Sethtro,"Jun 17, 2020",9/10,"Personal Rating: 9/10This movie shattered me. There's the expression that something ""tugs at your heartstrings,"" well this movie ripped mine out.I'll be honest, I could find things to critique about this film, the instance of a scene that was used twice and felt sloppy perhaps; but this movie never claimed to be perfect, just to be emotionally moving, and that it certainly is. This review is written by a boy who also finds himself on the edge of adolescence and adulthood, does that mean I'm biased, absolutely, but everyone who watches this film is, everyone can relate. Your feelings I can assure you will be the same as mine when the credits start rolling, rolling like the tears down your cheeks.This movie makes you think. Conformity is easy, conformity is comfortable, conformity gets you good grades, trust me you're listening right now to a past perfect GPA teacher's pet. The thing conformity doesn't give you though, is a life, one worth living. For something to be beautiful it must also have a side of danger, and that's what freedom of thought is, as is mentioned in the movie ""we must constantly look at things in a different way,"" and that's beautiful! Yes, it means at times we don't agree, yes it means you might give this movie a 4/10 but I'll be damned if that changes my opinion of it.The themes this movie explores such as, never letting a moment slip by where you don't think for yourself, where you don't seize an opportunity, it does so beautifully. Robin Williams was not acting he was believing, everything in this movie comes across as genuine, a slice of reality, a harsh but beautiful one at that.Will I watch this movie again, I don't think so.
But please, please watch it just once, you won't ever regret it.Carpe Diem."
CMTiago,"Aug 12, 2014",9/10,"It was with a sad reason that I re watched Dead Poets Society, as we lose yet another talent and an all round good person in Robin Williams. This being my favorite Williams film, I took it upon myself to honor his memory by remembering his best body of work, in my opinion. Mr. Keating is the teacher that I wish I had, and granted this might be a mixed opinion within the film's context, but the matter of the fact is that he was no ordinary teacher, and that's something you don't see very often.The thing about this film is that it doesn't shorten its importance to Williams's performance. The supporting cast is one that balances the film like no other. Every one of those students that revived the DPS is, in one way or another, influenced by Mr. Keating, be that positively or, unfortunately, negatively. The story being an Oscar winning screenplay, is one that I think mostly resonates with younger people, and with this movie being part of my 10th grade Portuguese course, I, personally, embraced its essence and of course its driving message of seizing the day.As I've seen here on IMDb, this movie might not gather nearly uncontested praise, but it is very much highly regarded today as it was 25 years ago. The final scene still gives me chills to this day, and in the midst of our sad goodbye to Mr. Williams I just wanna say Thank You My Captain. It was a pleasure learning to become my own motivated person. May we all Carpe DiemRating: 9/10"
Lk1990,"Jun 17, 2020",9/10,"Do not go where society tells you to. Find the things you love and pursue them with every fibre of your being until the day you die. That's the message I took from Dead Poets Society. Weird, inspiring and heartbreaking, DPS is a one of a kind film and one of the reasons Robin Williams is so renowned worldwide as not just a comedian, but a remarkable actor as well. After watching this movie you'll want to change the world. Amazing!"
fjhuerta-2,"Aug 22, 2001",10/10,"There are certain films that get under your skin, never to come out. They change your life, subtly altering your perceptions of reality, almost always for the better.Dead Poets Society is one of those few films.I saw the movie back when I was in High School. I had a teacher who told us that we really needed to watch it; in fact, it was our ""homework"" for the day. We didn't need to bring back a report, or talk about it in class. All he asked from us was to watch it, make up our own mind about it, and that was it. As you can imagine, many friends of mine didn't watch it at all; I did. And yes, I feel I changed a bit from there on.Back when you are young, you never really stop to think what in the world you are doing with your life. You simply live for the day, hope your grades will be enough to pass, and that's it. Long term thinking involves maybe flirting with a girl. Nothing more. What this film showed me was that we have the responsability and the joy of being alive in this planet. That we are dust, and we will go back to it, so we have precious little time to make a difference. That we have a moral obligation to ""seize the day, and make our lives extraordinary"" (my favorite quote in all movie history). That the world, basically is ours. That the only limitations are within ourselves, and that we owe it to us to fight, to rebel against conformity, to change what we hate and keep what we love. That living in this world is a beautiful responsability, and that only cowards dare not to change it for the better.The fact that the cast was basically my age, and was passing through the same dilemmas and situations I was facing made it all so much more powerful.So here I sit, 12 years from that day. I still don't think I have seized the day completely. But I keep on trying; I always will. I wonder how many people were transformed by this gem of a movie; I hope many.10 out of 10. A definitive masterpiece."
fred-kolb,"Nov 17, 2008",10/10,"Dead Poets Scoiety. I suppose if you were in High School sometime between 1990-2008, one of your teachers thought I'd be a good idea to watch this movie and I still remember my reaction and the ones of our fellow classmates: Yeah, probably a boring movie that will try to make the school look better and encourage us to do our homework and study for our tests. I couldn't have been more wrong. This movie definitely changed my way of thinking to a certain extent and there are very few films who have moved and touched me like this one.The movie plays in 1959 and centers around a private academy somewhere in New England. The curriculum is extremely difficult and the teachers have no humor and are very strict. The new English teacher though, Mr John Keating (Robin Williams), who graduated from the very same school, uses unorthodox, but quite effective methods to teach the students about literature, and poetry. During their first lesson, he tells them that they can either call him Mr. Keating or ""Oh Captain, my Captain"", based on a quote by Walt Whitman. He encourages them to come out of themselves, use their energy to make their lives worth living and beautiful - Carpe Diem, Seize the Day! The plot also centers around two students: Neil (Robert Sean Leonard), who is funny and popular, but fails to gain his fathers pride, because of his wish to become an actor, and Todd (Ethan Hawke), who is very shy and unsure of himself, and is inspired by Keating to use his imagination and eventually we find out that he is very talented when it comes to poetry. After they find out about a club Keating was a member of while he was a student, the Dead Poets Society, which was forbidden by the school, they decide to reestablish it, what ultimately gets them into a lot of trouble.There are several key factors, that make this movie as brilliant as it is. First of all there is the acting. Robin Williams, who I really like as a Comedian, really proves that he is a great actor, who can get deep into a character and play him with such passion and energy that you will forget he's an actor. Keating, whose teaching methods are indeed unusual and will probably make you laugh a couple of times, is a very interesting role, the teacher we all would have wanted, but not because he doesn't give homework or makes up very easy, open-book tests. No, because Keating shows us that we have to come out of ourselves, make the best of our lives and especially that there is a poet in everyone of us. Then there is the terribly under-appreciated Robert Sean Leonard, who also gives a very moving performance as a student, who is kept back by his father, and therefore fails to make his dreams come true. In my opinion he is very underused as an actor, and should have gotten a lot more leading roles. As for Ethan Hawke, he definitely was the best choice for the character he plays. We can literally feel his fear and shyness when he stands in front of the class and gets no word out, because he's so embarrassed.Peter Weir, who is probably most known for his recent movie ""Master and Commander"" shows what a great director he is with this film and it definitely deserved the Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and the nominations for Best Picture, Director and Leading Actor for Robin Williams.Some of you may have heard about Roger Ebert absolutely negative review of this movie and that ""he wanted to throw up at the end of the film"". I can understand why people might not like the ending (I won't put any spoilers), but I think it just adds to the the beauty and drama of this film, a film that should definitely be on the IMDb Top 250 Movies. This is a movie, you must have seen!!"
blissfulmitch,"Feb 4, 2005",10/10,"First of all, this is movie is my all-time favorite, out of all the hundreds of films I have seen. However, every time I mention this film, I have to answer most people's quizzical looks with ""It's a beautiful little 80s film that stayed in the 80s."" After seeing it for the 24th time since I first saw it 5 years ago, on my 13th birthday, I can gladly say that this movie went far and beyond the 80s, and the power and inspiration of the message can be felt every day.Dead Poets Society is a most underrated film by a most underrated director whose inspiring, uplifting and moral tales firmly grounded in reality are not nearly as appreciated as they should be. Here, we see one of his very personal and cradled projects, and he shows the visual style and concentration on characters in which he is so affluent. His control of the camera and the characters are very strong and very smooth. The cinematography is near perfect, with every shot, along with the editing, seamless. Also very compelling are the color-tones in every scene, perfectly matching the mood and events of the scene. Could you say this is art? Absolutely.Then we have the performances. Robin Williams continues in stride as one who has to-date remained the most touching, heart-wrenching, awe-inspiring comedians with inarguable acting talent (he still remains my most favorite performer on the film screen). His Professor John Keating is a man who embodies every professor who you thought was cool and respectable, every person who taught or enlightened you in something out of the ordinary. In fact - dare I say it? - he teaches something EXTRAORDINARY! We have the tragically underrated Robert Sean Leonard in his role as the free-thinking catalyst student Neil. Why is this man not a household name/Hollywood heavyweight? His roles are always full of inspiration, energy, and tragic emotion that never fail to move an audience. His role in this movie is fresh, unhindered, and never pretentious as the cautionary tale of the movie. And then we have Ethan Hawke in one of his earliest roles as the point-of-view character. The entire supporting cast is very strong, also, providing the foundation and serve as the various emotional ties that further involve us in the story. Josh Charles's role as Knox Overstreet is a role that almost all guys can relate to wholeheartedly. And of course, all the actors who are in that Dead Poets Society do a fine job.And lastly, the story. I won't summarize it since it's been summarized many times here, but I will say that it is one of the best coming of age stories for not only adolescents, but anyone. I have personally heard from nine-to-fivers who were inspired by this movie to change the situations of their jobs, careers, relationships for the better. I first saw this movie when I was 13, and immediately stamped, crowned and elevated this movie as my all-time favorite. Now that I am 18 and living on my own, with very different concerns than back then, I turn back to this movie over and over again, to find inspiration, solace and of course, entertainment. It is still my all-time favorite, and it still inspires me to seize the day and make my life extraordinary."
connie-baldini-427-561037,"Aug 12, 2014",10/10,"So today is August 12th and news has broken of Robin Williams' untimely death. I just felt compelled to review my favourite movie of his. On a rainy day back in 1980- something, my mother sat my brother, sister and me down and put on the movie, Dead Poets Society. Little did I know what a profound impact that movie, and its characters would have on me. The film is bursting with quotable material, and my siblings and I quote it to this day: O Captain My Captain, Carpe Diem, Seize the Day, and of course, Make Your Lives Extraordinary. It's not until we grow older that we can look back on a teacher like John Keating and see what he really meant to us, the chances he made us take, the way he made us feel alive. I look back now on Robin Williams' performance and see one of the most flawless performances of all time. When you watch the movie, it's hard to think of hammy, manic Robin Williams giving such a nuanced and subtle performance. It's almost as though Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting is who John Keating became. And funny how his most subtle performances may be the ones he's most remembered for. When I heard the news of Robin's death, I was taken back to this film and really felt how integral this movie actually was to my childhood. I think it was the first time my 10 year old self was truly ""moved"" in the way that adults can be moved by art. All I can say is watch this movie. You won't be sorry."
roghache,"Mar 3, 2006",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is, to use a cliché, a cinematic masterpiece. I can watch it over and over, absorbing more nuances of meaning every time. As a former teacher myself (albeit of science), I view it as a tribute to the profession at its best...teaching not merely the subject but also the person, and having a lifelong impact on students' lives.The setting is Weldon Academy, a very traditional New England boys' prep school in 1959. If I can find one flaw with the movie...and there certainly aren't many...it's the underlying premise that seems to worship free thought and implies that ALL tradition is of necessity undesirable and thus to be avoided. Frankly, compared to modern classrooms which are bastions of free expression, I found the Weldon students' respectful treatment of their teachers rather refreshing. (But perhaps that's just the ex-teacher in me coming out!) Some of Weldon's ideals, generally referred to in mocking tones, are actually qualities to which parents rightfully DO hope their offspring will aspire.Robin Williams plays Mr. Keating, the English teacher we all wish we'd had. He brings warmth, passion, and an endearing quiet humor to the role as he fosters individualism in a school environment of total conformity, endeavoring to teach these young men both the beauty of the English language and the importance of living life to the full, of ""seizing the day"". How many of us mentally revolted at the dissection of poetry when we were in school? Many a viewer will both chortle and rejoice when Mr. Keating has his class rip out the methodical, emotionless ""Introduction to Poetry"" from the time honored Pritchard textbook!The ""Dead Poets Society"", and the boys on which Mr. Keating has such a profound impact, include an interesting mix of characters...Neil Perry (the passionate young man at odds with his father's clearly defined expectations for his son's life), Todd Anderson (the classic shy adolescent, through whose eyes we view the unfolding drama), Charlie Dalton (the quintessential rebel), Knox Overstreet (the teen with whom most viewers can identify, deep in the throes of first love), and Richard Cameron (the mindless conformist).Ethan Hawke gives a moving performance as Todd, the younger brother of a former Weldon valedictorian and my personal favorite, who undergoes a character transformation as the plot unfolds. In a sense, this movie is really Todd's story. As another reviewer has wisely pointed out, his best scenes are sometimes when he has no dialogue at all. Your heart will ache for him. The sub-plot of young Overstreet's romance with a girl from a nearby school may not be brilliant, but it provides some light, entertaining relief from the main drama.Needless to say, Mr. Keating's unorthodox approach meets with obstacles...from his fellow teachers, from the school's ultra traditional Headmaster, from Neil's overbearing father and the other parents, who are depicted as a conservative, status conscious lot. His encouragement of adolescent individualism leads to dramatic consequences for one student in particular, triggering a dramatic scenario that engulfs most of his classmates. I don't want to give the plot away, but Dead Poets Society has the most powerful ending I've experienced in the cinematic world. I could watch it over and over, and tears would either come to my eyes or virtually stream down my cheeks every time.It's an intelligent film, both gripping to watch and thought provoking afterward. Engaging plot, memorable characters, meaningful theme, wonderfully done scenes and atmosphere...Dead Poets Society has it all. A special tip of my hat to the cinematography; clearly, it should have won an Oscar for the final scene alone.This is a must-see movie, especially if you're a high school student who hates English. It might just change your view of the subject, even if your actual teacher doesn't quite measure up to Mr. Keating. And for everyone...not only ""Carpe Diem"", but a certain phrase from a Walt Whitman poem will take on incredible meaning and be remembered forever."
pompaj,"Jul 17, 2000",N/A,There's so much good about this movie. The first time I saw it I watched it solely for plot and I loved it. Now I've seen it again and watched Peter Weir's filming and timing which is also great. Robin Williams is a terrific actor when he's serious. He proved it in Good Will Hunting but he proved it first here. If you liked that movie and your liking it had something to do with Williams than you will like this one. The plot is about a number of students who are taught by Williams about life. They are taught how to enjoy themselves. This ends up causing great controversy among the heads of the school. The students are terrific and even the dialogue is great. This is a movie that I can't imagine anyone not liking. It is good in every way.
anthonydapiii,"May 9, 2020",10/10,"A rare 10/10 and it's deserving of such. This movie had a profound impact on me....and no better person to play it then the great Robin Williams.He acted with such emotion and intensity and vigour in each scene. It is RARE to feel like I'm inside the film, but in this case I felt like Robin Williams was constantly talking to me in this film.Alongside him, the rest of the cast did a great job.This movie was more than just acting. It represented how a person should live and enjoy life. Thank you for such a gem."
ackstasis,"Dec 30, 2007",7/10,"Australian director Peter Weir's third picture in Hollywood, 'Dead Poets Society (1989),' doesn't really explore any territory that has not been covered before. For most of the film, we can pretty much predict exactly where Tom Schulman's screenplay is heading, and so there are few surprises to set it apart from other movies of its kind. However, despite his film's hint of unoriginality, Weir hardly puts a foot wrong, and 'Dead Poets Society' proves a thoughtful, funny, haunting and inspirational drama that'll certainly stay with you once you've seen it. Accompanying a cast of bright, young actors {some of whom you'll recognise from their later successes, including Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard} is comedy veteran Robin Williams, whose warmth and passion forms the emotional core of the story.The prestigious Welton Academy prep school (""Tradition, Honor, Discipline and Excellence""), as they're four-pillar motto suggests, has a long-standing history of success and high reputation. The young male students of the college are expected, at all times, to respect rules and authority, and to continually strive for greater and greater academic achievements. Into the school comes former student, now English teacher, John Keating (Williams), whose unorthodox approach to lessons, and vigorous passion towards literature and poetry, inspires many of his impressionable young students, and severely ruffles the feathers of Welton Academy's management. Keating's rousing motto of ""carpe diem"" (a Latin phrase meaning ""pluck/seize the day,"" borrowed from Horace's ""Odes 1.11"") inspires the young boys to make the most of every opportunity, and to look within themselves to discover the correct path for their lives.The film proved quite successful at the 1990 Academy Awards, acquiring an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay, and nominations for Best Actor (Robin Williams), Best Director (Weir's second nomination in that category) and Best Picture. Perhaps because of the preparatory school setting and the cast of young actors, 'Dead Poets Society' seems as though it would be most effective with young teenage boys, who will relish the film's opposition towards conformity and strict authority. Nevertheless, the film also boasts a more important moral from which we can all take something: always seize the opportunities that are presented to you, and make every day of your life count."
deanmasters,"Aug 20, 2001",5/10,"After all the hoopla, what really happens in this movie?  One kid kills himself, a teacher loses his job, and the system remains the same.  Why does the kid shoot himself?  Because he has a stock character of a dad that doesn't understand his son's desire to wear tights and spout poetry.  What is a lad to do?  Try and really stand up to dad?  No.  Try and talk to mom or another sympathetic ear that might be able to sway dad?  No. Run away from home until dad realizes he made a mistake?  No... wait, I got it: Blow your own skull off!   And what about the lad's mentor?  The teacher who dared to defy the system and take the fall?  All the desk stomping and Shakespearean one-liners didn't save his job or reputation in the end.  He leaves and the system wins again.  So did anything really change in this movie?  Doesn't really seem that way.   A couple kids were more ""enlightened"" I guess.  But how?  Ethan Hawke, whom I presume is the protagonist, watches his one pal kill himself in an act of cowardly selfishness, and his star teacher get crushed by the bureaucracy.This film was moving when I was in high school, but later viewings made me feel as if I'd been had. The film seemed to work for many people though. ""Oh Captain, My Captain"" was the equivalent of the filmmakers saying, ""Cry, audience people!  Cry!"". It certainly is affective among the those ""poor"", ""misunderstood"" souls, as I felt when I was 14.  Fortunately now, I know better."
chic1224,"Mar 28, 2000",10/10,"Not only will this movie touch your heart and bring tears, it will inspire you to be a better teacher to others and to follow your dreams no matter what the boundaries may be.  It is truly poetry on the screen... a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges.  If you haven't seen it yet, rent it now.  It has taken my love of poetry to an entirely new level!"
BlueRoseNya,"Sep 15, 2014",10/10,"Dead Poets Society was one of my favourite movies when I was about 12 years old. It was a long time ago since I'd last seen it and I kinda expected it to have lost something over the years. Not true at all. The story's message still very much applies today and always will: make something of your life, enjoy it as much as you can.When you watch this beautifully acted, directed and well shot film, you can't help but be genuinely be seized by emotion. Several scenes are stunning, yet it never gets sentimental and stays sincere throughout the whole film.Because he was such a fantastic emotional actor, Robin Williams was the perfect choice to play John Keating, an original English teacher who wants his students to think for themselves, not only about poetry but also about life itself. If there'd be a John Keating in every school, the world might just become a little more interesting.Definitely a must-see classic."
jchckid,"Mar 19, 2001",10/10,"The film Dead Poets Society is a film that explores the idea of ""Carpe Diem"" (seize the day) from the viewpoint of a classroom of young men at an all boys boarding school. Their teacher Mr. Keating (played by Robin Williams)helps them stretch their minds, and exercise their right to defiant acts of love for life and poetry, rebuttlng society. The director Peter Weir treats you with eye candy by using various camera shots of beautiful scenary, and neat techniques. Weir takes you on a roller coaster that leaves you gripping your seat, enjoying life, and thinking ""Carpe Diem"" in your own life. There are some very depressing scenes, but they are very artful, and teach you of appreciation for those brave members of society that dare stand up for their beliefs, and rights to wrestling around with life. I thought Ethan Hawke (Todd Anderson) gave a true life twist to the film, Robin Williams (Mr. Keating or also known as Captain my captain) added an element of excitement, and Robert Sean Leonard (Neil Perry)added passion that leaves you mesmerized. I just saw this film in English class, but I immediatly fell in love with it, as I know you will."
imseeg,"Jun 18, 2020",9/10,"A wonderfully, touching uplifting portrait of teenagers coming of age, learning how to think for themselves and experiencing how to live LIFE to the FULLEST, inspired by an unconventional, loving English teacher played brilliantly by Robin Williams, which is one of his best roles of his entire career.Dramas dont come any better than this one. BUT it isnt a drama for the first hour, because it starts out as an uplifting, vivacious portrait of teenagers at a strict boarding school, where everybody is suffocated by RULES and more rules, UNTIL that special day teacher Robin Williams starts teaching.This movie can be seen by young and old, but I guess especially young people would really be impressed by it, because this movie, like no other, depicts with suffocating reality, the pressures kids can be burdened with when they have to OBEY their parents' will and wishes and when their own creativity and passions are stifled with ruthless restrictions and punishments by their parents and their ""teachers""...Right now I still have goosebumps merely thinking about this movie. It's so profoundly, impressive and touching and uplifting. One of the best dramas ever! Yes, EVER!"
natalia1818,"Dec 31, 2004",10/10,"I watched this movie today for about 15-th time. I'm never bored with it. A few hours ago I felt lonely and depressed.I decided to watch it without the scenes that evoke sadness.And even though I watched it so many times before I found it restorative and heart lifting. There are many good films.Also there are probably many better than this one;cause it's not flawless. But if you believe that a movie can change your life, I have no doubts that this one can influence you as no other. If you have not watched it yet, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR? Go to the video rentals and buy it.Yes, don't rent it but buy it.It's a movie that you will watch many times.Perhaps it will even save you..As it had saved me.."
okcbaskeball2,"Nov 20, 2024",7/10,"Great tearjerker What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle."
Theo Robertson,"Apr 1, 2003",5/10,"How can anyone feel moved by DEAD POET`S SOCIETY ? It`s got to be one of the most overrated and sugar coated films ever made . I`ve seen more reality in LORD OF THE RINGSFirst up is the rich kids schoolboy characters . Come on surely they are amongst the most unlikable people on Earth . Fortunate , spoiled rotten , dripping with money and who let the world and his wife know it , nothing about the boys here rings true . The strongest thing they put in a pipe is hand rolling tobacco ? Yeah right .Secondly there`s the teachers . I know I can speak for all of us when I say there were certain teachers at school who made our lives a total misery , you know the ones I`m talking about , they make the gestapo look like social workers and whose only function in life was to show us that injustice and sadistic cruelty do indeed exist in a democratic country . I guess that DEAD POET`S SOCIETY tries to make that point too but it fails . The "" bad "" teachers here are shown as being stuffy disciplinarians who do everything by the book but there`s no one here that you can describe as being the worst nightmare of your own schooldaysAnd has this film got anything against Shakespere ? FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING feels it might have been written and acted ( Especially by Ian McKellen and Sean Bean ) in a Shakespere style . DEAD POET`S SOCIETY most certainly isn`t , so why does the film put the boot into the great bard ?DEAD POET`S SOCIETY isn`t an awful film , but neither is a great one . It`s spoiled by an infusion of sentimentality at the expense of reality . I do concede that Williams is rather good in the role of John Keating , performed at a time when he was known only as a manic comedy actor , but Williams alone isn`t really enough to hold your attention in a film that feels overlong"
AlsExGal,"Aug 4, 2023",8/10,"... and yet it has grown on me to where it is one of my favorites.When I first saw this in the theater I felt disappointed and baited and switched. Robin Williams may be top billed, but he is not the center of the film although he is the motivating character. He is a new teacher at an elite private school for boys that has traditions that probably nobody remembers the reasons for. Williams' character is out of step with the rest of the faculty at the school and encourages his students to seize the day. Anyone who grew up with the overbearing-we-expect-more-out-of-you parents, or even attended boarding school, or grew up in some similar environment can identify with the students in the film.Every aspect of this film is powerful. From screenplay to direction, casting to acting, the movie drags us into a world of teenagers that are REAL. Sometimes funny, sometimes sad, sometimes rebellious ... sometimes they win, sometimes they lose. This is very much a Peter Weir film. The screenplay is one the most powerful ones ever, and one characteristic of this movie is the evolution the characters go through. Just like Truman Show, Witness, The Last Wave and Fearless, Weir drags his characters into the story and changes them. He evolves them so that, in the end, his characters are more human and feel something beyond traditional beliefs and codes; Things that people have died for throughout history: Freedom, Respect, Pride... things that may not be that important to an average person, things that make one a hero."
kbmoshea,"Jun 17, 2001",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is a thoroughly moving, and inspiring film from Peter Weir, who is definitely one of the most under rated directors around. This movie is in the same vein as ""A Separate Peace"", in the sense of setting, and in the general coming of age story line. The basic message is to ""suck the marrow out of life"", as the passage for the society reads, or to live every moment to the fullest. It is inspiring and uplifting for the first hour and 15 minutes or so, before changing stride altogether to a somewhat depressing but remarkable conclusion. This is a must see."
g-bodyl,"Jun 22, 2013",9/10,"Dead Poets Society is a much better film than I anticipated. Honestly, I thought this would be a film all about poetry and I loathe poetry, so I didn't give this film a chance. I'm glad I did because this is not a film about poetry, but about a group of college kids who have been encouraged to follow their own dreams. This film is a well-made drama that will make you smile, laugh, and cry. It also has one of the most unexpected scenes I have seen in awhile.Peter Weir's film is about a group of college kids who are inspired by their English professor, John Keating. Keating tells his kids who follow their dreams and they do just that. Unfortunately, the dean and the parents have other ideas for their kids.Robin Williams gives a true, inspirational performance as John Keating. He is the teacher that is common nowadays, but someone my parents would yearn to have. Ethan Hawke delivers a stand out performance as one of the kids and so does Robert Sean Leonard.Overall, this is a truly inspirational film that has one simple message for all people, especially younger ones. This message is ""Follow our dreams and don't let anyone tell you what you can or can't do."" This message should have been used back in the 1950's-1960's. This film is well-acted, has great direction, and should leave a tear or two. I rate this film 9/10."
tibman,"Sep 21, 2005",10/10,"First of all, I would like to say that my English is not that good, but I think I can make myself understandable.This movie made a big impression on me, I saw it for the first time, I think just 2 years ago, I did not heard about this movie before.One of my favorite actors is Mr. Robin Williams and his playing his part here, as usual perfect.I totally agree with the one message of the movie, that parents should not put so much pressure on their children and let them take their own decisions.I like poetry as well and one of my favorite moments in the movie is when the character Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) has to tell his poem in front of the class but he has none and is challenged from his teacher to improvise.... The result is for me one of the most beautiful things I ever heard.So let's end my ""comment"".This movie is one of the ""best ever made""!"
bkoganbing,"Jul 22, 2017",9/10,"The conformist 50s get a look in Dead Poet's Society. Seen through the eyes of several prep school kids it's only that several of them really grasp what Robin Williams is trying to teach them that we see hope for the future.Williams is one of those rare teachers whose unorthodox methods make him stand out. There will always two or three for me in every level of learning that I had who stuck with me. The kids at Welton Prep actually enjoy his poetry class, they even found a little private club the Dead Poet's Society and will quote Byron, Browning, and the Bard back and forth to each other.The difference between Williams and someone like Norman Lloyd the headmaster at Welton Prep is that Lloyd sees himself as training the future membership of the establishment and he's giving them the lessons they need to get by, Williams says that his function to tell the youth to question authority. Always ask why this is so. Progress is only made by those who ask questions.The film is mainly the story of two students in his class Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. Leonard is a shy kid and Hawke is a popular one. But Hawke is not from a wealthy family. His father Kurtwood Smith has made many sacrifices to get him into that prep school. Hawke wants to be an actor and Williams says follow your dream. Their clash sets in motion the dramatic events of the climax.Dead Poet's Society won an Oscar for Best Original Screenplay and was nominated for Best Picture, Best Director as well. Williams got a nomination for Best Actor. Dead Poet's Society maybe set in the 50s, but it expresses a universal theme about always question the status quo until you get a satisfying answer.Progress never happens any other way."
gavin6942,"Apr 11, 2015",7/10,"English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) inspires his students to discover their love for poetry and seize the day.This is a story about what one teacher (or a mentor of any kind) can do to inspire the youth, whether it be for good or evil. Those viewing this film will generally see it as a force for good, a call to ""seize the day"". And that is probably the correct interpretation.But interestingly, the call for non-conformity leads to its own kind of conformity. And one could argue that Keating's power is not much different than that of a politician or cult leader. Had he chosen to use it differently, he could have been a very dangerous force in these young men's lives. In fact, we see not everyone who followed his path was better because of it."
ExpendableMan,"Oct 8, 2007",7/10,"Best known for it's (in)famous 'oh Captain my Captain' sequence, Dead Poets Society's biggest problem is the clichés it invented for the high school movie drama. Today's jaded audiences might smirk at such examples as the shy boy finding the confidence to express himself through the help of a rebellious teacher, or the purity of youthful romance, but to the film's eternal credit, this was fresh ground after a decade of teen sex comedies. Dead Poets Society's teenagers aren't simply lust crazed hormone bags that wander into embarrassing social accidents every fifteen minutes, they're a tad more realistic...for most of the film at least. When the movie ventures into darker territory in the closing quarter it falters, becoming an awkward attempt at manipulating emotions that jars against the promising story told in the beginning.Set in a prestigious school where the upper lips are stiff, the shirts stuffed and the emotions repressed, a class of teenage boys find their new English teacher John Keating (Robin Williams) taking a slight detour from the established curriculum. Encouraging them to think outside the box rather than be restricted by school-approved guidelines, he not only provides them with a full appreciation and love of poetry, but also a fresh mindset that focuses on seizing the day and acting on impulse. Soon, the boys are exploring various avenues of life (one becomes an actor, another pursues a local girl etc...) while their parents look on disapprovingly and the identikit old-fashioned teachers with grey hair and suits start trying to interfere.What is most striking about this whole enterprise is that despite its reputation, there isn't a laugh to be had anywhere. This is not a Robin Williams comedy-drama, it's just a drama and the comedian suits the role perfectly. He is convincingly charismatic and just sentimental enough to stop you from choking on your own vomit, this is Robin Williams the actor, not Robin Williams the clown. However, he's also more of a supporting character, as the chief focus is on the boys (including Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke in their younger days) and they all play their characters well. Hawke is probably the best, his tearful breakdown in a snow covered field being surprisingly effective, but they all hold their own against the more experienced actors.Shame then about the closing part of the story. With a sudden about turn, the film changes from an account of the individual versus the machine into a teenage suicide yarn all too quickly. This wouldn't be a problem if more time had been taken, but the character involved seems to decide to kill himself with as much ease as the rest of us pick what to have for lunch at work. And while I'm not an expert on teenage depression, I'd like to think it takes more for a young lad to blow his own head off than simply running into life's first obstacle.Dead Poets Society therefore is ultimately a promise that wasn't completely fulfilled as the subtle, intelligent storytelling is blown out of the water by the mishandling of the closing scenes. Consequently, if you're anything like me, you'll spend most of the film trying to guess which kid pops his clogs. It's an enjoyable and involving drama, but as a tear-jerker it fails to move. Williams is excellent as always though and for seventy five percent of the time, Dead Poets Society is a great film."
FernAshes,"Apr 5, 2003",8/10,"I'm impressed. It was an all around good film. Perhaps I'm biased - Robert Frost's poem, A Road Not Taken, was quoted - yet so many other things were as well.It's not about poetry. It's about how you look at the world. How you look, how others look... how you think, how you feel... and a warning to never, ever become conformist (though being conformist about walking is perhaps slightly exaggerated). Never become conformist - always make up your own mind.I liked the music, as well. The bag pipes give a certain special touch.I gave it an 8/10 - a high score for me."
taratua,"Apr 18, 2017",9/10,"This film ends up on top 10 and 100 lists so often that I think many people (me included!) have a tendency to overlook it and think of it as composed only of those key visual scenes, a story told in fragments of the familiar. Rewatching it recently, however, I was reminded of how brilliant Robin Williams' performance is and how effectively the viewer is also drawn into the group, another member of the secret society, another person holding something important close and willing to defend it. A true classic."
kjs_0116,"Apr 5, 2015",10/10,This was the first time I watch this movie. I will probably see this movie again. I recommend this movie to people in Korea because it's relevant in Korea's high pressure education system. The movie is a good antidote to the conformism in Korea. I'm sure young students like myself will find the movie quite inspiring.Apart from the fact that it resonated with my own situation I can also say the acting is superb and the plot gripping.It struck me too that the language in the movie is very engaging and encouraging for someone like me - a non-native speaker to go on developing my English skills.
HarshVardhan,"Apr 6, 2020",10/10,"Not every thing that's expected from you is your only motive of life. This movie in a great manner teaches us to listen and regard the voice of our soul, the voice of our self.Basically the story is about a English Literature professor Mr. John Keating who is a replacement for the previous professor and is conducting his very first class for the school. His idea of teaching is very different and informal, based more on practicality rather than just reading words written in the book. Being literature his subject, he inspires his students to weave their own thoughts, he encourages them to use their own imaginations. He clearly believes that everybody has their own personal sense of seeing this world, interpretating things in their own way.The influence of Mr. Keating on the boys can be judged from their inclining interests towards poetries and proses. They reframe Dead Poets Society which is a kind of club of people reading out poetries among the group. Meanwhile, they also learn to listen to their calling. And then series of events goes on and by the end of that, you will be left with tears in your eyes.Everything in the movie is so perfectly done. The character of Mr. Keating played by Robin Williams is flawless. The smirk on his face puts a different charm and it always keeps you under impression of his control over the situation. Also the character of Neil played by Robin Sean Leonard keeps you gripped to the emotions that the movie is carrying throughout.This is a kind of movie that will make you think about yourself, your dreams and desires. You will be left with the tears of happiness and a sense of introspection. Moreover, if you have interest in writing or have given it a try sometime, this movie is surely going to boost your morale and confidence."
aaliyahhaider,"May 29, 2016",10/10,"There are some movies you watch for fun, there are some movies you watch just to pass time and then there are movies that have a massive effect on your life. This is one of those movies. Dead Poets Society is a coming of age movie that teaches us that life is not only about growing up to have a nice job due to a good education. Life is to be lived with passion, with excitement. Out of all the movies I have watched in the short span of my life, this is by far the best one. Despite the fact that it is from the '80s it continues to inspire people all around the world. Dead Poets Society is an underrated movie with an underrated director. This movie is purely a piece of art, every scene fits seamlessly with the other. The colors, the hues, the lighting matches with every emotion that is displayed in each scene throughout the movie.Each actor in this movie has amazing skills. First of all, Robin Williams, he has made a place in our hearts from every single heart-wrenching, soul-touching performance on the screen to this date. This movie is no less than the others. Professor John Keating embodies a man that everyone wishes to have as a teacher, he dares to teach things that are more than what you normally hear in a classroom. He shows us the extraordinary, he teaches us how to live, how to feel and most importantly; how to be human. Then, we have Robert Sean-Leonard as Neil Perry, once more extremely underrated. His roles are always filled to the brim with inspiration and emotion. The entire supporting cast is amazing, they provide to the foundation of this movie, without them this movie would not have the same emotional impact.This movie is a diamond in the rough. It's not difficult for one to fall in love with such a movie. Filled with beautiful scenes, plot twists and numerous references to poets and their works, you are bound to fall in love with the English language."
cjblume,"Mar 23, 2022",7/10,"After all these years I have never seen this film and I'm sorry it took me this long. Dead Poets Society impressively captures the internal deliberation of young, impressionable men to both take direction from their leaders and role models and at the same time chart their own path against questionable influence and authority. Until the unthinkable occurs, these boys travel through the story displaying all of the wonderment of adolescent development with infectious optimism. After experiencing tremendous loss, the conflict between them shows the struggle each character faces in determining the extent to which they're willing to uphold their developing convictions."
bwilkening,"Jun 7, 2006",4/10,"Well, I remember loving this movie when I first saw it 15 years ago in junior high, but perhaps the film's main theme of a young, convention-defying teacher challenging kids to think freely and ""seize the day"" (an injunction that was repeated ad nauseum, even by a kid who used it as justification for molesting a passed-out girl) has been mimicked so many times that it just isn't novel anymore. More than that, however, the film has a number of inherent flaws.Williams plays Keating, an English professor who has just arrived at a prep school run by an authoritarian type who is hell-bent on adhering to the institution's guiding principles of tradition and discipline. Williams literally appears to be the only teacher at the school under the age of 95. Williams throws around a lot of quotes, but the full context and meaning of the quotes or the poems from which they are plundered are never explored but are rather exploited to make a cheap point. Whitman's ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"" is invoked merely b/c Keating wants the students to call him that. At one point Keating gets in an argument with an older teacher who questions his teaching methods, and both engage in a competition of trading quotes from poems. Have any two people in the entire history of humankind ever argued like this? Just curious.So what are these teaching methods that have the school's elders so worried? Well, most of Keating's classes seem to take place outside. He has the students do things like walk around in a courtyard (so they can ""choose their own direction"") or recite poems while kicking a ball. He also has them stand up on desks. Keating is apparently a rugby coach as well. At least, I am assuming this, because of the shot in which the kids are playing rugby and Keating is running along the sidelines like an idiot with his hands over his head. Keating doesn't care for textbooks, having students tear out the introduction to a textbook in which it is claimed that poems can be judged on two dimensions and then plotted on an axis. Did such textbooks actually exist back then? What poetry scholar would make such a ridiculous claim? It just seemed as if the filmmakers were setting up a straw man that Keating's character could knock down.Williams does a decent job with the script that he has to work with. The young actors who played the students were also decent, including a young Ethan Hawke. All of the other characters, who include the school principle, as well as the parents of one of the kids who kills himself, are one dimensional caricatures. This kid kills himself because his domineering father won't permit him to act; such frivolous extracurricular activities, the father claims, will interfere with the father's intentions to send his kid to Harvard to become a doctor. Okay, I had one question. Even assuming that the father sees the fine arts as a distraction from more practical concerns, why in the hell would acting in a play hurt his son's chances of going to Harvard? Don't schools value extracurricular activities? In any case, the father's opposition to his son's acting ambitions is wholly disproportionate, as is the son's failure to realize that once he is in college he will be more independent.Overall, I think that this film had something to say before the emergence of alternative teaching styles, but it just seems incredibly outdated now."
maddiebuggie,"Apr 28, 2020",9/10,"I wasn't sure when I first start to watch it. If it would be as good as people kept telling me. But luckily it was so good. I loved the plot, storyline, characters. The character development was great. I loved that the teacher was trying to teach the kids what believed was good even when the school tried to make him be quite. I highly recommend everyone watch this movie at least once in there life."
slightlymad22,"Jan 16, 2015",8/10,"After recently watching ""Mrs Doubtfire"" And then ""Old Dogs"" a movie from the latter part of the late Robin Williams's career. I decided to revisit some of his earlier dramatic work. And one phrase came tonight ""Oh Captain, my Captain"". so I immediately settled on 1988's ""Dead Poets Society"".I also forgot about this brilliant quote. ""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary"" I don't know if it was the tagline for the movie, but it certainly should have been.Plot In A Paragraph: Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) has been sent to the school where his popular older brother was valedictorian. His room-mate, Neil Parry (Robert Sean Leonard), although very bright and popular, is under the thumb of his controlling father (Kurtwood Smith) The two, along with their other friends, meet Professor Keating (A brilliant Robin Williams in one of his serious moods) their new English teacher, who tells them of the Dead Poets Society, and encourages them to seize the day, and make their lives extraordinary.For an actor well known for his comedic roles, Robin Williams is in fact, a very effective dramatic actor. Kurtwood Smith is his usual reliable self as Mr Perry, the dominating father, and all of the ""boys"" do well in their roles. Ethan Hawke is especially good, likewise Josh Charles, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Henson.Some may find it boring, and it is slow in parts, but Williams's performance more than papers over the few cracks. Touching, Tragic and humorous in places. The final ""Oh Captain, my Captain"" is spine tinglingly good!! And if be lying if I didn't say I welled up a bit. It really is a very good movie. One that deserves to be seen."
willcundallreview,"Aug 7, 2015",9/10,"I watched this movie near one year after the tragic death of Robin Williams, and only for the first time. I had heard about the ""O Captain! My Captain!"" thing and knew it was a very popular film, but what I wasn't prepared for was how deeply emotional it is, and how much it resonates with the passing of Williams. This is a movie that although could be described as trying too hard for emotion, still just makes you want to smile, you want these boys to break out of their closed off traditional world and do what they want to do in life.The story is about an elite prep boarding school and its students, where some are being worked hard as they await the day they enter college. But in comes Mr Keating, a new English teacher who's ways don't exactly impress the hard up parents and teachers, who's values are very much the underpinning of what the young students despise. The story has its ways of making Williams just great to watch; the young guys who act here work well alongside him and make this a movie that has no central character, but a central story to share.Directed by Peter Weir, the movie is not all about Robin Williams and the famous scenes that are involved. In fact Weir gives just a fine performance as any other, his directing is finely done and he knows how to control the emotion of the film so that it isn't always one tone. Tom Schulman whose experiences inspired this movie, creates a beautiful script, in fact I am not quite sure if is Weir or Schulman who make this special, but in any case both are on great form.The rest of the cast pitch in well too, a young Ethan Hawke as the painfully shy Todd is OK, I am not sure if he is good but in any case his more emotional side is fascinating when done. Josh Charles as Knox is also good and the other boys involved such as Robert Sean Leonard are good also. I found if any part of the movie stops this from utter perfection, then the acting is what it is, by no means bad but sometimes a little over the top. As for Williams's nomination for an Academy Award, well maybe I agree, I mean his acting is great here and although I've seen some criticise his comic side coming out here, I for one don't think it was a bad thing.When you get a film that just makes you think, you know it is fairly special, but one that adds into it emotion too, then it starts to become sublime. This film knows how to challenge perception, and even though this is set in 1959 and made in 1989, the ideas that Keating uses are still inspirational today, and the way in which he talks about poetry can at times be most beautiful. I think again a lot of praise goes to Schulman for creating a script that can mean a lot to someone, watch this at just the right age and this could blow your mind, it really could.Is it for everyone? well it should be, a movie I would highly recommend to someone even if they don't usually like this kind of movie, simply because of the thought process involved. It isn't even too long, I felt maybe for it to one of the best ever, it had to maybe have had an even better ending than it already does, which is a really fine ending by the way. It should keep you gripped throughout, it never made me feel bored or like I had better things to do, it was a rare movie that spoke to me and opened my mind as I feel the people behind this wanted it to do."
ramblingvagabond,"Apr 29, 2020",8/10,"In the fall of 1987, filming had already begun at Berry College, Rome, Georgia. Berry had a set of very old buildings that were designed to look like the buildings at Oxford College in England. These buildings had attracted many filmmakers before. When I visited that fall, they had gone to great lengths to make it look like a more north eastern college, making the trees and landscaping appear in later stages of autumn. We were all very excited, despite the strange name of the movie they were filming - Dead Poets Society.Unfortunately, they changed their mind. They decided to scrap all the footage the were shooting at Berry College, and move production to a different school. I didn't realize they had changed locations until I went to see the film after its release. I went with high expectations but all I could do was look at the buildings and background and think, ""That's not Berry.""So even though it was a great film, I still lament that Berry College was dropped and another school chosen, and that Berry does not go down in history as the location where Dead Poets Society was filmed."

SnoopyStyle,"Apr 11, 2014",7/10,"Smart and popular Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) has a domineering father (Kurtwood Smith) who controls his son. Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is his new shy roommate in the high class Welton Academy boarding school. John Keating (Robin Williams) is their new English teacher who teaches his students all about living life to the fullest... Carpe Diem. Neil finds an old senior annual where Keating was a part of the Dead Poets Society. The boys decide to resurrect the Society.The young cast is pretty good led by the quiet Ethan Hawke and a good leading man in RSL. Of course, the teacher in these types of movies is what sells it. Robin Williams controls his wilder instincts to create a very compelling character. It's a little too much poetry for me, but I like the movie otherwise especially the performances."
Howlin Wolf,"Apr 27, 2006",7/10,"... Speaking for myself, I don't want to spend a large amount of time in the company of young men who need *permission* to be themselves. If teacher John Keating's role necessitated 'guidance', THEN I could understand, but it doesn't. They all show themselves to have a certain amount of gumption and intelligence outside of the classroom; so why once they get in there are they portrayed as spineless saps who need to be taken by the hand and 'shown the way'?!Keating (Williams) didn't seem to me to have as much effect as I was led to expect and hoped for as I watched. This was more about the boys just being lucky enough to have a role-model standing in front of them who didn't fit societal norms at the time. The kids weren't taught anything much beyond learning how to follow their own instincts, and really, shouldn't fraternising with your peers teach you to do that adequately enough?!It's hard to feel sympathy for people who've got all the raw materials already there; but appear to be so feckless that they need to be *pushed* in order to put them to use! Films that show mentoring the disadvantaged are easier to get behind because you're rooting for the underdogs; there's just no such incentive, in this case. This may be much better made than material like ""Dangerous Minds"", but at least in that case there's more 'antagonism' going on underneath the surface...I still enjoyed the film greatly; but making the circumstances of the pupils more sympathetic straight from the get-go would have turned this film into one of my all-time favourites..."
AE_BS_CH,"Feb 17, 1999",2/10,"Actually, the topic of this film could be quite interesting. Its narrative, as I view it, is characterised by the move from bad to worse. It offers considerable psychological insight into how easily students, in a very strictly ordered environment that gives them very little freedom, can fall pray to a kind of sectarian leader who demands that they worship him as their 'captain' and lose the sense of reality.Two very different faces of totalitarianism are contrasted in a very interesting way. In principle, it should not matter that much that this is probably not what was intended.Dostoyevski, for instance, was a staunch conservative who propounded a conservative nationalist and religious ideology, which did not prevent him from writing novels that show an astonishing variety of ideological and philosophical topoi. Therefore, it should not matter that much that, as it seems, the totalitarian action of the teacher was probably intended as a positive contrast to the strict order that is there at the college. But, in my view, in this case, the ideological purpose nevertheless affects the quality of this film. It is good for provoking thought about sectarian totalitarianism, but that's all. The pervasiveness of the ideological purpose dominates the whole story so much that most of the interesting qualities of the situation get lost.I would say that this is a most typically American film, in the slightly derogatory sense this word often has to Europeans when used in cultural issues: It is dominated by ideas, such as freedom, but the words remain empty, devoid of liveliness, and there is not the slightest hint of the idea that flight from authoritarian order could mean something else than following a sectarian leader. I do not object to depicting such bleakness in movies, and it must probably be regarded as an achievement of this film that it can produce such repulsion in people who are not familiar with this kind of authoritarian society, but the bleakness is disguised in such a nice and kitschy American stereotypes, such as striving for freedom, that I find it just bad taste."

We may even become better for it but occasionally we may not and more often than not, we won't even know how we got there.There's little to like about a wealthy boys only establishment, without ethnic or demographic diversity, run by white middle aged and older men, chained to their dogma and traditions. If, however, you can take hold of the universal message Robin Williams so elegantly and poetically espouses, then maybe, if you're fortunate enough to be washed onto the shore of a similarly inspirational mentor, tutor, teacher or friend, no matter where you are on your journey, just maybe, just maybe, they'll raise enough of a breeze to change your direction. If that new direction takes you away from the rocky coastline of cavernous dogma, and continues to do so for the rest of your days, then the world, your world, will be a far better place for it, regardless of your demography, ethnicity, history or where on the planet your journey begins or continues.

It doesn't hurt that Robin Williams is one of my favorite performers, either.  This film came out during the summer before my first year at Indiana University and gave me some much needed confidence and inspiration as I started a new chapter in my life.  I still go back to this film when I'm feeling a little down or if I need a kick in the pants.

monkeysgalore,"May 4, 2020",10/10,"A thoughtful, moving, uplifting film, Dead Poets Society is about a teacher's relationship with his students, and how he helped them to grow and have a better quality of life through poetry.The performances were mostly strong all around, with the central characters being surprisingly solid and well-fleshed out for such young actors. The camaraderie between the boys was nice and believable, I thought they portrayed their friendship realistically. Robin Williams steals the show in every scene he's in, and I don't think he ever got his due as a dramatic actor. Sure he's a great comedy actor, but this andGood Will Hunting (1997)cement his obvious dramatic talent for any doubters. He too is believable in his role, and he develops a believable relationship with his students.Is Peter Weir not one of the greatest directors out there? He has such a good body of work, and his dramatic style and look are ever present here. I can't quite describe the feel of his films, but it's there. If you enjoyedWitness (1985)orMaster and Commander: The Far Side of the World (2003)of the World, than you'll appreciate this effort from Weir. It may be his best film.The movie's message and philosophy are admirable, too. The goal of taking every moment and living life instead of letting time slip away is important, and the emotional story surrounding the teacher's relationship with his students and how if affected their relationships is also moving and well-structured. The aspect of people being brought closer together through art and an appreciation of it is also interesting. Some may argue that non-conformity was the message, and that the film's ending goes against that, but I think non-conformity and defending one's own beliefs was displayed in the ending, and non-conformity is only part of the overall point anyway.I definitely can recommend this, though many have seen it already anyway. It's definitely one of Williams' best performances, and Weir's best films. If you ever needed inspiration to read poetry, this is the best place to start."

carabiner86,"Nov 29, 2002",6/10,"I think hailing this movie as a classic is a bit too much, but bashing it as a dud is also too extreme.The movie hoped to be one of those absolutely outstanding, feel-good flicks that changes peoples' lives. It isn't that, and sometimes the stretching it does to try to be so great makes the audience squeam.It has some good points, good lines, and in my humble opinion, excellent actors portraying the boys in the Society. I am not a big fan of William's casting as Keating though.The script is a little cliche and the fact that a bunch of fairly popular boys would want to gather and read poetry together is also a bit extreme. I guess what I'm saying is their portrayal of the boys themselves is overall unrealistic (When Neil grabs a cape and runs up and down, excited he's going to be in Midsummer Night's Dream? Teenage boys would not typically do that).However with all that said, the message of the movie is fabulous. The teaching style of Keating is impressive and, contrary to what most people would think, there are teachers out there who approach teaching in a very unorthodox way and reach their students like no other can. I am a high school student and have seen some of these teachers.I liked the ending, however bombastic some may call it. Definately watch it, maybe even buy it, but don't expect *too* much."
cutehershey,"Nov 3, 2007",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is one of the few films that are hard to forget once watched. This film is an influential film that is capable of changing how we see reality and life. It's about an extraordinary English teacher named John Keating, who uses unique ways through literature and poetry, to teach his students about life. He once said in the film, ""We don't read and write poetry because it's cute. We read and write poetry because we are members of the human race. And the human race is filled with passion. And medicine, law, business, engineering  these are noble pursuits and necessary to sustain life. But poetry, beauty, romance, love  these are what we stay alive for."" The film was opened in a well known prestigious Welton Academy which was an all-boys prep school. The school was popular for its four principles: tradition, honor, discipline and excellence. There was a group of friends which was consisted of: Neil Perry, Todd Anderson, Knox Overstreet, Charlie Dalton, Richard Cameron, Steven Meeks and Gerard Pitts.Neil Perry was a student that excelled in many subjects in school. He did everything that his father wanted him to do. When Mr. Keating told him to seize the day and to live an extraordinary life, he defied his father's wishes. He followed his dream, acting on stage, which was not approved by his father. He was pulled out of the school. He wanted to tell his father his own decisions but, he did not succeed and opted to commit suicide using his father's gun.Todd Anderson was a shy boy. He had an older brother who also studied on the same school. That's why he needed to live up to his reputation. He also thought that everything inside of him is worthless and embarrassing. Mr. Keating proved him wrong, he told him that he knew that something inside him was worth a great deal. And from that day on, his life was heavily influenced and changed.Knox Overstreet was a persistent guy. He met a girl named Chris and instantly fell in love with her. He desired to see her after their first encounter. Later on, he realized that Chris already had a boyfriend. Yet he persisted in courting her. He didn't care if he gets punched or humiliated. He used poetry in wooing Chris. He even said ""She's gonna hate me. The Danburrys will hate me. My parents will kill me. All right, goddamn it. You're right. Carpe diem. Even if it kills me."" Charlie Dalton was a rebel and a dare devil. He did anything that pleased him. He once took his personal freedom too far and published an article that proposed girls to be allowed at Welton to give the boys some pleasure. The authorities learnt of it and interrogated Charlie. Charlie told them that he acted alone. Later in the story, he changed his name to Newanda.John Keating is an extraordinary teacher. He used unusual teaching methods that any other ordinary teachers won't approve of. He taught outside the classroom, tried different approaches and ensured that it was not boring. He hated the idea of learning literature by doing scales of quality and popularity ratings. Instead, he ensured that his students learned to stretch their minds, to think for themselves and to exercise their own rights to defy acts of love for literature and life. He simply was a one of a kind and an amazing teacher.One of the things that John Keating emphasized was ""Carpe Diem"" which meant seize the day, make your lives extraordinary. He showed his students a picture of former Welton students in a trophy case. He explained that they were once like them. Each one of them was full of their own hopes and dreams. Only they themselves knew if they made their lives extraordinary since these alumni are now dead.This made the group of friends revive an old literary club called the Dead Poets Society. Neil Perry once read ""I went to the woods to live deliberately, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, and not when I came to die, that I had not lived."" This simply tells us that being a member of the Dead Poets Society meant that they have decided that they won't be held as captives by their fathers or anyone else anymore. They will decide on their own and do thing that they want to do. Nobody can stop them, not even death. What matters is that they followed their own paths. This would be the only way for them to experience everything that life has to offer; everything that they had not experienced when they were enslaved from their parent's expectations and other people's standards. And when death swallows them up, they can say that they had truly lived an extraordinary life. They had seized the days."
ma-cortes,"Mar 8, 2022",7/10,"Splendid , agreeable and often emotive movie with wonderful acting and enjoyable scenes about the relationship between a teacher and his students . Robin Williams is super as the outlandish teacher who gave it all he had . An idealist English teacher (Robin Williams) inspires a septet of poetry students (Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles , Dylan Kussman , Ruggiero..) in a 1950s' prep school . He was their inspiration, he made their lives extraordinary , but unfortunately resulting in clashes with schools and parental authorities . As the offbeat teacher takes on the martinet headmaster (Norman LLoyd) who seeks to protect not the truth but the good name of the school . Indeed so extraordinary and incendiary are his his methods that you wonder how teacher and school ever accepted each other in the first place .A thoughtful and thought-provoking movie with interpretations uniformly good , in which a teacher teaches his pupils to pursue individuality and creative endeavor . Robin Williams shows he can master the comic as well as serious characters with this brooding portrayal of an unorthodox educator and his students . The film is pretty well , though undermined by a series of improbabilities and occasionally scripted with a heavy hand in order to elevate the message . The ensemble cast is magnificent with Robin Williams showcasing his considerable talents as an innovative and eccentric teacher arriving at an expensive and stuffy public school in Vermont and remaining cast : Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke , Josh Charles , Kustwood Smith, Alexandra Powers , Dylan Kussman , Allelon Ruggiero , Melora Walters, George Martin are top-notch. The story is narrated with sensitivity and intelligence and here are treated ethic and moral issues developed in great sense of ductility and fairness . The film is cleverly displayed throughout with enjoyable and sensitive style. The motion picture takes part of the School Sub-genre , being this prestigious ¨Dead Poets Society¨ (1989) by Peter Weir , its maxim representation along with ¨The emperor's club¨ (2002) Michael Hoffman and ¨Mona Lisa Smile¨ (2003) by Mike Newell .Adding Maurice Jarre's musical score is appealing and touching , though composed by synthesizer . Likewise , colorful and evocative cinematography by cameraman John Seale . The story was well and competently directed by Peter Weir . Famous for making well-known comedy and genre actors into credible dramatic actors such as Robin Williams , Harrison Ford, and Jim Carrey. Peter directed 5 different actors in Oscar-nominated performances: Linda Hunt, Harrison Ford, Robin Williams, Rosie Perez and Ed Harris. As of 2018, he has directed three Oscar Best Picture nominees: Witness (1985), Dead Poets Society(1989) and Master and Commander (2003), he was also nominated for Best Director for each film . His first succesful movie was ¨Gallipoli¨ that resulted to be the passport to Hollywood for this magnificent filmmaker . He realized numerous interesting stories superbly filmed , with brooding and thought-provoking issues and in his prestigious career deserves special attention the excellent film titled ¨Gallipoli¨ . Weir achieved several hits as ¨The way back¨, ¨Master and Commander¨, ¨Witness¨, ¨The Truman show¨ , ¨Dead poets society¨ , ¨The last wave¨ and some flops as ¨Mosquito coast¨ , ¨The plumber¨ . Rating ¨Dead Poets Society¨ (1989) : 7/10 . Better than average . The picture will appeal to Robin Williams fans . Well worth seeing ."

ninjawaiter,"Nov 17, 2024",8/10,"The Man Without a Face was apparently Mel Gibson's directorial debut in 1993, and established his pattern of directing and starring in his own films. It's based on a book of the same name, but I have not read it so I won't address that, only the film itself.I think the film is brilliant. The story is complex, the characters and their backgrounds and motivations deep and well-realized. They all feel like real people. The setting is wonderfully captured.The performances, even from the supporting cast, are outstanding, particularly where they require a fair bit from child actors, who even appear to be about the correct ages. Mel Gibson's performance is masterful, as usual, but so is the young Nick Stahl's.I watched this more than 30 years after the film's release, and it has lost nothing. The story and themes are timeless. The best comparison I could give this film is Dead Poets Society (1989), which is itself high praise, because that film was also fantastic. They both shine in different ways, but I suppose I'd have to admit I think DPS is probably the superior film, though not by much. If you liked DPS, you will almost certainly like this as well. Regardless, I very highly recommend this film."

julie5246,"Apr 12, 2001",N/A,"The movie Dead Poets Society was one of the best movies I have ever seen.. I was very impressed by many things from this movie. Especially Robin Williams,an English teacher, who taught his students the importance of ""seizing the day.""  It encourages me in many good ways in my life, just as it did the students. I strongly recommend to watch Dead Poets' Society.  I suggest this movie to those who think life is very ordinary and hopeless because it will change them each time they watch it."
bahae19,"Oct 29, 2025",7/10,"I just finished Dead Poets Society - it's a solid and emotional movie. I'd give it 7/10. The performances, especially from Robin Williams, were really good, but personally, I didn't feel like it had something very special or unique. Still, it's a meaningful film with a deep message about individuality and following your own path."
SudhitYadav74,"Jun 6, 2021",10/10,Dead Poets Society is a masterpiece in all aspects... Robin Williams and the young cast did a fantastic job... The acting and the screenplay is what that makes this movie so good.. The soundtrack is pretty good. Dead Poets Society is a life changing movie and everyone should watch this movie once before dying.
RustyShacklefordd,"Jan 8, 2017",7/10,"After hearing for years people talk how fantastic of a film this is (some would even say one of the best ever made) I finally decided to check it out. While it was enjoyable, it unfortunately failed to have the impact on me it has had on so many others.The biggest strength of the film is it's performances. Robin Williams is at it's best here showcasing not just his ability as a comedic actor, but also as a dramatic as well. His character is a fascinating one and anyone who has had a teacher or mentor who was inspiring will be able to relate to his character. What really surprised me though was how well the actors portraying the kids were. This is one of the few films I've seen that is focused intensely around a group of young adults were all of the actors do a great job.While the film has a good story at it's core, it hits so many of the same beats and themes as other coming-of-age films and stories that it pails in comparison to some of the better ones out there. The story takes a while to kick in as the film gets off to a rather slow start and while the actors do a great job, only one or two of the younger characters are actually interesting. Robin Williams really is the star here and when he disappears for too long the film begins to drag quite a bit. I honestly wish the movie had been focused on his character since he was the most interesting, but that's not the story this movie is trying to tell.For all my complaints, I still found Dead Poets Society to be an enjoyable film. It has fantastic performances, a good message, and features one of the most iconic (and well-deserving) best final scenes in a movie I've ever seen. But there's no denying that it pales in comparison to some other coming-of-age films due to a predictable story that drags in areas. I have a feeling many of the people who adore this film saw it when they were younger which is why it has stuck with them for so long which is perfectly fine, but anyone who has seen other coming-of-age films might find this one a bit underwhelming."
laciecondor,"Jul 7, 2008",10/10,"This is one of my all time faves.All the cast is excellentIn this film I laughed, I cried and I watched with anticipation.I have only seen this film five times but I am still waiting for it to be on again.I believe that Williams played an excellent role and it made me surprised how he could play a kind, funny and tearjearking role after parts in comedy. I also believe that Ethan played an excellent role to as the quite passive pupil. He played an exceptional duo with Williams and I hope to see more films like this as it really brought new light to my eyes of filmsWe need more films of this caliber out there."
LoveOfMine283,"Aug 28, 2008",10/10,"I know a lot of the people who gave this a low rating are teenagers who watched this in English class, but I was told by my English teacher to go out and watch this movie, and when I saw it on TV the other night, I started watching.This is, I can honestly say, one of the best movies I have ever seen in my short 15 years. It was beautifully done, and very inspiring to watch. I am so thankful for the recommendation. The plot was captivating, and I was completely mesmerized. I am a huge fan of the show House, and seeing Robert Sean Leonard in one of his earlier acting careers only made me love him more; his character was wonderfully portrayed. Robin Williams' character was equally great to watch.Someone advised teachers not to make their students watch this movie, and I think that that's a shame; but probably true. There are probably only like, four kids who will take the movie seriously and understand the depth of it, while the rest will sit around make jokes about it all day..."

John Keating a progressive English teacher gets appointed in strict 50s school and teaches the students about life in his unorthodox poetic way. He encourage his students to break free from the norm, go against the status quo and live life unapologetically
In John Keating's words Carpe Diem"
truemythmedia,"Nov 6, 2019",8/10,"Long before I had seen this film I knew of the most famous scene, that being the ""Oh, captain, my captain"" scene, and I've seen the phrase 'Carpe Diem' scribbled on whiteboards ever since I was a wee little lad in grade school. This film was ingrained in our culture before I entered the world (I know, I'm so young!), so I've never known a world without the ideas presented by so brilliantly and succinctly by John Keating (Robin Williams, ""The Fisher King""). If I had seen this film probably ten years ago, during the days of my youth when I was still searching for authors who could better put into words how I felt about the world, this film probably would've been a five star movie for me, but now, in the post-#Me Too era there are a few issues that come to light, and I also found there was a bit too much melodrama in the third act for my taste.As a whole however, this film is a wonderful work of art that has themes that I so agree with that I could sing about them from the top of a mountain. I've often quoted Franz Kafka on the TMM Podcast, specifically one of his more famous quotes, which is: ""A book must be an axe for the frozen sea inside us,"" meaning that good fiction should chip away at us, soften us, make us reconsider our own thoughts and ideas... I think that the same quote could be ascribed to films as well (or any art form, for that matter). Great films challenge me, and this film tries its darndest to do just that. I think this film that, thirty years after its release, just falls short of being Peter Weir's masterpiece (you just can't beat ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", in my opinion)."
kevjfarrell,"Aug 3, 2015",8/10,"Every school should have a teacher like Mr. Keating (Robin Williams). He is inspirational and teaches young men to think for themselves and look at life differently. If I'd had a teacher like that, I might have done better in school! For me, it's the theme of the story that is the most important. The acting performances are secondary. I've watched the movie about three times now, and I still find myself getting inspired - and getting a boost to my self confidence! Robin Williams is excellent in this type of role - in my opinion, I prefer his performances in drama rather than comedy.This movie should be shown in all schools for 12-13 year olds. It's especially motivating for those who may lack confidence and are somewhat meek and mild. This movie gives them a voice. A teacher like Mr. Keating shapes the lives of young men and teaches them more than any classroom book can. It's a life affirming movie. I love the movie!"
Dime,"Jul 21, 1999",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is the best movie I have ever seen of the drama kind,it has everything to make an excellent movie. Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke and all the guys play an excellent role. The movie makes you think about life and what we lost when we're under so many rules and repression."
melania-chaves03,"Jun 1, 2013",N/A,"""Carpe Diem"": Seize the day. This is the lesson, John Keating, the English schoolteacher wants to convey to his students. This movie is one of the best movies I've ever watched. It helps people to face problems and live life as if there was no tomorrow. It teaches us how to enjoy every aspect of life and let nothing ruin what makes us really happy. It is not only entertaining, but it teaches a great life lesson, which is to think for ourselves and stand up for that in which we believe. It is incomparable with other movies and should definitely be watched by everyone. Dead Poets Society was nominated for four Academy Awards. It is from the genre of drama and although it is a 1989 movie, the picture is great and the movie is so stimulating and outstanding, the picture won't even be a problem.The movie takes place in 1959 in the Welton Academy. In this school education is very strict and students are expected to behave in a highly educated and responsible manner. Several of the students have a different opinion regarding the school's education process. When the new teacher comes, everything changes. John Keating is an unconventional teacher who tells his students to tear out the pages of the books and asks his students to stand on their desks to see the world from a different perspective. He introduces the boys to poetry and teaches them new philosophies about life. He encourages his students to follow their dreams, and to not follow what people expect them to do, but what makes them happy.The characters in this film are so realistic; they create an impact in the audience. I hate movies with flat characters and in this movie the character development is really outstanding. Robin Williams plays an excellent job as the professor and interacts very well with the students. In his early life, Williams studied political science before studying theatre in the Julliard School. He later on performed in nightclubs where he was discovered for the role of Mork on the TV series ""Happy Days"". Another important character is Robert Leonard who plays the role of Neil Perry. He deserves acknowledgment and fame and is mostly known as Dr. James Wilson on House M.D. Ethan Hawke is another important character in the movie. He plays the role of Todd Anderson in the movie. Ethan was born on 6 November 1970 in Austin Texas. His acting career started as a mix of theatre work and a mix of serious and commercial movies. All of these actors play an excellent role in the movie. They create an exciting plot, and the move builds up perfectly.At first the movie seemed kind of boring, but as I paid more attention and it advanced it was amazing. It tells a story that nobody should miss. I talks about courage, how we should fight for what we want, and to live life to the fullest. One of my favorite scenes was when the English teacher, Mr. Keating, tells the students to tear the pages of a book apart. In every scene he is an excellent teacher, he makes the class entertaining and the students learn more than you could imagine. They do not only learn about English and poetry, but they learn about life.This movie is heartwarming; it has a full meaning, and is contains great poetry that has life lessons. I believe the most important lesson in this movie is to seize the day. This means to make out the most of each day, as if we would die tomorrow. This relates to doing what you like, what you enjoy the most in life. It is getting apart from what society expects from you, and doing what makes you happy. Another important lesson is to be you. We live in a society in which everyone expects something from you, but the most important thing is to be your own self. It will help in mental and spiritual growth. Challenging the status quo is another lesson. Change the way to see life, make a change in the world, in people. One last lesson is to stand up for others. This will not only be beneficial for the people you help but it will help you feel better.I believe everyone who watches the movie should enjoy it. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to watch it but especially for people above 13 years. This is because someone younger than this will maybe not understand well the meaning of the movie and will think it is boring. I would rate the movie PG-13.This movie is as great as the Oscar Winning movie ""The Help"". Both movies are delightfully different. In ""The Help"", as well as in ""Dead Poets Society"", the characters play an excellent role and the plot is entertaining and fun. Along the movie you will not get bored, it catches the audience's attention due to the fact that they treat interesting subjects. They are memorable movies, that once you watch them you will never forget the lesson and it will change your life. Both teach a wonderful lesson that everyone should take into account in their daily lives.Rating 8.7The criticizer of this movie is Melania Chaves. She is an eleventh grade student at Lincoln School, Costa Rica. She is seventeen years old and will graduate next year from high school. She enjoys watching movies and hanging out with her friends. Her hobbies are playing tennis, running, and playing piano.Carpe Diem!"
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jul 8, 2020",7/10,"Set in an all boys boarding school, 'Dead Poets Society (1989)' explores what it means to think for yourself in a society that seems to value conformity above all else. With a subtle performance from Robin Williams and equally as down-to-earth turns by its young cast (which includes a fresh-faced Ethan Hawke), the picture crafts a gentle, grounded and emotive experience that achieves its desired effect. The first act is a little slow, as the flick sets up its central concept and characters, and it takes a while for the thing to start affecting as it should, but the overall result is entertaining and, when it needs to be, rather powerful. It takes you through a bevy of emotions and certainly makes its point. It's quite unique, in a way. It mightn't be the most outwardly enjoyable picture, but it's an engaging effort. 7/10"
AKapeJC,"Dec 3, 2009",10/10,"Without a doubt, this is my favorite film of all time! No other film has inspired me, challenged me, or changed me as much as this film! It takes a simple idea of making the most out of everyday and expands it to the nth degree, all the while reaching across to audiences of many kinds, from film critics to moviegoers to high school students to even Academy members! It talks about seizing the day, your life, and getting the most out of it, which is what you would expect. But it delves much deeper, revealing the challenges of seizing your life, especially growing up, the pressure on how you should live and on how you should follow, and the potential consequences of doing so. Yet at the same time, it shows you the benefits and how those benefits greatly outweigh those negative traits. And it does so in such an intriguing way. Each kid is different and well-developed yet all have some similarity. Robin Williams plays an amazing role as Mr. Keating (I always saw him as a more talented dramatic actor than a comedic one). Some have said that the story is unrealistic and a rehash of other student- teacher movies. But like the poetry in this movie, this is not about realism, this is about the message of seizing the day and making your world extraordinary. The way the movie does this is so unforgettable with the believable and grade-A acting from the students and Williams, the great camera shots, and the amazing theme and atmosphere, so much so that I can watch the entire movie just for those select scenes. All of this and more is why Dead Poets Society is my number 1 favorite movie of all time!"
piksplanet,"Jul 5, 2008",7/10,"Dead Poets Society is not a film for everyone. For people who delve too deep into the meaning of the film, you might find yourself rather cheated or disappointed because of its radical nature. However, if you take it for what it is.. A film that wants to incite the senses to accept change; you will end up getting that warm feeling one gets when having a cup of hot chocolate on a chilly December morning. It works itself up from a simple saying ~ Carpe diem, which is Latin for 'Seize the day'. It is what the new English teacher asks his new 17 year old batch of students to do (in quite a bizarre manner). Together with The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it is one of Peter Weir's best films. The football match with Beethoven in the background, and the climax with bagpipes are the two best sequences in the film. I found Robin Williams' impersonation of Marlon Brando and John Wayne hilarious! Dead Poets Society is a film that has been widely criticized for its ending. You will know why once you've see it. As far as film-making goes, the ending is done perfectly. However, it could mean different things to different people. To challenge your views, to look at things differently, give Dead Poets Society a go. It is based in 1959, so don't give it as hard a time as some critics have given it.O Captain! My Captain! 7/10. I love the ending."
davidmvining,"Aug 18, 2023",5/10,"This is one of those films that just passes me by. I don't get it. I look at the effusive praise in a host of reviews, its high ratings everywhere, and the host of Oscar nominations, and I just don't understand the praise. The script is a confused mess without any real focus while taking this mushy-headed view of nonconformism that doesn't hold up to much scrutiny. Watching this in the context of Peter Weir's body of work, it's weird how the unorthodox and inspiring teacher shares so many qualities with the insane madman that centered The Mosquito Coast, telling me that something was lost between when Weir started the film and where he ended it. But that so many people see it as some sort of inspiring piece of drama just eludes me completely.Welton Academy is a preparatory school with a hundred years of history and strict rules about what is to be learned and how. The senior class is highlighted by a cadre of friends led by Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), joined by a new addition to the school, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke). Neil is the son of an overbearing father (Kurtwood Smith) who dictates every class and every extracurricular activity Neil takes. Todd is withdrawn and a bit out of place. Into their lives comes Mr. Keating (Robin Williams), a former graduate of Welton who is their new poetry teacher.Keating is the center focus of the film from the outside, but he's actually a surprisingly small part of the film. He's very much a supporting player, and Robin Williams as Keating is probably my favorite part of the film. I get his appeal in general, and his dismissal of the ""Pritchard Scale"", an invented model for analyzing poetry loosely based on the work of a real academic, Laurence Perrine, that reduces the mysteries of art into a mathematical equation, is kind of infectious. Art is an exploration of humanity, not a trigonometry problem, and Keating exposing the wonderful world of art to boys who are living very structured lives is very rewarding.However, the film simply stops creating any sort of comparison. It becomes all about the ""artful life"" without connection to anything else, with only the occasional sop to the more structured learnings of things like chemistry, mathematics, and physics. This is where the film becomes all tell not show regarding its central point, and it suffers greatly for it.Another issue I have with the film is that its an ensemble piece about six boys at this school when there's an obvious focus in Neil. Instead, we get extended bits about Knox (Josh Charles) trying to woo a local girl that comes to no real conclusion and a couple of other minor subplots that amount to no more than a venial reading of the venial phrase Carpe Diem which seems to imply that the boys should just spend all of their time at this high-paying prep school smoking cigarettes in an old Indian cave and chasing girls. Now, I was a young man once, and I understand the great appeal of a teacher telling you that all that matters in life is poetry and girls and romance, but it's a short-sighted, venial look on life, not a deeply insightful or meaningful one, especially when it's not counterbalanced by a life of work. When you're working all the time to create something, taking a moment to seize the day means something. Seizing the day everyday leads to creating nothing.And this is where my earlier point about the film being tell not show comes into play. We get one line late about how Neil has all A's in his classes, but we haven't seen him in one of those classes since about the ten minute mark in the film. We haven't seen him balancing his seizing the day with his hard work. It's all been seizing the day, and it creates this dramatic impression that he's a venial, unserious person who is abandoning everything to start acting. And you can see why wannabe artists would love this film. The actual dramatic focus is about how nothing matters but art, telling them to abandon everything in pursuit of your dreams of being an artist. It's unrealistic and a pathway for 99% of the people who take the advice to waste their earlier years in pursuit of a goal they cannot reach.Now, I don't think that was what the script by Tom Schulman was trying to do: it was just too inept to actually accomplish what it wanted. He wanted the focus to be on this fictionalized version of a teacher he had in prep school that he loved, and it becomes this ode to him (the excised elements that Peter Weir got rid of about Keating's terminal illness makes that even more obvious), but it denies the central characters of the proper framing for their views. That is supposed to be handled by Neil's father's overbearing nature, but that is also undermined by the fact that Neil isn't the main character.It's weird to sit here decades later about a film everyone loves and insist it needs a ground up rewrite, but I think it does. Make Neil the protagonist, but also make Todd the point of view character. Neil guides Todd through the student side of Welton, which includes a heavy emphasis on the more rigorous academic side, while Keating gets them to try and balance that out with his teaching on poetry. That balance is necessary for the point to work, maybe creating a counterpoint between the two boys as Neil gets more into Keating's side of things while Todd tries to keep things more firmly in the harder sciences, creating a contrast in how they approach life. You can keep the ending as it is, though I'll note that having a young man take such drastic actions because his daddy says he can't act anymore is a sign of deep mental illness. That's another reason I want more focus on Neil instead of the stuff about Knox trying to get laid.I'll also note that the underlying point of nonconformism feels hollow since the manifestation of nonconformism here isn't really nonconformism, it's conformism to a new conformity. This is where the comparison between Keating and Allie Fox in The Mosquito Coast becomes the most apparent to me: they were both trying to create new utopias in established orders, and both led to disaster. The idea that Keating is a hero in Weir's mind while Fox was a monster doesn't hold water to me, and there's the moment late in the film where Keating seems to take personal, private blame for the tragedy that ends the film, like he held himself responsible for what had happened on some level, not that he viewed himself as a misunderstood hero who did nothing wrong, unlike the boys at the end.Really, this movie is confused, and I really don't see how anyone thinks it holds up to serious scrutiny. Walking away with ""seize the day"" and nothing else feels simple-minded, but that's kind of what happens with the script as it currently sits. That it won a Best Screenplay Oscar is honestly an embarrassment.Weir, though, brings his practiced professionalism to the production. His careful eye and strong relationship with actors gets great performances from everyone, so everyone is doing everything they can to make the most of this script. Weir was simply too talented to produce a disaster of a film, but he did make the most he could of a disaster of a script."
scatter_brained4,"Apr 20, 2010",10/10,"I just saw this movie in my band class because of testing and I can't believe I never heard of it before. This film has a great cast and right. People shouldn't have to go along with everybody if they have different dreams of their own. Neil, one the Free Thinker at school but Follower and home, wanted to become an actor but his jealous and controlling father gave him no other option. Todd, my favorite and a Fencer, isn't sure whether he wants to go along with what everybody is doing instead of following his heart and he is jealous of his friend Neil because he has trouble speaking in front of people and has a low self esteem. Yes, Cameron is a Follower who goes by the rules no matter what. The ruler he used to tear off the pages of his book is an example that he only goes by the rules and never bends them only if someone asks him to. Mr. Keening is my favorite character because he interacts with his students in such an effective way that gets them interested in the class. And the comments he says sometimes are just plain hilarious. I just like the overall message about Siezing the Day and that we are all worm food so why live our life according to how others want us to live them? We all like different passions and dislikes and shouldn't feel afraid to get out of our little fence of protection, safety, isolation, fear, or security. We must come out of our comfort zones to fully live. Being Alive is not just breathing and moving, it's living for what we believe in and acting on those beliefs accordingly. That is when we will truly make a difference."
evangelia_tripoliti,"Jul 28, 2019",9/10,"I recently saw the movie. Its meaning is still timeless, and produces strong emotions. Follow your dreams, passions, and, goals, be ambitious, keep trying and never stop believing in pure values and standards. It means a lot to have someone in your life to teach you this valuable lesson. For me it was a professor as well. So the movie did affect me a lot.It's sad though that it still captures today's society. Things haven't really changed. The necessity of expressing feelings is of high importance and can affect one's life. People still can't talk to their parents and seek mentors and advisors elsewhere, but the void is never filled. The educational system hasn't changed either. Education is more than just doing maths and physics. It's about creating character, find yourself and developing ideas. That's why students fadmire professors like Keating. They become more like mentors and their words stay with you forever.Great movie, teaches valueble lessons."
rjames-636-758030,"Mar 18, 2013",10/10,"This movie came out during my second year of University. Although I was a business major, the Carpe Diem theme resonated so strongly with me that it has shaped my life. I am not sure Dead Poets would have the same impact if I saw it at any other time in my life, but my identification with the main characters (group of young men living in a dorm) drew me into the movie. After watching this movie, I had an unquenchable thirst for Emerson, Thoreau (Walden is amazing) and the other Transcendentalists. This is more than a movie - it is a philosophy that can shape a very meaningful life. I watch Dead Poets Society every so often to reconnect with the younger version of myself - when possibilities were limitless and youthful idealism governed my actions.I am in my early 40's now and am passing on the Carpe Diem message to my 3 daughters."
Catherine_Grace_Zeh,"Nov 22, 2005",9/10,"DEAD POETS SOCIETY, in my opinion, is an excellent Robin Williams film. Despite the fact that Keating (Robin Williams) was funny, his antics were a little unorthodox. The first time I ever saw this was in English class during my senior year of high school. After seeing it then, I decided I liked it. However, I didn't buy it on VHS until a year or so later. If you ask me, the most memorable quote is, ""Carpe Diem!"" In case you're wondering, that's a Latin phrase. Before I wrap this up, I must say that the performances were top grade. Now, in conclusion, if you are a fan of Robin Williams or Ethan Hawke, you're in for a good time and lots of laughs, so see this movie today."
CraziiHuskie,"Oct 30, 2005",10/10,"This movie is a must see! Great movie about a group of boys who find their true inner-selves in the mist of an upper-class school. Robin Williams really pulls this part off as a teacher who helps guide the boys to what will forever be something they will cherish the rest of their lives. I have to say that this movie really taught myself a few life lessons with, ""suck the marrow out of life."" The ending really leaves a mark on your heart and a tear in your eye. If you love movies that keep you thinking and at the edge of your seat yet entertaining at the same time, this is the movie for you. This movie really does teach many life lessons that people of all ages should learn."
Irascible_Xenos,"May 26, 2020",N/A,"One of the few films I would like to watch over and over again and it was a tumultuous experience to me. This movie perfectly portrayed modern vision of our society. Always follow your instinct, show you who you are, prove it with passion, courage. Life is a race if you halt, people will leap forward you. But what's the point of leading a race when you can't suck the marrow out of your life. Robin Williams always wished to be a teacher like this in his school life and he didn't let down. This journey felt like the true visual representation of Dead Poets Society!"
Hitchcoc,"Mar 31, 2018",7/10,"Having taught English for 43 years, I have stood in the place Robin William's character has. Some days you look out over the herds of kids that pass before you and you cry for them. As a teacher who put his heart and soul into what I did, I tried to make impressions help them master life skills. The sad reality is that one does one's best to crack the numbers game. Every year we have a few of those students who we try to embrace and find the right direction for them, but we are so hamstrung. The first thing I thought when evaluating this film is the little group of kids that he dealt with. He got to know each of them intimately. Of course, it's a prep school, but even then he should have had a couple other full classrooms. What he does is admirable and exciting. That he throws himself into his work to such an extent is amazing. But let's face it. This is a formulaic film that has been done many times before. It is monument building and flying in the face of establishment whose soul purpose is to ruin these kids' lives. There's a kind of narcissism to think that in this group we have bunch of directionless idiots who could never think for themselves. It sends a positive message but the population is carefully put together to send that message. It's just not real."

Big-Bad-Barry,"Jun 14, 2023",6/10,"I re-watched this film 25 years after my first viewing chiefly to the look of horror on friends faces when I told them I didn't enjoy it.Sure, from the perspective of a 15 year old, it was a little light on violence, nudity and car chases. I was also cajoled in to watching it by an English teacher. These could be two reasons for my negative reminiscence of the film.Whilst I was able to appreciate the storyline more as a fully grown adult, and appreciate the performance of Robin Williams, I was still unable to understand why everyone I know thinks that this is one of their greatest films.It's a good film. But I wouldn't rave about it."
zetes,"Feb 17, 2014",5/10,"The only Best Picture nominee from 1989 that I hadn't yet seen. It was a real bad year for the Oscars, I think. Of the five, I like Born on the Fourth of July a lot. Or at least I used to like it. I haven't seen it in years and I'm not sure it would hold up that well. The other four are quite mediocre, with one of the most mediocre winners of all time, Driving Miss Daisy. If you can extrapolate the general IMDb voter's opinion, Dead Poets Society should have won. It's the highest rated of the five, and has about 140,000 more votes than the next most voted on title. That's pretty amazing, really. I don't get it, frankly. Dead Poets Society to me was probably the worst of the five, just complete sludge. The film is about a group of rich white boys at a boarding school who become enamored of their free-spirited teacher, Robin Williams, who teaches them to ""carpe diem,"" or ""sieze the day."" The boys (who include Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard) form the Dead Poets Society, where they meet at night in a cave to read poetry. This is, for no reason in particular, highly looked down upon. And woe unto you if you ever want to act in a Shakespeare play, as Leonard eventually does. His father, Kurtwood Smith, does not approve of such frivolities. The final act of this film is pretty ridiculous, with Robin Williams incurring blame for something that clearly had nothing to do with him. The ending, which is supposed to be uplifting, just feels extremely unsatisfying. The performances are actually quite fine. Williams certainly didn't deserve a Best Actor nomination, though. This is clearly category fraud. There is no clear lead, but both Leonard and Hawke probably have more screen time than Williams, who seems like he's barely in the film for it being such a well loved performance."
Ampero,"Jan 25, 2010",8/10,"This movie, for one, is a real gem of character fruition. Set in the fictional Welton (Hell-ton) Academy for Boys we follow a few of its students and a new English teacher, Mr. Keating. One of the main themes, as propelled by Mr. Keating to the boys, is to grasp life as it is and not as it's expected and he does that through embedding an appreciation for poetry and the literary arts- not as mere text to adhere and memorize but as emotions and stories to feel. Through that Mr. Keating allowed the boys to get to know themselves and find where their passion lies, aside from what is expected of their future.One of the main characters, Neil Perry, may have been the most influenced by this new perspective being taught and goes about to form a bastard version of the Dead Poets Society upon learning of it from Mr. Keating's past as a former student of Welton. This ushers in a flurry of self-discovery and adolescent rebellion as the boys find themselves building an appreciation for the arts and self-expression.The villain of the movie lay with the school officials and some parents garnering the uppity appeal of authority and the 'right way' of things. The inevitable struggle with that and the boys was an awesome display of humanity as the Dead Poets Society is inevitably dismantled because of a tragic resolution of one of the characters. The process showed how selfish people can be in the face of doing the right thing as opposed to not getting chided for your own beliefs. The way it reflected how society conditions and discourages free-thinking is awesome, especially when the caged-bird syndrome is revealed with Neil Perry.The acting in this movie, considering the ages of the characters was great. All the little nuances that you would expect from a group of teenage boys were there and they were, surprisingly, tolerable. We got to see a young Ethan Hawke, as Todd Anderson, flap his acting wings as the film's strong under-dog supporting character. The direction was great as well. The mood and the overall growth of the film was enough to put you into the world and root for the characters while not being too demanding or too taxing on the viewer. Robin Williams excelled in the dramatics of his role and it was a breath of fresh air to see him go to his comedic panache in the few moments that he did. Being a teen movie one would expect some elements of a love scene and it was there but not in the overwhelming sense for it to take away from the film, it merely supplemented the appreciation for passion and seizing the day – as was the general theme of the movie.It's indeed a classic in its own right and one that should be watched at least once to make your life extraordinary. The life lessons scattered throughout will leave you feeling, somewhat, appreciative of the little things and will leave you chanting Carpe Diem or referring to a friend as 'Captain, My Captain.'Standout Line: ""We don't read & write poetry because it's cute. We read & write poetry because we're human beings and we're filled with passion!"""
kyle-cruse,"Sep 17, 2008",8/10,"I generally find great inspiration in films like this, and ""Dead Poets Society"" is no exception. Robin Williams stars as a professor who encourages his students to ""make your lives extraordinary."" This ends up causing some of the students to go too far in this direction, resulting in the ""sad"" elements of this film. I did, however, feel a sense of encouragement in what Williams says, realizing that we've only got one life in this world and should make it something great. The scenes with Williams are superb, some of the best dialogue you will ever hear, in this film that won an Oscar for its screenplay. Williams was robbed of an Oscar here, though he later won one for the similar film he appeared in ""Good Will Hunting."" Though I like ""Good Will Hunting"" even better, I truly enjoyed this film. The one thing I felt it lacked was enough scenes with Williams and his students. Too many scenes feature the students off on their own in their club, or getting in trouble with other students or their parents, scenes that can get depressing when there are so many of them. Fortunately, Robin Williams comes around often enough the lighten things up a bit, though this is considered one of the first of his more serious roles. The ending scene is great, as is the one with Williams telling the students to rip out part of their textbook. A nicely-done, inspiring film. Not perfect, though it is still quite good.***1/2 out of ****"

sokena22,"Dec 10, 2024",8/10,"Undoubtedly one of my favorits movies. It's an incredibly thought-provoking movie, especially for those who yearn for something deeper in life. Few movies capture the essence of poetry as powerfully as this one. It leaves you with profound reflections and an irresistible urge to think freely and challenge societal norms.It also addresses the tragedy of living according to others' expectations and the heartbreak that comes from letting someone else dictate your dreams. This part adds to its emotional depth and overall greatness.Lastly, I can't imagine a more fitting actor for the role of Mr. Keating than Robin Williams. His performance is extraordinary, such a brilliant actor that leaves you with a warmth within.Couldn't help but shed tears at the ending."
bob the moo,"Jul 11, 2004",N/A,"In an exclusive prep school in the 1950's, the focus is on grades and learning as sons follow their fathers' footsteps into the family profession.However, for a group of friends this changes when a new English teacher starts. As Mr Keating teaches them to express themselves and free their souls, the boys form a club for the reading of poetry and the discovery of beauty. However against an uptight background, tensions are formed and the boys learn more than they had expected.With my mother wishing to watch this film, I decided to stick around and give it a try as well, even though I had seen it before when it had come out. True to my memory the film is a quite sentimental coming of age story that does pretty much what you expect but feels quite classy. The story isn't overly moving but some scenes pull on the heart, albeit in a rather cynical 'swelling music' way. However, it does work even if I don't think the Oscar praise was totally deserving  if pushed I would say it was one of the better 'coming of age' things I'd seen recently.The cast are all pretty good and have mostly become more famous with time. Williams is his usual sappy self but tones it down a little here. Considering that his role is really just a supporting one, a catalyst for the boys' story, Williams manages to make a big impression with key scenes. I'm not a big fan of his but he gives a well-delivered performance here. Leonard and Hawke are both pretty strong even if it is hard to see them as young boys now  I can't help but see them as they are now. Support is good from Smith, Charles, Hansen etc but really the film belongs to Hawke and Leonard unless Williams is swinging in to steal his individual scenes from them.Very much a mothers' film this one  if you like the weepy, sentimental genre then you should love this. To be honest it is not really my cup of tea but I did quite enjoy it and felt the writing was pretty good  just a shame that it is never more than a crying boy away from slipping into bonding and sentimentality. A little syrupy and will put off those who dislike such things but fans of the genre will love it and will leave it buoyed up by the message of 'carpe diem'."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Mar 23, 2007",6/10,"Some films simply don't seem to leave much of an impression; they don't stand out and they don't inspire in-jokes and references to its audience. This film may have tried, but it just really didn't do much for this particular viewer. The plot is good, and the story is one that should be told. The way it's told here works OK, but the film never grabbed me. I never stopped watching or particularly felt like it... the film isn't bad, just somewhat bland. The acting ranges, but is rarely magnificent. The cast has a nice hand-full of people who have done better, given much more convincing performances. The writing ranges. There are a few scenes that work well, maybe even one or two that are downright memorable and good, but then there are the(admittedly only few) underdeveloped sub-plots, and scenes that just don't come off as dramatic as it seems like they were meant to. There are a few technical issues; the editing is at times strange, cutting away or on to the next shot too soon or too late. The cinematography mostly at least works, but there are a few shots that are oddly framed. In the end, this is a decent enough film, it just seems like it could have been considerably better, given the people in front of and behind the cameras(Weir went on to direct The Truman Show). I recommend it to fans of the people involved in making it as well as anyone the plot appeals to. I hope you enjoy it more than I did. 6/10"

st-shot,"Oct 14, 2011",6/10,"This cloyingly overlong prep school based drama about a teacher thinking outside the box in 50s America and a mix of conflicted dullards he influenced to literally new heights with tragic consequence seems to meander more than build. When it finally does at nearly two hours grasp some intensity it does so by a quick fix deus ex machina.Newly arrived John Keating ( Robin Williams) roars into his first year at the staid Welton Academy with some unorthodox ideas. A former student himself he encourages the lads to reform the Dead Poet's Society and seize the day. It all seems rather odd that having gone to the school and understood its highly conservative motto he might take it kind of slow in his first year but hey, no one's gonna get in the way of Robin doing his routine.Williams is mawkishly idealistic, less zany more zen. Only he could commit an act of Fascist book burning and make it seem nobly liberating. His students are more or less relegated to looking upon him in awe addressing him in hushed tones. Norman Lloyd as the headmaster chews up more than one desk.Peter Weir's direction lingers rather than soar and the film never achieves much trajectory, just plods in mostly morose adolescent funk. John Searles cinematography is town and country and Maurice Jarrre's music score flush with pompous importance. Dead Poet's Society may not be dead on arrival but it's in critical condition most of the way."
pderocco,"Sep 6, 2007",2/10,"It amazes me how easily people fall for cardboard characters. In real life, it would be impossible to find an educational institution so filled with boorish, vile teachers, and wimpish, intimidated students, with the exception of this one dazzling, inspiring professor. Real life doesn't work that way--no one is as perfect, or perfectly awful, as these people.But that's not the point. The point is to set up superficial symbols of the prejudices of the audience (the stuffy conservative teachers, the heartlessly strict father, the violent jock), and knock them down with a feather, so that the audience can congratulate itself for its enlightened attitudes.This is about what I'd expect from Robin Williams, who usually seems to gravitate to roles of this sort. However, other worthy actors fell into this trap, I hope only because a job's a job. Kurtwood Smith is known for playing another tough-guy father, but in ""That 70s Show"" he's a complex character. There, he's always threatening to ""kick ass"", but he's also capable of humor and love; here, he's a pathetic cartoon. But Robin Williams is also a cartoon, just of the opposite kind, a paragon of humanity who can do no wrong, but whom everyone but his rapt students believe is the devil.How can they write stuff like this? Is this what passes for creativity in Hollywood? I watched this on TCM immediately after the old ""Goodbye Mr. Chips"", and as angelic as the characters in that were, they at least seemed like real people. This script is as manipulative in its own way as ""Death Wish"", trying to provoke the same level of rage toward the symbols of a hated culture. It makes sense when the target is the culture of thuggish gangs who rape and murder, but of prep schools? What's so awful about prep schools? I went to one of the top schools, and believe me, it was a heck of a lot more inspiring than public school. This movie is insulting junk."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Sep 30, 2009",10/10,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a maturing into adulthood drama whose story and messages are as instructional as they are inspiring. The film is like an inspirational teacher, the one in high school that changed the way you thought about life and knowledge. It reflects this in Mr. Keating, the teacher who touched the lives of a group of teenage boys for the better despite the monstrous obstacle of conformity in all their paths.Directed by Peter Weir (""Gallipoli"") and written beautifully by Tom Schulman, ""Dead Poets Society"" stars Robin Williams in one his first great dramatic performances as Keating, an English teacher at an all-boys boarding school who inspires his students with poetry and by encourages their own free thinking with the simple motto of ""carpe diem (seize the day).""But the film is really about the boys and their various struggles. Todd (Ethan Hawke) is quiet and keeps to himself -- he's scared of personal expression. Neil (Robert Sean Leonard) is living in the iron grip of his father (Kurtwood Smith) who insists he become a doctor when his passion is really acting. Knox (Josh Charles) discovers infatuation/love and the courage it requires and Charlie deals the barriers of free speech. Keating's lessons inspire their actions and bring out new parts of themselves and together they hold Dead Poets Society meetings in a cave in the woods.The clique of rebellious teenage boys and their unusual teacher are not motifs foreign to film, and neither are themes of fighting conformity and making the most of life. Most adults know all about these ideas -- they're not exactly profound and original -- but Tom Schulman tells ""Dead Poets Society"" in such a way that allows you to rediscover them and reawaken memories of what that personal experience was like. We see the rigid culture and system of the school and the classroom and then suddenly Keating comes in and makes learning what it should be. Suddenly we remember who our ""Keatings"" were and what it was like when we finally learned the value of our own perspectives, ideas and most importantly, desires.The cast of young men is excellent. They make sure no character entirely falls into a teenage stereotype despite their many personalities that make up the group dynamic. We remember our own youthful enthusiasm through their experience and empathize with their troubles.Weir's direction leads us gracefully into this rediscovery. His use of symbolism and the subtle ways he re-implants elements of the classroom scenes into the students' subplots and other key moments of the film draw us back to the power of the learning experience and how it can leave such a fine imprint on our lives. We see clearly how those scenes with Keating give life to the rest of the story and rekindle our memories and ignite our emotions as we connect to the characters and their experiences.""Dead Poets Society"" is a great execution of a simple inspirational drama/tragedy. Despite having all the elements, it avoids cliché much of the time or at least masks it with the strong connection the story builds with its audience. Many films have been more dramatic or original, but this film really gets the most out of what it is and tells a story about something universally human to which every soul with even the slightest meaningful education experience can relate. ~Steven CVisit my site at http://moviemusereviews.blogspot.com"
Biggles-7,"Jan 3, 2001",10/10,"I was told before going to see Dead Poet's Society that it could be quite an emotional film with many saying that they cried as they watched it.So I went and watched. Some very emotional stuff, but I never felt close to tears...Until the end. The final scene of the film is truly, truly wonderful and I have honestly never heard a cinema audience weep so openly as I did on that occasion.It was a perfect ending. It didn't need anything more. You didn't need to know what happened to Keating. You didn't need to know what happened to the boys. Everything was summed up in the few words put over in the scene and Williams' final ""Thank you, Boys""."
Elias Riman,"Jul 22, 1999",10/10,"This extraordinary movie, with excelent cinematography, is one of my favorites. The inspiring story about a revolutionary teacher in the early sixties, who take his students into the world of thinking, instead of the world of memorizing rules. The truth shall make you free. Carpe Diem, Seize the day, the phrase that became popular with this movie. Carpe Diem, a latin phrase which means to live our days as if they were the last ones, living fully, plenty of joy. Looking for our dreams and get them, it does not matter what the world says, if we want them, we will achieve them.  Carpe Diem.Elías III"

It is truly poetry on the screen.. a great story and a touching social commentary on humanity and life's greatest challenges. The thought of non conformity scares a lot of people in this world but when you choose to take a step out of the box your life will forever be changed.

Manassvim,"May 23, 2025",10/10,"My comfort movie. My cry-every-time movie. My 10 on 10 movie.Some movies entertain.Some movies pass the time.But Dead Poets Society?It becomes a part of you.This film is my comfort movie. The kind I return to when I need to feel something real. It's the one that makes me cry every single time, even though I know exactly what's coming. It's not about the ending-it's about the feeling. The truth in it. The fire.The dialogues in this movie? Every single word felt like it was written for my soul.Not a line wasted.Not a moment hollowed.I've written every quote in my journal. Memorized them. Whispered them to myself in silence. Posters on my wallFrom the very popular:
""Gather ye rosebuds while ye may.""
""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.""
To the hauntingly beautiful poem read by Todd Anderson.And the moment he finds his voice:
""I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world!""Every table-stand was a shift in perspective.Every whisper of ""O Captain, my Captain"" was a war cry for freedom.This movie made me fall deeper in love with Walt Whitman-a man whose poetry now lives inside me because of this film.And that opening line... that secret, sacred entry to the Dead Poets Society:
""I went to the woods because I wished to live deliberately,
to front only the essential facts of life and see if I could not learn what it had to teach,
and not, when I came to die, discover that I had not lived.""Or the poem that reminds us:
""We gotta be more. We gotta do more.""OR my absolute favorite and most inspirational line -
""What will your verse be?""
That line. That one line breaks me open every time.This movie is more than motivational.It's transformational.And the lesson? It's different for everyone.You take from it what your heart needs most.I loved, loved, loved this movie for its dialogues. For its spirit. For its belief in words.This isn't just cinema-it's poetry wrapped in pain, friendship, rebellion, and truth.From now on, instead of saying ""I promise"" or ""My word"",
I'll start saying:""Dead Poets' Honor."""
Chrysanthepop,"Dec 18, 2008",N/A,"Unlike others, I fail to see why this is an excellent film. Perhaps it's to do with my age as the film seems to have affected teenagers most (yet I still love 'Catcher in the Rye', 'Heathers', 'Back To The Future' etc). To me, 'Dead Poet's Society' is by no means a terrible film and I appreciate the effort director Peter Weir put into it. Even though I found it to be dull (due to the slow pace), by the time I am slipping away into boredom, a great scene appears right at that moment to bring me 'back to life' and so it continues until the end. What I liked most about this movie are the performances. Norman Lloyd is convincing as the hateful principal. Robin Williams is brilliant but it is the then newcomers, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard and Gale Hansen who own the movie and hold more than their own opposite the more experienced actors. I enjoyed the scenes of camaraderie and loyalty that existed among the friends. The background score is another plus. I particularly liked how Mike Oldfield's track was utilised. Moreover, there are some very nice visuals, the most powerful one being the scene covered field where Ethan Hawke runs into whiteness, mourning his friend's death. Overall, even though I may not include this among my favourite movies, it's still very watchable."
Rob_Mck32,"Aug 23, 2025",10/10,"Robin Williams, just wow. His performance as John Keating could be the most referenced performance in a movie ever across pop culture since it's come out. I didn't even get those references until I watched it!It was so intelligent and emotional but the ending was so sad and so good, I completely get why so many people love it."
tobyindia,"Feb 11, 2002",6/10,"""To Sir, with Love"" it is not! Dont expect the world, and maybe..just maybe you wont be disappointed. Maurice Jarre's (Dr.Zhivago) compositions are top notch as always. Ethan Hawke, Robin Williams et al have put in fine performances, but it isn't enough to make this a gripping tale.It is (story line) pretty loose-ended and flimsy. And the ending isnt great either. It is in fact an anti climax! The high ratings for this film are unfounded. Mass Hysteria u may call it! :-)"
Intellectual_Mishap,"May 13, 2006",9/10,"Upon watching Dead Poets Society, I was truly touched - tears were brought to my eyes with the heart rendering tale of friendship, coming of age, death and loss. Robin Williams cements this film with his portrayal of John Keating, an inspirational English teacher who invokes his students to seize the day and live life, however within the confines of a strict conservative elitist academy - which bodes well for the adversarial route that emerges between Keating and the Institution. In short, it was truly wonderful, OK it's not raw and brimming with realism, however this is not what this film attempts to do - a pure gem with a fantastic cast, I would definitely recommend it."

anitab-1,"Mar 26, 2008",10/10,"Something this page doesn't inform you about Dead Poet's Society is the astute use of little-known or unknown actors and their top notch performances or the fact that it received four nominations at the Academy Awards for Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay.Robin Williams used this film as a vehicle for serious acting rather than the comedic roles and stand-up he was so popular for and he did a masterful job. Anybody that thinks it's easy for someone to go from comedy into serious roles ought to take a good look at this film if they haven't."
alexanderhel,"Apr 21, 2006",10/10,"This film is especially to be seen by young people around the ages of 13 to 17, I'm sure for most of them the movie will be the turning point of their lives and it will let them gain a different perspective.Generally I can say that the movie touched me, and still touches me every time I see it. A must see for everyone..For those who wish to have an idea about the story; The movie brings the lives of young high school students into your hearts and you feel the uniqueness and different qualities of each person(make projections to your own social environment. These children are studying in one of the ""best"" schools in the country, which strictly relies on traditional education methods but their life starts to change and their identities to vivified when a new teacher, Mr Keating who is a former graduate from the same school, starts lecturing there.. The rest is for everyone's taste and I can assure you that no matter who you are or where you live, you will find something from yourself in this movie. Don't miss it."
soniaklimantiri,"Mar 1, 2019",10/10,"I literally adore the movie.
My most favourite one.
It spread messages about free will, being authentic to yourself and following your heart and your individual path and the value and power of desire.
All these through the stories of some teenage boys."
BradenTheRater,"Aug 24, 2025",10/10,"Movies like these people will either think is a really boring movie or an extraordinary film. ""Dead Poets Society"" is a heavy film with mature themes and amazing acting, especially towards the end of the movie. Almost every single boy in their friend group teaches you a valuable life lesson. The ending is wholesome, sad, and inspiring that makes this movie packed full of good feelings.There is a very heavy side of the movie dealing with suicide and thinking independently, but there is also a cheerful side dealing with eloquent poetry and a bit a romance. Usually I will rate a movie 10 if it has an amazing twist or something like that so I don't give a ton of movies 10s. This movie was different though. It gave me a feeling like I could do anything. It also gave me a bit of anger towards the dad.Overall, ""Dead Poets Society"" is good for its themes, emotional impact, and especially good acting from Mr. Keating. The only critique I have is that this should be rated PG-13. Other than that, this film is perfect and one of the best."
freemz33,"Jun 14, 2002",N/A,"I really hated this film.  It's difficult to see Keeting as a human that you can relate to and thus you feel little of his pain when he is kicked out.BTW, what was the POINT of the little romance between ""Nwanda"" and that public school girl?Terrible and very overrated movie IMHO."
Jarlekin,"Apr 16, 2008",10/10,"This film really has moved my general opinion of life. Great actors' work and what a message to give! The first time I saw the film ""Dead Poets Society"" was as a school project, and I became rather interested in the concept, nothing more at the time. I delivered my paper and thought nothing of the film until it was on television 2 years later. Now, during these years, I had practically done nothing with my life and was kind of depressed but as I saw this movie again, I was astonished. I cried at the end etc. etc. and really went into a big think. The next couple of weeks, I did some ""wild"" things to just feel that I was living, and I actually began acting, got a tattoo on my arm that says ""Carpe Diem"" to remember me of my duty to get the best of life, and to get that today, and every day. To never count on tomorrow. Since I saw that movie, I have had nightmares of me lying as a 85 year old man, ready to die, thinking ""man, what have i actually done with my life. It's too late to do something about it now"". Anyway, no matter how you live your lives, I respect it, as long as you do, just what you really want to do :) Carpe Diem everyone"
ashutoshmadane-95934,"May 29, 2020",9/10,"This movie won Oscar for the Best original screenplay, it really worths it.
Peter Weir's teenage heartwarming drama, featuring Robin Williams as Mr. Keating in the lead character who is a teacher but his ways teaching are extraordinary and which made his student's life extraordinary.
This Film can be called as the inspiration for the new adolescent dramas even yhe bollywood films like Taare zameen par and 3 idiots has the glimpse of this film, but what makes this movie different is the ending which contains the reality.
The cinematography and production design was stunning and nowadays students can understand how the education system and the ways of enjoyments were at that time for the 70s born.
Really Loved the film."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jun 27, 2010",9/10,"Dead Poets Society is directed by Peter Weir (Picnic At Hanging Rock/Gallipoli) and stars Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Kurtwood Smith, Gale Hansen & Norman Lloyd. The script is written by Tom Schulman, based on his life at Montgomery Bell Academy, an all-boys preparatory school in Nashville, Tennessee. The film is set in 1959 at the fictional Welton Academy in Vermont (location shoot from St. Andrew's School in Middletown, Delaware). The story follows that of English teacher John Keating who uses his different method of teaching to inspire his students to be all that they can be whilst warning of the perils of conformity.Dead Poets Society was a monster smash hit that made almost $220 million profit in Worldwide box office takings. Not bad considering this was the year that film lovers flocked to see the likes of Batman, Lethal Weapon 2 and the third outing for one Indiana Jones. It showed that there was a mainstream market for serious drama if it is done well. And rest assured, Dead Poets Society is done well, very well in fact. Its launchpad is Schulman's Academy Award winning script that puts under the microscope educational conformity and the ogres that are parental and peer pressure. Enter the inspired casting of Robin Wiliams (nominated for BAFTA & Academy Award for Best Actor) as the teacher who urges his charges to see outside of the box that they have been placed in. Young men, soon to be full adults, who have their lives mapped out for them, are challenged by Mr Keating to be spontaneous, to pursue idealism and view life with new perspectives.Coming two years after he was nominated for Good Morning Vietnam, Williams once and for all proves to his doubters that he is a quality dramatic actor. His Keating is charismatic but without the mad-cap histrionics that Williams is famed for. Very controlled, in that what is in essence a catalyst role, Keating hasn't rushed to become said catalyst. He's a constant sympathetic presence, a father figure type, yet a confidential friend too. That Schulman's script has avoided the usual clichés that come with teacher-student relations in film's helps Williams as an actor to breath intelligent life into Keating. Even the flecks of humour that Williams is allowed to work from, such as Brando doing Shakespeare, play with a warmth that's essential to the relationships forming in the piece. Tho it's unquestionably Williams' movie (the film soars when he is on screen), the young cast playing the students get an A + for their sensitive portrayals. Notably Robert Sean Leonard (heartfelt), Ethan Hawke (haunting) & Gale Hansen (punky). While Kurtwood Smith leaves an indelible image as a domineering father.In the hands of Weir, the film, unsurprisingly to his fans, carries an air of mysticism too. Again working with one of his regular DOP's, John Seale, Weir knows how to capture the time, place and people in his movies; while cloaking them in dashes of mystical beauty. Be it the boys striding around the school grounds amidst autumnal hues, or plodding wearily thru the snowy terrain as Winter kicks in, Weir gives the scenes an apt poetic quality. It's also of note that these scenes, as well as the cave sequences where the Dead Poets Society meetings take place, blend with the characters emotional states. Sprightly and optimistic around the greenery, nervous and excited in the darkened cave, then heavy of heart and leg as the fall accompanies the emotionally turbulent last quarter. A last quarter that leads to what has now become a divisive ending. Some have (and will) come away from it irked and claiming it to be syrupy. Others such as myself find it uplifting, hopeful and a fitting end to the emotional roller-coaster that cast and crew have taken us on. Is your glass half full or half empty? An excellent and intelligent story is directed and acted accordingly, with its themes making it actually one of the best Punk Rock movies out there. 9/10"
werny-276-35517,"Nov 7, 2022",10/10,I saw this movie the first time when I was in High-School and I was amazed from the very beginning... The feeling it left behind will stay with you for a very long time. It is a mix of big sadness but also of hope and good fellowship.This movie has so many important and profound messages and is very moving. I think I saw it over a hundred times and I love it even more every time I see it!Robin Williams and the Guys from School played their roles so good and touchingly!It is my all time favorite movie I can only recommend it to everyone!More movies like that should be produced in the future!
Wuchakk,"May 23, 2011",10/10,"John Keating (Robin Williams), a new teacher at a stuffy prep school in 1959, inspires his students to capitalize on their natural talents and develop a passion for life because they only have one shot and in 60 years or so they'll all be worm-food. Each boy starts to act on Keating's dynamic ideas with explosive consequences , both good and bad.Released in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir, ""Dead Poets Society"" is a coming-of-age drama that's one of the most inspiring films ever made and ranks with my all-time favorite movies. The film captivates from the very beginning and doesn't release until it's over. That's when you KNOW a movie's really good, regardless of the subject matter. The cinematography and locations are top rate, shot in the Middletown region of Delaware (although the story itself takes place in Vermont). The quiet Fall & Winter scenes are breathtaking.This is not a spoiler, but there's a powerful scene at the climax where the students give Keating a daring final salute. Roger Ebert criticized the scene as ""so moving he wanted to throw up,"" but he's dead wrong. It is both unexpected and potent.The film contains a wealth of riches to mine in subsequent viewings, and I don't just mean the insights conjured from the poetry & prose. Here are a handful off the top of my head: ""The letter kills,"" referring to the legalistic nature of Neil's joyless father and most of the teachers at the school; the type of Judas (Cameron); the scapegoat (Keating); the stunning nature of feminine beauty (when Chris appears at the entrance of the school and the guys' mouths drop); the marvels of nature and how they're conducive to inspiration & spirituality; Keating's heartbroken countenance after Neil is removed from the theater crowd (Keating knows there's little he can do about the authoritarian mistreatment).There are a couple of insignificant scenes that don't work so well, but that's always the case, even with the best of films.One possible objection is that one boy's tragedy goes against the very message of the film to ""seize the day."" I disagree. The kid really started to ""seize the day"" but his passions were quenched by someone who didn't share Keating's mindset and he unfortunately couldn't handle it. Again, dynamic ideas have explosive consequences, good and bad. The other kids had varying results with their attempts to ""seize the day."" Some made progress in attaining their dreams and others got in trouble because they threw wisdom to the wind. The varying results make the story realistic.Another criticism was voiced by a reviewer who stated that the late night meetings at the cave to read poetry and inspire one another were ""homo erotic."" This interpretation could only be derived by an adult in our gay-obsessed modern culture. The kids in the film are about 16-17 years-old. This was the only way they could go out and have fun under the strict rules of a New England prep school in 1959. I remember when I was a teenager going out to the treehouse with several guys and drinking & smoking; we'd sometimes discuss metal/rock lyrics, which could be viewed as a delinquent form of poetry, and other such things. Sometimes we'd bring a girl or three. Likewise, in two of the cave meetings in the film one of the guys brings a couple babes from another school whilst the others look on in awe; on two other occasions a guy brings nude pages of whoa-men. I think that pretty much quells the ""homo-erotic"" theory.Most of those who scoff at this film's message go back to their 9 to 5 slavery (or 3 to 11 or 11 to 7, etc.) with no light at the end of the mundane tunnel. I encourage such people to give the film a second look. But BEWARE, there are no moronic explosions, CGI, non-stop 'action,' gore, OTT cussing, nudity or sex scenes; I know that's completely shocking, but it's true. Then I would encourage these people to take a good look at their lives and ask: Are you willing to change it? Throw off the shackles? Throw caution to the wind and pursue your true calling, your dream? Will you ""sieze the day""? Or will you continue to stagnate in a puddle of mediocrity? The answer that comes back will usually determine if this film becomes a favorite or not.FINAL ANALYSIS: Australian director Peter Weir has other good films like ""Witness"" and ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" (the latter is, incidentally, a film about an ALL-GIRLS school and can be boring if you're not in the mood for an ultra-mystery yarn), but ""Dead Poets Society"" is his best. Check it out. Give it a second (or third) chance if you haven't already. It's an outstanding story and it'll inspire you, especially if you've fallen into a life-stifling, growth-stultifying rut of drudgery.The film runs just over two hours (128 minutes).GRADE: A+"

studioAT,"Dec 13, 2014",6/10,"This film was one of the career highlights for Robin Williams and I can see why.This film gives him the opportunity to show off all the colours of that talent, he can be funny, he can be sentimental and in his role as Keating can make you laugh and cry in equal measure.A lot of credit has to go to director Peter Weir who gets such engaging performances from the young actors playing the boys at the school and also for channelling such a layered performance from Williams.I think though while the film is good it is slow paced at times and there are too many short scenes that don't really add to the piece. However,what makes up for that is the heart and message behind the film, and they are the reason that it is held in such high esteem by everyone who sees it."
whpratt1,"Jan 28, 2008",8/10,"Did not think that I would enjoy this film because I am not a big fan of Robin Williams who plays the role as John Keating, an English Professor who loves poetry and teaches this subject quite different than anyone else. Professor Keating gets down to basic facts about poetry and turns this subject into a very enjoyable experience which relates to how you can live in this world and have a great experience in doing whatever you really want to do and it also draws out young men's mental feelings about themselves and other people. This story also dwells with a young man named Todd Anderson, (Ethan Hawke) who is a very shy student and also had an older brother who attended this same college and was valedictorian, which are hard shoes to step into. Todd's room-mate is Neil Perry, ( Robert Sean Leonard) who has a very overbearing father and wants him to go to medical school and does not want him to waste his time on any social activities at the college. This story becomes very interesting with some of the students falling madly in love with pretty gals which makes this film a great all around treat to watch and enjoy."
kellyanne1990,"May 20, 2006",10/10,"It's my all time favorite! When I first saw this movie, it was in my 9th grade English class (and it was an assignment). I didn't like it the first time, but as I watched it the second time, I fell in love with it. Now it's on DVD, and I can enjoy it even more. Robin Williams plays a dramatic English teacher guiding his students to explore new insights. Robert Leonard plays the passionate son of an unreasonable demanding father. Ethan Hawke plays his new best friend who dares not to speak in front of anybody for his fear of people not listening to his ideas. Norman Lyodd plays the heartless headmaster who believes the role of tradition is more important than the hopes and dreams of the students at Welton. When I went to the website that had scripts of deleted scenes, some I wished had stayed in the film. I loved this movie because I could imagine myself being a part of the film. Thumbs up to the actors and the directors."
blanche-2,"Jan 8, 2013",8/10,"Robin Williams, Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Norman Lloyd, and Alexandra Powers star in ""Dead Poets Society,"" a 1989 film directed by Peter Weir and written by Tom Schulman.William plays an English teacher, John Keating, who comes back to his alma mater, an exclusive boys school, to teach. His teaching technique is very different from anyone else's.His focus is on encouraging students to find themselves by reading and writing poetry, to be individuals, and to know their own hearts, to see the world in a unique way, and to take risks - ""carpe diem.""One of the students finds Keating's old yearbook and learns he was part of something called The Dead Poets Society. When he's asked about it, Keating says that he and some of his fellow students met in a cave and read poetry.Neil (Leonard) and his friends Todd (Hawke), Knox (Josh Charles), Gale (Charlie Dalton) and others form the club again, find the cave, and sneak out at night. They read, laugh, and joke.The boys are inspired by Keating and, in their own lives, try to break out. Each has his own story but the main focus is Neil, whose dictatorial father is insisting that he become a doctor when in his heart, he wants to be an actor.Unfortunately, the school doesn't exactly want students to think for themselves and neither do their parents. Problems arise due to Keating's unorthodox teaching methods and opening these kids' minds.What a beautiful movie and what great imagery of birds flying free, the boys standing on their school desks and seeing the room from a different perspective, that idea of being ""up high"" used when Neil late at night looks out the window of his home.The film is predictable, but that doesn't make it any less powerful. It's set in 1959, and yes, kids did what their parents told them to do, and if your parents didn't like your choice of career, you were discouraged from going into it.I know someone who wanted to have a career in the army; his parents flew to Germany to see him. The young man returned, became an attorney, and was never a good one, nor a very happy person.Someone else I know actually got a part on Broadway and her parents made her return to her home town. Yes, that kind of thing happened. If you're creative like Neil, you can't really suppress it - the soul cries out for something else.Robert Sean Leonard, Wilson on ""House"" is very young here. He gives a marvelous performance. I've seen him on Broadway twice - he's a very serious and committed actor. Everyone is good in this well-cast film.Robin Williams absolutely shines as a warm, funny man who loves to teach and who believes teaching goes way beyond just the subject. He's just fantastic.For me, anyway, there weren't a lot of surprises in this film, but I loved it. It was both uplifting and depressing - the school wants the students to meet the status quo, and Keating wanted them to fly. Today, it's still not easy being different."
Geeky Randy,"Oct 16, 2015",9/10,"Film set in 1959 (based on screenwriter Schulman's own experiences at academy) about liberal English teacher Williams influencing his students who attend all-boys Welton Academy. Focuses more on the group of boys, but Williams is able to work his off-the-cuff dialogue enough to keep you reminded that it's still him. Absolutely beautiful Northeastern setting, with excellent enough pacing to keep you entertained the entire way through. The boys are surprisingly less dorky than you'd think. The film never takes the easy way out, with Weir and Schulman seeming perfectly content with impending gloom. Kudos also for developing how important teachers can be to their students and vice versa. Williams' character was inspired by Samuel Pickering.★★★½ (out of four)"
gab-14712,"Dec 19, 2021",9/10,"Have you ever had a high school English class where you were bored to death as your teacher droned on and on about Walt Whitman? I did which made me appreciate Dead Poets Society even more. This movie is about the love of teaching and how the great teachers resonate with their students and get them to fall in love with subjects they despise. What John Keating was to these students was like how my geometry teacher was with me. More than a decade after graduation, we still communicate over our shared interests. Admittedly a bit one-sided, the film nonetheless has a place in my heart. Robin Williams delivers a committed performance. The young cast is impressive (looking at you, Ethan Hawke.) The drama delivers the emotions (even if you can accuse the film of manipulation). By the end, I was choking up with emotion. I did not care that I saw the ending from miles away. The ""O Captain, O Captain"" scene tugs me every time I see it. When Robin Williams passed in 2014, this scene was used in memorium for the beloved actor.After the success of films such as Witness, Peter Weir became in high demand. He was given the script by Jeffrey Katzenberg (who worked with Disney at the time). Weir fell in love with the script so much, he was already in the casting process mere weeks later. The script, written by Tom Schulman, was about Schulman's life at a Tennessee prep school. Interesting enough, Keating was portrayed as a sick man in the original script. Weir wisely took those scenes away because he felt the film would focus on Keating more so than the students. I believe that was a very wise choice. As much as I want to know more about Keating, the movie is all about the students. The powerful message would deliver less of a gut punch if it wasn't. Weir created a soulful movie about individualism and free expression. As someone who was moved by several great teachers, Weir captured what it meant to have such people in our lives. For a minute, it made me want to be a teacher.Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) is a painfully shy student who finally attends a conservative New England prep school, Weldon Academy in the year 1959. Todd's older brother was valedictorian at the very same school. His roommate is Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard). Neil is a very bright student who dreams of an acting career but lives under the shadow of his domineering father (Kurtwood Smith). Enter into their lives does the new English teacher, Dr. John Keating (Robin Williams). He encourages the students to follow their dreams and to not be afraid to show who they are. He uses methods such as standing on desks among other methods. He encourages them to join a secret society that he started when he attended school. Each student goes against the status quo and face life-changing moments.Robin Williams goes dramatic to full effect but every once in a while, he will inject his humor into the proceedings. For those who despised learning about poetry in English class, you will chuckle or even whoop when Williams makes every student tear up their ""Introduction to Poetry"" nonsense. Who wants to read about parameters anyway? Williams has a strong performance, but the film is all about the kids. The kids go through some dramatic moments that require strong acting skills. The kids were up to the task. The standout is Ethan Hawke. He would, of course, grow up to be a big star. Williams would vouch for Hawke's intensity. I believed in his character arch the most. He starts the film shy but undergoes a major character transformation. Robert Sean Leonard likewise delivers a great performance. His storyline with his father is a major part of the film, so I will not say more at risk of spoilers. Just bring the tissues.Dead Poets Society is a film that knows how to make you laugh, cry, and grip your seat with tension. It is also a loving tribute to the profession of teaching. In a world where children are expected to be who their parents want them to be, there need to be adults that challenge this notion...like John Keating. Consequences happen but are necessary in the grand scheme of things. A shoutout needs to be given for John Seale's excellent cinematography and Maurice Jarre's memorable score. The drama can be heavily one-sided and there are relationship scenes with a young lady that are undercooked, but those are just minor complaints. Robin Williams and the children are at the center of a story you'll never forget.""Carpe diem. Seize the day, boys. Make your lives extraordinary.""

DrewAlexanderR1,"Jun 23, 2015",9/10,"Dead Poets Society is a film about a group of boys attending a prestigious Prep school in New England during the 1950's. The story follows Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), the younger brother of a former valedictorian, and his roommate, Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), a exceptionally bright, artistic student with a overbearing father.The school rests upon four pillars: tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence. However, a new outlook comes in the form of a new teacher. The new English teacher, a former student John Keating (Robin Williams), presents the students with a different outlook and encourages the boys to seize the day. His unorthodox teaching methods stir up his students imagination and anger some of the more traditional characters in the film.There are many themes throughout, but above all else the message is to follow your heart. The story is extremely well written and the cast of young actors do well to bring the out the uncertainties and excitement of adolescence. The set design and direction capture this period and produce a story that will pass the test of time.Robin Williams performance in this film ranks among his best. He has departed us, but his legacy lives on. He visits us through his films and tells us ""Carpe Diem""!"
uylwk,"Apr 21, 2024",8/10,"The movie is really a good reminder to the mental health of our children and letting them pursue their own dreams, because the movie makes you wonder long after the movie ends. There's this thing about the movie""Dead poets society"", the more you think about the movie, the more it starts to make sense. To me, it didn't make much sense when I first watched it, but now, it is one of the dearest movies to me. If you like the student teacher bond based movies, this is a go to for you. It shows how much can a teacher influence students, and make them bigger. The scene where he quoted "" They believed they're destined for great things, just like you do....
They're now fertlizing the daffodils ."" Gave me goosebumps."

After i was introduced to it in English class and after watching it changed my mind about old non-action films. For the first 5 minutes i was bored to death but then as the film progressed i began to understand the characters and recognize some actors. Half way though the film i thought ""Wow, I'm gonna hire this out"". The film had everything from comedy, drama, romance, suspense and enjoyment and i thought ""whats not to like"". A top notch performance by a young Ethan hawke who played a nervous Todd Anderson. Its a shame you don't get movies like this anymore but this one is an instant classic."

Rebellious English professor John Keating (a wonderfully restrained, Oscar-nominated performance from Robin Williams, free of his usual quirks which are enjoyable but would be unnecessary here) arrives at Welton Academy, a posh all-boys school with an ages-old curriculum set in stone. Mr. Keating ignores the school's approved teaching methods, much to the dismay of Headmaster Mr. Nolan (Norman Lloyd), and instills in his students a love of poetry, inspiring them to ignore authority and make their lives extraordinary. This backfires when aspiring actor Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) commits suicide after his father (a role tailor-made for Kurtwood Smith, better known now for his identical but comic role as Red Forman in TV's ""That '70s Show"") forces him to become a doctor. Mr. Keating is blamed for this tragedy, and his remaining students stand up for him when he is threatened to be fired.Dead Poets Society is a film about rebelling against authority. Mr. Keating is one of the great cinematic school teachers, and if he were real I'd give anything to be in his class. Williams is brilliant, but the real acting honours go to the actors playing the students, especially Leonard (who ironically now plays a doctor in TV's ""House"") and most notably a young Ethan Hawke, who delivers a tour de force performance as Todd Anderson, the student who is hit the hardest by Neil's death. Tom Schulman's glowing Oscar-winning screenplay is filled with less-than-perfect characters, a dash of much-needed humour, it avoids sentimentality and considering I often *hate* poetry, it makes the stuff seem interesting.However, it is Australian director Peter Weir's (who makes me, a budding filmmaker myself, proud to be an Australian) masterful handling of two key scenes late in the film which catapults it way beyond average status. The first is Neil Perry's suicide scene. Neil and his father have an argument one night after his father discovers Neil acting in a stage play. His father holds the power in the conversation and orders Neil to follow a career in medicine. Later on when his parents are asleep, Neil walks into his father's study, opens a drawer in the desk, takes out his father's revolver pistol and pulls the trigger. Weir wisely splashes this scene with dull and depressing colours (blacks and whites) to suit the mood described in Schulman's script, but instead of actually showing Neil pulling the trigger, Weir cuts away to Mr. Perry laying in his bed being awoken by the chilling sound of a gunshot downstairs. This makes my hair stand on end every time I watch the film.The second is the exceptional climax. Now that Mr. Keating has been held responsible for Neil's death, he has been fired and interrupts his former class (now taught by Mr. Nolan) to get his things before he leaves. Todd Anderson causes an outburst and sticks up for Mr. Keating by standing on his desk and shouting ""O CAPTAIN MY CAPTAIN!"" like Mr. Keating instructed his students. Soon half the class joins in, with Mr. Nolan shouting at them to all sit down. The class giving Mr. Keating a standing ovation shows how much one person can impact others' lives, either positively or negatively. In this case, Mr. Keating has given his students direction and a reason to live. It surely stands alongside One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back as one of the most unforgettable movie climaxes ever. Damn you, Oliver Stone.END OF SPOILERS!If there are any teenagers like me out there who are reading this review and haven't yet seen this remarkable film, I urge you to do so. It could just change your life.10/10.Catch ya!"
laurita_a,"Oct 26, 2000",10/10,"I fell in love with this film at first viewing.  It broke my heart and quickly entered in to my own private top five movies.  Robin Williams is one of the most versatile actors in the industry.  He plays drama and comedy with the same intensity and that is so rare.  Understandably though, he was nominated against a tough crowd that year (Morgan Freeman-Driving Miss Daisy, Daniel Day-Lewis-My Left Foot (winner), Kenneth Branagh-Henry V, and Tom Cruise-Born on the Fourth of July)."
wackoreviews,"May 22, 2024",9/10,"""O Captain! My Captain!"" A new English teacher, John Keating (Robin Williams), is introduced to an all-boys preparatory school that is known for its ancient traditions and high standards. He uses unorthodox methods to reach out to his students, who face enormous pressures from their parents and the school. With Keating's help, students Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) and others learn to break out of their shells, pursue their dreams and seize the day.I don't think I've ever been that emotional watching any movie ever. The movie is fabricated in a way where you build a very solid connection with all the lead characters. Normally, its pretty difficult for us to find a connection with just one main protagonist in any movie but ""Dead Poets Society"" was able to make me invested in more than one character in a 2 hours runtime only, which I personally found really impressive.What really affected the emotional aspect was the incredible performances. Obviously, Robin Williams stands out and delivers one of my personal favourite performances even though I'm pretty sure he didn't have a lot of screen time. Additionally, the whole supporting cast was just perfect and had a really good dynamic especially Williams.The movie really taught me a lot and I think that is very vital that people experience it and learn from it as it really is an emotional rollercoaster with a lesson.Score:9/10."
Vincentiu,"Aug 16, 2014",N/A,"for each of its viewers, it is more than a movie. it is a profound , touching experience. not only as result of a great team behind the images but for a special feeling who is mixture of memories and dreams. Robin Williams does a memorable role;young and real goods actors are at the first steps and that fact could be one of the keys for the beauty of film. the story has the force to transform the spectator in a character of it in the wise manner. because it is a book/movie about basic things. because it is courageous and poetic and warm and bitter , comfortable and eccentric. because it is a film about the viewer. that fact transforms each new meeting in a special experience. a film who has the role of frame. for old images, words and good intentions. and a magnificent definition of life out of ordinaries laws.a film about that kind of poetry who change existences. and the world."
briancham1994,"Sep 4, 2021",7/10,"This film is clearly attempting to be as inspirational as its teacher Mr. Keating. Using unconventional methods and a sense of self-confidence, Dead Poets Society/Mr. Keating aims to rouse us into being non-conformist and achieving our true selves. The problem is that it becomes endlessly preachy and repetitive, turning the characters into ready-made roles instead of real human beings. Mr. Keating is too good for this earth, the students are impressionable and roused to action, one student is shy but has his potential unlocked, another student falls into the trap of conformism and the school administration exists just to be villainous. On a scene-to-scene basis, the characters seem fleshed out and compelling, which made the story quite enjoyable to watch, but overall they just fit into standard storytelling slots, so by the end it didn't feel genuine. At least it had some nuance - the pranks and flirting really didn't go anywhere and Mr. Keating didn't keep his job - showing the imperfections of the lessons."
daorestes,"Jul 3, 2018",10/10,"This movie is package of perfection. Everything is perfect. Direction level is damn too high. Cast did their job superbly especially Robin Williams. Background sound is too good. Editing is well enough. Best thing about this movie is that it consists of dream, emotion, love, success, passion and drama. You will get a unknown(?) feeling after watching this movie. You can not describe that feeling to anyone. Finally, one thing i can say ""O Captain! My Captain!"""
PatrickH-2,"Apr 5, 1999",6/10,"The first time I saw this movie, I was struck by its poetic quality, and the emotions it drew from me were surprising.  The more I think about it, however, the more I realize how emotionally manipulative it is.  The plot- especially in the last third of the film- seems contrived just to pull the maximum amount of irony, pathos, and tears from the viewer, when in fact it is really just artificial.  The entire ending is meant to make the audience as mad as possible.  It works every time I see it, even though I see through the trick."
anadelavega,"May 18, 2024",10/10,"This is a very dear movie to me. I was in high school when I watched, 30 years ago, and now I fully understand why it moved me so much. At this moment I sit here after watching it again, and having lived and learned so much, and I realize that it touched something in me that was going to be very important in my life, in which my role has always been to look at things from a different perspective. And, like Thoreau, I wanted to live deep and suck out all the marrow of life, and that I did and do as much as I can. Thank you Robin W for giving life to my most beloved and awake teacher. I would have got up on that table too, to tell you oh captain, my captain!"
tytushar-87734,"Aug 22, 2023",8/10,"The movie I recently watched is undoubtedly one of the finest cinematic creations of all time. It delivers a profound message about never surrendering to conformity and the importance of seizing the day. Life is a precious, fleeting gift, and we exist on this planet only once before eventually departing from it. To truly experience existence and avoid the confines of conformity, we must embrace our individuality. Just as we will ultimately decompose, the film reminds us that we mustn't let ourselves decay in the mold of societal expectations.This movie has etched itself into my memory, even though I watched it 34 years after its release. It served as a poignant reminder that our beliefs are uniquely ours, and it's possible that the crowd may cast judgment. However, we are the creators of our own lives, and it's our responsibility to shape our destinies. This realization was both profound and transformative."
braddugg,"Aug 12, 2014",10/10,"One of the finest films. It is inspiring and needs to be seen just for sheer writing.Well written and wonderfully acted, this film does that something, which many films on teenagers fail to do. It inspires us to go out and live a life. To LIVE is a great deed for a teenager who will be missing out on life, in the run for the rot. The rot includes fulfilling aspirations of parents which are way different from his own, it include running for the marks and grades, it includes missing out on fun which we are supposed to have as teenagers, it essentially includes that we do not identify our dream and shall be living others dreams. Teenagers or adolescents do not know what they want to be in many cases, they figure that out as they grow. This can be because of influence by friends or by the college teachers or even an idea he just got or maybe a talent which he would have recognized just then. But before realizing that, they are pushed in many cases by parents into a corner and the parents squeeze what they want them to be. It is a failure and many teenagers succumb to this pressure and even give up life. The more than half, ordinary guys follow the aspirations of their parents which they believe is good for them. Because of the more or less universal thought that ""Parents think for the good of their kids"". Though in many cases it is true, it is a big lie in few cases.I take my life as an example, I wanted to do arts, but I was pushed into engineering. Now, I am not a good artist nor a considerable engineer. I am bad at both and I attribute the failure of this, to the choice done by my elders, who have not tried to figure out my aspirations and simply let me be what I want to be. Such, is the life of Neil Perry (played by Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor, while his father does not want him to be that.Acted wonderfully by Robin Williams, who plays the part of John Keating this film speaks volumes of how good an actor Robin is. His eyes and his mere sigh do tell a lot, which so many histrionics could not have said. This is a very controlled performance by Robin, and in this film and ""Good Will Hunting"" I rate his acting as his best ever till date.But the best part is not Robin Williams here, it is Peter Weir the director, who makes the scenes so personal and they can be related to many teenagers. We had fantasies in our teens, we wanted to be something big and something different, we wanted to acquire talents that will take us forward in our lives. So it is very easy to relate to any teenager or an adult who seems to have missed his teens.The another best or great part if Tom Schulman, who wrote the screenplay, giving us the wonderful lines and scenes that shall be etched in our memory long after we have watched it. this is one of the few films, I fall back on when I look for some inspiration, it essentially helps us write.Like in one scene, Robin Williams gives his students an Onion and asks them to see if they can write a poem on that. Damn, good it is.I am going with 5/5, this is wonderful and I like it, in fact Love it. My favorite dialog is the most famous line of Robin ""Carpe Diem. Seize the day boys. Make your lives extraordinary"""
MAXIMUS_747,"Aug 13, 2023",10/10,"Where do I even begin. At first I was going to describe this film as a very bittersweat masterpiece. But then I rember John Keatings words, ""Avoid using the word ""very"" because its lazy"". Only one of many iconic lines in this movie delivered by Robin Williams. I feel that this movie has had a very big impact on a lot of people, in a deep and raw way. I've been thinking about what could be causing it, is it the wonderful casting in the movie? Is it the scenografi that Peter Weir and his team have created from scratch? Or is it the outstanding storytelling that characterizes the film throughout? My answer to these questions is that it is all combined. It is these puzzle pieces that together form a whole and brings the film to life. Robin William, rest in peace, portrays his character (Mr. Keating) so well. William have the power to always interact with his audience and bring all of his charters to life, this is no exception. In addition to Williams' outstanding performance, there are also several child actors who do a brilliant job! Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, Josh Charles and Gale Hansen makes excellent efforts. If you take the brilliant casting and combins it with a story that is deep, heavy, thoughtful but most of all scially crogical, you have Dead Poets Society. A must see for all movie lovers out there!"
goodnightandgoodluckyou,"Apr 12, 2010",10/10,"I could agree with Roger Ebert had I not watched the movie from a completely different view point. For me, the movie works as an insight into a few boys life at Welton in 1959. First of all that year excites me, they were on the cusp of revolution and perhaps a few could predict what would happen a year later but the mini revolution that was started at the school, the daring concept of character over tradition, was something that would change those boys lives. In good ways, in bad ways but ultimately it would be a test of their characters in BIG ways.The story starts off with a new teacher. Robin Williams plays the passionate John Keating. He wants to teach the boys poetry ..not lines, but poetry in their souls. It is that spirit of such poetry and the spirit of carpe diem (seize the day) that is lit like a candle in some boys and a fire in others; Neil, Todd, Charlie, Knox, Meeks and Pitts as well as a few other of their classmates.Neil (Robert Sean Leonard pre, pre House) is a star pupil who wants to act, Todd (Ethan Hawke) is the new shy boy, Charlie (Gale Hansen) makes the boys laugh and us audience laugh and swoon, Knox (Josh Charles) is the one who dares to woo a girl he meets at a formal dinner, Meeks is the sweet boy and he and Pitts are scientifically both challenged and inspired.Mr Keating tells them to rip out anything that restricts their thinking. Poetry should be FELT. After all, we each have poetry in us and we each apply it in different ways. Not everyone actually reads and writes poetry, some spend hours trying to find a solution to a problem. That is what the movie is about to me, the spirit of that poetry and I feel it could have alienated people had it been more about the poetry, instead it doesn't pay ""lip service"" to poets and poems, but it gets right down to their core; which is their spirit.And I would have done what they did in their cave meetings too, which is basically have fun.My only minor ""problem"" with the movie lies in what Keating says- despite not being a scientist myself, I believe science can also be a source of beauty, poetry and something to stay alive for also. But I'm taking Mr Keating too literally and I'm sure Meeks and Pitts who were the scientists would have remembered what Mr Keating said and applied passion to science.The tragedy of the movie lies in the most passionate and proactive personality in the movie, the one whose Mr Keating's teachings light a fire inside. It is even more tragic given the year..perhaps ten years later, what happens would not have happened, one has to wonder.There have been those who find that storyline unrealistic and yet it is realistic, in that it happens. It's also a cautionary tales to parents who want to live through their children, I can even see similarities in this movie and Mahabharat which is a big epic in India based on fact.For me it took time to understand the character involved the storyline, because the movie is not a sit down let's talk type, it doesn't give you the answers, it doesn't underestimate the audience, it's an old school movie. I will say no more other than I think this character wanted to seize the passion.And like life, things and people in Dead Poets Society are always moving, the movie relies on you as an audience to pay attention and you might, just might, catch something that you missed before or that the person next to you missed. Poetry isn't going to make your life neat and tidy nor is it going to change your life, that is up to you. Mr Keating didn't come along with an in depth character analysis and the movie is dynamic, it has kinetic energy, when you see Welton, you see see different angled shots in the corridors, in class rooms, outside you see nature, there's music, on paper it sounds like any other movie but on screen Dead Poets Society is alive. Mr Keating represents the movie..and we represent the students. He COULD change our lives..if we keep ourselves open to what he says. That's how I like to watch this movie.And the final scene was not trite nor sweet to me, nor a kiss up, it was a final straw for a a living, breathing, sad, perhaps angry and inspired soul of a student AND a boy. A sweet ending wouldn't have any of that because it would tie things up and not leave them open. But like life Dead Poets Society isn't a carefully arranged neat little present. It's only neatness lies in how its made, a beautiful quality of a movie, I don't know the technical terms but I can say the cinematography and the direction are not slow, or too fast, when Keating is talking you see his words in each of the students faces, their reactions. Peter Weir the director has links between his movies, action and reaction and every person taking charge of their life, you watch Gallipoli, The Truman Show and Master and Commander, it's about human spirit. The final scene of Dead Poets Society is about human spirit, don't conform, take charge of your life and make a stand for what you believe in. The power of that scene can be applied to a grand action or a small one, but it's something I remember whenever I am forced to cower, with the rest of the world as Mr Nolans- the headmaster of Welton, trying to get me to their way or to be quiet. Except I watched the movie and I won't."
maevedugganjrd,"May 10, 2020",10/10,I love this movie with everything I have. The cast is very hot . And Robin Williams is just amazing of course in this role.
KevIntel,"Sep 5, 1999",N/A,"I just saw this exceptional film again, and I remembered why it touched me so much the first few times that I saw it.  In an age where Adam Sandler films are the big box office draws, and Jim Carrey movies are studied for artistic merit, this small film is an example of what Hollywood needs to target.  Directors often get wrapped up in elaborate technology, but forget that plot is the driving mechanism in all film and literature.  I relate this film in some ways to another great Robin Williams movie, ""Good Will Hunting.""  Both movies show that audiences still can be touched with intelligent and marked references to classic literature, and the themes contained in the work of anyone from Shakespeare to Cummings can be transferred to a modern audience.  Although I am off the point of this movie in among itself, my point on a larger scale is that Hollywood needs more pointed, smart, touching films.  I would rather indulge in a repeat viewing of a movie like ""Dead Poets"" as opposed to seeing what ""new spin"" has been added to the dead romantic comedy category.  To conclude, my basic point is... if you are a young teenager, and haven't had the opportunity to be exposed to the arts world, and sometimes feel you are being held down by the system, then give this film a viewing.  You will be glad you did."

pycckuupokc,"Mar 28, 2006",4/10,"I watched this film in English class this past week and I must say that I am a bit disappointed with what I saw. While many aspects of the film were perfectly engaging, I never felt grabbed by the story line, nor was I impressed with the script or, for that matter, actors.Robin Williams' character was perhaps the biggest disappointment for me. While I have always failed to see the reason for the hype Williams so often receives, I have appreciated some of his more serious roles, such as his role as the neurologist in ""Awakenings"". I was completely underwhelmed by Williams' acting in this movie. It was almost as if he was trying too hard to be the ""inspiring"" teacher and in doing so ended up being completely melodramatic, in both his ideals and his voice (he drifted in and out of a VERY annoying accent of some sort.) I'm not entirely sure why Williams was nominated for an Oscar for this role...The numerous clichés in the film also began to get to me after a while. I truly enjoyed the scenes where the boys were hanging out and talking. These were genuinely acted and scripted and were often very endearing. But the same is not true for the majority of the movie. I felt the teacher's teaching styles were almost too exaggerated for the movie. He would play some sort of game with the kids, they'd learn a lesson, and then be miraculously changed (an example of this was the whole ""carpe diem"" on the first day and how so soon after, everything became inspirational. Another scene that comes to mind is when the teacher helps the shy boy Todd Anderson create his own poetry.) There was no real work involved for this teacher. he uttered a couple of lines of poetry (and the most insipid and well known ones at that) and the boys were then ""thinking for themselves"".I couldn't see the whole controversy about the ""Society"" itself anyway. Much of what the boys were doing was hanging out in a cave at night. while this was certainly a ""discipline problem"", it hardly seems to pose a threat of any sort to the school.Anyway, I was overall underwhelmed by this film, but parts of it were OK."
peter78,"Oct 12, 2008",9/10,"I recently re-watched this film at my current ripe age of 30. I haven't watched this movie since the mid 90s when I watched it on TV. So that puts about 10-12 years since I've last seen it.I rented this movie because I recalled that it made such an impression on me. After watching the film again, I can remember why. The protagonists are a group of impressionable teenagers who are about to enter college. This is the age at which I saw this film.Robin Williams' character, Keating, is introduced as a teacher of poetry but becomes a teacher of life. His lessons of carpe diem (""seize the day""), living life to its fullest and nonconformity are the types of messages that ring true in the hearts and minds of teenagers.At this age, I find the film pleasurable but when I watched it at the time, I felt truly inspired. It was the sort of film that really made me think and feel and the general ideas sat with me for some time."
damadelbosque,"Jan 25, 2008",10/10,"I have watched this movie many times, the last time being just a few hours ago. And it just never stops getting to the deepest side of me. It makes me laugh, it makes me cry; and when it ends, it leaves me trembling... I tremble and I too want to step on the table. I want to go outside and sound my barbaric YAWP over the rooftops of all and eat the world like it's a cookie, like it's mine.I don't think there's anything missing from this film. The plot is great, it is beautifully made and all the performances are really powerful and moving. It doesn't make your life extraordinary, because that's your duty, but it surely makes you want to do it.I say seize the day and go watch this film right now; watch it many times and suck out all the marrow of it. Let it get to the deepest side of you too.Let's all open our minds and be Dead Poets! Because that's what this excellent film is all about. That's what life is all about."
amandacah,"Jul 10, 2004",10/10,"With director Peter Weir at the helm, here's a truly terrific film that's stood the test of time very well. Beautifully crafted with standout performances from Robin Williams(as the unconventional English professor), Ethan Hawke & Robert Sean Leonard, the film celebrates individuality and all those who want to ""seize the day"" and live life to the full.Full of warmth, wit and real perception, it's a joy from first to last though inevitably very poignant too as befits anything advocating an unequivocal embracing of all that life has to offer. I already wanted to write when I first saw this film in 1990 and it confirmed my career choice. I could wax lyrical about this all day but no, just watch it!"

Each time I watching it becomes more and more enthralling.  It is the only movie that acts like a drug to me.  The more I see it, the more I yearn to see it again.Dead Poets Society strikes me so hard and passionately that it is hard to differentciate myself from the story and the characters.  The cast of character in personality and over all style is me and my friends.  I am involved in the theatre arts and I feel as if I know Neil's passion for acting.  My friends all fit in line with characters from girl crazy to tall lanky and awkward.  I know everyone in this film which makes it more meaningful to me.When I first saw the movie I had never had anything touch me in that way, and I don't ever expect to see a movie like it again."

lee_eisenberg,"Jan 14, 2006",7/10,"I notice that Robin Williams often plays a free-spirited neophyte who introduces a new modus operandi, and his superiors try to stop him. ""Good Morning, Vietnam"" and ""Patch Adams"" are the two obvious examples, but ""Dead Poets Society"" is another (maybe even ""Awakenings"" fits into this category). In this one, he plays English professor John Keating, who teaches his students a new way of looking at everything in an Ivy League school in 1959.When I first saw this, I noticed that it starred the dad from ""That '70s Show"", and from this movie I learned that his name is Kurtwood Smith. Also starring are Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard. I've never seen a Peter Weir movie that I didn't like, and this affirms that list. Maybe it won't change how you view the world, but you're sure to like what Robin Williams makes everyone do with their textbooks."
chahlie-1,"Apr 15, 2006",5/10,"First, let me recommend Roger Ebert's review on this movie--he generally sums up the problems I have with it. The great American poet Wallace Stevens (who thankfully does not join the list of other great poets bastardised by this movie) wrote many aphorisms in his journals which were published posthumously; in one of those aphorisms he poignantly claimed that ""sentimentality is the failure of feeling."" Dead Poet's Society is cloyingly sentimental. I wince at so many moments: references made to poems that the writers evidently had no deep connection with, scenes contrived for the sole purpose of providing Robin Williams with a stage for his stand-up comedy jokes and impressions, and a suicide motivated by formulaic and totally un-compelling issues. Please watch it again...It's not as good as you thought."
wtomrice,"Jan 17, 2006",10/10,"I don't cry very often in movies, but I cry every time near the end of this one. To show what a profound influence literature and free thought can have on young minds is priceless, and to tie in the passion of Thoreau, Whitman, Shakespeare and others makes this movie invaluable. I have seen it close to 50 times, and always feel as if I have just watched it for the first time. Robin Williams is fantastic, and gives what I still consider the best performance of his career. Don't believe what some of the critics say about this movie (the main message of the movie is to think for yourself and be your own person!); watch it with an open mind and you could be changed forever."
HORROR_FAN_1,"Feb 10, 2003",9/10,"For once a story that doesnt have a happy ending. Dead poets society is a tragic story of a young man wishing to be an actor but for his stubborn father who wants and demands him to be a doctor. This is not the only story however, there are other tales such as love, compassion and humour. It is a great film and I have to admit I was sceptical when I saw that Robin Williams was the main star. However, he is brilliant in this movie and makes it work as the compassionate and funny Mr. Keating.Rating 9/10. Great."
wes-connors,"Jul 29, 2013",8/10,"In 1959 Delaware (as Vermont), charismatic poetry teacher Robin Williams (as John Keating) arrives to begin work at the ""Welton Academy"" preparatory school for boys. An alumni of the school, Mr. Williams teaches poetry with uncommon zeal. To gain attention, he demands students tear out the pages of books written by essayists with whom he does not agree. To get participation, he invites students to stand on the teacher's desk. Williams does impersonations of Marlon Brando and John Wayne. His motto is ""Seize the Day,"" a directive made popular by novelist Saul Bellow. Yes, this class is fun...Williams teaches the ""dangers of conforming,"" and encourages students to think for themselves. When they learn Williams belonged to a clandestine club called the ""Dead Poets Society"" when he was a ""Welton"" student, the class decides to revive the group. They meet in a cave to read poetry by the masters - but, mainly, they just goof around. Playing the saxophone and sharing ""Playboy""-type centerfolds accompany Walt Whitman. Because Williams'' influence extends perilously beyond the classroom, his ""unorthodox teaching methods"" get the popular teacher in trouble with school administrators...This above average production won good notices and award consideration for director Peter Weir and star Robin Williams. Originally, the teacher held back a secret; ""Oscar""-winning writer Tom Schulman was persuaded to drop the idea, so we and the character are left with a gap. Williams' ""Keating"" is put on the sidelines in favor of the students. Nothing against the actors, who perform exceptionally, but they do look more like handsome young college-aged models than typical high-school aged boys. There is some physical diversity in the extended supporting cast, though. A few of the boys wear glasses...The main stars are sensitive writer Ethan Hawke (as Todd Anderson) and his roommate, aspiring actor Robert Sean Leonard (as Neil Perry). The next tier includes prankster Gale Hansen (as Charlie Dalton) and lovelorn Josh Charles (as Knox Overstreet). Although these players are almost interchangeable, the actors create distinguishable characters. Best of the remaining parts goes to Dylan Kussman (as Richard Cameron), who perversely turns out to be the group's real non-conformist. The film is too self-consciously calculating and manipulative to be fully masterful, but it sure looks nice.******** Dead Poets Society (6/2/89) Peter Weir ~ Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, Robert Sean Leonard, Gale Hansen"
K-Slicer,"Feb 15, 2003",10/10,"When ""The Simpsons"" comments on this movie destroying the profession of education, it made me want to watch it.  This movie is good for ten reasons...1) Peter Weir directs with a haunting hand and certain scenes show it very well. 2) Robin Williams blew me away as John Keating.  It made me wonder why he didn't win the Oscar for Best Actor. 3) The story and plotting were exceptional.  I didn't expect the suicide scene near the conclusion. 4) Ethan Hawke showed his early star power here as the silent student who wants to be a poet. 5) Robert Sean Leonard pulled in an excellent performance as the student wanting to do things his way. 6) All the supporting performances were well-done and not overacted. 7) The cinematography was crisp and clear.  The scene with the bike going down the hill is the best example I can offer there. 8) This was a movie about a teacher inspiring students and I have a soft spot for films like this. 9) There is a good warning in film about actions having unexpected and very unintentional consequences. 10) The last five minutes are unbelieveable.  If I were in a theater, I would have given a standing ovation.With those reasons, this film gets 10 out of 10!  ""The Dead Poets Society"" rules and may it live on.  Here ends my rant!"
yris2002,"Jan 2, 2010",10/10,"I saw ""The dead poets society"" on TV for the umpteenth time, after at least ten years. And I felt like writing something about this awesome picture and I am happy to write the first review of the year with a movie full of faith, inspiration and courage. It is certainly one of my ten favourite pictures, each time capable of arousing such a strong emotional impact, that words seem to be insufficient, as too limited and limiting. In this sense, I think it is very difficult to say something new, or vaguely original about such a masterpiece that can speak and appeal naturally to the public without needing any praising words. However, after seeing it I couldn't but compare the impact it exerted on me the first time I saw it, being in my teens, and now, being a young woman. The first time represented a revelation, Joyce would call it an epiphany, I was totally absorbed and completely overwhelmed and, although not being able to get subtle and more mature hints, it was from the moment I saw it that I could clearly distinguish between teachers who meant teaching as a vocation, and those who just taught to make a living. I never had the fortune of enjoying a teacher of such a sort, but could feel those who really felt the responsibility of educating, and growing children and not only passing information to them. This time I still felt deeply emotionally involved, and still in the last scene I wanted to enter and stand on that desk, and join the students shouting ""Oh Captain, My captain"". Let's admit, that even though the student's years are far away, I still look forward to meeting a man like him, as endowed with a sensitivity and a human depth that would make him an ideal friend, or a perfect soul-mate. In the end, I can only say: see it and feel it, I have no children, nor students, but if I had I would let them see it, and I would consider it as a precious gift."
perni,"May 14, 2003",N/A,"I can see why Roger Ebert would include this in his book of most reviled movies. Overall it just seemed really unrealistic and oozes with sentimentality to the point of nausea. Now don't get me wrong, Robin Williams is a great comedian, but his socially aware movies like this one and Patch Adams (which, if you think about it, are extremely similar) tend to make me gag. Also, why is every adult in this movie besides Williams 100% pure eeeeevil? The rest of the faculty at the prep school, every parent, even the janitors are these horribly bitter, mean souls who have nothing better to do than scowl at the screen. It's just a wee bit one-sided, is all I'm saying. And I found it hard to sympathize with Williams' character because his peers actually made some good points. Sure, it's one thing to encourage your students, but at a certain point things can get out of hand. Now comes my big speech about the main plot point: Neil's suicide. I had NO IDEA this was coming at me when I saw this character putting on his Shakespearean crown of thorns and walking to his dad's office. My classmates and I joked about him possibly axing his father (who had forbidden him to become an actor because he is eeevil), or axing himself, but we didn't think it would actually happen. And I just laughed out loud at the father's reaction to seeing his son and how the director handled it. Hint, it's in slow motion and he screams, ""Noooooooooo!"" Very cheesy. Then there is the ending, where Williams gets fired, half of the students get expelled, and the audience is supposed to believe that standing on your desks fixes everything. Sorry, but your teacher is still fired kids, and guess what? Now you have detention for standing on the desks! All in all, a sappy melodrama that lasted way too long, with about 100 lackluster subplots and too many characters. 1/4 stars"
pmolloy-37050,"Jul 30, 2019",6/10,"Great performance of Robert Williams (RIP), although it makes me wander why he's always a professor or a mentor, think Good will Hunting and Jumanji. Great performance nonetheless. One thing that hasn't aged great is that this is about the life of mostly rich white prep kids in new England. Other than that, solid movie, I was expecting a little more given the hype. Terrible style in the 80's. Movie a little too corny/ black and white.
Robert Sean Leonard 'got the short end of the stick when we reflect on his career, I guess he's doing good in the theater."
seymourpantaloons,"Mar 18, 2021",6/10,"Felt like Oscar bait to me. Robin Williams is playing ""cool teacher"", the guy who's supposed to be funny in the world of the movie. I didn't find him nearly as funny as his fellow characters, which created a big divide between me and the characters. This is a big problem in media, when a character is supposed to be a funny guy but the viewer does not see it that way. That's probably the main reason that so many people hate on Seinfeld, because they can't relate to the logic of a world in which Jerry's jokes all land.Another problem is the poetry references and shoehorned motivations. I did not feel a shred of connection to the kid who looked like Jim Carrey, and he is a crucial sympathetic character. I just couldn't buy his motivation.I did not give a cum about any of the other boys aside to Charlie. Cameron, Todd, Knox, they were all forgettable and unimportant.This movie gets a 6 because the end was strong, and the death was ballsy. Robin Williams is charming, even if he isn't very funny here. Oscar bait doesn't taste good, but it also doesn't deserve a terrible review. This movie is slightly above average."
fredrikgunerius,"Oct 25, 2024",4/10,"This goody-goody picture about an unconventional English teacher who awakens a ""passion"" in his prep school students through literature and poetry was both a commercial and critical success at its time of release, hailed for its dramatic power and Robin Williams' performance. But if you can sit through it without feeling unpleasantly, almost suffocatingly manipulated - not to mention rather cheated - I applaud your tolerance. The script, by Tom Schulman, is so in love with its own perceived sophistication and intellectualism that any concern for truthfulness is flimsily brushed aside. And the director, Peter Weir, never lets his young cast breathe and create discernable characters in their own right. Although Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke look great and demonstrate hints of talent in their parts, their minutely controlled performances reveal them to be puppets for Weir's melodramatic agenda. And the ever so sympathetic Williams is his willing adjutant."
h-28658,"Jun 22, 2020",8/10,It seems quite outdated nowadays and its faults are not to be overlooked but I guess it still has some powerful elements.
magnuslhad,"May 6, 2016",10/10,"Revisiting Dead Poets' Society decades after first viewing, it is reassuring to see that it has not only lasted, but rewards with repeat viewing. A new English teacher at an elite boys' boarding school brings a maverick sense of teaching to the stuffy institution, injecting vitality into the life of some of the boys, while putting himself on a collision course with the school authorities. Great scenes abound: the walk in the courtyard to teach about the dangers of conformity, Tom's blindfolded poetry read, and the climactic tribute of the boys to their fallen captain, one of the greatest tear-jerkers in cinema. Look at Weir's angle and camera placement - absolutely perfect. His extreme wide shot of a grieving Tom in a snow landscape, and his silent depiction of Neil's demise, all attest to poetry in both script and mise-en-scene. Very few films are faultless, but there is not one word, shot, casting decision or any other element of this film that one would change. Outstanding cinema."
Kirpianuscus,"Jul 4, 2016",N/A,"against any verdict, any definition, it remains a special film. for the story, off course. but, more important, for the extraordinary cast. names and performances. the spirit of an age. and the clash with cold real world. an eulogy to the freedom. and a precious memory about the school as factory of spirit, belief and beauty. its flavor - fresh, powerful, seductive - is the basic point to understand as a kind of revelation. sure, the novel is great. but the film preserves, in each scene, a kind of magic. the experience of it could be , the passion of a cause, the teaching as a kind of open the windows to yourself. each of that details does Dead Poets Society a special film. not beautiful or great or impressive or good. only special. and that is its the most important virtue."
mahmoudoras,"Nov 7, 2020",6/10,"The concept in itself is great ,but the plot in the movie is so thin that you can see the uselessness behind it,it's main goal is to defy the normal,and I quote'""seize the day"" but ironically all the movie is showing otherwise,and the ending is so cheesy ,like comeone ,it started really well but seriously we r not 12 here"
wdbasinger,"Mar 7, 2006",1/10,"This movie could have been an interesting cultural and social statement about students attempting to study literature and to be creative in their own individual ways. But that is not what happens in the movie. Based on my observations of the teacher's attitudes and techniques, everything starts on the wrong foot.Now, the teacher played by Robin Williams proclaims to the students that one should be free-spirited and to be a seeker after art and truth. That is one of the purposes of poetry. There is nothing wrong with that at all. However, that is not what happens in the movie. The teacher played by Robin Williams encourages students to tear out part of a textbook because he disagrees with the author's comments. When I was a student, there were things that I disagreed with in some books, but I would never tear out the pages. How does tearing out pages of a book with which one disagrees encourage creativity and learning ? Moreover, how does such an action teach a student to respect the views of other people, whether you agree with them or not? This type of action tends to foster intolerance rather than creativity. In addition, in the film, the students are encouraged to ""find their own space"" by wandering around or by standing on top of their desks? This seems to have some value in a psychology experiment, but may have dubious value in a course of English literature.There is a difference between being ""free-spirited"" on one hand and rebellious on the other. Being ""free-spirited"" implies a desire to explore the unknown and to seek truth and beauty. This does not happen in the movie. Rather, the students decide to use some of the comments that they heard in the class to rebel against and provoke the administration. In once case, one student gets paddled. And for what purpose ?Next, the film could have been an interesting experiment in synthesizing the different approaches to pedagogy when comparing the ""old school"" structured techniques of the school dean with the ""free spirited"" techniques of the teacher played by Robin Williams, but once again, this does not happen in the movie. Rather, a full-blown adversary relationship develops which ends tragically. As mentioned earlier, the two points of view and systems can be brought together in harmony, but a meeting of the minds does not happen in the film. A vicious spirit of intolerance develops among the protagonists on both sides, not just with the school dean, but among the students as well.What later develops in the film is a total disaster as the two systems of pedagogy remain at enmity with each other as Robin Williams is eventually forced out of his position at the school. (One reviewer of this movie stated that the Robin Williams character was trying to use the students as ""cannon fodder"" in order to wage some sort of battle with the conservative administration for reason that were unclear. Somehow, I did not pick up on that. If true, then the Robin Williams character deserved to be terminated.) Worst of all still, death becomes a reality when one of the students commits suicide, something which should never have entered the plot. The student commits suicide because of his father's objections over his extracurricular thespian activities. Here, one could have come to some sort of common ground between the ""old school"" attitudes of the father vis-a-vis the ""free spirited"" lifestyle of his son. But, once again, this does not happen in the movie. Instead, the son kill himself, a cowardly act to be sure, something which should never have happened. From here, the plot degenerates at an accelerated rate. The film at this point becomes totally unwatchable.The teacher played by Robin Williams is not the direct cause of the suicide, but his approach to unrestrained, unstructured pedagogy that borders on nihilism is a factor that leads up to the events that precede the plot's tragedy. I would like to think that the teacher portrayed by Robin Williams had good intentions that went wrong.Robin Williams has been in better films such as ""Patch Adams"" and ""Goog Morning, Vietnam"". But this film represents his cinematic nadir.I rated this film 1 out of 10. I would have rated it a total 0 because of the direction of the plot. However, I think 0 out of 10 would still be too generous.Dan Basinger"
jz-28468,"Dec 15, 2021",9/10,"With the motto of tradition, honor, discipline, and excellence, the curriculum in this ""best preparatory school in the United States"" targets at pursuing students' high academic achievement, i.e., ""preparing them for college and the rest would take care of itself,"" using the school leader's words. On the contrary, Keating cares about ""the rest"": he uses unorthodox teaching methods in the classroom and teaches students to suck the marrow out of life. I love how Keating employs poems as his teaching methods. While connecting textbook content with real-world situation, these poems help his students dig deeper into his teaching topics like learning to think for themselves and trusting that your own beliefs are unique.From the comparison between Keating's teaching and other teachers' teaching, this film reflects different purposes of education, portrays how knowledge for the curriculum is selected and organized differently, and discusses who should make curricular decisions. Take the last aspect as an example. The school principal tells Keating that ""the curriculum here is set. It's proven. It works. If you question it, what's to prevent them from doing the same,"" and he forbids Keating to change the curriculum."
Carma_Gagne_Chan,"Feb 21, 2011",10/10,"From script to casting to directing, editing, sound, setting, cinematography, performances -- this film is flawless. It's a movie I can watch again and again, already have and will watch it again with any new friend who wants to see it. It's a movie I will pay to see again. I would NEVER pirate this film -- that's despicable -- these artists deserve residual income! This story is fresh food to souls, hearts and minds dwindling in a world of zombies, vampires, bloodlust, phony masculinity, phony femininity, numbing avarice and over-the-top fashionistas.Thank goodness for Walt Whitman and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for E. E. Cummings and men who can appreciate him. Thank goodness for Dr. Seuss and men who can be grateful for the sacred moments of reading his books to children.Thank goodness for men who get that boys can become great men, regardless of how much muscle fiber is on their bones, or how little interest they have in sports. That words have power. Artistry is potent. Romance is courage."
SilverScreenSoul,"Nov 29, 2023",10/10,"Having procrastinated far too long and having kept this movie in the watchlist for years. I have finally brought myself to watch this film that is as beautiful as it is poignant and as empowering as it is moving.Though I have rated numerous films over the years, this is my first written review on this app. I have always felt daunted by the much more intimidatingly long and detailed reviews left by the movie connoisseurs with all the pertinent film terminologies.The acting was superb. Williams (Mr Keating) and Leonard (Neil) were outstanding. All the characters and every little detail, even those that did not have a line (including the boy that constantly rubs his nose with his white handkerchief ) were brilliantly written on screen by the writers. To my delight, there was little predictability, no over-the-top scenes, and thankfully no cringe-worthy moments.As someone who had barely read a line of poetry, nor had known a thing about Byron, Thoreau or Tennyson (all poets whose names I had to search up again), the Dead Poets Society has converted me into a proselyte. Not merely a proselyte of remarkable poetry, but one who dares to dream, to pursue what he loves, and to inspire others as Keating inspires the class. In the face of growing opposition, in light of baseless opinions, in defiance of old-fashioned expectations and norms.This film, from the moment it began, till the charged and iconic final scene, had me rapt, spellbound and inspirited. It has left an indelible mark and impression on me."
ladylynch,"Aug 4, 2000",10/10,"I love this movie!  It has become a well-loved classic over the past decade. Robin Williams, perhaps one of the most under-rated actors of our time, is wonderful as the caring English teacher who reaches beyond the classroom to touch the lives of his students.  It is the movie that inspired me to become an educator, and it still inspires me to try my hardest to reach even the unreachable.  A must see!!"
Winds_of_Destination,"Apr 28, 2008",10/10,"I saw ""Dead Poets Society"" for the first time last night. It was magical.Every character, played to perfection by all actors, was very impressionable and very...real. Yes, they're poetic nerds, but it was still so easy for me to connect with not just one, but all of them. I understood their emotions and reasoning, and at the end of the movie, felt inspired ""to seize the day"". It really left me feeling that way.Some people might feel like the end scene is a bit corny, but to me, it didn't feel corny, thankfully. To be honest, I wasn't 100% satisfied with the end, but I wasn't disappointed either. The majority of the film is light-hearted and easy-going, but it certainly does get darker and slightly depressing when it reaches the climax. The film doesn't feel as great in the aftermath of the climax, to me, since its really different from the rest of the film, but its not clichéd, and it still feels very real. But it just kind of puts the ""carpe diem"" thing to the side and replaces it with darkness, which is out of place. But that's what happens in real life.When all is said and done, the power of the movie leaves you dazzled and inspired. I never felt more inspired and joyful at the end of a movie; this movie is that good. I don't know if I would say its one of the greatest films ever if you look at it from a technical and analytical point of view, but it is one of my favorites. Seize the day. How? Watch this film. Its great! 9.8/10"
cinematic_aficionado,"Dec 6, 2003",N/A,"This movie is just so beyond words, great performances, great story line, sending us all a big wave about life, love, dreams and expectations of others.Even the dramatic ending it has gives us a powerfull meaning. Does life worth living if it is the life others have chosen for us? There is always a way out."
dwpollar,"Apr 7, 2002",7/10,"1st watched 4/7/2002 - 7 out of 10(Dir-Peter Weir): Excellent story and superb direction by Weir make this drama work.  There have been many movies about teacher's who relate to their students in greater ways than what normally is expected but this one is more about the students than the teacher.  Robin Williams plays a new English teacher for a very high-brow preparatory school and doesn't follow the book to teach his kids.  He emphasizes that they ""Sieze"" every day because it may be their last and teaches them how poetry is about passion of life rather than just a subject in school.  Some of the students grab a-hold of his teaching and form a secret soceity that reads poetry in a scary cave near the school. The philosophy bleeds into their lives and starts to reek havic on their normal everyday lives but they for once are truly learning about themselves and learning from their life experiences. A tragedy occurs with one of the students and this is where the story takes a turn and life starts to be the judge as to whether the students really believe what they think they do. Excellent performances and a compelling story keep you involved with the characters till the end.  In my opinion, the ending left a lot to be desired but the rest of the movie was a typical well-done Peter Weir directed story."
ian_harris,"Apr 10, 2003",4/10,"Well I'd heard great things about this movie, but it didn't really cut the mustard for me.There are potentially great issues up for debate here, but they are not properly dealt with in this movie: - does the traditional, disciplined style of education work? - should parents strongly direct their children's career paths? - are teenagers easily influenced by parents, teachers etc. or not? - is it possible to pull by making an idiot of yourself?I went to a public school (message to non UK readers - ""public"" means ""private, elitist"" in the UK) albeit not as a border and nowhere near as grand a place as that depicted in the film.  I recognised some of the boys angst.  I recognised some of the teacher types - even Keating seemed like only a slightly exaggerated form of one or two teachers I knew.But the film didn't work.  It seemed manipulative to me.  It didn't grapple with the issues where it mattered.  It was sanctimonious.  It was predictable.  No school that stuffy would have hired such a notorious alumnus to teach.If you want great stuff on influences on young people and their educational angst, try reading Demian and/or The Glass Bead Game by Herman Hesse.  If elitist schools is your bag, read or see the Harry Potter stuff.  If Robin Williams being the maverick takes your fancy, try Good Morning, Vietnam.Life is short, so when ""gathering ye rosebuds while ye may"", I suggest you gather some other stuff and give the dead poets a miss."
zkonedog,"Mar 12, 2017",9/10,"It's easy to look back on ""Dead Poets Society"" and see only cliche (standing on desks, ""oh captain my captain"", etc.). But this is the film that invented the tropes themselves! If you can look past a little bit of over-exposed (from the present viewpoint) cheese, you'll find an utterly timeless film that may have been the zenith of one acting talent and the launching point of another.For a very basic overview, ""Dead Poets Society"" focuses on a prestigious East Coast preparatory school in 1959. The students have their entire future mapped out (law, medicine, politics, etc.) and are under intense pressure to succeed by strict prefects and even stricter parents. Introduced to this atmosphere is new English professor John Keating (Robin Williams), whose unconventional teaching philosophy rankles the traditional faculty, inspires his students--such as Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) & Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke)-- and forever changes the landscape of the institution.At heart, this film is an ode to non-conformist thinking and artistic endeavor, set in the perfect atmosphere and time in life (adolescence) to be rendered timeless. As long as schools still have classrooms where students gather together, ""Dead Poets Society"" will remain relevant thematically. That being said, it isn't overly saccharine or preachy. All of Keating's inspirational messages are very much portrayed in the context of the real world and its various shades of grey.In terms of acting, one could make a case that this is the peak of Robin Williams' serious roles. His unstoppable energy breathes life into a role that could have been played by others--but to far less perfection. Simultaneously, the career of Hawke was launched here with his emotional portrayal of a young man caught in the middle of a newfound artistic passion and the realities of his real life. Those two standouts are also surrounded by a solid auxiliary cast--there's really not a bad performance here.Does ""Dead Poets Society"" put a toe over the line of cheesiness a few times? Sure. That's probably why--even after multiple viewings--I can't quite give it the full 10/10 stars. But it has such a raw, youthful energy to it and espouses such a positive message for lovers of the performing arts that I consider it just a notch below that top mark. Whether you have witnessed the infamous scenes a thousand times or may be viewing them for the first time, it's a treat--that might just have you re-evaluating your life goals as the credits roll."
serghei_romanu,"Jan 20, 2010",10/10,"Very touching drama about the moral value on which most of us sees as irrelevant.Dead Poets Society is no more, no less than a masterpiece, along with ""Back to the Future"" the best 80's creation, and another proof of Peter Wier's gigantic talent.The story focuses on life experience, as seen from inside a group of students, an experience which radically changes, one they meet Mr. Keating, the new English teacher. With time, he encourages them to live the moment (carpe diem), to see beyond the materialism, the pleasures of adolescence and introduces them in the world of poetry and deep meanings. However, it seems not everyone appreciates the teacher's attempt, and problems don't cease to occur, in a very dramatic end, which leaves you with quite a bitter taste, I might add.The acting was at its brightest. From Robin Williams I expected nothing less than impressive, because I've always considered him to be, one of the most skilled actors, here making no exception as Professor Keating, a sensitive man who experiences happiness through poetry, a sincere and altruist person who fervently wants to share his beloved passion with his much younger students.The real surprise was the performance of Robert Sean Leonard (Wilson from House MD TV series ) impersonating Neil Perry, a boy who loves acting but can't follow his dream because of his father's wish, as if his opinion didn't count at all, as if his personality was literally caged.This is actually the meaning of this title, the misery and suffering of not being able to do what you like most... even if that doesn't suit your parents. Dead Poets Society insists on the differences between people, shows us that what some brave people built with passion and warmth can be destroyed by others incompetence and primitivism.The world imagined by Wier, to whom I sincerely thank for crafting this beautiful film, is a divided one, always in the middle of a twister,a hurricane or what any other word you can think of, a non-stop tiresome conflict of interests.To conclude, Dead Poets Society, is a title of unique atmosphere, beautiful acting samples, and last but not least, masterly directing. It's like a french wine, it gets better and better, as time goes on.All being said I rate this title a ***** out of *****"
flaviolettasorrentino,"Apr 12, 2024",10/10,"I lost count of how many times i watched this movie and i cry everytime. This movie leaves me with hope for the future but at the same time i feel empty, like something was taken away from me. This movie gives me a lot of different feelings and it will be forever my comfort movie. I loved the story, the way it was filmed and the message that it tries to give other people. I love the poetry of this movie. This movie is a masterpiece and i think it's one of the best movies ever made (it's obviously my opinion).

theshaymaah,"Nov 30, 2022",10/10,"Making us thinking about the concept of living but not living at all; how as human beings we somewhat feel lost like we are wasting our time. How it touched all of the things we go through in life without the movie feeling rushed nor forced. Youth and all what comes with it of difficulties of choosing between passion or ""success"". I think as a student I would have appreciated a teacher like Keating, that would try to get me out of my comfort zone and try to showcase all my talent, to confront me with my insecurities This movie is genius and the cast is absolutely perfect. It deserves a million stars review."
leonardvillan,"Jul 7, 2022",8/10,"Ending powerful. This is one of Robin Williams finest performances-I do believe he should have been at least nominated for best actor and either the guy who plays Neil or Ethan Hawk should have been nominated for best supporting actor. The frindships that are forged in the school are genuine and believable and the people are those that you can relate to. I myself can relate to Todd, shy and a bit insecure of who he is. John Keating-played by Robin Williams-is a teacher who believes in more then just teaching about whats in the books, he believes in teaching about *life* and seazing the day. This movie shows how important it is to live each day to your fullest and to follow your dreams. I have seen many powerful films, and Dead Poets Society is one of the most powerful films I have ever seen. It captures the essance of what a film should to do a person. It shows a different view of life and makes you question things. It brings tears in your eyes as well as laughter. Even though I get emotional during films very rarly do I cry in them, but I did cry during the end of the movie with what happened to Neil and Keating. The ending to this day had a powerful effect on me and not many movies has an effect on you to the point where you get emotional and uplifted just thinking about the movie. It is a movie where you would watch many times and each time find something new with it."
ines_fr,"Apr 18, 2020",10/10,"This movie is absolutely life-changing and one that you will undoubtedly remember for the rest of your life, changing little by little the way you perceive life.This movie is a wake-up call to the dangers of conformism, to enjoy our life at the most (""seize the day""), to try to look at things from different perspectives and, more importantly to me, that no matter what others think, we have the power to change the world and make our own destiny.""The powerful play goes on and you may contribute a verse. What will your verse be?"".This movie is pure poetry within frames and something that will, certainly, make us reflect on our lives for a long time, and, hopefully,""make our lives extraordinary""."
MovieAddict2016,"Jul 30, 2004",N/A,"First off let me say that I am not particularly fond of this sort of film. I feel that it has been done over and over and over again, since the major success of the formula with this film. We've seen THE EMPEROR'S CLUB, MONA LISA SMILE, SCHOOL OF ROCK, SISTER ACT, and many other rip-offs (some good, most poor) that fail to establish the warmth of this one.That's the problem -- DEAD POETS SOCIETY is all gooey; all warmth. It's well-made, and I can certainly understand why some might love it. But for me it's a bit too controlling and sentimental. Most of the characters are cliches. I had a hard time ""getting into"" the movie, and once I did, I'll admit that it became interesting -- but it's not gripping at all. It takes focus.Which is a good thing I suppose. I'm a fan of gentle, soft epics -- but this one is sugar-coated a bit too thick. It comes across as utterly unconvincing and, at times, yes, even annoying.For some reason most comedians feel they need to prove to the world that they can act. With Robin Williams, the problem is that he's not a particularly great actor, mainly because every time we hear him speak we're reminded of his early days as a comedian. There's something generally funny about the guy.I love GOOD WILL HUNTING but have a hard time taking him seriously most of the time. Every time he opens his mouth I feel like I'm supposed to laugh or something. Him playing a serial killer in INSOMNIA is admirable, but at the same time, rather laughable. He's just not the sort of guy who would have ever gotten a career through acting -- even his voice sounds comedic, and when he tries to play serious characters, he has a hard time controlling himself (see this for proof -- he's constantly acting like a hyper-active man-child).So...the acting is great and Williams DOES give a good performance, but I have a hard time taking him seriously. Peter Weir is a great director but essentially I just feel he layered this one a bit too thick with controlling, contrived sentimentality.It's a shame.NOTE: I am in no way suggesting that you will not like this movie, and am not bashing it. Don't feel the need to send me hate letters -- I recommend this film to anyone who thinks they might enjoy it. However, if you ""know"" it's not your sort of movie, chances are you WON'T like it. I liked it, but didn't love it, and had a hard time focusing most of the time, mainly because I felt distanced from what was happening.I was watching it with a girl who said, ""This is such a guy's movie,"" and left the room in disgust. Ironically I was just thinking the opposite -- ""this is such a 'chick flick'.""So I got to thinking...if this is a film targeted towards guys -- which it obviously is (it covers all ground of male trials and tribulations)...then why is it so damned ""gooey""?And as a final reflection...how on earth did this get 38,000 votes from IMDb users? I understand that it's a famous film, regarded as a well-made ""classic"" of its genre...but honestly I thought I'd see about 17,000 - 21,000 votes. 38,000 votes is close to the amount THE LORD OF THE RINGS: RETURN OF THE KING had last time I checked. THE TERMINATOR is only 12,000 ahead, and between the two, which do YOU see referenced more in pop culture?Anyway...this is a poor review, so don't send me any hate mail -- I already know...Great acting only makes this worth recommending."
steven-kelly-317BRitish,"Nov 21, 2024",7/10,"Robin Williams plays a professor of poetry, John Keating at the prestigious Welton School, with a management making sufficient hay with the schools continual academic shine. His particularly unorthodox methods of teaching soon make one realize that poetry is not something to do with rhyming words or fantasy lands, but that poetry is in effect a direct means to ones disposition in life, a disposition which would ring success in all avenues. His students soon change their very outlook towards life indulging in activities much to the displeasure of the academically unbending deans of the school. Harvesting discontent against Keating, the deans soon latch on to the one opportunity(or mis-opportunity I must say) that comes their way in the form of Neils death to see the removal of Keating from the school and the teaching profession. The last few minutes celebrate every individualistic spirit to let you segue into a illusive reality. A young Ethan Hawke playing an even younger student redeems his professors every drop of sweat with ""Oh Captain! My Captain!"""
frankde-jong,"Mar 18, 2023",7/10,"Central in ""Dead poets society"" is the Welton academy. A high school for the rich and very rich that is supposed to prepare his pupils for renowned universities like Yale and Harvard. In this proces a teacher putting emphasis on independent thinking is not very welcome. John Keating (Robin Williams in a brilliant performance) is such a teacher, loved by his pupils, hated by the management of the school. In this sense ""Dead poets society""tells two stories. The story of the relationship between Keating and the management and the story of the relationship between Keating and his pupils.From the story of the relationship between Keating and the management we learn that the management is not the ""bad guy"", at any rate not the ultimate ""bad guy"". What the management is doing is in fact in accordance with the wishes of the parents. At the end of the day it is mainly the parents who want their children to learn well without asking critical questions.The relationship between Keating and his pupils is more complicated and I think the film gives a rather one-sided picture of this relationship. Are his pupils really interested in poetry or more in rebellion and adventure? Do the ""followers"" of Keating reallu think independently or is a new form of group think evolving?"
k-13272-86913,"Sep 4, 2022",9/10,"Another time to watch a movie from 30 years ago. Why it is still fantastic? As a college student who often rewinds on her high school life, I can clearly feel with the students. Effects from one favourite teacher could be very big, even more when he's directly encouraging 'seize your day'. The students in the film do have different pursuits, and they also take tries to make them happen. The film doesn't give audience an answer how to realize your dreams, but it does inspire you to take actions at first before fertilizing daffodils. I first heard about this film in my English class, now it's been a year then I finally get to watch it. Appreciate."
brittsesier,"May 4, 2024",10/10,"""Dead Poets Society"" is a timeless film that leaves a lasting impact on its audience. Directed by Peter Weir, the story unfolds in a traditional New England boarding school during the late 1950s.Robin Williams delivers a captivating performance as John Keating, an English teacher who defies convention with his unorthodox teaching methods. With his blend of wit, wisdom, and vulnerability, Williams brings depth to the character, making Keating a memorable and inspiring figure.The film explores themes of conformity, tradition, and the pursuit of passion, as Keating encourages his students to embrace individuality and seize the day. Williams' portrayal of Keating resonates with authenticity, drawing viewers into the transformative journey of the students under his guidance.While the entire cast delivers strong performances, Williams stands out with his magnetic presence and heartfelt portrayal. His ability to infuse the character with warmth and humor makes Keating a beloved mentor figure for both the characters in the film and the audience.""Dead Poets Society"" is a poignant reminder of the importance of embracing one's passions and challenging societal norms. It's a film that stays with you long after the credits roll, thanks in large part to Robin Williams' exceptional performance."
davyd-02237,"Jun 4, 2020",9/10,"That said, it doesn't have a happy ending....this is a really well crafted film which is about the relationship between a group of privileged boys in a top notch school and their new English teacher (Robin Williams)....the head master is quite vile (Think: ""Im in charge""!)....and some of the boys parents can only be politely described as ""tyrants""....if I said more than that I would spoil it for you. We have just watched this during lockdown and apart from several times shouting at the screen, due to the injustices, it really a well presented and should be watched. I would have liked a happier ending, but that isn't what this film is actually about - watch it, see what you think - highly recommended. the Boys are all superb as is Robin Williams"
dianawannabe1129,"Oct 10, 2005",10/10,"I saw this movie in my English class two years ago. I fell in love with it. It's a tad depressing because of what happens, but there is some comic relief in the movie. It's one of the few older movies that is one of my favorite, or that I like. It's also one of two movies I saw in a class that I liked (the other one being one of the movie versions of ""Lord of the Flies""). Robin Williams is in one of his best roles as Mr. John Keating (aka 'O Captain My Captain'), and he was very inspiring to both boys and girls alike. Even though there weren't many female roles, I'm a female, and I adored this movie. So, in the words of Mr. Keating, carpe diem! Go rent this movie!"
tfrizzell,"Jul 6, 2002",N/A,"Unorthodox English professor Robin Williams (Oscar-nominated) teaches a group of boys which includes the likes of Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard the joys of life and the importance of living one's life the way one chooses in this highly over-rated film from director Peter Weir (Oscar-nominated). Williams is pretty good when he is on screen, but his air time is very minimal here. He appears and disappears at the Oscar-winning screenplay's convenience. The routine of reading poetry in a cave wears thin and the performances of many of the actors is far from being convincing. ""Dead Poets Society"" is a good film, but the way it has been honored is a classic example of overkill. From the dire cinematic year that was 1989. 4 stars out of 5."
Vampenguin,"Mar 12, 2006",7/10,"As with many High School English classes, we had to watch this over the past few days. Unlike most ""school"" movies, however, I quite enjoyed it. Robin Williams was great as usual, a pleasant change from his typical over-the-top comedy roles. He is one of my favourite actors, as he can play so many types of roles so perfectly. The supporting cast was great as well, each having their own moments to shine. The film had a very good message, to always stand up for what you believe in, and to seize the day, Carpe Diem! Part of the ending bothered me, to avoid spoilers I wont go into why, though the final scene certainly made up for it. Overall, I was pretty surprised with this movie. Who knew they'd actually make us watch something good in school!7/10"
atlasmb,"May 8, 2022",7/10,"A new English instructor comes to the prestigious boys prep school, The Welton Academy, where standards are high and discipline is an integral part of the curriculum. John Keating (Robin Williams) studied at Welton himself as a boy, and he is looking to inspire his students by asking them to think outside the box and to prioritize expression above achievement. Using poetry, he challenges them to find their artistic voices, but he may be too free-thinking for the stuffy boarding school that is so proud of its traditions.Robin Williams plays this part so well. In fact, I would have preferred that he was onscreen more. The actors who play the students are well cast. Special mention goes to Kurtwood Smith (who played Red in ""That 70s Show""); as father of one student, he has a meaty role that dominates the screen.Among the best films about teachers, ""Dead Poets Society"" ranks highly."
Gordon-38,"Apr 16, 2000",5/10,"Often when I get into a discussion of favorite movies with people I meet, they are astounded by the fact that I hate this movie.  That I loathe and despise this movie.  ""How can you hate it?"" they ask.  ""It's so inspirational!""  The only thing it inspired in me was a need to vomit.I have enjoyed much of Robin Williams' work.  I have greatly enjoyed Peter Weir's work - ""The Truman Show"" and ""Witness"" are among my favorite films. But ""Dead Poets Society"" just bothers me.  I appreciate the theme, I appreciate the idea of a teacher who inspires his students.  I just can't stand being hit over the head with it every few seconds.  I can't stand the plastic characters.But what really gets to me is this - there's a strange sense of defeatism about this movie.  As much as it would purport to advocate individuality, it seems to advocate the belief that individuality can only lead to ruin.  Take a long look at the fate of some of the major characters and think about how much the filmmakers really believe in the positive power of unconventional thinking.In the end, the whole thing just seems forced to me, I guess.  It's like the writer decided upon Point A and Point B for his characters, and simply figured out a way to railroad them all from A to B, instead of letting anything develop naturally."
Sophie-k-r,"Nov 25, 2024",10/10,This movie was an instant 10/10 from me. Normally I'm not one for movies without much action but this movie changed me. This movie was made in 1989 and directed by Peter Weir. It is meant to take place in the year 1959-1960. It is about a group of school boys who learn to rebel against the status quo and find meaning in life with the help of their new poetry teacher (played by Robin Williams).This film is heartwarming (until the last 30 minutes). I would highly recommend watching it if you have the time.Warning: you will become obsessed with it and think about it all the time and make those around you watch it...
Felix-Wackenhuth,"Oct 11, 2025",8/10,"Some movies you really feel the end coming, telling yourself ""why didn't they end earlier?""In dead poets society we follow a group of students trapped in a system where they aint able to find them self or to reach for more. I think most people in their young days are in the same position, just waiting for someone to help them reach.If i where to point some things out. Being in a group, team or somewhat society you know that everyone have their own part in that group. Take one away and everything feels somewhat different. In the movie when we follow ""the poets"" does it more feel like some people being together instead of that group. There are some that doesnt get any lines nor have any narrative or story to fill.A good movie thats compelling and keep a clear message but misses that something extra."
shahidnzahid,"Aug 7, 2025",9/10,"A terrific movie and one of the more moving and uplifting movies ever made about the meaning of life and how young minds can be moulded by inspired teaching. One of Robin Williams finer performances; with an outstanding supporting cast of young actors, especially a terrific young Robert Sean Leonard and Ethan Hawke. All of the young performers were very good and thanks to extremely good direction by the inimitable Peter Weir the movie never overwhelmed. A fine script and a very moving screenplay. A movie that has not aged since I first saw it 36 years ago. A classic!"

U will be missed."
Coolguy-7,"Jun 1, 2000",N/A,"I remember seeing this movie in my American Literature class.  It was really great.  The actors were wonderful, especially Robin Williams as the college English professor.  One part I don't understand is when one of the students played a joke on the dean.  He pretended to make the phone ring and answered it.  He then said it was God.  The dean took him into his office and literally gave him a paddling on the butt.  Don't you think college students are a little old to be treated like that?  Besides, wasn't that unlawful or had no laws about that yet been passed in the 50's?  Watching this movie also taught me one thing.  It was a famous word (actually two) called ""Carpe Diem.""  I had heard of that little phrase for several years.  Now I finally knew what it meant, ""seize the day.""  A similar incident was used in the movie ""Mrs. Doubtfire."" (also starring Williams)  Mrs. Doubtfire spilled her dentures in her water and said ""Carpe Dentum; seize the teeth.""  This is truly every English teacher's movie and I recommend it to all of them."
Spleen,"Aug 9, 1999",7/10,"Robin Williams has played a doctor, another doctor, a disk jockey, a toymaker, a loony scientist, and so on through a long list - each character somehow different from everyone else in his profession, each with a certain something that makes everyone else adore him, each obviously in possession of a huge ego, each given an opportunity to do some Robin Williams schtick, each determined to steal the movie at all costs.  He's like that here, too. So what's the difference?It's fourfold:(1)  Peter Weir is far from being my favourite director - he's capable of pretentious turkeys like ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"", for one thing - but he's not a hack.  Weir makes it worth watching in a number of ways other than those mentioned below.(2)  If you see through the Cult of Williams and notice things which escape its adherents (Keating really IS a poor English teacher; the chapter he urges his students to tear out of their books is saying perfectly sensible things and at any rate, it's a strange thing to tell them to do under the guise of getting them to ""think for themselves""; the hero-worship the students indulge in IS disturbing and unhealthy), it doesn't matter.  The central story concerns the student Neil and how he acquires moral courage. It works as a story whatever attitude we take or ought to take towards Mr. Keating.  The film is NOT just , ""Why Robin Williams is right and everyone else is wrong.""(3)  The villains ... actually, there aren't really any villains, and of the teachers who oppose Mr. Keating, one, at least, is both sensible and sympathetic.  Robin Williams has true counterweights.(4)  Robin Williams does not sweep all before him in a wave of triumph. What triumph there is muted and limited in scope.  Trust me: that's exactly what you want in this movie.  The last thing you want to see is the Cult of Keating taking over the world.""Dead Poets Society"" is a fine movie so long as not too much is claimed for it.  To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw: if you're under sixteen when you first see this movie and you don't feel that it will change your life, you have no heart; if you're over sixteen when you see it and you still feel that it will change your life, you have no head.I was sixteen exactly.  That lets me off the hook."
fcouckey,"Feb 24, 2004",3/10,"Many people think this is a great movie, but it isn't.  This movie was incredibly cliche and sappy.  The ending is so dumb I wanted to throw up.  Watch and you will see what I mean.  This movie gets an important idea wrong.  If this teacher was a great one, the students would love the poetry they were reading rather than the teacher himself.  I don't think the kids learned the greatness of the words they were reciting in the movie.  Here are some other things that bothered me:1. The students weren't good actors with the exception of Ethan Hawke 2.  The scenes where Dead Poet's Society meetings take place are horribly written. 3.  The screenplay takes every easy way out instead of finding a more clever and satisfying solution. 4.  It is full of cliches like the disapproving parent walking in through the back door during their child's big performance. 5.  The love story is stupid, pointless, and distracting. Although I liked one or two scenes, the movie dose not impress me.  If you don't agree, watch the movie carefully, and you'll realize it only tugs at your heart strings because the movie was created to do only that and not to create intelligent afterthought.  This movie is one simple, retarded, and under intelligent audiences."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Jul 10, 2020",8/10,"Dead Poet's Society (1989) :
Brief Review -This Poetic Outburst against Academic Oppress deserved Oscar more than Driving Miss Daisy. Dead Poet's Society is just not a Classic Cinematic experience but it has more to bring change and evolution in Student's life who are under terrific academic pressure. A Maverick teacher John Keating arrives in strict and disciplined boarding schood and uses poetry to embolden his students to new heights of self-expression and find thier verses. Robin Williams plays the teacher that we all wish to have at least for one seminar in our lives. His poetic thoughts are so intellectual and subversive. I wouldn't mind having such a teacher for the period of lifetime. Dead Poet's Society is also about desires and passion of Teenage boys. What they want to do in this life and how they were pressurised to do what thier parents want them to do so that they will have a sophisticated name in this civilised society. The message is important for every single soul who lives in this crazy circus called The World. Acting by Robin Williams is good but surprisingly the students i mean all them are even better. Ethan Hawke, Robert Leonard, Gale Hansen, Josh Charles look like students, they behave as one and even the rest of the cast is highly supporting. There are couple of things missed and left incomplete in the film but those were very little things so can be forgiven. Peter Weir makes a Brilliant and indulging film but more importantly he gave the right direction to outburst and to the emotions in the cilmax. I wouldn't cared about that Dead Poet's Society meeting thing set in the Cave much if it had emotions overshadowed by it. If audience voting mattered then Dead Poet's Society deserved Best Picture Oscar more than Driving Miss Daisy and i am saying with firm belief.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
paulclaassen,"Dec 6, 2018",8/10,"'Dead Poets Society' is one of the top rated films of all-time and also happens to be a multi-award winning film, and its easy to see why. This is a truly remarkable film every parent, especially, should see. Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard are exceptional in their respective roles. In fact, the entire cast were very good, and notably also Ethan Hawke.The love story between Knox and Chris felt forced and was annoying and seemingly out of place in this film. Yes, I understand the need to portray young love, since this is a coming of age film, but there was nothing romantic about them. I found it to be pure lust on Knox's behalf and Chris eventually fell for him for whatever reason. There is no chemistry whatsoever between them and the film would have been so much better without this love interest. Charlie Dalton's obsession with women was far more believable and (also) clearly lust, but suited the character and emphasized his personality.Robin Williams played a very gentle, kindhearted character, always giving advice and putting everyone else's needs before his own. He not only captures the student's attention, but also the viewer's, as he is perceived as a caring, loving person and me as the viewer felt a sense of joy as he nurtured the boys, giving them hope and inspiration - not only on a poetic level, but on life itself. It was delightful to see the boys enjoy his class and looking forward to what he had to offer.The unexpected ending shocked me to the core, for so many different reasons, and I won't spoil it for you. It caught me completely off guard. Although this is a film I probably won't watch again in a hurry (especially now that I know the ending) it definitely is a film worth viewing at least once."
theffachrif,"Nov 19, 2024",9/10,"Directed by Peter Weir from an original screenplay written by Tom Schulman, Dead Poets Society is a coming-of-age drama released in 1989. Some of you who read this probably already knew who Robin Williams was but if you don't and haven't watched any of his movies, this is a perfect introduction. You'll end up wishing that he was your English teacher at school rather than whoever it was who taught you, and I assure you, you'll never find a movie with a narrative that relates to us, students, so much as Dead Poets Society is.You know what, I've watched this movie before and decided that it was enough because I don't want to go through all of it again. As much as I like the movie, I just hate how it makes me feel after I finish watching. It's kind of a rollercoaster of emotions really. But here I am, having watched it for the second time just for the sake of writing this very review. I'm not sure if it's the writer's intention, but I think Dead Poets Society is pretty much a social commentary on every conventional school system that we know of out there. You see, teachers, particularly in school, have pretty much the exact same methods of teaching as if it were like a written rule that must be followed. Sometimes, they never let the students think freely for themselves, and the teachers wouldn't even attempt to make the lesson feel exciting. Through Williams's character Keating, the writer subtly tells us that he's exactly the kind of teacher we need. Well, John Keating is indeed the man; he guides us to chase the things that we want or our passion but can't because we are only told what to chase, and if we chase something as we please, it's wrong. Speaking of wrong, he also wants us to find our own ""walk"" no matter what others might say, to maintain our own in the face of conformity.I have only seen a handful of movies out of his entire filmography, so I wouldn't necessarily call myself a big fan of Robin Williams, but watching this movie again reminds me of what makes him one of my favorite actors (I surely need to watch more of his work). He always poured his heart out on each role, that's why he also seems very passionate about the character he portrayed. I mean, if you told me whether he was acting or not in this movie, I wouldn't even have known about it. I love how the writer sets the movie to take place during two different seasons, autumn and then we moved to winter,
at the end of the movie. Because I think it fits the overall tone and symbolizes a character or also the state of things after a tragedy occurs. Autumn is a perfect use of symbolism for the character of John Keating. He's giving this sense of warmth like none other to his students, they feel free and safe at the
same time. To them, he's more than just a teacher; he's the captain or even perhaps a father figure they should have for some boys. The visuals and cinematography of this movie are just gorgeous; it's a feast for the eyes, and they capture the beauty of autumn perfectly. You might say it's an oversimplification, well, because It is simple and beautiful.I don't care if you don't like a dialogue-driven drama; you must at least watch this kind of movie once in your life. Because It can change you, well, it does for me at least."
Hussain-AL-Naseer,"Aug 17, 2020",8/10,"One of the finest film I've come a crossed recently. Although watching it in 2020 makes its plot very familiar with Unorthodox teacher inspiring his students to make their lives extraordinary by the phrase Carpe Diem i.e. seize the day and on the contrary parents having different plans and ambitions for their children's, yet the brilliant narration and picturization makes it different from other movies still in 2020 with same idea which you'll definitely agree after watching this movie . Peter Weir's storytelling is very engaging followed by some catchy background score which ignites the emotions instantly especially in the climax scene. Robin Williams as John Keating, the Teacher narrating poetries and making it relevant to the common life struggles etc. is just brilliant, by the end of the movie you'll definitely sympathize for the character and chances are you might actually end up with tears just as I did and that defines the sheer class of Late Robin Williams.
Supporting cast i.e. the young group of students at that time not so young today were very convincing, they nailed it with their own stories and things happening around them and their connection with their teacher who once freaked them out.
Despite of some hell of the performances and smart direction, film's strongest part is indeed its writing and credit should've been given to Tom Schulman, actually credit has already been given to him as he secured Academy Award for this movie, Although the plot is familiar in 2020 but imagine 1989 when film got released pitching this kind of story for the first time ........
In the end I would conclude it by stating that film is thought provoking and hits you hard with its idea and emotional notion which it creates convincingly within 2hour and 10mins of its run time."
jackcwelch23,"Aug 30, 2017",N/A,"This movie has a lot of things going for it. Beautifully filmed in a picturesque location, with excellent performances by Robin Williams and Robert Sean Leonard. Having not seen this for years, however, some irritating flaws have made themselves known I never noticed before, such as how little Ethan Hawke is actually in it, and how underdeveloped his character is. More time seems to be given to Josh Charles seemingly pointless subplot involving him pursuing a pretty girl. Considering neither have anything interesting to say to each each other except cookie cutter love dialogue, it sort of undermined the more grandiose attempts that Robin Williams was trying to get at. Sure love makes life worth living, but portraying a love story that bland and shallow doesn't really inspire. Would have been better to have some more interactions between Todd and Keating in place of that so their relationship would be given time to grow, we learn more about them, making the conclusion hit as hard as it should. It also would have been nice for the actual meetings themselves to have more of a point and dissect and examine the poems they speak rather than getting them out of the way so they can dance and sing the night away. The intentions and the themes are good, plus the great score and the atmosphere are why this gets a 7, but in a perfect world it would have been a 10 if not for it's frustrating stumbles in the character and plot department."

Robin Williams' character was a delight, with dialogue that was as profound as it was hilarious. Probably not a good idea to watch this movie with your children...or without Kleenex."
SergeantReview,"Feb 19, 2021",8/10,"Dead Poets Society to me was just brilliant. The obvious being the amazing Robin Williams, truly great performance with a perfect balance between a comedic tone with a powerful but subtle voice. All the other actors were great also, having kids be the focul point in movies isn't always a hit but it seems back in the 80s casting was more thorough. They were all great, my favourite of the characters being Charlie Dalton, ""I'm exercising my right not to walk"". Fantastic.Without revealing spoilers, this film is not just about coming of age or rebelling against the system. A big take away for me was the story of how a great and passionate teacher can touch so many but not all of the students. How reaching and understanding young adults at such a tender age can have huge impact on their current and future lives. Shaping the men they are to become.An utterly brilliantly written story, each line of script was crafted just as eloquently as the poems they recite."
marcosbritod,"May 19, 2019",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is a beautiful drama movie that won the Best Screenplay Academy Award in 1989. The movie was written by Tom Schulman and directed by Peter Weir. Tom Schulman is graduated in philosophy and because of this the screenplay presents important reflections about the life.Robin Williams interprets John Keating, the new English teacher of a traditional school. The difference between John Keating and the other teachers of this school is the way he uses the English poetry to inspire his students to create and think by themselves. In the first class, he talked about ""Carpe Diem"", a Latin expression that means seize the day.John Keating is an important character, but the students are the focus of the plot. The poetry change the relationship between themselves and their families. Some students who were oppressed by their parent plans and expectations stars to plan their own dreams and to live their own loves.The Dead Poets Society is like an art and philosophy's manifest. It is a sensitive and necessary movie to be watched in nowadays. The utilitarian ideology doesn't recognizes the value of the poetry, the romance and the love, but these things give meaning and purpose to our lives, help us to see the world in a different way. We can't live without it!"
isaacn-46,"Aug 16, 2025",10/10,"A perfect film is defined by its characters, and ''Dead Poets Society'' offers some of cinema's most memorable. Robin Williams delivers a career-defining performance as Keating, blending warmth, wit, and quiet intensity. His portrayal avoids cliché, making Keating neither a saint nor a martyr but a flawed yet deeply compassionate mentor.The students are equally compelling. Neil's tragic arc-his artistic passion crushed by paternal oppression-is heartbreaking, while Todd's journey from self-doubt to defiance provides the film's emotional payoff. Even secondary characters, like the rebellious Charlie (Gale Hansen) and the lovestruck Knox (Josh Charles), leave lasting impressions. The ensemble cast makes the audience feel as though they, too, are part of the Dead Poets Society."
sammousseau,"Aug 26, 2025",9/10,"I can't believe it took me this long to watch this masterpiece. An absolutely beautiful film with some of the most deftly written monologues I've ever heard. It's backed by an undeniable human touch from Peter Weir's direction, intimate cinematography, and wonderfully complex characters, each given their own passions, motivations, flaws, backstories, and tragedies. How each character manages to be as complex as they are is breathtaking. And of course, every cast member gives an astonishing performance. They're all lived-in, but Robert Sean Leonard, Ethan Hawke, and especially Robin Williams are the true standouts. Williams is unforgettable in one of his best roles that reminds me of how much the world needs him now and how much I wish he was still here. I took some issue with the ending, but other than that, this is a remarkable feat of emotional storytelling."
rsterr,"Mar 3, 2003",N/A,"I stayed up late last night to watch this again; I'm paying but a small fatigue price for it today...I find the varying comments on the movie interesting, and somewhat amusing, noting the wide variance in the assessments. I would say it's not the best movie I've ever seen, but then again I'd be hard put to say what is. Suffice to say it's well worth whatever time is spent in the viewing. A few niggling things about it, however...I find it hard to imagine such an obvious iconoclast as Keating being hired at this school, given the pains taken with its stodgy identity, and Neil's character showed a remarkable weakness for a putative leader of an 'offbeat' group. His father, as well, was so one dimensional as to strain belief; why would he object so strenuously to his son's acting, if (as stated) it didn't affect his other schoolwork? And Knox's silly little love affair...why was this given so much play? Finally, Neil's ultimate solution to his problem was, well, not too credible, for a teenager with his entire life ahead of him. On the plus side, there's the emergence of Tod from his sheltered cocoon, and his rallying the boys for one last (albeit empty)defense of their mentor...a scene which I found gut wrenching. Some have commented on the boys' timidity in not standing up for Keating earlier, but the film made clear the futility of that, given the power of the parents/administration vis a vis a group of idealistic youths. For what it's worth, I urge anyone who hasn't seen this movie to do so, and to prepare to be moved, regardless of the cynic within you..."
Baderalmosawii,"Aug 16, 2025",10/10,"Dead Poets Society is a film that truly captures the heart of what teaching should be. It shows that education is not just about memorizing facts or following rules, but about inspiring students to think for themselves and see the world in new ways.As an English teacher, I was deeply touched by how the story celebrates curiosity, creativity, and the courage to be different. It reminded me that real teaching is not about controlling students, but about guiding them to discover their own voices and passions.What makes this movie so powerful is the way it encourages both teachers and students to step outside the box. It's a reminder that learning should spark excitement and push us to look at life from fresh perspectives.This film is more than just a story, it's a message about the importance of teaching with passion and about the lifelong impact that one teacher can have. Inspiring, moving, and unforgettable."
messiah-square,"Jan 29, 2005",7/10,"i myself am a person who is hopelessly trying to turn friends from mainstream music and film, etc and to my delight this film encapsulates that whole idea, i particularly enjoyed hearing robins character give opinions on conformity and his quote from a poem about choosing the path less travelled, don't get me wrong this film has a slightly ""geeky"" feel to it but if you look past the extremely ""square"" characters you will find a kinship that is remarkable and the messages it sends out are that which is poignant and true, if you can look past the faults in this film you may just look past the ""faults"" in your own life and find this film as life changing as a great song or novel."
JayW27,"Aug 18, 2025",10/10,"What a beautiful, deep and inspiring movie. The whole movie feels like an incredible adventure, teaching us multiple lessons along the journey and showing us different perspectives on life. Mr. Keating, played by the legend Robin Williams, teaches the kids, and the audience that we should be free in our choices and beliefs, to not limit ourselfs to what we are being taught but also believe deeply in what we think and feel. Contradicting to the school, which is very strict, and tries to teach kids traditionally. But trough Mr. Keatings influence, we can see that his method of teaching reaches much deeper in the hearts of these young men, changing their entire beliefs and what they stand for. This is a classic example of man vs society. They become more daring, and more passionate, they finally start living their life. But we can also see the affect that parents have on their children. The writing is incredibly well done, and the actors execute the script phenomenally. The chemistry between the young actors is really good and the acting is also very natural and realistic, this builds a sense of relatability and just pulls you into the story even further. Even now, in 2025 I can relate to the circumstances these boys are in, they are young and want to do good in life, making their parents proud, but they also want to enjoy life and mess around too, they did an amazing job of showcasing the freedom that kids take advantage of, which was really nice to see aswell. Even the more regular shots, like the new dead poets, just hanging out in the cave, just so natural and refreshing to watch. This is a classic and will always be up there. What a story."

You can not hate this man in anything. He is always so great, and unpredictable, and believable. I've had teachers like his character in the past that left marks on the way I live my life. They weren't as funny though! HahaThe acting overall from everyone in this film is strong. The casting team did a spot on job. Robert Sean Leonard as the long thespian, and Ethan Hawke are perfect.

cricketbat,"Aug 23, 2023",7/10,"Dead Poets Society is a film that has ingrained itself in popular culture. Certain phrases and moments have continued to echo through the air years after it was released. Robin Williams really is the shining star of this movie, as his warmth and passion for learning make him the teacher everyone wants to have. However, much like poetry, Dead Poets Society may not appeal to some. It's a slow and somber film, with only brief moments of slight levity provided by Williams, and it can definitely sway into the melodramatic. Still, it's an impactful story, and it stays with you long after you watch it."

mccourtney-anthony,"Jan 22, 2024",7/10,"The film chooses aspects of life that are forever important and meaningful. The way Robbie Williams portraits the teacher is not what I expected but in the end it makes sense. The director shows us the problems and struggles of life including: having your own opinion, being free and happy. The theme of poetry makes the movie beautiful and philosophical. I love movies that make you thing and reflect upon life. With this movie, you can stop and talk for hours with your wife/husband about suicide, death, non conformism, teaching, sexism and so many other interesting topics. Please watch and enjoy."
djbeardpaperclip,"Dec 13, 2024",3/10,"A rather sentimental tale of idealised characters in a highly contrived context. It's neither realistic nor believable, but that's not really the point. It's a film for the romantics and those who like to feel a tug on the heartstrings; for those who will enjoy the weepy ending.If you can go with it, then the film will serve up the kind of drama you enjoy, but others will find this film far too sickly and sweet.A harsh judgement may be that the film failed on its own terms. Ultimately the pupils fail to demonstrate the ability to think independently, to act for themselves, to develop their own critical faculties. They absorbed the mush they were spoon fed, and rolled over at the first opportunity to face the challenge."
KritikaM-0,"Apr 5, 2025",9/10,"Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"" unfolds in the orthodox setting of Welton Academy, an all-boys prep school. The film centers on a group of students impacted by their unorthodox English teacher, John Keating, played by Robin Williams, who inspires the students to think and speak for themselves, which later empowers them to defy oppressive institutional and social standards. This movie also emphasizes how fragile dreams are in a society that demands conformity.The screenplay is incredibly thought-provoking and balances the moments of self-discovery and the reality of the challenging traditions. Through Mr. Keating, the boys find the long-buried courage to break free from those traditions and take control of their own lives. As the students follow their path of defiance and independence, they are constantly reminded that not every soul who seeks the sky is allowed to fly. Keating's teachings successfully shook the ground of a conservative institution, but he failed to win the battles against his internal conflicts, leaving the audience heartbroken. The portrayal of contrast yet similarity in the emotional turmoil between Neil Perry, a ""perfect"" student torn between his love for acting and his controlling father, and Todd Anderson, who lacks a sense of belonging in Welton, is compelling as it is one of the most tragic arcs of the movie. The film revolves between joy and pain, offering humor and sorrow, with every character pulling on our heartstrings with their infectious enthusiasm and character development. The film's cinematography complements the storyline and the narrative using shots of the oppressive school grounds and strict instructors that contrast with intimate moments of freedom and growth of the students, which makes the film deeply impactful.However, the narrative overtly romanticizes the portrayal of Keating's teaching methods, while the film does not fully explore the consequences of his radical approach to teaching. This one-sided view of Keating's methods slightly overlooks the broader consequences of such a teaching style in a highly controlled institution like Welton. Additionally, the school's administration is depicted as one-dimensional beings, particularly the headmaster, who is shown as unyielding, leaving little room for understanding their perspective and thoughts while they are against Keating's teaching methods. This reduces the potential of the storyline due to a lack of the authority vs. Individual freedom conflict, making it feel a bit more one-sided than necessary.Despite these flaws, Dead Poets Society is a must-watch for anyone who has ever questioned societal expectations or felt a lack of sense of belonging. The film is timeless and will resonate with audiences long after they've watched it. This is a comforting film for anyone who feels lost. It reminds us that it's okay to be different and follow our path, even when the world feels overwhelming.

uaminen,"Aug 10, 2025",10/10,"The theme of freedom not by rebellion and destruction but by imagination and believing words could change the world, what catches my eyes more than everything is there is way to thrive in a system that suffocates creativity and imagination under the disguise of order and this show to be able create something beautiful you don't have to oppose establishment but learn to live free in it by seeing things from different angles and the friendship that exists among them empowers this and they push each other to experience something important that overlooked after too much emphasis of accomplishing alone in modern days. This gives me hope to see how valuable imagination and friendship could be:)"
spiritmonger-57550,"Aug 24, 2025",10/10,"One of the best of all times.It commemorates the importance of transforming the lives of those around us, in a positive way, opening their heads and hearts, giving them the courage to be themselves, to face the world with its truth and authenticity.Deep emotions and eternal learning.One of the best ways to remember Robin Williams and his input on and off the screen."
rooee,"May 15, 2011",7/10,"In the heart of more prolific days, Peter Weir directed this bold anti-establishment gem, starring a conspicuously reined-back Robin Williams as the unorthodox English teacher John Keating - a name that sounds like a poet's, to match the man's passion for the passion of individual will. Williams would do more nuanced, angrier work in Good Will Hunting eight years later, but this was the movie that showed the world he was more than Mork.The real star of the show is Robert Sean Leonard as the tragic trickster Puck (AKA Neil Perry), whose father can't afford for him to fail, but who cannot live without his thespian dream. With a luminescence reminiscent of Jim Carrey (who would take the titular lead in possibly Weir's finest, The Truman Show), Leonard beautifully portrays the joy and agony of personal expression's vital extremes.As usual, Weir's aesthetic is classic yet distinct, never bellowing for attention but occasionally coming alive to provide an indelible image: a bicycle sending a wave of birds into the sky; a shy student spinning in a poetic trance; a tiny lost figure stumbling onto a frozen harbour.Maurice Jarre's ugly synth score is slightly jarring (no pun intended), but Weir is on hand to furnish his soundtrack with a series of well-chosen classical pieces, most memorably two Beethoven excerpts, including the possibly divine ""Emperor"" second movement, which helped burn Picnic at Hanging Rock into our brains.There's little subtlety in this Society, but there is a wealth of humanity and truth, and a boundless idealism, amounting to another fine fable in the canon of a modest auteur."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 20, 2025",8/10,"Peter Weir's ""Dead Poets Society"" is a deeply affecting and thought-provoking film that beautifully explores the transformative power of education and the courage to forge one's own path. Robin Williams delivers a career-defining performance as John Keating, an unorthodox English teacher who inspires his students to ""Carpe Diem"" - seize the day - challenging the rigid conformity of their elite boarding school. I found myself profoundly moved by the students' journey of self-discovery, beautifully portrayed by the young cast. The film masterfully balances moments of soaring inspiration with poignant tragedy, highlighting the risks of intellectual freedom. Critics often praise its powerful message about individuality and artistic expression, alongside its emotional depth and Williams's charismatic portrayal.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. It's a timeless story that resonates with anyone who has ever questioned conformity or sought inspiration to live authentically. A definite must-see."
KFL,"Apr 14, 2001",7/10,"DPS has a number of very good scenes; the ""carpe diem"" scene near the beginning, and Todd's impromptu meditation on a photo of Walt Whitman, come to mind. Unfortunately these and other less brilliant scenes add up to something which as a whole isn't as satisfying.As others have said, by the end of the movie these boys have gained affection for their teacher, not for poetry. In the course of a semester, I suppose a couple of extraordinary (...ahem) classes, in which the boys are told to stand on their desks, walk around the courtyard, etc, would not pose a problem...given that they spent the rest of the time reading, discussing, and perhaps writing poetry. We don't see much of that, though. ...why is it that Robin Williams always has to do a John Wayne impression? He does it here, he did it in Mrs. Doubtfire, and Good Morning Vietnam, and in The Birdcage. He's very good, of course, but...enough already.The scenes in the cave...ridiculous?? Of course! Weren't you ridiculous when you were 17?This is worth seeing for a number of inspired and moving scenes; but taken as a whole, the movie doesn't work quite as well. Still worth seeing; but too flawed to be called great."
flashmickeys,"Jul 11, 2005",3/10,"To see this movie really made me angry and to be honest it made me scared. The teenagers depicted in this movie act like 9 year olds meeting a clown for the first time (Mr Keating). The laugh and cheer at his every move, they swallow everything he tells them and they run around and say ""carpé diem"" like it was the hippest expression since ""thats tits"". The directing is bland and uninspiring and the acting is even though good in one way completely realistic (I blame this on a crappy script though rather than the actors).I wan't Robin Williams to play something else than creepy super friends with tons of hilariousness at his hands and I think ""One hour photo"" is the right way to go in the future because seeing him like this again would seriously aggravate me."

preppy-3,"Feb 15, 2004",10/10,"In the late 1960s, John Keating (Robin Williams) comes to teach at a prestigous prep school.  His unconventional teaching ways (and his telling them to ""carpe diem""--seize the day) have some strong effects on his students--in particular; Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen) who hates the school; Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) who is helplessly in love with a girl; Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) who is painfully shy and Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) who wants to be an actor despite his father's (Kurtwood Smith) refusal. This all leads to a predictable conclusion.Let's get my complaints out of the way--the story is predictable (how it won an Oscar for Best Screenplay is beyond me) and the tragic turn late in the story is really not needed.  I also didn't believe the final sequence for one second. Also I kept getting the feeling that this was made just to win Oscars.  That aside, this is a great film.It IS predictable but still is well-written, well-acted and well-directed. Williams (justly nominated for Best Actor) is great.  He tones down his usual over the top personality and underplays his part very nicely.  The teaching sequences with his students are great--a really good one was when he teaches Hawke how to ""write"" a poem.  Also his ""carpe diem"" became a catch phrase for years afterwords.  Hansen is also very good as Dalton as is Charles as Overstreet.  Hawke (who i usually hate) was surprisingly good as Anderson and Leonard is just exceptional as Perry--every time he was on screen I couldn't take my eyes off him.  He's one hell of an actor.  Also Smith is totally evil as a domineering father.  Basically, nobody is bad and they say all their lines with conviction.  Even though I saw everything coming I didn't care--the acting was so good I couldn't stop watching.The direction by Weir is great.  Two sequences stand out--when Williams is teaching Hawke about the poem and when three of the boys are chasing each other around a room.  Also there are some really beautiful sequences such as the winter ones and when the boys go out in the dead of night for ""society"" meetings.  Incidentally Dead Poets Society is the boys getting together in a cave late at night and reading poetry or telling tall tales to each other. Sounds strange, but it works in the context of the movie.I'm giving this a 10--I just wish I could get rid of those lingering doubts about WHY this picture was made...I wish it was for the story and the acting, but I don't think it was."
mts43,"Apr 7, 2023",8/10,"I attended a military school in 1962. Aside from the military aspects. It was no different than Welton. They demanded conformity. They told everyone what they wanted them to think, and how to behave. I hated just about every minute that I was there, which fortunately was less than one school year. I later served in the real military -- remember, this is when there was still a Draft. Military school was nothing like the ""real thing"". While I found this film to be too slow-paced at times, it is still well worth watching. Some of the most chilling performances are by the the ""bad guys"", specifically those portrayed by Norman Lloyd and Kurtwood Smith. The story certainly explains why the 60's experienced such a profound social revolution. That was the Baby Boomer Generation -- which later turned its back on much it had struggled to change. ""Deja Vu all over again""."
ExtremeCloseUp,"May 31, 2024",N/A,"Dead Poets Society hits you like a truck. It is so powerful that it will move you, inspire you, make you think. Exactly what Professor Keating (Robin Williams) did to his students. ""Boys, you must strive to find your own voice"" and of course ""Carpe Diem"" are two phrases that capture the essence of his philosophy. In other words, find your passion and go for it without wasting your time on what society or the rules consider right. From that moment on, his students' lives are changed forever. Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard) wants to become an actor, Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke) wants to overcome his insecurity and come to terms with himself, Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles) wants to capture the heart of a girl he met and Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), perhaps the most committed practitioner of Mr. Keating's teachings, wants to turn the world upside down and in the meantime have as much fun as possible. Another great thing about it is that it shows both sides of the coin, namely that even if you get in this state of mind, life works in mysterious ways and there are no guarantees of success or happiness, reality can crush you at any moment. All in all, it's hard to judge Dead Poets Society purely as a movie, it's more of a life experience."

The truth is, the opening and closing scenes were both inspirational and emotionally gripping. However, there were many loopholes in between that could bore the audience.While I wouldn't consider this movie as outstanding as emotional films like Into the Wild or The Bucket List, I also wouldn't call it average, because it honestly isn't. For me, this movie is a solid 6/10."

It hits all the beats, the clichés, the heartstrings... but to me, it's just going through the motions to get through it.No complaints and Williams did a fine job. Actually, all the actors did. If you liked this movie about finding your inner voice among conforming rules in a boarding school, so be it.That's it. That's all I have to say. I only saw this once before, probably 25-28 years ago and felt the same back then. I added to the list now hoping it would inspire me, or I'd see it in a new light and rejoice!Nope. I'm still: eh. Okay, seize the day - don't conform!I'm way past that in my own life. I guess I have other past progressive people/teachers to thank for that. So. Thanks!"
makayhart,"Feb 3, 2023",10/10,"There haven't been very movies that I genuinely feel changed my life, and Dead Poets Society is most definitely one of them. This movie really made me understand the importance of living by the phrase ""carpe diem."" I think all of the guys in Dead Poets Society are relatable to many in their own way, which I think is one of the reasons why this is such a widely adored film; people can see how someone can struggle to live life to the fullest, but they wish to do so anyway. Todd Anderson was my favorite character. I really related to him in terms of his anxious personality, but in the end, learning to be comfortable in himself and his own decisions. I think Neil Perry is extremely relatable to the masses due to his ""unrealistic"" dreams. I've known so many people, and have also myself, wanted unrealistic realities. I think that both these characters are really important to both myself and for so many people, especially adolescents. I think it's important to learn how to embrace yourself, the draw backs to doing it, and the drawbacks to not doing it. I think this film can really inspire some people to live the life they always wanted, and to really embrace the meaning of carpe diem."
gbill-74877,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"Robin Williams, Ethan Hawke, and Walt Whitman ... that's a trinity I can get behind. This is such a beautiful, stirring film to me. The messages of carpe diem, of finding the beauty in the poetry of the world, and of expressing oneself instead of conforming to others are profound, and I could watch the unconventional teaching methods all day.The central struggles are of a student (Robert Sean Leonard) trying to pursue his dream in spite of a domineering father, another (Josh Charles) trying to win a young woman's heart in spite of how unrealistic it seems, and a third (Hawke) trying to find his voice in spite of his introversion and having grown up in the shadow of his very successful older brother. All of them are trying to get through prep school, but a new teacher makes them see the world and path they're on a little bit differently. Director Peter Weir told this story very well and got every bit of emotion out of it.The film hits me even harder because I once had a teacher in the same vein as John Keating (Robin Williams). It was for a class called Prose Literature, one that I found myself in completely by accident, and which ended up being the most influential class in my life. After what I thought was a fantastic year, the teacher ran afoul of conservative school officials, got fired, and the case eventually went to court, where I and some other students were called to testify. We stood up for him, perhaps not as dramatically as that extraordinary 'O Captain, My Captain' moment in this film, and he was acquitted/reinstated. I'm not sure where he is now in this world, but this film makes me wish I could tell him how important he was to me."

To give a movie a 10/10 is to imply that this movie moved me, that it changed my perspective on something, that it left me wondering and still thinking about it hours after watching it. When I first watched this movie, I had no clue what it was about. To be honest, it had no value to me. I read the description and I almost clicked away but something drew me to this movie. This movie never ceases to make me cry and leave me in a trance, and for that it gets a 10/10.

Just when I thought negative leadership was going to end the movie, it turned a different way to where nobody will ever forget the true meaning of sticking by each other through thick and thin. The way these students were treated was so absurd. I don't know how any student could learn. Robin Williams was exquisite in his teaching methods to the kids, and by treating them the way they should be treated in a unique way made the movie extraordinary. Also, because of the professor,the group of friends started to show their talent, and believed in themselves for the very first time."

schnad,"Dec 7, 1998",9/10,"After hearing nothing but praise from my friends and family, I made the decision to rent Dead Poets Society.  Although it was hyped-up a lot by my friends, I tell you that I was not the least bit disappointed.  This film lived up to the hype and then some.  I'm not gonna waste my time summarizing this film, cause chances are anyone who is reading this has already seen the film.  So instead I'm going to briefly touch on the impact this film had on me as an individual.  Carpe Diem (sieze the day).  That pretty much sums up the feeling that this film instilled in me after viewing it.  It made me realize that there are more important things in life than just following ""tradition"" and doing what is expected of you.  It showed me that I must follow my own path in life, with what makes me truly happy, rather than conform with what is expected of me.  Also, I don't think I have ever been so touched by a single scene in a movie like I was with the final scene in this movie.  When you could see the guilt in the eyes of the Ethan Hawke character, knowing that he was partially responsible for Mr. Keating's dismissal.  You could tell he just wanted to tell Mr Keating how much he meant to all of his friends and him.  And you could also see the forgivness in the eyes of Robin Williams, knowing that the boys were not to blame, but rather the ""establishment"".  And when Mr. Keating was just about to leave the classroom for the last time, and Ethan Hawke jumped up on his desk and addressed Mr Keating ""Captain, My Captain!""... I literally wept out loud.  I have never cried during a movie like I did with this one.  I literally bawled that entire scene (when the students stood up on their desks), and didn't stop until half-way through the final credits.  Anyone that enjoys being moved and touched by a movie MUST see this one.  It will also add two important words to your vocabulary.... CARPE DIEM."
Christopher_Reid,"Aug 14, 2025",7/10,"I have very mixed feelings about this movie. Maybe I need more time to process it. But also, maybe I should trust my instincts and state my conclusion: the movie itself is very mixed and ambiguous. It has good and bad qualities. I fear some people adore it for the very reasons I find it disappointing.Let's start with the acting. The acting is very good. You have Robin Williams in his prime in a relatively serious role, a young Ethan Hawke, various young actors who are very convincing and emotive in their roles. This is the main strength of the movie and why it stays with you. I cared about the characters and what they were going through. I saw a lot in their eyes. The movie takes its time and really lingers on their facial expressions. The characters go through stressful experiences and we get a lot of emotions and things to process.Having said that, the messaging of the movie is quite mixed and possibly too simplistic, sugar-coated or even irresponsible. Let's take the main phrase Carpe Diem, meaning Seize the Day. It is inspiring, certainly. But inspiration to do what, exactly? To jump off a bridge? As cliched as that example is, we use it for a reason. Teenagers hardly need the encouragement to ""seize the day"". Maybe that means trying drugs, stealing, cheating, defying parents. It's very risky advice.That's part of my problem with the movie. I'm a teacher myself. If only I had students as focused as the ones in this movie. So quiet and attentive. Seldom does that happen. Clearly it's set at some kind of elite, private school. But that should be valued. Let's not shun discipline, tradition, study, etc. Those values exist for a reason.So while I do like Robin Williams a lot as the teacher, he's very funny, charismatic, energetic, etc. The thing is, we don't see him teach much specific stuff. And the other teachers are treated as stiff, 1-dimensional villains. What, because they teach in a strict, conventional way? Doesn't that work though? Are the parents paying for their kids to learn maths, literature, history, etc., or so their kids develop a lot of self-esteem, maybe an overload of self-esteem, and try new things, even risky and dangerous things? Or to develop unrealistic dreams and goals which take away from critical study time?I suppose the movie technically keeps this open for us to draw our own conclusions, but it could have used more nuance. We see Williams clarify that there's a difference between being brave and stupid but only once and we rarely see how the other teachers do things. The movie seems to treat all rules and discipline as bad. The boys smoke. Is that good for them? Is that a part of seizing the day?At worst, the movie seems to support vague, general hedonism, carelessness, don't bother with study or hard work, just be loud and obnoxious. It reminds me of young political activists who disrupt people from studying maths, science, engineering and other hard subjects, in favour of the latest chants and slogans for some political movement.Had the movie delved into the distinction between rules, conventions, habits, etc., which are necessary to learn and build a good society, vs. Rules which shut down minds and take away freedom, that would have been more insightful. But we get little analysis of that difference.The movie starts to veer in one direction towards the end and I found this a bit limiting and frustrating. The other subplots were quite interesting but they take a backseat. The trope of the overcontrolling father vs. The son desperate for freedom to do other things, like acting, is a bit tiresome. And the lack of nuance is frustrating. For example, the son is getting straight A's. Surely even the most stubborn father could allow him some freedom at that point. I think that would make a reasonable compromise. As long as your marks meet a certain standard, you're allowed to do X, Y and Z.I do have to admit, as soon as I saw the play the son was in, I laughed and thought I actually might side with the father. He looks like a tree. He's wearing leaves. The costume looks ridiculous. And the Shakespearian dialogue feels silly as well. You really do start to see the dad's point of view. While I'm half-joking, it feels like a weird choice on the part of the filmmakers. If the boy's passion is acting, at least let him perform something that looks dignified and professional. It looks very amateurish in the movie which undermines the seriousness it's meant to carry.I also disliked what felt like cliches throughout the movie. The way Robin Williams has the full attention of his class and has these beautiful moments with them. It feels artificial and false. While I joke a lot with students, sometimes give little speeches, make them laugh or put them on the spot, there's also a lot of very dry explanations and repeated examples and hard work. There is firm feedback.Again, to be clear, I liked Williams' character and his warmth and way of treating his students - the way he gains their respect - but I didn't like that the movie treated all of his lessons like bizarre, wonderful life-changing adventures. That's how you get egotistical political activists with their heads in the clouds. Sometimes, you need to come back to simple, concrete things. It could be anything from defining words to analysing poetry, giving feedback on student work, etc. Not constant magic lectures.The movie feels like it ends too abruptly. Maybe this is an effective choice - part of why it stays with you. But maybe it's just lazy. I wanted to know what happens next. The lack of an answer is frustrating. And it's especially annoying when obvious points to me aren't brought up by any of the characters. For example, you can hate the father all you want, but isn't he paying for his son's education? How old is the son? If he wants to do acting, can't he do that later? Can he work and save up money?Again, if his marks are good, why not let him spend his free time however he wants? And, as I've emphasised, why not break down why rules exist in the first place? How do we distinguish between brave choices to do bold, new things vs. Being a loud, self-centred jerk? What's the difference between a high quality, strict school with impeccable behaviour and results but happy students vs. A miserable school where students lose all humanity and become vessels for memorising bland facts and regurgitating the opinions fed to them? Where's the balance between patient, diligent hard work vs. Playing and exploring? The movie doesn't really offer much insight, merely implying that one extreme is bad, ignoring that the other extreme is perhaps even worse!There's the concept of ""thinking for yourself"" and yet we rarely see anyone think. None of those key arguments are brought up. I'd settle for anyone thinking, teacher or student!Anyway, this is still a good movie, just one which veers into sentimentality and a contrived, ambiguous message. It could have been really special. And it does certainly have impact. Robin Williams is very memorable. The students are memorable. There's much to be said for the bravery of standing up to authority. But the risk is that people don't know when or why to do that and some people will celebrate this as having the message of do whatever you want, eat the rich, knock over cars, set things on fire, kiss a girl without permission, etc. Not a message you want to risk conveying. Still, it was clearly thought-provoking for me. I just don't know if Peter Weir thought about this stuff."
m_madhu,"Mar 11, 2002",8/10,"dead poets society is a movie ive been wanting to watch for a long time. finally made it and was pleasantly thrilled. the movie is wonderfully touching, with deft sensitive handling and an inspiring storyline.the first half of the movie is wonderfully inspiring and elevating, though the latter half breaks down slightly and does get  a little trite and cliched. though the magic of the movie is strong and effective. its beautifully scripted and the performances are very real and believable. robin williams as the teacher who impels his students to ""seize the day"" is excellent.the movie is a must-watch for all dreamers and lovers of the arts - it is wonderfully heart-warming. and it has a lot of curiosity value as well, especially seeing ethan hawke from way back!!all i can say is ""seize the day"". watch the moviean inspiring 8!"
maddmaxx46,"Feb 6, 2025",9/10,This was such an inspirational film with gut-wrenching moments near the end. I love the message of standing up for yourself and not conforming to the norm. Robin Williams was fantastic as he's always been in his career. I also thought Ethan Hawke and Robert Sean Leonard were extremely talented in this one and you could tell it was a jumpstart to their careers. The rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job. You can slowly watch each character grow stronger throughout the film. I'd love to have my future kids watch a movie like this at such a pivotal age because I could have benefitted from seeing this one earlier. 4.5/5 stars.
maggiesnuggs-97449,"Apr 25, 2024",10/10,"I've watched the movie a few times now as Robin Williams playing Keating with a few laughs here and there is my favourite film. I had an English teacher who was very much like Keating's thinking, I always enjoyed his lessons. My brother went to a boarding school, it certainly wasn't anything like the school in the movie. I can't help thinking why the writer made Neil's father so against Neil's desire to act. Isn't it part of their growing up and adventure to do these things in school, like get a band together and put on plays, my brother certainly did both. Neil's parents were cold, his mother couldn't even put her arm around her son before going up to bed. The casting of the boys was just perfect, and the Casting Director needs congratulating for that. Hawke gave a stirling performance as did Robert Sean Leonard as the main two boys. Poor Neil he just didn't have the courage to tell his father what he wanted. Great movie, one I can watch over and over. Thankyou Robin may you RIP. I hope you knew just how much joy in your acting career you brought to us on the screen."
StevePulaski,"Dec 16, 2013",8/10,"I can look at Peter Weir's Dead Poets Society from two different lenses and come to two different conclusions based on them. The first lens sees a mawkish production, one looking to inflate its emotional climax by ways of theatrics and erect a film largely founded off of vague characters, common clichés, and quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets. I'd assign that film two stars. However, my opposite view sees the film as a production tackling themes of self-discovery and enrichment along with aspirations over obligations, utilizing quotes pulled from a broad spectrum of deceased poets to its advantage. I'd assign that film four stars. The issue is I can't see one lens at a time, without the other covering it, as everything I've stated exists in this film to some degree. I'm compromising at three stars and going from there.The story revolves around Neil Perry (Robert Sean Leonard), Todd Anderson (Ethan Hawke), Knox Overstreet (Josh Charles), Charlie Dalton (Gale Hansen), Richard Cameron (Dylan Kussman), Steven Meeks (Allelon Ruggiero), and Gerard Pitts (James Waterston), high school seniors at the prestigious prep school Welton Academy, a school boasting the typical prep school philosophy of honor, excellence, and education. It is looking to be another year of mundane lameness for the boys until they meet their English literature teacher, Mr. John Keating (Robin Williams), who preaches the philosophy of ""carpe diem"" and informs them that they may refer to him as ""O captain! My captain!"" Immediately, he touches these students in a way they've never been touched before. The class that was once a bore to them has now become an outlet for expression and personal enrichment, along with providing them with personal benefits they had never seen. The seven teens decide to secretly revive the ""Dead Poets Society,"" a club that was erected to study and preserve the teachings and the beauty of poetry written by poets who have passed away. Keating was a member of the society when he attended Welton Academy and loved it, so naturally the boys want to have a similar experience.When the boys create the society, the first thing I sort of cringed at was the way they acted. It was as if they felt they were making a difference to society in general rather than simply learning something in an institution that predicates itself off of learning in the first place. Then it hit me; that's exactly what they were doing. The beauty of Dead Poets Society is that these teenagers are actually learning and feeling like they're becoming better (or at least different) people because of it. Weir and writer Tom Schulman are specifically trying to detail the dramatic shift in thinking the boys are experiencing in school. It succeeds because we can see the difference in their actions and their way of looking at the world because of it. Consider when Todd runs outside after hearing tragic news to only stop and look at the snow falling and blanketing the grass below. ""It's beautiful,"" he says, before falling to his knees. Without Mr. Keating, he would've fallen to his knees.However, I will say that by the end of the film, Keating is left too much of an enigma. He is all too clearly a metaphor of a captain, leading his shipmates (the teenagers) to a destination much different than what they intended. That destination is unclear, but the journey provides for a change of scenery for the boys. Robin Williams gives a great performance, but he's playing a character that is all too clearly supposed to be analyzed rather than resonated with.All the teenagers do exceptional acting, especially Robert Sean Leonard as Neil, whose father (Kurtwood Smith) pressures him to no end to become a doctor or anything but what his passion wants, which is to be an actor. This is where I come back and explore another theme of the film, this time one that's rarely touched on. With all the coming-of-age films, it's a bit difficult to find one that shows parents dictating their children's live in a way that is memorable. Smith's performance as a father who appears so stubborn and dictative over his son's actions he comes off as ignorant to his son's cries for a different life is a scarcely-mentioned one, but the themes at hand here kind of overshadow it. The film handles the idea in a way that's difficult to explain, but easy, if not relatable, to view.But in addition, the mention of the film's use of theatrics and mawkishness come to mind once more. There is a tragedy that takes place in the film (attentive viewers, like myself, will see it coming long before it happens). When it does occur, the way the film handles it feels more like a way to attract tears than actual reality. The slow-motion effect doesn't help the film's case either. Everything after that scene, including the obligatory scene of appreciating the teacher's accomplishments that's tacked on at the end of the film, feels rushed.As one can infer, I'm hot and cold with this film. As an aspiring English major and a person who loves to read and appreciate poetry, I appreciate the fact that this film - if shown to adolescents - can show them that reading and analyzing can be enjoyable if taken with seriousness and a willingness to learn. However, there are times when the film strays off its unconventional themes and focus in favor of a more sentimental portrayal of impact and motivation on students.There's a truly amazing film in here, but due to the film's attitude of trying to embellish its emotional impact and leave our faces tear-stained, it's kind of deluded."
englishclass2009,"May 21, 2009",8/10,"Dead Poets Society is a drama movie which takes place in the late 1950s in the United-States. The story is set in a renowned boys-only preparatory school called Welton Academy, which is traditional, austerre and where the students are expected to be the best. A group of boys formed by Neil Perry, played by Robert Sean Leonard (who plays Dr Wilson in Dr House), Todd Anderson played by Ethan Hawke, Know Overstreet played by Josh Charles and others.There are new English teacher, Mr keating (played by Robin Williams). He's an unusual teacher as his way to teach isn't the same as the other teachers. He talks to the student about an old secret organization : the Dead Poets Society, a poets group. The Boys decide to recreate this group and it will change their lives because they'll want to seize the day and they'll learn how to think for themselves, but it's maybe not a good thing for them and Mr keating.I like this film because I love film because it's about school and relations between teachers, children and parents.The movie had the Oscar for best screenplay."
ehmashruf,"Mar 3, 2024",10/10,"This movie should be a must-watch for every man and woman who wants to become or is already a teacher. Without watching this movie, no one should start teaching. That's the ultimate truth, I believe. It offers a lifetime learning opportunity. Every word in this movie is a lesson on making difficult things work in a simple, easy way. It also sheds light on the social norms we often adhere to, even if we don't like them. Sadly, many of us still follow these norms, sacrificing our happiness.The reality is that older individuals, who may have a few years left to live, often believe they know everything and dismiss those who disagree with their perspectives as foolish or unrealistic. However, younger people can understand multiple perspectives that older individuals may not even imagine. This movie is all about learning, understanding the human mind, love, care, and nurturing our inner selves."
snoop-4,"Sep 12, 1998",N/A,"This movie is not an entertaining one, but rather, an inspiration for life, a guideline for better living and proves to me that not every movie has to rely heavily on special effects; that straight, good story-telling is still very much an important tool in a wholesome education to lead a useful life. It also serves as a nurturing ground for aspiring poets and students of literature. Every time I watch it, I am still inspired as I was the first time."
myturn21,"Jul 18, 2000",6/10,"Yes, Robin Williams is fine in this film.  However, the film as a whole is highly overrated when you consider that the remainder of the characters are underdeveloped & the story is nothing more than a cliched commentary on free thought & expression.  The only student who really stands out is Robert Sean Leonard's character, Neil.  BUT, to call this Robin William's best performance is crazy when you compare the character to Sean Maguire in Good Will Hunting. Also, I can't forgive the screenwriters for deliberately misquoting Walt Whitman."
prestocito,"Mar 11, 2021",10/10,"More meaningful and purposeful than any movie that I have ever seen, except for the Truman Show. Really shows the purpose of life and how you should live it. Also has some educational moments where you actually learn something.
If you don't have an open mind and a really low attention span, you probably wont appreciate Dead Poets Society as much as others. It all really depends on your point of view. But I think that this is a work of art"
