OttoVonB,"Jan 8, 2003",10/10,"I discovered 16 of Kurosawa's best known films before returning to the one which is commonly thought of as his masterpiece. Seven Samurai is unlike any other grand classic ever produced. It's basic plot can be summed up in a single easy sentence, yet its refinement and execution rival any movie you've ever seen.The premise: in chaotic 16th century Japan, as marauders threaten raid villages, one village hires samurai to defend it from a group of bandits. Yet Kurosawa (also co-writer) developed these characters in a way unheard of for what might pass as an epic action film. To its astonishing credit, through all of its 207 minutes running time, Seven Samurai never falters or bores. And if the script is a marvel in itself, the acting and production design than derive from it are nothing short of superlative. It is said that Kurosawa forced the villagers (from supporting role to mere extra) to live together as a community during production and be their characters, each and every one of which he had drawn out specifically. This unusual technique gave Seven Samurai a feel of authenticity unparalleled in film history.The samurai themselves are so richly given life to in the screenplay that little more would have been needed to make them memorable characters, yet the main cast pay off at every turn, and though every one of the seven main actors give in perfect performances (never as I had feared before watching it do you confuse them, even in the chaotic battle scenes), two immortal roles have a particularly resounding effect: Takashi Shimura (Kambei Shimada), who plays the leader of the ragged band of samurai, gives his sage and venerable warrior a god-like intensity that makes the magnetic charisma of his character unquestionable. One of the easiest leaders to root for in all the history of film-making. Stealing the show however, albeit by a very thin margin, is longtime Kurosawa favorite coworker Toshiro Mifune (Kikuchiyo) as the rogue seventh, the black sheep of the herd, giving the bravura ultimate performance of a lifetime paved throughout with great roles.The story follows them and the villagers, equally nuanced and developed, through their encounter, training, eventual bonding and the big inevitable fight for survival. Unlike subsequent very successful remakes (i.e. Magnificent Seven), seven Samurai transcended excellency by having many layers (nothing or no one is white or black: everything exists in shades of gray) and thus being very real and human. Even without the menace, its interpersonal dynamics would have made it perfect human drama, subtle, balancing comedy, intensity, realism, drama and a deep philosophy with astonishing ease, yet the menace does materialize and thus Seven Samurai unleashes its violence in a series of action scenes crafted with such vision and ingenuity as has ever reached an action film (the frenetic battle scenes at the end rather evoke Saving Private Ryan in their relentlessness).In the end, what made this into solid gold was, at the core, Akira Kurosawa, who would, despite directing many further masterpieces (Throne of Blood, Yojimbo, Red Beard, Dersu Uzala, Kagemusha, Ran), would never top this one. Throughout his life, Kurosawa kept confirming his status as perhaps the greatest director ever. If so, Seven Samurai is the ultimate proof of that truth. One of the very best films ever made and personal all-time favorite."
Davor_Blazevic_1959,"May 25, 2010",10/10,"Though its biblical connotation is not the happiest one (""Seven Deadly Sins"") number seven, omnipresent in our (7 days a) weekly cycles, seems to have been a lucky number in the world of cinema. Several very solid and some great movies have this number in their title, starting with gag-wise incredibly inventive Seven Chances (1925) from genius of silent era Buster Keaton, Frank Borzage's silent version of classic melodrama 7th Heaven (1927), Walt Disney's first feature-length animated movie, Snowhite and Seven Dwarfs (1940), recognized as an instant classic and remained so ever after, Stanley Donen's ear-pleasing, eye-riveting musical Seven Brides for Seven Brothers (1954), staged in western milieu, with the breathtaking barn-raising dance sequence, Ingmar Bergman's literally Death-defying, answers-to-reasons-for-human-misfortune-seeking masterpiece, Det sjunde inseglet (""The Seventh Seal"") (1957), Billy Wilder's Seven Year Itch (1957), a clever and amusing first collaboration with incomparable Marilyn Monroe (a worm-up for their second, bigger if not decisive step in taboos-of-the-motion-picture-production-code-breaking, brilliant comedy Some Like It Hot (1959)), up to newer examples like David Fincher's disturbing drama Se7en (1995), one of the finest Hollywood movies of the 90's, as well as Tsui Hark's Chat Gim (""Seven Swords"") (2005), a stunner in the department of action sequences from the often under-appreciated genre Wuxia, originating from Chinese literature.However, even among such illustrious examples of movie-making par excellence, one movie holds a special place, Shichinin no samurai (""Seven Samurai"") (1954) from the legendary Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. This movie doesn't seem to lack anything that an avid movie consumer, in particular samurai genre admirer, might be wishing for.It is not easy to say anything new about the one of the most analyzed and scrutinized movies of the film history. Nevertheless, and despite being eventually only repeated, it shall be mentioned that movie has a simple but very engaging story - a group of peasants, representing a village, periodically stormed by gang of bandits, looting their crops and other possessions, hires several wandering ronins (masterless samurai) to help them protect the village - not without lucid observations on the possibility of social interaction between members of different classes during the almost seven centuries long feudal history (1185-1868) of Japan.Characterization is excellent, and though having clear stand-outs in samurai's true leader, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), a wise tactician of the exceptional valor, as well as in the exuberantly uncontrollable Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), messy in its appearance and blustering in its manner, yet, a peasant descendant himself, making for a perfect link between the samurai and their employers, all other samurai are memorable, as well, sporting wide variety of personality traits. In joining the village protection operation, hired for nothing more than a regular meal for as long as providing a service, thus primarily hoping to finally fill their starving stomachs, each one of them was driven by different additional motives, whether they were challenged to test their bravery, fighting skills and tactics, seeking for excitement and recognition, trying to regain pride and glory of the past days, just reaching out for that human touch (cross-class communication, even mere courtship promising relationship) they have been deprived of, or simply interested in the noble cause of the ensuing campaign.Together with true highlights in realistically choreographed battle scenes, showing all the pain and misery of excessive violence on the reverse of heroism, that even defenders cannot avoid resorting to, sadly announcing inevitable decline of the samurai and their ways exposed to new artless technology, unbecomingly dying ambushed by distant shots from the muskets, while ingloriously stuck in the village muds... it all makes for a compelling narrative.[...Skip the paragraph due to possible s-p-o-i-l-e-r-s, if you care...] Though triumphant in their common task to protect the village, unlikely alliance between samurai and peasants is ultimately doomed to fail. In the short run, it gives expected results, but in the long run, does not stand the chance. That is so loudly, although in fact silently, expressed at the end, when peasants don't even care to join the surviving samurai in their mourning over the fallen ones, not even giving the last well deserved respect to those who have helped them withstand fierce attacks, prevail and ultimately defeat bandits, and, in doing so, most of them given their lives. Peasants simply continue with their daily chores, while surviving samurai have to leave the village, like they have never existed, sadly symbolizing their ultimate destiny: slowly but surely stepping off the future pages of the history books.Seven Samurai, the movie, is rightfully considered as the one that has redefined samurai film in its contemporary perception, and dawned almost two decades long string of successes, instantly becoming the brightest example of thus revived, uniquely provocative and entertaining sub-genre, unknown as such in the country of its origin, classified there within a broader genre, jidaigeki (a period drama, often describing events from pre-modern era of the Edo period, marking the governance of Tokugawa shogunate (1603-1868), relatively peaceful times for Japan's long history of civil wars, as opposed to gendaigeki, films treating contemporary matters), and by IMDb standards, as an action drama, occasionally historical, when based on real events.Originating in the Edo-era Far East, it has inspired equally successful, star-studded (Y. Brynner, S. McQueen, C. Bronson, J. Coburn, E. Wallach, R. Vaughn, H. Buchholz, B. Dexter) Hollywood remake, The Magnificent Seven (1960), conveniently situated in the U. S. West of 19th century, as well as three lesser sequels, Return of the Seven (1966), Guns of the Magnificent Seven (1969), and The Magnificent Seven Ride! (1972)."
gkbazalo,"Aug 17, 2004",N/A,"Having seen Kurosawa's Seven Samurai at least 10 times, I still see something new every time I watch it.  I don't see how anyone, especially a non-Japanese, could possibly absorb this movie in less than 2 or 3 viewings. I've always been surprised at how each of the 7 samurai can make such an individual impression on you even if you can't understand Japanese. Although Toshiro Mifune is often considered the star, for me its Takashi Shimura who is firmly fixed at the center of the movie.  He is the guiding moral force from the moment of his appearance in the film and can capture the viewer's attention in a way similar to Alec Guinness.  Mifune's character can be annoying at first in his loutish behavior, but he gains stature throughout the film and eventually becomes a unifying force second only to Shimura.  Minoru Chiaki as the woodcutting samurai provides a subtle humor and the others look to him to boost their morale.  Daisuke Kato is another very familiar face to Japanese movie fans and provides an excellent foil to Shimura as his second in command.  Yoshio Inaba is very good as the samurai who is recruited by Shimura and quickly builds a strong rapport with him.  Seiji Miyaguchi as the ""expert"" warrior, dedicated to honing his skill as a swordsman is a very low key yet likeable character.  Ko Kimura as the young hero-worshipping samurai, as well as the love interest of the peasant girl, wishes to be a great samurai, but is easily distracted by a field of flowers or a pretty face.  The peasants in the village being defended by the samurai each have their own defining characteristics as well.In addition to the wealth of interesting characters, we have a terrific action plot--the defending of the village from 40 marauding bandits by the small troop of samurai--, and a more subtle secondary plot involving the distrust of the samurai by the villagers due to the historical interaction of these two classes in feudal Japan.  All of these plot and character elements are woven together into an unforgettable epic, but, at least in my opinion, its not one that can be absorbed in a single sitting.  While it's similar in this sense to another of my favorite epics, Leone's Once Upon a Time in the West, it is more complex given the number of characters.I can only say that your patience with this film will probably be well rewarded if you take the time to give it multiple viewings.  You will also have the pleasure of seeing many of the samurai and villagers pop up in other Kurosawa films and films of other Japanese directors.  If you like Mifune and Shimura in this one, catch them in Stray Dog and Drunken Angel in very different settings and parts.This one is 10 out of 10 without a doubt."
PureCinema,"Dec 26, 1998",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece... The Japanese equivalent to Orson Welles' Citizen Kane.. I say it's just as good, if not even better. Not only Kurosawa's most well known film, but the most widely recognized Japanese film ever made. This movie will forever be known as a milestone in motion picture history.The story revolves around a village that has become a group of bandits' common looting and pillaging ground. The villagers cannot take this any longer and go to town to hire warriors to defend the village from the bandits. A wandering ronin, Kambei (Takashi Shimura) agrees to help them and with his help, they recruit six others that agree to take the job. The seven samurai teach the villagers how to stand up to the bandits and defend themselves. Finally, when the time comes, they engage in a fierce battle with the attacking bandits.About once in every 20 years or so we are gifted with a film that has the meaning, power, richness, and technique that The Seven Samurai has. I cannot urge anyone enough to see this film, the images are true cinematic poetry rich with so much emotion that I cannot even describe them in words. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa's works, then please see Seven Samurai... you will witness the true beauty, excellence and magic that the art form known as film is capable of."
SonOfaGunderson,"Feb 3, 2001",10/10,"In 1954, Kurosawa made foreign film history with Seven Samurai. Everything about this film is just absolutely terrific. The film lasts around 3 1/2 hours, and every minute of it is unbelievable filmmaking. Kurosawa's blend of stellar craft, captivating cinematography, ravishing art direction, and unforgettable characters makes this one of the most intelligent films ever made. The first hour is devoted to devoloping the many four-dimensional characters which inhabit the film throughout. When watching the film, the audiece cares for, trusts, mourns and ultimately believes every single attribute the characters have. Samurai set up the way that many action films are made today; films like Predator and Alien still work within it's boundaries. The battle scenes are terrific and the fast-paced editing is ground-breaking. If people have a problem with subtitles and long movies, then see this and your opinions will change. The sheer filmmaking of Kurosawa will not disappoint. Also see Yojimbo and High & Low."
Quinoa1984,"Dec 7, 2003",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa was and is considered the master of east-western film-making (in that he made his Japanese films accessible for fans of American westerns while still making the movies his country found popular), and out of the few Kurosawa movies I've had the pleasure of viewing (Hidden Fortress, Rashomon, and this) I'd have to say that while Rashomon is still my favorite, I nevertheless had a blast during this one. The story has become quite influential to filmmakers from the likes of John Sturges (The Magnificent Seven) to John Lasseter (A Bug's Life): a small village has been terrorized by bandits for far too long, amid times of civil war in the nation, and so on the advice of Grand-Dad, they decide to hire four - which soon becomes seven - samurai for the job. There's no money, just food and honor, even though the village isn't exactly pleased to have samurai back in their village. Each character is drawn and executed compellingly, though for my money Toshiro Mifune proves why he became one of Japan's most notorious film actors. His work as the brave, bold outcast of the seven is awe-inspiring practically all the way through, like the hero of a western that anyone can root for since he's a true rebel at heart within a group of men with a task at hand.Kurosawa directs his tale and main and supporting players like a grand composer, orchestrating a vivid story and extracting from great actors like Takashi Shimura (the old, wise Samurai), Ko Kimura (the disciple Samurai), Daisuke Kato (Schichiroji), and Mifune (Kikuchiyo, which isn't his real name) just the right touches of humanity, humor, tragedy, romance, and intensity. The overall intensity, by the way, isn't over-estimated; its long length (almost 3 1/2 hours) isn't distracting in the slightest since Kurosawa's editing and photography (the later helmed by Asakazu Nakai) are extraordinary. Not to compare the two films, but one thing I saw in common with Seven Samurai and a Lord of the Rings film is that, if anything else, it definitely isn't a boring experience. Along with a score by Fumio Hayasaka that gives the film just a bit more of a pulse, and a showdown that is relentless with excitement, this is one of the must-see action films for film buffs, or anyone with an serious interest in having fun with an epic."
Platypuschow,"Aug 17, 2018",9/10,"I've been on a Toho binge for a while now and for the most part the films have been enjoyable, especially those by Kurosawa.The earlier films were dark, bleak and unsettling viewing and therefore going into Seven Samurai I was of two minds. First I expected more of the same, in both quality and tone but then on the flipside at time of writing this is ranked as the 19th highest rated movie on IMDB which is incredible.My expectations were that it would be good, but that's about it. Seeing Takashi Shimura in the credits also confirmed my logic that this was going to at least be an entertaining three and a half hours.I was mistaken, Seven Samurai is not good............it's outstanding.Wonderfully crafted, perfectly scored, incredibly choreographed, well acted and beautifully written this is well deserving of it's high place and I would consider it nothing short of a masterpiece.If you check out my IMDB rating distribution it's very clear to see that getting anything higher than an eight is a rarity, this deserves it on so many levels.I didn't expect this level of quality further as generally I don't tend to agree with titles in the IMDB top 250, this however I do I thoroughly unconditionally agree.A masterpiece and essential viewing, I don't even need to give the premise of the movie in this review and must simply stress that this is film making mastery at its finest.The Good:Takashi ShimuraVery well shot for its timePerfectly craftedThe Bad:Nothing springs to mindThings I Learnt From This Movie:Akira Kurosawas should be a household name, not Bruckheimer or Bay!I'll put money down now that none of the remakes or movies heavily influenced by Seven Samurai comes close in quality"

groatski,"Oct 18, 2005",7/10,"Okay, call me an ignorant, uncultured, short-attention-span Yank if you wish, but I found this movie drawn-out and difficult to follow. It was indeed masterful storytelling with great character development, but the movie seemed to take quite a long time to get going, and when it did it was not the cinematic juggernaut I was expecting. Perhaps my expectations were too high? I don't think so. As of this writing Seven Samurai is at #6 in the all-time greatest movies list (and the only foreign-born film in the top 20), so I've obviously missed something big.This was by no means a bad movie; it was in fact a very good movie. However, all the really excellent movies I've seen have one thing in common - they carry you away with them. You get so involved with the story and characters that you feel like you know them personally. I did not get that here. Instead I kept trying to figure out what was going on, and why people were dramatically wailing and rolling on the ground in reaction to situations that didn't seem to warrant it. Is there perhaps a cultural difference that I'm not linking into? Am I over-analyzing it? I fully expected to walk away from this film wide-eyed and and muttering 'Wow. Just.wow' over and over (as I have with so many other films on IMDb's top 100), but instead I'm left to ponder why I seem to be the only one who's not getting it. I'd watch it again, but 3-1/2 hours is a long time."
simon_booth,"Jan 31, 2003",10/10,"Well, if you haven't seen Seven Samurai then you're not really  qualified to call yourself a film fan, basically. One of the most  influential movies of all time, that still holds up extremely well  nearly 50 years later.  Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of heroism and barbarism set the standard in  so many ways it's hard to imagine that any modern film does not show  its influence in some way or other. A great script, great characters,  mostly great acting, splendid cinematography and action sequences that  wrote the book about how these things should be filmed. Even now, after  so many have tried to imitate or beat it, Seven Samurai remains a  totally gripping 3.5 hour experience.  Akira Kurosawa is one of the gods of Cinema - men who seem to have been  born to make films, who have it in their blood. People like Alfred  Hitchcock, Stanley Kubrick, King Hu and Steven Spielberg, who make it  look easy... who so obviously ""get it"". In this pantheon, Kurosawa is  perhaps the daddy of them all, however, and Seven Samurai is one of his  finest moments.  The scale of the production is remarkable - to undertake making such an  epic in post-war Japan was a feat in itself. The cast of dozens of  inhabitants of a village specially built for the movie, the 40 bandits  and their horses, all the costumes, the armour, the weapons. Few  directors could have brought all of this together and still paid such  attention to the smallest of details in script and scene. Credit must  go to the team Kurosawa worked with too, I presume   The movie's setup became the template for many movies to follow, the  most recentl example that comes to mind being the excellent Korean  period movie MUSA (The Warrior), for example. A motley band of  characters is assembled and placed in a situation where the odds are  seemingly stacked against them, and each gets there chance to really  shine, prove themselves and become something more than a normal man.  Kurosawa's Samurai movies all share a little bit in common, which is  the depiction of the Samurai as some noble beast, different from the  common and pathetic rabble of ordinary man. In Seven Samurai the  farmers are a base lot, cowardly, selfish, vain, pathetic and  treacherous. How he found actors with such miserable looking faces is a  mystery in itself. In contrast, the Samurai embody all the qualities  that humanity would generally like to believe define it (us). Brave,  righteous, honest, strong and heroic. Toshiro Mifune's character stands  in the middle and represents this difference - perhaps meant to suggest  that mankind can strive to rise above his flaws, but mostly suggesting  to me that the common man is basically a mess and we should learn to  respect our betters. Kurosawa was definitely not a socialist, unless  I'm mis-reading him wildly.  I'm sure many out there wonder, does a 50 year old black and white  movie about Samurai really have any interest or relevance to us in the  21st century? The answer is a definite ""Yes!"". Seven Samurai shows us  what cinema can be, what cinema is *meant* to be. It is moving picture  as art in a way that the multiplex-fillers of today cannot possibly  claim to be. It's a film that satisfies on many different levels, and  still provides a bench mark which today's film makers could and should  use to evaluate their own contributions. True, few out there will ever  be able to claim they've made a film that rivals Seven Samurai in scope  or beauty, but this *is* what every director should aspire to! The sad  thing is, I just can't see a project like this ever coming out of the  Hollywood studio system, where art is just another commodity and  marketing is the new god"
LJGull,"Nov 9, 2003",6/10,"While I'd recommend this movie to anyone who hasn't seen it, I really don't think it's worthy of a top 10 ranking. The storyline was solid, but, like most movies of it's era, the over-acting bordered on being comical. Which brings up a point...I have read several user comments about how older movies don't get a fair shake in the movie rankings. I completely disagree, I think a lot of the ""timeless classics"" are rated a lot higher than deserved. Fact of the matter is, modern movies ARE better than movies of bygone eras...the acting is better, the storylines are crisper, they're better directed, there's more attention to detail, etc. This is just one guy's opinion, but after watching this movie, ask yourself a question...If this movie were to come out today (with the same acting and directing), would it receive the same high acclaim it enjoys? No way."
alhazmi90,"Oct 29, 2019",5/10,"I'm surprised that this film is rated one of the top movies of all time, it's good don't get me wrong but not that good.
if you're considering watching it, then buckle up for long boring pointless scenes!
it doesn't have artistic cinematography, it doesn't have good music, it doesn't have a villain, it doesn't have outstanding scenes
but it does have a decent story and good characters.
maybe it was something in the fifties but not these days, Kurusawa is overrated and by the way I watched thousands of movies and I don't see something outstanding in his work.
Remember the movie is 3h and 27m
It's watchable but not great."
Snow Leopard,"Nov 28, 2001",N/A,"Story-telling at its finest, ""Seven Samurai"" is a terrific film not because of a handful of memorable scenes or lines, but rather because scene-by-scene, frame-by-frame, it tells an interesting story as well as it is possible to tell it.  The story and characters are developed carefully, and everything about the movie, from the settings and props to the musical score, is done carefully and expertly.Mifune grabs the attention in most of his scenes, and Shimura's more restrained character is a nice balance.  Those two have the best parts, but all seven of the samurai are memorable characters.  The sequence of events that collects the seven together occupies the first part of the movie, and forms a perfect foundation for the rest.  A few of the villagers are also portrayed nicely, although they are naturally overshadowed when the samurai are around.The story always moves along nicely, with many ups and downs.  It has enough unpredictability to keep you interested the whole time, without ever losing its credibility.  There is plenty of action, but there is also substance behind the action to give it more significance.  The only possible drawback is the long running time (you can always split it up into two installments, but it's more satisfying if you can watch the whole story through at once), but there is little that you could cut out, even if you wanted to.  It holds your attention the entire time with a good story and great technique, not by resorting to sensational or sordid details.This movie well deserves its reputation for excellence, and is one that everyone who appreciates classic cinema will want to see and enjoy."
PragyaKirtiRao,"Apr 11, 2023",10/10,"Kurosawa's ability to show the very human emotions and willpower (in desperate times) through the chaos and unjust atrocities is unparalleled. His storytelling lies in plain sight that throws realistic details in every frame, It's so poetically heart wrenching. Every frame is illustriously beautiful, Dynamically executed and portrayed. I'm speechless, Never seen a film 3.5 hours long with this much attention and such emotions. It shows how powerful Kurosawa's direction is!It's undoubtedly one of the greatest films of last century. A poetic masterpiece that teaches you the art of war in a utter painful way."
Giuseppe_Silecchia,"Apr 16, 2024",10/10,"If there's a film that embodies the very essence of Japanese cinema and continues to influence generations of filmmakers worldwide, it's Akira Kurosawa's ""The Seven Samurai."" Set in the tumultuous 16th century during the feudal wars, the film offers a gripping look at the life of a village threatened by the continuous attacks of unscrupulous bandits. The pulsating heart of the narrative is the desperate search for defense by the villages, forced to find a solution to protect their lives and resources. The recruitment of seven masterless samurai becomes the only hope of survival for these defenseless peasants. But what emerges is not just a story of heroism and sacrifice, but a deeper reflection on human nature and society of the time. Kurosawa's direction exudes mastery in every frame, creating an intense and engaging atmosphere that captivates the viewer from the opening scenes. The famous final sequence of the battle in the rain is a tangible example of Kurosawa's visual brilliance, using tight editing and dynamic cinematography to convey the agony and glory of combat. But ""The Seven Samurai"" is not just an action film. Within it lie universal themes such as altruism, loyalty, and the struggle for survival. The characters, rich in nuance and complexity, imprint themselves in the viewer's memory, each with their own baggage of hopes, fears, and desires. One of the most fascinating elements of the film is the relationship between the samurai and the peasants they protect. While the former bring with them a sense of nobility and duty, the latter embody the resilience and determination of those fighting for a better future. It is this blend of forces and vulnerabilities that makes the story so compelling and touching. ""The Seven Samurai"" is not only top-tier cinematic entertainment but also a lesson in history and humanity. Every single scene of the film is loaded with meaning and depth, offering food for thought on themes that are still relevant in contemporary society. For anyone passionate about high-quality cinema and seeking an engaging and unforgettable experience, ""The Seven Samurai"" represents an essential journey into the feudal era of Japan. It is an epic of courage, sacrifice, and hope that continues to inspire and move audiences of all generations."
Gumbo-3,"Sep 26, 1998",10/10,"If ever there were a film that could make even the most xenophobic American film-goers begin to accept foreign films, ""The Seven Samurai"" is it. Akira Kurosawa's magnum opus (speaking of foreign) is a tour de force of cinematic style, fast-paced and exuberant action, and most importantly, magnificent characters.  This film is not a sanctimonious, solemn foreign picture.  On the contrary, 3-1/2 hours won't feel like enough as you see the seven brave swordsman use cunning, skill, bravery and humor to transform a village of cowardly farmers into a team of spear-wielding warriors. It is a shame that so many American moviegoers fear subtitles and exotic tales of centuries ago, because many of them won't give ""The Seven Samurai"" a chance.  But this film is a must-see not only for film buffs who want to see great writing, acting, cinematography and directing, as well as the archetype for the American western, but also for anyone who loves tales of heroism, love, war, revenge, or just a grand old time at the movies.  This is one of the finest films in history, and it should be required viewing for everyone with a VCR."

As Kambei walks towards town a young samurai, Katsushiro : Kimura , asks to become his acolyte. Then the farmers ask Kambei to help defend their village; to their great joy, he accepts. Kambei, with Katsushiro's assistance, then enlists four samurai more from the city, . Kambei initially decides that seven masterless samurai , Ronin , would be necessary to recruit , and time is running short . The villagers beg him to take Katsushiro also and, with some prodding by the others, he agrees . A clownish samurai named Kikuchiyo : Toshirô Mifune , whom Kambei had rejected for the mission, follows them to the village at a distance , ignoring their protestations and attempts to drive him away. The team gradually come together and 7 Samurai , at last , one by one, each with distinctive skills and personality traits ; all of them to help a poor village against savage thieves .As Kambei and his buddies , each of whom comes for a different reason , must free a village attacked by heinous outlaws who are devastating the small location . All of them get a chance to redeem themselves . Later on , the bunch develops a plan to secure the villagers defend it against enemy attack .This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actors Toshiro Mifune , and Takashi Shimura , being his international breakthrough one . Sweeping , dramatic , complex human drama with all the ingredients : suspense , action , comedy , character studio and many other things . Seven Samurai , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought-provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The story is classic and traditional , following its interesting premise in subsequent remakes , rif-offs and sequels , including customary misfit band formed by an eclectic gang with diverse characters as well as speciality . Kurosawa took an elemental Western issue ¨good guys against bad guys¨ plot and turned it into a breathtaking classy which is still probably the best-know and one best Samurai film to come from Japan . At the time of its making it got a big success at the boxoffice around the world . Kurosawa's pacing is immaculate and allows for periods of calm in which to establish roles punctuated by viscerally thrilling burst of action . These culminate in the overwhelming climatic battle between the bandits and the samurai which ranks among the very nicest combat scenes ever put on movie . It is followed by several reboots and imitations . Standing out ¨The magnificent seven¨ by John Sturges . Unlike Sturges' remake in 7 Samurai the roles grow originally from the action and they are not conveniently established by star-casting , like in the American film formed by big actors as Yul Brynner , Charles Bronson , James Coburn , Robert Vaughn , Brad Dexter , Elli Wallach . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a valiant Samurai , as he is a harebrained but courageous young dominating warrior , as well as Takashi Shimura as the intelligent and brave leader of the fabulous Samurai . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune .This fiercely-charging , uncompromising picture was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . And available in a big number of versions of varying length , all too long . Kurosawa's previous and subsequent years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , this great epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy . Rating : 7.7/10 . Better than average . Well worth watching ."
Shilo_R_A,"Dec 3, 2023",5/10,"You know, even though I consider myself a rather big film nerd, I can't say that I've seen much when it comes to Japanese cinema. I mean, I've seen my fair share of anime, sure, but when it comes to non-animated stuff I could count the number of Japanese movies I've seen on one hand. Even so, I know who Akira Kurosowa is. If Hayao Miyazaki is the best known Japanese animation director, then Kurosowa is the best known director of Japanese live-action films. I've only watched one other film from him so far, High and Low, and it was pretty good, but, in my opinion, RIDICOULOUSLY overrated among film nerds. Considering the fact that Seven Samurai is even more highly regarded, and my previous experience with Kurosowa, I didn't really know what to feel or what to expect. Before watching this movie, though, a fellow film-nerd told me that Kurosowa is like a Japanese Spielberg. After watching this movie, I can say that this is pretty accurate, in the context of this film, but I'm getting ahead of myself. Let's dive into it.Seven Samurai is a 1954 Japanese film, and it follows a little village of farmers in 16th century Japan. Each year, after harvest, bandits come to the village and forcefully take most of the crop. The farmers, in a desperate measure, decide to send a few people to look for Samurai that could protect the village. The problem is that Samurai are from the highest levels of society, while the farmers are poor and can only pay with food. As the film progresses and the mission to prepare the village to defeat the bandits once and for all proceeds, we see the internal conflicts, the seemingly impossible fight that's in front of the farmers and the bloody chaos that rules in 16th century, war-infested Japan.The Spielberg comparison actually makes so much sense to me after watching this movie. Critics and film nerds alike tend to worship Spielberg, but at the end of the day he is, generally, a blockbuster director. Very accessible, very mainstream, able to dabble in different genres each time but still be adored by almost everyone with each film he releases. From my experience with Spielberg so far he tends to capture ideas that weren't really brought to the mainstream before and execute them in ways that are maybe not mind-blowing, but are definitely enough to make an impact on the mainstream - sometimes the result is pretty good, sometimes it's just okay. This is, more or less, how I feel about Seven Samurai. This movie is like the prototype, or the gen-1, or even the original, if you will, blockbuster.We'll come back to that later, but I want to touch on some other aspects of the film. First of all, it's truly well-made visually. Kurosowa is known for his masterful blocking, and though I can't say that there are many shots that made me feel something, many of them are really pleasant and well-composed. Gotta give credit when it's due. This just goes to show you that whether a film looks good is not a question of technology first, but more a question of how good is the directing, the cinematography, the composition of each scene.I really like the score, too. From the brooding, dark theme song, through the colorful music of the big city and to the careful, almost childish music in the background of the romance-related scenes. It's not crazy, but again, well-made. An aspect of this film I definitely enjoyed.I think that when talking about this film as a blockbuster, one can really appreciate the scope of this movie, considering the time in which it came out. At almost 3.5 hours, and with a really big cast of characters and grand battle scenes, this film was really ambitious. It almost made the studio go broke with how much money the production needed. Nothing can take that away from this movie, but even though it's very impressive to pull this sort of plot off in the 1950's, it doesn't make this film good. You see, there are some parts of the story that I like - cool use of tropes that later became classic, some aspects of the romance subplot, the BURNING HOUSE SCENE WITH THE GIRL WAKING UP (which is WAY too good for this movie, honestly), the way that this movie manages to make us feel the setting, the location, how it teaches us about the village's structure to make one of the more realistic battle scenes I've seen, strategically speaking. But these parts are not the main thing here, and are scattered throughout the movie. Most of it I honestly find nothing more than okay, and sometimes (like almost every scene with Kikuchiyo) it's just too stiff, too forced, too shallow. A film that establishes so many characters (that are simple but still all different) might really need this runtime, sure, it's not unheard of, but the story itself is just not that interesting. I like some parts of it, but 3.5 hours that are mostly just pretty decent to mediocre blockbuster material are just not worth it. Sorry for anyone who loves this film, but this is how I feel.Seven Samurai's scope is definitely impressive, and it has some cool, fun moments, well-composed shots and a good soundtrack. The biggest chunk of this 3.5-hour long movie, though, is somewhere between mediocre and not bad, and this just won't do in such a long film. It becomes tiresome, and along with the parts of this film that feel too over-the-top to really work, I feel like this movie is not much more than a mediocre experience. Again - it has some good, and not a lot of bad, but with such a length and not enough substance it just doesn't succeed at getting me immersed. Feeling a 5.8/10 on this one."
Kool_Joker,"Sep 30, 2002",N/A,"This is my favorite Kurosawa film, the man was a true master of the cinematic arts.  If you have never seen a Kurosawa film definetly make this your first.  Though extremely long at about 3 1/2 hours it is well worth the time spent.To quickly summarize, a poor Japanese village hires 7 Samurai to protect it from being raided by bandits.  Don't get me wrong there is way more to it than that, I just dont want to give anything away.  This is an intense and emotional movie that hooks you from the first scene and keeps you on the line till it is all over.  The battle scene at the end is in true Kurosawa form.  The acting is outstanding by everyone involved from the main characters all the way down to the very last extra.  Of course the best way to see any film, especially a Kurosawa film is on the big screen if you are able to.  Beautifully filmed, in black and white, anyone familiar with Kurosawa's work has to wonder visually how much more gorgeous it could have been had Kurosawa had the option of color in 1954.The camera use is brilliant and every scene is balanced visually.  This film is also the first one to use ""the wipe"" as a way of changing from one scene to another.  This technique was later used by George Lucas in his Star Wars movies.  I would also recommend the DVD version that has the commentary option by the Japanese cinema expert if anyone is interested in a deeper understanding of the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of Kurosawa's film making.  Any man, woman, boy or girl who just wants to see a really, really great movie, THIS IS THE ONE!  An A+++ in my book."
claudio_carvalho,"Aug 2, 2009",10/10,"In the Sixteenth Century, in Japan, a poor village is frequently looted by armed bandits losing their crop of rice. Their patriarch Grandpa advises the villagers to hire a Ronin to defend their village. Four farmers head to town to seek out their possible protectors, but they just can offer three meals of rice per day and lodging for the samurai. They succeed in hiring the warming-hearted veteran Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) that advises that they need six other samurai to protect their lands. Kambei recruits the necessary five samurai and the brave jester Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) and move to the village. After a feared reception, Kambei plots a defense strategy and the samurai start training the farmers how to defend their lands and families for the battle that approaches.In order to celebrate the milestone of 4,000 reviews in IMDb, I decided to watch again ""The Seven Samurai"", the most known masterpiece of Akira Kurosawa and among my Top-10 movies ever. As far as I recall, this was the first samurai movie that I have watched and it is still my favorite despite many other excellent movies. ""The Seven Samurai"" is a perfect movie: the story and screenplay are amazing, dividing the dramatic story in the recruitment, reception, strategy, training, harvest, romance and the final battle of the samurai in such a way that the viewer does not feel the 207 minutes running time. The direction of Akira Kurosawa is perfectionist as usual, and the choreography of the battle in the rain is extremely realistic. The acting is top-notch, highlighting Toshirô Mifune in a great shape, climbing trees, jumping and fighting in the role of a funny character. The cinematography, set decoration, costumes, lighting, everything is fantastic. In 1960, John Sturges remade this masterpiece with the western ""The Magnificent Seven"". My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Os 7 Samurais"" (""The 7 Samurai"")"
markbray4,"Sep 8, 2003",10/10,"This flick has everything.  Drama.  Comedy.  Action.  It's just a really fun ride, with some depth to it.What really amazes me is that it's 3.5 hours long, and there isn't a single scene where I feel it drags.  In fact, I like ""Seven Samurai"" more every time I watch it.Everything about this film (the script, score, acting, directing) is perfect.I'd give it an 11 if I could, but I guess I have to give it a 10."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 22, 2022",10/10,"Fearing for their lives and livelihood, a group of villagers hire seven samurai to protect them from a group of marauding bandits.For my shame, this is the first Samurai movie I've ever seen, and if this is anything to go by, I've seriously been missing out.A bold statement, but I would call this film a masterpiece, it's actually pretty long, but where some modern two or three hour modern films bore me a little, I hadn't noticed that an afternoon had passed me by, it had actually gone dark when the credits rolled.Quite a lot of violence for a film of this time, the main showdown is a fantastic, quite brutal scene, it's the moment you wait for, although the initial character play is very interesting, the acting is too notch.I've read a few comments where people have said they found it hard to follow, personally I didn't, I engaged the whole way through.Visually very striking, the sets and production values hold up remarkably well.It's brilliant, 10/10."
haildevilman,"Jan 6, 2006",10/10,"I had the pleasure to see this film in America sub-titled and in a Japanese theater in it's original uncut version. This movie gets better every time.The action scenes are better than anything out there today and Kurosawa-san didn't have CGI to abuse.It was incredible seeing this mismatched group of men band together to risk their lives for people they didn't really respect. Great character build-up, brilliant action, superb tension, and even some flashes of comedy. And it's one of the DEEPEST action films that ever existed.It shows the duty the samurai dedicates himself to. That whether he likes it or not, there are some things he just MUST do.3&1/2 hours long but it seemed like 1&1/2. How many films can honestly say that today? Never looked at my watch once."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 9, 2012",10/10,"As much as I do love Ran, The Hidden Fortress and Throne of Blood, it was Seven Samurai that I love most of Akira Kurasawa's films. As with all Kurasawa's films, it is incredibly well made with authentic scenery that would give meaning to the term epic and the camera work is truly spectacular. This is especially true in the final battle, with inspired use of moving and multiple camera, precise editing, telephoto lenses and variegated film speeds. As always with Kurasawa, the direction is consistently brilliant. Add to that a stirring score from Fumio Hayasaka and a thoughtful script and you have more reasons why Seven Samurai is so good. The story unfolds slowly, but never felt dull to me and is never hampered by the three-and-a-half-hour running time. Plus Seven Samurai is interesting for being one of the first few to utilise the plot element of recruiting/gathering of heroes into a team to achieve a goal, seen especially with when the audience is first introduced Kambei. The action is spectacular and looks even better with the use of multiple cameras from various angles, and any humanity Seven Samurai has, and it does have a lot, is shown in a poignant way. The cast are excellent, with Takashi Shimura and especially Toshiro Mifune the standouts. Overall, of a resume of one of the greatest directors who ever lived, responsible for many wonderful movies(and I'd say that Seven Samurai and Ran are among the best movies ever made) Seven Samurai stands tall. One of the easiest 10/10s I've ever given. Bethany Cox"
murtaza_mma,"Apr 19, 2009",10/10,"Shichinin no samurai is a quintessential Kurosawa movie, and probably his greatest lagniappe to the world of cinema. Shichinin no samurai is a classic example of a profound character study well complemented by some ingenious direction and breathtaking cinematography. The world of cinema owes a colossal debt to the master movie-maker and plethora of his sui generis works such as this one. The movie depicts penury with sheer brilliance and uncanny resplendence.The inexorable resolve exhibited by the destitute villagers to fight the rapacious bandits can be inspiring even to the most pessimistic. The fidelity shown by the samurai to the villagers, each hired for a bowl of rice, accentuates the very essence of humanity. The movie's slow pace and its poignant background score enriches it with a sense of melancholy, thereby making it truly mesmerizing to watch. The entire cast has performed really well, taking care of the nuances with utmost precision and incredible conviction. Kurosawa's plaintive storytelling, coupled with his subtle brilliance, makes the movie a truly ineffable experience for the viewer.PS. Though not meant for everyone, the movie is sine qua non for cineastes and avid lovers of pristine cinema. It's also a great means to get acquainted with Kurosawa's oeuvre before exploring his more personal works like Rashomon, Ikiru, Ran, etc.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
belikemichaeldotcom,"Jan 31, 2004",6/10,"When I saw that this film was one of the top rated IMDB films, I had to see it.   Overall, it was a decent movie, but I failed to recognize its greatness.  It was way too long (3+ hours) and it was just a simple story, decently acted and, well, kinda blah.  Maybe my hopes were set too high, but when I finally saw ""Bicycle Thief"", that film completely lived up to its praise, as do most of the other top rated films I've seen (although ""Casablanca"" is another extremely overrated flick).I don't know, maybe it's a Kurosawa thing or maybe it's us westerners simply amazed at the mystique of the Samurai.  Who knows?  It's not a bad film -- in fact it was somewhat enjoyable.  If you have a few extra hours to spare, pick it up on video, but as for me, I'd rather catch some of the more deserving top films.Rating: 6/10"
fearsomez,"Jul 13, 2009",6/10,"""Shichinin no samurai"", also known as ""Seven Samurai"", is a film by Akira Kurosawa released on 19 November 1956. It was a Japanese film about a small village that was having trouble with a group of forty armed bandits. The village hires a samurai to help defend the village. The samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) determines that he will need six other samurai to defend the village. The total of seven samurai trains the village how to defend themselves. They end up using a cunning strategy to cut some of the bandits off from the others to take out several at a time. At the same time there is an underling story of romance. This film is a very interesting film that uses filming techniques and quality far beyond its time. Akira Kurosawa was one of the first to use multiple cameras to get different angles. It has the action needed to catch the viewer with an underling story of love. It shows seven people who got together to help a village in need, which created a bond together that will last a lifetime. The village had a great victory defeating the bandits, but the samurai lost, in that they lose several of their new found friends. For me, this movie is a very inspirational film, which shows how friendship can be formed in even extreme times. It has the quality needed and the length to have a well formed plot that is difficult to see with many of the shorter films that they have now. Many films try to catch the viewer with special effects and attractive people, but this film did not have that option and had to use the plot and amazing filming techniques to attract the viewer."
MatrixFn,"May 21, 2000",2/10,"They should change the title of this to ""long, pointless, and boring."" Seven Samurai has no redeeming value whatsoever.Even the subtitles sucked.  In fact, they were the absolute worse I've ever seen.  Half the dialogue either wasn't translated or was white or white and therefore unreadable!  This made the plot hard to follow; fortunately, there wasn't much to follow.  A five year old could guess the conclusion after the first 10 minutes!A lot of people say there is incredible depth in 7 samurai.  They must be on crack.  The characters on incredibly shallow.  We learn nothing about anyone in the movie.  You'd think in three hours one could probe the characters minds - find out why they act as they do, but nope, once a character is introduced their developement stops.Then their are the inane sub-plots that go nowhere.  Please!  If you are going to introduce a plot device, have it go somewhere.  In real life, everything isn't meaningful, but this isn't real life - it is a movie.  If I wanted to see pointless stuff happening, I could look out my window!It is said that the Brigand's helmet inspired Darth Vader's.  If that's true, then the dumb ""comic"" guy must have inspired Jar-Jar (that is not a good thing).  At least Lucas had an excuse for including a dumb character - Phantom Menace was a kids movie.  Akira had no business doing so in Seven Samurai.So why does this movie have such a high rating?  I attribute it primarily to the fact that everyone is afraid to you they didn't like a ""classic.""  If people stopped thinking like drones, maybe we could come to realize that some ""classics"" really aren't very good.  Just because a film is old & very known, doesn't mean it is great.In conclusion, Seven Samurai is terrible.  It is juvenille, lacks depth or character developement, and, in general, is highly overrated."
yippeiokiyay,"Jan 17, 2006",N/A,"Donald Richie thought it was Kurosawa's finest, and suggested that it might the best Japanese film ever made.It is a film that rewards casual viewing and careful viewing and repeated viewing and viewing over time. Isn't that rather like a wonderful book, that rewards you every time you pick it up? I suppose that is the definition of greatness.How was this greatness achieved? (This is not a rhetorical question. It truly astonishes me how this film creates meaning...cutting across all boundaries of nationality, language, and culture to become a meaningful personal experience for those who view it). This creation of greatness may be a mystery, but we can point to the some features of the film's excellence:The artistic achievement: The music, the cinematography, the extensive set design, the editing and the acting in the service of a moving story all conspire to create a world that becomes ours on a deeply personal level. It is a film which influences later films and filmmakers.The narrative achievement: Based on an original concept of Kurosawa's which began as a ""day in the life"" documentary of a samurai's existence, Kurosawa developed the idea into this breathtaking film of samurai who save a village. This simple but complexly nuanced human story involves us in different social classes in an historical framework. We come to know individual peasants and samurai, and feel that we know significant things about them, their motivations, hopes and fears.The achievements of the actors: These are characters you will love, people you need to have in your life: the characters of Kyuzo, Heihachi and the unforgettable Bokuzen Hidari as a bewildered peasant..! Takeshi Shimura, as the leader of the samurai, Gambei, is the embodiment of wisdom, and calm in the storm. And, saying that Toshiro Mifune has star power is like saying the noonday sun sheds a little warmth.Toshiro: It's the cut of his jawline when he asks the village patriarch, ""Got a problem, grandad?"", and the most charming look of confusion and embarrassment playing over his face when he is told by Heihachi that he is the triangle on the samurai flag. It's his energy, speed and agility and power and intelligence. Mifune sniffing out the fuse of a gun in the woods, bouncing through the brush half-naked in an abbreviated set of armor, or carrying his ridiculously oversize sword on one shoulder, Mifune crying over a baby, and the incomparable scene of his embarrassment that turns to rage when Mifune accuses the samurai of creating the farmer's condition.Toshiro Mifune represents with extraordinary physicality the spirit of a man desperate to prove his worth: Mifune's got the animal sexuality, the physical response to emotional situations, the expressive face, the humorous and varied vocalisms to make us feel deeply what his character experiences: his struggles, his growth.(His drunken burblings as the last ""samurai"" to audition are nothing short of hilarious, and his ""fish singing"" is eerie and funny, too...also the grunted ""eh?"" that he often uses to show confusion, and the ""heh"" of disgust..such wonderful sounds, and so expressive!) Mifune's acting is wild and alive, even more than 50 years after the film's original release.Takashi Shimura: You will trust him with your life. His great, open heart, his mature calm, his honesty and compassion make him one of the greatest of all samurai on film.Fumio Hayasaka's music: Kuroasawa was lucky to have such a brilliant composer as collaborator. Themes introduce characters, and the samurai theme is surprising and memorable. If you have viewed the film, chances are, the samurai theme is playing in your mind with just a mention of the music. Hayasaka's music is muscular and nuanced: creating humor, or a counterpoint to the action, or deepening our sympathy for and understanding of the characters.Muraki's scenography: There is no doubt that the places shown in the film are real. The achievement of Kurosawa's longtime collaborator provide a real world for the action.The filmography is ground-breaking: the multiple cameras, slow-motion and attention to light and composition make each frame worthy of an 8X10 glossy. How can individual moments of such beauty be sustained throughout the movement of the film? It is an astonishing feat. And, best of all, no image degenerates into interior design or vacuous prettiness...everything forwards the movement of the cinematic experience. When the film ends, we feel as if we have lived it!It is with great respect and humility that I offer my thanks to the memory of Mr. Kurosawa. His great work leads us to treasure humanity and its struggles, to develop our own abilities to feel compassion, encourages us to try to make good choices, to be socially and morally responsible, to embrace life."
kevin_robbins,"Jul 3, 2023",10/10,"Seven Samurai (1954) is an Akira Kurosawa classic that is in my DVD collection that I recently rewatched on MAX. The storyline follows a town desperate for help that is broke due to regular attacks by local bandits. They decide to pool their funds together and put out a false claim that they will pay 💰 a significant sum of money for help fighting the bandits. A team of samurai form in hopes of saving the city and getting the money for a new start in life.As previously referenced, this movie is directed by Akira Kurosawa (The Hidden Fortress) and stars Toshiro Mifune (Yojimbo), Takashi Shimura (Ikiru), Keiko Tsushima (Sincere Heart), Seiji Miyaguchi (Throne of Blood) and Kamatari Fujiwara (Ikiru).This is an inspiring tale with fun characters that are easy to root for and have a worthwhile cause. There's a nice blend of hope, comedy, tragedy and triumph as the film unfolds. The script is brilliant as chemistry is built between the characters and the daunting circumstances unfold. The recruiting and training scenes are legendary and the sword fights at the end are tremendous. The storyline is intricate but perfectly paced despite the long run time. The conclusion is both sad and rewarding.Overall, this is a cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see. I would score this a 10/10 and strongly recommend it."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Mar 30, 2022",10/10,"Just a perfect movie from beginning to end, really. It was the first Akira Kurosawa movie and the first real samurai movie I ever watched, way back in 2011 now. I really loved it then, but 10 years and dozens of samurai movies later, I only now appreciate how truly great it is.Flaws? I guess a couple of the samurai aren't as well developed as the five most significant ones... but that's it. It's barely a flaw. It's a 207-minute long movie and that's its worst offence.Everything else is great. Excellent characters, good pacing, a fantastically simple yet satisfying story perfectly told, great sets and costumes, an engaging ""assembling the team"" sequence in the first hour, engaging buildup/preparation for the ending in the second hour, and some satisfying and tense action in the final hour.Great editing, good music, every shot is almost perfectly composed, a good balance of humour with the drama that never undermines the seriousness of the story, a willingness to show almost all the characters as various shades of grey rather than black and white... I mean, I could go on and on, but it's all just excellent. And this is all without mentioning it arguably the established the modern action movie as we now know it, because there's surprisingly few movies made before this one that feel like action movies by today's standards.Should also mention that it was a lot of fun rewatching this the night after rewatching A Bug's Life, and trying to find similarities between the two.Kurosawa made many great movies but this is the greatest of them. Seven Samurai is an almost untouchable classic, and deservedly so."
snypr-55002,"Jun 25, 2023",10/10,"This... This is THE film that gave birth to modern cinema. The peak of entertainment. Any movie released should be compared to this masterpiece as a textbook reference. The writing is perfect, how the backstory and contribution of each individual character compliments to the story and each other. The direction on logical flow is magnificent. The ideas revolutionary. While modern writing is mostly about dialogues, this film also makes use of silences to actually contribute to the storyline. No doubt the best of Toshiro Mifune and legendary director Akira Kurosawa. Star wars fans, this was the true birthplace of George Lucas, the apprentice of the legend himself."
axtiik,"Nov 3, 2024",10/10,"The 1954 film Seven Samurai is an incredible movie that leaves an unforgettable impression on anyone who watches it. From the very beginning, it's clear that this film is not just for entertainment but is deep, philosophical, and highly emotional at the same time. It's a story that immerses you in the era of samurai and shows a battle not only against external enemies but also internal fears and doubts.The first thing that struck me was the story itself. It seems simple: a group of samurai protects a village from bandits, but director Akira Kurosawa skillfully reveals the character of each individual, making you care about them as if they were close friends. This film isn't just about fights; it's about humanity, bravery, sacrifice, and, of course, honor. The main character, Kambei, becomes a symbol not only of courage but of wisdom. His decisions are not always obvious, but they are always justified, adding depth to the story.The production is another aspect that stands out. Kurosawa put an incredible amount of energy and attention to detail into every frame. From large-scale battles to the small details of daily life, everything looks believable and realistic. The camera work makes you feel the tension on the battlefield, as if you're standing right there with the samurai. What impressed me the most were the battle scenes-they look natural, without excessive special effects, yet incredibly captivating. Every movement, every strike is carefully choreographed and precise.Another major highlight of the film is its music. Composer Fumio Hayasaka created such atmospheric and, at the same time, epic melodies that they become an integral part of the story. The music doesn't just accompany the events; it enhances them, creating a unique atmosphere of tension and heroism. Every time the heroes appear, you feel the grandeur and drama of the moment, and much of this effect is thanks to the soundtrack. The music sets the emotional context for each scene, guiding you through the narrative and deepening your connection to the characters.The atmosphere of the film deserves its own discussion. Kurosawa masterfully combines realistic and symbolic elements, creating a world where every detail has meaning. You can feel the windy, ominous tension before the battles and the calm and peace during quieter moments. The film strikes a unique balance between dark, heavy scenes and light, even humorous ones. This makes the viewing experience rich and dynamic, allowing you to feel a wide range of emotions-from laughter to tears.The story unfolds slowly, but no scene feels unnecessary. On the contrary, each moment builds toward the final confrontation and develops the characters. You get the chance to fully immerse yourself in their world, understand their fears, desires, and internal conflicts. This creates a strong emotional attachment to the characters, so their victories feel like your own, and their losses like a personal defeat.Seven Samurai is not just an action film or historical drama; it's a movie about choices and sacrifice. Each of the heroes has their own reasons for joining the fight, and these reasons make their stories even more touching. The film shows that being a hero is not only about defeating enemies but also about becoming a better version of yourself, giving up something important for the sake of others.In my opinion, this film is a classic that everyone should watch. Seven Samurai leaves you with much to think about, encouraging you to reconsider the importance of compassion, humanity, and mutual support."
quinnsanitygotgame,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"I stayed up til midnight watching this film. Wow. I really don't think there's anything to say that hasn't already been seen. This movie is perfect in every aspect. The constant rain brings coziness and dread. The black-and-white colouring makes it all the more immersive. Even the way it takes so long to get to the final battle (something many people would consider to be bad) adds dread and build-up. It's also realistic in the way it depicts battles and wars. Instead of people just running at each other and beating each other up, there are strategies and the entire battle takes almost a week (in the film, that is). A true masterpiece. I don't think dubbed versions exist, but if they do, just watch it with subtitles you moron."
reniruma,"Dec 21, 2025",10/10,What the title said. I watched this bc my crush mentioned liking it. He's got amazing taste.this film is allergic to empty spectacle16th century japan seems awful but also no homework so who's to sayi did not blink during the final battleevery frame feels intentional and heavy. It's brutal without being dumb and emotional without being cornyi get why people won't shut up about this movie now. Five stars and a mild existential crisis.
Nearstars,"Feb 16, 2004",6/10,"In the top 10 IMDB movies - I thought - hmm, a must see! And having enjoyed Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"" my expectations were high.But when I came to watching it, I was just desperate for the damn thing to end. Very disappointing. Sure, I spotted a lot of technically good camera work and direction (for it's time), but the story and particularly the script was distinctly lack-lustre. There were some interesting characters in it, but some of it was over-played, and not too realistic.I think this movie has to be seen on it's own merits today, and not upon how ""amazingly groundbreaking it was in its day"". Everybody talks about how amazing Citizen Kane was, and yet I had the same feeling when I saw that - one of disappointment, and ""what's all the fuss?""""Lawrence Of Arabia"" was contemporary(ish) to Seven Samurai, and people exclaimed about how amazing that film was for it's day. The difference between Lawrence and 7S is that Lawrence still looks (and is), a superb and enjoyable epic today.Let's all take a reality check, hmm?"
mstomaso,"Jul 29, 2008",9/10,"The great Akira Kurosawa's epic action masterpiece ""Seven Samurai"" is an entertaining and thoughtful war epic set in 19th century Japan. Replete with colorful well-realized characters, and sensitively portrayed social and class analysis, Kurosawa's film entertains on all levels. Although not as visually engaging as many of Kurosawa's later efforts, Seven Samurai's cinematography is still masterful, and well above most contemporary films.A farmer overhears some bandits talking about raiding his village as soon as the next harvest is ready and approaches an older Samurai master who is on the verge of retirement for help. The elder Samurai, recognizing the humility of the request and the dignity of the proposed work, takes up the cause and begins recruiting others for the defense of the village. He recruits five Samurai and takes on a young apprentice and a drunken, angry would-be Samurai avenger (Toshirô Mifune ... Kikuchiyo) as the sixth and seventh members of his newly established militia. The Samurai live among the villagers for most of a growing season, teaching them defense and discipline. In turn, the villagers - as fearful of the Samurai as they are in awe of them, hide away their daughters and some of their stores. As the inevitable crisis ensues, these two widely disparate classes of people learn to live and fight together to defend their homes and their crops.Kurosawa's film is as much social realism as it is martial historic fantasy. Their is also a steady supply of humor and an entertaining romance - both of which are relatively rare in this genre. In summary, Seven Samurai is one of those rare works of art which takes on a vast scope and sustains it with apparent facility.Highly recommended."
radioanagrama,"Jun 8, 2004",6/10,"I cannot really understand this film ranking as the 6th best ever made (according to the Top 250, not that we should treat that as the god of public opinion).Beyond the character depth, cinematography and supposed classic action pioneering. I found it to be a very minimally entertaining film, I understood the characters and their motives but the pace is excruciating and the character just grow weary. It's not that its incredibly dated, its just that when watching something like The Last Samurai, the connection and the influence to Seven Samurai is easy to notice. But regardless of the technological advances in the 50 years between the two films, Last Samurai was just as engaging as this. I can't see some ocean of brilliance in the Seven Samurai, its kitsch is its appeal, the heroes grow tiresome. I know I can't accuse it of being cliché because it created its own spawn of wannabe samurai flicks...but its not a masterpiece of epic proportions. And its certainly not the sixth best film in history."
glammy,"Mar 25, 1999",N/A,"After getting used to shoot-em-up action flicks that rely more on computers than characters to sell tickets, watching a masterpiece such as this is very refreshing.  Most people just won't bother sitting down for over 3 hours to watch a foreign-language black and white film, and it's their loss.The story is relatively simple: a village of farmers is threatened by a gang of 40 bandits who will return to destroy their village when their crops are harvested.  The elder statesman of the village suggests hiring samurai to help defend the village.  The farmers then proceed to find seven samurai who return to the village and prepare for the final battle with the bandits.What is so great about this film is the character development.  It is intriguing to watch how the farmers and samurai relate to one another, and how the farmers learn to defend themselves instead of running and hiding as they do in the beginning of the movie.  The acting is excellent and every minute of the 3.5 hour film is used to develop each character, both the samurai and individual farmers.In a time where acting, plot, and character development and interaction take a back seat to special effects and cheesy, overused subplots, watching a film like this really makes you appreciate what a great action film is all about."
SLK6087,"Oct 23, 2002",10/10,"All I have to say is that I first saw this movie in an auditorium with about 150+ other first-year film students. It was required viewing for a class. I, as well as many other students I talked to then, were none too anxious to watch a 3 1/2 hour, foreign, nearly 50-year-old movie. I had only vaguely heard of Akira Kurosawa before.After the showing, I walked outside and it was like I was stuck in a daze. I didn't know what to do, I couldn't believe what I had just seen. This movie would eventually lead me to change the way I saw movies, and what constituted a great one. Now, about two years later I have seen nearly every single Kurosawa film (everyone I talked to that first saw this with me, have ALL done so, it will happen to you if you watch and enjoy this film). I have also seen this movie about ten more times, each time introducing it to someone who has never seen a Kurosawa film before. Everyone I showed it to, regardless of their movie taste, has at the least been entertained by it.What amazes me though is how the 10th viewing of this film was just as powerful and exciting as my very first. I know no other movie I can say that of."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 10, 2014",9/10,"It's early 16th century and Japan is in the midst of civil wars. A poor village faces constant harassment from bandits. A villager overhears that bandits are planning to come back after the harvest. After a debate, the village elder proposes to hire samurai. The villagers have little to offer. They witness heroic ronin Kambei rescue a boy. Young Katsushirō is desperate to be his disciple. Kambei reluctantly agrees to help the villagers but he determines that the defense needs at least seven samurai.This is simply one of the best movies ever. It is influential in so many other movies. The characters are funny and compelling. They are iconic in their simple characteristics. Modern audiences may find the over 3 hour running time a bit too long."
travised87,"Feb 10, 2007",10/10,"When you have undergone a journey, you feel, that a change has occurred, that there is some growth, some learning and development within you that was absent at the start. Many films you watch, start at point A, and after the end, bring you back to point A. This film however, carries you along with it, so you feel part of the events that have unfolded before your eyes. At the beginning, you are thrust into the suffering of the village folk, their pain and desperation. As the film progresses, you get to know them, that they are more multi-faceted than first perceived. At the end, however, it is the samurai than you connect with, and like them, the euphoric singing of the farmers seems alien and distant to you. So you start the journey with the farmers, and finish it off with the samurai. Yes there is a melancholic feel that is not freed from the film; what's more is that it is what we can connect to better than any joy displayed in bouts. Such is the mood of the film that the ambivalence of life is inextricably linked to it.There is little else anyone can say about this film, beyond what has been said already. The pace of the film, which I was slightly wary of before watching it, was perfect I thought. The depth and detail of the plot required a painstaking build-up, if only for verisimilitude's sake. The interactions between the farmers and the samurai, two different strata of society, reveal the blatant similarities they share, concealed beneath the veil of social standing. Toshiro Mifune's character is the bridge between the two, and tellingly sacrifices his life, for the love of his ancestry, and to prove himself a true samurai. His acting is wonderful, along with Takashi Shimura's and the rest of the principal cast. Shimura who looked pathetic, decrepit in Ikiru, is a strong, canny leader here, particularly to Katsushiro. The film itself of course, can also be seen as the coming-of-age story of Kutsushiro, from a novice samurai 'child' to a war hero and lover. There is little the samurai could take away from the battle, but his growth could be one.For us though, there is a milestone in film-making to take away, something that will remain with us for a very long time. We experience an EPIC, in every sense of the word, and watch every other film, in comparison to this masterpiece!"
evanston_dad,"Aug 14, 2006",10/10,"If you think a three-hour Japanese movie from the mid-50s about an ancient time in history sounds like one big snoozer, you'd be right. It SOUNDS like a snoozer. But just sit down to watch this film, and you'll realize how wrong you are. ""Seven Samurai"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful films I've ever seen, and the running time passed so quickly that I wasn't even ready for the film to be over. I've watched T.V. sitcoms that felt longer.Akira Kurosawa displays utter mastery of every aspect of cinema. There's not a flaw in this film: it's flawlessly acted, paced, edited, composed, scored. It's an action film for thinking people, one that more than holds its own against any movie released today.Astoundingly good.Grade: A+"
ThatAnimeSnob,"Mar 19, 2013",7/10,"Akira Kurosawa's epic tale of the Seven Samurai is great on many aspects. At first it appears to be only about a bunch of unemployed mercenaries doing their job by defending a village from bandits. It quickly turns to a rather complicating interaction of ideals, social norms, and internal conflicts. Although the bad guys (the bandits) remain generic enemies all the way, the samurais and the villagers are shown to be a lot more than the simple stereotype they begin as. There are lots of minor side stories that flesh them out and enrich the setting with a lot of gray overtones.The movie is not afraid to kill its characters, despite presenting them in a most heroic way. The death toll is high and it is interesting to see how almost all of them are killed by a rifle and not by a petty bandit's spear, which is a double way to show how great they are with the sword, as well as how all your talent means nothing before modern warfare. At the same time it does not leave the villagers to be nothing but passive spectators throughout the battle, as they are given the task to participate. Along the way they are shown to be far more than stunts, as even they have secret agendas and minor problems of their own.Even as far as action goes, the movie is still great, with the swordsmanship and the invasion of the riders, or the ambush in the forest being very well orchestrated, with believable fighting moves that never feel shallow poser nonsense. Even during the non-action parts, the characters are acting very dynamically and expressively, instead of just standing still and talking.Even the ending is basically bittersweet, as despite the losses and victories life goes on but the sadness of the realization of a never- ending struggle is just overbearing.p.s. The same tale has been remade throughout the years, the most famous of which are the cowboy version The Magnificent Seven (1960) and the sci-fi anime version Samurai 7 (2004)."
jordondave-28085,"Nov 2, 2023",10/10,"(1954) Seven Samurai/ Shichinin no samurai
(In Japanese with English subtitles)
ACTION/ ADVENTUREAlmost four hours long which doesn't seem long at all because of my fascination about how other countries used to live and cope with poverty which can influence the way people live and converse with other people is fascinating. The cultural difference in which we can look at ourselves in the mirror and appreciate living on a society where there is always food available as opposed to other countries that are still struggling to find any is still going on in certain parts of the world like in North Korea and now Haiti. And the concept of offering what little food they have to samurai-to-hire to protect there helpless village is brilliant. In addition, Kurosawa also influenced several other films about involving groups of 7 or more teams fighting alongside starting with ""The Magnificent Seven"" to ""The Wild Bunch"", to ""The Professionals"". The seventh of sixteen films director Akira Kurosawa collaborated with Toshiro Mifune."
stevebintley,"Jan 19, 2021",3/10,"I really struggle with all the reviews saying what a great film this is. I found it incredibly slow throughout, with terrible acting and a story which was hardly gripping. None of that is helped either by the sheer length of the film, it just gone on and on and on. Okay it's almost seventy years old so I'll give it some slack but I clearly missed a hidden plot, because it was wasted on me!"

ABigHat,"Jan 17, 2023",10/10,"Three-and-a-half hour long epic and not a wasted scene throughout.There are some movies that are taught in film school and that you've heard from snobs to be the greatest ever. The former are usually films that contain aspects to further a lesson. The latter can be pretentious to the point of alienating the audience. Then there's a film like Seven Samurai.It's technically and artistically perfect. The characters are developed, the plot thickens and propels the story forward and the action is both thrilling to watch and integral.There's a reason that it's been remade and reimagined in so many different ways. Go see it, I can't imagine a person who wouldn't like it."
Mengui87,"Dec 30, 2022",10/10,"In my path to complete the TOP IMDB 250, I left the longest movies to the very end. That is how I ended up watching most of Akira Kurosawa's catalogue. I always heard wonders of Seven Samurai and how became some sort of catalyst for Asian Cinema and the Chambara genre.All the flowers and praise you'll read and hear about this movie are well desrerved. The cinematography, the story, the acting (one of the most unique performances in Mifune's career) and the influence in modern cinema makes this a most watch movie.Probably the best movie Kurosawa has made.Independently of genres and your preferences, please take the time to watch this movie. As a movie fan, you deserve it."
aidaneccleston,"Apr 26, 2024",7/10,"So I just finished watching 'Seven Samurai' and yeah, it's got some seriously epic battles and a cool crew of warriors. The way these guys come together to protect a village is pretty legendary. The action scenes are intense and well choreographed, making it feel like you're right there in the thick of it. Plus, each samurai has their own style and vibe, which keeps things interesting as their backstories unfold.But, honestly, the movie is super long, and there were parts that just felt like they dragged on forever. It's a solid 7/10 for me because while the fight scenes are awesome and the characters are memorable, the pacing could've been way better. The story's great and all, but it could have been told in less time. If you're into old-school action and don't mind a bit of a slow burn, then it's worth a watch, but be ready for a long sit."

If you only think of yourself, you'll only destroy yourself""Tale of seven ostracised samurais defending a farmers' village from a ruthless group of bandits may come off simplistic upon initial observance. However, the true brilliance of the movie lies in its execution, which is mounted on a humongous scale.And such grandeur does prompt query on how such technical mastery might have been attained seventy years ago.Back then, technology was primitive, and filmmakers must have faced dearth of resources. Despite these challenges, Kurosawa managed to bring his vision to life. The film stands as a technical marvel, if nothing else!"
dc_follies,"Mar 14, 2005",4/10,"I decided to check out Seven Samurai after reading the rave reviews on this site and being exhausted with all of the lack of quality that Hollywood seems to give us from year to year. I can enjoy most styles of movies, with the notable exceptions of the love story/chick flick and slasher movies, so the samurai genre is an available genre for me. The movie was okay, but not great. Three and a half hours is much too long for a relatively simple story without truly deep character development that gets you far into any one of their minds, perhaps because of the large number of ""main"" characters. The result for me was that I couldn't genuinely care about many, if any, of them. The cinematography, I felt, was average, especially for an ""action"" movie - this is what separates Citizen Kane by leaps and bounds from Seven Samurai (also check out the first 3.5 minute, no-cut shot in Touch of Evil). I need to go back and watch this film again, but do not have high hopes for the return trip. Again, the film was decent, but definitely not worth the accolades that it has received on IMDb.1-11-06 Okay, I have seen it again and am not impressed. I don't see anything exceptional about this film and it isn't entertaining either, so you might want to save some of your time and skip this one."
smits59,"Dec 26, 2006",10/10,"Let me first say: the seven samurai is a very gripping movie. There is hardly a moment in the movie that is not absolutely worth your time, which is quite a feat for a movie that is over three hours long.But the movie is not perfect. Like in most older Japanese movies the characters are almost cartoon-like, and so is their behavior. So much even that you can watch the Japanese-language version, which you should, without subtitles and still understand everything that is going on. The genius of Kurosawa gets away with it. Almost any other director would not have been able to make a serious movie in such a cartoon-style. And then there is the goofs. People switch positions when viewpoints change back and forth. People get stabbed again and again and still walk away as if tickled by a feather. How does this fit a movie in which every shot is supposed to be handcrafted?None the less, this is a wonderful movie and a landmark in movie-history. But one should see all of the movie and not just it's magic. So in my opinion The Seven Samurai is a very intense, very worthwhile movie. But it's not flawless."
anthony_retford,"Dec 5, 2009",10/10,"I really like this movie and have seen it several times, but each time I have to question why the bandits would attack a defended village. They had pillaged it before an unknown number of times and each time would have just ridden in and taken what they wanted. This time was radically different. Gone were the straightforward accesses and in place were flooded areas, stout fences, and Samauri. I would have to say the bandit leader was lacking in marbles. Why not just ride on to the next village and plunder that one? Why engage a formidable enemy and risk losing any men at all? At any rate had I been a rider I would have ridden the other way once the fighting began and not stick with an idiot who called himself the leader."
world_forest_bug888,"Feb 9, 2006",10/10,"Its sad really, sad the way teens with their pop crap go off watching something like 2 Fast 2 Furious and stick their two thumbs up because its ""in"" and then they see this movie and just because it has no color and no English it ""bad"". I actually think that it being black and white and devoid from the English language makes it just that bit better.But enough about stupid teenagers heres my review.This was the first Akira Kurosawa film I had seen and the fact that it went for 3 and a half hours kind of put me off. But nevertheless I was convinced to see it and when I did I tried my hardest not to blink because I would miss one nanosecond of a great film. The music was superb, story was even more superb and has been remade many times (Magnificent Seven, A Bugs Life etc.) and the action sequences didn't rely on flashy cgi crap to make me totally into it. Toshiro Mifune is positively wonderful and god I could go on.But alas no great film is great without cons. Please wait a few hours while I see if there are any. The fight sequence with the bamboo sticks in the town took too long both with the swords and bamboo. The sub story with Katsuhiro and Manzos daughter was unnecessary. But other than that the film was perfect! So if you're into crap like House of Wax because it has Paris Hilton in it destroy the DVD or video of it and watch Shichinin no Samurai over and over until you get that stupid I'll watch bad movies because its ""in"" idiocy out of your head and watch something cultured.(Apologies to those who are pro teen and like 2 Fast 2 Furious or House of Wax)"
Matt_Layden,"Dec 16, 2005",10/10,"A village is constantly attacked by well armed bandits. One day after an attack they seek the wisdom of an elder who tells them they cannot afford weapons, but they can find men with weapons, samurai, who will fight for them, if they find samurai who are in down on their luck and wondering where their next meal will come from. They find a very experienced samurai with a good heart who agrees to recruit their party for them. He selects five genuine samurai and one who is suspect but the seven return to the village to protect it from the forty plus bandits.If you could only watch one film in your lifetime, this one is it. Yes that's a pretty bold statement, but it's true. Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a must see for any film fan. Kurosawa brought so many elements together for this film that it is on such a grand an epic scale.Each samurai has their own arc to them, from being the experienced warrior to a young hopeful. Kurosawa takes his time to develop each character on his/her own terms and it works wonderfully. The film is extremely long and the epic battler doesn't take place till the final part of the film, but here we get to know our Seven Samurai, all of them, very well. We care for each, not wanting them to die in the heat of the battle, for a film to be able to do this for one character is great, but for seven....is extraordinary.Samurai is a dazzlingly technical achievement for it's time and to this day outshines most ""epic"" movies we see today. It has beautiful cinematography and art direction. Kurosawa has a keen eye and uses it well in this film.Samurai has one of if not the most amazing battle put to screen. The samurai turn the village into a fortress and use the surroundings to their help. The battle is so massive it spawns roughly 30 some odd minutes. The climatic battle itself goes through every rock that mother nature throws it's way, from the cold dirty rain to the hot dry day. It has influenced all the films we see today, The Return of The King, The Magnificent Seven, Narnia. Please don't see this film expecting BRAVEHEART, because there will be no limbs flying off the screen. But the action is beautifully filmed and shows early use of slow-motion.Samurai packs an emotional punch at the end, as it shows how the samurai are honorable, we have been on this journey with them since their beginning to their end and we cannot help but feel sorrow for the ones lost in the battle. We feel sorrow for the Samurai because in the end they get nothing, yes the village is safe and the enemy is gone, but the only thing the samurai get is a loss in numbers.Samurai is a landmark film that has it's place in history as one of the greatest. For those that can't comprehend it, think of it as Japan's Citizen Kane....only better. For a film that has inspired so many and given us so much, there is only praise to be said. For if it were not for this film, we may not be where we are today in cinema."
TheTheatreKidFrom90s,"Jan 19, 2010",6/10,"My favorite Kurosawa film is Throne of Blood, Hidden Fortress follows it and the third is Ran or Ikiru. As for Seven Samurai, In IMDb, the ratings higher than 8.5 are almost equal to 10 which means a masterpiece. I don't complain about the duration of the movies and if I feel sleepy or get bored (even if I get bored very rarely), I give up watching and watch the rest of the film the next day! However, the problem here is a bit different. The film was unnecessarily long for such a story. That causes it to lose its effect minute by minute. A group of farmers in a village decide to hire a few retired samurai to get rid of the racketeers. It would be great, if such a simple story had been told in 100 minutes. Unfortunately, Seven Samurai is one of the longest movies of all time! I mean the DVD version, I guess that the number of the people who got a chance to see the international version is not many. I forgot the main story totally after a while, loosed my attention. the story was scattered. Secondly, Seven Samurai is not artistic like other Kurosawa movies, it is the most pale, the most plain Kurosawa film ever. The content is so pale also, the story telling is pale. You watch, watch, watch and watch... By the way, some people say that Seven Samurai is an action film. There is only one action sequence in the whole film which takes place near the end!!! and it was pretty short. Therefore mind!, don't expect an action movie or a real samurai movie. This is a drama about Japanese farmers and a group of Samurai. In Ikiru, the last part had seemed me excessive or unnecessary either and made me think that sometimes, Kurosawa extends the story unnecessarily, but then I realized that the part was the heart of the film (İkiru) so I changed my mind. However, I would not say the same thing for Seven Samurai. It was too excessive like its rating."
spicysovereignty,"May 27, 2019",10/10,"This is a film to be studied, ruminated over, and revered.Its deft intertwining of epic action and complex characters allows to stand among few others in the category of 'a film to end all films'. Not only does it manage this mix superbly, but it's ability to create striking imagery allows it a sort of mythic quality, only enhanced by its plot.When it comes down to it, this film can stand with the legends of old as a story to be venerated.Thank you for your time."
fog-9,"Dec 16, 2005",7/10,"I'm going to start this off by saying I'm not a professional, so my understanding of camera work and cinematography is at layman's levels. However, I think this movie is somewhat overrated. The visuals are impressive and the movie has a more modern feel to it then other movies from the same time. I definitely think it's worthwhile seeing.But I don't agree that the characters are fleshed out. Perhaps a student of Asian history would find this movie fascinating, but if all sorts of important exchanges are happening under the surface, I missed most of them. I suppose it is too much to expect the director to spell out aspects of Japanese life and educate us, but without that, I found the characters stiff caricatures of little interest to me. Much the same as Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon (although the two movies are VERY different).The movie is simply far too long. While those visuals I mentioned are amazing, I think the editing is horrible. I enjoyed it up to the two hour mark but I knew I was running on empty after that. It suffers the from the same bloating that occurred in older American movies like Gone with the Wind. I know what you're thinking: He has no attention span and is amused by music videos from the MTV era. Well, I do tend to like shorter poems. Why? Brevity is a rare and powerful force. Things should be as long as they need to be. I have enjoyed longer features, and I'm a great fan of movies with slow, beautiful scenes. But this movie collapsed under its own weight.I know many people will disagree, and I might appear foolish to say this, but I don't think foreign films are necessarily better then Hollywood films. The pendulum seems to swing both ways when it comes to this matter, people defending foreign movies as vastly superior to ""mainstream"" movies, or running them down simply because they have to read subtitles and move outside their comfort zone. I don't think foreign status is enough to elevate this movie beyond the ranks of many other good adventure/action movies. With some prudent editing, script revision and greater depth in portrayal, it might even have been great."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jul 22, 2006",3/10,"This 1954 Akiro Kuroswa-directed film has legendary status among critics. It was the forerunner for the western hit ""The Magnificent Seven.""Knowing these facts, I was anxious to see it. Wow, what a letdown! Yes, it had some nice photography but the story was way too slow-moving to sustain interest. It took FOREVER to get to the main action scene. By then, it was too late; I had lost interest. The film runs 160 minutes and can seem longer.So many of these Kurosawa films are overrated by the critics. Maybe it's not politically-correct to criticize this man's work, it's not the ""thing to do,"" so they keep telling everyone what great films like this are, hooking unsuspecting people like me into wasting my time and money on them..I wanted to like this, but I have to be honest, too. If you thinking of purchasing this, sight-unseen (especially with an expensive Criterion price) , don't say I didn't warn you."
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 10, 2011",N/A,"I am embarrassed to say this, but before watching ""Seven Samurai"", the only Akira Kurosawa movie that I had seen was ""Yojimbo"" (which was definitely a good one; it was the inspiration for ""A Fistful of Dollars""). But now I've seen what is probably Kurosawa's all-time masterpiece. This look at a group of men who come to the aid of a besieged town during the Warring States Period of Japan has it all: perfect direction, incredible cinematography, and even more.Probably the best scene is when Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) addresses the other six samurai and proclaims ""If you seek to help others, you have saved yourself. If you only think of yourself, then you only destroy yourself."" That should be the ultimate lesson for all mankind in all endeavors. Regardless, this is a movie that you can't afford to miss. I have yet to see ""The Magnificent Seven"", but I have seen ""Three Amigos!"". I certainly hope to see more Kurosawa movies.Another movie set during Japan's Warring States Period that I recommend is Kenji Mizoguchi's ""Ugetsu"", about the effect that war has on people."
russian-movie-fan,"May 22, 2008",8/10,"So whats all the hype about this movie? I've watched literally thousands of movies in my life and decided to see this one. Well, in 2008 its dated and very quaint. There are two impressive things about the movie that today's audiences will appreciate. 1) The use of camera close-ups on faces to accentuate plot points and tense scenes. 2) The use of camera to film action sequences in the last 30 minutes of the movie. Those are the best things in the movie and were revolutionary in its time. So for historical purposes, one can argue that this was important. However, these two novel techniques don't overshadow the fact that the movie is slow in its pacing, runs much too long with quite a few irrelevant scenes (the girl-boy in the woods scenes are out of place). In fact, another problem with this movie, is that for western audiences much of the context surrounding the life of the samurai and Japanese life are simply absent. Without any historical knowledge one is left w/many questions about the actions of the characters in the movie and the motives behind them. In short, it is a good movie that you should watch once for its historical significance, but there is not much that you can take away from it (as a modern viewer). There are too many action movies that have come along that are much better filmed and more captivating than this movie. Like a one-shot wonder resting on his laurels, this movie keeps getting more famous as the years go by for some novel features that it introduced. Although captivating for its time, by today's standards this piece of cinema is simply good but not great."
ChristianRussberg,"Mar 1, 2021",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's ultimate masterpiece. An epic that does everything a movie can do, and does it all to near perfection. And though it is long, it justifies its running time completely; every strand of plot, every piece of dialogue, every single shot, is ultimately paid off in the dramatic second half.The ending, perhaps one of the best in all of cinema, is a bittersweet conclusion to a truly epic adventure that should leave no doubts in one's mind that this is indeed a special movie. In my opinion, the best ever."
eddie_baggins,"Jul 15, 2020",9/10,"Changing the landscape of cinema forever, Seven Samurai is a monumental film for the industry, with Akira Kurosawa's meticulously crafted action epic setting the tone not only for how films were shot moving forward but also setting up the now well-worn trope of groups banding together for a common cause, that allowed beloved favorites such as The Dirty Dozen, Western riff The Magnificent Seven and even The Avengers to be born into existence.Shot over a grueling 148 day period and finalized far over its initial budget, Samurai was a mammoth undertaking not only by the standards of the day in which is was made but by modern day standards also, as Kurosawa would leave no stone unturned in creating his dream project that harked back to his own families heritage to the samurai warriors and his nations rich history of conflicts and over comings.Set mostly in a stunningly made set that recreated the rural setting of Japanese farming life in the 1500's, Samurai embeds us into the lives of a group of farming families who are fearful of their lives at the hands of marauding bandits that threaten their otherwise peaceful existence, so much so that they come to the conclusion they must seek the help of skillful samurai to protect and defend their village and put a stop to the reign of terror that has engulfed their daily routines.Paced without an ounce of rush or hurry (the film clocks in at an intermission held 3 hours and 27 minutes), Kurosawa takes his time establishing each and every one of the eventual seven able bodied men that band together as one to help train and protect the village people, with the film giving that rare chance for all of its core characters to have their moment in the spotlight as we learn to understand their various motivations and traits as the film builds towards its more action packed final hour that features some of the era's most memorable set-pieces and directional choices.Heralded as a favorite of many directors that we know and love today (Star Wars master George Lucas credits the film as his favorite of all time), Samurai's handling of its ensemble, lead by scene stealing Kurosawa partner in crime Toshirô Mifune as the loud-mouthed Kikuchiyo and Takashi Shimura as the Yoda like master of the group Kambei Shimada, the way in which events transpire throughout Samurai's simple but also layered plot are ground-breaking for the time and while lesser in impact and nature today thanks to so many years of film following in its wake, still make for mostly gripping viewing throughout.There are elements of the film that haven't aged as well as other components, some of the supporting performances are prone to overacting that was prevalent in the time period and there is a sense at times that a tighter cut of certain scenes could've helped the flow of the film but with its stunning cinematography courtesy of Asakazu Nakai (so many shots of this film could be transported straight to a painting/image on your wall), beautifully crafted surrounds designed by production designer Takashi Matsuyama and art director Sô Matsuyama, Kurosawa's ageless piece of art is deserving of its reputation as a grandfather of the cinema we now devour and love today.Final Say -It may not be the perfect film but Seven Samurai is the work of a once in a life time master who pushed the boundaries so that others who followed in his wake had a rule-book on how cinema could be done and worlds crafted to ones endless imagination and inspiration.4 1/2 rice balls out of 5"
hadisamadzad,"Mar 22, 2012",9/10,"The file is story of seven samurai that help weak farmers against bandits attacks for a intangible reason. No one knows why does some of those samurais come to the group.There is a myth in Iranian's folklore myths has named ""Chor_oghli"". ""Chor_oghli"" is a hero in ""Azerbayjan"" (a Province of Iran), for first time when he familiarized with gun as a new killer weapon that could hurt from a distance, he said: ""This is beginning of cowardice age."" In this nice story all of 4 samurai were killed by GUN and in my opinion it is The most important point in ""Seven Samurai"" story. they were very skilled swordsmen, but they hadn't any idea about gun.For these samurais morality and power are important Together."
jahanson2001,"Apr 29, 2006",10/10,"I found this movie intense, humorous and very entertaining.Whenever I start to watch a movie with my wife, the first thing she wants to know is how long is it. I never look at the time and when I was about 90 minutes into it, she wanted to know...hehehe to my surprise, I was less than half way done! That goes to show you that there is really no dull or uninteresting portion of this movie. I would say that the first 15 minutes is about the slowest but it does take some time to develop characters. I was never bored and the comic relief was wonderful.Hope you enjoy it as much as I did and be sure to come back and vote for it!"
Ishallwearpurple,"Jan 18, 2005",6/10,"---to slog (I use that word advisedly-lots of rain and mud) through the long, almost 4 hour movie. I had burgundy.After taping this film off TCM months ago, I finally sat down to watch it on a cold, gray day, and was bored to tears. At the intermission, I decided to give it a rest until the next day.Picking up the story on day two, I found it a little more exciting, but really, the story of the 7 guys joining up to help poor villagers fight off bandits is only as interesting as the characters are revealed. And these guys are just not that interesting. As a 1954 film, the style is for very long takes where we just see someone grimacing or staring or standing or whatever. And lots of running around to no purpose. Please! That is not good. It is a ""moving"" picture, for goodness sake, but should make some sense.Maybe it is a generational thing, or gender. As an older woman, I just did not care what happened by ""the end."" One of the ""classics"" that I confess, I don't 'get.'My rating: first part - 5/10: intermission music - 7/10: second part - 7/10: overall rating - 6/10 (worth a look - but be warned. Long and slow)"
artkozak,"Dec 12, 2004",1/10,"You are joking?? This is way overrated due to those who want to sound more clever and pretend they actually enjoy something that is ever so slow and long. In fact, this movie has lost any kind of interest. No it has not aged well at all!! Believe me, I like some black and white movies such as Charlie Chaplin's, or even that recent Pie (the number)one. The other day I watched King Kong, and however clumsy the special effects of the time were, it only gives a special dated kick to it (and some of the dinosaurs fight are quite surprisingly awesome as you get used to the general texture of the time.With this one you are just in for boredom and disappointment. It's almost silent for three and a half hours and the fights are theatrically overacted it is ridiculous. Sure this movie was something in 1954, before Star Wars, Aliens, Lord of the rings and Akira (among others), but I believe that to actually enjoy that one, you would need to be a historian of cinema, with a strong knowledge of everything that was happening surrounding the movie, which might provide you with a light that I haven't found.I don't see the point! There does seem to be a consensus that the age of a movie compensates for its shortcomings. I don't think so!! It certainly is part of the reason, but it doesn't make it less boring!So come on! A really great movie should stand the test of time! And that sure means that this one is crap.Equip yourself with popcorn and beer if you are to watch it anyway, it might keep you some company!"
rmax304823,"Nov 28, 2003",N/A,"I won't go on about this except to say I recommend it without qualifications.It is the fons et origo of so many Westerns.  Slow-motion deaths were introduced to the screen here.  But then, everything here was pretty much original, an updated Iliad.  Two groups of warriors standing a few feet apart, shaking spears at one another, the only thing missing being Hector.But then too it is an alegory of WWII.  The samurai may have weaknesses -- they're only human after all -- but they are governed by a code of honor. And when they die it is in a noble cause or because they and their swords are outmatched by modern weapons like rifles (or atomic bombs).If I can make an outrageous generalization (and I can), China is known for its innovations, and Japan is known for adapting those innovations and perfecting them -- whether lacquered bowls or weapons of war.  (The poor Koreans are left somewhere in between, known mainly for kim chee.)Akira Kurosawa was a fine director and an intelligent man.  He not only perfected the genre of the samurai movie but put Shakespeare up there on the screen with the best of them -- ""Throne of Blood,"" which is MacBeth, and ""Ran,"" which is King Lear.  Kurosawa was both a craftsman and an artist and this is one of his better works."

Eddie C.,"Jan 2, 1999",10/10,"I have several laserdiscs at home (I only recently purchased a DVD player)and many are films that I see occasionally when I first buy them, then never see them again for a long time. The CAV version of Seven Samurai is a film that draws me back time and time again. It's a damn shame too many people refuse to see it because it isn't in English! I taped a copy for my cousin in New Jersey, and although I gave it my highest recommendation, he still has not seen it to this day.It's easier to focus on the few flaws of this film than to try to pinpoint what makes this film great. Katsushiro still seems incredibly wimpy for a samurai, and if you see this film in an art-house theatre the subtitles may not be as good as the ones on the Criterion version. It disturbed me that Rickichi's wife would rather commit suicide than come home to her husband--it wasn't HER fault the bandits kidnapped and raped her.But that's about it for naysaying. Not only are the action scenes terrific, but Kurosawa does a great job establishing the character of the samurai and peasants. You don't see a villain with a dynamic personality (as in ""The Magnificent Seven"") but Kurosawa is more interested in the relationship between the samurai and the peasants. One of the things the viewer learns is that many peasants think of samurai (in general) as merely bandits with higher breeding. The villagers are not saintly victims in this film, and the samurai are not superhuman swordsmen. Because the viewer gets to KNOW the characters in this film, their deaths have a greater impact than they do in the American version.If you haven't seen this film before, I both pity and envy you. I pity that you haven't been fortunate enough to see this film before, but I envy the fact that you will soon see it for the first time."
i.soujun,"Jul 5, 1999",10/10,"i watched ""yojimbo"" and ""a fistfull of dollars"". i watched ""rashomon"" and ""the outrage"". having done so, i can compare them, and say that all are great films (although kurosawa's originals are, of course, superior to the remakes).but after watching ""seven samurai"" and ""the magnificent seven"" i found myself unable to make a comparison. ""magnificent"" is a good movie; with yul, eli et al it almost had to be. but ""seven samurai"" is on another level entirely. when i attempt to produce adjectives that fit this work, i fail. it is, in my opinion, better than all other movies in almost every way.kurosawa is something beyond brilliant, and mifune is mesmerizing (to say nothing of shimura and the rest of the outstanding cast). this film overwhelms all applicable senses, and is as emotionally effective and affecting as...i don't know...real life."
inevitabilio,"Feb 14, 2006",10/10,"If words true classic have a meaning, this meaning will fit to the movie. It is black and white, it is old, it contains atmosphere and heroes from another time(yet still applicable), the morals and the mode are even little bit nostalgic. Sorry for the ""olds"", it is timeless. The typical wit, courage and color of the Kurosawa characters is so outstanding that I think if he could make the movie now in color you would need about 30 seconds to recognize his hand. I also think the actors helped him a lot. It is a timeless and simple story, yet deeply touched by sensitive details. Do not watch this move if you want cheap effects, suspense and action. But if you want a truly touching story to raise your spirits this is what you should watch."
corn-6,"Oct 28, 2002",6/10,"While this movie is a pioneer of the action film and has some great cinematography and direction, I found myself bored for long sections of the movie.  While many in the film are good actors, some of the supporting actors are ridiculously broad and hammy.  Good film, but not really anything I'd care to sit through again."
royalassassin603,"Dec 12, 2007",4/10,"This movie is a good movie. It is well made, has a great storyline, has good acting and is interesting. It is a novelty, for sure. The problem with this movie is that it was made over 50 years ago and that wears on action movies. On movies like Casablanca, Gone with the Wind, It's a Wonderful Life etc. etc. They are timeless, they don't put a big emphasis on special effects and action scenes. This movie relies on them! And while I am sure that they were state-of-the-art in 1954, the action scenes are boring, by today's standards. I know people will take offense to this, but try showing this movie to anyone who doesn't have prior knowledge of Kirosawa's reputation. They won't like this movie."
cokelucas,"May 5, 2004",10/10,"I hate it when people say that 'the magnificent seven' is so great and have never even heard of The Seven Samurai. It's amazing how many of the scenes are exactly the same, i.e. the scene in which Toshiro Mifune's character catches a fish with his own hands. I could watch this movie everyday and never get sick of it, which is a credit to the film direction. I use this film to judge a persons character, in friendship and even relationships. If a person can't sit and watch this film then what could they offer? I think the only movie to match this epic is the return of the king. I think this movie teaches us a lot about life, most importantly, never trust farmers."
Ripe Peach,"Jan 18, 2001",10/10,"I'm currently going through a bit of an anti-Hollywood period, being just sick to the back teeth of the likes of Tom ""Earnest"" Hanks and Adam ""Dribbling Idiot"" Sandler substituting mugging and grimacing for acting, and directors using loud bangs and look-at-meeeeeee effects in lieu of actually bothering to try and involve the viewer in the film.So, fresh from the astonishing Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, I decided to give ""7 Samurai"" (English subtitle version) another viewing, and was not disappointed.  Samurai is a simple film; the characters are quickly established, the plot is small scale, the dialog is realistic but fairly terse, and the shots are clear rather than overtly clever.  But in this case, the simplicity is most definitely a virtue, and it hides a painstaking process.  Kurosawa decides precisely what he wants to shoot, and then shoots it precisely as he wants it.The result is a gripping film in which the heroism of the samurai is all the more involving because there is a real sense of their humanity and mortality.  There are few surprises in the outcome, but Kurosawa makes us actually care about the journey as much as, or even more than, the destination.Compare with Tarantino, and contrast with the standard Hollywood style of a eight or nine showcase events leading linearly to a neat conclusion, with the ""talky bits"" squeezed in in a seemingly ad hoc fashion.  Such blockbusters can be fun, but they are ultimately uninvolving; Samurai leaves images in your mind that will last a lifetime."
austinbirdman,"Jan 17, 2006",10/10,"The Seven Samurai is without doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. It has humor (which translates from Japanese, even five decades after the production), outstanding action, depth, realism, great characters, a classic dramatic climax, and one of the most moving sequences in all of film (when the character played by Toshiro Mifune reveals his secret), in addition to many unforgettable scenes.While the movie is deep and philosophically rich, it is also highly accessible. The story is so well told visually that my daughter was complete absorbed in it at age four (she actually woke me up the next morning to watch the final sequence -- ""The Bandits! We have to see what happened to the Bandits!"") and she still asks to see it every few months. The action, bandits, heroes, and love story all caught her fancy -- and imagine what it's like if you can actually read the subtitles. My point is, if a four-year-old can get into it, so can anyone.This film stands as a testament to the true power of cinema. It is one of the masterpieces of film-making and of 20th-century art. Wonderful on first viewing, it becomes better and better each time it is enjoyed. The film simply succeeds on all of its levels -- as the epitome of the action-genre Western (and its Japanese cousin, the Samurai movie), as Shakespearian drama with a blend of high and low art, as epic cinema, as realistic period drama, as an example of Kurosawa's artistry, his camera-work and editing, and as a vehicle for timeless acting from the major stars.It's sad that Americans see so few foreign films (without considering perhaps that most of the world is foreign) -- this one should not be missed."
CoolyB,"Apr 10, 1999",10/10,"Being a young filmmaker, I am constantly trying to discover films that can teach me how to push the boundaries of my imagination. I also need to be inspired by the power of the human spirit. Furthermore, because of my struggles in the ""business"" of making film, I need to constantly be reminded of the poetry of making personal films even if they are epic by theme and nature.Seven Samurai provides me with all of the above. A simple but beautiful story that contains some of the most memorable characters and character combinations I've ever seen in film. The characters are so rich that you could devote an entire movie to each of them.I sat in awe as I watched it for the first time on a digitally restored version on DVD.  Criterion did an amazing job in its restoration of the film. If you ever get a chance please watch it on DVD, which contains a section which compares the original and restored versions. They showed a scene, which lasted no longer than a minute where they had to remove 3500 particles! The difference is amazing.When I watch Mifune on screen I think immediately of Kurosawa. When I think of two of them it immediately brings to mind other great collaborations; Fellini and Mastroianni (and Masina); Bergman and Von Sydow; Scorcese and De Niro. It's rare when you have the greatest actor and director working together at their genius peak. It's almost as if the two were one leading their cinematic cavalries on film, and somehow, neither of them could have been as great on their own.I also have to comment on Kurosawa's collaboration with his cinematographer Asakazu Nakai.  Even though the film is about the outcastes of the time, their camera captures the poetic beauty of humanity and nature working together.I went to Japan last year and I am now ashamed that I didn't visit Kurosawa's grave. I am indebted to his contribution to cinema and his influence on my dream."
jgcorrea,"Dec 14, 2022",10/10,"In sixteenth-century Japan, ravaged by civil wars, some farmers hire seven samurai to defend themselves from brigands. By overcoming class barriers, the mercenaries will sympathize with the farmers and sacrifice themselves for them: in the end, the wise samurai leader (Shimura) pronounces the sentence: «Once again we have lost... they are the real winners». An epic adventure film that hides an elegy of the earth and solidarity, as in the director's humanitarian spirit.Kambei (Shimura) is wisdom and disenchantment (capable of underlining the self-destructive nature of the enterprise), Heihachi and Gorobei (Chiaki and Inaba) are cunning, joviality, common sense , Kyuzo (Miyaguchi) is the ascetic concentration, Katsushiro (Kimura) represents the enthusiasm of youth, generosity and idealism, Shichiroj (Kato) is the professionalism that wants to remain in the shadows, Kikuchiyo (Mifune) is the character who links the upper and the lower cultures with his peasant origins and his choice to become a samurai by will.Much imitated, never surpassed, 7 Samurai covers much emotional, historical, and cinematic ground. Rich in detail, vivid in characterization, leisurely in exposition, this 207-minute epic is bravura filmmaking - a synthesis of Hollywood pictorialism, Soviet montage, and Japanese theatricality."
sandeepsreeju,"Aug 3, 2023",10/10,"""Seven Samurai"" is one of the most exciting, suspenseful films I've ever seen, and the running time passed so quickly that I wasn't even ready for the film to be over. Just a perfect movie from beginning to endThis is one of those few movies that tells a whole story from start to finish without any delays or plot holes. It is all understandable and easy to grasp. The three and half hour film flew by with no drags or any sign of boredom. I was engulfed by it.This film is rightly considered one of the greatest films in the history of cinema. Apart from the fact that it is technically perfect, this is one of the most influential films of all time. From today's perspective, the film tells a story that has been seen many times."
Krusty-14,"Jun 4, 2000",7/10,"This movie shows some of the best directing ever done, and is a historical masterpiece for that reason, and that reason alone.  Seven Samurai is not very relevant to the modern world, especially in America.  Very little is done to develop characters and themes.  At best, this is a simple story which was stretched out to 3 1/2 hours.I do agree that the directing and cinematography were groundbreaking and very ahead of their time.  I'm sure that the dialogue lost quite a bit of meaning and complexity in translation.  The subtitles are written at an 8-year old's reading level, and do not do well in expressing emotion or meaning.  There are other cultural barriers which will prevent the average viewer from fully grasping the plot.The characters are, at best, underdeveloped.  It is quite possible to go through the whole movie without even knowing the main characters' names, let alone the intricacies of their personality.  However, you will certainly see the influence this film had on today's directing.  Overall, I give it a 7/10...but I would probably give a better rating to the shortened version."
fclarkehearn,"Sep 18, 2023",10/10,"Those who gave this film a 7 and below must have Lissencephaly. It's a masterpiece, everything about it is perfect. Every frame a painting has never been more apparent while watching this beautiful display of artwork on my screen. Tishiro mifune was perfect in this film. Watching other Kurosawa films like yojimbo for example wouldn't make you think mifune could pull of such a character...but he did and did it amazingly. Each character was perfectly played and every shot was perfectly shot by akira Kurosawa. Unless films are not your thing I. E your favourite film is a marvel one. Then you probably will not appreciate this film. But if you have a base line love for cinema this will indefinitely enter your top 10 of all time."

At hour two, is was really bored and fought sleep. And at the end, after the pretty pointless ending, i was really disappointed.I don't know how someone living in the 21st century can give this film more than 3 points. It's so damn boring! The story is pointless. And the acting: Every actor in a decent suburb playhouse can act like this (but surely won't, because it's way to stagy).Conclusion: Heavily overrated, save this three hours of your life. Now it's down from #1 to #11 ... and hopefully will continue to descend."
eibon09,"Feb 26, 2001",N/A,"Shichinin no Samurai/Seven Samurai(1954) is a beautifully shot dramatic action picture.  Its about farmers who hire seven ronin warriors to help rid them of bandits.  Seven Samurai(1954) is an epic that's enriched by its length.  One of the ten greatest motion pictures of all time.  The long length is helpful in development of character and plot.Seven Samurai(1954) changed the way action films were made in the cinema. The film focuses on things like friendship and teamwork in war.  The recruiting of the 7 samurai warriors is done with precise detail. Influenced every action film done after this.  Seven Samurai is a movie that I never get bored of watching.The acting in the feature is amazing to see.  Takashi Shimura gives a fine performance as the leader, Kambei.  Tatsuya Nakadai has a short role as a wandering samurai.  Kichijiro Veda is a formidable villain as the bandit leader.  Yoshiro Inaba is very good in the role of Gorobei Katayama.The direction by Akira Kurosawa is perhaps his best in a long line of great films.  He directs action and drama scenes with equal interest.  Akira Kurosawa with this film is someone that current filmmakers are in awe of. Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune make an excellent actor and director combo. The director also contributed to the brilliant editing.The battle scenes are a mixture of outstanding camera work and fantastic editing.  The Seven Samurai(1954) sets up the battle scenes beautifully and finishes with a payoff to remember.  The battle scene during the climax is exhilatrating to watch.  Akira Kurosawa has filmed many great battle scenes in his samurai pictures.  The battle scenes in Seven Samurai(1954) put similar scenes in Gladiator(2000) and The Patriot(2000) to shame.Toshiro Mifune is larger than life as the farmer turned samurai, Kikuchiyo. Its his performance as Kikuchiyo that made him a cinematic icon.  Gives a performance of chivalrous proportions with a dominating presence that is not easy to match.  Chow Yun Fat is the Toshiro Mifune of our generation. Kikuchiyo shows true courage as he sacrifices his life for the farmers he is hired to protect.Although remade into The Magnificent Seven(1961), the film that is closer in spirit to this picture is Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969).  Seven Samurai(1954) was one of the first modern films to use the slow motion effect.  Both films deal warriors and outlaws who end up fighting for a cause.  Also, in both films the theme of honor and sacrifice dominates the screen.  The Battle of Bloody Porch in The Wild Bunch(1969) is inspired by this film's climatic battle.The story is simple but compelling to understand.  The screenplay is perfectly written by Akira Kurosawa and Shinobu Hasimoto.  The story has an universal appeal that anyone can comprehend.  The story has been used and reused by directors like George Lucas and Ridley Scott.  Other film makers inspired by Seven Samurai include Sam Peckinpah, John Woo, Steven Speilberg, and Stanley Kubrick.Seven Samurai(1954), Ran(1984), and Throne of Blood(1957) are the director's three masterpieces.  The best way to see this film is in its complete 203 minute version.  Akira alternates serious sequences with scenes of humor. Gives a wonderful sense of the period the film takes place in.  A masterpiece with emotional performances and powerful set pieces.The farmers evolve from being in fear of the bandits to standing up to them with courage.  The samurai warriors also evolve from hired hands brought in to do a job to fighting for a honorable cause.  The film is a long three act play that never fails to entertain.  The techniques marvels of master filmmaking and outstanding visuals.  There is not a dull moment in the entire film."
DeanAmythe,"Nov 29, 2023",9/10,"One of those frustrating examples of finally checking out a highly acclaimed piece of cinema and being left with little more than appreciation for its legacy and the pure technical craft of it. I think the basis of this is as perfect of a story as it can get, but I was left utterly cold for way too much of this. Excessive in its length and populated with bland characters: I do appreciate how the samurai in question distinguish between themselves with different personality types but archetypes is frankly all they are (the most depth you can expect is 'forbidden romance' and 'troubled past'). There's also an issue I have that applies to my experience with other films from these older eras as well (which may very well just be a me-thing) where I tend to feel a lack of punctuation. Now, I'm not asking every film to be full-on Nolan and have everything try to be completely epic, in fact, I think he presents the other side of the punctuation coin in Oppenheimer with its constant blaring score and indulgent pacing -- when it's supposed to be quiet and slow down, it hardly does. It becomes a flatline of an experience. The opposite applies here: even when there's action, swords swinging, sheds burning, there's this ever-present sense of banality. Lots of instances where I numbly went ""oh, guess we're doing this now"". Maybe some of the setups got lost in translation (an announcement for a coming event)?The rating I'm giving here must seem entirely out of proportion considering how admittedly harsh I'm being on this, but as stated earlier there is still plenty to marvel at. Even by todays standards, the imagery is striking and technically it's still incredibly well put together. My higher rating is reflecting this 'objective' quality (whatever that may mean in your subjective perception of that term) because I don't think, even without considering the heafty runtime, I'll be revisiting this anytime soon."
SmileyMcGrouchpantsJrEsqIII,"Apr 30, 2020",10/10,"Coming around to this picture at 48 (there's a lot of catching up to do; I still having seen ""Serpico!""), I was impressed with how long ago this was made (1954) and with what care and attention to detail. Like so many masters, Kurosawa registers as one you have to feel slavish about and if you haven't seen enough of them in a barrage to almost become a filmmaker yourself, chances are there's plenty of this classic kicking around to catch up with if you've got plenty of time on your hands (as we find ourself these days!). Compelling, with both a gritty and epic feel as well as a grasp of class details of everyday life in this far-away time, this movie is wiling to follow every digression as though it was equally important -- as any military tactician can tell you, the key to success in everything from walking the perimeter to not forgetting intangibles and being willing to harbor any potential outcome as a possibilities. Frankly, this movie is as good for the kids as for the adults, because they're learning a lot of crap these days, and this picture puts you in a place where a lot of human life spills over -- including those in the film who do or don't value it, and what that means. View it with the ""Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" picture, one I liked but not quite as much, because, hey, you've got 6 hours to sit around, right? ""And he goes as if for a mushroom hunt ... "" Classic! Great times for people who can handle long attention spans, and don't fall asleep at ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" or cry about their college choice like there's anything they can do about it or it's anybody else's fault ... Eureka! :)"
LawfulRebellion,"Oct 7, 2019",9/10,"Granted, it's very long. Perhaps, the reason that many young people have never seen it. In my view, that should never be a barrier for a true film lover. The BFI Blu-Ray is presented in either two parts (as it would have been in cinemas, I presume) or in full without the intermission - so, no excuses 😏 watch it!There are many other Akira Kurosawa masterpieces to watch - I am working way through them at present - here are my favourites just now: Drunken Angel, Stray Dog, Rashomon, Throne Of Blood (Macbeth), The Hidden Fortress, The Bad Sleep Well, Yojimbo & Sanjuro, High and Low, Kagemusha, Ran. Do yourself and your immortal soul a favour; look for these films and if you're like me, you'll realise the sincere privilege of witnessing the work of a true master."
Mikey-45,"Oct 31, 1998",10/10,"I first saw part of this movie on public television in 1969. The picture quality on tv was marginal, but the film was strikingly different, and so had remained in my thoughts over the years.Two weeks ago, I watched Seven Samurai in its entirety (re-mastered on DVD) along with my wife. I do believe that it is the best film that I have ever seen. The director, Akira Kurosawa, uses the camera in a remarkable way. Individual scenes are beautiful, and memorable, and almost autonomous in their brilliance and quality. Slow motion, used only a few times, is extremely well done. Camera angles, camera movements, and frame-work show the genius of Mr. Kurosawa.The attention to detail on the movie set had me wondering more than once, 'how is it possible to film 16th century Japan when the camera had not yet been invented?'. Of course, the answer is obvious, but it showed to me the power of this movie to totally absorb the audience. I strongly recommend this movie to everyone, especially the DVD version."
eianson,"Mar 7, 2004",9/10,"I don't normally comment on films here, but I felt compelled to write a review given the number of recent bad reviews posted here.  I saw it today for the first time and this is a terrific film!Yes, it is long, but it is compelling the whole way through.  The characters are terrific, the cinematography is beautiful and the plot is one of the most influential in movie history.  I've recently seen The Magnificent Seven too and while I liked it alot, it is not as good as Seven Samurai.  I thing one thing people are missing is the context of when it was made.  People didn't make movies like this in 1954.  When I compare it to other classics of the same era (Treasure of the Sierra Madre, The Bridge on the River Kwai, On the Waterfront), it compares very favorably.  While I haven't seen any of Kurosawa's more modern films, my guess is he more than makes up for many of the criticisms listed by those here.Give this movie a shot.  Just recognize it is long and it was made a long time ago.10 out of 10.BTW...for all you LOTR fans, those film are HEAVILY influenced by this movie.Eric"
johnnymonsarrat,"Mar 30, 2002",6/10,"Let's get something straight: I'm an action movie guy. I like it when stuff blows up, and I don't have much tolerance for arty films or drama. Primarily, I don't have the refinement or the film school training to enjoy one aspect of the film (music score, costuming) when the rest of the movie is awful.So, like most people, I avoid the classics because most classics are B-A-D.But being an action movie buff, I checked out the Seven Samurai and it was pretty good. It was accessible to me, and while I can't at all agree that it's the best action movie of all time (a lot of stuff has blown up in the 50 years since this film came out), it was worth the risk.Who should see this film:-- Drama / arty types who need to flesh out their ""seen it"" credentials-- Action movie types who have nothing better to do on a rainy day. It will take a little willpower to get through, sort of like getting through those cheesy cop buddy flicks from the 1980s, but you can do that, right?I'll give ""The Seven Samurai"" a 5 out of 10."
GyatsoLa,"Jun 9, 2007",10/10,"OK, everything that can be said about this movie has already been said. I wouldn't normally give a 10 for a movie, as that implies perfection, and what is perfect? But the reality is that this movie deserves a 10 as it is quite simply the best action movie ever made. Before I saw this I thought Apocalypse Now and Das Boot could not be topped, but this movie does it. Almost every scene in it is stunning - the rhythm, the vitality of the movie is amazing. Its long - very long - but I didn't want it to end.Since i don't want to bore everyone with reiterating what everyone else has said about the cinematic technique here, I would just like to comment on one particular element - the realism of the battle scenes. In the overwhelming majority of action or war movies, fight scenes are in some way stylized. But it is clear from this movie and others Kurosawa made that he had in common with Stanley Kubrick a fascination with the techniques of battle (I'm thinking in particular of 'Spartacus'). He takes great care to show us the geography of the village - the hills to one side, the open fields, the forest to the edge. He shows us how real battle hardened warriors would approach its defense. He shows how men would be killed in reality - not dramatic man to man sword fights, but a ruthless strategy to isolate the weak, and overwhelm them, drain them of energy and hack them down. None of the samurai kill their opponents in dramatic set pieces - but the movie is so well made we don't notice that in fact almost all the bandits are either hacked up by the villagers, or stabbed in the back by the samurai, not killed face to face. This is, in truth, how most battles work. Its not noble, but its far more 'real' than lots of gushing blood and severed limbs."
Carrzinho,"Sep 3, 2019",7/10,"Well, some movies are labeled epic and this certainly falls into that category tipping the scales at 3hr 21min. It also falls into the Citizen Kane category in that its massively influential predating almost every western of note and every western in the grittier second wave including the Magnificent Seven which would transition from ""influenced by"" to practically remade. No shortage of pedigree then.
Seven Samurai are hired for the meagre price of food and board to save a poor village from the annual pillage (and rape) at the hands of a gang of 40 bandits. Each of the Seven samurai are well written and easily definable characters in their own right. The villagers are more homogenous but there are a few fleshed out a bit more to provide interest, pathos, humour or indeed a love interest.
While the main cast are generally convincing a huge amount of the ancillary roles are irritatingly overacted. There is plenty of good humour to be found but some of it verging on childlike. There are far too many ""by numbers"" moments that fail to give credit to the viewer in what is often a subtle piece of work.
While 3hr 21min is no doubt time consuming, i've never found it off putting. However, there's an effortless hour to be shaved off here. I never expected to learn so much about rural farming or geographical warfare tactics. The aforementioned Magnificent Seven manages to cut a full hour and 13 minutes without compromising a facsimile of the plot. It doesn't result in a better movie movie but it takes a good wedge of slog out of it. It also justifies the motivations of the ""heroes"" better than Kurosawa's version.
I mentioned Citizen Kane earlier specifically and could easily have mentioned perhaps Night of the Living Dead. These movies all have incredible legacies but while all very good they are not exceptional movies in their own right. They do remain essential viewing though. There is so much to love about pacing and characterisation, filming action, dealing with grim and gritty subject matter that it warrants your attention. It is also true that because it is so influential, that many of the idea's and stylings have been more successfully implemented in latter years and likely in movies you've seen. So at times you'll find yourself watching this movie more for how it has influenced movies thereafter than for the movie itself.
In summation if you're a cinephile tick off a box here. If you're looking for what is a high calibre western try The Wild Bunch or The good, The Bad and the Ugly. If you want to experience Kurosawa, i'd argue that it's not even his best work, preferring Yojimbo or Rashomon myself. SEVEN"
danson-4,"Jul 21, 2006",5/10,"I gave this movie a 5. Beats me how this got as high as it has on the top 250, I can't see any reason to give this movie anywhere close to a 10. As far as samurai movies goes, it was okay. Very authentic looking, but way too long, almost 4 hours. You could easily start at the intermission and miss nothing that is really interesting. There is some character development in the first half, but it's not critical to the second half. Some of the story line was just unbelievable -- any young man in his early 20's certainly knows the difference between a boy and a girl, and the girl wasn't trying that hard to look like a boy. This movie was in black and white, as so many of the 'classic' samurai movies are. The director clearly was going for some nice scenery shots in several places, and the black and white didn't do justice to what obviously could have been some beautiful scenes. Realism is paramount in this movie though, I thought it gave an excellent depiction of life in the day."
stryker-5,"Feb 9, 1999",N/A,"The great director wrote ""Seven Samurai"" as well as presiding over the filming, and most of the 'coups de cinema' are attributable to him alone. The film is rich in cinematic master-strokes, and these notes attempt a brief survey of just a few of them.Dust blows in beautiful whorls around the village houses.  The graves of the ancestors have been capped with stones to prevent wind-erosion, and they stand as pillars of earth when all around has been stripped by the wind.  The ancestors are permanent, but all else is ephemeral.  The graves of the samurai have no capstones, and already there are plumes of dust spiralling from them.  The samurai, like the bandits, will wash over the village and recede, but the village endures for ever. At the close of the film, Shino is starting to erase Katsushiro from her consciousness as she turns enthusiastically to the rice-planting, singing the village song with gusto.  The farmers have a sense of place, a relationship with the earth. The samurai are as free, and therefore as homeless, as the windblown dust.Village houses are manmade, but are open to nature.  They are the meeting-point of earth-spirit and human artifice.  Wild streamwater babbles through each home, and the latticework walls allow the air to sift through the building's fabric.  The farmers feel almost religiously about their houses, which lie beyond the village's natural defences.Kikuchiyo, psychologically the most interesting character, is played by Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favourite actor.  A peasant by birth but a samurai by aptitude and inclination, Kikuchiyo straddles the caste division uneasily, not truly accepted in either community.  The episode of Kikuchiyo's drunkenness conveys his isolation cleverly.  The handheld camera suggests both his intoxication and, at a deeper level, his social and spiritual instability.  As he staggers about, he finds himself separated from the motionless, self-possessed samurai by the rails and slats of the room's structure.  He is the perennial outsider.What was a ghost town erupts into life, with great shots of the samurai running, and terrific crowd scenes. There is a moment of great dramatic power, in which we come to understand the suffering of Rikichi. Kikuchiyo has used his comic talent and his unique 'view from the bridge' to heal the rift of distrust between the two communities.The splendid musical score of Fumio Hayasaka marvellously augments the thematic scheme of the film.  A thousand other examples of excellence spring to mind - the unhorsed bandits, scampering like hunted rats, or the swathes of peasants with their bamboo spear stalks raised, like a bitter mockery of the harvest ...  ""Seven Samurai"" is a masterpiece, densely packed with images of astonishing power and beauty."
gbheron,"Apr 3, 2000",10/10,Let's see what this movie didn't have going for it to this middle-aged American. 1. It's in black-and-white 2. It's in Japanese 3. It takes place in a 16th century Japanese farming village 4. It's subtitled...and 5. It's 207 minutes long And it's just about the best movie I've ever seen...the time flew by.

You get to know the samurai, a few villagers and the way they bind together to defend their land. For the villagers, the samurai were just a means to rid their territory of the terrorizing bandits. The samurai wanted to return to glory, a motivation of what they once were."

Unlike movies, where you can see running ultra muscular men with their ten-grams-weight swords, there are shaking hands in this movie.There are screams, exhaustion and naive strategies. And rightful(?) slaughters, that you will watch until satisfied, in these strategies...'Shichinin no Samurai' says: People die hardly, but instantly.On the other hand, it's obvious that this meaningful movie shouldn't seem to be just an action movie. You can see all levels of Japanese society and live the period through all the movie.,"
RYPermadi,"Nov 7, 2020",10/10,The way this movie telling the story is like dragging you into medieval Japan.
steiner-sam,"Sep 7, 2023",9/10,"It's an epic historical drama set in 1586 Japan as feudalism is collapsing. It follows events in a small village that has been attacked by bandits over the years and decides to resist by hiring some uncommitted samurai to help fight back. It's epic through its 3.5-hour length.Villagers learn that the bandits plan to attack after they harvest the barley crop. They sent several men into a larger town to hire samurai who no longer have a master. First, they hire Kambei (Takashi Shimura), an experienced man with substantial leadership and tactical skills. Kambei hires five other samurai, including highly skilled zen-like Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), young untested Katsushiro (Isao Kimura), serious Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), skilled archer Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba), and witty Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki). Later, a fake samurai, Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune), joins them. He is passionate, totally undisciplined, and has an in-your-face humorous bent.Among the villagers are Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya), who is dealing with difficult memories, and protective Manzo (Keiko Tsushima), who tries to hide his daughter, Shino (Keiko Tsushima), from the samurai.""Seven Samurai"" takes its time gathering the samurai, engaging and training the villagers in setting up defenses, and experiencing a series of skirmishes and a climactic battle with the bandits. Throughout, there is humor. The personalities of the individual samurai are distinct. Villagers are much more engaged and prominent than in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" the American Western that copies the plot. This film's pace also seems more realistic than the American version. However, the bandit leader has much less profile than his counterpart in ""The Magnificent Seven,"" and one gets little sense of the bandits' motivation other than they're starving. So why not attack another undefended village rather than repeatedly attack this one?Nonetheless, ""Seven Samurai"" is a classic that has inspired countless movies and TV series like ""Mission Impossible"" that bring together a team of heroes of various skills for a particular project."

Chandru2206J,"Mar 14, 2024",6/10,"The plot of the movie was perfect for setting action sequences. However, due to the time period the movie was made, I wasn't expecting it to be as stunning as later action movies.The movie was slow and silent for most of its duration. It would have been better if they had trimmed many scenes, as the movie is 3 1/2 hours long. It's not worth watching a movie that has been stretched out for no reason.The bandits didn't feel threatening enough because they were shown in the first scene and then not again until 2 1/2 hours later which has only the scenes of recruitment of the samurais and the villagers getting trained.This movie might have been good for its intended audience and filmmakers at the time, but it's not relevant for this cinema era, or at least not for me."

TxMike,"Jan 8, 2004",N/A,"My public library system has been bolstering its collection of 'classic' movies on DVD, and viewing this one is part of my quest to see all the 'great' movies on lists like the AFI Top 100. 'Seven Samurai' is not on the AFI list, but is #1 on many lists of foreign films. So it was with great anticipation that I set aside 3.5 hours on this rainy Thursday, fighting off a sinus cold, to see it. I did, and while I consider it a very fine movie in some respects, in others I found it to be quite ordinary and slow. Maybe part of it is a cultural thing. The movie is very long in part to accommodate character development, and to tell the story in three parts -- finding the Samurai to protect the defenseless farming village, planning the defense and training villagers, then the actual battles. The 17th century Japanese samurai culture is so far removed from what interests me, I had some difficulty being attentive for 3.5 hours.  Plus, while I can enjoy some B&W movies, an epic one like this just suffers so much. Many times it was hard to tell the villagers from the samurai from the enemies, especially in dark scenes. To me 'Seven Samurai' appears to be given far too much reverence by fans of 'classic' movies.The critic Berardinelli has a very nice review of the entire movie, however I don't share his high rating of it."
annabelvangeel,"Jan 14, 2015",9/10,"There was absolutely no other reason for me to watch Seven Samurai, other than my plan of watching all movies currently in the top 250. I wasn't looking forward to it, I don't care for action movies, or Japanese movies, and the playtime of 200+ minutes.... Let's just say I put of watching this movie for a long, long time.. But then, with nothing else to do or to watch, it was time. And I won't lie to you, I have struggled through it. It was long, it was slow, it took me a while before I got what the story was about and some of the scenes didn't make sense to me. Still, I watched the full movie and I'm pretty sure I'm better for it. The best movies take effort to watch, and this one took a lot of effort. But I learned something from it, the story ended up grabbing me, not right away, but at the end. Some of the scenes were amazingly complex, at times it looked and felt like total chaos for minutes! It's a rich movie, with many stories to tell, I've never seen anything like it, that's probably one of the reasons why it was so hard to watch, but I understand now why it's in the top 250. It deserves to be! Watch it, wait for it.. and after it's gone, you will love it!"
Prince-P,"Dec 14, 2025",8/10,"There were no samurai films made in Japan before the Second World War. Although the fearsome warrior class had been a part of Japanese society for more than 1,000 years, the country was more interested in other kinds of stories. But change was in the air. When the American occupation began in 1945, new wonders were introduced to the island nation. Hamburgers, chewing gum, soda pop - and movies from Hollywood. Among them, John Ford's Westerns made a memorable impression on many people in Japan. A bright young man named Akira Kurosawa was one of them.In the summer of 1953, Kurosawa rented a secluded little cottage outside Tokyo. There, the director moved in with two scriptwriters to finish a screenplay he had just prepared. The movie concerns six samurai who help the people of a small village defend themselves against a gang of bandits. However, after a few weeks' work, Kurosawa realized that the six men were simply too boring on their own. He needed another character that was funnier, more off-the-wall. ""Seven Samurai"" was born.Despite angry protests from the management at Toho Studios, Akira Kurosawa had a costly replica of the peasant village constructed on the Izu Peninsula west of Tokyo. However, due to bad weather, production was repeatedly delayed. The final battle scene, which should have been filmed during the summer, was shot in February instead. In near-freezing temperatures. Many of the actors later complained that they had never been so cold in their entire lives.Although ""Seven Samurai"" was the most expensive production ever made in Japan, it became a huge success worldwide. Both critically and at the box office. The pictures' visuals, plot and storytelling techniques also inspired a whole line of young directors, ranging from George Lucas and Steven Spielberg to Martin Scorsese and Quentin Tarantino. In a way, Akira Kurosawa therefore became a mentor figure to a whole generation of American movie makers."

MorfenZ,"Dec 16, 2025",9/10,"These legendary movies are the parents of so many blockbusters and Hollywood classics. Seven Samurai is the origin point the blueprint. Kurosawa's masterpiece still delivers lessons to modern directors today, even though it's nearly a century old.The art is timeless. The characters are truly unique, each one unforgettable. The performances are striking - Japanese actors here feel more grounded, more human, more noticeable than most we see today. The costumes, the physicality, the emotional delivery - everything feels lived-in. And the cinematography? Absolute masterclass. Kurosawa doesn't just shoot action; he sculpts it.Watching this film for the first time, you constantly recognize where cinema learned its language. You start spotting the DNA of countless Hollywood movies and finally understand where they came from. The Magnificent Seven is the most obvious descendant, but the influence goes far beyond that.This isn't just a movie it's cinema's foundation stone."

barkingechoacrosswaves,"Feb 10, 2010",7/10,"Seven Samurai has acquired a legendary reputation among moviegoers, and is routinely called one of the top films in cinema history. I certainly appreciated Seven Samurai, but I think the praise that has been lavished on it is overdone. Apart from some creaky sentimentality and a fairly urgent need for sharper editing, there is nothing specially wrong with the movie. It is a fine blend of drama and comedy with good performances all around and an engaging story, and well shot to boot. Mifune is quite hammy in this picture, though, and that does get annoying at times.Seven Samurai is not as good as Kurosawa's own Yojimbo, which is much tighter, much more restrained in its approach to sentiment and much funnier. Perhaps most importantly, Mifune is not a character actor in Yojimbo but rather a much more ""natural"" character with an intriguing blend of dignity and earthiness, greed and generosity.If you are craving a really good samurai movie by Kurosawa and can see only one, Yojimbo is the obvious choice over Seven Samurai."

dandelion1917,"Feb 22, 2025",10/10,"The sheer scope, the energy and charisma of the actors involved, and the size of the film is astounding. If this film was made today, there'd be green screen shots one after another to capture the large scenes. But this was made in the 50's and probably didn't have easy access to it and the fact it feels so much larger than life is amazing.The story is probably one that everyone has seen a version of, but this was the original version of the small village of people getting bullied by bandits under threat of death and probably worse only for a group of warriors come to help them prepare for battle.Some of the modern franchise cliches can be traced back to this film; such as the scene transitions, the stand offs that lead to one of the combatants dying instantly, and the one character who's a little too excited about fighting. Franchises like Star Wars, Dragon Ball and even samurai animes have all taken inspiration from this. Which is to be expected because it genuinely is one of the most inspiring movies I've ever seen.This was the film that kick started my obsession with samurai and the entire history behind them. Of all the Kurosawa films, this one is the one I watch the most. If you haven't seen Seven Samurai, please don't let the runtime, the fact it's black and white or the fact it's subtitled keep you from watching it. It's peak."

Beneath its thrilling action and masterful staging lies a deeply compassionate study of honor, sacrifice, class struggle, ego, and survival, all mixed with mud, rain, swords, soul, and every defining Kurosawa trait.The film boasts extraordinary cinematography, meticulous production design, and unforgettable performances from a remarkable ensemble. Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune reach towering heights here, forging one of cinema's greatest director-actor partnerships.In its final hour, culminating in the iconic rain-soaked finale, the film achieves pure filmmaking greatness, setting a benchmark for how battles should be staged and shot. Endlessly influential-proof that great cinema doesn't age, it sharpens. More than a landmark of world cinema, Seven Samurai is a timeless meditation on the quiet tragedy of heroism."
guskeller,"Jan 21, 2022",10/10,"Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is a foundational film. Despite its age, it remains an ideal template for current blockbusters. It's rich with themes, defined characters, and meaningful action. First, the plot is a quintessential tale of heroes uniting for an honorable cause. Marvel constantly mimics this trope, but the imitators are countless. Meanwhile, characters are developed beyond warriors in battle. Viewers learn their mindsets and motivations. Each unique samurai adds to the story. Thus, Seven Samurai is ripe with ideas like unity, morality, humility, accountability, and identity. However, despite the film's intellectual density, its relatability keeps it entertaining.Next, Seven Samurai's filmmaking established every blockbuster fundamental. The music sets a daunting tone, the immersive production sells the era, the acting displays a cohesive range, and the effects are real stunts. Lastly, defined by its fluent motion, Seven Samurai has iconic cinematography and editing. Crowds, flames, and weather consistently motivate every shot and cut. Each frame is wholly utilized for meaning. Each edit expands on the action and its emotional weight. Overall, Kurosawa's vision makes Seven Samurai a concrete experience that carefully builds on itself. Therefore, Seven Samurai remains the gold standard of modern epics.Writing: 10/10

If you only think of yourself, you'll only destroy yourself.""Masterfully shot and Flawlessly executed, Seven Samurai is an absorbing experience and deeply entertaining film that asserts itself as the flagship icon of Samurai Cinema.Eloquently well written with amazing composition, Kurosawa demonstrates his commanding direction skilfully regardless how dated and aged the film is.Despite its 3 1/2 hour runtime, it was engaging from start to finish, along with well rounded and charming performances with an all-star cast including Toshiro Mifune."
delija84,"Jan 22, 2009",7/10,"OK so where do i start!...I know that this movie is praised by many as one of the greatest movies, and as far as Kurosawa's director skills,music and artistic talent this movie is brilliant...(remember this movie was filmed in 1954), but as far as acting this movie didn't quite deliver for me!...this movie is long 3 hours and 10 minutes and for at least half movie you start to notice that characters in this movie are alway running somewhere,yelling,crying and funny moving. The start of the movie is very good with nice ( creepy ) music in the background and barbarians who are approaching to the village and i also liked when people from the village go to the city to find the samurai's and then they test them!At the end this movie could be better in my book as far as acting but the great thing about this movie is crossway !"
mss-02529,"May 25, 2022",10/10,"Modern action films often lack a straightforward premise for their stories, which is one of the biggest complaints. The hero or villain must have a tragic backstory, and the final fight must involve non-stop explosions, CGI, unnecessarily large crowds, and other over-the-top elements. However, in contrast, the first eight minutes of Seven Samurai set the tone for the rest of the movie with a clear message, a simple story, and relatable characters. Through a variety of beautiful shots, great camera angles, and a breath-taking score, topped off with rich characters and impressive character development, Akira Kurosawa perfects his craft in this feature. He tells a human story that goes beyond action and fighting, using farmers, samurai, and bandits as his main characters. The influence of Seven Samurai can be seen in numerous films, such as The Magnificent Seven, Three Amigos, A Bug's Life, Star Wars, Django Unchained, and Mad Max Fury Road. Filmmakers like Martin Scorsese, Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and Quentin Tarantino have all been influenced by Kurosawa's work. If you have never seen any of Kurosawa's films, I highly recommend starting with Rashomon and Seven Samurai before exploring the rest of his filmography."
mcnimitz04,"May 11, 2010",6/10,"The movie, ""Seven Samurai"" was released in the United States on November 19, 1956. It was directed by Akira Kurosawa. The movie was originally released in Japan two years earlier. The main downside of the film is that it is 207 minutes long. Since the film is so long, there is a lot of time that is spent on scenes that do not need to happen. For example the last hour of the movie is spent on the battle sequence where they just go back and forth. There were many other example of where the movie did not have to be as long as it was. However, the acting in the film was good. The samurai warriors in the film did a good job at portraying the thoughtful leader type. They always seem to know what to do. The story is about a group of samurais that are tasked to defend a small town against attacking bandits. It culminates into a big battle for the town at the end. The film seems to echo the horrors of World war two when the United States took over Japan. It could be argued that the bandits represent the Americans while the village represents Japan. Overall this movie was very well made. However the main drawback was that it was 207 minutes long. I feel that the length of the film draws away from the storyline. By dragging out the story like that, the film covers many scenes that do not need to happen. The storyline was almost too well developed. To the point where there was almost too much information that was given to the viewer that was not needed. However the actors portrayed their parts very well. There were some samurais that seemed to always know what to do and there were some that didn't."
ferrell,"Jan 5, 2016",2/10,"Much has been said here about why would anyone bother reviewing a film they didn't like. I almost didn't. But then I thought about the emperor's new clothes. Somebody's got to cry ""Foul!""And ""Foul"" it was. Mind you, this is only my opinion. I respect your right to fall in with the majority who evidently think this film is the Cat's Pajamas. I did give it a 2 because it does have some good lines. And, after all, Shakespeare did say ""The play's the thing."" The story is a good story, though it too is not believable. We want to believe that hard-bitten professionals in any field of endeavor beneath it all have a heart of gold. And we might have too, had any of the character been believable. Not a one. I wanted to call it ""overacting"", but alas, it was just bad acting. Should I mention ""whiney-face""? Could an actual person have carried that expression around permanently?There were those who suggested that detractors didn't like the film because it was ""old"" or in ""black and white"". I watched this ponderous film last night because I thought I should. I was prepared to be enthralled. James Coburn said he watched this film 12 times in 12 days. That was enough for me. By the time the film was mercifully over, I wondered who had been holding a gun to his head for those 12 days.I like old. I like black and white. I don't like bad. I especially don't like bad that so many have told me is good. So after I watched this last night, tonight I watched Jean Simmons in ""Home Before Dark"". Made in 1958 (only 4 years newer) and also in black and white. A ways into the movie, I suddenly realized that these two films could be compared on a basic filmmaking level. Jean Simmons can actually act. In fact, all of the supporting cast can act, too. The characters were believable. Maybe not in an actual sense but at least in the sense of ""suspended disbelief"". Can't do that with Seven Samurai. Much has been said of the fine score of Seven. No. Other than tribal drums, nothing seemed to fit. Just the opposite for Home. It had a score that really fit what was going on on the screen at the time.I could go on, but my rant is assuaged and I'm too tired to write more.For those of you who have not seen the film, the following is for you: DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME. EVERYBODY ELSE IS WRONG."
erikhedman-88,"Jul 10, 2021",10/10,The acclaim is simply 100% deserved. It has so much depth and beauty that it never feels like it drags despite its considerable running time.
DocM0,"May 1, 2013",10/10,"This movie sat at home for nearly two weeks after I had received it. The age of the film, coupled with the fact that it's a daunting 3 1/2 hours made me hesitant to even watch it. But once I set my mind to it, whoa-ho I was in for a treat. I could not believe how good this movie is! At first I was watching it in the background while I did other work. However, after only 20 minutes, I was struck with the intense character development in the film. All other distractions aside, I focused on the film for the remainder of the time and sat mesmerized at the sheer quality and emotion that was captured by the director. I've watched many, many movies over the years, and I quickly lose interest in a film as I suffer through formula and predictability. Not so here. A rare treat. I'm actually going to keep this a while longer so that I can watch it again with the commentary! There truly is a reason why this is considered a gold standard. Bravo. (03.24.08 nf)"
csm-78119,"Feb 3, 2023",9/10,"It's taken me a long time to get around to watching this but I now understand the fuss. This is superbly crafted storytelling with great characterisation, intellect and humanity from legendary director Akira Kurosawa. Takashi Shimura exudes gravitas, wisdom and authority as the leader of the assembled collection of Seven Samurai who band together to protect a village of farmers from marauding bandits. Toshira Mifune looms large too as the mercurial and mischievous Kikuchio who adds much of the fun and excitement to the piece and Seiji Miyaguchi is perfect as the supreme warrior Kyuzo. This is a long film but almost every minute is well spent in creating this classic atmospheric and stirring film which was of course the inspiration for The Magnificent Seven."
rew1ele,"Oct 27, 2022",10/10,"IN ASIA NUMBER 1.About the movie
It's easy to watch the film in one breath - from the very first shot, it's obvious that it's not a westerner. If you compare the plot of the western with the film, it starts very calmly and goes into the plot like a meditation, which shows the inspiration and inner strength of the master. In order to feel and identify the psychology of his characters, Kurosawa takes a distant look, a closer look - and the viewer is gradually drawn into the vortex of events.It shows Kurosawa's talent for observation and identification - the peasants and the samurai all seem alive. Everyone has their own inner world and psychological characteristics. There is a common flaw in modern movies - the audience is forced to make their own judgments about the main characters, instead of thinking otherwise. But the story of ""7 Samurai"" is the opposite: the heroes who win with knowledge and courage are not fighters - but killers who know their job well. The peasants also have their own characteristics - and thus Akira Kurosawa shows the two lines that divide humanity: the Strong and the Poor. The difference between the two - which is good and which is bad?In the end, the wolf will not pity the sheep. A samurai would give his life for a peasant, but he would not understand his suffering - and neither would a peasant understand samurai law."
leorossi-70324,"May 12, 2020",10/10,"There probably isn't another Kurosawa film, with the exception of maybe Ikiru, that feels more humanistic. The film manages to poignantly explore the relationship between the villagers and the samurai while also maintaining a fast pace and frequently being very funny. The cinematography is also gorgeous and Kurosawa pulls out all the stops for the long battle sequences. It's really rare to see a movie that balances all its various elements as well as this one does and still come out a good cohesive whole."
imdbfan-6646544255,"Apr 4, 2025",10/10,"Kurosawa's Seven Samurai (1954) is not just a film-it's cinema at its finest. A 10/10 masterpiece that set the standard for action, storytelling, and character development. Every frame is meticulously crafted, every battle pulse-pounding, every character unforgettable.Toshiro Mifune delivers an electrifying performance as the wild, tragic Kikuchiyo, while Takashi Shimura's wise, steady Kambei anchors the film's emotional core. Kurosawa's dynamic camera work and editing make every moment feel alive, and the final battle in the rain? Legendary. More than just a samurai epic, Seven Samurai is a story of honor, sacrifice, and humanity-pure cinematic brilliance."
TarkovskyWorld,"Mar 19, 2024",N/A,"What can I say that hasn't been said before about this film? The genius of Seven Samurai lies not in how far-fetched or shocking its plot can be, but in how a story that seems simple and easy to understand can be an absolute gem when it is arranged in the ways that only Akira Kurosawa knew.Seven Samurai is an incredibly powerful film, in so many ways. His script is brilliantly written where there really isn't a flaw in 207 minutes of film. The performances of the seven samurai led by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune are spectacular, where each samurai has his own development and could interpret his own film. The organization of the samurai and their arrangement on the sets is simply magnificent, the choreography of the battles and all the costumes and art used still seem unreal to me for a film that turns 70 years old precisely this year.Akira Kurosawa transforms a 3 hour and 27 minute film into a fluid and interesting story, where we completely immerse ourselves in that world. A masterpiece."
ljelenszky,"Nov 13, 2015",10/10,"will never forget watching the extended cut at 2am in high school... such an eye opener. the scenes are perfectly crafted, and the camera work and lighting is on point. If you really like it, I advise getting the criterion edition, got it myself and truly is the best way to appreciate the film. as well, seven samurai is not only adventure/action but also a character driven narrative in which we can appreciate many subjects reacting to challenging situations. the epicness can be felt across the entire movie. the energy on the performances and the consistency within them are absolutely remarkable. This is truly a gem of cinema, in my opinion, alongside citizen kane and 2001 for the GOAT."
bob-orth,"Oct 21, 2005",7/10,"Now, I've heard that this is a great movie. However, the sheer not-goodness of the first half is very difficult to ignore. As great as the last half was, it does not justify the slow, slow, slow beginning. Maybe I'm missing something, maybe I just don't get Japanese humour, but as far as I can tell, the first half deserves a 2.Luckily for this film, there's the last half, the truly riveting conflict that seems to highlight the role of all seven samurai, as well as a few of the important peasants. While Misune's character was very... silly, the young samurai (Kambei?) adds much to the film. The last half of the movie, due to its complex conflict and character development, gets a 9.Overall a 7."
Orcun-the-cinephile,"May 25, 2025",10/10,"Seven Samurai by Akira Kurosawa is not only a classic of Japanese cinema, but it is also the foundation of contemporary action filmmaking. The film is a classic of world cinema, from its painstaking ""team assembly"" scene-possibly the forerunner of the now-familiar cliché-to its enduring impact on Westerns and ensemble-driven action stories.It's hard to ignore how Kurosawa's character-driven recruitment arc served as a catalyst for movies like The Magnificent Seven, Ocean's Eleven, and even superhero franchises like The Avengers. Every samurai is more than just a weapon and a posture; they are unique people with goals, conflicts, and identities that are rarely seen in that era's genre films. Credit should also be given to the movie for establishing human stakes in the action. Seven Samurai adds emotion and realism to its battles rather than viewing them as merely spectacle. Loss, fear, and exhaustion are all depicted in realistic detail, making it perhaps one of the first action movies to feel ""real."" Kurosawa uses psychology in addition to choreography to create tension.Nevertheless, despite its outstanding structure and impact on the genre, the movie has some shortcomings. There are times when the dramatic tone goes too far. Even though they are powerful, some scenes feel overdrawn and almost theatrical in their emotional delivery, which can occasionally disrupt the flow of the story or seem overdone by today's standards. I was briefly distracted from the otherwise engrossing experience by a few monologues and reactions, in particular, that veer into melodrama.However, the film's enormous accomplishment is barely overshadowed by these tonal inconsistencies. The epic film Seven Samurai served as a precursor to everything from spaghetti westerns to contemporary blockbusters. Because of what it inspired as well as what it is, it is a must-watch."
stephenstephenbyrne,"Nov 22, 2020",9/10,"Near perfect action movie. Tons of heart, engaging set pieces and beautifully shot. Mifune really shines here and is such a lark, he's truly one of the great physical actors"
Brantford_Mark,"Aug 29, 2020",10/10,"Considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time, it was nominated for two 1952 Oscars and won many international awards. Oscar winner Toshiro Mifune (Bridge on the River Kwai) plays a comic relief role as a devil-may-care, but suspect samurai. Sad to say I had never watched all 2 hours and 37 minutes of it before.It's essentially the very first ""men on a mission"" action flick, with 7 itinerant Samurai defending a 16th century Japanese country village against bandits. The intricate combat sequences and the tense buildup to them made the time fly by. It's fascinating to see the origins of the genre. Today, it's easy to recognize this action formula because virtually every modern screenwriter uses the same framework. Remade in the US as The Magnificent Seven, a 1960 Western with Yul Brynner, Robert Vaughn, Charles Bronson, Horst Buckholst, et al. who save a Mexican border town plagued by banditos. Highly recommended."
alibrahim1,"Aug 22, 2023",9/10,"What a great movie. Didn't feel the time even though it's very long. What a legend Kurosawa is taking story that is very very simple which can be explained in one sentence and making it into a movie that takes you into a long trip of masterful cinematography and acting. Never felt confused or bored with the well thought of dialogue.Every character has his own personality and motives. My favorite was definitely Kikuchiyo, his spirit and humor uplifted everyone. And he gave a different feel to the other strict samurai's.My dislikes are the unrealistic fighting/killing scenes also predictable story. Nothing surprising really happened but the journey of the movie is the enjoyable part. Also, would have loved a little bit more insight into the raiders point of view. We saw a little in the beginning and that's it.Very enjoyable legendary movie!"
searchanddestroy-1,"Aug 21, 2023",N/A,"Anatomy of a masterpiece, a true genuine jewel from Japan. The most known from the director Akira Kurosawa. It is long but never boring, because of the character study, the dialogues and directing skills so obvious all along this movie. It is gloomy despite the ending, nothing to do with the remake, which is however outstanding too, but from Hollywood, the tone is quite different, but not the bodycount matter. Toshiro Mifune is excellent in his role, some kind of the weirdest Samurai of the group. Actually everyone of them is so poignant, that's for me the trademark of the Japanese movies. You feel pain, grief, wrath in those films, more than in the American ones."
SkullScreamerReturns,"Apr 2, 2020",7/10,"I just hate when movies are too long. Even if it's a very good movie. It's like having your favorite food but forced to eat so much that you start to puke. How can you give a good rating for an experience like that? If you think 3 hours is a short time, see my point of view: Imagine if somebody made a movie that lasts 100 hours. Try to watch that without falling asleep. You just couldn't do it. Well, over 3 hours feels a bit like that to me. It's like adding more beverage to a cup that is already full. The rest is going to spill to the table and that's not fun anymore.The first half stayed very interesting but I started to lose my attention during the second half. It's like when you're waiting for a concert or something but the band is two hours late. When they finally come to stage you are already tired and just want to go home. The ending of this movie felt a bit like that. When the long awaited final battle was happening my thoughts weren't following the movie anymore.There are a lot of interesting characters, the story is excellent, and everything looks good visually. It's just too long, that's all.It's a pretty good film, and also so famous that you want to see it just to know what all the fuss is about. So I recommend it to everybody. But personally I don't think I'm ever going to watch it very many times again."
jmcquigg,"Nov 18, 2001",1/10,"I rented the Seven Samurai with some friends.  We found it difficult to finish this stinker, and ended up goofing on it towards the end.  Where to start?  First, the movie was SLOW - was too slow - they had segments which took 20 minutes to show that required only 3. The acting was terrible.  The directing was terrible.  The sound quality was terrible.  The story line was a good one - they just didn't do a good job of turning it into a movie."
hypathio7,"Nov 29, 2014",10/10,"I just saw a restored print of this on the big screen with newly translated subtitles. I had forgotten how long it was (with an intermission). It is more about slowly revealing the characters and saving the big action sequences for the end. I really enjoy the outdoor setting as well. I think I've mentioned it in other reviews, but there is something so beautiful about the forest. The hills surrounding the small village are magnificently captured, the wind blows, the dust is stirred up, and when it rains, the mud replaces the splatter of blood. The movie starts with a lot of slow steady drum beats for accompaniment and culminates with the rapid patter of sandaled feet and pounding hooves of the attacking bandits' horses.The story takes its time as four peasants led by Rikichi (Tsuchiya) go to town to enlist the help of samurai for the defense of their village. Samurai are born into privilege, can read and write and enjoy leisurely arts, and are generally proud of their social standing and skill. They finally find the good-hearted and intelligent Kambei (Shimura). Two other samurai are watching Kambei too. Katsushiro (Kimura) is a young man who immediately has great respect for Kambei and requests to be his disciple. Kikuchiyo (Mifune) is boisterous and intrigued by the more clever man, but expects Kambei to give him respect and acceptance automatically. The other samurai are gathered once Kambei agrees to the peasants' proposal. Toshiro Mifune is such a treat when he appears again drunk, trying to claim upper-class lineage, and wildly trying to prove some skill to the other six who only laugh. Toshiro's performance might seem over done, he's such a ham. I couldn't accept his wildly different style when I first saw this movie, but I grew to love him. Having seen him in some others pictures by now, I was totally with him during this viewing. He adds much needed humor. The story continues slowly as Kambei leads a careful defense plan to protect the four sides of the village. Meanwhile, the villagers ""piss and cry"" at every little thing and try to learn from the samurai how to use spears to defend themselves. Katsushiro has a romantic subplot with Shino, one of the peasants' daughters. Backstories are revealed about a couple of the other peasants and about where Kikuchiyo came from. Finally the bandits attack! And Kambei methodically checks off the chart on his map as they lessen the bandits' numbers. It's a very controlled, but impressive, and close battle as the villagers fight for their lives with the strategic leadership of the samurai."
Gymnopedies,"Apr 1, 2025",9/10,"""Seven Samurai"" is rightfully considered one the most influential and greatest films ever made. Akira Kurosawa's majestic and masterful powers are at full play in ""Seven Samurai"", the iconic and memorable action sequences including the legendary in the rain and mud. This scene along with many others demonstrate Kurosawa's innovative and ground-breaking approach to action sequences. Moreover, there is real jeopardy to these fights, they are not just about the fighting, but rather about the consequences of the violence. The film was set in sixteenth century Japan, a time of true upheaval and turmoil, and the local villagers are threatened by a group of malevolent bandits. The villagers hire a group of samurai to protect them, and thus the samurai defend the village and the villagers of its precious and valuable resources. The seven samurai are a diverse grouping with their own personalities and skillsets with autonomy, and this is another hallmark of such great storytelling because it could be easy to just have the samurai as a homogeneous group of warriors. It's impact on cinema is undeniable, I haven't seen many reputable and respected lists where it wasn't listed amongst the very best. I just love the dynamics at play here, the class-conflict, the struggle between the predators and the defenders. A remarkable and extraordinary film that everybody should see at least once in their lifetime."
schroederagustavo,"Jun 28, 2020",10/10,"Seven Samurai may seem daunting for people to watch for several reasons: It's old, it's really long, it's in black and white and it is in Japanese. However, this is a great movie, filled with fascinating shots, great characters, message and dialogue. Some great quotes are thrown around in here, like ""This is the nature of war. By protecting others, you save yourselves."" And I think this is the main theme of the film. What's in it for these warriors to protect the farmers? Not glory, money or women. Only rice is offered to them and a roof above their head. It's a noble cause to help these poor people and Kurosawa makes a brilliant statement in his way of letting the viewer know the suffering and the desperation of these people. All of the samurai have interesting personalities and of course, the standout being Kikuchiyo, the loud-mouth, eccentric, often show-off character, who is only trying to win the approval of the samurai. And he is a hero and a great character. It is a great film, indeed."
OnoOdog,"Jul 27, 2024",8/10,"This movie has been redone, remade, referenced, and homaged so many times across every story medium that I felt intimately familiar with it before I ever saw it. I'm still fairly partial to that one Clone Wars episode ""Bounty Hunters"" as well as the book 'Young Samurai: The Ring of Fire' but this original variant by the revolutionary Akira Kurosawa is rather grand. The cast is quite large and slightly ungainly but the actors do a rather good job, with the leads of Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune holding down the fort both as actors and literally as the characters. Mifune especially gives an unhinged performance with random ticks and noises that make him an obnoxiously humorous character, but he has a couple moments in which he's allowed to ground it emotionally and he does well in those too. The movie takes a little bit to lift off the ground and then grows slightly repetitive near the end with the multiple bandit attacks, but things flow well enough for the most part. As a lover of action films, the actual battles are definitely a little 50s for my modern tastes, with some somewhat cheesy combat, but it all manages to feel serious and weighty that I can forgive it. An interesting, influential, emotional, and well crafted work of art."
aangaril,"Jan 20, 2015",9/10,"Best Kurosawa film to my humble opinion and one of the best plays from Mifune. Everything matches all together: story, choreography, photography, dialogs, acting...there's nothing left. Most important is the rhythm of the film. Although being part of Japan arts & cinema school Toho, he imposes a tense and continuous thread all over. It is clear all the scripts from Kurosawa, come from a wide conception, deep interpretation of diverse classics from worldwide literature. There is quite non left. In this film you can feel from the ancient Greek tragedy drama to the more contemporaneous English black novel. Essential film to watch to understand cinematography history."
Sir-Final_Thoughts-No_Review,"Oct 6, 2022",10/10,"There's so much that can be dissected in this movie. An epic in terms of length, scope, ambition, and moviemaking quality all in one. Movies like this are what we go to the movies for. An Akira Kurosawa offering that has been replicated, studied, revered and seen millions of times over and will continue to be for ages to come. Its not only endlessly entertaining but it teaches, there are alot of lessons to be learned here. But with the good comes the bad, it also depicts the horrors of war, the struggle to survive and many many more. The bad doesn't underscore this movie by any means, it just makes it that much more relatable to the viewer.Seven Samurai is the exact highlight of the film, seven colorful warriors each with their own unique personalities highlighted by the ever wonderful, scene stealing Toshiro Mifune the misfit of the 7 and Takashi Shimura in a key, key role. The highlight also on the villagers that depend on these seven samurai to defend their village from bandits. We get to learn many things about them throughout the movie in various sub plots. But its very serpentine in its approach to everything, it doesn't dawdle on a scene for too long and each one is pivotal to set up what's to come. Its carefully made and very well written and directed by the master himself. A story becoming almost like a fairy tail.The morals that are presented are plenty and impactful as well and contain everything from honor and dishonor, distrust in strangers, working together to accomplish goals, the conflict of man vs. Man, the importance of food, and respect to name only a few. You really come out of this having learned something.Also the music is awesome in this movie. The main title opening and the ending are highlights. Everything about this film is fantastic. Its got some good laughs in there too. Long but enjoyable right until the end. A timeless classic!"
charlesmckay-99542,"Jul 31, 2023",7/10,"DONT HATE ME PLEASE!This film is good, just not gold like everyone claims it is. I enjoyed many parts of this film, but was altogether lulled nearly to sleep during other parts. This really could just be a two hour film without seeming strained, but there are many repetitive shots and altogether pointless scenes which establish character for people who aren't even focused on until their death.If you want to learn to like Kurosawa watch this film when you are a veteran to his craft. Watch Hidden Fortress instead as it is much more fast paced, humorous, and entertaining.If you're thinking of watching this film for its influence on Star Wars, realize that unless you are planning on intricately analyzing scenes and cinematography, you should just watch Hidden Fortress. Hidden Fortress is clearly the test key which George Lucas respectfully cheated from and switched a few answers when writing the script for Star Wars. This film really is just Star Wars without Luke, Han and Chewbacca, or a Death Star. Which is big enough of a difference to be entertaining.If you are watching this because of Magnificent Seven, rest assured, you've already watched it. Magnificent is literally just a locational change and nothing else is substantially different.I like this film, but I have enjoyed every other Kurosawa much better."
debrief4892,"Oct 31, 2024",8/10,"I rated Seven Samurai an 8/10, and it certainly deserves its reputation as a cinematic masterpiece. Directed by Akira Kurosawa, this 1954 classic tells a story of resilience, bravery, and selflessness that feels just as powerful today. The film is visually stunning, with Kurosawa's unique style bringing energy and depth to every scene. Each character is thoughtfully developed, especially the seven warriors, whose distinct personalities and motivations create a compelling dynamic.While the film is lengthy, every moment is rich with meaning and tension, making it an immersive experience. Kurosawa's ability to craft such detailed and memorable characters, alongside beautifully choreographed action sequences, sets Seven Samurai apart as a landmark in storytelling. A must-see for any fan of classic cinema!"
turkeytom33,"Jan 3, 2025",7/10,"I watched Seven Samurai for the first time a few days ago.I had watched other Kurosawa movies in the past - Rashomon...a masterpiece; RAN...great but too long; The Hidden Fortress....good.There is a 2 and a half hour version out there of this movie, so maybe that would be the better version, but I still think that would be too long for the story that is being told.I know some of the subtle references in Seven Samurai are probably lost on me (being a Westerner).I do get the class references in the movie. The stoic Samurai (well, 5 of the 7, but the two exceptions are explained in the movie) against the ""heart on the sleeve"", emotional, farmers. But the over acting of some of the farmer characters is a sledge hammer to get that message across. Even Mifune is over the top, but I get why, as is revealed.I thought the ending was powerful, the futility of it all."
suryakantgautam-26088,"Apr 7, 2022",4/10,"As a movie made in 1954, its outstanding piece of art but now the world has seen enough battles and wars. It seems like fine movie. Very obvious story with too much stretched story. Its good but not a must watch film."
artibiz,"Mar 25, 2023",9/10,"I watched Magnificent 7 which is a classic cult movie. Over the years have seen it dozen of times. Then couple of years later came to know that M7 is inspired by this classic movie which is a work of art by Akira Kurosawa. The story line is that of sacrifice and bravery during the time of feudal Japan.One striking aspect of ""Seven Samurai"" is its cinematography. Shot in black and white, this effect adds a sense of timelessness and austerity to the story. Kurosawa used variety of camera angles and techniques to create a sense of tension and suspense throughout the film.Another aspect that I liked in the movie is its complex and multifaceted characters. All the 7 Samurais have their own a distinct personality and backstory, which adds depth and complexity to their characters. Some are motivated by honor and duty, while others are cynical and opportunistic. The poor farmers of the village are also portrayed with their own fears and desires that drive their actions."
monsterhunt-94296,"Oct 13, 2020",9/10,"Alright so today I watched Seven Samurai, probably Kurosawa's most well-known film, and for good reason. If you're thinking about watching this movie, it can be daunting for modern audiences. First off, it's 3 hours and 27 minutes long, secondly it's black and white, and thirdly it has subtitles. This film was not disappointing. It was actually very entertaining, and although there were point where you did feel the run time, for the majority of the film I was thoroughly entertained. There's comedy, there's drama, there's action, this movie has everything you look for in a film. The framing is incredible, the way Kurosawa constantly has something new entering the frame or something exiting the frame is great, the depth showing the size of this world is great, and overall the cinematography just immerses you in the film. All of the characters are done so well, every conversation has so much entertainment value, the characters just bounce off each other so nicely. The acting here is also amazing, I don't think there was a point in the film where I remembered that these are just actors. The story here is honestly pretty simple, but it has a lot of impactful moments and leaves you really satisfied by the end.
Let me talk about the action in this movie for a second, because despite the fact this is a 1954 film, it has some of the best and most intense action I've ever seen. This is due to the fact there's not just explosions everywhere like a modern film would throw at you, but the action dives deep into the strategy behind the battle as each and every enemy killed has huge significance. One thing that I really liked about this movie was how much time was dedicated to character moments and set-up. A modern studio would shred the run time by an hour and shove in more action scenes. This movie doesn't have that much action for the first 2 hours, but all of it is important and all of it is entertaining. The score here is also really good, and I thought it added some nice personality to the film. I honestly just had a really great time watching this movie. I can't think of anything else to say at the moment, so I'll leave it at that. 9/10."
I_Ailurophile,"Apr 4, 2024",10/10,"Long films can be daunting no matter their reputation, but thankfully Kurosawa Akira makes the viewing experience smooth and easy. It's one matter to read of the influence that this has had on innumerable features to follow in subsequent decades, but to sit and watch there's no disputing how heavily the modern action flick is indebted to 'Seven samurai.' It's not just about this being the source of tropes and narrative ideas, however, for frankly I don't think there's any question that Kurosawa makes use of them all in ways far better than what successive works have. The titular warriors are the primary characters, but the writing does not focus on them so overwhelmingly as to strip them of all mystery; the supporting characters, the villagers, are written with far more personality and depth than the likes of DC or Marvel comic book movies, any Tom Cruise vehicle, or the 'Fast and the furious' bonanzas could ever pretend to claim. And all these figures are written so well, it should be said - a tremendous credit to Kurosawa, Hashimoto Shinobu, and Oguni Hideo - that while this is and should be known as an action title, even as the violence is predominantly reserved for the second half, the whole is so marvelously absorbing and compelling that we're fully locked in and invested well before the bandits make their run at the village.It truly cannot be overstated what an outstanding treasure 'Seven samurai' is, a classic so great that one is made to wonder if the very term ""classic"" isn't desperately overused as it is applied to anything that isn't this. The story is terrifically engrossing every step of the way, from early illustration of the farmers' plight and their search for help, to the gradual assembly of the septet; from the planning and preparation of the village, to simply the interactions of the samurai and the community, to at last the fierce conflict between the villagers, with their protectors, and the bandits. All throughout there are touches of humor to join the violence, and Hayasaka Fumio's original score is so magnificently rich and varied that it readily commands our attention just as completely as anything else - and when all is said and done, the drama herein is so impactful at every point, through to the very end, that it's hard to drum up many comparisons across the medium. At every turn Kurosawa captures the mood perfectly, orchestrating shots and scenes with calculation and finesse that nevertheless feels totally natural, and even if one had no other frame of reference there could be little doubt as to why the man has been remarked time and again as one of the world's best filmmakers.This isn't just about Kurosawa, however, nor his co-writers. The cast is exemplary, and it hardly seems fair to highlight just one or two. Shimura Takashi is warm and congenial as the samurai leader Kambei, a welcome anchor for the proceedings; in stark contrast, legendary Mifune Toshiro brings such fiery vitality to the tale as mercurial Kikuchiyo that he almost threatens to outshine all other factors. This is to say nothing of Miyaguchi Seiji as stoic but powerful Kyuzo, Kimura Isao as youthful, ambitious Shiro, or those portraying the diverse villagers, like Tsuchiya Yoshio, Hidari Bokuzen, Fujiwara Katamari, Tsushima Keiko, or anyone else. The life these actors breathe into their parts is as integral to the success and legacy of the picture as the gorgeous filming locations, the detailed sets, Nakai Asakazu's beautiful cinematography, the superb stunts, effects, and action sequences, the sharp props and weapons, the fetching costume design, hair, and makeup, or indeed Kurosawa's shrewd, eye-catching editing. Really, this is so fantastic in every capacity that one is forced to wonder if this isn't a relatively rare example of a genuinely perfect, flawless film. Is there any possible criticism to make?The fundamental imagery to greet our eyes is nothing less than wonderful, making the entirety all the easier to soak in throughout these 200-odd minutes. There's no two ways about it: 'Seven samurai' is stellar, a masterpiece with precious few peers in all the years of cinema, and everyone owes it to themselves to watch it at least once. For my part it's been upwards of twenty years since I saw it last, and I've been long overdue to revisit it; now that I have, I'm kind of aghast that it's taken me so long, and I feel as if I've undervalued it heretofore. Don't delay; make the time for it - there are some pieces so exceptional that personal preferences go right out the window, and this demands the viewership of one and all."

Each character is fleshed out and we can see their interactions with other characters. The themes and characters are beautiful. The cinematography is used masterfully. I believe analyzing this movie by writing notes down somehow made my experience much better. I got to understand the characters and every scene had significance.

solejinny,"Oct 6, 2024",N/A,"Seven Samurai"" is a timeless masterpiece that brilliantly showcases Akira Kurosawa's directorial genius. The film masterfully blends action, drama, and character development, making it a captivating experience from start to finish. Each of the seven warriors is distinct and well-developed, allowing viewers to connect with their struggles and motivations. The cinematography is stunning, with iconic visuals that enhance the storytelling. The themes of honor, sacrifice, and camaraderie resonate deeply, making it more than just an action film. The pacing keeps you engaged throughout its runtime, and the emotional depth elevates it to a true classic. A must-watch for any cinema lover!"
ViswanathI,"Nov 9, 2015",10/10,"Kurosawa was considered the most Western of great Japanese directors (too Western, some of his Japanese critics sniffed). ""Seven Samurai"" represents a great divide in his work; most of his earlier films, Jeck observes, subscribe to the Japanese virtues of teamwork, fitting in, going along, conforming. All his later films are about misfits, nonconformists and rebels. The turning point can be seen in his greatest film, ""Ikiru"" (1952), in which a bureaucrat spends his days in the rote performance of meaningless duties but decides when he is dying to break loose and achieve at least one meaningful thing.There is also an instinctive feeling for composition. Kurosawa constantly uses deep focus to follow simultaneous actions in the foreground, middle and background. Often he delineates the distance with barriers. Consider a shot where the samurai, in the foreground, peer out through the slats of a building and across an empty ground to the sight of the bandits, peering in through the slats of a barrier erected against them. Kurosawa's moving camera often avoids cuts in order to make comparisons, as when he will begin on dialogue in a closeup, sweep through a room or a clearing, and end on a closeup of another character who is the point of the dialogue."
aj-to,"Nov 13, 2005",7/10,"I really don't get why this film rates that high in the top 250. Based on other reviews, my expectations on seeing Seven Samurai were high. But I only found myself wondering why this should be the 'film of films'. On the contrary, I found it quite mediocre and was bored. People say, on appreciating it you should realize it's an old movie and that by means of the cinematic it was very revolutionary in its days. But why then is there a total lack of that approach with respect to other old movies? Why should I suddenly be so scrupulous on seeing The Seven Samurai? Because of its icon status? Well, I don't agree. Sure, I enjoyed the film, for me it had its good moments, but not more than an average other movie. In fact, most of the time I felt embarrassed to my wife, looking the film with me and to whom I had recommended it because of the lyric reviews. I expected something quite different. To me, it was boring, slow, often strange and, like I said, certainly not better than many other films I know. I'm puzzled why this film ranks so high in the top 250, immediately after Schindler's List. Probably I'm so blunt that all the greatness spotted by other people escapes to me."
Peach-2,"Feb 21, 1999",10/10,"This is simply one of the most perfect films I have ever sat down to watch. This is an epic of great scale and the cinematography is awesome. The acting is dead on and even the portrayl of the peasant villagers is graphic and perfect. Akira Kurosawa is simply one of the greatest directors and autuer film-makers that has ever lived. Kurosawa's film's hit you on a level you wouldn't expect and they take you for a ride that is unforgettable. This film has great atmosphere and you get to see the absolutely astounding Toshiro Mifune, simply the greatest Japanese actor of all time. Do yourself a favor and take a rainy afternoon and sit down to watch one of the most important films in cinema history."
KHydak,"Feb 1, 2000",10/10,"I admit I am one of the younger generation that needs an I.V. of caffeine to avoid falling asleep when watching a black and white ""classic"" like Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind.I find the acting and general direction of those films boring and uninteresting.Seven Samurai was a different story.It has nothing to do with it being about samurai, this movie doesn't even have much violence till the very end of its 3½+ hours. Even the subtitles, which I am sure lost much in the translation, didn't bother me at all.This movie lacks absolutely nothing. To sum up everything I love about it would take many paragraphs.Next time someone tells you Pulp Fiction or Star Wars is the ""Best Movie Ever"", sit them down in front of Seven Samurai.I only wish I was fluent in Japanese so I could experience this the way it was intended."
MrVibrating,"Jul 28, 2006",10/10,"This movie has been seen and loved by movie fans since it was made. It's so classic it's hard to imagine a movie world without it. It's one of few ""foreign"" movies to be in the top 250 of IMDb, and if that's any measure of anything it's at least popularity. So what can I say that hasn't been said before? Not much I'm afraid.Still, I enjoyed Seven Samurai very much and I'd like to share why. It's one of the first action movies, and it set up ground rules followed by movies to this day. It's a rich story, at the time original, and it's got a magnificent cast of characters, each sympathetic and with their own depth. It's beautifully shot, with camera-work which is also copied to this day.The actors are great and really make the most of their well-written roles. Takashi Shimura plays a noble samurai who leads his group of fellow samurais to defend a small village. He's a good man, he's down to earth and caring. Strangely enough, he looks exactly like Morgan Freeman in this movie. No doubt because Mr. Freeman has learned quite a lot of his acting from this character and from Takashi's immense skills as an actor.The other six samurais are equally well portrayed, with the crazy and honour-seeking Kikuchiyo and the young and enthusiastic Katsushiro(who is ever-present in this kind of movie today) standing out as the two most memorable characters.The setting, old Japan, is well-made and feels very real. The clash between old and new is also present, for example how the bandits bring three guns, and how they use them cowardly and unfairly.At very few points in Seven Samurai are you aware you're watching a movie. The acting, camera-work and the super-tight script lure you in, and by the time of the final battle, you care about the characters more than they care about themselves.Recommended to anyone with a remote interest in movie history or just good movies in general. If you feel it's slow in the beginning, hang on! It's worth it."
Spleen,"Jul 18, 2001",10/10,"Some films are so good that their length becomes a virtue in itself - you're grateful for every minute, every hour, that they last.  Such films usually seem longer than they are.  In fact, all the very best films seem longer than they are.Kurosawa's story doesn't just progress, it grows.  It starts as the story of two farmers attempting to persuade just one samurai to help them; when this one samurai is found, it turns into the story of the farmers and the samurai recruiting other samurai; when everyone is recruited, it turns into the story of how the samurai defend the farmers' village.  Each of these three stories, while it lasts, feels like the REAL story.  But the subsequent story is always longer, more complex and more fulfilling.  This is much harder to pull off than it sounds.Of all Kurosawa films this one probably has the most prints in circulation, so there's no excuse for not seeing it on a big screen."
Keyser Soze-12,"Dec 23, 2000",N/A,"Everyone in film has heard of Seven Samuri.  If you've never heard of it, you are pretty new to film.  You can't go to any movie site on the net that doesn't mention it.   But, not everyone has seen it.This movie continues to amaze me to this day.  If you haven't seen this movie, pick it up.First off, if you don't like foreign films, I can understand that.  I don't either. It's not that I'm racist to other countries, it's just that foreign films are usually artistic.  And I hate artistic movies.  But Seven Samuri is not artsy.  Once you get past the subtitles, the film is great.  I don't like subtitles.  They're distracting.  Now dubbing is bad too.  It takes away from the actors performances (not to mention it's funny as hell in a Godzilla sort of way).  But I perfer dubbing mainly because it doesn't require you to take your eyes away from the action.  So, if you can get this movie in dubb, please do.Everything about this movie is ahead of its time.  My favorite character is Kitshirio (or however his name is spelled). He's much like the comic relief we see in movies every day, only this guy is good and important to the story.I really don't want to talk about this movie anymore.  It's so good, please see it.  If you don't see it, you have no right to call yourself a film fan. This is THE most important movie of all time, because every movie that Hollywood has ever made has copied or taken something from this film.  See it.  Please.9/10(It would deserve a 10, but it is a wee bit overrated.)"
gga,"Apr 5, 2000",7/10,"...his other work (Ikiru, Rashomon, etc), still this movie is loved by audiences since it is one of Kurosawa's films with a traditional Hollywood script.  Inspired by American westerns, it is only fitting that the film was later adapted several times to that setting. There's little depth in this movie, compared to Kurosawa's other pieces.  It is just pure entertainment, dealing briefly with issues such as honor, mismatched lovers and solidarity. The movie feels a little long nowadays, and it does take some time to get started.  But this setup pays off later on. Battle plans are explained before hand so the public can follow the action sequences in the same way a general can.  And once the battle begins, you won't be able to stop watching. Mifune steals the best, funniest and of the most memorable scenes in the movie, as an infiltrated soldier in enemy lines. The action is dramatic and the stunts are outstanding.  With hundreds of extras, great b&w photography and an impressive production, the movie takes on epic qualities that have little to envy to any Hollywood production."
Eddie C.,"Jan 6, 1999",10/10,"Many film critics cite ""Citizen Kane"" as the best film ever made. Although ""Kane"" is a very good choice, an astute film student can learn just as much about the art of cinema from watching ""Seven Samurai"" and enjoy a much more exciting movie.I have seen this film many times on videotape and laserdisc. (God willing, I hope to get the DVD later this month.) While there are many things to praise about this film, I am expecially impressed with Kurosawa's attention to character. How many times in American blockbusters do we see cardboard characters that seem less like real people than stereotypes? In this film, not only are each of the samurai distinct individuals, but the farmers are also real people too. They aren't just victims that need to be rescued--they take an active role in the defense of their village, and once battle-trained, are just as brave and heroic as the samurai. Because Kurosawa gives us the time to get to know the characters, each death affects us all the more.A final word about the actor Toshiro Mifune. When he died in 1997, many commentators called him the ""John Wayne"" of Japan. Mifune would have been honored, but he was more gifted and versatile than Wayne ever was. In this film, his character first seems like a buffoon--you almost wonder if ""Kikuchiyo"" is supposed to be a comic relief for the other ""real"" samurai. But as the action get more serious, ""Kikuchiyo"" changes and ones appreciation for Mifune grows. There is a speech Mifune makes about the nature of farmers and samurai that is so moving, it should have won him an Academy award if this had been an English language film. As it stands, the loss belongs to the Academy, not to Toshiro."
ShinjiIkari,"Dec 21, 2003",7/10,"Over-acting, exagerated expressions, long story... but there are some good points too, such as character development, and feeling-inducing scenes that brings the viewer into the movie, oblivious to the room's surroundings. The idea of poorness is really well illustrated..."
bunot,"Jun 10, 1999",10/10,"A remarkable cinematic masterpiece. A story that is timeless and classic. Characters that grasp your attention. Akira Kurosawa is truly the greatest director in the history of film-making. His style and manner has influenced directors like Scorcese, George Lucas and Spielberg. The right blend of humor and compassion that the film expresses is something other films try to strive for, but fall short when compared to this movie.(Notice too, if you've seen the Phantom Menace....George Lucas uses the ""sliding cut"" scene, something that Kurosawa started and can be seen in the 7 Samurai.)Some scenes that exemplify Kurosawa's creativity in this movie:scene where Manzo finds out Shino slept with Katsushiro and it starts to rain. Kurosawa focuses on the campfire and you see the fire slowly fizzle and start to die as the rain start to pour down heavily.scene where Kyuzo kills the stubborn samurai in a duel. after Kyuzo cuts him, Kurosawa films in slow motion and you can see the other samurai fall slowly to the ground and the dust around him billow slowly.I don't understand why people are complaining about the length...I for one, didn't want the movie to end."
Steffi_P,"Mar 25, 2007",10/10,"This is Kurosawa's best known and most beloved film, and rightly so.Seven Samurai has been called the first modern action movie. That's a matter perhaps more of definitions than anything else, but whatever the case this is certainly a film in which literally physical action is important. Kurosawa's use of movement, always an important element in his pictures, is here brought to perfection. Actors pop in and out of the frame, dynamic edits are used for emphasis, and scenes often begin with a burst of action. For Kurosawa this type of construction is not just about creating an exhilarating action picture; the movement is also symbolic of life, vitality and irrepressibility and this is central to the picture.Kurosawa constantly dealt with the conflict between an individual's true value and the constraints of their social status. One of his greatest achievements is revealing the humanity in the most unassuming of people. In Ikiru (1952) Kurosawa had done this as a single character study, turning a middle-aged fuddy-duddy into a hero, but Seven Samurai is an even fuller statement of the notion. First off we have peasants who refuse to accept nasty, brutish and short lives. Then we have the Samurai. Jobless ronin, already considered the scum of feudal Japan, who accept the ultimate humiliation in being employed by peasants rather than a lord. Both peasants and Samurai are changed by their experiences, and shown to be greater people for it. And at the centre of this humanist theme is Kikuchiyo  a man of peasant stock who pretends to be a Samurai. Nothing can change the lowlyness of his birth, but he becomes one of the seven by the way he acts.It's also worth remembering that Kurosawa was a maverick in Japanese cinema, and if he was pointing the finger of one hand at social ills, he was generally pointing the finger of the other hand at his contemporaries in the industry. Just as Seven Samurai tears into Japanese conventions of hierarchy and duty, it also attacks the romanticised, portrayal of feudal loyalty and honour that ran through the Samurai genre. By the way, some knowledge of Japanese culture is helpful in understanding the significance of all this, particularly the status of the jobless Samurai, but it is not a necessity to enjoy the film.In the way that his goal is to humanise his characters, Kurosawa is much like his idol John Ford, and Seven Samurai in fact shares a lot of ground with Ford's Stagecoach. What really strikes me about Seven Samurai however is the depth of characterisation. It is typical in Japanese cinema for there to be around ten central characters, as opposed to three or four in the average western film. But these characters are not simply pieces in a jigsaw puzzle  each has their own issues and their own journey to go on. Kurosawa takes his time in introducing the Samurai characters, with each getting their own very memorable first scene. The four or five peasant characters that we get to know are no less well-rounded and complex, but the way they are presented to us is very different. They instead gradually emerge from the mass of identical looking farmers. By the end we have as much respect for Rikichi and Yohei as we do for Kambei and Kyuzo.There really is no single weak link in Seven Samurai. There is another great musical score Fumio Hayasaka, which manages to capture the diversity of tones in Kurosawa's narrative. The acting performances are all good, and the casting is spot on. Toshiro Mifune really gets to show off the breadth of his range. At times he is snarling beast like in Rashomon, but he later displays a deep humanity, ranting emphatically, making children laugh and breaking down in tears on more than one occasion. It's clear though that it was Kurosawa who really brought out the best in Mifune if you compare this to his performances in, for example, Hiroshi Inagaki's Samurai Trilogy (made around the same time), which are merely adequate.I'd also like to briefly mention my favourite scene. It's the one where the peasants who live outside the village try to split from the program because their houses will be lost, and the Samurai stop them. It's the very heart of the film for me. Firstly, it explains the importance of working together. It also shows for the first time how the peasants have changed in comparison to those opening scenes. They have gone from a frightened rabble to being confident and organised. The final seconds of this scene are absolutely incredible in their framing and timing  we see the peasants standing proudly in line, the music swells up, Kikuchiyo straightens out the one crooked spear, the music reaches a climax, a gust of wind blows across the scene and fade out. Brilliant.Seven Samurai is a classic because it is one of the fullest, roundest and deepest films ever made. It is one of the few films that scores on every level  excitement, emotion, storytelling and sheer technical quality. It's a great achievement in itself to produce a three-hour plus film that is endlessly watchable and never dull. It represents the first peak in Kurosawa's career, and a high point for cinema as a whole."
LoneWolf6,"Mar 13, 2003",10/10,"The scene where two bandits are fleeing and are shot by their own, they are hit a split second before the gunshot sound is heard - this is not a mistake. Do you really think Kurosawa would miss that?  That scene is done on purpose.  So if you see a version where the hit and gunshot are at the same time, its altered. Kurosawa was to much of a perfectionist, please change your claim inthe""goofs"" section it's an insult!"
FilmOtaku,"Sep 27, 2004",9/10,"Akira Kurosawa's film 'Seven Samurai' is another one of those films that most people recognize as one of the greatest ever, without ever even seeing the film first; just solely based on its reputation. Admittedly, I was one of those people, so I was delighted to find that, when finally seeing this film, I finally have the experience to back up my opinion.'Seven Samurai', written and directed by Kurosawa, tells the tale of a small village in Japan in the 1600's that is plagued by bandits who take their food supply, not leaving enough for the villagers to survive on. When they discover that the bandits will strike again after their rice crop is harvested, they decide to take the few possessions they own and employ samurai to defend the village. Seven samurai are eventually recruited, and they help the villagers learn to defend themselves, while dealing with clashing values, traditions and perceptions.My synopsis of the plot does not begin to do justice to this incredible story. Kurosawa spins a rich and intertwining tale that is at times dramatic, and at others, hilariously funny. While I have no idea who 90% of the actors are, Kurosawa's 'muse', I was thrilled to see Toshiro Mifune playing a samurai who is a loose cannon and all around nutcase. Having seen Mifune in only serious roles, most notably in Kurosawa's 'High and Low' it was a very entertaining surprise. In terms of the film itself, Kurosawa's direction is nearly flawless. Despite its three and a half hour run time, the pacing was perfect and there were no points where the film lagged. While the film is about samurai, and the perception of the general public in recent decades may have changed since the 1950's, 'Seven Samurai' is mostly story and not a lot of hard action (of course, look at the decade we're also dealing with), although there was one really slick fight scene when Kurosawa filmed a shot in slow motion that made me howl.There is really no comparing the remake of this film, 'The Magnificent Seven' because while the story is similar, just about everything else is different. However, after watching 'The Magnificent Seven', then 'Seven Samurai' (both for the first time, on the same night) I was struck by how much more emotional I was during several scenes in 'Seven Samurai' than their equivalent scenes in the former film. Both in terms of dramatic acting and dialogue, and the respectful and beautiful framing of shots by Kurosawa, 'Seven Samurai' packed a much bigger emotional wallop for me.Every time I watch a film off of the IMDb 250 or the AFI 100, I take an admittedly ridiculous amount of time to examine its merit in its place on the list, or whether it deserves to be on the list at all. Obviously, the films closest to #1 get the most scrutiny, and 'Seven Samurai' was the only film in top 20 that I hadn't yet seen. While I don't agree with several of the films in the top 10 being placed ahead of my personal favorite film, 'Citizen Kane', after seeing 'Seven Samurai' I believe it should solidly be placed exactly where it is. It is a groundbreaking film that stands up fifty years later. Whether or not you have seen the film, try to catch it on the Criterion DVD  I have seen clips of the film before, and unfortunately the prints were damaged and scratched. The Criterion transfer is absolutely gorgeous, so seek it out.--Shelly"

Where an American film would have some kind of dialog, ""Seven Samurai"" had a group of people just sitting or standing around, staring straight ahead for a long-ish stretch of time.  I'm not sure if it was directorial thing--some scenes did suggest that--or if it was a Japanese thing.  These scenes of silent staring got tiresome by the second cassette. The story concerns some villagers who hire seven samurai to defend them against some raiders.  ""The Magnificent Seven"" is the same story, only much more tightly edited.  ""The Seven Samurai"" has a more poignant ending, though.  It was interesting to watch the ""crazy samurai"" up until the actual battle scenes, then he was relegated to the background as an extra element of frenzy.  He seemed bi-polar, sometimes he was lucid, and other times, a true nut case.  How he actually joined up is classic fun.  I view this film as worth seeing at least once, but not as a ""great"" film."
johnnyh-50202,"Jan 5, 2025",7/10,"How do you even rate a film like this in 2025. I understand its influence on later movies, but as a film by it self, Im not sure.The plot is really simple, and character development is almost non existent. At the same time it has a run time of 3,5 hours, which seems highly unnecessary, for such a simple film.Acting is also rather problematic. Its either bland or completly over the top overacting, bordering child like behavior, which makes their actions seem unrelatable (to me).It does have vey nice cinematography, for its time, and the music seems fitting, but it all does seem rather dated.So whats the conclusion, to me its a movie, that does have an interesting story and is nicely filmed, and where I can see its infiuence, but its also a movie that has not aged very well."
gonzofilms,"Feb 12, 2006",9/10,"I must admit that when I realized I had to sit through 3 and 1/2 hours of subtitles, I was a bit taken aback. Nevertheless, the investment was well worth the time. The story, so involving, the characters, so well defined, and the emotions and energy, so refreshing, that the movie flows gracefully. You forget that you are reading subtitles, you forget the the movie is 50 years old. You forget that it is in black and white. Subtly, but assuredly, the viewer has become a villager, nervous and anxious for what comes next.I don't know if this movie is my 5th favorite of all time (where this movie ranked at the time of my review), however it is extremely powerful, unique, moving and memorable of movies that rarely cross the fine line between excellence, and unbelieavable.I heartily recommend this movie. Make a lot of popcorn."
ksf-2,"Jun 22, 2020",7/10,"After all his awesome (but LONG) films... Director Kurosawa was finally nominated in 1986, and given an honorary oscar in 1990. i'm surprised that he hadn't won for any of his earlier works, which were large, full, epics. Hidden Fortress. ""Ran"" was nominated for a couple, and won for best costume. Back to Seven Samurai, in 1954. Stars Toshiro Mifune, of course; they would make 25 films together! Kikuchiyo (Mifune) rounds up six other ronin to help defend the town against the coming invasion; the invaders are waiting until the crops are harvested, and will swoop in for the easy payoff. Kikuchiyo isn't really a samurai, but needs the meals that come with the work. famine. rain. misery. Takashi Shimura is Kambei Shimada, who turns out to be the real leader of the defenders. like most Kurosawa films, it's very big, and dramatic. and so many scenes just go on SO long. i guess because he was such a force in japan, no-one had the authority to tell him to make cuts. most of his films are great, also but SO long. Good story. very well done, if you have the patience to sit through it."
tim777ca,"May 1, 2002",2/10,"Seven Samurai, hired by the farmers in a village to protect them, set up a plan to fight a bunch of bandits. Each time the bandits attack, they open the village gate to let a few men in, then close the gate and kill them. So the bandits just keep on charging into the trap everyday and finally lose the battle. Are the bandits idiots? Who would believe this? There's absolutely no depiction on the bandits' side, which makes The Magnificent Seven a better film to watch."
Jaewoo,"Jan 21, 2004",N/A,"This movie is routinely rated as one of the top 10 movies of all time. Now that is a tall order so I decided to rent it, and I don't remember the last time I was more disappointed with a movie.The movie is around 3hours long. The storyline is highly predictable and the characters are cliche.  The action sequence are the lamest of any movie you will ever see. I think I have seen 10 year olds fight more fiercely than the characters of the film.The photography is choppy and the storytelling is very deliberate. Considering the plot is extremely simple, it is agonizing to watch the plot unfold into its most obvious conclusion.The conclusion of the movie, you guessed it, is that the 7 Samuraris saves the day by defeating bunch of bandits. As far as characters, there is the tough guy, intellectual guy, leader guy, rich guy, drunk guy, skilled fighter guy, and the coward guy. They are the Samurai equivalent of the Seven Dwarfs or N'Sync.Magnificent Seven, which is the western copy of this movie, is way better, and that film is no where near a top 10 movie."
vitaleralphlouis,"Jul 31, 2005",10/10,"First I'd like to say this film's reputation for ultra-violence is not justified. There's very little violence, instead we get character development, wonderful performances, brilliant storytelling. George H. loaned me the video and said ""Just watch it."" I thought, Oh, sure; I'm just crazy about seeing a 3 hour Japanese movie with subtitles. Since then I bought my own VHS copy and have seen it 4 times. In theaters, this played Washington DC at first only at the Georgetown Theater, after the inferior remake ""The Magnificent 7"" had made the rounds, then in a truncated 2 hour version. Glad I missed that. With 3 hours, Kurasawa wasted not one solitary minute of screen time. Too bad so few people have seen this film; too bad we no longer have repertory cinemas playing the real classics."
torresarroba,"Jan 30, 2007",10/10,"Seven Letters Oh my God!!!Im going to be honest OK, I only went to see this because it was in the Top 250 IMDb movies. I went totally expecting to hate this movie because it was black and white. I'm amazed to say that it's AWESOME! While not an action picture there's plenty of action and drama. You've gotta see it. It's very inspiring, believe it or not this is a real samurai movie. It just made me appreciate freedom and love even more.Now I know why Seven Samurai is usually regarded as one of the greatest films ever made and is also one of a select few Japanese films to become widely known in the West, and is the subject of both popular and critical acclaim; it consistently ranks in the top ten movies on the IMDb Top 250 List and was voted onto Sight & Sound's list of the ten greatest films of all time in 1982 and 1992, and it remains on the director's top ten films in the 2002 poll. Sorry for my ignorance.This movies in now one of my favorites of all times!!!!!"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Nov 12, 2004",9/10,"I haven't seen any of Akira Kurosawa's other films, but I hear that this is his best, so maybe that's a good place to start(and maybe not). From the very first frame I was captivated by this film, and very interested in it. Then after about five minutes of watching, I realized how slow it was moving; ""Fine,"" I thought, ""it'll probably pick up later on"". But it didn't. The film stays in the same uncompromisingly slow pace for the entire runtime which is about three hours(more or less, depending on which cut/version you see). That's OK, don't get me wrong, but it brings the movie down. The film is epic, and truly astounding. It's a shame that it's so long and slow. The plot is great. The acting is very good, and great in some cases(for the most part, actually). The film contains a multitude of interesting, well-developed characters... but maybe that's part of the problem; there are too many of them. By the end of the film, I found myself being able to keep up with who was who, and as the credits came on, I couldn't really remember any of the names(though that may have something to do with them being in Japanese). The film has plenty of good dialog, though several of the characters spout lines that sound like they come from fortune cookies, but given just a little thought, they are quite profound. The film is called the first actual action film, due to the use of many plot points that have later ended up being clichés. The film has so much going for it, but at the end, I found myself barely paying attention. Maybe the film is too long for its own good... maybe I have a too short attention spam to fully enjoy the film(which is said to be a masterpiece, which I definitely won't argue with)... I don't know. In the end, after carefully going over all of the pros and cons of the film, I find myself rating it a nearly perfect 9/10. Too many low points to it to merit a perfect 10, but far too many high points to rate it any lower, even if I didn't particularly care for the last part of the movie(which probably has more to do with my attention spam than the content of that part of the movie). The cinematography is excellent. The film is very, very well-done overall, but seems a little too long and slow, and is hurt(in any other part of the world) by the very obvious Japanese culture/nature of the film, which is a little hard to accept, especially for us Westerners. It is a great film, though, and I can't argue with its placement on the top 250 best films of all time here on IMDb(it's #5 as I'm writing this). As a final note; to anyone out there who want to see the movie but are worried about violent content: everything is only implied. Much like Hitchcock, Kurosawa obviously realized the effect of only implying violence, and as a result, most people can watch the film. Most people will probably enjoy (at least) parts of it, but I fear few will watch the whole thing through. Since I barely did so myself, I can't really say anything to keep you watching all the way through to the end; but I will say that the film is visually impressive, contains some great acting, some humane and credible characters that the audience will be able to sympathize and identify with. I recommend the film to just about anyone who is interested in watching it. However, if there are action/Samurai fans out there, craving for fight scenes and Katana action, I will say this; Look elsewhere. This has very little of such, and what there is, is only implied. Watch this movie, but watch it for the drama, not the hope of fight scenes. 9/10"
PineyWoodsSlim,"May 6, 2002",8/10,"A very enjoyable film, and as you probably know, the basis for The Magnificent Seven.  The film is well-done and addresses class issues as well as the idea of justice.  My only complaints (and the only reasons I did not give it a 9), and they are small, are that the characters' motivations were not explored as much as I would have liked and the strategy of the Seven for defending the village should have been more in depth because strategy is an aspect dwelt upon early in the film in several other instances.  Still, give this film its due:  it set the stage for many following (and sadly, lesser) American Westerns as well as Japanese films.  I own it, but if you are not a ""film buff"" I suggest renting it and then deciding if you should own it. It is long and unless you're really into the film it will seem to move somewhat slowly."
madbandit20002000,"Mar 12, 2008",10/10,"Growing up, I thought of Japan as the home of anime and giant monster films. Then, while attending college, I saw ""The Seven Samurai"". I was proved wrong by this film, which is considered to be the magnum opus of celebrated filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, by movie historians. They're right.1587 is the year in Japan and the story's setting. Previously, the nation was ruled by a shogunate (the shogun being the Imperial Army's commander) with the emperor reduced to powerless figurehead. However, unavoidable civil wars came, caused by ambitious daimyo (local warlords), who wanted power, no matter what.In this epic tale (co-written by Kurosawa, Shinobu Hashimoto and Hideo Oguni, all who worked Kurosawa's ""Ikiru""), a poor, humble farming village and its' residents are constant victims of a bandit clan. Rice and sex are the group's goals, and they break carelessly the villagers' spirits. What to do? The local authorities are inept, and suicide, for a farmer, is giving up.""We hire samurai,"" the village elder strongly suggests. A quartet of farmers, with a pillar of rice as payment, does that, employing seven individualistic but noble ronin (samurai without masters). There's Kambei (Takashi Shimura of the original ""Godzilla"" and other Kurosawa works), the valiant leader; Gorobei (Yoshio Inaba), a good second-in-command; Shichiroji (Daisuke Kato), a battlefield acquaintance of Kambei; Heihachi (Minoru Chiaki), an optimist; Kyuzo (Seiji Miyaguchi), a perfect killing machine; Katsushiro (Isao Kimura), a green, wet-eared boy and the unforgettable Kikuchiyo (famed Kurosawa player Toshiro Mifune), a wild dog yet perfectly human goofball. Together, they're a force of nature, bounded by courage, honor and self-sacrifice.If you don't like a foreign, subtitled, black and white, three hours and twenty seven minute film, which ""Samurai"" is (and more), you need to be committed at once, post haste (I also adored ""Grindhouse"", which is sixteen minutes less). Under Kurosawa's direction, the film has a jackrabbit's pulse, a wolf's ferocity and a lamb's serenity. It's fascinating that both camps (samurai and farmer) learn from each other while fighting the enemy. Even two reps, despite their social standing (born in a role, die in a role) fall in love; the passion between Katsushiro and Shino (Keiro Tsushima), a young woman whose fool father has cut part of her hair to ""protect her from the samurai"", is subtlety passionate.As the resident clown, Mifune's so idiosyncratically human, he's almost American, being no surprise that he influenced Clint Eastwood (The Man With No Name trilogy) and the late John Belushi (the samurai skits on ""Saturday Night Live""; the Bluto role on ""Animal House""). The battle scenes are fierce and kinetic; it's hard to distinguish whether this work is real or fiction, and that's what makes ""Samurai"" brilliant. The actors, besides Mifune, are great too, honest in their emotions.What more praise can I deemed upon ""Samurai"", other than its' director has influenced the likes of Leone, Peckinpah, Scorcese, Lucas, Rodriguez, Miller, Tarantino, Cannell and others? It's just damn cool. The American western remake, ""The Magnificent Seven"", is reliable but comes short, if compared to ""Samurai"", being star-studded and Hollywood polished. Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch"" is a better, if unofficial, remake.If you buy the three-disc DVD from Criterion (expensive but worth it), you'll be forever enchanted. Give some honor to ""The Seven Samurai"", and enjoy."
Jacubek,"Jun 28, 2007",9/10,"Like probably everyone else who haven't seen this movie, I also had huge expectations on it. This is one of those movies which I was ashamed of not seeing, as it's still a classic in the history of motion pictures and the one of Akira Kurosawa's films that is described as ""a must-see"" for every movie freak there is. Having an 8.8/10 rating and standing on the mighty 9th place at IMDb's Top 250 movies of all time -list it's pretty hard to watch it without having those huge expectations. The movie tells a story about a village which is constantly attacked and robbed by bandits. The village's eldest wise man suggests that the villagers should hire samurais, respected warriors, to defend the village, so some of the villagers leave their home to find samurais for the job. It doesn't take so much time until they find the ones, and these samurais form the group of the seven samurais, who each have their own personalities and ways of interacting.First of all, you really have to relate to the time when the movie was produced. It's nothing near the movies these days, it's completely different, obviously. I've watched a lot of Japanese movies in the past and this is no exception when it comes to this certain style of this specific tension seen from the screen. I wouldn't say it's boring, but it's somehow tedious. I mean, the movie requires this certain mood for the viewer, so you can't really watch it like any other film. The tempo is slow and sometimes the scenes seem like they're too lengthened, which needs a lot of concentration and nerves, yet it's all worth it after all. The tempo of ""Shichinin no samurai"" has this nice way of speeding up towards the end, so it gets faster and faster all the time, though there are some of those slow scenes between. I can't really describe those scenes in any other way than ""slow"", as it's really hard to explain it after all. Over three hours of one movie is always pretty heavy, no matter what the movie itself was. This is a heavy movie, but that doesn't mean it wouldn't be worth watching. The music is these dark and gloomy orchestrations, which really fit in the main theme of the movie so well and though it doesn't include relaxed or soothing compositions it still is overall a great experience, composed by Fumio Hayasaka it builds up tension in a flowing way and it's sort of adapted in the exactly right places. It definitely has that 50's feel to it, but it's still original.One thing that immediately crosses your mind when the movie progresses itself is how incredibly well it's made considering when it is actually made. If you look at the 50's, there weren't any computers so CGI was obviously out of question. This basically means that everything you see on the screen is actually the real deal, everything that moves actually moves and everything that happens actually happens. This is what you have to pay attention to when you're watching the movie, as then you finally realise why it truly was such a big hit back then and why it immediately formed itself as a classic. A born legend some could say. The cinematography compliments the whole credibility the film offers for the viewer. It is a little bit different than Japanese cinematography nowadays, but there's still that same feeling and emotion. To me as a fan of Japanese cinematography ""Shichinin no samurai"" didn't disappoint me; Wide endless landscapes, those beautiful boundless hills and lands, it's honestly always a treat for you. Japanese also tend to use so much more still shots than any other nation and that is one of the things that form that certain well-known feeling and emotion.When you really relate to the time the directing doesn't disappoint you either. It's no wonder people have been buzzing about this film for ages as it is indeed Akira Kurosawa's masterpiece, a real specimen of skill. The thing that surprised me though was that the role performances can actually be compared to role performances these days, in Japanese films that is. The acting in this movie still has that certain anger, that somehow believable incredibility, that Japanese original way of acting, which also can not be compared to any other nation. Japanese films live in their own time and hopefully that'll always be the case, as when you're bored of Hollywood you can always change to a different perspective; The Japanese perspective.""Shichinin no samurai"" is timeless. It doesn't matter if you'd watch it even after 100 years from its release, it's a movie everyone should see, though it does require certain age from the viewer. This is not a movie for children after all as it's pretty violent too. Having huge expectations on a movie always gets me so stressed and to be really honest I thought the movie would have been better. But as a person in my 20's what can you really expect from a movie made in the 50's? It's like eating the same cereals years after years and then suddenly changing to porridge with sugar and milk in it. It's like drinking a long drink and then changing to whiskey. The difference gap is just so huge. ""Shichinin no samurai"" is a brilliant film if you can relate to the time, though it is pretty long-winded it does get better after a few days when you've seen it. You don't really ""get it"" at first, but just give yourself some time to repeat the events occurred in the movie and soon you see yourself perceiving the whole meaning of the movie, what's it all about and what it tries to tell you, the whole purpose of it. Magnificent indeed."
lagudafuad,"Oct 1, 2012",6/10,"Nothing beats a well thought of plan to ward off bandits. Samurai movies always show cases the best of swordsmanship, but this movie shows that a well thought strategic plan is better than a battalion of armed soldiers.This Japanese adventure drama film was co-written and directed by Akira Kurosawa.The film takes place in 1587 and it follows the story of a village of farmers that were constantly being raided by bandits who steal their crops during the time of harvest.The villagers then decided to go source for help, they hired seven masterless samurai (ronin) to come help defend their village.The movie is long, and it takes its time to build up to the defence of the city, but if you can manage to keep awake till then, what you will notice is mastery in camera footage, the cinematography is flawless, the editing can use a bit of touch up here and there, but the cinematography was just exceptional. My favourite shooting will be in the time when the rain was coming down and you will see how Akira managed to make the best of camera tricks to pass the message of a messy battle.The movie though made in 1954, has some wonderful display of acting, well i would advise if you have 3 hours to spear get the DVD, just try to stay awake till the last 40mins it is worth it."
jdkraus,"Feb 2, 2007",10/10,"I've heard much praise of the Seven Samurai for a long time. After seeing a couple of oriental action films like Hero and Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon; I decided to see this movie. I have come late in seeing it, back in 2004, (the 50 year anniversary), and I have to say that I have never been consumed by such a movie in a very long time.It is a straightforward film that reveals an unknown tale about a group of farmers who had been ravaged by bandits. Wondering what to do, they call upon their elder, who tells them to hire samurai warriors to defend them from the vicious bandits. This is one of those few movies that tells a whole tale from start to finish without any delays or plot holes. It is all understandable and easy to grasp. The three and half hour film flew by with no drags or any sign of boredom. I was engulfed by it.Not only was its storytelling great, but the cast was amazing. Every single cast member gave not only believable, but also moving performances, particularly by Tishorio Mifune, who played the hot-headed Kikuchiyo. Each character can be either loved or hated, there is no ""wooden"" acting in this film.The action sequences alone, in its time, and by today's standards are fantastic, both intense and engulfing simultaneously; well captured by Akira Kurosawa (whom since I've become a fan of). This may have been a cheaply done film, but it delivers the four things that a film needs to carry out: story, characters, film-making quality, and a flowing pace. it's guaranteed that this movie delivers it all! every movie that is either an oriental action flick, or a modern-day epic, must be compared to the Seven Samurai!-Since then, I have not seen one movie better than this film; it is among my top five favorites!"
xmdbx,"Jan 27, 2020",7/10,"It's tough to rate these types of movies, in my opinion. The influence is clear, there's no argument from me on that. But, the actual film doesn't hold up as well as I'd hoped. It is an action movie. I'm sure that meant something much different when it was released than it does now. Action movies have since worked off of the same tropes movies like Seven Samurai invented and as a result often come off as stale. It's not through any fault of its own but the film is lacking and its because the genre and the narrative style has been beaten into the ground since it's release. There have just been thousands of movies about gathering a crew to fight against impossible odds."
kenjha,"Oct 20, 2008",4/10,"This is universally regarded as one of the greatest films in cinematic history, but the emperor is wearing no clothes! The film has the visual elegance one would expect from a great director, but a great director also elicits good performances from his cast. This is where Kurosawa fails. While Shimura is fine as the leading samurai, much of the acting in this film is overly theatrical and melodramatic. Mifune is supposed to be endearing and funny, but his over-the-top acting makes his character most annoying. The narrative is not compelling enough to sustain a length of three and half hours. The final battle scenes are so drawn out that they lose their sense of excitement."
freakinsweetkamehameha,"Jan 12, 2006",10/10,"As the offspring of a learned, cultured, if not a bit weird,dad. I was introduced to foreign films at an early age. I first saw 'The seven samurai' at around the age of six or seven. Though I enjoyed the film- I hadn't realised its sheer brilliance until a later age. Earlier this year, my dad received 'the seven samurai' on DVD as a gift. I watched it and was blown away.'The seven samurai is an insight into 15th century (I think) Japan and the way things work. The village around which the film is based is attacked every harvest by bandits. On overhearing when the bandits will attack next, the villagers come upon a plan of action. They are to hire samurai (skilled warriors, much like knights) to fight the bandits. What follows is the epic which has survived decades and is still seen as one of the greatest films of all time.With mind-blowing cinematography and a feudal soundtrack- the seven samurai is a must-see!"
Imaginist,"Feb 26, 2006",10/10,"Synopsis: ""Seven Samurai"" is the story of seven samurais (duh) who are hired by poor farmers to protect their village from pillaging bandits. This is Akira Kurosawa's finest film and it is probably the first modern action flick ever made. The film begins quite slowly as we watch several farmers recruit samurai warriors to come to their aid. This takes up the first half of the three hour long movie, and at times it can become a bit boring. However, this phase of the film is absolutely necessary. It allows Kurosawa to introduce each of his beloved characters and flush them out in full detail.As soon as the viewer starts to wonder where all the supposed ""action"" is, he is delighted to find that the last half of the feature is an extravagant battle between the forces of good (the samurais and villagers) and evil (the bandits). It is here that Kurosawa really shows his skill. He invents the ""final climatic battle sequence"" that we see in every action film made after this one. The battle is a rush, and because we know and love the characters we can truly appreciate the conflict; we worry about their well-being.As one might have guessed, the heroes are successful and the small village survives the siege, but it is not without a heavy price: there are many who die. Of course, we only care for the heroes who die, not for the villains. We scarcely know these marauding bandits; they are simply nameless enemies. At first, one might see this as a weakness in the story. It appears to be a simplistic way of looking at the world: only the good guys are human and the evil folks are just mindless minions. However, I believe that this is an appropriate choice on Kurosawa's part. Although it is true that the people we often label as villainous or evil have a good side to them, this film's purpose is to focus solely on heroic individuals. This is Kurosawa's tribute to the selfless and perhaps reluctant hero.""Seven Samurai"" is a cinematic masterpiece. Kurosawa masterfully blends characters, story, camera techniques (every shot is carefully constructed and adequately done), and music to create one of the most influential films ever conceived. Kurosawa is a true master of his craft and this is his tour-de-force. ""Seven Samurai"" rightly deserves: 5 out of 5 stars."
Jag85,"Mar 29, 2009",N/A,"The only other Akira Kurosawa film I had seen before this was Rashomon, which I watched for the first time last week. After hearing much about The Seven Samurai, I also decided to watch this film today for the first time.The first thing I noticed when I started watching the film is the incredibly long length: 3 hours and 27 minutes. I must admit that I initially wasn't terribly excited at the prospect of sitting through a single film for such a long period of time. Nevertheless, by the time the first half-hour of the film had passed, I found myself hooked.I'm not really sure where to begin, but I guess Kurosawa's superb direction might be a good place to start. Like Rashomon, the direction for The Seven Samurai was well ahead of its time. In terms of cinematography, he made effective use of some of the techniques he had previously pioneered in Rashomon, one of his most influential examples being the way in which he points the camera up towards the sun, with the sunlight glaring onto the screen. I found these shots impressive in Rashomon and am equally impressed by them here in The Seven Samurai.The story itself was also well ahead of its time. The now-common plot element of recruiting and gathering a ragtag group of protagonists for a specific goal began with this film and went on to inspire many later films, though none of them were able to surpass the original. I had already seen some of those inspired films beforehand, but what sets The Seven Samurai apart is its greater sense of realism, something which later inspired films seem to be lacking. The realistic aspect of the film truly shines during the battle sequences in the last hour of the film. They are possibly the most realistic and yet exciting battle scenes I have ever seen on film. There wasn't much melodrama either and most of the film barely has a background score to it (some scenes did have it but I found the music largely forgettable), and yet the film was powerful and incredibly moving, especially the ending.As for the acting, Toshiro Mifune was again impressive just like he was in Rashomon. While I thought his acting was slightly more versatile in Rashomon, his performance as 'Kikuchiyo' in The Seven Samurai was much more moving and really made me care for his character. Some of the other leading actors in Rashomon also returned in The Seven Samurai, such as Minoru Chiaki and Takashi Shimura, who gave a very impressive performance as the group leader Kambei. Other memorable performances in the film came from Seiji Miyaguchi and Isao Kimura. The only issue with the cast is the obvious lack of female characters, with the only notable one being Shino, who was portrayed reasonably well by Keiko Tsushima.Overall, Kurosawa has shown a lot of improvement with this film, as I found The Seven Samurai to be a superior film to Rashomon in nearly every way. In fact, The Seven Samurai is now one of my favourite films of all time, second only to Satyajit Ray's 'The Apu Trilogy' (1955-1959), which also happen to be from the 1950s. In my opinion, it was quite possibly the greatest decade for films, with 'The Apu Trilogy' and 'The Seven Samurai' being the finest examples from that era.10/10"
shibby_uk,"Oct 19, 2005",10/10,"For those of us who love classical music there is Mozart, Bach, and Beethoven.For those of us who love literature there is Shakespeare, Dostoevsky, and Umberto Eco.For those of us who love films and film-making, there is...KUROSAWA.This film is the greatest representation of his enormous talent and genius. Toshiro Mifune and Takashi Shimura are superb in their respective roles of wild one (Mifune) and brave and honourable leader (Shimura). No words can adequately describe the sheer brilliance and completeness of this incredible work of art. It carries you off to a very special place, I suppose that's the best that I can do."

The attention to detail and authenticity is just beyond belief. The acting seems fantastic, the characters are truly lovable. The film at first impressions seems a bit long, but its well worth it. It puts films like the last samurai to shame. this film is just pure epic! a great masterpiece by Akira Kuwosawa. This is certainly one of my most favourite films of all time! i can no complaints. i am pleased its a PG(UK) as it allows everyone to see it. There is no blood and gore and no stupid exaggerated scenes everything just seems so real. I wish i could go back to the 50s and watch them film it also to see it at the cinema would be immense.Just go NOW! and get it buy rent however but make sure you watch it!"
gftbiloxi,"Apr 1, 2005",10/10,"Clocking in at just under four hours with not a scrap of filler, Kurosawa's THE SEVEN SAMURAI is every bit as legendary at its enthusiasts would have you believe.The basic story is extremely simple. In a period of social chaos, a small farming village learns it will once more be attacked by a band of thirty bandits after the harvest. At first the farmers despair, but village elder Gisaku (Kokuten Kodo) recalls that in his childhood a similar village met a similar situation by hiring Samurai to defend them. The villagers accordingly send representatives to the city, where they are able to convince Samurai Kambei Shimada (Takashi Shimura) to undertake the defense.If the plot sounds familiar, it should: Hollywood would translate it into the extremely popular 1960 western THE MAGNIFICENT SEVEN--but fine though that film is, it pales beside THE SEVEN SAMURAI, which effectively turns an action film premise into a character study of the first order and endows the story with both tremendous simplicity and artistry. Much of this is due an extraordinary ensemble cast, which includes the celebrated Toshiro Mifune (who would later appear in Kurosawa's THRONE OF BLOOD and YOJIMBO); above this, however, is Kurosawa's remarkable vision that draws upon the visual motif of the circle.The circle is a powerful presence in SAMURAI. The village is presented as a roughly circular pattern of houses; the farmers meet in circles; in due time the Samurai enter the circle and stand at the center of the circle, directing the defense--and indeed the circle will become the defense, as Shimada works to find means to draw the bandits into the circle and to their doom. The motif will be elaborated: tied to the cycle of seed time, growth time, and harvest; tied to the cycle of life; and ultimately showing the quiet bitterness of life for those who operate outside the circular codes of community: the ""Ronin,"" the Samurai who have no master and no community, and whose lives are not valued by the community except for aid at a moment of crisis.Shot in simple black and white, as much (if not more) a detailed character and culture study as it is an action film, THE SEVEN SAMURAI is extremely simple and yet extremely subtle, and ultimately one of the most powerful films it has been my pleasure to review. The quality of the Criterion DVD transfer is very good, but by no means flawless--although it survives well, the film has not been digitally restored, and artifacts are frequent. There is little in the way of bonus material, but the commentary by Michael Jeck is quite fine. Strongly recommended.GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
elision10,"Jul 18, 2020",7/10,"This movie, like me, was a lot younger 40 years ago. It's now (again, for me) a classic more to be respected than adored. It's now hackneyed at times. And I'm not sure what to make of Mifune's acting, whether it's something special or just over the top. Anyway, you'll probably get through it with some pleasure; but by the end, you may be happy it's over."
winner55,"Aug 1, 2006",10/10,"general statement of principle; I am sick to death of commercial filmmakers preying on the young by obscuring the fact that, as filmmakers, they have nothing original to say or do, by chewing up the past and spitting it out again with ""new, improved"" special FX.yet, judging from some of the reviews i read here the sad fact is that many young viewers are not only ignorant of film history, they earnestly wish to remain ignorant.what could possibly be gained by a surrender to one's own ignorance. an ignorant man has to be told what to do and what to think. simply rejecting the advice of one's elders does not constitute freedom of thought - it is exactly when we reach a decision contrary to that of our peers that we discover what it may mean to become an individual.this means, of course, that statistical arguments concerning the uselessness of history are wholly unconvincing. to say that 'most people agree with me on this point' doesn't say that the point is well-made; possible everyone in agreement with it is simply wrong.to assert one's independence and then turn around and say that the 'majority agree' is self-evidently contradictory. to abide by such statements despite evidence and reasonable disproof, is not simply exposing ignorance m- which can be corrected through education - it is simply stupid.furthermore, since an ignorant person has to be told what to think, it follows that such a person is a victim waiting for a crime to happen. such people seem proud of their ability to thumb their noses at people who reach out to help - but they easily and quickly fall victim to con-artists, who usually know how to make such people feel good about the victimization.knowledge of history means; not getting scammed for want of it. it means deepening one's awareness of the strengths and faults of those we admire. it means that we learn the tricks used to produce something of value, thus making it easier to find and judge value.in film it is also well to bear in mind that good film-makers are precisely those who have studied film history the most. this gives them a stock of film-techniques developed by others on which to draw for increased effectiveness of their own films. i find it unclear, why it is young viewers of today wish to remain in ignorance of where the contemporary film-maker draws inspiration.this fact blasts away the commonly proffered assertion, 'we do things better now than anything they did 'back when'. if that were true, then the film-makers of today would not need such inspiration; but they do.finally, it is simply a fact that those who profess ignorance - as a desirable quality - are simply incapable of saying anyone might be able to learn. they always get basic facts wrong.the seven samurai; is not an action film, it is a period adventure film with both action elements but also, and more importantly, elements of serious drama.i read one young reviewer say that the character development in the seven samurai is unimportant. obviously this person just doesn't like people; so i supposed he will eventually betray his friends or get betrayed.because the importance of the character development in the first half of this film is that some of us happen to like human beings and want to understand better what makes them do the things they do - and what makes some of their actions mistakes - sometimes fatal mistakes.as the remarks of the lead samurai imply, the biggest mistake this men made was becoming samurai. but that being the hand life has dealt them, they need to play it out as best they can - and as gracefully as they can.Hemingway once remarked that what truly made a man was 'grace under fire' - and i seem to recall he admitted that he had heard of this as a volunteer with the Italian army during the first world war, that this was the quality the Italians admired most about Americans.well, that's what this film is about - not the action, but the 'grace under fire' that the samurai learn about themselves, and also teach the villagers. or those villagers willing to be taught. when someone is not willing to be taught, that one is not worthy of teaching - in which case bandits can rape, rob, and slaughter them, and no one would care.finally one must point out the tasteless ignorance of insisting that a film is weak because - heaven forbid - it's not in color. that's sort of like saying 'your father's a fag because he hasn't gotten your mom pregnant in years'. - it is wholly irrelevant to any movie whatsoever, to be sure, a director can handle color well - but he or she can handle black and white lighting and composition equally well.there is no 'nature photography' in the seven samurai. there are stunningly beautiful and haunting images in black and white.if you care about film, you owe it to yourself to see the film; had it never been made, neither would any contemporary films that you enjoy today, or that you may enjoy tomorrow.and if that doesn't sink in - then, screw it - i've no patience for fools.still one of the best films in the history of cinema, and still a film necessary to see and appreciate."
olivier_leemans,"Mar 21, 2004",7/10,"Just want to say i can't understand why seven samourai is ranked so high on the IMDB ranking. It's a good movie allright, but it's far from perfect: it's too long, sometimes boring, especially the first part of the movie before the farmers decide to hire samourai and also the search of the seven samourai is not great (at least not as good as in the magnificent seven). There aren't real samourai fight scenes in it, the bandits almost never appear in the movie and when they do appear they are so stupid they make the same mistake each attack...I think the magnificent seven is a better movie. John Sturges cut out the less good scenes from seven samourai, used the wonderful story and made a magnificent western."
ttreakle,"Jul 5, 2023",1/10,"I was anticipating something great, something historic but what I got was three and a half hours of nothing. This is a movie that could've easily been told in 90 minutes. Instead it's drawn out with pointless scenes and dialogue not to mention the samurai were boring. I can't believe this is considered one of the greatest movies of all time. This was a snooze fest. The characters weren't interesting the story ,direction wasn't good. For the most part I hardly ever agree with rotten tomatoes and again I strongly disagree with that 100% rating. This was very disappointing and I'm glad I don't have ever watch this again.Tim Treakle."
charleswjoke,"Oct 1, 2013",9/10,"Seven Samurai is a great action movie. It has the plot of all of our modern team action flicks such as The Avengers, Ocean's Eleven and MacGruber (just the top of my head). The heroes are a team that slowly forms during the first half of the film and the second part of the film is some form of a ""heist"" movie with the planning of traps and strategies, with some very intense action scenes between the ""graceful"" samurai and the bandits. The samurai are really the stars of the show: interesting and fleshed out characters that you really love during the course of the film. The relationships between the characters are also interesting. It's true that this film is quite daunting: black and white, quite long (you can see it in two times, there is an intermission even though it has a bigger emotional impact if you stay with the samurai for the whole film straight) and subtitled. But the trip is worth it, you will not forget this classic ode to the ancient and legendary samurai."
dee.reid,"Sep 9, 2006",10/10,"...There was ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), famed director Akira Kurosawa's towering martial arts action epic of mythical proportions. Action-packed with a wry sense of humor, the plot concerns seven ronin (master-less samurai) who are assembled by the distraught, desperate villagers of a small farm community to fend off the bandits that have been terrorizing them. ""Seven Samurai"" is the second film of Kurosawa's I've seen within the last year, the first being ""Yojimbo"" (1961), which also featured a strong, centralized performance from acclaimed actor Toshiro Mifune. ""Seven Samurai"" is seen as the movie that helped shape Western action films, even though Kurosawa himself was said to be heavily influenced by American westerns. ""Seven Samurai"" was eventually remade into ""The Magnificent Seven"" (1960), itself a popular movie in the United States but lacked the flair of its inspired source material. The actors, including lead Takashi Shimura as Kambei, are flawless, as well as the many supporting players who were the farmers. My personal favorite is Mifune's Kikuchiyo, who absolutely steals the show as a humorous, loathsome troublemaker with a dirty mouth, but earns his heroism in an honest, self-sacrificing fashion. The bandits themselves remain mostly faceless, ghostly figures on horseback, though it's easy to compare them somewhat to the portrayal of Native-Americans in American westerns. Although it's over three hours long, the centerpiece of ""Seven Samurai"" is its climatic siege, which eats up nearly the remaining hour. It's agonizing, grueling combat where many die and you are left questioning the title. But, instead of giving us one long, drawn-out sequence, Kurosawa made the genius choice and has the battle broken up into several skirmishes, with moments of contemplation and anguish between. ""Seven Samurai"" is a beautifully realized epic of mythic stature, one of the great pieces from one of the greatest directors to ever pick up a camera.10/10"
stpierre-1,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"After being somewhat disappointed by Rashomon, I came into this movie without high expectations. What a mistake. This is one of the best movies I've ever seen -- bar none. Was it three and a half hours long? I didn't notice.Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune turn in absolutely incredible performances, especially Shimura; where both (I felt) overacted in Rashomon, Mifune fits wonderfully into his role and Shimura is flat out brilliant as the restrained master. Even the stoic swordsman -- I can't recall his name -- was a stock character, but acted to perfection.Some reviews complain about the action sequences, but I found them brilliant because -- get ready for this, Gladiator fans -- they were *realistic.* They accurately depicted the fights as they would be between a handful of terrified farmers with bamboo spears and a handful of terrified bandits with secondhand swords: messy and inelegant. The samurai, too, fight accurately: they wait for their opening and strike fatally. There's none of the half-hour one-on-one knife fights you get in modern ""action epics""; no one gets hacked to bits and keeps on going, and I appreciated the hell out of that.The ending, though, was the most brilliant part. If it weren't for the last two minutes and Shimura's cynical (but true!) closing comment, this would be a typical, though outstanding, action film. The last two minutes -- and the trademark twist that Kurosawa throws into what seems like all of his movies -- *make* the movie. I won't give anything away; it simply has to be seen."
tomimt,"Nov 24, 2005",9/10,"It might be silly to write another review of this great film, but what can one do? It's so darn impressive film.Seven Samurai tells a story of a small village, which is in the firm grip of a band of brigands, who steal their harvest and rape their women. The villagers are fed up and they head out to big city to hire a samurai to protect them. They soon hire Kambei (Takashi Shimura), who helps the villagers to hire six more samurais. Soon the band of seven head to the village and they begin to plan their defence.The movie is long, over three hours, but interestingly enough there are no unnecessary scenes in it. Kurosawa takes his time to tell the story just the way he want's to tell it. There actually isn't much of action in the film, when you think about it: action is part of the story, but only in a narrative sense. There is no unnecessary violence.I could recommend this film to everyone, but I've found myself, that you need to acquire a taste towards Japanese acting, as it often is more theatrical than in western movies (thought before 70's it often was very theatrical in all movies, not just Japanese ones.). But after you've done that, there's nothing to stop you enjoying about this film."
nox09,"Jan 3, 2015",10/10,"Seven Samurai"" is the greatest filmmaking ever . Every scene is necessary and perfectly directed. Kurosawa succeed to make a perfect movie that will combine drama ,comedy, romance , philosophy and definitely most powerful. dynamic and intense battle scenes ever filmed ,( nowadays directors should watch it and learn how to direct a battle scene ) .despite 200 minutes of running time ""Seven Samurai"" doesn't bore at all. this movie has such a strong spirit it's epic . the storyline is strong and the character's are amazing ,each of them is very well developed, which gives the movie more depth. visually the movie looks beautiful , pure and perfect cinematography . Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time a lot of movies nowadays use techniques from him. they way he used weather to set atmosphere and mood , the Rashomon's effect , transition between the scenes etc i can talk about this movie all day long and it still wont be enough it's a movie for generations..... a true masterpiece of cinema"

panchodh_12,"Sep 16, 2014",6/10,"I don't know, I guess I can't help but belong to my own generation. I was going through other user reviews and forum discussions and I simply couldn't understand what was so superlative about this movie. Don't get me wrong, I liked it, but is definitely not one of my all-time favourites, and it wasn't that I just couldn't stop watching it.The main problem I found with this movie, I think, was the pace. It was such a slooow movie, and there were so many, from my point of view, useless or too-long shots... That's why I said that I can't help but belong to my own generation. I was just looking at my ratings and the longest movie to which I gave a 10 was 148 minutes long, that's exactly one hour less than this movie. I'm guessing that's a runtime much more fit for these times of Twitter and low attention span; I'm guessing perhaps Ray Bradbury was right and in some future we will all watch nothing but 10-minutes long movies posted on YouTube.Or maybe it's just another way of conceiving the movie-watching experience. Not right, not wrong but different. Perhaps the public in 1954 was much more disposed to watch a 207-minutes long movie, because going to the movies was already a big social event in itself, while in these times, we just stream the movie online in the solitude of our rooms.But all in all, it is a good movie. It is entertaining and the characters are well-developed. Toshirô Mifune's character is by far the best of this movie, and his acting is quite remarkable. The plot is simple, but Kurosawa managed to denote complexity within that simplicity. The scene of the night before the last battle, for example, says a thing or two about human nature.I guess I don't regret having watched it. After all, is quite a classic and everyone says it's Kurosawa's best film. But I wouldn't recommend it to anyone who is not into the history of cinema, and I do not intend to watch it again any time soon."

ipknip,"Feb 12, 2006",10/10,"The story of a small village plagued by bandits in feudal Japan. The movie follors the villagers attempts to stand up to the bandits by fortifying the village and hiring samurai protectors. This Kurosawa's most widely regarded film and rightly so. Superbly written and directed, with high action and emotion.Watch out for the star performance from Kurosawa regularly Toshiro Mifune as the drunk (Kikuchiyo).The story like so many of Kurosawa's works was later picked up by Hollywood director John Sturges and remade into one of the all-time western classics 'The Magnificent 7' starring amongst others Yul Brynner and a young Charles Bronson. The original story being so strong that even the remake turned out a good film. (And thats a rarity!!) Sit back and enjoy over 200 minutes of cinematic excellence."
TheUnknown837-1,"Dec 24, 2008",10/10,"At the time I wrote this review, Akira Kurosawa had recently, and very quickly, become one of my all-time favorite directors. I had only seen four of his films and given each and every one of them my highest rating. His greatest, and undoubtedly his most popular film was in 1954 epic Seven Samurai, which was the top-selling movie out of Japan for the year and won the Japanese Academy Award for Best Picture. Today, it's ranked one of the greatest motion pictures ever. And it rightfully holds that title.This is a spectacular film. Full of wonderful characters, spectacular scenery, and great performances all around, it is Kurosawa's fantastic story about a poor farming village in 16th century Japan being consistently placed under attack by marauding bandits. Facing starvation if the bandits raid them again, the peasants fearfully and reluctantly turn to seven unemployed samurai to defend themselves.There is no weak element to Seven Samurai. One of its greatest aspects is its characters. Every single one of them, farmer or samurai, is given tremendous development, making them memorable. This is one of those films where if a character gets killed off, you suddenly find yourselves missing their presence on film because you got to know them so well. I will not name him, but there was one ill-fated character in the film when, after he died, I felt kind of cheerless because I had come to respect him as a human being instead of an actor performing in front of a camera and reading out scripted dialogue. If you were to ask me which character was my favorite, I would be tied between two of them. The characters played by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, two of the finest Japanese actors who ever lived.Another thing I admire in Seven Samurai is the feeling of authenticity. The feeling that it all could have really happened. There are very few moments where the unbelievable occurs, as most action movies tend to succumb to. One thing I admired was the antagonists of the film: the bandits. Unlike most Hollywood movies where the bad guys have names and are introduced as characters to make them effective, the bandits in Seven Samurai all go without names. We only know them as ""the bandits"" and that is appropriate because that's all the characters know them as. Just marauding, murdering bandits who must be killed off as soon as possible.Kurosawa was undoubtedly one of the most influential directors of all time and that is clear in this film. Many of the transitions and techniques that motion pictures today seem to follow on a conventional level were inspired by this film: slow-motion, a ""fade"" wipe between scenes like what you see in the Star Wars movies, using the weather to affect emotion and atmosphere, a team forming to take on a larger enemy, the list goes on. The movie was so influential that it was remade here in the United States as The Magnificent Seven (1960), which I consider one of the greatest remakes ever. Not as good as its original sourcenot by a long shotbut considerably effective and noteworthy.In regards to the movie's soundtrack, it's a success. The music was composed by Fumio Hayasaka and it's wonderful. We seldom hear any of it, when we do, its an efficacious presence of impact. The opening score is very effective and the music that plays when the farmers are searching for samurai in the town remains one of my favorite soundtrack pieces today.There is one thing in the film that might warn off some viewers. It is long. At over three and a half hours in length, some people will be cautious before sitting down to view it and some will lose their patience, but to those who can sit down and enjoy a movie no matter how long it lasts, it will be realized as fast-moving storytelling. Like The Ten Commandments (1956), even the long takes and the slow pacing seems fast because it is so well-written and so masterfully directed by Kurosawa.One of the greatest masterpieces of all time. And now that it's been released in a wonderful three-disc collection here in the United States, its audience will continue to expand and its legacy will live on. That's the only kind of fate a masterpiece should have."
Thermo,"Jul 7, 1999",10/10,"This movie is so unbelievably powerful it's scary.  I've seen it over and over and over and I still shake at the end.  But if you do get a chance to see it on the big screen, do - it's one of those experiences that makes life worth living."
FANatic-10,"Aug 8, 2001",10/10,"One of the most influential films ever made, and still great almost 50 years after its premiere.  Seven Samurai is such a rich film, in so many ways, that a simple description really can't do it justice.  The photography and editing are utterly magnificent, every scene beautifully composed and lit. If you want to know what makes a film artful, just compare this film and every other merely proficient action film - you can see it immediately.Kurosawa gives each character detail and life, making them real and complex, even the smallest roles.  And there's not a subpar performance in the lot. I admit I found Toshiro Mifune a bit excessive at first as the animalistic, buffoonish Kikuchiyo, but the character gains in power as the film proceeds, and there's no denying Mifune's incredible physicality and intensity.  His famous monologue about farmers, delivered with helmet askew, is stunning - extraordinary acting.The famed battle scenes at the end are unforgettably harsh and noisy and dirty.  What's really amazing is that no stunt men were used, but real arrows were!  I love the kineticism of the scenes, shot using Kurosawa's famous 3 camera technique.  In all the scenes of people running, the camera seems to speed up also to kick up the film's adrenaline.  Kurosawa also memorably pioneered the use of slow motion in some scenes to underscore the moment brilliantly.  He does an amazing job of orchestrating the flow of the action throughout.  I also loved the scene with Rykichi's wife - Kurosawa takes less than a minute's worth of screen time to produce one of the most eloquent and eerie bits of silent acting since the days of Lillian Gish.Lyrical, rough, hilarious, heartbreaking, eloquent - I could supply an endless stream of adjectives.  This is just a film everyone who cares about movies should see.  The only time I mind a movie's length is when its a bad movie - this is possibly the best movie ever made, and every minute you spend watching it is well worth it!"
JiaQiLi,"Dec 19, 2006",10/10,"Unfortunately, I can give ten stars the most. I think that a 10/10 is an understatement of this film's excellence. Kurosawa does not choreograph major fights until the end of the film. However, he marvellously develops the character of each samurai and the peasants.""Seven Samurai"" is a sophisticated film and it goes much deeper than the battle against bandits. Samurai and peasants were drastically different classes in ancient Japan. They did not and could not interact with each other. Interestingly, Kurosawa brings them together in ""Seven Samurai"". Peasants fought off bandits in order to survive. Samurai helped the bandits in pursuit for virtue and justice.What happened eventually? The seven samurai and the entire class were the ultimate losers. It gradually went extinct in Japan. Some of them lost their virtues and characters, becoming bandits. Some of them could not find a lord and live as ronin (wandering samurai). Peasants were the big winners. They continued to live their routine as is.Were the peasants good? I do not believe so. They robbed samurai and stole weapons from them. They were so selfish that they only care for themselves. Peasants living in houses on the other side of the river bank refused to evacuate. They were so narrow minded and near sighted that they were incapable of considering the need of the entire village.I can keep on writing about ""Seven Samurai"" (particularly the symbol and the meaning of guns) but I shall stop here. This film is truly classic. Its characters, plot, and themes are so meticulously developed and presented that I do not experience a boring moment. Each actor (e.g. Toshiro Mifune, Takashi Shimura) and actress plays excellent roles too. Yes, it is three and a half hours long but I love every minute of it. If you think that you are a cinema lover, you must watch it. This film is old and it is black and white. However, it is so brilliant in all areas that many colour films cannot match. I strongly recommend people to purchase the DVD. Criterion releases a new edition this September. It is expensive but it is worth the money."
sside2075,"Aug 10, 2002",N/A,Seven Samurai is a good movie. But it's not as great as everyone on here likes to pretend it is. It's not even one of Kurosawa's better film. They say this movie began modern action films. I don't think so. Not much action here. This movie is well over 3 hours long and its quite boring at times. It's not exactly what an epic should be. But it is still a good movie nonetheless. I recommend seeing this but only if you're a Kurosawa fan. bye.
Roman0,"Mar 5, 2002",7/10,"Though I didn't like the whole story very much, there were still some parts that touched me: say, when we saw the old woman whined the bad deeds of the bandits; and the little love story between the veteran samurai and the young girl; then the man said that ""to protect others can protect yourselves"", though I don't quite grasped the meanings, I feel the saying is very touching, exposes the resolution of those samurais. The movie may also show some society things of the Japanese society at the time, but I didn't pay much attention.  As a foreigner, I only feel the Japanese-styled sayings and behaviors interesting.  And the Japanese music, played by a flute-thing, I feel it sounds like modem's singing."
mahmus,"Jun 28, 2020",10/10,"This three and a half hour long movie feels both epic and small in scale, and it's soo good that despite it's very long runtime, it feels like a two hour long movie.Akira Kurosawa brings to life a cast of characters that you immidiately get attached to, especially Kikuchiyo (Toshiro Mifune in probably his best role) who is by far one of my favorite movie characters of all time.This movie is something else. I love it so much."
filipemanuelneto,"Nov 25, 2022",6/10,"Well, I have to start this text with a note that I believe is relevant to understand what I'm going to write: this was the first Japanese film that I remember seeing. I might even be forgetting something I've seen before, but I don't think so. Therefore, I'm not a good connoisseur of Japanese cinema, so I don't want my opinion to be taken with any authority that I don't crave. I know there are people who want that. I do not. I speak, as in any of my reviews, only through my mouth, from the height of my meager wisdom, without pretensions. I may be right about some things, wrong about others, but that's the most normal thing in the world.I decided to see this film because it was highly recommended and well regarded... everyone said it was a very good film, so I decided to see it for myself. I just finished it, and read a little about the film and its director, the famous Akira Kurosawa. The film is really a work that is above average, but it is not the kind of film that pleases everyone, and it seems to me to be a little overvalued, which results in damage. I say this because I felt, at various times, that the film failed to meet my expectations, as I am quite neutral, that is, I neither love this type of film nor feel repugnance in watching it.The script takes place, roughly, in the mid-16th century, when Japan was divided into feuds and kingdoms, and there were frequent internecine wars in which the samurai took part. Of course, in such an environment, it is the common people who sacrifice themselves, and the humblest have always been the most susceptible to abuse by the powerful. That's what we have here, with a rural village that is regularly looted and devastated by an armed band until it decides to hire a small group of wandering samurai to help defend it. They achieve this objective, and we are invited to see all the labors that occur in the preparation of the defense, and in the martial training of those peasants.I'm going to do it differently, and start by saying the aspects that seemed most positive to me. First, it seems to me that Kurosawa is really meticulous in the work he has done and has great affection and respect for his country's traditions and history. Otherwise, one would not understand the effort and money that were tied up in a film with such a historical and cultural load. To what extent did his taste for realism influence European cinema, or vice versa? I'm sure there are film students who have discussed this. What I can guarantee is the commitment to realism, visible, for example, in the extraordinary design of the sets and costumes, and in the static cinematography, very elegant and sharp. The script is quite solid, and gives us an extraordinarily credible story and very well-built and striking characters. I don't know the actors well, but I think Toshiro Mifune deserves applause for the commitment and work he has done here. He is an actor who naturally captures our attention and has a charisma that comes through effortlessly.On the negative side, however, we also have several aspects to point out, starting with the length of the film, with more than three and a half hours. I'm sorry to say, but I feel that the script didn't justify that much time, and that Kurosawa didn't work the pace well. With a more restricted edition, he would have managed to reduce the film, without much loss, to two hours, and make it less heavy and exhausting. We don't need to see every village debate or every military training shenanigans. I also didn't like the attempts at humor introduced in the film. They just weren't funny at all. The excessive predictability of the story told also turns out to be a defect. I also didn't like the virtual absence of a soundtrack. I've seen that in other films, and I've never been particularly fond of that stylistic device."
richardarcher-90812,"Apr 11, 2021",1/10,Some true idiots on here fawning over this over-long over-acted rubbish.Let's just take the action scenes.A bunch of horses running back and forth with a bunch of people milling around. Utterly dreadful.It might have been different in its day but you are a complete fool if you think this is a good movie now.
bobsgrock,"Dec 15, 2008",10/10,"Perhaps the greatest Japanese film of all time and one of the best foreign films ever, Seven Samurai more than compensates for the 3 1/2 hour run time that holds us in its grasp. Some parts may feel a bit stretched or contrived, but the action sequences are absolutely thrilling cinema and some of the best ever shot on screen. Director Akira Kurosawa used multiple cameras to shoot these scenes, and as a result, the pace flows wonderfully and they look great.The acting is also very good, with Takashi Shimura shining as the leader Kambei. However, the best role is that of Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite muse and longtime partner in acting. His turn as the outsider samurai is truly impressive to watch as he prowls around like a lion full of energy, sensuality and fearlessness. There is also a very sweet and tender romance amidst all the hatred and violence that escalates to the climax.As mentioned before, this isn't an easy film to watch with the 200 minute running time and foreign language. But, if you take the time to watch it, you will witness a landmark in international cinema as perhaps the first action-adventure epic in movie history as well as a timeless story of honor, courage, and selflessness that defines a hero."
garg-hitesh-409-468237,"Nov 14, 2013",9/10,"If you haven't watched this movie; then you have watched nothing. This is a movie which contains every spice in it. Old is Gold. This movie is about how few men come together. They reignite their minds and soul. Got to know the true meaning of being samurai. On the journey helps other people, become a team. Fights for justice. A must watch movie. This movie touches your heart and soul. You can not wait to watch it again and again. Samurai's work only for handful of rice to eat because they understand that farmers can not pay them much. Even some times they share the food with poor farmers; which is really sentimental.Many characters die in ""Seven Samurai,"" but violence and action are not the point of the movie. It is more about duty and social roles. The samurai at the end have lost four of their seven, yet there are no complaints, because that is the samurai's lot. The villagers do not much want the samurai around once the bandits are gone, because armed men are a threat to order. That is the nature of society. The samurai who fell in love with the local girl is used significantly in the composition of the final shots. First he is seen with his colleagues. Then with the girl. Then in an uncommitted place not with the samurai, but somehow of them."
MarcoParzivalRocha,"Sep 22, 2020",10/10,"Seven samurai without a master (ronins) are recruited by villagers to protect a village from attacks by a group of bandits. It is considered by many critics and cinephiles to be the best samurai movie ever (I put it in my top 3). Everything in this story flows perfectly, starting with the meeting of the seven warriors, their personal conflicts, their ambitions and motives and the way they face battles. It is a film full of symbology (example number 7), with an unpredictable and chaotic narrative, which leaves us glued to the screen during the 3h:30m (yes, it is a very well spent afternoon). Visually it is a milestone in the history of cinema, using techniques and movements characteristic of Kurosawa that until today few can match. I saw this film in a movie theater this week, and I can say it was one of the best experiences in my life regarding films."
akhil-jaggarwal,"Aug 19, 2006",10/10,"For a die hard fan (fan - its an ambiguous word) of old Japanese movies, especially those depicting Samurai and the agonizingly painful period of civil war, Shichinin no samurai stands alone and proud, proud of its every single frame, every single dialogue and lastly, proud of its immortalized characters. I've seen quite a few civil war movies, Seppuku ('62), Onibaba ('64), Sanjuro ('62) and nearly all of Kurosawa's flicks, but the difference in them and the Seven Samurai lies in its experience. A good one hour into the movie and you'd want to live with the characters, fight with the samurais, curse the bandits and fall in love with a girl. The storyline of this movie is of epic proportions, not even close to any movie you'd have encountered till now, and the way the minutest element of the film is handled, it just makes you sit and appreciate in awe. Every character is portrayed as if we've been living with them for years, just that they're now on screen instead of being with us. A sign of a good movie is that it lasts, a sign of an excellent movie is that it lasts longer, while a sign for a movie like this is that it'll embed itself in your mind and heart for a long long time to come, and you'll cherish every moment remembering it. Shichinin no samurai (1954)"
sandnair87,"Feb 9, 2016",9/10,"Akira Kurosawa's jidai-geki epic 'Seven Samurai' can be counted among the greatest of all battle movies - a majestic tale of heroism, sacrifice and death, that remains unmatched, even today. Set in 1587, it follows the story of a village of farmers that hire seven master-less samurai to combat bandits who will return after the harvest to steal their crops. The displaced samurai - seven sword-swinging, bow-and-arrow footmen of varied courage and personality - put aside class differences in order to defend the village that has been the unfortunate target of the gang of marauding bandits for a long time.The first half where the lead samurai gathers his troops and journeys to the village, is fascinating, full of vigor and life. But the second half - where the samurai train the peasant villagers to fight and then take on the bandit horde, resisting wave after wave of horseback assaults with sword and rifle in the driving rain, the bandits battering against the improvised fortifications, trading deaths until the last rifle shot and sword-slash - is one of the most thrilling sustained passages of action cinema ever.On that simple framework and familiar storyline, director Akira Kurosawa plasters a wealth of rich detail, which brilliantly illuminates his characters and the kind of action in which they are involved. We feel the warfare so intensely because of his mastery of staging and editing the violence. But we also feel the film because the characters are so strong, especially the seven samurai themselves: heroes in the truest sense, but also convincingly idiosyncratic and human. The film's three and a half hour length is more than justified by the intricate character development of both the samurai and the villagers, as both groups let go of class biases to accomplish their mutual goal of fortifying the village. The legendary Takashi Shimura as the ageing, and oddly charismatic leader and Toshirô Mifune as the arrogant ronin looking to outdo his compatriots lead a superb cast, and Kurosawa's kinetic camera keeps the adventure sizzling with energy and wit from start to finish. By the climactic showdowns against the bandits, a palpable anxiety is present due to the great affinity the audience feels for the characters.Rich in detail, vivid in characterization and leisurely in exposition, Seven Samurai is bravura filmmaking. Akira Kurosawa synthesizes the traditions of the samurai narrative and the American western to create an intimate epic with deeply felt ground-level consequences. While doing so, he deflates the myth of the noble samurai without actually debunking it and sends a dark thrill through his audience with a touch of sensuous physical reality."
sme_no_densetsu,"Feb 19, 2012",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa's ""Seven Samurai"" is generally regarded as one of the crown jewels of world cinema. This epic (3½ hour) film tells the story of a group of samurai recruited by poor farmers in order to defend their village against a group of bandits. Seven accept the challenge, despite the promise of hard times and little reward.Despite being over three hours in length, there isn't a wasted moment in the film. We're introduced to the bandit threat in the opening scene and the buildup to their return is filled with character development. By the time the conflict starts resulting in casualties, we've grown attached to these characters and hate to see them go. And once the real action finally does start, it's unrelenting.The cast is well assembled and includes Japanese film legends Toshirô Mifune & Takashi Shimura. While I found Mifune's portrayal of the brash Kikuchiyo to be a bit over-the-top there's no denying that he has tremendous screen presence. Shimura's performance is much more subdued as he provides an ideal personification of samurai values. Other standouts include Seiji Miyaguchi as master swordsman Kyûzô, Yoshio Tsuchiya as defiant villager Rikichi and Isao Kimura as the young and inexperienced Katsushirô.The direction by Kurosawa is uniformly well handled whether in the heat of battle or in a more peaceful moment (though I can't say I cared for his use of slow motion). The film also boasts some nice cinematography which makes the most of costumes & sets that convincingly establish the period setting. Meanwhile, the music of Fumio Hayasaka sets the right tone throughout.In the end, I would have rated this movie a bit higher except that I grew up with the Western remake ""The Magnificent Seven"" and it remains one of my absolute favourite movies of all time. So, for me at least, while the original is a top notch movie, I can't help but compare it to the slightly superior (in my mind) remake. Of course, this preference may or may not be completely objective."
Speechless,"Sep 22, 1999",N/A,"As a child of late-20th Century cinema, I am unfortunately cursed with a terribly short attention span.  As such, I didn't enjoy this 200-minute classic as much as I would have liked, because it totally exceeded the amount of time I can bring myself to spend with a movie.  This is, of course, through no fault of Kurosawa or his brilliant cast and crew. I've not seen the cut-down 140-minute version, but the thought of shortening this film horrifies me because everything here is so vitally important and tremendously beautiful.  To remove a minute of ""Seven Samurai"" is to destroy dozens of those cool little film techniques and acting nuances that separate the wonderful films from the merely good.  I personally just have to watch it one tape at a time..."
maitreg,"Mar 16, 2001",7/10,"Very long.  They could have cut out about 1.5 hours and the movie would have been just as effective.  It is an excellent portrayal of the harshness the Japanese people lived through for centuries.  This movie teaches lots of lessons, the most important being how strong a family and village bond can be.The entire country is in the middle of an economic catastrophe.  A small rice-farming village is constantly attacked by bandits who steal all their food and leave them to die.  In a final effort to save their village and their lives, they seek out samurai to protect them.  When they convince a samurai that their cause is worth fighting for, he assembles a team of warriors to plan a defense for the town against the bandits.Another DVD that seriously needs English dubbing.  Sub-titles give me headaches, especially when they go on for over three hours.  Great film though, even if you have to watch it over three sittings."
StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 3, 2005",10/10,Considered one of the greatest films ever made The Seven Samurai is Akira Kurasawa's 16th century samurai epic. Shimada (Takashi Shimura) is an experienced samurai who is approached by a group of peasant farmers and asked to protect them from bandits who continue to attack and steal their food. Shimada is honorable and sees their need and he also needs to know where his next meal will come from so he agrees. He knows he can't go up against the bandits alone so he recruits five real samurai to help him. Crazy Kikuchiyo (Toshirô Mifune) insists on tagging along even though he doesn't seem to be a real samurai. Shimada and his group of warriors train the villagers in the art of self defense and they are housed and fed. The film ends with an astounding battle when the village is attacked by the horde of bandits. The Seven Samurai is a long movie with subtitles and needs to be seen multiple times to get the most out of it. It's not an easy movie but it's an unforgettably moving experience. The American western version was The Magnificent Seven.
jameslinton-75252,"Apr 18, 2016",6/10,"For what it is, this film is good, but is also bloated and over-long. Films that are three and a half hours long have to be engaging throughout and this film just wasn't. My interest really wandered at times and I was impatiently wanting for this film to end. I think I only survived it by watching it in two different halves.Perhaps I'm being unfair. Apart from its unnecessary length, Seven Samurai is a powerful film about a group of villagers who are attacked my bandits and call on the protection of Seven Samurai.

ikiru71-220-566499,"Aug 29, 2013",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa directed 31 films during his career. That is a impressive number for any director, but it is even more impressive when you consider how many of theses are truly great films. Because of this choosing the greatest Kurosawa film is no easy task. I've always been partial to ""Ikiru"" as my favorite Kurosawa film, but ""Seven Samurai"" is a close second. For those not aware the basic premise of the film is a group of seven samurai are recruited to help defend a poor farming village from invading bandits. That may sound like a simple plot, but this film is far from that. The film is a complex and rich story told in three acts. The first is the recruiting of the samurai, the second is the preparation for battle, and the third is the battle. At over 3 hours long one would think this would be a boring film, but it isn't. The film is excellently paced and never drags. This is due to the great story, well-developed characters, wonderful performances, great action scenes, and, of course, Kurosawa's fantastic direction.One example of Kurosawa's great direction in this movie is his use of ""deep focus"". These are shots where he chooses to compose it in order to get many subjects in the frame and in focus at the same time. By doing this he gives us a better sense of what is going on. In some of the shots we can see how every character is reacting to a situation at the same time, without cutting back and forth between them. In other shots he gives us a sense of characters and how they relate to their surroundings.He uses this extensively in the second act to help establish the layout of the town. So, by the third act, we have a thorough understanding of how and where the action is taking place. Even during the action Kurosawa uses these wider shots to show us what is happening and put things in perspective. He uses camera movement and composition to emphasize the action, instead of rapidly cutting between shots. Some modern directors would do well to take note of this technique.Watching ""Seven Samurai"" one might feel that many of the scenes are familiar. That's partly because the film was remade into ""The Magnificent Seven"" in 1960 but it also because this film has inspired countless similar action films since its first release. The recruiting scenes, the training scenes, and the fight scenes have been duplicated in many ways. There is even a scene toward the beginning of the film in which one of the lead characters shows his intelligence and talent by defeating a villain completely unrelated to the main plot. It's a nice character establishing scene that is ubiquitous in modern day action films. Kurosawa has been listed as an primary influence by great directors such as Francis Ford Coppola, Steven Spielberg, and Martin Scorsese. Watching ""Seven Samurai"" it is easy to see why he is such an influence. It is a true classic and one of the great masterpieces of the cinema."
drqshadow-reviews,"Jun 25, 2020",8/10,"A frantic farming community, having overheard local marauders' plans for a post-harvest raid, hires a band of masterless samurai for protection. As strategies are hatched and strongholds fortified, we get to know both villagers and warriors on a close, personal level, uncovering their stories as the seasons change and invasion grows imminent.Legend has it that Kurosawa went far above and beyond in fleshing out this cast, composing detailed family trees and personality profiles for each of the hundred-plus roles to help his actors (even the extras) get under their characters' skin. That level of crazy hyper-focus is indicative of the whole production, which vastly overstepped its budget and shot for nearly four times longer than originally scheduled, but the results can't be denied.Seven Samurai is a justifiably revered classic, a prototype for the modern action movie (not to mention a roadmap for the entire western genre), and a rich portrait of a very specific time and cultural relationship in Japanese history. It may linger too long - there's definitely still some fat on the bone in the two-hundred minute theatrical cut - but the extra quiet time with important characters pays off in the dramatic, joltingly conclusive, final conflict."
fa-oy,"Sep 13, 2011",10/10,"Kurosawa is one of my favorite directors, I can always watch one of his films knowing that it won't disappoint me. If you ask anyone about Kurosawa's best film, they'll probably tell you Seven Samurai is his masterpiece. Although it is true that it is indeed a masterpiece, it's not my favorite film from him.The first time I watched this film, I didn't like it, due to its length. It would take more viewings to really appreciate its greatness. So when I read reviews complaining about its length, I understand them. I encourage everyone, though (mostly to those who found it boring because of its length), not to give up on this film, it really requires more viewings. And if you don't like it, there's nothing wrong with it, after all, you just can't like everything.This film can be divided into three parts:1- The search for the seven samuraiThe villagers, being oppressed by bandits, decide to stand up and fight this time against them, so they go in search for samurai to help them in that task. This is my favorite part of the film, the recruitment of the seven samurai is one of the best things I've seen in a movie.2.- The preparation for battle (against the bandits)The villagers, with the help of the seven samurai, start their preparation to defend their village and fight against the bandits. This part is also outstanding, the defense planning of the village is something to behold.3.- The BattleThe Bandits finally decide to attack the village, the great battle between the villagers and bandits takes place. The battle sequences are really impressive here, the astonishing Kurosawa's camera-work allows you to behold the battle without missing a thing; you can see everything that's happening in the battlefield (mostly when the bandits enter inside the village).I know I didn't get into much plot detail, but I just needed to review this movie and let everybody know that they may not appreciate this film in the first viewing, although there are many that liked it in the first one."
shanejcoulter,"Jun 1, 2012",10/10,"i am disappointed to see that Seven Samurai has dropped slightly on the top 250 list, as it is without a doubt my favorite film of all time. Akira Kurosawa's epic tale about bravery and honor is three and a half hours in length, but i assure you, not a single second of this film is wasted. Kurosawa spends 2 and a half hours developing his characters in a way that in unrivaled by any other film. He develops and intense mob mentality of fear and selfishness in the peasants, that he masterfully contrasts with the brave, self sacrificing actions of the Seven Samurai. And so, after over 150 minutes of careful character development, Kurosawa ends the film with a one hour battle scene, that is not defined by intense action sequences, but by acts of valor and sacrifice, that truly bring the characters full circle. I strongly recommend this film, and i hope that the ""black and white"" barrier that plagues most movie goers would not stop them from watching this movie. It is truly a wonder to behold."
Tweetienator,"Nov 23, 2019",10/10,"This is one of my black and white alltime classics that I still like to watch from time to time. If you never watched a samurai movie and you would ask me for a recommandation I still would say this is the one you should watch. Superior in every aspect to the Hollywood samurai movies - acting, directing etc. Everything in this movie is top notch, sometimes to watch is like to meditate. Shichinin no samurai aka Seven Samurai is one of Akira Kurosawa's best (he got a lot more) and one of those movies that will stand the test of time for all eternity.Other movies I would recommend (directed by the master himself): Yôjinbô. Rashômon. Tsubaki Sanjûrô. And of course you could watch those Hollywood movies based on Kurasawa's work like Last Man Standing (1996), A Fistful of Dollars (1964), The Magnificent Seven (I prefer the 1960s version to the new one)."
joelius-2,"Feb 8, 2000",N/A,"I have to admit that I was just a tad disappointed by ""Seven Samurai"". (I love these people who call it ""Shichinin no samurai"" in their comments, but otherwise write in English.)  I felt that the battle sequences were just not that convincing or stirring.  Obviously Kurosawa did not have the kind of resources that the makers of, say, ""Braveheart"" had when they filmed their battles.  Is it unfair to compare a 1954 film with a newer film in this area?I guess my question is, with what state of mind does one sit down to watch a film like ""Seven Samurai""?  Are you self-consciously regarding it as a Classic, much as one would regard an artifact in a museum, studying the methods of those who made it, considering its historical context, and tracing in your mind its influence on later works?  By this standard, ""Seven Samurai"" is clearly a ""great"" movie.  But I have my doubts about this standard.This method has its uses, especially for critics and historians.  But I would like art to work on a more immediate level.  The kind of critical distance I describe above removes you from the thing itself, and art should involve you absolutely, without those layers of conscious consideration. I think on that level ""Seven Samurai"", through no fault of its own, is no longer as effective as it (probably) once was.I'd like to hear what other people think about this issue, how to think about old ""classic"" movies.  Can anyone simply watch ""Citizen Kane"" without thinking ""I am watching the 'greatest movie ever made'""?  And if you bring that kind of baggage into the theater with you, can you ever really make your own critical judgment about the movie?  Can you ever decide for yourself whether or not ""Citizen Kane"" is great art?  Will you be allowed to?Okay, I'm moved quite far from ""Seven Samurai"".  The movie was good, but its unconvincing action sequences made it less effective and involving."

A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Sep 12, 2018",10/10,"My Rating : 10/10 ♠ MASTERPIECE ♠I have viewed a number of Japanese movies because of the high regard they have in the world of international cinema. Akira Kurosawa is right at the top of Japanese auteurs and Seven Samurai is one of the best of the best.It is a long movie and that makes it difficult to watch in one go and therefore I suggest to break it up into 2 or 3 parts as that's how I managed to finish it. Yes, it can be a bit slow sometimes but more often than not there's something interesting happening to keep you engaged.Seven Samurai is the blueprint Samurai movie and has been adapted in various forms in all of world cinema. However, I believe this movie would hardly have fared as well if not for Toshiro Mifune's character of the drunk, over the top samurai.An interesting fact about this is that according to actor Toshiro Mifune, the film was originally going to be called Six Samurai, with Mifune playing the role of Kyuzo. During the six-week scriptwriting process, Kurosawa and his screenwriters realized that ""six sober samurai were a bore-they needed a character that was more off-the-wall"". Kurosawa recast Mifune as Kikuchiyo and gave him creative license to improvise actions in his performance.Do watch if given the chance. The battle scenes are simply a treat to watch and a lot of films owe their success to Seven Samurai."
Nothinggrandproductions,"Oct 27, 2013",7/10,"Seven Samurai is a massive, ambitious and influential film that made many common plot elements today what they are. But, does that mean it's actually a great film? In my opinion, no, not so much. A decent one and an important one that everyone should watch but not necessarily a great one. The movie is long. Much too long in my opinion. It's three hours and twenty minutes about, and never does that time seem totally worth it. The characters aren't very compelling which makes me have trouble with actually getting attached to the story itself even if it is interesting. None of the characters for the most part go beyond a surface level of character development which leads me to not caring about a whole lot that is going on. That's not to say the movie is awful.The movie is ambitious and is incredible especially for it's release date, I'm sure almost nothing of it's kind existed beforehand. The movie is massive as I stated before and is filled with many action set pieces that still hold up fairly well today. It is a period piece as well, taking place in 1587 in the Warring States Period of Japan and seems to do a good job portraying samurai which are pretty much cool and interesting by default but that doesn't mean the characters themselves are good. A village of farmers goes to hire samurai to protect them from bandits, they hire a total of seven, if it wasn't obvious enough for the title. The plot is interesting and compelling but again, it doesn't really matter.I don't care about the people in the movie, at least for the most part. And that remains to be my biggest issue. A movie like this needs characters that I at least sort of care about. Probably one of my biggest comparisons to this movie is The Thin Red Line, a Terrence Malick movie which I really like Terrence Malick for the most part. It's a war movie that barely focuses on the characters so I don't really care about anything that is going on. I felt pretty much the same during this movie. Overall, Seven Samurai is still a very important film and a mildly interesting one but that doesn't mean it needs to be held as one of the greatest films of all time like it is, because frankly, it doesn't hold up as well as everyone thinks."
ravarlese,"Mar 7, 2016",1/10,"I needed to rate this one star to do my part in lowering the level. There is no way this is top 20 material. I understand where this movie belongs in film history. However, Citizen Kane is not in the top 20, and if that doesn't make it for historical significance, then nothing should. Let the movie stand for itself on all levels not it's impact on filmmaking. The movie is epic, in length. At just about thee and a half hours long with what I am sure is amazing Japanese dialogue but the subtitled translations are not very compelling.

FilmSnobby,"Nov 28, 2003",9/10,"Given carte blanche after the worldwide successes of  *Rashomon*  and *Ikiru*, Akira Kurosawa embarked on creating what amounted to a new national epic -- *Seven Samurai*.  In the process, he changed movies forever.You know the story even if you've never seen the movie:  the citizens of a rural village, weary of being harassed by a local gang of bandits, recruit a rag-tag group of seven samurai warriors to help defend their homes.  The only pay the farmers can offer to the samurai is three squares a day.  Just the right inducement for these adventurers, led by Takashi Shimura as the wise leader, and Kurosawa regular Toshiro Mifune as a wanna-be samurai whose antecedents were farmers.The story doesn't amount to much, but Kurosawa more than compensates for this lack of complexity by creating about 10 interesting characters and by setting a whole new standard for action scenes in the cinema.  Therefore, the 3.5-hour length of the movie certainly isn't a handicap, unless good drama and well-choreographed action are too much for your CGI-conditioned brain.Which brings me to a point:  I tend to read a dozen or so IMDb reviews of a film before I add my own comments for this website, and I did so with *Seven Samurai*.  It was rather disheartening to keep reading, over and over, even from those who LIKED the movie, that it's  ""pretty good for a black & white movie"".  Or, ""pretty good for an old movie"".  Or, ""pretty good for a foreign movie"".  Uh, yeah.  *Seven Samurai*  is pretty good, OK?  Even if it's an old, black & white foreign movie.  What's with the xenophobia and the complete lack of appreciation for film history?  I'm glad that everyone has found this masterpiece  ""good enough""  for today's standards, but in the meantime let me offer a tip:  it's the recent, Hollywood movies -- in color -- that tend to suck.  OK?  *Seven Samurai*  needs no apologies for being black & white, Japanese, and old."
KFL,"Nov 28, 1999",10/10,"The Seven Samurai shows us the unvarnished facts of life about people in desperate straits...in this case, the relations between samurai and peasants in 16th-century Japan. Nothing is prettified (in the moral/social sense...several scenes are quite beautiful though), and the grim situation of people fighting for their lives and livelihoods is as gripping as I've ever seen in a movie.It's a long movie, but seldom boring...there are excitement, humor, drama in turn. The plot is coherent, the visuals excellent. A superb movie in every way.10/10"
EijnarAmadeus,"May 19, 2008",9/10,"SEVEN SAMURAI is a requested view; this is the movie where Hollywood got one-upped by Akira Kurosawa, a Japenese director who had earned himself international respect after 1950's Rashomon. The movie tells the story of a village under attack by merciless bandits, in despair they hire seven samurais to protect them - its a classic plot, but never before 1954 had any Western movie appeared with an ensemble of heroes, and at well three hours' runtime it has time to tell rich characterizations. The film speaks to the defeated people of 1954, who regarded the Americans as much as the villagers regards both the bandits and the super-powered samurais. And the action scenes changed the ways of cinema, before Sam Peckinpah he uses slow-motion and before Sergio Leone he remembers the importance of of establishing a character's place within the frame before a fight. A Must-See in cinema history."
LoneWolfAndCub,"Jul 15, 2006",10/10,"Shichinin no samurai (Seven Samurai) is probably Akira Kurosawa's most loved movie. Shichinin no samurai is also my first Akira Kurosawa movie. After hearing so much about it I went out and rented the original full length version. Not once did I get bored. Although it takes 30 minutes to be introduced the first samurai, it's not boring. The fighting doesn't even happen until near the end of the movie. But not once was I bored.A village is being terrorised by a group of bandits. A villager overhears when the bandits will attack next. So three of the villagers go out in search of a samurai that will help protect them. This samurai feels pity for them and answers their call. He gathers another six samurai to help defend the village and train the villagers.This movie helped inspire an entire genre, the Western. Where do you think The Magnificent Seven came from?? Akira Kurosawa is a brilliant storyteller. This story unfolds beautifully and at a steady pace. The characters are all developed so that we care for them all. This movie a bit of everything. It has bits of humour, it has drama and it has plenty of action. The battle scenes are engaging and at times suspenseful. This movie is recommended for everyone, as it is a brilliant piece of cinema.5/5."
d-thatcher,"Apr 24, 2004",10/10,"I am just commenting on my insights. The director of this movie Akira Kurosawa, and this movie in particular, influenced George Lucas to create the Star Wars movies. It has also been the basis for The Magnificent Seven, Return of the Magnificent Seven, Guns of the Magnificent Seven, The Magnificent Seven television series, Battle Beyond the Stars, A Bug's Life, The 13th Warrior, Shane, Pale Rider, High Noon, The Road Warrior, Galaxy Quest, Woman in the Dunes, Yojimbo, and many others. It is a movie of courage and the power of temptation. It is not so much about the samurai coming to the aid of a community as it is of human nature within a small group of law men. In reality, it can serve as an example to military and officers of the law, that they can be corrupted, but that if they can stand above reproach, the rewards are the in the means themselves."
halmt,"Feb 14, 2023",10/10,"I go back and forth wondering if, in fact, this is the best movie of all time. Each time I rewatch it, all doubts are erased, though sometimes it takes a few days for it to sink in that this film is something special. Deep character development, carved by a superb cast led by Takashi Shimura and Toshiro Mifune, keeps this epic marathon moving along, and engrossing. I'm sure we can all think of several American made films that qualify as the ""best ever,"" but in the end, don't overlook this one. Directed by Japanese master Akira Kurosawa, I highly recommend this film for movie lovers in general and film buffs in particular."
stryker-5,"Feb 7, 1999",N/A,"Japan in the 1500's is a land of hunger and lawlessness.  The great warrior caste, the samurai, is reduced to a vagabond life of poverty. Landless and workless, the samurai are resented wherever they wander.  Gangs of bandits terrorise the countryside and the poor farmers, whose existence is already wretched, are continually robbed of their food - until one village decides to fight back.  The farmers hire seven samurai to help them resist the outlaws.Bandits ride in over the horizon like a black storm-cloud.  After the village has been ravaged, the farmers wail and lament in the little square. Rapid cuts emphasise the plurality of the farmers as a mass of individuals, and also their oneness in suffering.  Rikichi argues passionately for resisting the bandits, and sits glowering in the foreground as others counsel capitulation.  We feel that Rikichi will win the argument.So the farmers send a deputation to town to recruit a few samurai.  We share the farmers' awe as they watch the fierce, proud fighting-men walk through the streets.  As the days pass and the farmers run low on food, they finally manage to enlist their seven samurai.Kambei is the samurai leader.  This tough veteran's fighting spirit is tempered by wisdom and human decency.  His old friend Gorobei is his stalwart second-in-command.  A youngster who is not yet a full samurai, Katsushiro, joins the group and Kambei treats him like a son.  Shijiroji and Heibachi are good-natured, cheerful warriors whom Kambei is delighted to recruit.  Kyuzo is the model samurai - absolutely brave, proficient, superbly fit and unrelenting, and possessed of a calm inner strength.  The seventh member is Kikuchiyo, the eccentric misfit who haunts the margins of the group but ultimately earns pride of place in the ranks of the samurai.How the farmers get to enlist Kambei is an excellent story in itself. A crazed thief is holding a child hostage, and Kambei poses as a monk, storms the house and rescues the child.  We get to see Kambei in action, and marvel at his courage and tactical skill.  His head is shaved for the monk role, and he spends the rest of the movie rubbing his scalp in an endearing little mannerism.The farmers have no money to pay the samurai.  They will feed their guests with rice, and eat millet themselves.  Though they are giving next to nothing, they are giving all they have. Kambei enjoys the sheer fun of the fight, and as he starts to interest himself in the village's defensive dispositions we know that he is being drawn into the project.  The farmers' rice jar is plundered, and Yohei despairingly gathers spilt grains from the floor.  Katsushiro drops a few coins into the rice, so the farmers will not go hungry.  It is a symbol of the beneficent intervention of the samurai in the farmers' unhappy lives.Kikuchiyo is introduced to the viewer by being given a prominent place in Kambei's preparations to fight the thief.  Kikuchiyo's restless quirkiness, and his positioning in the foreground, allow his personality to creep into our awareness.We meet Kyuzo in a totally different way.  He wins a mock-fight in the town square, using bamboo sticks in place of swords.  His opponent is unwilling to accept defeat and rather than lose face in front of the onlookers insists on a swordfight.  Kyuzo's inner calm and beautiful sword artistry point to one outcome.  And the inevitable happens.The film is the story of how the samurai train and prepare the farmers to meet the bandits' onslaught, and what happens when the bandits finally attack.  The actions scenes are splendid, coming at the climax of a long, utterly absorbing build-up.Kambei and his samurai are steeped in the teachings of Sun Tzu, the ancient Chinese philosopher of warcraft.  ""Collective defence protects the individual,"" insists Kambei, and it is the villagers' willingness to be the components in his war machine that wins the day.  This collective effort also expresses something profound about Japanese culture and the deeply-embedded belief in teamwork over individuality.  A beaten opponent begging for mercy should not be killed, according to Sun Tzu, but Kambei concedes that the farmers are entitled to their revenge.  The samurai do not participate in the butchery.Gathering the harvest provides a happy respite from barricade-building. The joyful oneness with nature's fecundity prompts thoughts of coupling. Katsushiro and Shino fall in love.  Rikichi's pain intensifies as the season of plenty returns, and during the raid on the bandits' camp we are shocked to learn why.  Kikiuchiyo undergoes a cathartic confrontation with his own past in the shadow of the burning watermill.In the closing moments of the film, the farmers set to planting the new rice crop, the symbol of returning hope, to the accompaniment of flute and drums.  The beat is the rhythm of life itself, and it fills the surviving samurai with melancholy. Earlier in the film, Kambei observed that ""I've got nothing out of fighting. I am alone in the world.""  Now, as the young women of the village carry richly-laden yokes past him, Kambei looks in a different direction, up to the samurai graves on the skyline.  He cannot escape the feeling that the farmers have won and the fighting-men, lonely and rootless as before, have somehow lost.Verdict - a film of monumental power and intelligence."
sc8031,"Jun 16, 2008",10/10,"Those of you who haven't seen this movie yet, you're the peasants. You people who don't like this movie, you're the bandits.No bones about it, here we have quite possibly the most complete film experience ever, the fat all boiled and trimmed. Every shot, movement, character and event has resounding significance within the whole piece.Watch the newest Criterion release and listen to the different commentary tracks after you watch the movie. The box set is totally gorgeous and comes with Kurosawa interviews.You people who are saying you didn't find my comment useful, you're the samurai who gets killed in the duel with the master swordsman in the beginning. A hahaha!"
mardalsfossen01,"Jan 3, 2020",7/10,Don't expect any spectacular Samurai sword techniques being displayed. It's a black/white 3 hours long japanese movie with quite a few memorable characters and a lot of talking (at times funny) and battling. There's only two main settings - a village and a small town. Good for it's time and a japanese classic. Although I don't think they got the most out of it - There's still some parts making me come up with a better way to present it.
trminator-35198,"Aug 20, 2020",5/10,This movie did not need to be 3 hrs long. The story could have been done just as easily in 1:30. The high notes of this film are its age and the amount of enviornment control. The directors did a great job at bending the mostly outdoor setting to their every desire.
zetes,"Apr 8, 2000",9/10,"Watching this film for over 3 hours, I felt excited every step of the way. I thought the situation was interesting, the characters were interesting, the acting was spectacular, and the action to be very intelligently crafted. But I felt there were some small problems, as well. The characters' names were rarely spoken, so it became easier to mix some of the characters up as the film progressed. Especially, I thought two of the samurai looked very like each other (and the person with whom I was watching this film had the same problem, so it's not just me).Also, I don't think this film belongs within the top ten of anyone's list. It is very well directed and executed, but it has no profundity. After I was done watching it, I put it away, went to my room, and thought very little about it. A great film leads to pondering. I think Kurosawa's _Rashomon_ and, even moreso, _Ran_ contained a lot more depth. Also, Japan has produced many, many very thoughtful and powerful animated films such as _Princess Mononoke_ and _Grave of the Fireflies_. _The Seven Samurai_ is a great film, but I would hesitate to call it a masterpiece."
manendra-lodhi,"Oct 13, 2012",10/10,"The film with its huge length shows each and every aspect beautifully. The story is about a village which is living under the fear of the bandits. They hire a group of samurai's to protect them from further raids. One might think a lot before starting the film considering its length but I assure you that it is worth the time. The way that they portrayed each character is extremely commendable.PROS:The film is a blend of everything. It has comedy, courage, difficult times in life, war strategy and many more. The cinematography is good and without flaw. The film gives a view that whole of the village was engaged in the war. Everyone seemed to be working all the times. The story is not as engaging since we know the end, but slowly as the film progresses, we just tend to be with the rhythm that the director has created for the viewer.MESSAGE: ""Fight for what is JUST.""VERDICT: ""Most recommended."""
c_hawks_fan,"May 26, 2006",10/10,"Look at any listing of top 10 movies of all time and you are most likely to see Akira Kurasawa's Shichinin No Samurai (Seven Samurai). It has spawned countless imitators and homages. His uses of both style and substance gives you a ""movie you can eat"". Though not his favourite film it is one of his most successful and certainly his most well known.Seven Samurai has so many of what have now become clichéd movie techniques, it's hard to believe that this one movie is almost the first to use them. Slo-motion, the use of the horizon line, cutting on movement and even pointing the camera at the sun. His use of the tele-photo lens along with two other cameras simultaneously has become famous, along with filming the shots cutting 180 degrees. These techniques have been emulated by many directors most notably Steven Spielberg and George Lucas just to name a few.The story itself is also compelling. Told from the point of view of the samurai, we first see the villagers a lowly creatures. Kikuchiyo, played masterfully by the brilliant Toshiro Mifune, Is the go-between that shows us that all is not as it seems. Co-written by Kurasawa the story is the ""lets join together for a common goal"" piece. It does not however do this ham-handed. Once you have an understanding of the Japanese culture you can truly see the richness of all the characters that are involved in the film.Even at over three hours long it still moves like the wind, yet lets you catch your breath at all the right moments. Poignant, funny, stark and most of all entertaining this is not only A great movie, but one that rewards repeated viewing. This is not just a movie, it's a work of art."
runkelcorey,"Jul 10, 2012",10/10,"Coming in at over three hours, and being set in 1500s feudal Japan, Seven Samurai is a true historical epic. It may not have gone many exotic places, much of it in one tiny village, but hey, neither did Titanic. But it's epic status is not what sets it apart from the rest; no, rather is its dramatic storyline and subplots, as well as very likable leads. Kurosawa's script (also a writer here) doesn't play this up as a period piece, thankfully refraining from anachronisms, and it says fresh in 2012 (although it was probably re-subtitled with the DVD release a few years ago). It also shows the Japanese humor that Kurosawa eagerly portrays in some scenes--genuinely funny, I might add--even if not full on comedy quality (it is a drama after all).After the opening credits, which features great drum based music, showcasing Japanese culture and the action element of Seven Samurai, we see a group of bandits about to pillage a village positioned in a basin with sides made of mountains, frequently demanding that the villagers pay them to keep them safe. A farmer from this small farming town overhears their conversation to come back when the harvest is over. A leader from the village suggests hiring samurai to protect them, ones that will take rice and shelter as compensation. So we see a down-on-his-luck veteran-samurai negotiating and freeing a child from harm, and a representative from the village asks for help. After much persuading the samurai accepts, but says the job will require at least seven. Next, we track down four more, a good natured one that is often the source of comic relief, and a master swordsman, who's quiet, yet well spoken, with philosophical lines. A villager is accepted to the brotherhood. Finally, a clown of a man, seldom not drunk at the beginning, who begs to come along, and they reluctantly accept.After this rich exposition, the committee tasked with finding the samurai return victorious, and you next expect a great celebration, possibly even a feast (this is a town where the villagers seldom eat rice out of season, only millet). Much to the chagrin of the seven, there is no outpouring, not even people in the streets. The men with daughters and/or wives, are protecting them from who they think are going to rape them. The rest are simply afraid. So the wild card, the fool among masters, sounds the alarm bells in the village square. After all the peoples fear the worst and come out to defend themselves, the samurai delivers a wonderfully pointed speech about how they did not come to be feared and hated by the townspeople, but to provide a great service for below minimal payment scolding them for indecency and generalizations, and more than anything, whining about it, too.The next half hour or so, is showing the village and collected samurai readying for defense (traps, positioning, and the like), and teaching the villagers how to defend themselves with a sword or spear. And a lovely romance too scandalous for public approval, this is the only part that would gain a significant amount if in color. The picturesque setting with its wonderful fall setting, with leaves on the ground, a small stream and presumed cherry blossoms for this great love story: Technicolor would have just made your heart sing.But of all the things in this movie that are good, nothing beats the last hour, an all out battle: bandits versus the magnificent seven (yes, this is where that came from). I can't overstate it enough, of all the movies I've seen with battles or even wars in it, nothing, not even the brilliant western shootouts from The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, can top this, not one second could be beaten by almost any other fights in the history of cinema. You may not like the long, suspense and plot building drama that precedes it, but no one can deny the masterpiece that is this battle. As a stand-alone movie, it would still be pretty good (and probably not too short, either).Long movie short, Akira Kurosawa's rich character development and perennially likable personalities (it seems as though a different person wrote each part, they're really that built up), along with what is the all time greatest battle I've ever seen, easily and gracefully earns Shichinin no samurai a high place in anyone's movie collection. http://woltzpictures.wordpress.com/"
bob the moo,"Jul 21, 2008",N/A,"A village is plagued by bandits who regularly and clear them out of their crops, leaving them with little to live on. The majority of the village almost seems to accept this as their lot in life but one young man decides enough is enough and tries to organise some way of fighting back. He learns from one of the elders of a village that hired wandering samurai many years ago and were the only village to survive the bandit raids. Sure this is the way forward he heads out with a group to employ the services of samurai before the bandits return next year. However the samurai are a proud breed and can they really find some that will be willing to work for food in return for risking their lives?In an attempt to ensure I do not become someone who only watches new releases on DVD etc, I decided to use LoveFilm to venture into more of the ""classics"" territory and specifically to close the gap that is Akira Kurosawa. I noticed in a couple of reviews that I had referred to Seven Samurai as a ""classic"" and suggested it was better than the films I was reviewing but yet, on reflection, I'd never actually seen it  hence me getting this version (not aware that it was nearly three hours long). I needn't have worried though because the time went very quickly indeed and I found myself engaged in the story. It mixes action with humour, drama, pathos all within a superficially simple but effective narrative. What I think the problem is when it comes to modern viewings of the film is that we have this collective accepted wisdom that this film is ""brilliant"" and this I think is in us from birth  preventing us coming to the film on its own terms.It didn't offer me anything that amazed me or made me mark it down as a classic but this didn't bother me while watching it because I was enjoying it and the thoughts of ""is this a classic"" were not in me. Reading others' comments after watching it though I can see that for some it was and that some watched waiting for ""brilliance"" to happen instead of watching the film for themselves. Having said that though, don't take me as saying that this is not any good because, although not all I had assumed, it is still very good. Kurosawa has written a very good script that keeps the contrasting aspects working well together and not feeling disjointed in the delivery, mainly by having the characters be natural and interesting in their design. As director he works with cinematographer Nakai to make the film look very good  particularly in the heavy mud and rain of the final battle, where the images remain fluid and sharp. He also draws good performances from his cast and in particular Shimura who is a sturdy rock at the core of the group. Mifune gets attention and provides energy with his character while of the rest of the samurai I liked the performances from Miyaguchi, Kimura and Kato.I can understand why some have been a bit down on this film because in some ways it cannot live up to the accepted opinion that we all seem to hold that it is brilliant. However this is not to do down the film because it is still very good  it just helps to meet it on its terms rather than expect it to bend to meet yours. Really well filmed and acted, the simple story mixes humour, action and drama in an effective blend that will see the running time of near three hours move by pretty quickly."
rohanfell,"Nov 18, 2013",10/10,"""Seven Samurai"" is an immortal gem in cinema history which sets the standards of masterful filmmaking. It features stupendous performances, specially from Toshiru Mifune. It holds you like a magnet from the first frame to the last. I have never seen such a well-crafted movie with exemplary direction. Kurosawa was a cinematic titan who also made many masterpieces like Yojimbo, Ran, Red Beard, Throne of Blood, High and Low and much more. His work is unparalleled for he infused so much finesse and craftsmanship in his films that they inspire me every time I watch them.Very few directors can match his ability and is still counted among legends such as Ozu, Hitchcock, Fellini, Antonioni, Ford, Welles etc.He will always be an inspiration for aspiring directors who want to make quality cinema and not the trash-can, garbage films of today."
KiltsMcGee,"May 17, 2015",7/10,"You want Samurai? We've got seven of them and they're all recognisable and nuanced in their own memorable way. As a side-note, I literally just looked up what the plural of the word Samurai was because I just wasn't sure. The embarrassing thing is that I really should have been sure considering I spent three and a half hours watching a film whose title has the pluralised form of Samurai displayed for the world to see. Clearly, I am not an observant person.I am not opposed to films being long as long as all the scenes within them at least seem necessary to the plot and characters. When your film has a black screen that says, 'INTERMISSION' on it, it's safe to say that you are pushing it a little. With a run time of 206 minutes Kurosawa's epic lives up to that weighty noun. While I could criticise it for being over-bloated, almost all the scenes were necessary to making the film what it is.The film has three long phases. The first phase is the formation of the titular Samurai boy band of death in their quest to protect a village of farmers from a barrage of bandits. Each of the characters has ample screen time devoted to them (which considering the amount of time available to assign). They are all full to brim with character; an important trait when considering the film is pre-colour. With the power to use colour to immediately recognise the characters stolen from the film, it is forced to use physical mannerisms to show which character is which at a glance that and silly hairstyles.I have never really understood Japan to its full extent and hopefully never will. Throughout the film, the statuses, jobs and relationships of farmers and Samurai are given. It was made very clear exactly the context of these historical occupations and how they interact with one another. I always thought that Samurai were the knights of feudal Japan. It seems, however, that they are more akin to today's mercenaries. The way that the contextual statuses are woven within the film adds to how believable the film is. I was taken by how little these characters seemed like actors playing roles and rather actual Samurai.It is important to mention the runtime once more. I know I may be lingering slightly but so did the movie so take it up with Akira Kurosawa. I you were using this review as a recommendation and weren't expecting a gargantuan epic; I honestly couldn't recommend this film to you. While it was an enjoyable story, it is not a film that I will ever willingly return to. There are huge pacing issues making the film often drag a black and white cinematic parachute.I would recommend you watch this film once. Mainly so that you can show off that you watched a 3+ hour film that isn't any of the Hobbit films (this is a much better film than any of those). The characters are some of the best put on film in history and the story is dense with plot. However, it did very well to deter me from a second viewing."
tymothy,"Sep 4, 2018",3/10,"Lots of great movies stand the test of time. Seven Samurai simply doesn't. You're lying and deceiving yourself if you consider this to be a great movie.Why do people rate this so highly?1. It's in Japanese
2. It involves Samurai
3. It's old
4. Kurosawa
5. Relative obscurityAll of these factors allow people to like something non-mainstream and thus profess superiority.Look, no doubt this is a relevant film in understanding the evolution of moviemaking. But historical significance alone doesn't make for a great film. While various action shots might have been ground-breaking for the time and stunning to audiences in the 50s, they simply don't hold up decades later.The movie is extraordinarily long- well clearly, we must get a great character development of the Samurai then? Nope. Hardly anything.Fantastic dialog? Nope. Perhaps the subtitles weren't great, but discourse is extremely shallow most of the time.A real emotional involvement? A sense of urgency? Excitement? Nope. Aside from fleeting moments in the first two hours and a little later on, you get almost nothing. There's a persistent and constant malaise as characters slog through the plot.Instead the movie lags and relies on portraying mediocre sets and ""action"". I'm sure audiences in the 50s would consider the film almost immersive into various landscrapes. As a modern movie goer, a few fake trees with a backdrop isn't engaging by itself. A character falling into a pile of fake flowers shot in blakc and white does nothing for me.So yes, if you watch this you'll see the development of interesting camera techniques that would become staples of work to follow. But as a movie, bleh, terrible pacing, shallow characters and a work that falls flat emotionally. And that's the opposite what good movies are supposed to be- entertainment through delivery of a compelling story.If you want to see a Kurosawa film that still holds up, look at ""Only the Bad Sleep Well"", which has some absolutely fantastic camerawork, an engaging plot and delivers a gripping story."
drystyx,"Jul 10, 2006",10/10,"I'll start by saying I'm one of those cads who can't stand subtitles, and I'm bored by them, so how did this movie completely mesmerize me and hold me spellbound beginning to end? In short, everything about the movie was outstanding. Action-adventure-you got it. Plots and subplots-Ibsen and Williams would be envious. You already know the acting, directing, editing, etc, is superb. But what really drives me bananas about this movie and makes me never tire of watching it, is the characters. Not only do the seven samurai become beloved to us, but the farmers as well, and even some of the bandits. Each character lives and breathes beside us, to the ill fated weak samurai to the bandit who mistakenly calls Toshiru Mifune his brother. But the four chief farmers share center stage with the seven samurai, along with a few female characters, Grandad, and the bandit chieftan. One of the farmers, Ricici, is so brave that he could be called the eighth samurai. And each of the four makes a notable sacrifice to hold onto their crops. One loses his daughter's honor, one loses his home, one loses his wife, and one loses his life. The subtle friendships, such as between Ricici and the apprentice samurai, are expertly hinted at without being expository. Believe me, even if you hate subtitles, I feel confident that you will love this movie."
cavalry-2,"Jan 26, 1999",10/10,"""Shichinin no samurai""(Seven Samurai) is about a raging war between 40 trampling horse-bandits and a group of timid peasants led by 7 samurai with 7 unique personalities and 7 special types of skills. The 7 samurai engineered the war such that they beat the bandits against incredible odds. Never in the history of film has a war been narrated so elaborately, efficiently, lucidly, and with great fun, lots of surprises, and unpredictable through and through. In this war, each killing counts, whereas in many of the wars portrayed in films, you don't feel s*** even when a thousand men is bloody shown to be wiped out by nukes. That's just one little thing making this movie stands out, and God, there are plenty more, so by the name of the Mother, don't miss this movie, and you shall see, Coppla's ""Aprocalpse Now"", and Wolfgan Peterson's ""Das Boot"", even Spieldberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" and George Lucas's ""Start War"" all willingly bow before this moive. In one word, it is the best and most humane and fun war movie of all times. Bravo, Kurosawa!"

JB1865,"Jun 2, 2010",10/10,"A small town of farmers is being threatened by a gang of bandits and the only way they can protect themselves is to hire samurai.Seven Samurai is an absolute masterpiece in every sense of the word.Akira Kurosawa's direction is a complete delight; he manages to pack so much into every single frame of Seven Samurai's entire 3 1/2 hour run time. Every shot is so cleverly set up that it doesn't really feel like a movie. Kurosawa has a knack for finding every nook and cranny in a room to get angles that make you feel like you are right in the movie.The characters may be the best part of Seven Samurai. Every one of the seven samurai is vibrant, interesting, and emotionally complex. Even after 3+ hours you are left wanting to know more about each of them. Which may be my only complaint about Seven Samurai, but that is a good thing as well. It is much better to finish a movie wanting to see more than wishing there were less.The acting is beyond belief as well. The entire cast manages to squeeze as much as they can out of their character. Toshiro Mifune gives one of the greatest performances of all time as Kikuchiyo and creates a character that you just can't take your eyes off of whenever he is on screen. Mifune's acting goes beyond just how he says his lines or his facial expressions but his every movement is unique and a part of his character. Takashi Shimura's performance as Kanbe Shimada, the defacto leader of the seven, is equally as great or close to it.The sets and costumes make you feel as you have been transported to ancient Japan the action will leave you on the edge of the your seat. The sheer scope Seven Samurai is unparalleled for a movie made in the 50s.I have absolutely nothing bad to say about Seven Samurai and I believe that it is essential viewing for any fan of film. Seven Samurai is a wonder to behold and I am in complete awe ever time I watch it."
Jerry73,"Jul 10, 1999",10/10,"This film is one of the greatest ever made, and a testament to the genius of Kurosawa.

I was amazed at Kurosawa's ability to really make you care for the characters;  something almost always ignored in films today. A masterpiece of action and drama."
CinemaClown,"Aug 9, 2013",N/A,"One of the greatest films ever made, Akira Kurosawa's Seven Samurai is crafted with such grace, passion & dedication that every moment of its 207 minutes runtime feels relevant to its plot, and it never feels overlong. Original, arresting & thoroughly entertaining, it is timeless masterpiece that hasn't lost one bit of its potency despite being over 60 years old. Brought to life with remarkable control & composure and sustaining its grip on the viewers with effortless ease, it has inspired & influenced countless films & filmmakers over the years yet has never been bettered. An impeccable feat of first-rate direction, faultless screenplay & bravura performances that's engrossing, amusing & consistently engaging from the first frame to the last, Akira Kurosawa's magnum opus is a meticulously crafted epic that finds its master storyteller at the top of his game, and is a work of absolute perfection."
SPZMaxinema,"Apr 8, 2022",7/10,"This film is technically brilliant for its time for sure. The wiping camera transitions and movements, the wide shots, the capturing of emotion from the actors, plus very talented acting from Toshiro Mifune made me recognize the film as unique and pretty special. Unfortunately the film goes on way too long and you definitely feel the length at a certain point, and I think one of the worst parts of the movie was the younger samurai's relationship with Shino and the romance there. Kind of a distraction away from the main story."
ElMaruecan82,"Jul 24, 2015",10/10,"1/ BIRTH OF MODERN CINEMA :Seven Samurai, of unequal skills and experience, are hired for a dangerous mission : saving a village from bandits who plan to attack after the harvest. That very premise fathered almost every action movie for the next fifty years, from its remake ""The Magnificent Seven"" or ""The Dirty Dozen"" to ""Inglourious Basterds"" or ""The Expendables"". Quoting Ebert, the film also introduces the first Samurai Kambei (Takashi Shimura) while he rescues a young boy by disguising as a monk, which foresees the narrative device of introducing the hero through an unrelated mission. Another interesting trivia is that the original script counted on six Samurai, with Toshiro Mifune playing Seiji Myagushi's role as Kyuzo, the taciturn master swordsman. But then Kurosawa had a strike of genius.2/ EVERY GROUP NEEDS A SCENE-STEALER :Among the six, you have the zealous rookie Katsushiro (Isao Kimura) the amiable although less-skilled Heihachi, played by another recognizable face : Minoru Chiaki (the tallest one), the wise and experienced leader, the stone-faced stoic bad-ass, and other competent lieutenants. That gallery, that was to be reproduced in several films, was incomplete. As interesting and relatable as they were, Kurosawa understood that they would be boring without the obligatory scene-stealer, and how do you steal the thunder of serious and no-nonsense ronin? Simply by playing it in the most exuberant, flamboyant, noisy, showoff, in fact, the Toshiro Mifune way. As Kikuchiyo, Mifune is the spice, the soul of the film, much more with an attitude that never feels gratuitous.3/ CHARACTERIZE THEM THROUGH ACTION :Indeed, not only each of the Samurai is given recognizable traits, but the personalities are revealed through action, never wasted on pointless dialogue. Mifune is obviously desperate to show his skills as a samurai, wearing the most visible armors, the longest spears, overcompensating obviously. It's only later that Kanbei understands he's a farmer's son himself. And he's not the only character to have a secret, the hot-headed farmer Rikichi (Yoshio Tsuchiya) holds a terrible one and the young Katsushiro lives a romance with a villager's daughter played by the inevitable Keiko Tsushima. The village becomes the arena of another battle between classes and egos. Ronin, perceived as lustful, dangerous or greedy individuals are feared by villagers even though they're supposed to help them. But as bandits attack the weak, and samurai protect them, villagers have no other chance than trusting the Samurai and getting along with them.4/ THREE-ACT STRUCTURE :A school-case on that matter : hiring the team, preparing the battle and fighting. The sequences of equal length are handled with methodic and realistic patience. We know the samurai's value for they accept to fight in exchange of hospitality, millet and also some consideration, but it takes more to build sympathy. As it takes time for villagers to learn how to fight, the occasion of a few comedic scenes involving Kikuchyo and the poor cowardly Yohei (Bokuzen Hidari). And there's the battle, an even more heart-pounding sequence because it doesn't happen in once. It's made of preemptive strikes where they discover that the enemies have three muskets, which are like bullets from one-gun movies (Kurosawa's noir- masterpiece ""Stray Dog"" to name one) each one plays a role, each death is memorable, that's the emotional reward of 'slowness', just as Kambei who takes his time counting the number of bandits killed.5/ KNOW HOW TO USE TIME AND SPACE :""Seven Samurai"" is shot in exterior, not in studio because Kurosawa wanted to give the film the most authentic feel, regardless of the costs or delays in productions, he followed his instinct of a filmmaker. Therefore, the setting plays a pivotal role, Kambei inspects the zone and orders the construction of ditches around the village, later; groups of villagers would welcome any intruding bandit with spears.. The stratagem works as it allows them to capture bandits or kill them one by one. But bandits learns to overcome them and enter the village during a climactic downpour during which water and mud slow down every movement and make the battle more chaotic and the thrills more breathtaking, and the ultimate confrontation more emotionally satisfying.6/ MASTER DIRECTOR, EDITOR AND STORYTELLER :Kurosawa directed these battle scenes with a remarkable craftsmanship, swinging between large panoramic shots with standard classics like the enemy peering from over a cliff and horsemen riding it down, to more close-ups of swords clinching each other. Watching the film, I was left with the impression that Kurosawa didn't take chances but on the contrary, the most different and awkward angles he could, and thanks to a painstaking dedication to editing, he got this magnificent result. Kurosawa was a great director because he mastered two things : editing and storytelling.7/ LEGACY :So, if there ever was a center of Cinema's universe, no one could be as influential for modern film-making as the Japanese Master. ""Rashomon"" was the first movie to use the unreliable narrator device and alternate views of the same reality, and ""Hidden Fortress"" and ""Yojinbo"" would later influence two of the most popular movie series : ""Star Wars"" and Leone's Spaghetti Westerns. But for all they're worth, these legacies are nothing compared to the milestone directed in 1954, that title preceded by its reputation, perhaps the most famous Japanese movie : ""Seven Samurai"". And there are reasons why ""Seven Samurai"" is so grandly regarded, at least, seven."
maniskop,"Apr 8, 2022",7/10,"I honestly don't like to review movies based on their year and technology. This movie might have impacted a lot of other movies, directors but that does not necessarily mean it is a good movie. I mean it is an enjoyable movie that is 3 and a half hour long. But still, even though there are no blood, fight scenes are what you expect them to be. Samurai's are good, acting and their lines are well thought. They have character. But villagers are just plain stupid in lots of the scenes. Yes this was intented to prove a point in some scenes but There were lots of bad acting and overall bad scenes of villagers. But still worst was not villagers, it was bandits. They have no character. No actual dialog. Plain stupid. Except few musket shots, they don't even try to fight. They just die and try to run. I mean I understand that this was because of the great tactic of the samurai. But battle was 3 day long and they did the same thing every time.I don't like the scenario that much to be honest.But still, scenes, samurais were good. There good bits, like the samurai cutting its hair, end scene dialogue, villager samurai..
Overall I believe this movie is an ok or maybe if you push it a good movie.BUT if you think this as a 1954 movie, and think about the impact this movie gave to the industry its a 10/10."
molijonah,"Mar 31, 2006",10/10,"This is a movie I saw when it first came out and I remember I walked out of the theatre in a daze. The meticulous development of each of the characters and the charisma of the lead actor were what made this movie not just an action movie but a timeless classic. The director made no concession to time and you are so involved that the extreme length of the movie does not work against it. You are caught helpless in the grip of the story as it moves to its inexorable conclusion. The camera work, the acting, the exotic setting, all combined to make a wonderful cinematic experience. I cannot think of this movie without linking it to his other great and unique classic ""Rashomon"" that tells the story of a rape in 4 different ways. After trying to read Mr. Anthonio Damacci's comments I have to ask if he wrote in English or Japanese - I could not understand a word!"
Danarella,"May 10, 2010",10/10,"Seven Samurai opens with a group of bandits picking out a small village to rob and destroy. The village has been suffering and they do not have the capability to defend themselves. After much deliberation, some villagers insist that they need to hire Samurai in order to survive. Most of the men in the village are opposed, if only out of fear that their women will be stolen.Director Akira Kurosawa does a fine job of creating the tension in the village and showing that they have no way out of their dilemma. He also does an interesting job of introducing the characters. The samurai are introduced one by one as the men beg for help. This section of the film is a little too long; because since the film is titled Seven Samurai, we know that the men are going to be able to get seven samurais to help them.After the samurais go to the village, they begin to train the villagers to protect their village and to forget about their individual belongings. This section is very well done and builds discord for the anticipation of the attack from the bandits. When the bandits finally attack in the last third of the film, the audience has connected with the characters. The problem with the characters is that some of the samurai look alike and their names are similar if you are unfamiliar with Japanese names.The most notable part of the film is the set and costume design. The film seems to actually take place in a 15th century village. Overall the film creates a fantastic plot arc with interesting character archetypes. There is a small love story underneath the main action story. Seven Samurai truly defines the term epic."
Joseph_Gillis,"Apr 7, 2000",10/10,"This film is undoubtedly Kurosawa's masterpiece (no mean feat when one considers the opposition such as ""Throne of Blood"", ""Ran"" and ""Yojimbo""). The film's story, construction, credible and engaging characters, and that perfect ending are assets that most directors would give their eye teeth for but Kurosawa also proves himself the most economically effective director of action scenes who puts Hollywood directors like Spielberg firmly in his place: the climactic scene where he shows only horses hooves and human legs rushing hither and thither in the mud and torrential rain is most effective in conveying both the ferocity of the conflict and the panic of the villagers, and serves to prove that imagination and invention will always triumph over computer-generated images."
lasttimeisaw,"Aug 20, 2012",8/10,"There is a nuanced feeling between a new release could score an 8/10 (say THE DARK KINGHT RISE 2012) and a classic acquire the same rank, (but if divided more precisely, which I feel compulsory to do but in lack of a potential spur to re-set my entire rating system. TDKR is around 7.8-8.2 while SEVEN SAMURAI is surely wavering around 8.2-8.5).SEVEN SAMURAI, an esteemed masterpiece from the reasonably most eminent auteur, Akira Kurosawa, not only from Japan, but the wholesale film history as well, why my belated first- viewing has a tad underwhelming collision, notably juxtaposed with another Akira's chef- d'oeuvre RASHOMON (1950, 9/10), which had been my one and only entrance before SEVEN SAMURAI, this action saga of seven samurai trains local village farmers and fights against bandits has a thrilling in-depth character-building deployment and the action sequences are cutting-edge of its time. And seminally a full-flown censure upon class discrimination could reverberate till today although we are miles away from the feudal era.Against a 207 minutes running time, surprisingly I still cannot distinctively tell each samurai from their appearances and 4 of them all died from muskets is a grave ridicule of the deprivation-ridden samurai social stratum, nothing is remotely close to any dueling-style combat which I prefigured during the much-hyped final showdown. But the camera-work from Asaichi Nakai is a first-class roller-coaster ride since the fight kicks off, leaving a woeful curtain call of four disturbing graves standing under the background which potently ends the film in a provoking manner.The cast are excellent by and large, with Shimura gives a composed and sage leadership with his empathetic charisma, Mifune, on the other hand, is more rely on his own panache to contradict his identity dilemma (from a farmer-born orphan to an unclassified samurai-wannabe). Several supporting roles are also glistening, Bokuzen Hidari's chicken and wordless farmer who finally delivered his only line during his last breath is striking deep in my mind. Miyaguchi's superbly practiced swordsman also exemplifies the most orthodox samurai image, they are all among the marrow of my first viewing.The sway of the Harakiri spirit is ubiquitous, particularly among the ill-fated bandits, which occasions some random thoughts such as instead of executing themselves on the ultimate suicidal march, they could have retreated and recruited more people and then plotted their revenge which makes for a more common sense instead of being dragged from the horsed and slaughtered one by one by the samurai-farmer coalition. The storyline-setting seems to choose an easier way out and avoids undermining the film's integrity and leaving an edgy unfinished business, nevertheless is this some overt contrivance which plain suffices to facilitate the film which should be at least pointed out? Or maybe I should watch more Japanese films to digest their ethos and frame of minds?"
Eternality,"Aug 25, 2010",10/10,"After more than half a century, Seven Samurai remains to be one of the greatest works of cinema. The man behind it is Akira Kurosawa, one of the greatest filmmakers ever. He is responsible for an unsurpassed body of work that has and still continues to inspire filmmakers young and old worldwide.Few would disagree that Seven Samurai represents the definitive film of the legendary Japanese director's luminous career. In a decade which is proud to establish some of the medium's most gifted practitioners including Ingmar Bergman, Federico Fellini, Satyajit Ray, and Andrzej Wajda, Kurosawa is arguably the most influential.Seven Samurai exists in many cuts. The most rewarding is the original uncut version that runs more than 200 minutes. Do not let the lengthy runtime put you off, because there is probably no other film as incredibly well-paced as Seven Samurai. It gains tremendous momentum, and is so thoroughly enjoyable from start to end that the intermission sequence halfway through feels like the film's only liability.Repeated viewings get only better, allowing us to further appreciate Kurosawa's technical prowess and artistic vision. The film's storyline is simple: A group of poor, helpless farmers hire samurai to protect their village from ruthless, marauding bandits who steal their rice.Seven Samurai is split into three major acts: First, the seven samurai are introduced. Each is given time to develop a personality. Ironically, the longest time is given to Toshiro Mifune's character, Kikuchiyo, who needs little development for his presence immediately lights up every scene he is in. He gives the film's most entertaining performance as an impulsive, wild, and occasional clownish peasant masquerading as a samurai.In contrast, Kambei (Takashi Shimura), the leader of the group, is honorable and caring, and is in my opinion the film's best-acted role. A young inexperienced samurai, a skillful samurai who is always practicing his craft, and three other samurai whose personalities are interchangeable make up the other quintet.The second act shows the integration of the samurai into the village of farmers who give them the cold shoulder by hiding in their shabby homes when they first arrive. After all, samurai are still fundamentally killers and their instinctive reactions are triggered by fear more than anything else. Kikuchiyo makes himself useful by breaking the ice between the two social classes in perhaps the film's most hilarious set-piece.Speaking of which, Kurosawa sprinkles the film with many scenes of humor (especially those involving the bumbling Kikuchiyo) that lightens the mood of the film, creating essential camaraderie amongst the characters. And in a subplot, Kurosawa explores tradition and social stigmatism when one of the samurai forbiddingly falls in love with a daughter of a farmer.The third act showcases Kurosawa at his skillful best: the climatic battle sequences. Filmed in adverse conditions that include heavy rain, mud and strong winds, these scenes are brilliantly edited through the rapid inter-cutting of chaotic ground shots of hooves of horses and limbs of humans (farmers, samurai, and bandits) as they scurry about to kill or avoid being killed, together with distinct eye-level shots of the events that are happening. In one magnificent scene, a swarm of bandits on horses rush down from a hilltop to the village below in an uninterrupted sequence that has long been accepted as Kurosawian.Never for a moment when watching Seven Samurai do we seem puzzled. Everything is laid out clearly by Kurosawa. Before the samurai meet the farmers, we already know most of their personalities. Before the battle cry is sounded, the samurai have already taken us on a tour of the village's key defence points and their tactical strategies while training the farmers to defend themselves.With characterization and plot developments established so excellently, the joy of watching it all unfold is pure cinematic ecstasy. The art direction and costume design are exemplary. Together with the incredible cinematography and haunting music, Kurosawa effectively transports us several centuries back.In my opinion, Kurosawa's most accomplished picture is Ran (1985), a fabulously told tale of literally Shakespearean proportions. However, Seven Samurai is arguably his most entertaining, a glorious triumph that is still the standard-bearer for bravura epic filmmaking. It represents not only a cultural turning point for Japanese cinema (its Western influences are obvious) but also an important milestone in the art of filmmaking. If there is ever a film to show to students of cinema how to write, direct, and edit a movie, this is it.SCORE: 10/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
kluseba,"Sep 17, 2018",9/10,"I hesitated checking out the Japanese epic samurai drama Seven Samurai because I made the mistake to watch Kurosawa Akira's Ran a few years ago which turned out to be stiff, predictable and overlong and didn't live up to its excellent reputation. I'm relieved to realize that Seven Samurai indeed deserves the praise it gets. Ironically, it's not the best movie of the year, not even the best Japanese film of that year which was Honda Ishiro's groundbreaking Godzilla which shows how great movies were back in those days. Still, Seven Samurai is a timeless classic whose plot, duels and characters have been copied in numerous films such as The Magnificent Seven.The first thing I liked about the movie is its atmosphere. It has a quite gloomy touch as the fearful peasants and seven brave samurai have to be constantly prepared for the raids of an elevated number of ruthless bandits. As opposed to Hollywood movies, one never knows who is going to survive the next attack which builds up quite a lot of despair and tension until the very end. This atmosphere is perfectly supported by the sinister black and white cinematography and the simplistic yet fitting soundtrack.The settings are also carefully chosen. The village has a raw and simple charm but can turn from a little piece of paradise into a muddy hell rather quickly. It's definitely a very difficult battlefield. The romantic scenes in the fields of flowers in the middle section are contrasted by the torrential rain during the epic final battle that ends the movie on a high note.The characters are fascinating and fleshed out. Each of the seven samurai has different character traits. The most impressive ones are the aged leader Kambei with his strong moral compass, the hopeless young romantic Katsushiro and the savage outsider Kikuchiyo. Even the villagers are quite unique. The elder miller and village patriarch Gisaku who refuses to evacuate, the hotheaded Rikichi who hides a sad secret and the emotional farmer's daughter Shino are only some of these fascinating characters.The acting performances make the characters even better. Shimura Takashi's performance as intellectual leader is absolutely believable and one can understand why the other characters follow his commands despite risking their lives. Mifune Toshiro is brilliant as tough guy with a soft core who constantly tries to improve his reputation which leads to some brutal, desperate but also humorous scenes not unlike Eli Wallach's performance as Tuco in the iconic The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. On the other side, Miyaguchi Seiji contrasts the young and emotional characters with his performance as calm, disciplined and serious swordsman. The actors and actresses aren't only convincing on their own but complement one another perfectly. Their diversity is a strength in this film.The directing has to be pointed out as well. Despite its colossal length, the movie never felt boring because it found the right balance between the main plot and numerous efficient side stories that add depth to the different characters. The camera work is calm and precise and on a much higher level than contemporary action movies with shaky cameras. On the other side, the use of wipes to change between scenes gives the movie a more fluid pace at times. The mixture of calm cinematographic techniques and a few more dynamic elements is perfectly balanced.In the end, I have only positive things to say about this movie. If you like action films, this groundbreaking film is an iconic milestone. If you prefer dramas, you will find plenty of it in the complex relationships between the different characters. If you like period films, this movie brings the life in sixteenth century Japan to life in a brilliant way. Seven Samurai is a movie that anybody who truly likes cinema should watch at least once in his lifetime."
jlazbuggy,"Jul 1, 2021",7/10,"I was impressed with this movie when I first saw it a few years ago, but as one who grew up with The magnificent Seven, it just doesn't hold a candle to that movie, even if it is the original."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Feb 1, 2006",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's ambitious Seven Samurai is a film that has been emulated and duplicated and imitated in almost every medium you can think of, probably most in books and movies, as in the cases above. It is a classic story of protection and thinly disguised revenge that has tremendous satisfactory power, but Kurosawa knows enough to avoid over-simplifying the impact of his film by introducing fault into the characters being protected.It is never really proved whether or not Kikuchio's (Toshiro Mifune, a Kurosawa veteran) assertion that the farmers were not nearly as poor (and therefore unable to pay them) as they let on is actually true, but it introduces doubt as to whether they are perfect victims. This is, of course, a movie about people, not about two dimensional characters, and any forward thinking village is going to try to save up whatever wealth or food that they can compile in order to ensure their own survival.I won't pretend to understand completely what compels samurai to do what they do, to risk their lives for such little (if any) reward, but I know that it is something that is almost universally accepted by samurais, and if I'm not mistaken, the samurai that abandon that code are known as Ronin, a not very enviable title.The movie is definitely something of a commitment at three and a half hours, but it flows smoothly and it takes the time to get to know its characters, which allows it to present the real world so much more clearly, and I was surprised to find that one of the most powerful scenes in the entire film took place in the last minute or two of the movie.This is an intense anti-war film that allows you to identify with three different sides in battle, the victims, the protectors, and the oppressors (although that third not quite as much), and I think that one of the most important things that it does is that it provides a look into an ancient Japanese culture and makes an assertion about what may have happened that allowed for more flexibility in their culture rather than a strict adherence to established traditions, much like Chinua Achebe does in his novel Things Fall Apart, but I digress.One of the things that is introduced very early in the film is the fact that samurai are not entirely trusted by the villagers, and it is strictly forbidden that they mix with their culture, they are treated almost as subhumans, but their battlefield prowess is intensely desired. When a conflict arises about a local man's daughter becoming involved with a young samurai who is there to protect the village, he demands action and retribution, but the well-being of the rest of the village is deemed more important.There is a lot going on in the movie in terms of societal roles in Japanese culture, which affects the way things pan out in the movie (although Kurosawa was known for rebelling against such expectations, particularly later in his career), and like so many of Kurosawa's films, there is so much going at so many levels that multiple viewings of the film will reveal more and more things going on that went unnoticed on the first time. Argued by many to be Kurosawa's greatest film, The Seven Samurai is certainly one among many."
slowcando,"Jul 11, 2023",7/10,"To mark the 1000th film I've seen in my 45 years so far (or at least all the ones I can remember & identify) I wanted to choose a monumental historically-significant title. I shortlisted 6 titles and asked Redditors to vote for which one in a poll (sadly, IMDB boards are no more).After 200 votes Seven Samurai was the clear winner over the not-insignificant pictures of Kubrick's Paths of Glory, Tarkovsky' Stalker, Huston's Man Who Would Be King, Herzog's Nosferatu and Lean's Lawrence of Arabia.Looking at the mighty 8.6 IMDB score, and hundreds of user-reviews proclaiming Seven Samurai as ""greatest film of all time"" further confirms how extremely well-regarded this monumental picture is.My only previous Kurosawa was Rashomon (a decent 6/10, but ultimately underwhelming) and the only other similar film I've seen is Inagaki's Samurai I: Musashi Miyamoto (5/10, watchable but not particularly recommended). All three have the animalistic acting of Toshiro Mifune in a main role. All three are stories of a similar era, were made in the 50's and feature lots of forest!With the modest ratings I gave Rashomon & Samurai Miyamoto I went in to Seven Samurai with lowered expectations, despite its hype elsewhere. This lessened the risk of overhype, and enabled me to enjoy Seven Samurai for what it is now: an entertaining but dated & sometimes sluggish action flick of an interesting historical era, set in a small contained place (it's not a sweeping epic with different locations) with good performances, nice camera and very minimal yet effective score.The first half is a bit of a slog, but well anchored by the Kambei character (he gives off those agreeable Morgan Freeman vibes). It picks up nicely in the second-half, with some fun moments of humour too, mostly involving Mifune's character...or should I say, Mifune himself as he seems to play the same man in every film, at least from what I've seen.Two other samurai get prominent roles, tho' the other three are quite interchangeable: I often got their names & appearances confused. The antagonists don't get any characterisation at all. The truly-greatest action films all tend to have memorable baddies...The dated aspect is mostly from the action: while it's tempting to rate this film from a 1950's perspective (when the action would've been fresh, dynamic and revolutionary) from a 2020's perspective it's sometimes clumsy, and safe. But it's still generally satisfying, and believable enough to allow suspension of disbelief. The extended final battle is well done, tho' the Bandit's tactics were contrived to be quite stupid. The very final scene, and sentiment, is a strong one and a thoughtful way to end the movie.There's a good bunch of strong character moments throughout, my favourite is a scene with the budding young couple: we get a detailed close-up of the woman imploring her man to finally kiss her. The repressed desperation is palpable, and the use of close-up clever as before this we only saw women from a distance, as did the men in the film (and indeed men from Japan's history generally). This repression of attraction & sexuality is subtly communicated by the male character's frozen reaction at now having the female face so close to his own.Overall a 7/10 seems fair. I enjoyed it a little more, and had less reservations, than with Rashomon or Samurai Miyamoto. I remain interested to check out more Kurosawa, tho' the next one will be a later production (Ran, Kagemusha or Dreams are on the shortlist). Mifune's predictable yet likeable performance makes me interested in Inagaki's Samurai sequels after all. Maybe they get better.I can't recommend Seven Samurai for everyone, tho'. Those averse to older films, or shouty angry nervous japanese dialogue, won't have their minds changed by this. I do recommend it for film-fans looking for classic movies, however do not board the hype train before watching :)________________ ps - avoid the BFI DVD: it has lazy subtitles, even missing entire sentences out. These subs are burnt-in and cannot be disabled or replaced. I own the movies I watch on DVD or Bluray and am almost-always happy with these, but this time I had to resort to online-streaming which had superior subtitles."
julenka,"Nov 30, 2005",3/10,"Maybe I'm used to the fast paced action of more recent movies, but I simply could not stand how sloooowly this movie crawled along. There would be full minute breaks in between dialogue where two characters would just be gazing at each other wistfully, with the camera panning back and forth between them.OK, OK.. I get it. It's an important moment. Can we move along now? Don't get me wrong; I tend to be one of the few people in my generation of viewers who can actually appreciate the nuances of a slow-paced movie. I can appreciate a good movie even when it's in black and white and set in one room, like with 12 Angry Men. There's nothing wrong with creating a character slowly, and building up the tension to the climax.. but this movie was something else. I had my DVD playing at 2x speed by the end of the movie, just so I could get it over and done with.It was a bore. Give it a miss."
PIST-OFF,"May 21, 1999",9/10,The Seven Samurai is one of the best movies to come out of Asia ever. This well directed grandfather of Samurai movies is one of the most influential films of all time. Without the Seven Samurai there is no Magnificent Seven. Without the Magnificent Seven there is no Dirty Dozen. Without the Dirty Dozen there is no Sylvester Stallone or Arnold Schwarzenegger. This movie is only slighty undone by it's length. And for those who can't tolerate either black and white movies or subtitles this could be rough. Great acting on the part of the all actors and one of the best screenplays in film history. Akira Kurosawa is truly a master of his art.
tracy.carver,"Jul 10, 2001",10/10,"I loved it.  This movie is sophisticated and thoughtful filmmaking that is so much more than the simple title.  Wanna know where Coppola, Spielberg, and Lucas got some ideas?  Watch this movie to find out.  The acting is sublime -- the expressions and vocalizations are effective even to someone like me who knows absolutely no Japanese.  The music is wonderful.  The cinematography is subtle and effective, with angles and focus chosen to emphasize the plot elements and mood.  It feels highly realistic; the samurai aren't holier-than-thou lords of the sword wielding mystical powers -- they're merely trained men in a profession, men with thoughts and feelings.  The weak and helpless villagers aren't necessarily really that week and helpless.  And we aren't inflicted with atrocities perpetrated by the baddies so that we have evidence to make us pick a side.  There are no tiresome epic battles with the the characters drawing upon mysterious wells of strength to finally prevail -- they're just fights that happen as they happen.  I could go on.  Dang, this movie was good!"
