themadmovieman,"Dec 21, 2019",2/10,"I've got nothing against movie musicals, director Tom Hooper, or even anybody who's a part of making this film. But goodness me, Cats is an absolute monstrosity. Garish, non-sensical, boring and everything in between, it's a pompous and pointless musical that plays out with barely a redeeming feature, proving one of the most unbearable cinema experiences I've had in a very long time.While I haven't been a big fan of Hooper's work in the past, particularly Les Misérables, Cats pales in comparison to anything the director has made before, failing on all levels in its pathetic attempts to provide even a semblance of fun, magical theatre, and instead staggering along through its repetitive and frankly tedious story on its way to a terrible ending that can't come soon enough.There's nothing positive I have to say about this movie. Les Misérables, for all its faults, at least had a degree of spectacle, emotion and drama, whereas Cats is little more than an experiment gone wrong: a horrifying Frankenstein's monster that attempts to blend modern cinematic techniques with classic West End storytelling.First, the visual effects are extremely offputting. Whether it's the uncanny CGI human/cat-like figures, the inconsistent and distracting scaling and sizing issues, or even the plasticky, garish look of the whole film, Cats is a really unpleasant spectacle. And for all of the technical expertise that clearly went into pulling it off, it all feels squandered on a misguided and painfully showy movie.Next, Hooper's directing is jagged and meandering throughout. While the screenplay is hardly a work of art, Cats lacks even the slightest bit of show-stopping stage energy, symptomatic of direction that leaves the film wandering aimlessly right the way through.Hooper's visual style is uninspiring and unimaginative, the musical and dance numbers are repetitive and dull, and even the biggest, best dramatic set-pieces are completely missing any sort of real presence, instead just fading into the movie's jarringly inconsistent structure.The pacing is a massive problem throughout, as the film shirks the need for even a basic three-act structure in exchange for a horribly repetitive yet still inconsistent layout. Basically, for two hours, it goes like this: Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. Dialogue, mini song, big musical number. And repeat. Again and again and again.In that, Cats proves so boring, so predictable, and clearly so without life that it's happy to just sit and move you from one musical number to the next. A great movie musical should organically blend song and dialogue, with each complementing the other with the goal of developing the story wherever possible.Cats is so aimless and repetitive, that the pathetic excuse for a story barely seems to move at any point. Instead, it's just a vehicle for big West End musical numbers on the big screen, all built up to in jarring fashion that makes each song more awkward than the last.That story, too, is almost unbearable throughout. I won't pass judgment on the original stage show, but in the case of this film, the plot is non-sensical, the characters uninteresting, the screenplay unfocused, and the emotion painfully superficial.A little bit of fantasy is fine by me, but when a film is constantly repeating its fantasy mumbo-jumbo about cats being sent to heaven or something or other, it gives no incentive to keep watching, worsened by a total lack of character focus or even a consistent main lead.Francesca Hayward plays the young, new cat to join the tribe, so you'd think that she would be the main focus for the story. However, the movie is so distracted by trying to cram in as many A-listers and side characters as possible that the whole thing feels like an endless meet-and-greet, still introducing new characters deep into the latter stages, and not even giving a second to let Hayward's cat take centre stage.There's no story because it barely gets going. For what feels like an hour and a half, the film jumps between random characters' introductory musical numbers, and then, remembering it has to wrap things up in a two-hour window, abruptly shifts to tying up loose ends that were never really established in the first place.As a result, despite the immense acting talent on display, none of the characters are memorable, and none play even a leading role for you to connect with at any point. Alongside Hayward, there's Robbie Fairchild and Laurie Davidson, both of whom seem to be on screen enough to warrant a leading role, but neither even gets the slightest bit of attention from the screenplay.So, whenever their characters take any sort of role in the main plot, it comes across as sudden and out of left-field, a problem only caused because the movie spends so much time trying to entertain you with A-listers dressed as CGI cats. But even for all the Taylor Swift cameos in the world, it's surely not worth steamrolling simple character and narrative development.In short, Cats is an absolute atrocity. From a director with an already wobbly track record in the musical genre, this film is an utter disaster, failing to capture any sense of spectacle or fun, and instead meandering and wandering through a non-sensical, boring and predictable story that's seemingly used mostly as a platform for some big West End musical numbers and A-list cameos.There's nothing good to say about Cats, and unless you really want two hours of pain at the cinema, I suggest you stay as clear as possible."
itsnotrafi,"Dec 20, 2019",2/10,"I can't imagine how much the actors must've been paid to have this in their resume. From Swift to Elba, JHud to Rebel Wilson. Judy Dench, even! No amount of acting talent could save this sorry excuse for a self-indulgent furry fantasy"
GrantKanigan,"Dec 25, 2019",N/A,"There is a wall in my house. The wall is a simple wall, eight feet tall, and fifteen feet wide, it sits in a corner in the basement. It has been painted beige, with a few coats to cover up the bumps and scratches from coats before. It's got it's idiosyncrasies, the way the light jumps off the paint, the not so even drywalling underneath. Stare at it long enough, and it begins to speak to you - or at least allow you to speak to it. Maybe there's something to the wall - or maybe it's just my romantic illusions of inspiration and contemplation that bring life to it. My point is this - staring at that blank wall for two hours is far more inspiring, interesting and enlightening than watching even just two minutes of the cinematic colonoscopy that is ""Cats."" A film so awful, so ridiculous and so void of substance its very existence is an affront to musicals, film and theatre. Unless you're a fan of 'so bad it's good' cinema, stay away. This is a watershed moment in bad movie history."
sjreid2003,"Dec 21, 2019",1/10,"Sorry to pile on, but in my 55 years I have never walked out of a movie until now. We had high hopes, we love musicals, but good lord, this was awful on every level."
saraah_xo,"Feb 2, 2020",1/10,The most entertaining part of this entire movie was reading these hilariously bad reviews. It was SO boring and hard to watch.
andrewsk8,"Jan 5, 2020",1/10,"In 25 years this film will have a weird cult following, and an aged James Franco will make a ""meta"" film about it. Until then, it will remain universally regarded as an utter shambles."
nxescii,"Dec 25, 2019",1/10,Honestly I wish I was joking. Just everything was completely terrible. James Corden was cripplingly awful but that's nothing particularly surprising. Leaving the cinema I'd felt as if my soul had been sucked dry. Avoid at all cost.
irishboy141,"Dec 24, 2019",1/10,"This film is truely a masterpeice in unintentional horror. The effects are so special I'm going to have nightmares for weeks to come. Why they didn't just dress the actors in costumes and makeup I have no idea, either the filmmakers are lazy  or someone wanted to push the boundries of visual effects. Cats pushes those effects right off a cliff into the uncanny valley. The design and look is freakin disgusting.I never saw the stage musical, so I didn't know what I was in for. This movie that has no plot, it's just a bunch of random cats introducing themselves. I tried to enjoy it as a so-bad-it's-good cringefest, but the lack of plot and the terrible effects make it impossible.If you can't even look at the screen without feeling annoyed & disgusted, it's impossible to enjoy it in anyway.Thanks Tom Hooper."
jerseypiper77,"Dec 25, 2019",1/10,"I'm not a praying man, but I was praying so hard for this movie to end. From the fist minute, I knew this movie was going to be a disaster. What a waste of talented actors."
tashlast,"Jan 12, 2020",1/10,"If I thought I had any will to live before, this movie destroyed it. I went home traumatized, my beloved cat of 4 years was on my bed sleeping and I almost called the adoption center to put her up on their listing. I didn't get rid of her, but I can never look at her or other cats the same way again.Rating -60/5"

emilymoore-57893,"Dec 30, 2019",6/10,"I'm probably going to get attacked for this, but I didn't think the movie was that bad. Yes, the cats had human teeth but what do you expect when it's a group of humans, dressing up as cats? The singing was great and the dancing/choreography was also phenomenal. The cast and crew work really hard and hey if you hate it, you hate it but I'm just confused as to how the reviews are so awful."

barawlings-56532,"Dec 20, 2019",1/10,Not a lot more I can add to the reviews that have already been written. The directors obviously thought that by throwing a load of A list actors at this it would somehow make up for it's short comings. James Corden was terrible (as usual).
tsparis-54249,"Mar 12, 2020",10/10,"I got to get real with you. Before this movie, I had high functioning depression. I tried all the methods of beating it. I took meds, I snorted curry, but nothing would stop it. Then the trailer dropped. It was like the clouds parted. Seeing James Corden as a cat was all I needed. In the days to come, I looped the trailer over and over. I couldn't get enough. When the movie came out, I bought the first ticket, trampled a girl to get in, and sat in the first row. And all my sadness dissipated. It was beautiful. In that moment I had an out of body experience. Seeing Judy Dench lick her leg and watching Taylor Swift being slightly less annoying than usual all combined with James Corden was too much.
I got home that night and threw out all my meds and curry. I didn't need them anymore. Since then I have devoted myself to watching the movie five times a day while sitting on my head. I am the proud owner of so many cats, I lost count. My neighbors think me strange and Dad said something about disowning me, but it matters not. I have all I need. I no longer shower so I can make time for this glorious masterpiece. The sight of Jason Derulo crawling around alone is enough to wash my body clean enough for years. My hair practically cleans itself now. I can only hope you experience this meowsterpiece in the same way I did.
Cats gets a 10/10. It's the least I can give it."
DrinkBathwater,"Dec 24, 2019",7/10,"Cats is incredibly surreal. It's barely a movie, I don't know what it is.Now, don't get me wrong, it was hilarious. The wonky facial expressions, lingering songs, and downright creepy mannerisms were quite the hoot. Almost all of the audience was there to laugh at the movie. For good reason. There were two people in the theater who were taking it seriously (a young couple on a date. Oops, that's a poor choice of movies), but they turned around by the end of the ""film"" and started chuckling.It's so strange how a piece of media like this can exist. Despite how unwatchable it is, the movie was weirdly hypnotizing. Well, I guess we are one with the jellicles now. Whatever that means."
nrapny-01694,"Dec 23, 2019",5/10,"Hyped as the worst film of the decade so much that it didnt seem THAT bad while watching. Kind of a reversal of hyping something as amazing only for it to be just ok.The first few songs are quite unorganized and Rebel Wilson's song is disturbing, at least to me.
After Judy dench shows up it gets decently entertaining. The dance number after that is good and the absolute showstopper, was Skimbleshanks The Railway Cat. Jennifer Hudson was Jennifer Hudson. She was good. If the first half was as organized and taken care of as the second half was, it would be much better. McKellen was very good as well.Look, CATS is a hard show to even sell to a stage audience. It's an acquired taste. It's not for everyone. Some parts (cough) Skimbleshanks, were very well done while other parts (sneeze) Rebel Wilson's song were atrocious."
TxMike,"Jul 2, 2020",N/A,"I have been a big fan of ""Cats"" over the years and I even have the stage soundtrack on my USB stick to play in the car. In 1998 they released a filmed a stage version, masterfully performed, but with cameras set up from various points to get both full, wide shots and very intimate close-up shots. There is no audience applause at all, so it was probably filmed only with the cast and crew present. To me that is the definitive film version, a real ""10 of 10"" for fans of the musical.With that as a background I watched this new movie version last night on BluRay from my local library. While it is not nearly as bad as many are rating it (as of today it has 48% votes of ""1"") I found it to be a bit too cheesy I suppose in an attempt to appeal to a wider audience. Inclusion of such famous personalities as Rebel Wilson and James Corden to play overweight cats in attempts at humor didn't work at all. And Taylor Swift, bless her little heart, just isn't a good enough singer to do the solo number assigned to her character.So, while much of it was entertaining, and I loved the extended tap-dancing scene along the rail tracks, overall it is just a shadow of the properly done stage musical. The attempts to scale it up to include a broader set of London locations just doesn't work very well.Surprisingly, Ian McKellen, who isn't known for his singing, is actually very good as Gus the Theater Cat. I like Jennifer Hudson, a gifted singer, but in her attempt ""to make it her own"" just didn't come over well singing ""Memory."" Elaine Paige did it on stage so much better and once you have seen and heard that then the other versions just don't compare.And finally Francesca Hayward, a ballerina, has the role of Victoria, a discarded cat new to the Jellicle Ball and who serves as narrator. She has a couple of songs and while she doesn't have a powerful stage singing voice she actually was better than some of the ""personalities"" that were added to the cast to help draw viewers.So, I'm glad I watched it, as a fan of the ""Cats"" stage musical it was fun to see a somewhat different take on the story, and the extras on the disc are interesting, but overall this is probably a movie that should not have been made."
CalebCarr,"Dec 22, 2019",1/10,"I'm currently listening to the original sound track to try and cleanse myself of the 'film' I just saw. It was equal parts a bland tedious trudge to get through, and a confusing horrifically misjudged spectacle of disaster. The tone was all over the place. James Corden got some laughs almost purely from the way he seemed to be embarrassed to be in the picture. Jennifer Hudson's melodramatic hysterics were more cringe inducing than genuinely emotional. Sweeping epic songs are visualised in the most bland and ugly way possible.
I spent the whole film feeling frustrated at seeing a bunch of songs I like being butchered. Constantly interrupting the flow of a song to simply 'say' a line as opposed to 'singing' it isn't edgy, it's just worse.
The whole thing is so misguided that I'm sure even the on set catering was mucked up somehow."
mottogamoto,"Jan 27, 2020",1/10,As Phoebe said.... My eyes! My eyes! What have I just watched? I wish I could get partial amnesia or something and forget this experience.
flamehorse-86606,"Dec 28, 2019",1/10,"The reviews are right this time. The cast does its job just fine. The songs and dances are well performed. It's a shame, because I feel terrible for the cast. It's not their fault. I don't think they knew what visual effects were going to be applied with CGI in post.This film is unintentionally one of the greatest horror movies ever made, worthy of recognition alongside The Exorcist. You are that uncomfortable as you sit through it.Whoever gave the final go-ahead to make the cats look the way they look does not know what cats or people look like. The characters do not look quite feline enough and do not look quite human enough. They fall into a gray area somewhere in between and we call this ""the uncanny valley."" This movie is more horrifying than ""It: Chapter 1"" if you are a coulrophobe.I would rather it were ""Spiders."" You would at least know what you're getting into then and I cannot stand spiders.The most nightmarish moments are after certain songs when the cats start meowing or lapping milk and water out of bowls. I felt like the Nazis at the end of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark."" I thought my face was going to melt off.My friends and I went to it after laughing at all the bad reviews because we wanted to make fun of it, but it's so visually horrid that it held us tight in its Uncanny Valley grip for the whole of its two hours. Who in the production department looked at the finished computer generation of the cats' appearances and said, ""That looks good. Let's go with that!""?If you go, DO NOT TAKE YOUR CHILDREN. This movie will horrify them far more than anything Pennywise the Clown could come up with."
PretoriaDZ,"Jan 29, 2020",1/10,"Just try and make it through just the trailer! Then think about how many people in the world could have been helped by that money. Think about how many people may need therapy if they manage to sit through this feline disaster. I always held 'Slime People' as my nominee for worst film ever made (budget was $56,000 in 1963) but this has replaced it."
shadowhawke-26288,"Feb 27, 2021",9/10,"I cannot even comprehend all the negative reviews! The animatronics are great, and the singing and acting are pretty good. C'mon, we pretty much all know the story and what to expect. THiS IS CUTE.If you don't already know the story, well, then the movie won't make the actual musical/story any better.If you've seen the actual musical (or several times, like I have...) then this is a pretty good representation."
darrenbjones,"Jan 3, 2020",7/10,"I really don't know why this film is getting so much hate. It's a fun piece of whimsy based on the hugely successful stage play of the same name.
Tom Hooper has put together a star studded cast, created a coherent plot that links together the various musical pieces and it's a great experience.
It starts off slowly but once it kicks into high gear, it's mesmerising through to the end. Just like the stage play it makes little sense, street cats gather to perform for the old matriarch Queen cat. She will decide which of them deserves to be elevated to a new life. Makes no sense but neither do cats in real life.
The effects are great and yes they are cat people, THAT'S THE STAGE PLAY TOO!!! In a world where we are happy to have Bradley Cooper voice a humanoid Racoon but we freak out about people looking like cats then I have to suspect all the fuss and negativity surrounding this is just false offence.
It's not got a huge amount of replay value but it was great and definitely worth catching on the big screen. Francesca Hayward was fantastic as Victoria, her dancing is incredible, Idris Elba was menacing as Macavity Jennifer Lawrence has some serious pipes. For me, one of the standout performances was Robert Fairchild as Munkustrap.
Does it say anything about our humanity? Does it have a deep rooted message that will change you? No.
Does it showcase the weirdness and self indulgence that your household cat, sitting across the room from you, quietly judging you, displays on a daily basis? Yes."

I would need even more than they were on to make it through the movie again without ending it all in the movie theatre with a plastic straw.Also we need to save Judi Dench from whoever has forced her to be in this cinematic representationr."

This includes Judi Dench, Ian McKellen, James Corden, Rebel Wilson, Taylor Swift and others.Really, I thought Hudson was trying to cough up a hairball. She should have.

GabeLewis,"Jan 3, 2020",5/10,"Honestly I dont get the hate for this film. It was fine. Not amazing, certainly not terrible. Two weeks after release I sat in a sold out cinema with an entertained audience a lot of whom cried at appropriate moments. Yes it's weird, and at times boring because the songs just keep bleeding into each other, but overall its an entertaining spectacle that kids will like. Not nearly as bad as people have been saying. The Mr Mestophalies scene and the scene where she sings memory are the two best scenes. You cant fault the dancing performers or most of the singing the sets and vfx are solid for the most part and it's actually really impressive technically. It's fine."

No matter what I was still excited for it. I watched it the first time and was fairly confused the first half. Then once I was in the proper mindset and listened to the words of the music it was beautiful. A couple days later I watched it again with a new appreciation and loved it."
valeriewat,"Dec 27, 2019",7/10,"I don't understand why so many critics & audience members hated this movie so much. I don't typically like musicals but I actually liked this. The dancing & singing were great. I loved the 2 leads, Victoria & Munkustrap, who's faces & dancing were captivating to watch. Jennifer Hudson's singing made me cry, it was so well done. I thought the cgi was actually pretty cool & amazing. The only actor bit I didn't like was Taylor Swift. Yeech, she was bad. It was like she didn't even try to move like a cat. Don't know why some reviewers slammed that the plot made no sense. The plot was actually very clear. The move kept me entertained."

Do not waste your time on it.
onlyjimjohnson,"Dec 23, 2019",1/10,"I went expecting it to be bad. But sometimes bad can be entertaining. This was just bad. There was no entertainment value in its badness. It's like the cinematic equivalent of the Tide pod challenge. Many in the theater could not take it and left. Those of us who stayed only succeeded in poisoning themselves. Not much of an accomplishment. I found myself angry-angry at the people who made it, angry at the people who distributed it. It is an indictment of capitalism that someone can sell something this bad and not face imprisonment."
ryanpellatt-35894,"Dec 23, 2019",1/10,"Before watching this movie, I was very happy with my mental state and life in general. I had a family, people who loved me as much as I loved them back. An amazing wife, 2 beautiful children and... I'm sorry but this is so hard to write... a cat. I thought despite the bad reviews and creepy previews that I could still find some joy in this movie as I have been able to find joy in many things in my life. However, I got ten minutes into the movie and my body wouldn't let me get up out of the chair, I was paralyzed as the horrible images, ear destroying songs, and dialogue that seemed to be written by a mentally challenged dodo bird was forced upon me. It has been several days since I left that theatre and I will not go into specific details, but my actions have lead to my family leaving me and my cat no longer being with us. Something has taken over my mind that I never though possible, there is such anger filling me that and I feel myself falling into a deep and dark hole with no chance of escape, even the thoughts of cats remind me of the horrors I faced in that movie theatre and there is nothing I can do to stop it. I fear that I will never be the same again, all I can hope is that my mind will repress the horrid memories that I have endured over the last couple days. I beg of anyone reading this... Do not watch this movie. Just leave a bad review and move on, trust me, it has ruined my life"

tonymcintosh-38136,"Dec 31, 2019",1/10,"When you give a karaoke competition third runner up an Oscar for effectively playing herself, you're asking for trouble. And though it's taken many years, that festering sore has finally burst through the skin with Jennifer Hudson's rendition of Memory in this shockingly unpleasant movie version of a shockingly unpleasant stage show.To be fair to the makers of this abomination, the source material they had to work with is the real problem here - a painfully stupid and tuneless musical based on a collection of poems about cats, the writer of which could never in his wildest dreams have imagined someone would make into a stage play. Why would they? The answer is the key to everything that's wrong with this movie : over inflated ego.It is gargantuan ego that put Taylor Swift, Idris Elba, James Corden, and others to sign up to this and not demand to be edited out after seeing the final depressing version. It is ego that makes Rebel Wilson think she can be the same character she is in everything else she's ever done and she will be funny (spoiler: she isn't). But even these graphic demonstrations of colossal self delusion pale in comparison to Hudson's hilarious performance.To be by far the worst thing about the worst movie possibly ever made is in itself notable, but to quite obviously think you're by far the best thing in a profoundly important masterpiece is ego that mere mortals like you and I can only ponder on. Hudson viciously and sadistically tortures every note of Memory the way anyone with a musical bone in their body has always wanted to torture Andrew Lloyd Webber. It is the only laugh out loud moment of the whole show, and believe me, I was not the only one in the cinema laughing.What is interesting about all this though is that it makes us take a look at ourselves. We sometimes like to think of actors we've liked in various things as good folk who we'd enjoy having over to dinner, even though we've never met them. But what this movie shows is that our beloved thespians are in fact scrabbling back biters who would do anything for a feed yet think themselves superior to us and each other (and yet they all had so much trouble pretending to be cats...).And that's the sad part. Taylor Swift, James Corden, Jennifer Hudson, we already knew about. But Idris Elba, Ian McKellen, Judy Dench - we see you now. And we won't forget. And nor, Ray Winstone, will the owners of Bet365. But do keep begging them to take you back. It's the only option you have left after this."

SnoopyStyle,"Jan 7, 2021",2/10,"There has been an apocalypse. Mostly a cat-human hybrid seems to be thriving in the streets of London. They cultivate cockroaches for food and are obsessed with their own names as they sing and dance.Sometimes their faces look weird somehow. It's not all the time. In fact, it's only once in awhile but I'm fixated with the problem. Their human faces don't always match their bodies. Even when it's done perfectly, it's inhuman. I'm going to say the obvious. The CGI is unnecessary. They are better off using make-up and wear leotards. If they're using CGI, I don't understand why they kept the boobs. They need to get rid of the human boobs. Leaving all that aside, I stopped caring about the story. I don't know the point of the story. It suffers the greatest sin of any story. It's boring. More than the weird cat-human hybrid or the dancing cockroaches or the horrible jokes, this is boring."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 22, 2019",1/10,"I never ever give a 1 star rating, having crawled out of the cinema after this monstrosity I had to give it the review it deserves. I genuinely thought I had a migraine as the screen seemed out of focus and distorted, everyone else said the same. A hideous movie, the visuals detracted from the music, which was half decent, some of the performances were dire. I hate to jump on the bandwagon, but the worst movie of 2019.Excruciating. 1/10"
Joncm,"Jan 26, 2020",1/10,This film is jaw-droppingly awful. Avoid like the plague. No need to critique it. So bad it's bad. Enough said.
jordynpoodle,"Dec 23, 2019",5/10,"Honestly,I went into this hoping for a train-wreck. I saw the reviews,and laughed. But this was not what I expected. Cats 2019 feels like someone tried to digitize a Broadway production of the play, but the computer focused too much on face recognition. The choreo and singing feels straight out of the musical, no modern hip hop remixes here. All the main cats get their own songs,and they may just be only introducing themselves and that's it,but they're all done well, and I enjoyed some of it a lot, especially the opening number. 'Memories' actually brought me to tears,something that doesn't happen very often.
The obvious elephant in the room is the CGI, which,yes,does look freakish at first,but by the last third, I didn't care.
This isn't the holiday smash hit the studio was hoping for, but when you realize that it is currently going up against Star Wars, there is little hope for this to make much of a mark at the box office."
cricketbat,"Dec 20, 2019",4/10,"Meowch! I've never seen the stage version of Cats, but this movie didn't do it any favors. The CGI feline humanoids are nightmare fuel-creeping, crawling, prancing & dancing though a paper-thin plot that drops the viewer in the middle of an unfamiliar & unsettling world without any real explanations. It's also full of (mostly) lackluster musical numbers featuring songs with nonsensical lyrics. To put it simply, this film is litter-ally a cat-astrophe."
blazergirl-44797,"Dec 25, 2019",2/10,"I thought i was in a fever dream. Nope, turns out i was just watching this god-forsaken movie that felt like a bunch of Animorph characters that got stopped in the middle of the morphing to a cat and then shoved on stage."
jgcorrea,"Oct 16, 2024",4/10,"Unlike the real world, this is a strange world: Eliot's cats are much more lively and sociable with other cats. In fact, his characters are so unrealistic that you wonder if Eliot ever even came close to any cats. The versification is skillful, of course. But it's still the brilliant songs by Andrew Lloyd Webber (music) & T. S. Eliot (lyrics). Most of the cast are good singers ( especially Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy) and the new song ""Beautiful ghosts"" is alright. Nothing EXTREMELY wrong with the film as it's just as a Jukebox Musical ... it literally exists to attempt a narrative around songs, so it's fair to say that the soundtrack is *better* than the rest of the film."
afinethymedining,"Jan 5, 2021",5/10,I have never seen the Broadway production. So I went in with nothing to compare it to. I enjoyed the music and the choreography.

thoroughlyme,"Dec 20, 2019",6/10,"Outside of a few extremely weird moments, CATS is neither as consistently weird as you want it to be nor as good as the film thinks it is. You get used to the CGI after 5 minutes and after that, it's just the stage show. If you like that, you'll like the movie. I liked the movie a bit more than I liked the musical (for reasons that will become apparent) - but I also really don't like the musical.The script adds a bit more of a story than what is found in the musical, but it's never really able to turn the film into anything more than a collection of vignettes where various Cats explain why they should be the ones to ascend to the Heaviside Layer (a version of Cat Heaven) and be given a chance at a new life.The CGI isn't as monstrous as you fear, though there are plenty of times it doesn't work. Hooper films this movie in exactly the same method he filmed the Les Miserables film - lots of extended closeups and very long-lasting wide shots. The wide shots do a good job at showing off Andy Blankenbuehler's choreography, but the closeups are very unsettling.Unfortunately, the movie is only REALLY weird for about 30-40% of the time. The rest of it is fairly monotonous and it just sort of numbs you. I'd argue it's worth seeing for those weird moments - because they're REALLY weird. But, at the end of the day, if you don't like the musical, there's no chance you're gonna like this movie - because it's just the musical with slightly weirder costumes."
dalefl,"Dec 20, 2019",3/10,What the hell was that? How in the world could Hooper watch this and still release it? This goes way beyond weird; it's downright creepy at times which is magnified by all the bazillion closeups. That's not the way to watch this show. You have to see the whole stage because there are things going on all over the stage no matter which character the focus is on. With a stellar cast such as this you'd have to really go out of your way to produce a monstrosity like this. I'm sorry to say that that's pretty much what he did. I like Hooper. He's put out some really great stuff. This is not one of them.
adamkeithmossman,"Dec 24, 2019",1/10,"I'm not exactly sure what I just witnessed, and I'm sure my eyes will never recover from it, but ""Cats"" makes John Travolta's Battlefield Earth seem Oscar worthy..How did the actors and actresses even agree to star in this?"
dan_slentz,"Dec 25, 2019",1/10,"First.. I knew nothing about the Broadway play, so I wasn't expecting much. I knew there were some big songs in the movie.. and I knew this had an excellent cast. But I went in not really expecting much. Wow! When you expect a lot, you're often disappointed. When you don't expect much, you're often very pleased. NOT in this case! The lead actress (Francesca Hayward) was truly excellent in the role (and her dancing was beautiful), and Swift, Dench, Wilson, McKellen, Hudson, and James Corden are some of the most incredible acting talent around (and Wilson & Corden comic excellence!!) But OMG.. this movie was terrible!!! Beautiful sets, scenes, and great dancing couldn't even begin to save the hideous story and plotless adventure. It was a total YAWN-fest of boredom! If you've ever had a nightmare that left you feeling nauseous, sick, and confused.. this movie is leaves you the same way!I hate to be negative.. but this is not worth watching at all. I do want to acknowledge the production crew on excellent production values.. and Ms. Hayward for her beautiful movements.. but NOTHING (including talented actors) could have saved this train wreck!

planktonrules,"Apr 20, 2020",2/10,"I must point out first that I have seen ""Cats"" on Broadway...and I was NOT a fan. I found the story bizarre and didn't particularly enjoy the play. So, consider this when you read the review.As to the movie, it is one of the biggest disasters in recent box office memory, as the film was pretty much hated by everyone...including fans of the play. And, after seeing it, I can see why. Apart from a song here and there and the train dance number, pretty much everything about the film is terrible...especially its waste of talented and expensive stars. Many times, established stars are given songs that simply aren't good fits for their skills. The biggest example that comes to mind is Rebel Wilson....who I loved singing in other movies. Here, she just isn't that good...and it just goes to show you talented and likable stars are not going to work if the producers are out of their minds. A few other things I disliked about the film would include the creepiness of the characters, generally bad CGI (the opening scene shocked me how rotten it looked), Idris Elba looking naked (and super-creepy) towards the end of the film as well as the really creepy and awful cockroach scene.The bottom line is that this film was a chore to finish....and I found myself asking my family if they really wanted to finish the movie! It lacks fun, quality and a sound reason for being made in the first place. This film simply needs to be put to sleep."
ShanTeaTime,"Dec 28, 2019",2/10,"""Cats"" is a 2019 film based on the long lived 80's musical stage performance by the same name. It tells the story of a tribe of cats needing to decide yearly which one of them will ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back to a new life.Alright so this happened, I saw ""Cats"" even after absolutely hating the trailer for this movie. I don't need to explain why I think the human-to-cat CGI is visually terrible looking, because it is. Yes the musical has strange visuals as well, but it works as a stage performance. Why? Because were expecting oddness, we know these performers are humans dressed as cats. The key word is ""dressed"", because I fully believe that this movie would've been a lot better if the team behind it just put them in costumes and prosthetic makeup like in the musical. It probably would've been SO MUCH CHEAPER too! I don't understand what the thought process was for this, other than to try and amaze audiences which backfired horribly. So were stuck with human faces and unproportioned lips that shift due to horrible MC, human hands and feet that levitate off the ground at moments and detached looking ears and tails. It's a mess.Moving on past the CGI because I could go on all day, I will say the sets were semi-impressive considering they were actually built. Which again furthers my disbelief as to how they built actual sets but chose to CGI skin-tight catsuits onto actors, but I digress. The musical only takes place in a junkyard, so this movie expands upon the smaller feeling scale of its source material which is nice. Also the story is quite loyal to the musical, and yes there is a story. Could Tom Hooper have stretched out the story to be more suitable to audiences? Yes, but it wouldn't of been ""Cats"" then. The musical is literally a character study, going through each cat (kind of like an initiation ceremony or talent competition) so we the audience get to know them through personalized song, rather than have Munkustrap (our main narrator) describe absolutely everything. It's interesting and each of the cats does have its own personality, we also get to see the smaller plot of which cat gets to be the ""chosen one"" and be reborn into a new life.This kind of loose plot doesn't really work in a film, which is why noone asked for this to be made. I still don't know who was the intended demographic for this film, other than fans of the musical I guess? The casting is well done (for the most part) ,however some actors were clearly cast just to pull in more viewers and not for talent or appropriateness. Rebel Wilson was awful, very unfunny and didn't embody Jennyanydots's character at all, whom is weird and quirky. James Corden was pretty bad too as Bustopher Jones, though not quite as bad as Rebel Wilson. He presented the character more on point at least. The last bad fruit in the basket of the cast in my opinion will probably offend many. I couldn't stand Taylor Swift's Bombalurina performance in this. First of all, she's shown in the trailer quite a lot because she's a huge selling point, but is barely in the film (one song's worth and doesn't even return at the end). Secondly, her song sounded terrible and I think it was the worst in the film tieing with Rebel Wilson's. I couldn't tell if she was trying to impersonate a british accent while singing, or if her tone was just all over the place? Maybe both! Lastly, her CGI looked the worst to me out of anybodys. So that just pushed the illusion the film was trying to create further out the window.Everyone else either did alright or surprisingly better than I expected. Newcomer Francesca Hayward did very well and I feel awful that this is her introduction into film. Jennifer Hudson killed it as Grizabella, though I wish she would've had more screen time and they changed her approach to Victoria. In the musical she's desperately trying to have someone touch her in order to be taken back into the tribe, but in this that moment doesn't happen. Which bugged me more than it probably should have. Idris Elba did well as villain Macavity and Jason Derulo was okay, he just didn't stand a chance against the live actor though in the 80's musical film. My favorite character portrayal was Mr. Mistoffelees though, Laurie Davidson did really well and I hope to see him in more! Everyone else was kind of just alright in my opinion, they either didn't bring enough character to the roll or I just didn't really care for them to begin with. The music was faithful and for the most part sounded good so oh well, though the newly added song I didn't care for because it stuck out like a sore thumb.Honestly, if you want a true showing of ""Cats"" just watch the 80's musical movie adaptation. It's pretty good and close-up so you can see all of the details put into the performances. This movie will probably garner some kind of following, I've already seen fanfiction drawings of Victoria and Mistoffelees. Which probably resulted from this movie surfacing and pushing that ""romance"" more into the light, but it doesn't really bother me. Tom Hooper has definitely become of those directors that either makes massively successful films that acquire acclaim or real failures that people hate. Which is fascinating. If you have a morbid fascination with this film, go see it! If not don't force yourself to, you'll want to leave and regret spending money on an overpriced theatre ticket."

gmfrank212,"Dec 29, 2019",8/10,"Honestly, if you are a true theater lover / dancer you can embrace this movie. I've been a fan of Cats since a small child (talking 4 years old) - and I have also had the wonderful fortune of seeing a production live as well as performing in one as a singer and featured dancer. I felt this adaptation was pretty well thought out and executed to a great level for the big screen. It had the playfulness and musical power of the stage production (thank you, Andrew Llyod Weber, executive producer and executive music director) with all of the performers really embracing their roles and performing at an amazing level. You get so much more context from this movie and there seems to more plot line then in the original story. I loved the added dialogue to create the context - and loved the character choices of Idris Alba and the director Tom Hopper to bring Macavity more to life then in the original Broadway production. I felt every actor and actress in this version executed their characters very well (thank you to Robbie Fairchild as Munkstrap - my fave cat!)- but an EXCEPTIONAL shout out to Jennifer Hudson who embodied such a beautiful version of Grizabella! (Memory made me cry)
As far as CGI - if you can go to a Marvel movie and see Josh Brolin as Thanos and have no issue or see a ""youngified"" version of Michael Douglas then why is there such an issue with seeing performers as cats in CGI?? When I performed in the show it was leotards, wigs with Cat ears, loads of make-up and tails that swung around lifeless (while sometimes getting caught during the dancing) - at least in the movie version we get tails that are interactive.
So inconclusion, I could continue to rave about each individual character, the settings, the directorial choices, dance, etc. but I leave with: if you are a theater nerd or you are a dancer this movie is for you.DANCERS: Les Twins are featured and the Jellical Ball is PHENOMENALLY executed.But Haters got to Hate I guess....."

Really nice film, with a beautiful story"
baileycrawly,"Dec 29, 2019",1/10,"Yikes.Before anyone tries to discredit me by saying I just don't ""get"" the point of the production, you should know that I have the official broadway recording the was released. I haven't ever been to a live show but I've seen the spectacular show on video time and time and TIME again. I'm aware that it's something to behold, an event devoid of any particularly defined plot or purpose. That's the charm of the performance, after all, right?Well, yeah. But that doesn't translate to a film. A group of human beings in cheap costume with low-grade CGI prancing about without a purpose on a movie theatre screen doesn't work. It's not a performance of the broadway show; it's a feature film and in that venue it fails miserably. The talent that was employed for this production aren't showcasing their strongest efforts, the main name (Taylor Swift) was literally put in to sell tickets to the movie; her character ultimately does nothing for the film.I really don't care that there's a ""new song"" or that there's a ""big budget"" put into this movie. All the money in the world can't take a concept that works good in one medium and make it into a good film. This performance belongs on the stage and on CD. As a film it's bland and it leaves nothing but a horribly vile taste in my mouth. This movie is a real hairball, no question about it. I wanted to chase these cats away with a spray bottle. I hope I never have to endure this torturous mess again."

You have to assume the studio paid for those ones because they needed to have some good reviews.This movie is peppered with stars, so you'd think it would be good. CGI has come so far, so you'd think that would be good too. But somehow it just added to how terrible this is.The CGI is awful. The script is awful. Some of the songs that were great on stage are somehow awful. The blame lies with whoever decided not to animate this and went with CGI instead.I have never seen so many famous names in a cast and thought wow, this was a pile of poop.Wait for it on Netflix for free, it's that bad. And there were only about 30 people in my showing and 4 of them left and never returned. That's how tragic this movie is, and it's a great musical on Broadway, just so NOT in this movie. It's a razzie contender for sure."

thevylenain,"Dec 26, 2019",1/10,"I am writing this review as I am still in the movie theatre room and the movie isn't finished yet.The most disturbing thing for me is how obvious the green screen is. I can't stop starring at their feet. They didn't even try to make it look a little real. No depth of fiel, nothing. This just makes all the dancing and moving so unnatural.Some songs and voices are good but the overall movie is just really bad. I wanted to leave after 20min but my mom paid for the tickets and I don't want to be disrespectful.I don't think this should have ever been adapted for the big screen. Because of all the reasons above but I also think it's just too theatrical and just doesn't adapt well. I have no doubt this would be 10x more enjoyable played on a Broadway stage.Stay away from this movie."

eddie_baggins,"Jan 12, 2020",1/10,"Sometimes in life we all ignore that quiet still small voice inside us, that voice with wise judgement urging us to make the right decision, sadly for me I recently ignored this inner voice and my want to see what has been called one of the most downright bad film's of all time is a case of curiosity almost killing the (Eddie) cat.I, like many others had no great desire to see the cinematic adaptation of Andrew Lloyd Webber's stage musical Cats, especially after witnessing the close to frightening trailers, that for some reason decided to mould felines and humans into some form of monstrously designed evil hybrid but after all the press proclaiming the depths of despair this film sinks to, I felt it was my duty too catch it first hand.What I and other viewers are greeted with is a film so lifeless and devoid of any form of spark, that it's nigh on incomprehensible that not only Oscar nominated director Tom Hooper is the man responsible for this crime against film but that he managed to secure 100's of million in cash to make it and recruit an A-list cast to partake in its follies.How any sane person could read the Cats script and think it was going to turn out in a reasonable way is beyond me, as Hopper and his writing team lead this almost entirely song and dance experience through a plot that doesn't even pretend to have a story.There's certainly visions I will never forget, that much I can give the film, images such as James Corden lapping up delicious treats with his cat tongue, Sir Ian McKellan meowing seductively to the camera, Jennifer Hudson's runny nose and Rebel Wilson eating human cockroaches are but some glories but trying to figure out what is happening in this jellicle madness is not worth the brain power.After a seemingly never ending opening song and dance number that almost sends you off the deep end before the shows even really begun, the tale of Francesca Hayward's abandoned cat Victoria and her night out on the town being introduced to all manner of fluffy friends is two hours of pure tedium and pain as we begin to not only question the films existence, but that of life itself.The whole experience is supposed to be a fun and colorful trip to an extra ordinary feline world but despite some undeniably great costumes and set design, this family rated feature is akin to some type of Lovecraftian horror trip as we traverse graveyards, milk clubs and back alleys on our quest to find out who indeed from these cats is the most jellicle.Towards the end of Hopper's disasterpiece, Dame Judi Dench's cat matriarch Deuteronomy stares directly at the audience and proclaims about what we have all learnt throughout the last few hours, it's a bizarre ploy, a scary and uncomfortable ending to a film that needs to be seen to be believed but one that I beg you not to ever watch, let that curiosity go and don't make the same mistakes I did.Final Say -Cats is truly unlike anything we've ever seen before and I trust we will never see again.A plot-less, painful and embarrassingly bad big budget extravaganza that will live long in echelons of epic Hollywood failures.0 snooty noses out of 5"

ferguson-6,"Dec 20, 2019",4/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Director Tom Hooper must really enjoy this process. In 2012 he brought mega-hit stage musical LES MISERABLES to the screen. It was nominated for 8 Oscars and won 3, including one for Anne Hathaway. This time, Mr. Hooper again turns his talents towards a colossally successful stage musical, and costumes, make-up, and visual effects are even more crucial. Whereas Les Mis was adapted from Victor Hugo's novel, CATS was adapted by songwriter Andrew Lloyd Webber from a 1939 poetry collection of T.S. Elilot. Of course, Mr. Webber is also the genius behind other brilliant musicals, including THE PHANTOM OF THE OPERA (from the novel by Gaston Leroux).Tom Hooper and Lee Hall have adapted the screenplay from the stage presentation, and the sung-through musical approach means there is minimal dialogue. Songs are used to tell the story and introduce the key characters. Choreographer Andy Blankenbuehler (a 3-time Tony winner, ""Hamilton"") is the real star. Multiple dance styles are featured, including: classical ballet, contemporary, hip-hop, and traditional tap. The dancing is tremendous, and of course, a big part of that is Francesca Hayward, who plays new kitten on the block, Victoria. Ms. Hayward is a Principal Ballerina at The Royal Ballet. Numerous other skilled dancers are in the cast as well.The story (such that it is) revolves around a tribe of Jellicle cats who have an annual ritual of selecting one to ascend to the Heaviside Layer and come back with a new Jellicle life. Sweet Victoria is unceremoniously dumped in the alley by her owner, and is quickly surrounded by this tribe of cats that basically aren't very nice. It's in this opening sequence where we realize these humans as cats actually look a bit creepy and take a while to get accustomed to. Given the structure, the story plods along through each successive song, with certain characters getting their moment to shine. These include Rebel Wilson as humorous and chunky Gumbie cat Jennyanydots, Rum Tum Tiger cat played by talented musician/singer/dancer Jason Derulo, Oscar winner Jennifer Hudson as outcast Grizabella, James Corden as the usually-hungry Bustopher Jones, and Oscar winner Judi Dench as Old Deuteronomy. Always hovering, is the mystical Macavity played by glowing-green-eyed Idris Elba, and making a later appearance is Taylor Swift as Bombalurina, singing the Macavity tribute song.The two most memorable numbers come courtesy of Ian McKellan as Gus the Theatre Cat, and Ms. Hudson who belts out the most famous song of the production, ""Memory"", in a vocal and emotional highlight of the film. Visually, it's Mr. Mistofelees (Laurie Davidson) magic number that breaks us out of the muted palette. The other musical numbers mostly just fall flat and aren't very entertaining or enjoyable.It's pure coincidence that the screening for this film was the same day as the new Star Wars movie. The franchise for the latter began in 1977, while ""Cats"" first hit the stage in 1981. That's quite a legacy for both. As for this film version from director Hooper, I do wonder if enough viewers will respond to a musical where the story and songs are overshadowed by the dancing, and the sets and costumes offer no 'wow' factor. Many will find these characters hard to connect with ... at least outside of that incredible Jennifer Hudson vocal. It seems these kitties should have remained on stage."

amandasnarfles-41196,"Dec 21, 2019",7/10,"I don't tend to write reviews, but felt it necessary on this one.Firstly, other than knowing 2 songs, I knew nothing about the ""story"" for Cats. I soon realised, about 20 mins in, that there is no solid storyline, and perhaps it translates better on stage than the big screen. However, I loved it. The performances were amazing, I loved the dancing, and J Hud was outstanding, I was sobbing by the end. It's just one bizarre musical number after another.Secondly, the CGI really isn't as awful as people are making it out to be. Some bits looked a little off, but it wasn't distracting at all. In fact, at times, it was glorious to look at. The set designs were beautiful, and the way the actors moved was captivating.I can see why people may not like this movie, it's definitely not to everyone's taste, but it's not a bad movie by the time you judge talent and direction. I think it's the lack of story that makes it hard to follow."

BA_Harrison,"Dec 20, 2019",2/10,"Cats is way out of my comfort zone: I'm not a fan of West End musicals, I can't stand James Corden (and struggle with Rebel Wilson), and the idea of Judi Dench singing is the stuff of nightmares. However, the lure of seeing something truly terrible and then being able to write a scathing review proved too irresistible; to that end, I wasn't disappointed (plus, the viewing was free for me: I won an Unlimited cinema pass earlier in the year).Imagine all of the roller-skating locomotives of Starlight Express speeding down their ramps and flying off the stage in unison, landing in a crumpled heap in the front row, arms and legs twisted and broken: Cats is an even bigger train wreck than that. Putting aside the frankly bizarre sight of well-known performers with CG cat ears, fur and tails, the film is still 100 minutes of 'what were they thinking?' with a sprinkling of 'who the hell likes this stuff?'.A nonsensical plot (based on T.S. Eliot's 1939 anthology, Old Possum's Book Of Practical Cats) strings together the baffling musical numbers, of which there are many. The word 'jellicle' gets said an awful lot, but no-one explains what it means. It's not unlike a wild fever dream, with bizarre imagery, strange performances and lacklustre song and dance routines pummelling the senses until the final act, in which Jennifer Hudson's snivelling, runny-nosed Grizabella screeches her rendition of Memory (more painful than a cat making itself comfy on your lap) before disappearing into the sky in a chandelier suspended from a hot air balloon.James Corden is as unbearably irritating as I had imagined and watching Rebel Wilson effectively naked except for a layer of fur is hard to take. On the flipside, Taylor Swift as Bombalurina is hot despite her all-over hair, and easily the highlight of the whole sorry mess.2/10 for Taylor Swift, but I almost deducted a point for the mice and cockroaches. Human-like felines are a stretch; anthropomorphic rodents and insects are a step too far."

bxgirl-54224,"Dec 21, 2019",8/10,"This film is based on the smash Broadway musical, and I thought it stayed fairly true to that show, as I remember it. So, going in knowing that, I enjoyed it. Lots of reviews saying there's no plot, not true! There IS a plot, albeit a very simple one. The cats are vying for the chance at a new life by being chosen by Old Deuteronomy (Judi Dench) at the annual Jellicle Ball.
I will admit there were a couple of weird moments, like when Judi Dench raises her leg in the air after watching Gus the Theater Cat's performance (played sweetly by Ian McKellen). But I thoroughly enjoyed all the performances, the dancing, and the singing. Jennifer Hudson performing Memory as Grizabella will make you tear up, I don't care who you are.......
If you are a fan of the musical, you will probably like this movie. If you know nothing of the musical, you should probably acquaint yourself with it first, otherwise none of it will make sense, and you will think it's just weird.
I liked it!!!"
clair_uk,"Jun 10, 2021",7/10,"I saw Cats at the New London Theatre in the early 80s with the original cast and was blown away. Wayne Sleep even sat on my lap during one scene, I was smitten. My parents bought the gatefold vinyl and I grew up singing the songs.So when I heard it was being made into a film I was dubious. How can you recreate the glory of a stage musical like Cats? And then it was released to such bad reviews and scorn, I really didn't know if I wanted to ruin my memory of the show.But....it really isn't that bad. Yes, it's weird in places but I honestly don't know how they could have made it more ""realistic"" - it's about singing cats....I loved hearing all the songs again and I enjoyed it. Worth a look if you are a massive fan of the show."
kathleenrose39-82-885577,"Dec 23, 2019",1/10,Just awful and the blame falls squarely on the Script and Director. Except for Ian McKellen there was absolutely no interest or connection between audience and characters. The movie had no heart and there was no reason for us to like the characters. The poor actors had to work with bad choice after bad choice. The studio shouldn't throw any more money at this flop to fix the GCI. That's not the problem.
hnhnyc,"Dec 30, 2019",4/10,"I'm kind of wondering what people were expecting. This is pretty much a CGI 2020 Cats, with a few weird additional changes, some pacing that could have been faster, and some less impressive vocals. But honestly, I don't understand what was so upsetting. Has anyone seen the original? It makes very little sense to begin with! It's a musical about Cats that has honestly defied all logic for decades anyway! If you're a fan, I feel like you got what you were expecting. It was FINE. Not great, not awful. Fine. My biggest complaint was Jason DeRulo robbing the Rum Tum Tugger of literally everything that made the song and the character what it all was, but other than that, calm down. Seriously. This was not the worst 2 hours I've spent in a movie theater this year. I can name 20 movies that were more painful."

JohnDeSando,"Dec 27, 2019",N/A,"The yellow fog that rubs its back upon the window-panes,
The yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes,
Licked its tongue into the corners of the evening,
Lingered upon the pools that stand in drains,
Let fall upon its back the soot that falls from chimneys,
Slipped by the terrace, made a sudden leap,
And seeing that it was a soft October night,
Curled once about the house, and fell asleep. TS Eliot, The Love Song of J Alfred PrufrockThough these lines are not from Eliot's cat-naming Old Possum poem, they do reflect his cat preference as the inspiration of Andrew Lloyd Weber's Cats, now on film. Writer/director Tom Hooper's visuals capture the languid London of the story while the actors cannily imitate the sensuous personas of the notoriously enigmatic and elusive animal.Knowing that Eliot could not have envisioned a musical version of his whimsical poem, much less on film, it's not surprising that the musical remains even on film a mess of motifs and a thin story line. Add to that fuzzy CGI costumes and indistinct London backgrounds, it's a critically-panned production that maybe couldn't have been saved even with the magic of modern technology.Lead Francesca Hayward as Victoria is a magnetic ballerina and face, while Dame Judy Dench comes off quite well underplaying Old Deuteronomy, an ancient feline making the momentous annual decision about who will be the pre-eminent jellicle cat. Ian McKellen
as always steals his scenes, this time as Gus the Theater Cat, who appropriately laments the loss of great theater. Any cat proclaiming from London, the seat of superior theater, has the right to complain.Although there's probably more dancing than in Westside Story, the writing is not half as good. To use clichés like ""Look what the cat dragged in! and ""Cat got your tongue?"" is to seriously undermine the spirit of a pre-eminent 20th-century poet. No screenplay Oscar for this musical.Of course, the play and film count on the blockbusting ""Memory,"" sung here by a soulful Grizabella (Jennifer Hudson). Taylor Swift sings an ok ballad for her almost cameo appearance. Magical Mr. Mistoffelees is a pop-like confection that nevertheless allows actors to show their chops while giving the audience another tune to hum on their way out.Although themes of happiness coming from self-awareness and memory play throughout to unify the discursive story, Idris Elba's bad-boy Macavity is just not bad enough to lend gravity. Busy sets and sometimes lyrical song and dance can't redeem an otherwise flaccid story.If for only one of my favorite poets, I wish this play had more than one weak life, but maybe with eight more possibilities it will be worthy of Eliot and Hooper."

mysticheart327,"Apr 18, 2020",8/10,No this wasn't Broadway. Nothing can outdo that. This was a movie projection of the Broadway play with a complete set. Broadway is like reading a book and it becoming your imagination of what the set looked like. This is how Andrew Lloyd Webber saw the set. The main character is a ballet dancer in London. And one of the guys is a ballet dancer and tap dancer in London. I commend them for their talent especially his tap dancing skills. You could tell he had been tap dancing from a very early age. WOW! Jennifer Hudson singing Memories was excellent. Her singing is so soulful. Taylor Swift sings Beautiful Ghosts and I enjoyed it very much. I enjoyed it very much but you have to go in watching it as a movie not a broadway play. Two very different things.
klblynn,"Dec 31, 2019",7/10,"Although I am a big Broadway musical fan and have heard the soundtrack of Cats many times, I never knew the full plot. It was nice to go into the movie being familiar with the songs. Since I was familiar with the songs, I did note that some songs were not what they could of been, but overall they were very entertaining and even moving. During one song, I started off a little disappointed, but by the end of the song, enjoyed it very much. At a few points near the end, I got emotional and had chills. The plot line was very understandable for those who have never heard of it.
If you enjoy musicals, dance numbers, and Broadway-style solos, the movie is worth your time. It was a movie I would watch over and over and recommend to friends. Actors did a phenomenal job and obviously Jennifer Hudson was amazing. Quite a few ""new"" actors who did a wonderful job as well. Excited to see where they go in the future."

me-120-684008,"Dec 27, 2019",2/10,"I just went to see the film adaption of Cats - I think it has to be one of the worst films I've ever seen.The film itself was largely devoid of storyline and frankly quite boring. The visuals were nice but overall it was gaudy. The choreography was OK but the vocal performances were questionable.The CGI and the movements of the actors was interesting but only for a few minutes. The way the cats moved varied throughout the film (walking on two feet or four feet) and I noticed a few errors in the sizes of the cats compared to their props & scenery.All of the sung parts seemed to be recorded 'dry', without any acoustics appropriate to the setting of the scene, which really spoiled the realism for me. Sounded just like the actors were in a vocal booth, two inches from the microphone.Several people walked out of the cinema halfway through, and I don't blame them. I stayed until the end in case it got better, but it didn't."
tburgess-47726,"Feb 8, 2023",1/10,"So so so terrible. From acting, to singing, to plot, it is all so horribly bad. BUT the worse of all is the CGI and use of technology. It doesn't even come close to looking good. Things float and move around, mostly their feet, that it looks so laughable.I recalled that I had heard it was bad, but that was 3 years ago. I didn't remember the what or why was bad about. Heck, the world experienced the COVID pandemic a few months after this movie was released. Anway, I received free HBO for the weekend, saw this, and decided that I had to see it for myself. I wished I would've come to IMDb to reminded myself about the bad the comments and reviews.I'm not making a joke here: I'm honestly surprised that HBO is even showing this still. If any of these actors have any kind of self-respect, they would demand that this film is never shown again. Stay away; far away. Wear a mask and don't get contaminated by this show."
waldoborolibby,"Dec 20, 2019",1/10,"They spent a whopping $95M on this crap. Tuneless musical based on a Broadway show and starring computer generated fur stuck around the faces and bodies of some actors singing too loudly. The original choreography was dumped in favor of what the CGI could produce.The major critics have all lambasted this bomb and the awards season has pretty much ignored it. Even Judi Dench couldn't squeeze a good mention out of any of them.Critics have said the sets are ugly and the CGI flying bodies go all blurry. Even the close-ups of singers, faces framed in CGI fur, go all wonky if they move. It's like a series of auditions in close-up or even worse, cat night at your local karaoke bar.Most of the actors are (blessedly) unrecognizable but Ian McKellen, Idris Elba, Rebel Wilson, James Corden, Taylor Swift, and Ray Winstone are all in this back-ally mess."
cathblack,"Apr 15, 2021",9/10,"Not at all as bad as the critics said. Sure it's not like watching the musical but the singing and dancing is very good. The characters are a bit one dimensional but they are from a book of poems for goodness sake. Judy dench has her lovely screen presence in it. It's a perfectly watchable translation from the film, given a bit more explanation than the stage play. I prefer the mungo Jerry number in this to the musical. In short. Watch with an open mind and not based on what the critics say."

Film_star,"Dec 21, 2019",5/10,"Honestly, I don't know how expectation here ever got beyond what the project always said on the tin. Humans dress up as cats and sing a mixed bag of songs and it's sort of a fabulous hot mess. If this premise is for you, then you'll like it. If it's not, you won't. (See also: Cats the musical.)Increasingly we are allowing ourselves to be pushed towards extremes of opinion on everything, and it's ruining our ability to see the shades of truth in between. The CGI in Cats bothered me far less than De Niro's waxy face in The Irishman (a film I liked far better than this, in spite of its needless miscasting).The scale problems didn't bother me much because I just suspended disbelief. I'm watching a movie in which cats sing, so really I'm not looking for dimension realism.Jennifer Hudson belts THAT note out, and it's a bit of a moment, but I'm not sure her sobbing throughout the song was the appropriate creative choice for the lyrics. But Judi Dench has bags of cheeky fun, and Laurie Davidson is a charismatic Mr Mistoffelees.Honestly, I left the cinema feeling like I'd seen a perfectly OK movie which couldn't be a lot better because the inherent source material isn't all that brilliant.To dismiss it outright, or enjoy kicking some pretty decent performers and dancers who enter into the spirit of it, isn't an especially balanced form of criticism."

They just kept screaming, ""We're free, we're free."" We all stormed to the front counter to get our money back. Ans what do you know, they just had cardboard cut outs of CATS sitting up front.

The Emoji Movie, while obviously a big waste of time, at least had some funny moments and decent voice acting, for the most part. It also didn't make my eyes bleed from the CGI. Cats, on the other hand has no redeeming qualities. Trash music and story, as well as disturbing and nightmare fuel ""cat people""."
vinsond21,"Dec 27, 2019",8/10,"I am not a cat lover, but i love musical theater. In 1984, when Andrew Lloyd Webber's new musical Cats opened in Washington, DC's National Theater, i went to see it for the first time not knowing what to expect. I was blown away by the music, the staging, the concept. Over the years, i went to see the musical on stage three more times. And i couldn't wait to see a big-screen version that can be enjoyed by one and all, and not just those who can afford theater tickets. Finally, my dream has been fulfilled and i can die in peace. Cats the movie is pretty much what i imagined the musical on celluloid would be, with its near-purrfect casting and excellent choreography. While everyone was good in their own way, some impressed more than others. My favorite number and performer is probably Skimbleshanks the Railway Cat featuring Steven McRae followed by Mr Mistoffelees with Laurie Davidson and original song Beautiful Ghosts sung by newcomer Francesca Hayward. Also delightful with their turns were James Cordern as Bustopher Jones, Rebel Wilson as Jennyanydots and Jason Derulo as Rum Tum Tugger. A lovely surprise was Taylor Swift who wowed as Bombalurina, proving her early doubters wrong that she could carry off that role. The part of Old Deuteronomy, played by male actors in the stage versions, was given to Dame Judi Dench; she who became the first female M in the Bond franchise also did justice to this dignified role. Haters who decided not to like or love this movie before or after viewing it will find any reason or excuse to hate it. As for me, watching this Cats on the big screen left me ""feline good""."

I do not agree with the reviews of it being garbage and I am not sure why people said they were waiting for an orgy. There was nothing sexual about it. The cast was very talented but my opinion of the movie is that it was extremely boring. The costuming of the heads and faces were very unique and it was all a bit strange looking, especially the tails, but believe me, there are a lot of talentless garbage movies out there, this was not one of them."
watcher101,"Aug 24, 2021",4/10,"Well, I finally ignored the bad reviews and sat through this, and what can I say about it? Well, it at least improves over the play. Yeah, the CGI was a disaster, there's no getting around that; they tried something, and it didn't work, and unfortunately, most people can't seem to see beyond that. But the movie and story itself, an improvement in every way. First, it actually has a bit of a story. The original play, it was basically one cat after another appearing and singing about their one defining feature, and that's it. This, while it does that too, at least expands on things and gives more characters actual character rather than being a one song appearance character.The story and character of Victoria and Mistoffelees are really expanded upon, especially Victoria, who is now the main character, as is their relationship, and Macavity and Grizabella a little bit too, giving more depth to their character and investing you in them and their interest a little more rather than them just appearing for a single song and dance, and then they no longer matter. Instead, they actually take part of the plot and the overall story and have more to do with things, especially Victoria, who even gets her own song and helps out Grizabella instead of just being another background character. For example, instead of Mistoffelees' song just being an introduction for and about his character, the scene is given more depth where he's trying to gain his confidence to save the day while the others support and encourage him. It also introduced him earlier and established he was magical back then rather than have him be a deus ex machina like in the stage musical. Little details like this go a long way. They actually do the ""show, don't tell"" rule for all of the characters to show what they're like rather than the play that only sings what they're like and doesn't show it.Of course, overall the movie still isn't much of a story, but at least it's an actual story instead of one random song and dance strung together by another for something that pretends to be a story like the wayt the actual musical was, so it feels like there's actual some kind of stakes or plot to follow. When it comes down to it, story and characterization plays the biggest part of a movie, and this at least has that with some of the characters, which the play doesn't (excluding Grizabella). In the original, the only character you really feel anything for is Grizabella, but in this one, you can feel at least a little bit for some of the other characters, which is an improvement over the play.Obviously, the movie was still a flop, and the CGI did not work out, but if you compare it to the original, it improves over it in almost every way, which is at least some kind of win. Not that I'll be watching either of them again, but I'll take this over the original any day."

(The other one was for the brilliant Rebel Wilson, the only joy in the movie)
So, why did it bomb and why did I rate it so low? Easy...it's a dire film.
The music is appalling and there's nothing at all to sing along to and no catchy tunes whatsoever. That's a big fail for a musical. The 'lyrics are boring and uninspiring and tbh half the time I could not make them out anyway.
The acting is appalling. I honestly thought Francesca Hayward's 'character' had a rigid face for the first half hour as hers never changed. You can tell she's a ballerina but her posh poses had no place as a cat. She should have been taught to dumb down her posing.
The CGI wasn't very good. The sets all looked as if they were going to be great but had not yet been finished off. The very human faces were too human, they were human faces on cats' bodies, bizarre. They should have cat-ised the faces so that they suited the bodies. And boobs on cats??? Rebel is a big lass, they should have dealt with her breasts in CGI to make them more cat like.
Finally, the story was crap. It was long and drawn out at the start and then amounted to nothing.
I admit I didn't watch the final part (maybe 20 mins or so) I honestly just couldn't bare it any longer.
Conclusion: Everyone should watch this movie just to see how bad movies can actually get."

brownharrisong,"Jan 17, 2020",1/10,"Cats is a once in a lifetime movie, not since the legendary birdemic have I been so absolutely bamboozled by the cinematic catastrophe that is this film."
hbing17,"Dec 20, 2019",1/10,They ruined the original musical. This iconic piece is now trash in theaters. Music was not good either.
petervd,"Jan 2, 2020",1/10,Just a fun fact if you ignore the stupid plot and the scary ps2 faces and focus your attention on the feets of the characters (especially in the background) you can see that the cats hover along the surface. I'm pretty sure me and my friend saw a background character glitch out. Anyway a surreal experience.
hyamshah,"Feb 7, 2021",10/10,"People all say that this is a garbage movieBut I think they're also forgetting that there are ranks within the garbage movies
And THIS movie is king of garbage movies, Jellicoe cats unite!The writers knew what they were doing and I'm proud of them"
danielw-49884,"Dec 23, 2019",1/10,No waste you time paying to see this movie no even if when get out on digital o dvd. Get the Musical DVD version and enjoy CATS.
merit-29634,"Dec 24, 2019",1/10,This is absolutely stunning. This movie shows how far movie makers can go wrong. i'm literally astonished. couldn't believe this movie is real until the end. Kept asking myself is it possible? is something wrong with me? am I dreaming? or maybe i'm still dreaming... that makes more sensehats off to Tom Hooper so I can throw the hat at him
wangvcy,"Jan 5, 2020",4/10,"But really, love the musical, this movie is such an disgrace"
vvvvvv-96663,"Dec 20, 2019",1/10,A awful film to watch will give you a headache and some brain damage
Edvis-1997,"Mar 27, 2020",1/10,"Wow. Now I understand why people sometimes give 1/10 to movies. Like what was that? It was so unnecessary,uncomfortable and lame. I couldn't even understand plot. Every cat singing about being cat? It supposed to be something that would catch audience in 2019-2020? Also comedy genre? Is this for seriously?
It was so bad. Now I will have nightmares after watching this."
Eclectic-Boogaloo,"Dec 23, 2019",N/A,"But it's technically a bad musical. So its actually a pretty decent adaptation (and I've seen the musical too). The appeal of Cats is the songs and the musical numbers, and the movie did right by both.The musical numbers were terrific and the big name singers all delivered. And most surprisingly there were some really weird visuals that left me with my jaws agape. Crazy. My body was ready for anthropomorphic cats but it was not prepared for.... well, i won't spoil the craziness. All i'll say is that I've never seen anything like it."
Tug-3,"Dec 28, 2019",1/10,"""Cats"" is such a strange film. If it had taken a much, much simpler, stripped-down approach, it could have been charming and sweet. Talk about gilding the lily: the filmmakers chose to pile on the CGI, and along with it a lot of unnecessary dialog and additional ""plot"" to this paper-thin musical. The Broadway show is a silly string of funny songs with one poignant ballad thrown in; the movie strains to add an actual storyline for no particular reason.To be fair, some of the performances are just fine, particularly Francesca Hayward, who does a marvelous job with her songs and is wonderful to behold in her dance scenes. Those bright spots are few, though, with truly awful, broad, unfunny vaudeville from Rebel Wilson and James Corden. Wow, are they bad. They act like friends watching the movie will be impressed, as if they're in a high school play and need to ham it up. Will Rebel Wilson ever star in a role that doesn't feature her constantly hurting herself, doing pratfalls and smacking herself in the face?A scroll through this IMDB page shows you just how many people were involved with the creation of this film. How much money and effort could've been saved here, just approaching the light, cute source material with simplicity."
mrqqsnmv,"Mar 14, 2021",8/10,"Wish I could review the reviews. It seems there's an incredible critical bandwagon built on reviewers who expected something other than humans weirdly pretending to be cats. If you don't like the theatrical version and have never read the poems, then you probably won't like it. If you know and like both, then you'll appreciate the movie. It could've been better, especially with more dancing, but the music stays true to the Broadway and West End classic, and the newly injected plot is a nice and slightly cohesive add. It's fun, nonsensical, and a pleasant way to spend a rainy Sunday afternoon."
skittlesjack,"Jan 19, 2021",7/10,"I don't normally leave reviews but in this case I couldn't resist there is so much hate on this film! I grew up on seeing cats at London theatre and loved it, this was a good representation of cats the ending was a bit weird. Definitly worth a watch if you like the original cats!"
highvoiceroyce,"Dec 21, 2019",1/10,"Ok I know I am not the only one wondering why they decided to make the remake of this. Play on Broadway was awesome, this? Not so much. Between the border line weirdos in the audience claiming to be ""furries"" this should be rated nc-17 just for that. How many neutered crotch shots can we see in one film? ...sorry cats but you are for the dogs!"
meyercameron,"Dec 31, 2019",1/10,I didn't see this sober and neither should you. I repeatedly thought I was tricked into watching hours of video game cutscenes.
zender8584,"Dec 22, 2019",1/10,"So, I'm picturing the following scenario. Idea gets pitched to studio exec, gets greenlit based on success of some other recent musicals (Star is Born, Bohemian Rhapsody and whatnot), goes into production. OK, so far I can understand.But at some point, SOMEONE must have seen the dailies, right? At that point, it was not too late to shut it down or maybe go a different direction. What went wrong at that stage?"
arslan2k16,"Nov 27, 2024",1/10,"Rarely does a film come along that feels like a cultural misstep of epic proportions, but Cats (2019) is undoubtedly one of the worst movies in cinema history. It's not just bad-it's a baffling, cringe-inducing spectacle that somehow manages to fail on every conceivable level.The CGI is nightmarish, creating grotesque, anthropomorphic cats that are neither charming nor believable. The story-if you can call it that-is a nonsensical mess of disconnected musical numbers, with no clear direction or emotional resonance. Even the cast, which boasts an impressive lineup of stars, seems uncomfortable, delivering performances that range from awkward to downright embarrassing.From the unsettling production design to the lack of any coherent artistic vision, Cats is a disaster that defies explanation. It's not just a bad movie-it's a cinematic trainwreck that will haunt audiences for years to come. This is the kind of film that makes you question how anyone involved thought it was a good idea. Cats isn't just a flop; it's a monumental failure in the history of filmmaking."
odiebeau,"Jan 8, 2020",2/10,"This does not translate well onto film.
First half... didn't care what happened to anyone, wondered if this would be the first film I walked out of.
Second half.... became more interested in the characters and the vague storyline. Things that I hated:
Jennifer Hudson's weird beard effect.
Jennifer Hudson crying through the whole film, sing the damn song and stop with the gurning!
Ian McKellen lapping out of a bowl.
Judi Dench singing. Love her, hate that someone said ""sing it, Judi"".
The balloon ride! What. The. Hell.
In summary, the stage gave it the magic, on film it's just weird and cringey."
nelsoncamejo,"Dec 26, 2019",5/10,"People have been overcritisicing this movie like if all movies need to leave a legacy for humanity. You can simpliy go, enjoy the music and disconnect. Nothing in the movie is real (like Star Wars either) so stop criticising the human-looking cats. Jennifer Hudson's interpretation is outstanding and the cast of singers and dancers do a great job. Francesca Hayward is lovely as Victorìa. James Corden however, looked a bit disconnected from the character and was two much James Corden. The story goes fine until we have seen about 40% of it and goes down, turning too slow, then it manages to recover to have a decent second part. I don't regret it. Maybe it's because I like musicals."
Eclectic-Boogaloo,"Dec 23, 2019",N/A,"The songs are great, as are the musical numbers. Jennifer Hudson, Jason Derulo, and Taylor Swift all sing and purr-form their rears off.Only negative was a really creepy Idris Elba, who almost looked like he was going to hang cat dong.But as i hinted at in the title the film sounds great and has some pretty visuals. It also has some crazy surprises in it that I've never seen in a movie before.It wasn't a good movie. But then again, Cats isn't technically a good musical either. Its all about the songs and musical numbers. And the performers here all delivered."
phildexter,"Dec 22, 2019",1/10,"Total embarrassment, just because you can do something doesn't mean you should. I can drive with my feet, doesn't mean it's a good idea."
menny-73865,"Dec 23, 2019",1/10,"Just the think of the professional cast and the high budget that was poured into this film, made this joke even funnier.10/10 - for making me laugh so strong.Yep. Reviews on IMDB were right. I needed to verify it myself.It's like watching a long commercial break with cats promoting different products and wishing the break will be over as soon as possible.For 30 minutes, it's pretty funny. After that, not so much. Laughs are replaced with a feeling of torture. I would play this movie 100 times to my worst enemies."
lynnmearsst,"Nov 28, 2020",8/10,Loved this movie and most of the songs! The CGI was mesmerizing. The actors and performers in this movie should not have been ashamed. I finally saw it and I loved it.
halleymusic,"Nov 22, 2020",7/10,"People are hating on this for no good reason. The performances were great and the dancing was exceptional. These are some of the principal dancers from the Royal Ballet, people. If you are a dancer or a fan of dance, you will love this movie. If you hate musicals and dance, why did you watch it to begin with?"
TheHoodOfSwords,"Jan 8, 2020",2/10,"The only thing good about this movie is a couple of the songs, which are you know, not original. The reason I give Cats a 2 and Not a 1 is that I found some of the songs enjoyable. Even if they were reused. Bleh, go waste all of your 9 lives Cats."
tuckhead,"Jul 8, 2023",1/10,"I am far from an expert on musicals and my singing and dancing are subpar, but I thought Cats was ok. Not this movie but the play/musical whatever it's called with real people on a stage. This abomination gave me nightmares and I am an old dude. The story, music, and acting could have been amazing, but no one will ever know because visually the entire film is like a million fingernails scratching slowly down a million chalkboards. It was like Gilbert Gottfried singing the most beautiful song ever, the song itself is still good you just never know it because it is dressed in the worst visual effects ever. And James Corden, how is he a thing? He isn't funny, his voice is the vocal equivalent of the visual effects of this movie. I would rather put leaches on my eyeballs than be in the same universe where this doucherocket exists."
aliloupez,"Dec 20, 2019",2/10,I left halfway through. Most terrible movie of 2019!
annastoycheva,"Dec 24, 2019",1/10,Don't have the words to describe it. You just can't unseen it.
muamba_eats_toast,"Dec 28, 2019",1/10,"Thought this would be atleast hilariously bad spurred on by the terribly hilarious reviews but I assure you the witty reviews are the only entertainment involved with this film. Disjointed, dull and just generally horrific I felt like it would never end. Particularly scarring somehow even more so as the rest was the sight of Idris Elba as a cat something burnt into my eyes now nightmare worthy."
Vincentfoti,"Jan 6, 2020",2/10,"If you watched the trailer, and couldn't tell that this movie would be a steaming mug of garbage juice, then it's your fault for going to see it. I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 because at least they tried to warn you."
abdullahmohaa,"Jan 4, 2020",1/10,"Let me make it short this is the nastiest, disgusting, nauseating, loathsome, sickening, nauseous movie made in the history."
dot-shepherd-713-836966,"Dec 20, 2019",2/10,There were sparks of entertainment but not enough to to keep my interest. A few audience members walked out. I struggled not to follow.
lesley-962-26256,"Jan 13, 2021",8/10,"You can tell the true stage performers in this. There is great singing, dancing and acting by them. There are 1 or 2 of the tv/film actors that let it down a bit.
The costumes look like they have come straight from the theatre performances which I love.
If you were expecting a movie then you will be disappointed. If you are expecting a stage show XL you won't."
bierschenks,"Dec 22, 2019",7/10,"I wasn't planning to see CATS today, but the theater I went to played CATS instead of the movie I played to see. I did not see a Broadway production of CATS, but I have seen it performed live in my area and did not care for it at all. Today I was pleasantly surprised. I loved the characters of Mr. Mistoffelees and Victoria. I thought Rebel Wilson's cat was very well done. For the first time ever I got the sense that there was a story, and I was able to follow it. I'm glad I saw it and hope lots of cat lovers get out to see it."
preppy-3,"Jan 1, 2020",5/10,"I HATED the musical on stage when I saw it in 1980. There was little plot, most of the songs sucked and I was bored. The movie has some of these issues but I ended up sort of liking it. The makeup on the people wasn't that bad and everybody could sing, act and dance. Also there was some startling set designs--it certainly LOOKED great! I almost did walk out about 30 minutes in when a number with singing mice and tap-dancing cockroaches (I'm not kidding) started up but I stayed. It got much better after that. Most of the songs were unmemorable but I loved ""Mr. Mistoffelees"" and (of course) ""Memory"". Also Jennifer Hudson was superb in her role. She sang ""Memory"" so beautifully I started crying. So it's not a great movie but it's certainly not the bomb people are saying it is."
slouiserimmer,"Dec 20, 2019",2/10,"That's literally all I have to ask. What the hell did I just watch?This movie is a disaster. The CGI leaves a lot to be desired, the soundtrack is ugly, and the plot is completely altered from the original play."
jg-76191,"Dec 26, 2019",1/10,"Never have I seen anything this bad. Shame on you, hooper.
If you still have to see it - pack 3 4loko per head, because 2 is not enough."
southdavid,"Jan 14, 2020",3/10,"I'm well behind with my reviewing following the Christmas break, so I don't have much hope of coming up with anything new for one of the most critically derided films of the year . . . but let's try anyway. I have been to see the musical, staged by a reputable touring company, and frankly I hated it. This is not some reaction to the genre, I've seen a number of them, and I like musicals. But ""Cats"" is an artless, plotless, pointless show, with one half decent song and lots of hideous synthesizers that betrays its 80's inception. The film is actually better than the musical in one sense, but in many others is a garish, embarrassing fever dream.Victoria (Francesca Hayward) is a young cat tossed into the streets by an unseen owner. She meets the various cats that live on the streets of London, around the theatre district. She comes on a special night though, as tonight is the Jellicle ball when the show off in an attempt to convince Old Deuteronomy (Judy Dench) that one of them deserves to be reborn.So, I think I've already cleared up what I think of ""Cats"" the musical. The best production in the world would still be the worst choice you could make to spend your time watching and the movie is pretty far from the best production. It does have one improvement. Rather than just two hours of characters introducing themselves, there is a bit of a plot now! Idris Elba's McCavity kidnapping his rivals to make himself the most likely Jellicle choice. Smart. Like it. In terms of other positives. . . .erm . . . I suspect, if you like Ballet, you'll get something out of some of the dances. Maybe.Those meagre positives don't come close though to making up for the hideous other worldly visuals of the CGI blending of the actors with bits of cats. . . sometimes it's little better than a snapchat face-swap app. Scale of the characters varies wildly, depending on the scene and in hardly any of them is comparable to an actual cat. Corden and Rebel Wilson are terrible in their roles. Jason Derulo can at least sing, even if his character is as embarrassing and everyone else's. Jennifer Hudson steps all over ""Memory"" with an emotional performance that comes at the expense of the song.People are going a little overboard with their criticism, it's not the worst film ever. It's probably not even the worst film of the year (though I admit I'm struggling at the moment to think of one) but it is pretty awful."
cdashton-43637,"Dec 25, 2019",1/10,Title says it all. Whoever thought this idea would translate well into real life had the thought whilst high on DMT or something. Fantastic stuff if you enjoy terrifying nightmares and waking up in a cold sweat.
sadienassar,"Dec 26, 2019",1/10,This movie is just god awful. it's boring and the cgi is just pathetic. i would rather burn in the deepest circle of hell for eternity than watch this movie one more time. god if you want something actually entertaining read the reviews on this movie because they're worlds better than this movie. i am contemplating receiving surgery now to remove my eyes because of this movie.
jaswards,"Dec 31, 2019",1/10,"Not even a large can of tuna topped with catnip could fix this atrocity.
A few safety tips before going into the theater to see this.
1. Plant your entire face into a bowl of bleach, keep your eyes open (it's worth it, trust me!)
2. Buy a box of cotton swabs, soak them in gasoline and then shove as many as possible into each ear until you can't fit anymore, then use a lighter (a match will do) and light both ends.
3. If you survived all of this and your still seated at the movie, repeat steps 1 and 2 as needed."
kerry-mcshane,"Feb 8, 2021",9/10,"Watched this with an open mind after reading reviews but can honestly say i thoroughly enjoyed every minute, a must see for musical lovers."
shimotorres,"Dec 28, 2019",6/10,"I have to preface this that I never saw the Broadway musical or previous movie. I had no idea what the story line was. I was just expecting a musical about cats. So why the horrific reviews? I don't always love musicals. The songs in these were somewhat weird; I only knew of the song ""Memories"". But I thought Francesca Hayward was cute and very watchable, as well as Laurie Davidson and Robbie Fairchild. Loved the dancing and the sets. We go to movies to either learn something and/or be entertained. Did I learn anything? No, but now I know what Cats is about. Would I see it again? No. Was it terrible? No! The dancing, the sets, the cat ""acting"" and the weird story line - it was entertaining and visually impressive."
kchkjp,"Jul 25, 2025",1/10,The higher production values needed for film reveals this as an extremely thin and cloth-eared musical. The arrangements sound thin and the choroid dull. Some startling bad performances by the star cast (Judy Dench and Ian McKellen excepted). It's amazing that this actually got released. Who did they think would like it?
ag-51596,"Dec 27, 2020",5/10,"Have seen worse. I didnt fall asleep (which is a good barometer for a film). Didnt like Jason Derulo (sp) but I dont like his vocals anyway, also not a fan of Rebel Wilson or James Corden. The main chorus parts were fab (ie the stage performers) and even Taylor Swift did a fantastic job. Jennifer Hudson did murder Memories though and I wish I could un hear it. All in all I'd rather watch this again than have to sit through Avatar (which IMO is the worst film EVER!)"
idonotexist,"Oct 29, 2025",1/10,"All of the above. This is amazing fetish driven furry clustermadness (the word i wanted to use, i cannot) masquerading as a movie while being a furry play you should keep your kids away from.If you as an adult decide to brave this amazing assault on humanity, you may very well find it superbly gouging your brain out through your ears as you crawl in any direction seeking refuge from the brilliance of this production.This epic blockbuster is basically when somebody makes a casting couch movie for furries and tries to market it to the masses as something, anything, other than that. It is still a casting couch movie but without the couch or casting, so it gets a family rating because kids love cats, right.. right.. right people. Aha. Yes.1\10 i dont think even furries liked it."
Quethinks,"Aug 28, 2025",1/10,I don't know what cats is exactly it a movie yes but it seems like my sleep paralysis demons were hoping onto the silver screen one Taylor swift uncanny cat stare at a time. James corden is testing my limits again and everyone look like they crawl from the deepest pits of hell itself I hate everything about this it makes me icky and not in the good way.
