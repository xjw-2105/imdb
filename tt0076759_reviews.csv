SantiagoDM1,"Jul 27, 2018",10/10,"""A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...""Pre review:Its writing started in January 1973, ""eight hours a day, five days a week"", George Lucas said by taking small notes, inventing odd names and assigning them possible characterization... After many drafts, he finally came to a satisfactory conclusion.Then, Lucas presented Star Wars to the United Artists, but they refused to budget the film, so he went to Universal Pictures, the studio that financed American Graffiti; however, it was rejected, as the film concept was ""too strange"".Suddenly, Alan Ladd Jr -head of 20th Century Fox- appeared, a man that trusted in Lucas' genius. And that's how Star Wars became a reality.The shooting of the movie was full of mishaps, problems with practical effects never done before, a bad first edit of the movie, but that didn't stop George from fulfilling his Space Opera. Due to those setbacks, Fox Studios began to put pressure on Lucas to finish the movie. Finally, the movie was done. On the eve of Star Wars release, 20th Century Fox, George Lucas and his cast and crew braced themselves for the worse. One way or another, May 25, 1977 would be a day they would never forget...Review:Star Wars is a modern tale of mythic adventure. It follows the journey and growth of the protagonist: Luke Skywalker. His journey of discovery is set amidst a larger struggle between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance; both parties are embroiled in a civil war. The Empire is comprised of corrupted power within a small group of leaders. These sullied leaders abuse their power over the masses with impunity. It is oppression and repression of the masses. The Empire wants to destroy the hope of the rebellion to ensure the small group of leaders can keep their power...One of the most important features of the movie are the special effects. The use motion control was even superior to Stanley Kubrick's revolutionary masterpiece: ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" thanks to the creation of The Dykstraflex, the first digital motion control photography camera system developed for Star Wars on 1976. Along with an incredibly iconographic character and production design, the movie became stylistically unique.The story and the characters are original and relatable. R2-D2 and C-3PO: the astromech as the optimistic adventurer's desiring to move forward. In direct opposition C-3PO, the protocol droid filled with doubt and reservations. Luke Skywalker, the brave hero, often haunted by doubts and hopes about his future journey. Obi-Wan Kenobi, the wise master and moral guidance of our hero. Han Solo, the rebellious smuggler whose personality represents tenacity. Leia, the damsel ""in distress"", a fearsome princess and general. Finally, Darth Vader, the most iconic character in the franchise, the merciless tyrant in a black suit, representing evil and final conflict of the journey.The film score presents an emotional resonance trough a romantic 1930s Hollywood orchestral score that was commissioned for composer John Williams, who succeeded to create a haunting constellation of operatic leitmotifs.The visual composition is authentic, as Lucas wanted a nostalgic ""filtered look"" so he kept changing key lights for a ""flashing"" effect. He used a loose, ""nervous"" frame, as in newsreels. The dramatic center was displaced, deflecting the eye to background activity, which in later films would include poetically changing weather. This first film gradually turned darker, following a symbolic color scheme where organic brown and warm gold yielded to high-tech black, white, and steely gray."" This is authenticity is reflected in it's most iconic shot: the 'Binary Sunset' sequence, which establishes the narrative through-line of the story and the world it takes place in, the main value of the scene lies in how powerfully and economically it develops Luke's character: As the suns begin to slowly sink in the evening sky, he gazes towards the horizon, his sense of longing for something more is palpable. Taking things further, he goes on to squint into the distance as if he could see his new future just out of reach, and for the first time we get to see him not as a kid, but for as a new hope.Books such as ""The hero with a thousand faces"" by Joseph Campbell structured the story, The War of Vietnam inspired the battle between the Rebels and the Empire, the lifestyle of buddhist monks characterized the Jedi, real shots of warplanes made the space battles real, Kendo foreshadowed the epic lightsaber duel, Akira Kurosawa's storytelling influenced the focus on minor characters, Fritz Lang's it's iconic protocol droid and John Ford westerns determined it's soul.The fascination with filmmaking and anthropology are the components that allowed Star Wars to be compelling and human, besides being located on a galaxy far, far away.10/10"
saveliydalmatov,"Dec 30, 2023",10/10,"The beginning of one of the most legendary franchises with one of the most elaborate worlds in the history of cinema.There is no denying, even if you are not a fan of this franchise, the contribution to cinema that this film has made.A charming and memorable soundtrack combined with strong and soulful scenes gives a wow effect.It is this movie that includes a huge number of events that capture you and immerse you in history. The powerful and dramatic first half, contrasting with the cheerful and humorous second, gives a very complete and versatile film.Characters - there's nothing to say here. Darth Vader - who can compete with him in popularity among villains except the Joker? The ""kind"" characters of the film - Luke Skywalker, Obi Wan Kenobi, Han Solo and others - are known to almost everyone. And for good reason!Yes, the graphics here are still a bit weak, but after such thoughts, look at the release date - 1977, and then remember the atmosphere and elaboration of this picture and think about whether you gave the right claims to this story?And the same ""old"" special effects are still very cool for those years and the eyes are not too sore.The only thing is that because of the possibilities of that time, Darth Vader does not look as cool as in new films and animations, and fights on light swords not best. But, unfortunately, these were the conditions before.George Lucas came up with an interesting idea - to start the franchise with the 4th film. But there were conditions for that - filming the first three episodes was impossible at that time.In general, this is the beginning of a great saga that is worth watching, it is not for nothing that it is considered a classic and revered by more than one generation.My rating is 9/10. Great!"
FiendishDramaturgy,"Oct 26, 2003",10/10,"What made this the hugely successful triumph it was? Was it casting, music, imagination, ingenuity, or luck?I remember opening day at the theaters. I was old enough to remember every scene, every character, every nuance of this film; having committed it to memory forever, as if I would never again be able to see this beloved, instantly loved masterpiece.I also remember that the HIT factor of this movie was so unexpected that you had to wait literal MONTHS to get the action figures promised on the cereal boxes. The pieces were still in the manufacturing process and we had to settle for coupons promising our toys in a few months. I wound up seeing this in the theaters a grand total of 36 times; much to my mother's dismay. She loved the movie as I did, but felt I was obsessed. Today, thirty years later, sitting here writing this review, I realize how right she was. I'm still obsessed with this movie, and with the subsequent movies which followed. I wait in great anticipation for Episode 3. I'm a fan, and I don't care what other people say about Episodes 1 & 2. I don't even mind the ""prequel"" factor, as the situation at the time, dictated to Lucas which movies he would do first.See, I remember the studios saying to him that he had to choose from the three central climactic books, and trash the rest, or just trash the whole idea. He didn't exactly ""sell out,"" he did what he had to do to get his movie...his vision...out there for us to see and experience. I admired his decision then, and I admire it now. Episodes 1-3 are being filmed now, because Lucas had the clout, the money, and the patience to give us his vision...his complete vision and not just the three center books of a 9-book series. I realize that now, there are dozens of books, but at the time, there were nine. And while most of us were happy with Episodes 4-6 and would not have missed 1-3 and 7-9, I personally am so very glad he has taken it upon himself to give us his full vision. I have enjoyed each and every installment with the same sense of awe and joy as I did this one.The casting was the first triumph for this cinematic milestone. Ford is a charismatic and magnetic personality and portrayed Han with a professionalism that you'd expect from more seasoned actors. Sir Alec Guiness is an absolute joy as Obi Wan. His casting was precise and excellent in that part. Carrie Fisher portrayed Leia in a way that, up until then, had never been experienced. Most ""princess"" types before her were whining, whimpering, little snots who were incapable of anything beyond tripping and twisting their ankle in times of peril, while Fisher portrayed her character as a bold, brazen, yet sophisticated and educated woman who was aware of her surroundings and capable of defending herself and her realm with the utmost authority.And Mark Hamil. He was perfectly cast as the whining little boy who wanted more, but was afraid to reach for it. He grows up quite well on film in these three installments, and endears himself to the audience so much the more for it. But a cast member who is almost always left out of these reviews is Peter Mayhew. Chewbacca. His character, as a supporting character to Han's, was exemplary. It's not easy portraying a walking carpet, yet holding the attention, admiration, and love of virtual millions. I am VERY happy about his being cast as Chewy in Episode 3. Couldn't happen to a more deserving...or capable...fellow. Bravo! And James Earl Jones's voice being used as the voice of Darth Vader, was pure genius. His commanding voice haunted the dreams of countless thousands of star-struck children for generations to come. I also have to say that this movie would not have had the charm it does had it not been for Anthony Daniels' C3P0. He is a gift and a joy.The musical score by John Williams featured in this masterpiece was one of the contributing factors. But honestly, this movie's success was such a total surprise to everyone, including Lucas, that nothing could prepare the world for the aftermath of having witnessed this bona fide legend, first hand.The story itself; replete with sub-plot after sub-plot, rich in dialog and detail, was beyond anyone's greatest expectations. Everyone, including Lucas, expected this movie to fail. It is a timeless classic, which I will not repeat here. There are too many movie reviews giving full details of the plot, and I won't be redundant beyond what I have already said.However, that being said, there are a few points I would like to make concerning the symbolism of this endeavor. The Force is a metaphor for the psychic abilities with which we are all born. It was also a metaphor for hope and faith, dedication and commitment to the greater state of being. The Empire is said to have been a metaphor for the Germanic Nazi ""storm troopers."" While the Rebellion is said to have been symbolic of (what would later become) the NATO forces who defeated them.And then there are the effects. The effects were, in 1977, so awesome; so creative; so ahead of their time, as to ensure this movie's vast success for the next forty years. George Lucas enjoys an almost god-like status among sci-fi/fantasy fans worldwide.This movie does not rate a rating. Usually, when I say that, it is because the movie is so bad, or disappointing that I don't have the heart to rate it.But in this case, it far surpasses any 10/10 rating I could give it.The Fiend :."
mentalcritic,"Mar 31, 2003",N/A,"I was actually born about a year after this film first premiered, but being a member of a family that was the first on the block to get such things as the VCR and the proper Hi-Fi system allowed me to catch this film in a number of different formats in the years ranging from 1982 to 1997. I think it is safe to say that without this film, I would have had no idea how truly evil a thing Pan And Scan is, or why multi-channel audio is such a damned important thing to have in the home theatre environment.Of course, I also knew that the film wasn't perfect. I could see a number of small problems where Lucas' budget just didn't quite go far enough, or where there just wasn't enough time to accomplish what was wanted. So when the announcement was made that in 1997, each film would be presented with improved special effects and footage that could not be integrated in the original cut for reasons of budget or practicality, I was excited.For the most part, I was overjoyed to see the new footage or effects. Mos Eisley now looks like a real city or port of commerce, without the viewer's sense of disbelief at the seemingly deserted streets needing to be suspended. The flight of the X-Wings towards the Death Star in its original form was very good, a marvel of its time, but when George finally got to show it the way he wanted to, it was almost the equivalent of watching the helicopters of Apocalypse Now decimating the village to the tune of Ride Of The Valkyries. The wonderfully composed tracking shots especially made the battle look almost as if it really happened and Lucas was just there to take pictures. And Jabba? Well, he doesn't look all that real, granted, but it was just nice to have that one piece of footage in order to make the appearance of Boba Fett in Episode V and the entire prologue of Episode VI make a bit more sense, especially to dullards.Unfortunately, there are a number of times when Lucas just goes too far in his quest to improve his work. Sometimes you can only do so much to anything before it starts to look overdone. Of course, I am talking about the scene between Han and Greedo in the cantina. In the original version, we are led to believe Han is a scoundrel who only cares about himself, giving us one of the best character arcs in the whole trilogy. It is also a great tribute to Sergio Leone, a nice reference to when Tuco shoots a potential assassin from his bathtub and tells the corpse ""When you have to shoot, shoot, don't talk!"". Modifying this scene so it looks like Greedo shot first is an insult on a few levels. It insults Greedo as a character, making him look like one of the most incompetent bounty hunters in the galaxy. It insults the audience, who even at the age of six should no that you'd have to be blind, drunk, brain-damaged, or all three, to miss from that distance. Lastly, it insults the character of Han Solo by destroying a vital piece of said character arc. Watching Han go from scum to a leader of men, a space-age version of King Aragorn even, was one of the best things about the original Star Wars trilogy.The story itself is the stuff of classics in that it shows the most unlikely of heroes doing things that everyone else claims to be impossible. What Lucas got right in terms of pacing and plot here is exactly where he went wrong in the prequels, in that he makes the jump from location to location seem important to the plot and totally natural, rather than forced and choppy. The story and sense of adventure makes one forget that there are really only three major locations other than the inside of a space ship.Overall, the original Star Wars rates an eight out of ten. If Lucas had applied some common sense in conjunction with his rampant desire for revisionism, I would give it a ten, but as one critic who is famous for his negativity once said about Episode II, when was the last time anyone told George Lucas no? Still, this is a classic that should be shown to future generations as an example of how an imagination and enough literacy to realise it will open doors for you when nothing else will."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 18, 2023",10/10,"The Empire look set to continue their relentless war effort, new technology means they are pretty much unopposed, but a small band including Like Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo, look to fight back.I'm not sure what I can add that hasn't already been said, instead I'll try and imagine what it must have been like for someone, someone young perhaps, heading to the cinema in 1977, seeing this film for the first time.Consider what had gone before, people had Star Trek, and various other shows, but this film must have left audiences speechless, as there was quite literally nothing else like it.This film changed not just sci fi, but film making in general, the sheer scale and imaginative of it shame many of today's mediocre offerings.You have to admire the sheer bravery and audacity to get this film made, you wonder what doubts George Lucas had, he must have been elated when audiences turned round and fell in love with it.It's funny, entertaining, exciting, jaw dropping, moving, it's everything you want from a movie, years on, it's still a masterpiece.10/10."
davidsarah,"Dec 12, 2004",10/10,"Star wars made epic fantasy real. For a generation of people it has defined what the cinema experience is meant to be. Today it is probable that pc games will offer a deeper and more satisfying entertainment solution, but for pure visual and aural pleasure, mixed with basic emotional manipulation, there has never and will never be a better example of cinema than when star wars appeared over 25 years ago. When you think of star wars, you must remember what else was happening at the time. In America, the war in Vietnam had been lost. In the U.K economic disaster was occurring(a 3 day working week, and the army collecting rubbish). It was almost like the two most technically advanced countries in the world were going backwards. Star wars let everybody escape from that reality and reach for a future that was uncertain but ultimately good."
UniqueParticle,"Jan 16, 2020",10/10,"Only seen the original Star Wars films a few times, I tend to forget how great of a magical experience it is! A New Hope is so awesome in so many aspects especially the music and sounds of everything! It's amazing how it was made for it's time I still I don't understand how they did many things. I will admit it has a few bits that are boring but still glorious. Up until a few years ago I didn't see most of the films and I didn't understand the hype now I do in which I'm happy with them all even seen the new ones."
Sfpsycho415,"Oct 22, 2003",10/10,"I can never pick a favorite movie because different movies have different effects. Goodfellas is my favorite drama. Face/Off is my favorite actioner. But when it comes to pure amazement, nothing beats Star Wars. We are introduced to a whole other universe with different creatures, different lifestyles, and different history. We are dropped in the middle of an intergalactic war between an empire and a rebellion that has raged for years and left the universe in ruin. It was the most fascinating thing to see when i was eleven, but to this day i am still a Star Wars nerd.The cast of characters includes some of the coolest, funniest, and most tragic in film, and the actors who play them fit seamlessly into this new universe. Alec Guiness is flawless as Obi-Wan Kenobi, a Jedi on the run from the evil Empire. Harrison Ford is awesome as Han Solo, a smuggler and thief who helps the gang rescue the princess. But the my favorite character of all time is Darth Vader. Not only is he the coolest bad guy, but we learn in later films why he is evil and start to feel sympathetic for him. Not to mention that badass booming voice that can make ordering a pizza sound threatening.This was not only the beginning of the best movie series ever, but it was the beginning of my love for movies. George Lucas is a genius for being able to come up with a great story and an incredible backdrop for what was supposed to be a flop, but turned into one of the best films ever.10/10"
Bogmeister,"Dec 25, 2005",9/10,"Though now known as ""Episode IV-A New Hope,"" for many of us, namely those of us who first saw this exhilarating entertainment in theaters back in '77, this will always be the first ""Star Wars."" We will always think of it as just ""Star Wars"" - plain & simple, no pretensions, no aspirations to deep film-making or high art. This is where we first met them all: Luke, Han Solo, Princess Leia, Obi-Wan Kenobi (old 'Ben'), Chewbacca, the 2 robots C3PO & R2D2 and, of course, Darth Vader. They were instant pop culture icons; you got the sense you'd seen them before somewhere, but were sure this wasn't possible. But they'd been there before in our minds. We'd read about them constantly in science fiction novels and short stories - tales of outer space civilizations, of spaceships zooming through asteroid belts, of exotic-looking aliens hanging around space ports. We'd dream about them at night and try to imagine ourselves in their midst; up until then, we could only imagine such things - there were no projected images to realize such dreams. ""Forbidden Planet"" from 1956 came close, and then there were the ""Star Trek"" and ""Lost in Space"" TV series, both hampered by dime store budgets and cheesy sets. We ate 'em up since there was nothing else. Then Lucas made it real.I remember when I first got wind of the upcoming movie, to open in May of 1977, I think. I saw the first publicized poster and bought the novel adaptation. On the poster, a young man stood with some light sword raised, a princess at his feet, numerous spaceships flying all over the place. I was in my mid-teens and felt the first pulse of building excitement as I realized all those fantastic tales I'd been reading the past few years were going to come alive on the big screen for me. It didn't disappoint. Luke Skywalker, who stood in for all the boys pretending to be on a galactic adventure, gets swept away from his mundane desert home smack dab into the middle of an honest-to-gosh galaxy-wide civil war! The strength of the narrative is / was amazing. There are no slow spots and you can't wait for the next scene during the entire experience; and, experience is the better description for it, rather than just 'movie.' You can't wait, for example, for the moment when Luke actually meets the princess; what will happen then? It's a textbook case of an exciting narrative and what I believe makes this superior to all the sequels (knowing that many feel ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is superior - I must disagree).The one character you really can't wait to see again is the ominous Vader, naturally. The instant he steps into view during the first few minutes of the story, you just know this is the ultimate villain. This is the baddest of the bad, the coolest of the cool, the supreme uber-evildoer of the entire galaxy. You just know it by his stance, by his attitude, and by the electric chill that runs through your frail form as he steps down the corridor, moving into the annals of film history with one fell swoop. You can't wait to see what he does next, what nefarious action will send someone or some planet to its doom. Sure, he seems under the control of Tarkin (Cushing) here and later, the Emperor, but you just know he's simply biding his time until he takes over the whole damn universe. There is no precedent for Vader, and nothing close to him after. He's at his best here where there's still much mystery attached to his dark frightful form, a minion of Satan and Nazi stormtroopers all rolled into one.This was also the movie-experience which catapulted Harrison Ford (Solo) into superstardom. He seems almost childish here, not really straining to create a character, and it's this flip charm that makes it work, against all odds. He really does appear to have stepped out of the pages of some juvenile space opera, laser guns blazing, all snide remarks and foolhardy bravado. But he also becomes the older brother figure to Luke, who cannot carry the story by himself. Hamill, whose movie career began & ended with Luke, epitomizes the center of destiny for a galaxy. Both humble and arrogant, he's perfect in the role. Fisher's main surprise is that she's not all sugar and sweet as one would expect of a princess. These three characters evolved in the next two films, but they were always at their best here, icons given life for a short period - but also forever in film. The same could be said for Alec Guinness as Kenobi, a first class act all the way. You almost believe this elderly warrior could topple an empire, given enough time. Unless he runs into Vader..."
gregmovies,"Sep 1, 2008",7/10,"Filled with great characters and a fun story, Star Wars is well deserving of its reputation as a classic. John Williams score alone makes this a film worth seeing. The characters are unforgettable and the special effects impressive for its time, but very outdated now. The different alien species are one of the best things about the film. The Cantina scene showing an array of Lucas' creations is particularly fun.I give this film a 7/10. Looking at it subjectively, it isn't a really good film. A lot of clichés, bad dialogue, cracker jack philosophy, and unimpressive acting. Yet, for some reason, I find it hard to say anything bad about this movie. My favorite film as a child, and one I still enjoy, mostly for nostalgia."
Anthonyjkb,"Nov 19, 2018",10/10,This movie is a cinematic masterpiece that will be loved forever. The special affects are so good for 1977 and the soundtrack for this movie is amazing.
tagerjd,"Jul 24, 2016",6/10,"Star Wars Episode 4 A New Hope tells the story of a farm boy Luke Skywalker who upon his purchase of two droids R2-D2 and C3-P0, and running into the old and wise Obi-Wan Kenobi he is thrown into a world bigger then his own.A New Hope has great sense of pacing and having a flowing narrative build up to its conclusion almost flawlessly. The characters feel like real people with fleshed out motivations. The effects although aged today definably inspired what we have today in the art of cinema. The score just like all the other films in the saga is fantastic. But what this movies greatest feat is just how much it inspired a generation of cinema, as well as is outstanding impact on pop culture that keeps this film fresh.In spite of how much we can all appreciate this movies impact it is still far from a perfect movie. Most of the acting is hooky, and the effects are hard to by today. And although it has a good sense of pacing it still has many plot conveniences. The action is also pretty slow which prevents it from feeling like a real fight is going on. Even the dialogue is pretty hooky and hard to by. This is a problem because if characters are unable to talk like people do it makes it hard to relate to them and get invested in there conflicts.In conclusion I can appreciate its impact on culture, as well as love the movie. I personally consider myself to be a Star Wars fan. Keeping in mind that I feel on an objective level I consider this picture to be above average instead of great I'm giving this one a 6/10."
beefandbroccoli,"May 24, 2008",5/10,"I wanted to like this film and I had created memories about how good it was when I saw it 20 years ago. But after seeing it again as an adult, I found it really really tedious. The special effects were still good for that time and absolutely does not distract from the film. What made this movie awful was the dialogue ... George Lucas simply cannot write decent dialogue nor can he write jokes and it shows painfully over and over again.The pacing at Tatooine was too slow. A lot of doing nothing and that's fine but then it would need more interesting camera angles. I can't really blame them for this because it was something no one had done before."
hmorales,"Dec 3, 1998",N/A,In respect to the many kids of the seventies. I rated this movie as one of the greatest movies ever made. I was thirteen and enjoyed this fantasy getaway more than I could count. Like many other kids of the seventies you left reality before walking into the theatre and escaped into the adventure once the reels begin rolling. It provided the special effects and excitement a kid was looking for. Even today when I watch this movie on VHS I recall those times. Whenever I get the chance to watch it I feel like that eager thirteen year old over and over again. I hope the new movies will meet the same expectations of kids of  this decade and the next.
budmassey,"Apr 25, 2005",10/10,"Here begins the greatest cinematic epic of all time, and arguably one of the greatest stories ever told. Originally conceived as a serialized popcorn movie in the manner of the old action movies that Lucas grew up with, Star Wars surpassed even George's keen and bombastic imagination to become a central part of movie history.There are countless tales of the making of this movie; how Lucas never believed he would get the chance to complete the series, how it spawned an industry and made the name of nearly everyone who touched it a household word. But what that does not reveal, nor do the much diminished prequels, is the sheer joy and excitement these movies generated.It was a once in a lifetime experience. You could feel it from opening day, earlier if you paid attention to such things. We had never seen anything like it, and we are not likely to again.This episode finds young Luke Skywalker yearning to leave the agrarian life he has with his aunt and uncle, and chase after adventure as his friends before him have already done. And what adventure there is. The galaxy is in the grip of a massive rebellion against a tyrannical and oppressive empire, but on Luke's home planet, it's something you only dare speak of in a whisper.Along come two robots, ""Droids"" for short, who inadvertently involve Luke in a stellar attempt to contact an old wizard named Ben Kenobi, who lives in the caves near Luke's home.The rest is history, and there isn't a person alive in the civilized world who doesn't have at least some awareness of the epic story that unfolds. Luke's rise from adolescent obscurity on Tatooine to a leading role in the greatest struggle of all time is told with humor, action, adventure, and always a sense of story that is unmatched on the screen or on the page.With the completion of the prequel trilogy, these films are enjoying a renewed popularity among a generation that never saw the films on the big screen, and the theatric revivals are almost guaranteed. Go. Get some popcorn. And may the Force be with you."
Laz75,"Feb 1, 2000",10/10,"There's not much to say about this movie this is *THE* movie that changed it all.It's my favourite movie, and not only among the quadrilogy, among all movies; it has everything that can be great in a movie, great characters, great story, great sights, great special effects (they don't show 23 years) and a mythological background that made us dream for decades now, and that'll keep us dreaming for a long, long time. Maybe the characters I liked most in this one are Old Obi-Wan Kenobi, wonderfully portrayed by Alec Guinness, and Han Solo, Harrison Ford's first important role, they're both great.Not to mention John Williams' wonderful score, without of it, the movie wouldn't have been this great it's a perfect mix, that's what it is!"
jay_amer,"Jan 1, 2018",10/10,"This movie when I first saw it as a kid absolutely amazed me and put me into a world where I wished I could be! The story is absolutely genius, the characters are amazing! Everything about this movie is amazing! George Lucas made an absolute masterpiece of a film!!!!! May The Force Be With You!"
owenmul,"Mar 27, 2015",9/10,"Star Wars is simply a fantastic film, on every level this film is amazing.Each of the characters in this film are so well developed and so interesting that you just cannot wait for the next scene with them in it, the interactions between the characters us at times tense and at times downright hilarious, leaving no room for boring or lacking dialogue. The particular stand outs in this respect I feel are: Han Solo, the wise cracking bounty hunter with a tendency for arrogance that makes every scene as entertaining as possible. Secondly there is Darth Vader, who is the optometry of cool, scathing evil who poses as the ultimate villain.Surprising to me, the cinematography and special effects have held up all this time. Although there are some minor issues, one particularly notable one is during the scene where Luke is training with the training droid aboard the Millennium Falcon there are a few frame skips where Luke extends and contracts his lightsaber. Other than this though, the cinematography and special effects are amazing to have held up, particularly the shots of the Empire's space fleet moving through space which are absolutely stunning.One of the things that absolutely makes this film for me is the magnificent score, composed by John Williams. This score, while being one of the most iconic scores of all time, manages to make every single scene, fitting the mood of the scene perfectly.The story as well is fantastic, there is never a dull moment; every second of it an absolute thrill ride. Whether its the attack on the Death Star or the Cantina of Mos Eisley the story takes you through the twists and turns of this classic space opera.If I could recommend one sci-fi adventure film to someone, it would be this, it's an absolute must see.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/"
paul_m_haakonsen,"Dec 31, 2015",10/10,"Having grown up with the ""Star Wars"" trilogy, then ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a classic in every sense of the word. This is the epic story of good vs. evil and of light vs. dark. But it is also a story of heroism, bravery and adventure. I am an fan-boy, yes, but what is there not to love about ""Star Wars""?George Lucas really managed to piece together a timeless classic that stands its own even today. And even with effects from 1977 it was light years ahead of its time, no pun intended. And the effects stand their ground even by todays standards.There is something uniquely amazing about the atmosphere and feel of the ""Star Wars"" universe. And it doesn't require much to be swept away and carried along to a galaxy far, far away...The cast in ""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" did a good and memorable job with their individual roles and characters. And with this movie George Lucas established some characters that instantly became well-known and well-loved.""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is a movie of high space adventure with vibrant characters, creatures and spaceships.

TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 22, 2009",10/10,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here). Carrie Fisher was a fine Princess Leia, spunky, beautiful and sexy, and Mark Hamill was a completely likable Luke. And the villain Darth Vader, without doubt one of the best and in-depth villains in cinematic history, and James Earl Jones's deep booming voice was perfect for the character.All in all, a definite sci-fi classic, that blew me away. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

As I have aged, my tastes have changed and I cannot turn a blind eye to the problems but it's still a fun ride all these years later.The good:Special effects.Pacing.The bad:The acting is pretty rough in this one if we are being honest with ourselves. I think Leia is probably the best of the bunch and that's not surprising since Carrie grew up in the business.After my viewing it was clear to me that this movie was targeted at 10-14 year olds and just happened to be a smash hit that crossed age barriers. What can i say ---- I like a bit of nuance in my storytelling.It does succeed in having an efficiently told story that is logically consistent ---- but --- that's something we should expect a movie to have, no?It's showing it's age but it certainly did capture the imagination of millions."
Stenian,"Dec 14, 2020",5/10,"Star Wars has a very basic and standard plot if you really think about it: A bunch of good guys are on a mission to rescue the princess and save the universe from a bunch of bad guys, who work for the main evil villain, Darth Vader. A simple and cliched film really - Avatar (2009) of the 1970s, as the predictable story goes.The plot is very generic. That said, the film gave us a beautiful universe of its own with unique alien characters/races, planets and other material (such as the Rebels and the Empire) that became more developed and intriguing in the latter films/books/shows/etc. Not to mention that the thematic score by John Williams was phenomenal.I see this film as a starter pack or an introduction for those who want to get into the 'Star Wars' universe. But does this mean that it should be regarded as one of the greatest films ever made? Not really. I mean, the first Fast & Furious (2001) film wasn't well received, but yet its 5th and 6th films had universal praise.So yes, you can be the first film in a franchise and not be seen as the best of the bunch. And this would apply for 'Star Wars' in my bold opinion. You can watch it for reference and see how it all started, but I wouldn't bestow it with all the rave reviews.Compared to other Star Wars film (yes, even the dreaded prequel trilogy), this one seemed rather campy and, dare I say, more of a satire of Star Wars (Han and Luke acted like typical 1970s twerps). It just didn't have depth and the seriousness that the latter films possessed. I felt as if the characters are one dimensional and frivolous. Only Alec Guinness's Obi-Wan was respectable, developed and had depth.Say, if no Star Wars films were made thereafter, this film would be forgotten - You may probably find it in such lists titled ""70s Films That Time Forgot"" or something. Because, I believe, the sequels, the prequel trilogy, the books, the SW fanbase, etc and etc, made this film as famous as it is now.If it weren't for the Star Wars fanbase and growing universe, this would be just another 1970s science fiction film that many people had forgot about, albeit on the innovative side. But definitely not the greatest film of all time. So yes, watch it for the innovative concept and the music."

The fairytale wrapped up as SciFi rewrote the cinema handbook for this type of movie. > The sequels lived up to the promise but will the prequels still catch the imagination 20 years later?
tomasg-69814,"Oct 28, 2017",8/10,"George Lucas was exhausted - and had lost several pounds - when his finished work finally was to be shown to the public officially on the big screen.The recordings had been very troublesome, and was on a budget shoestring until the end. (Did it stop at 11 M $ ?) In 1977 the movie landscape was very well mixed, but It lacked Space Adventures who was far out there.Spielberg's ""Close Encounter"" from the same year did not speculate in fantasy as deep as Lucas' adventure; here we got a whole table of pure imagination and creativity from a guy who just wanted to show us the eternal battle between good and bad, dark and light, his way.And by 1977's standards and special effects options of the era: What an enjoyable classic!It's an adventure who has a good mood from start to finish. Great locations, great humour, great acting.Don't want to cherish the old trilogy in front of the ""sequels"", but it brings heck a lot more charming and warm feeling re-seeing those 77- 83 flicks.I leave it that way......""Star Wars"" is probably one of the 10 most important movies of the 20th century."
bkoganbing,"Sep 20, 2010",10/10,"The awesome special effects and the creation of creatures that are part of the vivid imagination of George Lucas are not the reason for the enduring popularity of Star Wars and the franchise it spawned. Rather it is because of the characters Lucas created that will live as long as we have cinema and the means to display it.The spectacle is behind some real, but simple people. No shadings of gray in the first Star Wars we know without any doubt who the heroes and villains are of this piece. On an isolated planet a galaxy wide dictatorship called the Empire and the revolt against come to wear young Luke Skywalker as played by Mark Hamill and his family reside. So does Alec Guinness, a reclusive and mysterious hermit.An escape pod crashes there with two androids, C3PO and R2D2 and in the latter is a message for Guinness who was at one time a Jedi Knight, fiercest of a warrior class, from Carrie Fisher playing Princess Leia. Also in R2D2 are the schematics for the Empire's ultimate weapon the satellite size death star that can deal killing out on a planetary scale.This starts an adventure with young Hamill who teams up with futuristic soldier of fortune Harrison Ford as Han Solo and his simian like sidekick Chewbacca to rescue the Princess and defeat the Death Star.Those are the good guys. The bad guys are the blackest of black villainy. Peter Cushing cold bloodedly commands the Death Star, but the mysterious Darth Vader, clad in black with a helmet completely covering his head, has mysterious powers and even his superiors are wary of him. The voice of James Earl Jones is unforgettable as the black prince of the galaxy.These are characters that bring out the kid in all of us. The ones who claim the most sophistication in their lives will cheer on for Hamill and Ford and will be fascinated by the double dyed villainy of Darth Vader.Perhaps the most interesting aspect of Star Wars and I speak now of all the films is the way such non-humans as the robots and Chewbacca the Wookie became characters. C3PO had dialog, but R2D2 had a few clicks and bleeks and all Chewbacca did was grunt, still they became as identifiable as the human characters.Star Wars set the standard for science fiction films to come for the next several generations. It was given six Oscars in a bunch of technical categories and it's got a re-release value that Gone With The Wind used to have.The Force Will Be With Us Always."
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 29, 2013",10/10,"This story happened 'A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away'. The galaxy is under the dictatorship of the emperor. Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is part of the rebellion but is capture by the evil Darth Vader. Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) the young hero, Han Solo (Harrison Ford) the brigand, his sidekick Chewbacca, and the wise master Jedi Ben Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) must together rescue the princess and save the galaxy.The characters are icons pulled from classic storytelling like Akira Kurosawa's ""The Hidden Fortress"". George Lucas was able to assemble such iconic characters into a well told story. Rarely is a movie change the nature of movie-making, and even the wider culture. This may be on the list of the most important movie ever. It changed the tone of movies from the gritty morally-confused 70s to the popcorn selling blockbusters that are soon to come."
MaxBorg89,"Nov 15, 2005",10/10,"This great classic has so many good elements it's almost impossible to list them all: The breathtaking visual effects, still awesome 28 years on; the brilliant script, which mixed epic battles and duels with matinée-serial-style characters and dialogues; the debut of one of the greatest villains in cinema history, Darth Vader; John Williams'amazing and unforgettable score, among the Top 10 best scores ever...All those things are just some of the reasons Star Wars is among the best movies (not just sci-fi) ever made: viewing after viewing, it never stops being impressive, and words are nearly useless to describe the impact it still has on the audience.George Lucas basically took a medieval story and moved it to a distant galaxy, on weird and fascinating planets. Almost everything is taken from the Middle Ages: there are knights, sword-fighting, evil Empires, unsatisfied people who want to overthrow the system, beautiful princesses waiting to be rescued...Then we've also got speeders, light-sabers, peculiar (and, in the case of Jabba the Hutt, disgusting) creatures, the Death Star, and of course the Force, that fascinating energy which is supposed to bring balance to the galaxy.The cast is a gas, both the newcomers and the veterans: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher and Harrison Ford are great as Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia and Han Solo (Ford in particular is hilarious as the arrogant but ultimately nice ""scoundrel""), but the most memorable performance is of course Alec Guinness'portrayal of Obi-Wan Kenobi, the old, wise Jedi who returns one last time to initiate Luke to the mysteries of the Force.But let's not forget what everybody immediately thinks of when Star Wars is mentioned: Darth Vader. Feared by his opponents as well as his servants, this completely emotionless foe has become the very symbol of Lucas'masterpiece. He's one of those movie-characters people will remember as long as films will keep being made and his unsettling breathing noise still echoes in our memories...The beginning of a wonderful saga, whose only rival is The Lord of the Rings.May the Force be with you..."

Kingslaay,"Feb 20, 2018",7/10,"When Star Wars came out in 1977 there was nothing like it, it came out of nowhere and was so different. It is indeed a product of its time and would have fascinated many kids of the era.As a film it is very simple and easy to follow. There are no big twists, dilemmas and the good forces come on top. The special effects and film have definitely aged but it has some classic elements. Darth Vader, the army of storm troopers and the mighty light saber is unlikely to be forgotten. Star Wars as a franchise clearly benefited from coming out at the right time, this was the day before competitive television, streaming services or films like Inception.The immortality of Star Wars lies in its simplicity, linear story and vast imagination. This appealed to millions of kids who grew into adults who still loved identified their childhood with this series."
cartesianthought,"Dec 22, 2015",6/10,"At it's time of release, it was really progressive and an influential classic, but it's quite average when judging it by its enduring quality. For what it's worth it's entertaining, the costumes are well done and it's good fantasy.Technology ages fast. The script is average, the acting isn't particularly well done and the characters aren't deep, the story is simple and there aren't a lot of human emotions on this one. It did successfully introduce the franchise so that the later and better entries could build on it. But I'm calling it over-hyped on this one (sorry). Maybe I just had to see it when I was 11 years old (or have grown up in the 70's) to see what Star Wars fans adore about this one."

leonardogrump,"Oct 5, 2018",N/A,"Film History began with A New Hope in 1977 and to this day its effects are being felt in Hollywood. Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga."
jdberkley,"May 17, 2006",10/10,"Having read a lot of the other comments here, I have to say it's interesting to see how many people begin by saying how old they were when they saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time(Full disclosure: I was three. My parents saw it at a drive-in theatre, and all I can remember of that experience was seeing Darth Vader for the first time, and knowing that he was very, very bad). I think that speaks to its extraordinary impact. ""Star Wars"" was an event, I suppose in the way that the Beatles on Ed Sullivan for the first time was an event. It dates you, to a degree, but the reason it was important-- the reason it remains important-- is that it showed you what was possible. For much of the 1960s and 1970s, filmmakers had concentrated on showing us the brutal, heartbreaking truth of our world(The Godfather, Chinatown, Nashville-- some of the best movies ever made), and many of them succeeded brilliantly. But there's a place for dreaming dreams of things that have never been, too, and ""Star Wars"", with its epic tale of an Empire and a rebellion in a galaxy far, far away, was the dream a generation didn't know it wanted to have until George Lucas gave it to us.Is it juvenile, at times? Simplistic, even? Sure. So's the truth, sometimes. We want to believe there's a Force, and that Luke can master its use in time to defeat the forces of darkness. So we believe it. Are the effects a bit dated now? Sure, although I still believe them. Did the success of ""Star Wars"" possibly kick off the modern blockbuster era, which gives us more and more special-effects-drenched dreck every year? Sadly, it probably did. But the thing the wannabe heirs of ""Star Wars"" usually lack is the one thing that made ""Star Wars"" such an event--courage.Back in 1977, nobody was making movies like this. Nobody thought a film like this, with its mythic storytelling arc and its sweeping vision of intergalactic war, could possibly work...with the exception of George Lucas and his fellow filmmakers.I didn't know all that at the time, of course. Like I said, I was only three. But having watched more movies than most people my age now, I feel comfortable saying that in its way, ""Star Wars"" is as much an independent auteur's film as anything by John Cassavetes or Woody Allen-- it has the same sort of daring, the same desire not to settle for less than showing us something we've never seen before. A bold, grand sense of old-style craftsmanship infuses everything in ""Star Wars"", and the film delivers on the promise contained in its subtitle. At the time, it really was a new hope."
mweller,"Oct 28, 1998",9/10,"Star Wars is a movie that has had great social impact, a fact that has often gone unnoticed.  A harbinger of a changing mood within the United States, Star Wars was one of the few movies rated General that was released in 1977. Where movies had for a decade been depicting ever more dark topics (Taxi Driver, The Exorcist) Star Wars was a lighthearted adventure.  While some may decry the move back to swashbuckling from social comment, I for one celebrate the fact that Star Wars made it possible for families to go to movies together once again."
Prichards12345,"May 22, 2006",10/10,"I first saw this film on a warm March Sunday evening in 1978, after queueing for a whole hour to get into the cinema. Oh, the anticipation! The excitement! The magic!

ANYTHING was possible, wonders could be achieved. Miracles in the here and now. And how lucky I was to share in it.To the squares that loathe it - I pity you daddyos; you'll never experience what millions of us have felt these past three decades. Go and see Henry Jaglom again; I'll stick with Mr. Lucas - he is THE MAN!I love this film. Forget what flaws it has - minor they are indeed. Star Wars has become a mystic myth and that sorcerer supreme, Jedi master George Lucas, has given me more pleasure than I can measure. My favourite bit? Almost impossible to choose. Okay, if I must...the stunning Tie Fighter battle with the Millennium Falcon, a work or art in the editing room.

DaveInTheCave,"Dec 27, 2011",9/10,"Star Wars is great cinema. One of the great things about it is the visuals, the opening shot where the Star Destroyer flies over while chasing the Rebel Blockade Runner is amazing. The music is also fantastic, it evokes early epic movie scores by the likes of Erich Wolfgang Korngold and Miklos Rozsa and also hearkens back to Classical music in the romantic period, especially to Wagner and Holst. The characters and story are somewhat basic but that's part of whats great about the movie, it has an archetypal, mythic quality.Some have said that the only reason this movie is highly regarded is because of people who as as children and idolize it for nostalgic reasons, well as someone who saw for the first time at the age of 16, I can attest that it's stands on it's own very well.It does have a few flaws. The dialogue can be corny at times. Luke's remorse over his aunt and uncles death seems rather short lived, particularly compared to his sadness over Ben Kenobi's death. Despite these flaws Star Wars is still an excellent film. Highly recommended!"
aobo33,"Jun 19, 2019",6/10,"(Short Review)
Here is something that George Lucas does not seem to understand about film: Movies DO get finished--they are finished when they are published to theaters (whether Mr. Lucas likes it or not), and finished movies are relics of the time in which they were first released into the world. I am not a Star Wars fan, and I probably never will be, because I am alienated by the definitive so-called ""special"" editions and I will never get past the fact that I can never, ever see the first film in its original form. A film (as well as its subsequent sequels) so pervasive and inescapable in American pop culture should not be tampered with at the whims of one man's ""vision.""Watching ""A New Hope,"" the obvious edits are very jarring and distracting, and it is frustrating to know that there may be several more alterations that I didn't notice because I can never compare it to the original. I can never evaluate the film ""Star Wars"" because, for all intents and purposes, it doesn't exist anymore. Who knows what rating I would give it? ""A New Hope"" is only a defiled remnant of what is widely considered to be one of the greatest films of all time, and for that it only deserves a 6 at best."
k_g_barreto,"Aug 29, 2019",9/10,"In 1977 Star Wars was released and 40 years after its release, pop culture still feels the impact that Star Wars brought it. Fantasy and sci-fi was combined in this classic cult, but the most charming thing about this movie is its characters, although being just introduced and not developed, but that's not a problem at all, in the following episodes they gained more development and deepth. Luke, Han, Leia and Kenobi were all interesting characters, and C3PO and R-2D2 are the most charismatic characters of the movie. Darth Vader, with such a magnificent and well-done design, have a strong presence in screen and keeps you interested about what are his motivations and backgroung, aside from what Obi-Wan told about him in the beginning, we don't know so much about the character.The movie is something unique and keeps you captivated from the very first minute, first with the opening crawl text, and then with the Rebellion's ship looking so small before the imposing and powerful Star Destroyer of the Empire, and now on you're on great piece of pop art. George Lucas marvelously manage to entertain with his space opera adventure, inspired by the Flash Gordon films, and the movie follow ""The Hero's Journey"" structure, from the work of Joseph Campbell ""The Hero with a Thousand Faces"", structure that now are already done beacause of its countless uses.The visual effects, something pioneering from its time, are astonishing, even to today's standards, I think, and of course I'm removing the changes that George Lucas has it done in the DVD and Blu-Ray releases, as the addition of Jabba the Hutt.The soundtrack of John Williams adds SO MUCH to the film. The theme song of Star Wars is something that everyone knows because of how iconic it is, and sounds like a anthem. The scene when Luke is looking at the sunset of Tatooine, and then The Force Theme begins to plays, is really, really something special and out of this world, and I know that everyone had goosebumps when seem it.The cultural relevance of Star Wars will continue to the foreeable future, and it's all thanks to George Lucas and this incredible movie, that will be relevant to generations to come. A New Hope is timeless, wonderful and one of the best fantasy movies to ever exist."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jun 10, 2006",7/10,"After seeing all six episodes of the Star Wars saga several times apiece, I still think this initial entry is interesting but one of weaker ones in the series. Perhaps that's because by now, the special-effects look primitive but also because it's a little slow in parts, slower than the other five films. Sometimes, though, it's nice to have more lulls as these modern-day action films many times overdo the violence. This one, however, is just a bit too slow overall.The first hour of this film sets up the second hour plus the two sequels that followed in the 1980s, showing how the principal characters were united, who they are fighting against and what mystical powers they have at their disposal. Note: it was even interesting to watch this film decades later after the final installment, episode 3, was viewed. It made this first entry make a little more sense, knowing the complete story (who was related to whom, how some died, etc.). It was also a shock to go back and see the special-effects in here after viewing those final three films issued in recent years.I always got annoyed, to be honest, at two things in this initial Star Wars film I felt were overdone: the ""Rambo"" mentality in which hundreds of shots are fired at the good guys and never hit them and the constant arguing between Carrie Fisher (""Princess Leia"") and Harrison Ford (""Han Solo""). By the third film, thankfully, that bickering stopped and everyone was ""on the same page.""Despite how old this film is, it's a ""must"" for this collection since it sets up so much of what is to follow. It's also kind of fun to look at this again and see how young everyone looks!"

bob the moo,"Jun 30, 2002",N/A,"The Republic has fallen and the Empire rules the galaxy as a dictatorship, seeking to destroy dissenting voices.  The Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star, is fully on line and capable of destroying whole systems.  The Jedi have been destroyed, save a few living in hiding, unable to compete with the force of the Empire.  However Princess Leia has the plans showing a weakness within the Death Star.  Before she is captured by Darth Vader she gives them to droids C3PO and R2D2 and they escape.  When they land on a nearby planet they find Luke Skywalker and set out to find the owner of the droids Obi Wan Kenobi, or Old Ben Kenobi.  Obi Wan begins to train Luke in the way of the force as they try to get the information to the Rebellion before the Death Star can be used at full power.It's not a brilliant piece of filmmaking  lets be honest, Lucas isn't the Shakespeare of our generation.  However what it is, is a good story of good v's evil, a western of goodies v baddies set in space.  The story is simple but contains clear characters.  The thing that sets it apart is the fun  the sense of wonder for kids but also the enjoyment it brings to adult. The story is good for a sci-fi with a lot of history and back-story clearly set out up front.  The action scenes are mostly great  not dry effects but with a real sense of action and excitement too.This may be the 4th part but it's also our first chapter, it is light and enjoyable but hints that this is only part of an ongoing battle.  The way it relates to kids and adults is obvious as it broke records and everyone of a certain age knows about Star Wars!  The effects still look good today  in many ways the model work looks better than all digital effects simply because they are `real' and don't just exist within a computer.  Sound effects, comedy, music  it's all pitch perfect and sets up the rest of the series really well.Hamil is ok as Skywalker (`Blonde hair, blue eyes'  Chasing Amy!).  He is suitable for a kids film and he does well with his role.  However like part 1 has Anakin at his least interesting, part 4 has Luke yet to develop into darker areas.  Ford is perfect as Han Solo  he adds character and flair to some dry performances.  Alec Guinness adds maturity to the whole film and is so good is Obi Wan that even Ewan McGregor just does an impression rather than recreate the role.  Darth Vader is just the right side of silly camp villain, Jones' voice is a perfect fit and he has real menace and power. Bits players such as Chewie, C3PO, R2D2 etc all add comedy in spades.Overall this film is even better now that we know how it all fits together in Star Wars `history'.  But even without all the hype this is a really fun sci-fi that is enjoyable, simple and really good fun to watch if you're in the mood.  Having a deeper perspective on it just makes it all the better."

This movie will and already is in the history books as the movie that changed the world! Star Wars, created by George Lucas, is the most iconic, awesome, epic and action-packed space opera ever made. This movie contains everything you want to see in a movie, for example: action, adventure, mystery, humor, emotion and, above all, creativity. The great visual and imaginative mind of George Lucas made it possible for other filmmakers to get from realistic movies to a generation of movies containing imagination and fantasy.The beginning of the movie is so perfectly written and makes it almost impossible for people not to like it. Firstly, the title scrawl. Although this scrawl was the same as the Flash Gordon series, in Star Wars this iconic and epic beginning was made great by the extraordinary music by John Williams. The music he composed made this movie what it is today and what it was then. His epic score for this movie was deservedly rewarded with an Academy Award.This great creation by George Lucas has influenced me, the American population and the rest of the world completely!!!"
FlikJedi719,"Jan 2, 2020",9/10,"A New Hope will forever go down in history as the start of one of the greatest cinematic adventures of all time. This movie is everything - from characters, to character development, to the introduction of John Williams' famous score, to crafting a great conflict between the protagonist and antagonist.The character development of Luke Skywalker in this movie alone shows nothing less than great storytelling. At the start of this movie, Luke just wanted to go to the ""Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!"", and by the end of the movie he's using the force to help destroy the greatest weapon of all time: ""That's no moon. It's a space station.""While I was not alive in 1977, I can only imagine the audiences reaction after seeing this gem of a film. It has lived on from generation to generation, and still generates awe inspiring wonder from a story told ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away....""Final grade: Easily a 9/10"
roghache,"Mar 26, 2006",9/10,"This is an incredibly entertaining and well crafted space epic that has become a modern day legend and spawned several (for me, disappointing) sequels and prequels. This classic is a basic story of good versus evil, combined with a futuristic space setting and special effects. While it may be kind of fun to jokingly tell others 'May the force be with you', no one should seriously be getting their theology from it (as a few cult like followers seem to) since really, it's essentially a science fiction fairy tale.As everyone must surely know, this original Star Wars tells the story of a handsome young farm boy and our hero, Luke Skywalker, who teams up with Han Solo, Chewbacca, a couple of 'droids' (C-P3O and R2-D2), and of course the grand master, Obi-Wan Kenobi to protect the galaxy from the villainous Darth Vader and save the beautiful Princess Leia from the clutches of the Evil Empire.The movie became part of everyday life in the late 1970's and 1980's, and the phrase 'Evil Empire' so commonplace and universally understood that President Raegan used it to describe the Communist regime of the former Soviet Union. His proposed plans for defensive space weaponry even became known as the Star Wars missile defense program.The actors are all perfect in their roles. Mark Hamill gives a charming boy next door heroism to the young Luke Skywalker, Harrison Ford a charismatic magnetism to Solo, Carrie Fisher a vulnerability, yet smart and feisty competence to the captive Princess, and Alec Guinness a mature wisdom to Kenobi. Of course the real stars of the show are C-P3O and R2-D2, an extremely lovable character who never actually speaks but simply pops and whistles. Each droid has a clearly defined personality and their interaction together is priceless.It's a great story with wonderfully noble, courageous heroes and dark, dreadful villains. Wonderful special effects of course and star fighting action sequences. In fact, the problem for me with the later Star Wars movies is that, apart from developing the character of Darth Vader and revealing the origin of his wickedness, the other films are primarily effects, star fighting, and galactic bars. Short on plot for adults, in my opinion. I really enjoyed this original picture, but found the prequels and sequels boring to sit through. Also, the Star Wars movies do not have anything comparable to the character interaction present in the Star Trek TV series or films, which I much prefer to Star Wars, even this original episode.However, George Lucas and his string of Star Wars pictures are a legend, and this first movie at least is a barrel of entertainment for both kids and adults."
cb_whitewood,"Apr 3, 2021",7/10,"It's historical and phenomenal for it's time, there's nostalgia, etc etc. I didn't grow up with these movies like so many others did, but I love camp, kitsch, pulp, and the like. This movie is great at setting up a large cast of characters and an immense world to explore, but something about this movie (after two watches) just doesn't get me rearing to keep watching Star Wars. Perhaps it's the 2-hour length, or the fact they made this film with the expectation there wouldn't be others, but after awhile I just get bored! Would still watch again with friends, but after doing so twice, I can't sit through it again on my own."
tml_pohlak_13,"Mar 12, 2009",7/10,"Star Wars begins as a really dull, flat, and boring film. 25 minutes into the film, and I still couldn't care less about the main characters. To be perfectly honest, I considered turning off the movie at that point, ranking it a 1 on IMDb, and writing a harsh review. But about 5 minutes later, the film really picks up, coinciding with the first appearance of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness). That's when the film becomes ""watchable"". It becomes entertaining as soon as Han Solo (Harrison Ford) appears.What's wrong with the first 25 minutes? It's just plain boring. Perhaps the biggest error is having the majority of the first 15 minutes spoken in an incomprehensible alien language. It is just so flat, that the appearance of Luke Skywalker does almost nothing to balance it out. But as soon as the plot picks up, it doesn't slow down.I also hate George Lucas' direction. His eternally wooden camera does little other than panning throughout this movie, and in fact, his career.James Earl Jones delivers an amazing performance as Darth Vader (O.K., I know he does only his voice, but still, that guy's voice is AMAZING!). Vader is the perfect choice for a movie villain: that mask is creepier than any deformed or disfigured face could be: always expressionless, constantly breathing heavily He's just plain, old-fashioned scary! This movie certainly has some fantastic acting, particularly from Harrison Ford, Alec Guinness, James Earl Jones (of course), and Mark Hamill (who would later voice the Joker in Batman: The Animated Series).Of course, the movie has its faults, especially when it comes to characters. Chewbacca and R2-D2 are quite possibly more annoying than watching Ace Ventura: The Animated Series.So overall, Star Wars begins very boring, but is very entertaining by the end."
Steviereno,"Jun 30, 2007",5/10,"Back in 1977, I was able to go to the theater and go right into the theater in Kankakee, IL, and thought, ""Wow! Everyone everywhere else is standing in line, and we got right in!"" Then, two hours later, I was asking myself, ""What the hell? THAT was what all the hoopla is all about?"" I'd seen better science fiction flicks as a kid in the 50s.Prior to seeing it, a co-worker had gushed about it, and I asked him what it was about. He told me the plot, and when he got done, I asked, ""And then...?"" I thought he'd described the opening half hour. And he said, ""That's the story. That's all of it."" After watching it, I was still asking that question, ""Where is the rest of the story?""The plot was simplistic, the dialog inane (when everyone thought that about the three new Star Wars episodes, they were in the majority), the characters really 'flat' and not very interesting. C3P0 and R2D2 as comic relief were just plain inadequate.To this day, I think people were just sheep, thinking that they had to say wonderful things about this movie, so they did. The amazing thing to me is that 30 years later, they are still not seeing this as the average B-movie that it is.Look, I LIKE Harrison Ford, and I LIKE the other actors in the movie, especially Alec Guiness. Okay, Mark Hamill wasn't Larry Olivier, but he is at least likable. And James Earl Jones has the best voice ever. But for this movie to be considered one of the best 20 movies of all time? Color me out of the mainstream.I agree with probably 8 out of the other 19 top-20 movies, so I must not be too freaking alien. Why is this movie given such status? I just don't get it."
itamarscomix,"Sep 24, 2011",9/10,"Before there was a trilogy, before there were prequels, before there was an expanded universe with hundreds of books, comics and video games, before Greedo shot first and before Jar Jar Bink was a speck of light in George Lucas' eye, there was Star Wars. Even if it's not the best film in the series (it's not), Star Wars deserves its own place in the history of cinema, as a work that changed Hollywood forever. It brought back the grandness of the epic cinema of the 30's and 40's and multiplied it, creating a new era of spectacle and excitement.Unlike the rest of the films, there's absolutely no need for an expanded universe or a complete saga to appreciate the original Star Wars by its own right. It's a complete tale, a classic saga that takes its queues from historical epics, samurai films and serials, and contains every aspect of the timeless hero's journey. The fact that it takes place 'in a galaxy far, far away' is trivial - though it did help the film have a bigger impact.Star Wars has very little to do with science fiction; not much of the science in it makes any sense, it might as well be magic. But that's what made it so powerful, and what made the prequels - that tried to explain everything away - so disappointing. Luke Skywalker's story is a classic story of the simple farm-boy who leaves his home and becomes a hero, and for that reason exactly it's timeless, and resonates with audiences even now.Now go see The Empire Strikes Back."
hitchcockthelegend,"Mar 29, 2009",10/10,"Princess Leia is captured and held hostage by the Imperial Army as it seeks to rule the Galactic Empire. An old Jedi Knight by the name of Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi may just be hers, and the rebels only hope. Teaming up with farm boy Luke Skywalker, scoundrel Captain Han Solo, and a couple of quirky droids, Kenobi sets off on a mission that could well shape the destiny of the Galaxy, and all who dwell within it.Back in 1977 I was but a wee 11 year old boy, weened on films from all genres by my movie loving parents, I had no idea that Star Wars was to have the same impact on me as Jaws had two summers previously, where yet again I found myself queueing around the block for two whole hours to see a film in a one screen theatre. My love of cinema firmly cemented, Star Wars was the start of a love affair that lasts to this very day.As the years have rolled by and my love of cinema has taken on more in-depth and serious tones, I have come to realise that Star Wars proves to be a far from flawless picture. Certainly its detractors do point to some frayed acting and call the plot structure a jazzed up good versus evil axis, while the charge of George Lucas referencing many prior pictures most assuredly stands, but really do those things matter? No they do not, because Star Wars opened up a new world of cinema, something of a portal to youngsters such as I, it got people talking and debating about the merits of model work in films (which is of an extraordinary high standard here), it nudged film makers to explore being bigger and bolder in their approach, and crucially, above all else, it got film goers hungry again, a hankering for more please if you may. Now it has to be said that all that followed 20th Century Fox's historic blockbuster didn't run with the baton, in fact most pale into comparison on impact value, but for better or worse (depending on the discerning viewers peccadilloes), Star Wars stands as a bastion of adventure laden entertainment.It is by definition one of the most successful films in history, George Lucas perhaps didn't know it at the time, but in what was to become an almost operatic anthology, he didn't just make a movie, he created a whole new world seeping with style and rich texture. Almost as amazing as the success of the series, is how it has become part of modern day pop culture, anything from religion to everyday speak has at some time or another referenced Lucas' baby. Ultimately, though, it's one single thing that made (and still does make) Star Wars so great, it's that it has the ability to lift the audience into a rousing united feel good cheer; and that is something that few films can ever lay claim too. In 1977 it was an awe inspiring event to watch in the theatre, now here in my middle age it's an event that is like hugging a dear old friend, a friend that I know will never ever let me down no matter how many times I turn to it. 10/10"
tom-darwin,"Apr 22, 2006",8/10,"The very first note of John Williams's horn-blaring score as the film's title in thousand-foot-high block letters flashes on screen is the very moment when American film-making turned inexorably to big-budget, grand-themed audiovisual extravaganza strung together with simple stories, snappy catchphrases & cutesy jokes. But if George Lucas decided to follow Henry Ford rather than John Ford, he built a Shelby Cobra & left Pinto-making to his many, many imitators. Ironically, he himself remade one of the finest works of film master Akira Kurosawa, the Western-themed ""Hidden Fortress,"" with one scene (the fight in the bar) lifted from ""Yojimbo."" As a result, ""Star Wars"" has a bit of the jittery discomfort of characters trying to fit into a story that wasn't quite made for them, like people with past life experiences that intrude into the present. Kurosawa's hero is split not into two but THREE heroes in ""Star Wars"" (four if you include the princess, who has a more prominent role in ""Star Wars""). Hamill's Luke is often overshadowed by Kenobi (Guinness, whose skill had aged better than any fine wine) and Solo (Ford, in the role that deservedly made him a star), though he often holds his own as the clueless but determined farmboy-turned-hero. In less than five minutes, ""Star Wars"" sets the standard of outer-space audiovisual special effects that the industry was bound to follow from then on, forever sweeping away the earnest, toylike realism that Gerry Anderson was then giving us in ""Space: 1999"" in favor of exhausting but beautiful orgies of fast, violent, sweeping movement culminating in explosions of bright color & blaring sound. No wonder there's never any sex. ""Star Wars"" is science fiction only because it's set in outer space, by which standard ""Dirty Harry"" is a detective story & ""Last Tango in Paris"" a romance. Little attempt is made to explain the technological wonders depicted (we never find out why light sabers never have to be recharged or get even a cursory explanation of the Death Star). What little science there is can't be counted on, as when Solo extols the drag-racing abilities of the Millennium Falcon in parsecs, which are units of distance, not elapsed time. But Lucas never means to educate, only to entertain. Solo is a smuggler, not a science officer, while the others are not doctors or engineers but warriors, royalty or villains. Lucas's hammerhanded excess works because it never lets up & never goes for the cheap & easy. Though the heroes are unconvincing, ""Star Wars"" creates an array of badguys in the Galactic Empire that remain unsurpassed in cinema, headed by Darth Vader, who makes the Wicked Witch of the West look like Mrs. Piggle-Wiggle. In another irony, the most memorable scene in ""Star Wars"" is the motionless roundtable conference chaired by Tarkin (Cushing, in the greatest role of his long career) which yielded phrases long & gleefully repeated by a delighted America (""This station is now the ultimate power in the universe!"" ""This bickering is pointless!"" ""I find your lack of faith disturbing""). Perhaps, with the space program petering out & the hard realities of nuclear energy coming home to us, our fascination with scientific exploration was wearing thin. In the 1960s it enabled the cast of ""Star Trek"" to bring the writings of sci-fi geniuses to life with cardboard & aluminum foil. Never again. What better honor, or infamy if you like, could there be to ""Star Wars"" than that the ""Star Trek"" movies of the 1980s followed the simple themes, cuteness & spectacular effects of ""Star Wars,"" turning their backs on their own heritage of awed exploration? Perhaps that first detractors and then supporters of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative nicknamed it ""Star Wars"" so convincingly that the original name was quickly forgotten. The film might be a bit dated with its holistic, New Age mysticism (feel the force FLOWING through you!) which likely owes more to Jack Kerouac than Musashi Miyamoto & which became more difficult to depict with a straight face the farther the sequels & prequels went. Nevertheless, it was a worthy successor to the Code of the West, especially in contrasting Darth Vader with Luke & Kenobi. ""Star Wars"" can't really be judged by the standards of other films, partly because it reset the standards & partly because it became, most unusually, the fourth in a series of six! But there's no doubt that it's a heroic sensory extravaganza that will leave the viewer at once exhausted & exhilarated--and will do it over & over again, without offending, condescending or making one think too hard. If you just want to escape to a galaxy far, far away, jettison all skepticism, lower your shields & prepare to make the jump to hyperspace."
ametaphysicalshark,"Nov 4, 2008",N/A,"I was never a ""Star Wars"" guy growing up. I wouldn't say that I was a ""Star Trek"" guy growing up either (""Doctor Who"" was my sci-fi franchise of choice growing up, and still is, even though I'm not a big fan of Russell T. Davies' version of the show), but I would definitely choose my favorite episodes of the original series or ""Deep Space 9"", ""The Wrath of Khan"", and ""The Undiscovered Country"" over any ""Star Wars"" film. I've seen the original trilogy a couple of times previously, once as a kid, once in my mid-teens, and now I sit down to watch ""Star Wars"" again, having been inspired by catching half of ""The Empire Strikes Back"" on TV recently and being enthralled by it.The first thing that struck me is how great the opening shot is, just after the scrolling text that is. The rest of the movie was pretty much how I remembered it being- a collection of great set-pieces and memorable characters, and a great mythology, but with a story which wasn't nearly as grand and great as ""The Empire Strikes Back"". Although a point of criticism aimed at ""Star Wars"" by its (relatively few) detractors is that it doesn't quite match the real feel of a 30's/40's serial, I think that it really does, and not only in the way it is shot and the transitional wipes and all that, but in the writing, the acting, and just about everything else. It has that same sense of adventure, and although this particular film is nowhere near as good as some of my favorite serials, it remains something which very accurately captures the feel of watching one of those, and its popularity (and the popularity of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"") is hence quite understandable, as very few of even the big summer blockbusters have the same sensibility and sense of adventure, and well, fun.Watching ""Star Wars"", in spite of it not being my favorite of the original trilogy, serves as a reminder of the talent which George Lucas had at one point. I don't think this film is as good as his previous effort, ""American Graffiti"", which is the greatest 'coming of age' film I've ever seen, and one of the most beautiful films ever made from a visual standpoint, but it's still got spirit and energy which his later efforts just don't. It's quite sad, really.There's really nothing I can say that hasn't been said already (which is true, certainly of many popular films, but this is freakin' ""Star Wars"", so trust me, I have NOTHING to add to what has already been said). There are ""Star Wars"" devotees who swear it is the greatest of the trilogy and one of the best movies ever made, there are detractors who think it's cheesy nonsense, and then there are others like me who like it quite a bit, but aren't sure where all the extravagant praise comes from. ""The Empire Strikes Back""... Well, that's a whole other story.8/10"
TheUnknown837-1,"Apr 14, 2007",7/10,"It is a shame that not any other of George Lucas's films were as fun and inspiring as his unforgettable epic ""Star Wars: A New Hope"". It was a film that has since been spoofed and ripped-off in many forms of media. It has five sequels, and has many branch-off television series. And it is undeniably one of the most financially successful and definitely one of the better science-fiction films of this or any other age.""Star Wars"" has one of the most brilliantly constructed and detailed alternative reality settings ever. Literally everything in it makes the ""galaxy"" seem like a real place. Not only is there civilizations of humans, but civilizations of other creatures, and there are livestock and other creatures like in our world. Names such as droids, banthas, and wookiees work out. But I do feel that the ""sandpeople"" could've had a more compelling name. The concept of blasters and lightsabers were pure genius and the effects used on these weapons were state-of-the-art for their time. The props and CGI used for the other creatures, such as Chewbacca, may not be acceptable if ""Star Wars"" came out today, but were great for back then. Costume design was magnificent, especially the great details put into the villainous character of Darth Vader, who is perhaps the most memorable movie villain ever. Although he wouldn't really make his terror so profound and complete until the first sequel ""The Empire Strikes Back."" The concept of the Death Star is also a fine one.But while ""Star Wars"" most certainly looks great in terms of detail and special effects, and even moreso on the entertainment level, there are some details that I have a really hard time accepting. Mostly, it's concerned with the screenplay. George Lucas is truly a great screenwriter when it comes to developing story, but when it comes to dialogue, he's not the best there is. Some of the dialogue in the film, mostly the lines spoken by Princess Leia, make me wince. For example her quote ""I should have known it was you holding Vader's lease. I smelled your foul stench when I was brought onboard."" What sensible person would even think of saying a line that dumb? I also personally felt that Luke Skywalker asked WAY too many questions and too many times. In the Tatooine part of the movie, he asks ""Do you know what he's talking about?"" numerous times, more than necessary. And all of the lines featuring the word ""sandpeople"" just seemed weakening to the script. The ""sandpeople"" were suppose to sound frightening, but they just sound pathetic.Basically, the one and only thing that I have wrong with ""Star Wars"" is its dialogue sequences. And that is because George Lucas's weakness at writing is dialogue, which he freely admits to. But that does not make ""Star Wars"" a bad movie. Perhaps I was disappointed with it, but it's still a great movie to watch."
delibebek,"Apr 28, 2009",9/10,"It's what movies are all about, really - sitting in a seat that's already been worn in by a thousand other tushes, crunching as much popcorn under your feet as you crunch in your mouth by handfuls, sipping a soda that's three times as big as you would ever really need... and then there's this very quiet little opening line written on the screen, like a new way of saying ""once upon a time..."" and you know the fairy tale is beginning, but before you can even get ready to get interested, that fateful, stirring, uplifting and scary chord throws you deep into your seat, in time with a logo that's too big for the screen... and the rest is just a ride. That's what movies are all about and that's what Star Wars gave us.If you never saw it in the theater, get yourself a really great audio visual system in your house, pour soft drinks on the floor (prep this a day prior to get the proper sticky effect) put too much salt and too much butter on a bucket of popcorn that's too big, and hit the ""play"" button on the remote."

The strategy of George Lucas that claimed that there was no technology available to the cinema industry in 1977 to produce the three first chapters was part of a marketing strategy that kept alive the interest of fans fro the whole six chapters, In sequence, great part of the mystery would not have raised. All the films are engaging, but none of them can beat this one rated #19 in IMDb. Harrison Ford in the top of his career and the cast show a wonderful chemistry.

LaBelleAurore,"May 22, 2005",8/10,"This film single-handedly changed modern cinema to what we know it to be today. It is the ultimate modern fairy tale. A young knight runs off with a wise old wizard to save the princess from the clutches of evil. Of course, it runs a little deeper than that, and makes the old tale of good versus evil so much more compelling. Setting it long ago in a galaxy far, far away is pure genius and it introduces us to a futuristic galaxy of beautiful style and diversity that leaves us with a fantastic space opera. Despite its unfamiliar setting, we can relate to all the characters. There's the handsome maverick, the beautiful heroine, the aspiring young knight, the wise old mentor, and the darkly clad villain. Even the droids are characters we can recognise and relate to. What is so special about this film is that the distractions of things like politics, geography, and nationality are eliminated to leave us with simple humanity. This film has everything you could ever want. The characters are great; the action's great; the story is magnificent, and of course there's philosophy too.... Oh, what am I talking about?

LeonLouisRicci,"Oct 9, 2017",9/10,"Director/Writer George Lucas's immensely Influential Film was itself Influenced by a Myriad of Classic Stories, Films, and Mythology.He Packaged all of the Seminal Hard-Wire of Humanity, Soul Searching, and Hero's Journey into a Kid-Friendly, Action/Adventure, Sci-Fi Template that Everyone, including Adults, immediately Tapped into and the Movie became an Entity so Enormous and Epic that it Remains to this Day Synonymous with a Religion.The Movie is Entirely Entertaining at its Core and like all Classics can be Viewed with Multiple Meanings with Layers of Characters both Good and Evil Battling for the Control of Existence.Decidedly Deconstructed and Rendered Under a Microscope from Pop Culture Scholars and Cultists the Film has been Analyzed, Annotated, and Admired for what it was and what it has become.The Formula has been Broken Down to its Individual Elements and Commented Upon by the Countless Voices of Fanatics and Film Historians.

masonsaul,"Dec 16, 2019",10/10,"Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is almost overwhelmingly iconic since the dialogue is so quotable, the iconography is unforgettable and even the sound effects are easy to recognise. It's an operatic coming of age story built on the accessible conventions of a classic good vs evil adventure and it is one of cinema's finest pieces of escapism. The film's stakes are epic, complimented by faultless pacing and simple yet effective messaging for its intended younger audience.Everyone's performances are great. Mark Hamill navigates a fantastic character arc as Luke experiences the wider galaxy for the first time and Alec Guinness brings plenty of soulful intelligence to Obi-Wan Kenobi whilst gracefully hinting at the pain he's still carrying from the clone wars. Harrison Ford instantly makes Han Solo one of the all time coolest characters and gradually shows that he has a more caring side behind his initially selfish, seen it all before attitude.Carrie Fisher has a suitably headstrong nature as Princess Leia so she retains her confident independence even if she does need saving at first. Peter Cushing's villain operates in a cunning manner which offers a sophisticated villainy contrasted by the presence of Darth Vader. James Earl Jones' impeccable voicework enhances the character's already imposing figure to create one of cinema's greatest villains who commands the screen from minute one.Director George Lucas convincingly builds an entire galaxy, undoubtedly helped and hindered by the special edition alterations in an equal measure. The now trademark opening crawl sets the scene beautifully and John Barry's production design makes everything feel alive and lived in. All the original special effects are amazing including some standout model work and Gilbert Taylor's mostly static cinematography constantly creates painterly images.The editing by Marcia Lucas, Paul Hirsch and Richard Chew is extremely clean with wonderful transitions, maintains a strong pace and is more vital to the film's quality than it initially appears. John Williams delivers a perfect score that contains much of his most recognisable work. It's a constant presence which allows it to elevate the film further thanks to how incredibly evocative every piece is, especially when they're combined with the binary sunset scene and climactic trench run."

The reviewer whom stated that Star Wars is a ""Kid's Fantasy. An Adult's Memory"" was spot on! I was three years from being born when the film was released in theatres but I was lucky enough to grow up with big brothers who introduced me as soon as I was old enough to watch. I cannot thank them enough for that.There is nothing better than reliving the epic stories of the Star Wars films on a rainy weekend!"
Bored_Dragon,"Dec 9, 2018",7/10,"Episodes I and II have 6,5 on IMDb, III has 7,7 and this one has almost 9. I don't understand. Maybe I am not able to see things from the '70s perspective, I was not even born back then, but from my point of view, all four I saw so far are on more or less same level, slightly above average movies. I'm giving 7 to all of them. I just have to acknowledge one thing as first time viewer. If I didn't know anything about this franchise before watching it, it is possible that I wouldn't even notice two-decade space between trilogies. Sure, when you see 3 movies from the 21st century and then in the 4th sequel you see Harrison Ford as a youngster, it reveals pretty much, but other than that trilogies are perfectly blended.7/10"
SouthernViews,"Jan 16, 2024",10/10,"What can I say about this movie that already hasn't been said? I remember seeing this on the big screen as a kid and being in total awe of that opening shot. I'd never seen anything like that before. I've lost track of how often I've seen this film, but it never gets old. Everything works. The story, pacing, direction, sound, effects, and acting are simply brilliant.In my ranking of the nine movies in the three trilogies, Episode IV - A New Hope ranks #1. I gave the follow-up Empire the same rating, but I have to place the movie that started it all as my top pick. Episode IV launched not only a massive cinematic universe but also made lasting impacts to pop culture. How can it not be the best?"
Falko_h1,"May 14, 2024",6/10,"""Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope"" is the film that launched a cultural phenomenon, introducing audiences to a galaxy far, far away and a cast of iconic characters. Directed by George Lucas and released in 1977, the film follows farm boy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) as he embarks on an epic journey to rescue Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) from the clutches of the evil Empire.While ""A New Hope"" may feel somewhat dated by today's standards, its impact on cinema and popular culture cannot be overstated. The film's groundbreaking special effects, memorable characters, and timeless storytelling continue to captivate audiences of all ages.While some viewers may find certain aspects of the film's pacing and dialogue to be a bit uneven, its sense of adventure and imaginative world-building remain unparalleled. Overall, ""A New Hope"" is a classic sci-fi adventure that continues to inspire and entertain audiences around the world."
owenrees,"Jan 7, 2025",5/10,I saw this movie in the cinema when it was first released and from the very beginning it was impressive. The opening set the tone - a spaceship is seen running away from a pursuer and then the ship following it appears and just keeps on getting bigger until it fills the whole screen and you finally see the engines at the back. The scale was far beyond anything else I had seen.The cantina scene was also memorable with the alien band not being overdone and the character of Han Solo being established as rather doubtful as one to associate with.The revised versions added filler in various places that did not add to the story at all. In many ways they undermined the sense of bleakness and despair that should have been seen as what you would expect in a remote outpost of a ruthless empire.I wish I could get hold of a copy of the original version to revisit my first experience but that does not seem possible.
Ace-30,"Aug 4, 1998",10/10,"I cannot believe that the American Film Institute, while rating the top 100 films of all time, rated Star Wars as being 15th on the list.  It should have made the top five at least if not the top three.Wake up industry, this was the movie that changed the way sci-fi movies were made.  It still looks great here 21 years later!"
OllieSuave-007,"Jun 16, 2007",8/10,"This is the movie that probably changed sci-fi and fantasy films of the cinema, full of action, imagination, nostalgia, character development and charm. The 4th movie of the Star Wars trilogy, but the first and original Star Wars movie filmed, it starts with a ship being invaded by Darth Vader, who has kidnapped Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). Later on, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) teams up with Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), Ben Kenobi (Alec Guiness), C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) in an attempt to rescue the Princess Leia, who leads a group of rebels to defy the evil empire controlled by a ruthless Sith Lord and guarded by his trusted servant, Darth Vader. They must also stop the Death Star from destroying the galaxy. The result is one huge mission to save the galaxy, supported by superb direction and story from George Lucas and a memorable music score from John Williams.Each character was given his/her unique purpose in the movie, but all are committed to achieving triumph of the dark forces of evil. This fast-paced movie gives the audience a break from the reality of the problematic world, and takes you to a journey into an imagination beyond belief. Not to be missed.So, may the forces be with you.Grade B+"
AlsExGal,"Jul 11, 2015",9/10,"The latest TCM production entitled TCM Presents A Night at the Movies: George Lucas & The World of Fantasy Cinema, was really 2/3 about Lucas's films and it seemed that 2/3 of that was about Star Wars - but that was OK because it finally drove home to me what I have suspected for years - that George Lucas did not and does not have a clue as to what made Star Wars great. He got lucky with the first one (this film) because it was a product of its time and was what people WANTED to see in 1977 - something hopeful and fun. Remember - or maybe you are too young to remember - movies in the mid 70s were extremely cynical post Watergate and post Vietnam. This one was different and even religious in an ecumenical way. Lucas got lucky with the second one because of the director and his input. To me, all the ones that came after The Empire Strikes Back were special effects filled duds. Now back to the original.In that cynical era in which nothing was black and white and everything seemed at least gray and a little tainted came this little space western. The sound effects were hokie, the graphics were poorly rendered, and all of the creatures were real men and women in rubber suits not CGI. But that was not the point. The point was that HERE was a force of pure evil - The Empire - that everybody could be completely against. The heroes were imperfect yet you could rally around them. You have a young boy of about 19 who is treated well by his farming aunt and uncle but wants a bigger destiny, you have an old man living in the hills like a hermit that wants that young boy to join the fight against the empire, and not until The Empire touches the boy personally does he make a rather hasty decision to do so. There is a girl, a princess, who is not waiting for somebody to come rescue her and helpless. She's tough, she can handle a weapon, and she can handle the fourth in their little band, Han Solo, who sticks his neck out for nobody a la Casablanca's Rick Blaine and seems completely mercenary, yet he gets involved.If you like science fiction and good old fashioned adventure you'll like it. If you are young and feel that your destiny is slipping through your fingers and are itching to make a difference, or if you are older and want a chance to right a wrong that you feel at least partially responsible for you'll love it. And you CAN shoot first in the face of danger, have lived a pretty self involved life, change, and become the hero. As the 1977 original trailer said ""Star Wars - for the fun of it"" and for the philosophy of it too."
sprogers,"May 29, 2004",10/10,"I first saw this movie (or at least as far as I can remember) when i was about 4. It wasn't until I was about 8 that I really got into the whole saga. I have to say #4 isn't my favorite of the films, but it is the one that started the greatest sci fi epic ever. I think for it's time the special effects were magnificent. And the acting was done by REAL actors from back in the day. Now a days all I seem to see coming up in the thespian ranks are pretty boys and girls with fake boobs. What happened. Anyways, i think everyone should watch this movie at least once. If your not ""enlightened"" by it you'll at least be entertained by a few good humor spots."
antialias11,"Oct 3, 2004",10/10,"Well, I just re-watched this on DVD. I first saw it when I was 10 in 1981, and I still love this move (one of my all time favorites), but I guess I love it for some reasons different than most other people:1) The movie has no love story to speak of. This is such a huge bonus that it cannot be stressed enough. For kids a love story is sheer boredom - and there are unfortunately very few films without one. For adults the love story is usually pure BS (as the over romanticizing that goes on in Hollywood movies make any love story a nauseous experience. Episodes V and VI scrape the line of how much love story a movie can take before being totally corny. Lets not talk about how much the love story ruins episodes I and II (and will probably kill episode III also))2) There are no lengths in the movie. It dumps you right in the middle of the conflict after the opening (no opening credits to bore your pants off! This is almost unique amongst films). It practically grabs you before you have gotten comfortable in your seat. The DVD does add some lengths with gratuitous CGI which actually hurt the film more than they help (the ride into Mos Eisley and the Falcon approaching Yavin seem interminable compared to the fast paced cuts of the original version. These scenes break the rhythm of the movie badly, they add neither story nor depth nor information - luckily they are far enough apart not to hurt it too much)3) The special effects are still spectacular after all these years. Not in what they look like but how they are shot, the dynamics of it and the ideas for cool POVs (taking old aerial battle films as scripts was a stroke of genius)4) Detail. This thing is all about attention to detail. There is nothing out of place here. Nothing glossed over by large plastic sheeting. everything has structure and depth and looks used. The world it portrays becomes believable. economies are worked out. This has the look of a good role playing adventure.5) The plot isn't explained by the characters. Characters involved in such a plot for some time are supposed to know what the background is without having to talk to each other about it (nobody needs to be told that the empire is evil, this is common knowledge with these people as they have lived under it for decades). Putting things into the scroller at the beginning which could not be said by the characters because it would be akin to them holding up neon signs displaying ""For the audiences' information"" was a stroke of genius. I cringe at other movies that insert 'let me explain what is happening' scenes.Overall I can see nothing wrong with this movie. The soundtrack and the sound effects are amazing. Some scenes seem to be re-recorded with different sound standards and thus stand out uncomfortably, but this isn't much of a problem. The actors do their jobs well (especially Harrison Ford when he flashes that roguish grin - he is practically the archetype of the lovable, charismatic scoundrel). This DVD is definitely a keeper (10/10)."
Cinesational,"Oct 26, 2013",9/10,"When I was 12, I went to see Star Wars in the theater 32 times. This is the film that made me want to make films. Star wars is a classic in my mind, full of fun, and campy lines.. The story is about a farm boy named Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) who discovers that the used robot recently purchased by his family plays back a message from one Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), begging for help from Obi-Wan Kenobi. Luke asks his father's friend Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness) about this, and he discovers that Ben and Obi-Wan are one and the same. Kenobi tells Luke of the battle of the rebels against the ruling Empire and the spiritual energy called ""The Force."" Soon Luke, Kenobi, and a mercenary named Han Solo (Harrison Ford) join forces to rescue Princess Leia from the Empire's mammoth warship, the Death Star, controlled by evil genius Darth Vader (David Prowse, with the voice of James Earl Jones)."

Sure it's revolutionary at the time it came out for the first time, but really if you watch it right now there is actually quite a lot of flaws in the movie, from the goofy and silliness, an unsatisfied and weird death, but an amazing visual design, creature, set, John Williams incredible score, the fun that all the actor do, and so do the audience watching it and at least for me mostly, it's still a pretty good movie overall."
AlexSamodurov,"Sep 26, 2025",7/10,"When George Lucas' Star Wars first debuted in 1977, it must have amazed audiences. The concept of a blockbuster film was already invented. But no one could have predicted a computer-generated blockbuster that could realize a galaxy far, far away.This is the promise of Star Wars. The grandeur of Lucas' ""Space Opera"", woven through mythology, religion, and rebellion. These three concepts give Star Wars a relatable context. That context proves instrumental in creating every aspect of this blockbuster. From John Williams' repeating orchestra to the worn-down look of the starships. In a galaxy far, far away, everything feels like it could fit right at home. And yet, the computer generated effects just don't.A New Hope infamously had a tight budget, and you can feel it. In a ""Space Opera"", there must be a certain level of VFX fidelity in order to believe it. There are two moments in the third act that detract from the otherwise strong context of Star Wars. Combined with a predictable plot and somewhat cheesy characters, it just misses the potential of the ""Space Opera"".Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is not as great as many people say it is. However, it introduces a strong context to build an entire galaxy off of. It introduces characters that have defined pop culture, like Darth Vader, Luke Skywalker, Ben Kenobi, and the charismatic Han Solo. It is, quite possibly, the most important film of all time in regards to the term ""blockbuster"". 7/10."
myt1,"Aug 27, 2001",4/10,"Just because you want this film to be Kurosawa or ""The Searchers"" or ""a hypotext of classic iconographic scenes"" doesn't make it so.Nothing more than a comic book on film.A bad comic book badly filmed.May the farce be with you."
hansololover,"Apr 18, 2005",10/10,"This movie, along with the whole original trilogy, just blows me away! It truly has all the elements a good story needs. The characters have suction cups all over them that glue them to your memory, because they're just so great! The story revolves around young Luke Skywalker, a farm boy who wants more adventure in his life. Adventure finally arrives to him in the form of two droids, sent by Princess Leia, a beautiful woman begging someone named Obi-Wan Kenobi for help. Leia is a huge part of Rebel Alliance, a group of people determined to stop the Empire's reign of terror and evil. When Luke meets up with Obi-Wan, they set out to deliver plans inside the droid to Leia's father, plans that can stop the most destructive weapon ever from destroying any planet that stands up for good. Teaming up with a cocky pilot who is more caring than he lets on named Han Solo and his CoPilot Chewbacca (big dog/ape/bigfoot like creature) the heroes are thrust into adventure beyond Luke's wildest dreams, complete with a heroine, henchmen, space ships, battles and the most menacing villain a movie has ever seen.Star Wars is a movie you won't forget soon after watching it. It's full of excitement, humor, romance (more so in the ESB, the sequel), great dialogue danger, and a never tiresome fight between good and evil. I recommend the trilogy to anyone and everyone who hasn't seen it (that would be...3 people...don't worry though, I'm a pretty newly converted fan too!) Han Solo rocks! May the force be with you all. 10/10"
Mr-Fusion,"May 25, 2015",9/10,"In all honesty, I didn't plan on watching ""Star Wars"" on its 38th anniversary, but a happy accident nonetheless. To see this movie is to go back to a time when the mythology was in its nascent stages, before all the merchandising and parodies (really, a testament to its cultural impact, which is immense). It's deceptively simple; all of the classical elements are here - clearly defined heroes and villains, robots, space pirates, wizards, princesses, sorcery - remixed and flung off into a faraway galaxy. It all makes for a potent brew, to say the least. And when all is said and done, the movie's real power is its ability to tap into the kid in all of us. This is just plain fun, and not even Lucas' shoddy CGI rejiggering can tarnish that.9/10"
seansworks,"Feb 24, 2012",10/10,"How many influences did Lucas bring together for the first truly big sci-fi (ish) box office smash? Classic Samurai films, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Buck Rodgers. He took a clash of the greatest adventures of the first half of the twentieth century and brought them all into a single, sublime movie.Read/seen/played a kid with his parents/guardians murdered by the bad guys? Or a slightly mysterious/wise/cooky old teacher to teach the protagonist the ""ways"" of whatever? Or perhaps a grinning, sarcastic buddy that gets the protagonist out of trouble? Odds are if it was made sometime past 1977 you have Star Wars to thank for that.Heck, the very idea of background characters being named and rising to prominence is thanks to this movie. Or more specifically thanks to the toys eventually born out of it. Lucas negotiated the toy and merchandising rights and went right to work putting out every character there was, and since they had to have names in order to sell they were given names. Thus birthing the idea that characters once thought totally unimportant might be more than they seemed for fans of an IP.Oh, and as for the movie itself? One of the best scored movies in history, there might not be another movie in history with music more easily or widely recognizable than Star Wars. It was also written in a way so easy to wrap your head around that much of the dialogue can be recognized even by people that have seen it maybe once or twice.But the biggest claim I would make for the original Star Wars is that its the best edited and paced movie in history. Every movie study and screenplay writing example I've seen (and having taken college classes, and seen quite a few I have wide sample) has the original Star Wars as its perfect example of how to pace a movie. If you want to look for the perfect example of ""the roller-coaster"" of movie excitement, rising action spaced out with occasional dips, rising to a peak and then falling as the story ends are tied together; well, you're going to find its the original Star Wars.Like with any category of product or scientific field, forms of entertainment have things that shove them forward, that innumerable people after the fact owe a lot too. ""Standing on the shoulders of giants"" as it were. And Star Wars is one such thing, a giant of entertainment that so many works after it have stood upon to reach for their own heights.But even more important than that, it's just a damned fun movie. I've seen it more times than I care to admit. And yet even years later, years after the rabid Star Wars fanhood of my preteens has long faded, after I've grown bored and have little interest in seeing most any movie a second time I can still watch the original Star Wars and by the end have a huge grin on my face."
cinemafan1996,"Aug 1, 2007",10/10,"Star Wars changed everyone's lives when it came out in 1977, including mine. I can still remember the anticipation as a little kid waiting in line to see this amazing movie I kept reading about.It definitely lived up to every bit of hype I had heard up to that point. I got my popcorn and my soda, sat down with my cousin and we watched in awe at everything we saw on the screen.I am definitely a Star Wars kid, and feel very lucky to have actually seen the original in the theater, something that today's kids can never experience because all big event films are all children of Star Wars after all. But there will never be anything like this first movie, the greatest film of all time! If you haven't seen it yet, see it!"
CinemaClown,"Jan 19, 2016",N/A,"This is the film that started it all. The first instalment in the Star Wars saga that would later go on to revolutionise its genre, change the landscape blockbuster filmmaking & become a cultural phenomenon, Star Wars (also known as Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope) is a cinematic feat of imagination, vision & creativity that hypnotized an entire generation with its freshly envisioned & awe-inspiring world, first-rate adventure, interesting characters, state-of-the-art visuals & an epic soundtrack.Having no nostalgic relation whatsoever with this epic space opera, all I can say is that my first stint with Star Wars didn't go as well as I anticipated. Where others heaped praise upon its visual effects, set pieces & other stuff, I found it to be a picture that wasn't just awfully dated but also terribly juvenile, filled with cartoonish creatures, unintentionally hilarious & pretty mediocre in all departments. The ingredients that made it a revolution of its time are visible beneath its degraded visuals but it's not as timeless as they say it is.Set in a galaxy far far away, Star Wars finds the galaxy in a state of civil war for a conflict brews between the Galactic Empire & the Rebel Alliance. The plot focuses on Luke Skywalker, a young boy on a desert planet who inadvertently acquires a pair of droids that possess vital information from Princess Leia regarding the Empire's latest weapon plus her request for help, following which he joins forces with a Jedi Knight, a couple of smugglers & his two droids to rescue the princess from the evil Darth Vader and save the galaxy from the Empire's tyranny.Written & directed by George Lucas, Star Wars is his pet project that permanently engraved his name in the annals of cinema and later spawned a franchise that would go on to redefine epic filmmaking. What's commendable is the mythology Lucas created from the scratch, taking inspirations from different sources but adding an original touch to it. The movie features a simple good vs evil storyline, but what elevates it above mediocrity is its then-sweeping special effects, innovative filmmaking techniques, fascinating set pieces, stunning score, few excellent characterisations & a sense of something new yet familiar.Considering the time it was released, Production design team makes efficient use of its limited budget to come up with wonderfully detailed set pieces, the stupid-looking aliens are brought to life with puppetry or whatever means was available back then, Cinematography exhibits some inventiveness which is quite evident from the first frame. Visual effects was groundbreaking in the 1970s but has severely degraded over the years and looks very cartoonish nowadays. Editing provides a consistent pace & fine flow to its narrative but its 121 minutes can become suffocating if you're not intrigued by its fantasy world.And then there is John Williams who contributes with an iconic score that evokes a sense of epicness at all times plus his soundtrack comprises of tracks that beautifully compliment the story's adventurous ambiance. Coming to the performances, Star Wars is notable for launching the acting career of many and features quite an ensemble in Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness & others who chip in with fine inputs in their given roles. Although nearly all the characters present in this film became part of the modern culture, Darth Vader is the only one that was impressive in my opinion, plus James Earl Jones' voice did add an intimidating quality to him.On an overall scale, Star Wars: Episode IV – A New Hope may not look as dazzling & revolutionary today as it was during its time of release but its influence on later sci-fi space operas & other films cannot be understated. For me, this was more or less disappointing for its severely outdated visual encapsulation never allowed me to take any of the unfolding events seriously and for the most part, it was downright laughable. It may have evoked an entirely different reaction from me if I had seen it at least 15 years ago but as of now, even though the effect of Star Wars on its genre, blockbusters & film marketing can still be felt, I feel no love for the saga that many happen to be so crazy about."
PickyFlicks,"May 5, 2024",7/10,"For reference, I'm a 21 year old female in search of the best comfort films/series. My favourites include Harry Potter, The Vampire Diaries, The Summer I Turned Pretty, and more. If you have similar taste this review is for you.I think that what's so off about this series ""openers"" is that they truly didn't plan anything around the future prequels.This was, and would've been a great introduction to the series if they'd left it as is, but watching it after the first 3 prequel films, it's just too flat. Honestly, if I had my time back, I would've watched them in order of release instead.We already know almost all of the characters (besides Han Solo and Chewy), and their purposes are extremely predictable. Of course, they needed to find a way to bring the main three together, but that's basically all that happened in this film. There were no great twists or anything surprising in this one, so for that reason, I can't rate it any higher.But there are a lot of positives too. All of the characters have large personalities and great chemistry. In my opinion that's always the most important thing about a series.The plot was entertaining, and it has a very specific vibe. It just gives off that classic Star Wars energy (obviously), but I think that's so important. It makes it irreplaceable.It's definitely grabbed my attention, and I'm happy to continue watching. But if this was a stand alone film, I probably wouldn't watch it again to be honest.If you want to see my review on the entire first 6 films, I'll be posting that with my ""Return Of The Jedi"" review so check my page. I'll be giving my opinion on how worth it the rewatch was to me."
Mattias,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"The definitive sci-fi movie. Totally reshaped the genre where the movies are appropriately regarded as 'before Star Wars' or 'after Star Wars'. Best in the original trilogy. The 1997 special edition did not add much content, only effects wizardry."
P97,"Feb 19, 2019",9/10,The one that started it all and thank god that george's wife heavily edited this movie otherwise we would probably get something like the phantom menace.the thing that lucas did great is that he gaved us this wonderful universe and some of the best characters in the history of cinema so us as the fans should always be thankful for what he did.
stefanbe,"Jul 5, 2007",10/10,"I don't think there's any denying that Star Wars changed cinema history and deservedly so. At the time of its release, science-fiction was considered a dead genre with the only major films from Hollywood's recent cannon being the work from Stanley Kubrick and cheesy, yet still fun flicks like Logan's Run. Yet, no other futuristic movie wowed more than George Lucas's space opera. From that infamous opening scroll, featuring that amazing heart-pumping score, to the end credits, people were gripped and hoping their heroes that had grown to know those two previous hours could come out alive. While, George Lucas did give his Jedi knights more adventures, I don't think any of those sequels and certainly not the prequels have managed to come close to the original Star Wars that practically defined the baby boom generation. Watching the film again recently, I am still impressed by the awesome power of the movie and the fact that even after thirty years after its release, it gets me more excited than the latest Hollywood blockbuster. Sorry, Michael Bay, but you're no George Lucas, that's for certain.After two droids crash-land on the desert planet of Tatooine, they are immediately captured and sold to a young farm boy called Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who desperately wants to leave the rock he lives on with his aunt and uncle. While fixing one of the droids, he finds a message from Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), requesting the help of Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness). Luke finds Kenobi, a hermit living in the mountains, who tells Luke of his family history. His father was a Jedi knight, killed by the evil Darth Vader and now Kenobi decides it is time to teach him the way of the Force. After Luke finds his family's home destroyed by stormtroopers looking for the two droids, they decide to find their way to another planet. They enlist the help of space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), who decides to give them a lift. On the way, they find the Death Star, a giant space station run by Darth Vader, with the ability to destroy any planet of the solar system. Now, they must enter the Death Star, find and rescue the Princess and destroy the station before it produces anymore harm.George Lucas has been criticised for his so-called lack of direction and screen writing abilities, but I don't think most people can deny that Star Wars packs a mean punch in terms of solid entertainment. While Star Wars is playing, all eyes are on the screen savouring every delicious moment, whether it be a fantastic lightsaber duel or a quiet scene between Luke and Obi-Wan. The visual effects (including those in the special editions) are seriously some of the best in motion picture history as they manage to make the viewer believe they're in space, surrounded by various creatures and flying ships. Lucas has gotten a lot of negative criticism for the fact that he believes that the updated version of Star Wars is the ultimate way to see the film, but I don't mind. The special effects are better and they certainly do add to the experience. Greedo shooting first? It's such a quick, minor scene that goes by at such a fast rate, that I don't really mind. I understand where the die-hard fans are coming from, but for the casual viewer, it's practically nothing. Adding to the impressive technical delight of Star Wars as well is John Williams's magnificent score, the best in any Hollywood film. I seriously don't think the film would be as highly regarded as it is, if it wasn't for the fantastic music. I seriously would probably enjoy the film even less without it.Yet, I think the lasting appeal of Star Wars has to be the characters. Every child growing up wants to be like Luke Skywalker, the young Jedi who just wants to save the universe from possible destruction. Meanwhile, the older folks in the audience have the wise Obi-Wan Kenobi to relate and as Yoda shows in the other five films, that old age does not remove one of their abilities. Han Solo represents the coolness of Star Wars and Harrison Ford plays him with enough spunk and gusto to warrant what might be a minor character as a personal favourite of mine. And then, there's Darth Vader, the most famous character and the most chilling villain of the 20th century. James Earl Jones will always be connected with with this constantly breathing menace with a past of many hidden secrets. Even the stormtroopers tremble in his wake, for fear that he will force-choke them to death. With thrilling action, impressive visuals, lovable and both frightening characters and a world full of fascination and adventure, it's hard to go wrong with Star Wars, the epic journey of our hearts and inner wants."
BA_Harrison,"Feb 25, 2007",10/10,"There was no way my review of this classic slab of pulp sci-fi was ever going to be anything but glowing; as a nine year old I saw George Lucas' space opera on its original release and instantly became one of a legion of fans who spent the next twenty years worshipping at the altar of the great turkey-necked director (until The Phantom Menace shattered all of my illusions).Thirty years on, and I'm revisiting Star Wars with my two children, hoping that they will fall in love with it as much as I did, way back when all that seemed important was having a bag-full of marbles and a decent sized pile of comics to read.I'm not going to describe the plot (surely you know that!), nor am I going to go into great detail about how Lucas borrowed elements from the movies he loved to bring us his epic about a farm boy who becomes a legendary warrior; all I can say is that the film has lost none of its ability to astound and my kids sat entranced (despite not being able to follow the story without the benefit of some additional info from their sci-fi geek dad). My son (who is only three and a half ) might not understand what a 'rebellion' is, and my daughter (nearly six) may struggle with the concept of 'the force', but both got a kick from witnessing the whole Star Wars universe for the very first time.Chewbacca was an instant hit with my boy, whereas my girl identified with Leia, the gutsy princess. Both of them loved the brilliantly realised landscapes, aliens, robots and spaceships that have wowed film-fans for three decades (and who can blame themthe attention to detail and sheer creativity in design, costume, and make-up is staggering).It has since become evident that old George ain't always the greatest writer or director in the world (the last three Star Wars movies are proof of that); however, when he does get it right, he works miracles (he wrote Raiders of the Lost Ark tooanother solid gold movie).Star Wars is perfect family entertainment that delivers amazing spectacle, unforgettable characters and enough movie magic to last a lifetime. In fact, why not do yourself a favour: get off the internet and go watch it right now (even if you have seen it hundreds of times before)."
TomiusJ,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"Star Wars is the God of all movies. It is the greatest film to have ever been made, bar none. Nothing can be compared to it, nor should it be. It is definitive to our world, our society. It changed the way movies were made: for the better.In the 1970s, there was little unknown director named George Lucas. Little did he know (dispite a nightmarish shoot), that his galactic space opera would literally change the way people lived, worked, played and thought. The secret behind his success? His imagination.The script, the characters, the events, the locations, the humour, the opening, the ending... all perfect.Of course, it's not the most well-shot movie of all time, but there's no denying that nobody actually cares. Star Wars has become a cult and a religion, and earned it's place in my heart as the greatest film to have ever been made......Millions will agree.Whatever I say cannot reach the real truth behind Star Wars: just watch it and you'll know exactly what I mean.The force will be with us, always.Overall: A definitive masterpiece. Will never be forgotten, and will remain in the hearts of young and old for generations. Perfect. (10/10)"
michaelgarykelley1994,"Dec 16, 2013",8/10,"Well, the only way to begin this review is to mention when I saw ""Star Wars"" for the very first time. I was merely a baby, from what I recall my parents telling me before their divorce. I wasn't even born when this first feature film hit theatres. I'm nineteen now, but I must admit that ""Star Wars"" was one of the many things that decorated my childhood. I always adored it, and always looked-up to Luke Skywalker. It was the type of view I can only assume all boys had; we all wanted to be a Luke Skywalker. We wanted to be the cool hero with a lightsaber. In this review, I will do my very best not to give you a biased review. However, forgive me, for I have always been a ""Star Wars"" fanatic. This was my first re-viewing in quite a while, so at least I'm reviewing the film with a clear set of eyes.When two droids, C3-PO and R2-D2, escape the clutches of a shoot-out on a spaceship, they land on a desert-covered landscape, only to find themselves captured as slaves. They are reunited among the slavetraders, called Jawas. The Empire realizes that Princess Leia Organa had sent a message along with one of the droids who managed to escape the attack, so they begin to hunt for R2-D2 and C3-PO. Little does the Empire know that a young man, Luke Skywalker, and his uncle, Owen, had just purchased the two droids from the Jawas. While cleaning the two droids up, Luke stumbles upon the message Princess Leia had left for an ""Obi-Wan Kenobi"". Luke considers ""Obi-Wan"" a possible relative of a man named Ben Kenobi and goes on the look for him. For now, I will end my synopsis for the fact that I just described the first half-hour of the film. I want there to be more for you. All you need to know is that Luke is taken on a journey that changes his entire life and purpose, helping him make a transfer from a teen who longs to leave the ranch he is stuck living on to a man seeking the fall of the Empire. This film isn't just a film; it is a true adventure.When it comes to the acting in ""Star Wars"", I truly don't believe it could get any better whatsoever. Mark Hamill was born to play Luke, Harrison Ford dominated his role as the swift Han Solo (a bounty hunter Luke ends up traveling with), Carrie Fisher is courageously independent as Princess Leia and doesn't fall into the shadows of her co-stars, but Alec Guinness was exceptional as Ben (or Obi-Wan) Kenobi. There is something magical and hopeful about the way Alec portrays Obi-Wan in this film. Also, Anthony Daniels is perfect as C3-PO! He may have been the simple comic relief, but I promise you he was the perfect choice for this character. I truly cannot see anyone ever playing this golden-plated character, who has practically become the symbol for any outsider who may have not seen the films. Without a doubt, the acting was exceptional in all respects. I believe the trickiest had to have been David Prowse, seeing as how Lucas ended-up not using Prowse's real voice for Darth Vader. With that thought, I must say that I enjoy James Earl Jones' voice much more for the character.Anyways, moving along! The writing of each character was phenomenal. I feel that the banter was so well-done that it brings these characters to life even more, seeing the situations each of them are in within the duration of the film. ""Star Wars"" was also plotted very well, with all events and scenes not feeling out of place once.The special effects, I must say, are top-notch, even if they have aged a bit in 2013 viewer's eyes. At some points, the effects look fantastic, while other scenes look like a ""Star Wars"" fan film from YouTube. That's common with classic cinema, so I don't mind it. I sincerely believe that people aren't the only ones to age.This ""Star Wars"" film is definitely not my favorite, but it runs right behind ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi"", on my list. Overall, it is still very enjoyable with set designs that look like legitimate places amongst the galaxy. The detailing of the sets in this film are just shockingly realistic.""Star Wars"" deserves the eight stars that I have rated it. I like it, hold it as a memory in my heart, but find it to be an action-fantasy film, for the most part. It is brilliant, it is intelligent, and it is worth a try. I highly recommend the film.May the force be with you all! God bless, and Merry Christmas!"
tedg,"Sep 29, 2002",N/A,"I recently revisited this, and remembered first seeing it.It wasn't the first movie to be heavily hyped. But I recall it as the first one to appeal to kids as a big adventure.In a couple ways, what's come since have ruined this. Lucas himself ruined it by deciding to make all those extra ones, making up the story as he went. And of course, every month on average we now have a new special effects movie that matches the star wars franchise in visual ambition. Many of these in fact are fueled by Lucas' several companies.So its impossible to recapture that thrill. At the time, yes we knew he stole from Kurosawa, and leaned heavily on Joseph Campbell's notions of myth. But it all seemed so fresh, and Lucas himself came across as a visionary genius. And we needed that more than we needed entertainment.Remember, the US had just been through its first sleazy republican scandal and the nation as a whole was discouraged. But the world of movies was exploding. Woody Allen gave us ""Annie Hall."" Scorcese became known. And then this. The thing that impressed us at the time was how seriously it took itself, despite how childishly goofy that intergalactic bar was. Also how powerful the sounds and images were.The mythology was so clear. We had it for decades in science fiction and fantasy novels, indeed much better. But this was the first time we had them cinematically, and cinema when it works may be the most powerful of packaged imaginations. Oh how I wish we could see it as we did then.Now we notice, for instance, how ordinary the dogfights are. These used to thrill. We don't have all the mystery that made the thing deep. Now we know who everyone is and what is going on, and it is all so much more ordinary than what we imagined at the time as possibilities.In later years, Lucas would let us down, as a person and in this saga. In fact, I think he ruined some things. But for the year of this event, he was the most celebrated singer in the choir. And by me as well.What do I mean about ruining?Things evolve. When one thing finds a niche and flourishes, it pinches off other things. When ""Birth of a Nation"" became a huge success, it froze movies as filmed plays with a larger stage instead of one of the several other directions it could have taken.Again, there was a period after talkies reinvented the medium where there was a struggle among various different directions. This you can clearly see in the period. In retrospect, it appears as if the world could have only turned out the way it did. But the trends that win aren't the best at all.So ""Star Wars"" opened up a gateway for how effects could transform cinema into something far beyond what we had before. And then it closed that gateway, so that effects now cannot show you something unfamiliar. Instead, it all has to be the familiar taken to some extreme.Yes, it was a goose at the time. But Star Wars killed the greater possibilities of science fiction. In film, at least, and because books are inherently cinematic now, in books too.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
TheCinephileENTP,"Nov 19, 2016",6/10,"So..this is Star Wars? One of the so called ''greatest films ever made''? Well, this is underwhelming. Star Wars is not a bad movie, but I do not believe this is at the level or Citizen Kane or The Seventh Seal. It's just so average. You know, I can see why this has a fanbase, but this fanbase has hyped it to hell. The acting was adequate,the metaphors and subtext were so obvious it hurts, and the effects were meh. I cannot understand why people praise the visuals in this film as being landmark and revolutionary. 2001: A Space Odyssey, released 9 years before, has effects that look much better and hold up today. Star Wars looks 1977. Kubrick's masterpiece looks like it could be released any day. It's absolutely beautiful and timeless. Star Wars is just so annoyingly overrated. I don't hate it, I enjoyed it somewhat. But, I think I'll watch some Ingmar Bergman or Orson Welles to enjoy myself before considering giving Star Wars a rewatch."
johnboy121,"Feb 20, 2005",10/10,"This was quite possibly the greatest film of all time, I agree the acting was somewhat lacking, but the effects were beyond amazing, you got to remember, this was 1977. Lucas' vision was realized to its full potential and William's score carried the film to being the most successful film ever made, behind the hunk of crap titanic. The story was one the most original I've ever come across and the movie itself sparked the career of Harrison Ford, quite possibly one of the biggest actors in the 1980's and 90's. Although this was the first and last original Star Wars film to be directed by Lucas, it was quite possibly the best film to hit the market in the 1970's."
GgeronimoSstilton,"Jun 13, 2021",6/10,Good film and very interesting plot however penalized by the days when it was shot because of bad special effects and not excellent acting. 61\100.
kon-tiki-2,"May 14, 1999",1/10,"I liked this movie when it first came out.  As a teenager, I saw it about seven or eight times (there was nothing else to do on weekends.)  About twenty years went by before I saw it again, on cable.  How time dulls the memory!  ""Star Wars"" now has an odd, nauseating effect on me: the 70's haircuts, laughable costumes, cheesy dialog, fake visual effects, corny music, uninteresting soap-opera plot... (I could go on and on.) I sat there, before the flickering screen, enveloped in ""Star Wars'"" suffocating stupidity, wondering how in the hell I could ever have liked this thing. I finally came to my senses and turned the channel after hearing John Williams' irritating ""Darth Vader"" theme for the 600th time in the first 40 minutes. Why George Lucas decided we needed to hear this high-volume musical cue EVERY time we see Darth Vader on screen is beyond me.  Maybe he just thinks his audience is extremely stupid and is incapable of remembering that Darth Vader is supposed to be evil.  I don't know...It would be easy to dismiss this movie as nothing but fluff to entertain kids (because that's all it is, and all it was ever intended to be) but unfortunately, for many people, this thing has become their religion. Folks, get a life before it's too late! It's just a movie."
indnajns,"Apr 20, 2008",8/10,"Of all the movies I've ever seen at the theater, I remember this one the most. Not the actual movie really. I remember coming OUT of the theater. Why? Because we had just seen THE final frontier! We had seen space ships! We had seen other worlds! And not in black and white '50s style sci-fi. This was full color with incredible computer generated graphics. There were real live BELIEVABLE aliens up on the screen! We were flying at light speed across galaxies and star systems! And then the movie was over, the house lights came up, and we had to WALK on CONCRETE to our FOSSIL FUELED vehicles and DRIVE on ASPHALT to get home. How B-O-R-I-N-G. How mundane. I had just seen the future, and then when I left the theater it was all jerked away from me. I'll never forget that feeling. The disappointment of ""reality"". I've never experienced it with any other movie since, not even any of the other Star Wars episodes. I guess I was just the right age at the right time.At the time I hated Han Solo. Now that I'm ""all grown up"" I love Harrison Ford and it's Luke and Leiah that make me cringe. But this really was a special movie. The gateway to a whole new wave of movie making. (for better or worse)"
joshuadrake-39480,"Apr 27, 2015",10/10,"STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE is a film that I really enjoyed when I first saw it and I knew from the beginning I would love it and this was the first in a much bigger series and the fourth film in the STAR WARS franchise overall (in chronological order).The story is amazing for a 2 hour film and the film does not feel like it's 2 hours because it goes by really quick and I really think it's just amazing and spectacular and fantastically well-made and there are reasons why it is the best movie of all time and it's the best film ever made.THE CHARACTERS: Luke Skywalker is our main protagonist and he is played by Mark Hamill and he is really spectacular. He is my favorite character, along with Yoda, Chewbacca, Princess Leia, Han Solo, Darth Vader, C3PO and R2D2, Mace Windu, Padme, Obi-Wan Kenobi and Emperor Palpatine.Hamill does not fail in anything and his performance was really great and just amazing. Carrie Fisher was really fantastic as Princess Leia and she is not the normal damsel-in-distress in today's movies and she was the right choice for the character. Harrison Ford is really nice as Han Solo and all three actors would later become famous for their roles in these films and they really do a very well good job.Harrison Ford would play both Han Solo in the original STAR WARS trilogy and Indiana Jones in the INDIANA JONES franchise, which I will get to.The next performance is the late Alec Guiness in the best role of his career as Obi-Wan Kenobi and he should have won an Oscar for his part. Anthony Daniels, Kenny Baker and Peter Mayhew plays C3PO, R2-D2 and Chewbacca in this film and they do a really outstanding job.George Lucas does a very good job creating an epic space opera series that starts off with the middle of the series and that is not possible in today's film making world, but was possible for 1977 and he does a very good job writing and directing and the screenplay he wrote is one of the best screenplays that I have ever read before in my life.John Williams composed one of the greatest musical scores ever created for a film and his Star Wars theme song is one of my favorite musical themes ever credits.The visual effects back then were amazing and so were the lightsaber battles and the dogfight sequences and they were really cool back in 1977 and it was really cool and just amazingly created and today, they still look amazingly well-done. I have seen the 1997 special edition of this film and I think it is really good, but I also love the theatrical version is just really cool and just fantastic.Overall, I love STAR WARS EPISODE IV: A NEW HOPE and the movie is getting a 10 out of 10 from me because everything is just really great and fantastic to inspire a lot of filmmakers including Christopher Nolan, Joss Whedon, Ridley Scott, James Cameron, John Singleton, Dean Devlin and Peter Jackson and it also inspired future filmmakers including myself.It's a smash hit, 10/10."
SmileysWorld,"Mar 13, 2005",9/10,"This film came along at just the right time for me.Upon it's initial release in 1977,I was 12 years old,which is the perfect age to see something this eye opening and different.I remember sitting and watching with just as much awe and amazement as perhaps 12 year olds from past generations seeing their first cowboy movie.I remember the thrills as though I saw it fresh yesterday.Upon seeing it again recently for the first time in many years,now well into my adulthood,I find,unfortunately,that the thrill that came with my first viewing did not come with me across the years.Despite this fact,I still saw a great film,one worthy of any home library.It's suspenseful,thrilling,and contains a great story line and interesting characters that we care about.It was great looking back on Harrison Ford when his hair wasn't quite so gray,Mark Hamill,whom we all thought would go on to be a great film star,though he has done little beyond this trilogy,Carrie Fisher, and,at least in voice,James Earl Jones(Darth Vader).Though the initial childhood thrill is gone,this is still a great film."
deloudelouvain,"Apr 6, 2020",6/10,"After so many years of postponing I finally decided to watch all the Star Wars movies. Since there are different ways to watch it I'm going for the chronological order and not the release date order, that just makes more sense to me. Maybe I watched a couple movies when I was young, I probably did, but I don't remember anything about it so to me it's all new and maybe one day I will understand the whole hype about the Star Wars saga. After watching The Phantom Menace, Attack Of The Clones and Revenge Of The Sith, Solo: A Star Wars Story, and Rogue One, it's now time for A New Hope. I get it that it's the oldest one and so the special effects are not of the same level as more recent ones but from all the ones I watched by now I thought this was the weakest one. I probably watched it as a kid and gave up after that as it's just not that good. I don't know why this one gets such a high rating, it's definitely not better than any of the previous titles mentioned. I agree that the used special effects at that time might have looked good for 1977 but still it doesn't make it better. For that the story and the acting were just not of the same quality. By watching the saga in chronological order you appreciate every movie better than in order by release date. It's just a better way to watch the whole saga, it's much easier to follow and for somebody new to it like me it's just much more appealing.The Star Wars saga is great because of the different characters, races of aliens, and the different spaceships and weapons, for that I just love it. I can't wait to watch the next one, will probably binge watch the eleven movies and will probably squeeze The Mandalorian between it, as long as the chronological order is respected. This was the sixth movie of eleven in barely 48 hours for me, next one today will be The Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi in the hope the quality improves compared to this one, looking forward to it."
Daniel_Souza,"Feb 24, 2006",1/10,"When I first saw Star Wars I find it great. Really. I was 11.It's amazing how 40 year old people can enjoy Star Wars. Why? What this movie has it for you to enjoy it so much after you have pubic hair.Maybe it's just like those things you like because reminds you of your childhood. No more than that.I'm rating it 1 because it is a great movie for children, not everyone. So with all those people rating 10 I'm giving some balance.It has the classic bad guy ""-I want to take over the universe"" the typical good guy ""-I need to save the universe"" and robots and laser guns.Rent it for you kid, but don't tell me it's a classic for adults."
valjoemv-1,"Jun 26, 2005",10/10,"When Episode IV came out I was not even born. I guess I was too young to see Episodes V & VI. So my brother and grew up with it on the TV screen. When The Special Edition was getting released into theaters my brother and I were like ""We HAVE to see them!"" So on opening day my brother and I got in line at Tinseltown 290 in Houston to buy four tickets. Standing behind me is a Cinemark employee dressed as Darth Vader. I don't know why I laughed at that moment. We originally wanted the 10:45pm showing but it was sold out and they added an extra showing at 1am. So at 1am myself, my brother, our Dad and our aunt went to see it. The lights went out and some guy behind us yelled ""Chewie!"". You those familiar drums then the Fox logo. Then Lucas Film Ltd the people applauded. Then ""A long time ago in a galaxy far, far away."" There was silence for that. Then the ""Star Wars"" came on the screen the theater applauded loudly. It was great. My brother and I agree George Lucas is a genius. Such imagination. He deserved that AFI Life Acchievment Award this year. George Lucas joins the ranks of Steven Spielberg, James Cameron, Peter Jackson among others as a great director. Way to go George!"
dsilverman,"Jun 26, 2005",10/10,"After seeing the latest and last Star Wars (Episode 3), I wondered if the first was as good as I remembered it, or had I just gotten tired of all things Star Wars. Tonight we watched the DVD of the first one (The New Hope or Episode 4, as its now called). What a contrast! Real people, real feelings and emotions, humor, adventure, The Cantina Bar, Luke getting in touch with the Force within, Han Solo's sarcasm, Obiwan's wisdom...Alec Guiness brings a depth to the role lacking in the recent movies....but then again, all of these elements seem lacking in the recent movies. The first one is still a gem! Lucas should have stopped here."
fishmeister,"Jun 2, 2004",10/10,"This is quite simply a masterpiece.By far the film that has progressed the film industry the farthest. This is the breakthrough in films. This film set raised the benchmark for standard of films that is still not being reached by many films today, almost 30 years on.This introduces us to our characters and sets the story for out trilogy. A little slow to get started i grant you. An exciting opening scene is followed by what to my mind is a little too much of Threepio and Artoo traipsing through the dunes of Tatooine. After that though it is a non stop ride of action, adventure, drama and comedy. The excitement of learning about the force will never be surpassed and never has an idea been so gripping.Watch this film if you only watch one film in your life. Of course if you are only going to watch one film in your like then after seeing this i am afraid that will drastically be changed into only watching 6 films in your life!!!"
DarthBill,"Jun 9, 2004",10/10,"The one that started it all...Spunky Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) is captured by the evil, satanic bastard known as Darth Vader (body of British weight lifting champion David Prowse, also the same man who trained Christopher Reeve for 1978's ""Superman - the Movie""; voice of James Earl Jones) and exposed as a traitor to the evil empire that has enslaved the galaxy and is challenged by a heroic Rebellion. Two of Leia's robots, the hapless C-3P0 (Anthony Daniels) and the handy R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) escape the ship and crash land on the desert wasteland planet known as Tatioone. After being captured by Jawas (Hobbit like people who wear cloaks) and traded to a farmer known as Owen Lars, his wife Beru and their nephew Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill, the future voice of the Joker). Luke is a callow youth who would like nothing more than to leave Tatioone and find adventure in the universe, then he stumbles upon a message in R2 from Leia asking for the help of an Obi-Wan Kenobi, AKA: Ben Kenobi (Alec Guinness). Luke doesn't know anyone named Obi-Wan Kenobi but he knows a strange old hermit man named Ben Kenobi but is unaware that Obi-Wan & Ben are the same man. When R2 sneaks off in the night, Luke and 3P0 chase him down in the day and are attacked by Sand People AKA: Tusken Raiders. When the Sand People try to raid Luke's hover-car, they are scared off by Ben Kenobi, who reveals himself to Luke to be Obi-Wan Kenobi and Luke tells him that R2 claims to be his property and has a message for him. Obi-Wan checks out the message and we find out that he was once a great Jedi Knight and that he was a friend of Luke's father, the late Anakin Skywalker, who was also a great Jedi Knight but one who, as far as Luke knows died of mysterious circumstances; actually, according to Obi-Wan, Anakin was murdered by O's former pupil, ""a young Jedi named Darth Vader."" Luke, however, has yet to discover the horrible truth behind it all... well, Luke is later persuaded to help Obi-Wan and study the way of the Force, which is what gives a Jedi his power (it helps that the Imperial Storm Troopers mutilated his aunt and uncle while he was out). Luke, Obi-Wan and the robots head off to Mos Eisly space port where they join forces with rogue pilot Han Solo (Harrison Ford in the role that made him a star) and his wookie companion Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). Though they're supposed to go the planet of Alderaan, they are intercepted by the Death Star, a giant space station orb that blows planets up real good and was responsible for the destroying Alderaan before our heroes could get there. Once on board the Death Star, our heroes rescue Princess Leia and get into all sorts of hijinx that will change their lives forever.Obi-Wan is tragically killed in a duel with his former student, Darth Vader. In the rousing finale, Luke, Han and Chewbacca become big time heroes for destroying the Death Star. The adventure, however, is only beginning.Well acted, great special effects in both the original theatrical version and the over done special edition, the classic ""Star Wars"" trilogy is a masterpiece that, for better or worse, helped usher in the age of the blockbuster. Well acted all around by Mark, Harry (as in Harrison Ford), Carrie, Alec and Peter Cushing (as the other villain), but Ford steals the show as Han Solo, the great Rapscallion of the Universe.""You're all clear kid now let's blow this thing and go home!"" - Han Solo"
brandonennals,"Dec 17, 2004",10/10,"This was it! When I was growing up, this was the best and more influential movie of my childhood. Classic good versus evil tale. I love watching this even more now that newer episodes have been releasing. Their are a lot of references to what is going on in the new movies. This movie is a classic and ranks as one of my favorite movies. I love the story lines and for its time, the visuals were incredible. I watch other movies that came out around the same time as this movie, and visually, you cant even compare them. This was a movie that raised the bar. Nothing felt forced even though many movies were going to be spun off of this one. One of the greatest heroes and villains in the same movie. Everything about this movie is great, even if it is a little cheesy."
kantvors,"Aug 29, 2019",7/10,"This movie immediately captures your attention with an incredible starting sequence after which you're left wondering what is going on. It sets up not just the story at hand, but a whole world far, far away. What makes this movie shine are the memorable settings, characters and locations. The effects were ahead of its time, but have not aged well. This shows the most during fight scenes. They are not choreographed very well and look just like a couple of old dudes trying to punch each other with sticks. It's done so much better in the prequels, less so in the new movies. The lightsabers feel like a traditional novelty more than like a weapon feared by the galaxy. What the movie does very well are its twists and pacing. Highly recommended, but not nearly as good a watch today compared to the prequels, which you should start with in my opinion."
artemis_5,"Feb 3, 2004",9/10,"""Star Wars"" became a movie classic because it was intelligent science fiction that went beyond what had been done before in the genre.  Lucas' space opera incorporated themes from world mythologies into a movie that both adults and children could appreciate.  The result was a franchise that had both popular and intellectual appeal.  I have heard college students discuss the Star Wars trilogy as if it were the ""Illiad"", and it does not seem silly at all for them to do so.What was the appeal of ""Star Wars.""  The first film in what is now sometimes referred to as ""the original trilogy"" (to distinguish it from the prequel trilogy) introduced the movie audience to ""the force,"" which had both a dark side and a light side; as well as a ""will"".  The universe at the beginning of Star Wars is controlled by an evil Empire, which is in turn being resisted by the ""Alliance.""  The movie begins with the capture of an Alliance ship by an Imperial cruiser.  As the movie's villain, Darth Vader, boards the ship in search of secret plans stolen by the Alliance, two droids (including one who has the missing plans) jettison to the surface of the planet around which the Alliance cruiser was orbiting.  There they encounter a young farmer (Luke Skywalker), whose father (Anakin Skywalker) was a pilot in the ""Clone Wars"" (an important war, as we later find out), and an aging jedi knight named Obi Wan Kenobi (the jedi's having the power to use ""the force"" for combat and enlightenment).  As the movie progresses, the jedi knight teaches the young farmer the jedi skills, and they join forces with a blockade runner named Han Solo and a princess named Leia, to fight the evil Empire.This movie brilliantly sets the stage for events that occur during the next two films, but you have to see the entire trilogy to fully appreciate Lucas' contribution.**Note: While it might be tempting in light of the release of the prequel trilogy to see them first, I think that it is best to see the original first, with the prequel trilogy filling in the gaps later."
avocado99,"Nov 6, 2022",7/10,"Star Wars is very impressive for its time. The story is easy to follow, some scenes are unnecessarily long and some dialogue could have been left out to make the film more compact and re-watchable.Before watching Star Wars I had seen Amercian Graffiti from 1973 and I find it amazing how George Lucas went from a coming-of-age teen film to a sci-fi epic in just a few years, truly inspiring.It goes without saying that this is a trailblazing film, but the re-released version with forced CGI sadly makes it feel less like a 70s movie. Overall quite legendary. Luke and Leia are the best characters."
hanxero,"Sep 25, 2004",N/A,"I have been reading some of the comments on this movie that some people have been putting up and frankly, I'm not happy. I know that there are a lot of flaws in this movie but so what? This is still a great movie. I've read comments on how the special effects suck and such. This just shows how ignorant some people are. The special effects in this movie were ground breaking. George Lucas basically founded modern special effects on this movies. If it were not for Star Wars there would probably be no LOTR. Which brings me to my next issue. I read someone comparing Star Wars with LOTR. They commented on how Star Wars sort of ripped off Gandalf using Obi Wan. WRONG! Gandalf and Obi Wan are both inspired by the ""old wise man"" template. That's right, I hate to break it to ya but Gandalf was not the original ""old wise man"". If George Lucas had never made Star Wars then he would probably never have started ILM (Industrial Light and Magic). Which would have set back the special effects in movies by decades. Meaning that without Star Wars there would be no LOTR. I am not saying I don't like LOTR because I love it. Comparing the movies Star Wars and LOTR is like comparing the authors Tolkien and Robert Jordan. It simply should not be done. I think Star Wars is a great movie and It deserves to be in the top ten. So before you try and comment on how bad this movie is try and realize where the special effects in the movie industry would be if it were not for this movie."

C3PO is painfully annoying. There's really just nothing about this that I find enjoyable.It's Super Mario Bros but with lasers and spaceships. Save in princess... IN SPACE! I want more from my movies, and especially from my sci-fi."
Spondonman,"Nov 10, 2013",8/10,"I saw this marvellously old-fashioned hokum with my girlfriend at the packed out Pics on March 25th 1978. Exhausted at all the screen wipes by the end all we were thinking of was hopefully not waiting too long in the cold for the last bus home; so much for intergalactic travel. Star Wars was a phenomena then, and still is – although I did warn a big fan I knew at the time that it wouldn't take too long for the special effects to go dog-eared with age and even recommended Kurosawa's original to him instead. However, he probably still disdainfully thinks, along with many others that movies, indeed history, began with Star Wars.Young stereotype joins forces with a disparate group of stereotypes to save the white universe and Princess Stereotype from stereotypical space baddies in a adventurous story bordering on corny with then innovative now dated film technology. Definitely nothing wrong with any of that, just that when stripped down it's not only incredible but incredibly ordinary and merely reflects back to me some lovely sunny days from the mid '70's. Even the sinister ugly aliens had somehow listened to the cleaner music of Frank Zappa. Fancy spending trillions of trillions on an immense battleship complete with a titchy flue with a security implication. I saw Lucas's 90's cgi cartoonery revision at the Pics with my daughter, the spacecraft still wobbled and there were many white borders on display but overall his team had done a good job trying to stem the onslaughts of Time on his cash cow. Many of my favourite films are pure - and poor - old fashioned corn but no one on planet Earth thinks they're life changing works of Art in the same way as they do this monument to Luck.The film I saw was Part I full stop; if Disney ever gets to Part XXVII what if they want to do a prequel to the prequel and more pathetic re-numbering and retrospective digital title re-jigging ensues, will Lucas let them? I've always favoured the originals of anything generally and also draw the line at altering future history.I enjoy it immensely whenever it's on UK TV, as I can feel the persuasive Force of not having to think for a couple of hours and to simply enjoy the ride."
brockhunt34,"Sep 27, 2013",10/10,"Brock Hunt Mr.Hicks ENG 101-008 September 20, 2013A Space OperaStar Wars is a movie which focuses on a rebel alliance that fights against an oppressive regime set in a fictionalized universe a long time ago in a galaxy far far away. We're introduced to the main characters Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) and Darth Vader (David Prowse) for the first time. Luke is a farm boy who doesn't have a clue of what is about to happen. Darth Vader is an evil dark lord of the Sith who is trained in the dark side of the force and wants to defeat the rebel alliance. After Luke's family is murdered by the empire, he trains to be a Jedi by Obi-Wan Kenobi to defeat the evil Galactic Empire.George Lucas made Star Wars: A New Hope in 1976 and was released in the summer of 1977. He made episode four first because the story didn't require any high dollar special effects and wasn't sure how the movie would be accepted. When the movie opened, it received great reviews and audiences were amazed at the special effects. He would go on to direct the following sequels Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. Little do people know that George Lucas had the stories and screenplays of episodes one, two, and three already done before episode four was ever released. He did this because at the time technology didn't exist to produce the first three films with the fight sequences and settings that were in the first three films.I personally love the Star Wars films because of my personal connection with them. My grandmother introduced me to the Star Wars franchise as a child. On Saturday nights I would stay with my grandmother and she would play the movies on VHS. I never get tired of watching the films. Because every time I do, it takes me back in time when she was alive. Star Wars also opened up my interest in Sci-Fi movies. Some can say I'm a nerd but most don't know my extensive knowledge of the Star Wars franchise."
genstarzz,"Oct 15, 2013",10/10,"This film is a milestone in cinema. It changed the way movies were made with its ground breaking special effects. It launched the Star Wars saga, one of the most successful film franchises of all time. Along with Jaws, it essentially created the blockbuster genre, and on top of all that, many aspects of this film are now a cultural icons (The John Williams theme, The Millennium Falcon, The Death Star, Darth Vader, Chewbacca, Lightsabers, C-3PO and R2D2 and so much more!)However, even if you took away this film's impact on both Cinema and the world, you would still have a very enjoyable thrill ride in the science fiction/fantasy genre! A lot of elements of Star Wars are a bit cliché: The orphan protagonist who goes from average Joe to hero, the wise mentor, the non violent duo put in for comic relief, the anti hero, the dark threatening villain and the princess. However, what makes Star Wars so great is how likable it makes it's heroes, how intimidating it makes it's antagonists and the unique spin Star Wars puts on these otherwise cliché factors.Enter Luke Skywalker! He's a little whiny at first, but you can't help but get behind him. Mark Hamill's performance definitely helps, but it's also the character's sheer compassion and determination to become a part of something bigger that makes him so relatable. You can't help but sympathize with him as his Uncle Owen holds him back from leaving the farm. Luke also has a firm belief in the force and places a lot of faith in it.Complementing Luke's character is that of Han Solo. Han has far less compassion, and refuses to put any faith in the force. He is certainly more a bad ass in traditional sense and is on the other end of the ""hero"" spectrum. This is great because it gives the audience options on who they'd like to get behind. If Luke is too much a boy scout, you still have Han to get behind. If Han is too pig headed and selfish, then you have Luke to get behind! Not to mention, Mark Hamill and Harrison Ford have great on screen chemistry.Darth Vader is done so well as antagonist that he's arguably the most iconic villain of all time, perhaps tied with the Joker. Everything from the unique mask he wears to the size and stature of David Prowse (the actor inside the suit)accompanied by the voice of James Earl Jones gives Darth Vader a highly intimidating presence. However, what makes him interesting and gives him more depth is that he was once good, but was seduced by the dark side of the force and is now evil. He was a victim of his temptations.Alec Guinness is a brilliant actor and makes Obi-wan Kenobi very likable as well very well spoken and wise. It's very easy to see him as a wise Jedi Master. Princess Leia is a damsel in distress, but she's also tougher than the average one and isn't afraid to take charge.Aside from the great characters, Star Wars just introduces a very distinct and unique universe. There are so many great vehicle and character designs that are imaginative, interesting and original. All of these things keep Star Wars from being anything from generic. Then there's the pacing of the film. The film starts off with a great attention grabbing introduction, then the film starts to slow down a bit for exposition, but then the film becomes a roller coaster ride throughout the entire second half! The action is very thrilling and leaves a big impression.Overall, Star Wars still holds up today as a great film. It hasn't aged a bit; non of it's special effects look dated or silly, the characters are still very likable and soundtrack is just epic. Star Wars, in my opinion is the definition of a timeless film. It is now 36 years old and is still better than the vast majority of blockbuster films that have been released within the last year, if not all of them! Star Wars lives up to it's name of simply being a great film."
cdiasmd,"Mar 16, 2004",10/10,"This movie was the first (and only) movie I ever obsessed about.  I was 11-years old and it is still the greatest movie experience I ever had. Nothing has come close.  It was the first cast I ever memorized and I still know the soundtrack like the back of my hand.  I can't explain why.It was a combination of the old, Peter Cushing, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness; and the new, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil, Carrie Fisher. The special effects are STILL awesome.  The story is timeless and fresh some 27 years later.It's just such a great movie to get lost in...still."
MostMajestic,"Jan 13, 2000",10/10,"This film has no weaknesses.Other films may be better at other aspects but those films OVERALL cannot beat ""Star Wars"" as of now.The closest rival is ""The Empire Strikes Back"" which production wise was a better film,but even that has a weakness if one really tries to find one in that the story would not be as appreciated if one did not watch ""Star Wars"".This film had it all.Walt Disney fantasy at the same time cult no compromise brutality and pulled it off.It had horror,suspense,mystery,romance,action,drama,comedy,magic,science, religion,past,future,Shakespeare,production,acting,movie stars,respected actors,story and entertainment!Nobody can even mess with the movie music!"
wilbursmith,"Jul 25, 2018",N/A,"A New Hope (1977): Much has been said about A new hope and I do not need to add to it except for the fact that this film is fantastic- well paced and featuring the appearance of so many memorable characters and scenes. Lucas as a young man sure had an eye for details and it's a pity how he lost this ability by the time he started filming the prequels. The locations, atmosphere and camerawork is so different than the later films it is hard to imagine they were both directed by the same man. Anyway if you haven't already then please watch A new hope and then slowly make your way through the entire saga."
mcshortfilm,"Aug 19, 2005",7/10,"A few years ago, the New Yorker magazine wrote a fascinating article on Star Wars. It explained the whole phenomenon of Star Wars and how it happened. I was like other 5 year old ""Star Wars"" fanatics in 1977 and when I saw the Millennium Falcon zap into hyper-drive, it was an overwhelming stimulation of the imagination. Suddenly every 4 and 5 year old child was teleported into a future that existed long ago and in a galaxy far away. ""Star Wars' gave reason to why we see movies in a big and darkened theater. Yes, Star Wars was a phenomenon but it was not THE film changed the movie industry. That was Jaws.Star Wars's greatest achievement is that the film was such a grand and ambitious project and yet, writer, director George Lucas was able to realize it. No other science fiction film has had so many creatures, planets and special effects as Star Wars. It is a universe in and of itself. Looking back on ""Star Wars"" many year later, I can see problems that seemed to permeate in the other films from the saga. Don't get me wrong, Star Wars is a masterpiece, that is up until the story leads Luke and the others into the Death Star. By that point, the film turns into an exaggerated cartoon. When Han Solo is chasing after an army of stormtroopers, we get the idea that he's really not that scared. Okay, he's scared but not to the point where his life is at risk. We see this type of problem in all the Star Wars films (with the exception of ""The Empire Strikes Back""). Characters are running around shooting each other like a bunch of kids playing tag. Where's the suspense and drama that leads us to believe that this is supposed to be real? It worked for the first half of Star Wars.The first hour of Star Wars is beautifully written. One of my favorite scenes is when Luke and Obi-Wan are sitting at Obi Wan's home. Obi wan is talking about the past and also talking about Luke's father and the ""force"" which is an ""energy field created by all living things."" This conversation is one of the moments of the film that always enhanced my imagination for the film. I not only believed in the film, but I also believed that there was all of this history and supernatural elements that existed prior to this film. Too bad, the history was later realized into another series of cartoonishly dull adventures in the Episode I, II, and III. Oh well. It is after all the imagination come to life that makes all of these films important. That's what counts. The rest is mediocre."
TOMASBBloodhound,"Apr 11, 2004",10/10,"If there is one thing about my childhood I can be thankful for, it's the fact that I was a boy between 1977 and 1983. I got to grow up with three of the most inspirational fantasy films ever made. It all started with Star Wars Episode IV in 1977.We all know the story about this battle between the forces of good represented by a fragmented rebel alliance and the forces of evil represented by an intergalactic EMPIRE. And yes, my sister and I had all of the toys, clothes, sleeping bags, trading cards, etc...Let's just focus this review on the last twenty or so minutes of the film. Perhaps the greatest and most inspiring scenes in film history. I'm talking about the rebel assault on the approaching Death Star.Who couldn't be moved by a dozen or so tiny ships flying out to face this massive battle station positioning itself to wipe out their entire army tucked away on a little moon. How about the shot of these ships locking their wings in attack position with the giant Death Star looming in front of them?Some really neat camera shots as the battle begins. The rebels seem to be wreaking some havoc in their concentrated attack, until Darth Vader and some Imperial fighters join the battle. The rebel fighters are searching for a tiny ventilation shaft to drop some ""proton torpedoes"" into. It seems this is the only vulnerable point on this massive space station. One of the fighters actually gets a good shot at it...We get a shot from inside the Death Star. Moff Tarkin (played superbly by veteran horror film actor Peter Cushing) is approached by one of his underlings.""Sir, we've analyzed their attack pattern and there IS a danger. Should we have your shuttle standing by?""Tarkin's over-confident reply:""Evacuate? In our moment of triumph? I think you overestimate their chances!""The battle rages on. Most of the rebel ships are blown to bits. It looks like Luke Skywalker will be one of them also until...""You're all clear kid, now let's blow this thing and go home!""Luke, without the aid of his targeting computer, takes one last shot. The Death Star has the moon with the rebel base in sight...Luke lets out a sigh of relief as his torpedoes drop down the shaft...Tarkin gives the order to fire:""You may fire when ready.""We get a shot of about four remaining rebel ships turning towards home.We hear a technician inside the Death Star:""Stand by...""BOOM!!!!!!!!!!We see the gleeful medal ceremony back at the rebel base.Thank You George Lucas!!!!I'd give it a million of ten stars if I could.So sayeth the Hound."
MONA0825,"Sep 18, 2011",6/10,"I felt in love with the Star wars movie saga when these movies were released again to movie theaters in 1997. I was just a teenager back then. I just watched them again in Blu-ray and some of the old excitement is gone. I guess almost 15 years of becoming familiar with great directors and great movies and also with Sci-Fi/Fantasy works done before 1977 have made me unable to close eyes to what is wrong with Star Wars. Though the movie is still a fantastic entertainment in a childish way, it has some of the worst dialogue I've ever heard in a screen –big or small- and terrible acting. Luke Skywalker is the archetypical hero and the character has great potential. However, Mr. Hamill wasn't skilled or talented enough to flesh out the character as it was written paper thin. As result, poor Luke is just a whining teenager. Harrison Ford fares much better as the rogue space cowboy because he was a very charismatic person not because he was the best of actors. Carrie Fisher is equally flat as princess Leia. Only Peter Cushing saves the day with decent acting as well as the powerful voice of Mr. Jones. The direction is mediocre but serviceable. The soundtrack sounds better than ever in its Wagnerian intensity and use of motifs. Watch it for old time's sake. Luckily, Empire Strikes back holds the passing of time much better."
j30bell,"Mar 10, 2005",3/10,"The best film ever made, period! Allow me to take a contrary view. Not the best film ever made (Les Enfants du Paradis, The Godfather, The Bicycle Thief). Not the best science fiction film (2001, Bladerunner, Gattaca, Code 46) Not even the best film about periods (Carrie).Star Wars brought two things to the audience for the first time; decent sound and visual production and mass marketed toy tie-ins. The first is laudable; the second is where you suspect George Lucus' real talent lies.Like most adults in their early thirties, I got my first taste of Star Wars when I was too young to know better. We were too poor to afford the cinema then, so I watched it on the small screen and still liked it. But now I know better. Star Wars contains some of the hammiest, crummiest dialogue ever uttered by respectable actors. ""Feel the force, Luke!"" Yeah, whatever. If that wasn't enough, Lucas then went back and mucked up that tiny amount character consistency which made it out of the first cut.Star Wars, made at the height of the Cold War and the nadir of American foreign policy, is the good ole story of good ole America spreading its good ole values against a dark, satanic empire. Sound familiar? It's also the story of a poor orphan boy who runs away, rescues a beautiful princess and saves a kingdom from an oppressive tyranny. Sound familiar? Oh yes, and on the way he meets an old man with strange powers, an untrustworthy adventurer and a band of rebels hiding in a forest. Sound familiar? Of course, there is a reason for this. A simple reason. A long time ago in, well, America, Mr Lucas picked up a copy of Campbell's A Hero with a Thousand Faces. This book outlines the fact that all stories have a core of elements in common. Indeed, at a plot level, most stories are essentially the same. Excellent, thinks Lucas, that means I can legitimately rip off better films like the Hidden Fortress and the Dam Busters, better stories like Hamlet and Robin Hood and bastardise Buddhism and Confucianism into the bargain. No need for any original thought whatever, in fact.And thus it was to prove. From the ghostly mentor to the father bearing a terrible secret, Star Wars rehearses every conceivable cinematic (and indeed sub-literary) cliché. Along the way, it inflicts upon us some truly awful dialogue and a paper-thin plot.But these are not the biggest crimes of the film. The worst is that Lucas did not even copy effectively. He forgets, for example, that perfect characters are uninteresting. Mark Hamill may be a fine actor, but his goody-goody clean-cut character grates after just a few minutes of screen time. Harrison Ford fares rather better as Han Solo  so why does Lucas go back and make him fire second in the space bar? It's not just petty, it's puerile.Possibly I should relax, hang loose, go with the flow and not get so uptight. But I just can't help getting irritated. Star Wars is puerile nonsense of the worst kind. The best you can say of it is that it brings the McDonalds experience into the cinema. The worst it is a borderline insult to everyone's intelligence."
MarSco,"May 19, 2005",10/10,"What else can there be said about this galactic masterpiece which has not already been said? Now in times where the saga is (hopefully) complete, ""Star Wars"" still stands out as one of the most important movies of the film history.Even though some dialogs may be silly (but memorable nevertheless) and in spite of several logical mistakes, George Lucas' Science-Fiction-film can easily be considered as one of the most entertaining works ever. The spectator is introduced in a universe full of fantastic concepts and locations and meets there some archetypal characters, such as the beautiful and innocent princess, the keen, naive hero, the dark, evil villain, the wise, old man, etc. The mixture of fairy tale and western elements is extremely fascinating and seems almost perfect. Lucas' direction is so skillful that even the above mentioned drawbacks eventually appear as positive characteristics of this space odyssey.No matter its meantime rather bad reputation, ""Star Wars"" is and will always remain one of the most magical cinematic experiences you can make. It is one of those movies you would like to talk about hours and hours, but which after all cannot be taken into words.Rating: 96MarSco"
kapetanios,"Dec 29, 2015",8/10,"Star Wars (1977) is an interesting fantasy space movie,but the lack of action scenes and the slow pacing makes it boring(at least for me) a few times throughout the movie.Do not get me wrong,i like the movie and it's the one that started the saga. Maybe i am a bit unfair because it came out in 1977 and then it was something completely new, but that's the way i feel. There are some interesting and funny characters,the plot is pretty good,but the pacing is extremely slow for me. The actors are very good and convincing and the direction is good for its time(i guess). In my opinion, it is the weakest of the original trilogy, but still one of the best movies of its era."
jmmustchin,"Nov 26, 2018",10/10,"I've only seen the first half of Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (or Star Wars as it was originally called, which my Mum still calls it), as the second half wasn't on YouTube at the time (drat!). But what I saw was more than enough to thrill and entertain me! It's a fun-to-watch sci-fi/fantasy movie. The special effects are incredible. In short, I was thoroughly enthralled!However, I do have one bone to pick with the movie: the New Age themes. Particularly when Obi-Wan Kenobi uses mind control (which I staunchly oppose - it's unjustifiable). Still, it's overall a fun and enjoyable science fiction adventure."
PennyLANE77,"Aug 5, 2003",10/10,"I don't think I can praise or salute this film any more or any higher than the countless fans who have visited this site and commented on this film before me.

Michael_Elliott,"Dec 18, 2015",N/A,"Star Wars (1977)**** (out of 4)Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) joins forces with Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) as they plan to go after Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) who is being held hostage by Darth Vadar.Whether people like it or not, STAR WARS is one of those ground-breaking movies that became a massive hit and it eventually took over the world. Watching the film so many years later it really is amazing what George Lucas was able to do with this film and what would follow. I will gladly admit that I'm not a fanboy of this series and in fact this recent viewing was the first time I had seen this since it was released in its Special Edition form. With that said, even though I'm not a ""fanboy"" it's impossible to deny that power that this film contains.Storywise there's really nothing overly ground-breaking here but in my opinion that's what makes the film so darn good. There's no long-winded or drawn-out story to drag things down. The basic premise is rather simple as an up-and-coming fighter gets his opportunity to be great and sets out to do so. I think this simple story makes the characters stand out all the better because it really gives them a chance to shine and come to life. It certainly also helps that Lucas was clearly a fan of those cliffhangers from previous decades because he knows how to build up scenes and milk them for everything they're worth.It's really hard to say anything fresh or new about this film but watching this first one it's easy to see why people like Hamill and Fisher became iconic in these parts. Both are quite good in the film as are Alec Guinness and Peter Cushing, the two veterans of the picture. With that said, I think it goes without saying that it's Harrison Ford who really stands out in the role of Han Solo. His comic timing with Chewbacca has made for some of the most memorable moments of this film and he's simply delightful to watch in the role.Of course, fans will debate the tinkering that Lucas has done with the picture but I think both versions hold up extremely well. I understand the purist who want to view what they originally saw in theaters and I understand those who defend the updating of the effects. Either way, STAR WARS is a rare blockbuster that also manages to be extremely well-made and deserving of its reputation."
SquigglyCrunch,"Jan 2, 2016",7/10,"I was raised on all six Star Wars movies, and due to the recent release of Star Wars VII I felt the need to re-watch the series. My opinion of this movie has remained generally unchanged.The plot of A New Hope is, although not particularly original by today's standards, still a good one. The galaxy is ruled by an evil empire and a rebellion forms. I actually never knew why the rebels fought the empire when I watched it as a kid, nor did I know what a rebel was. So the plot didn't feel old or boring to me.The characters were decent, but once again, not horribly original by today's standards. I still found that they were just as likable as I remember them.Star Wars as a series is one that, although did great when it first came out, doesn't stand up to that nearly as well by today's standards. Reason being this series set the standards, so we've seen so much of Star Wars already in modern science fiction movies. The series does not age well, but when you think about it from the perspective of when it first came out it really is quite a good series.Overall A New Hope is a solid addition to the science fiction genre, and one of it's most important contributions. Despite not aging very well, it manages to hold up as a classic that I will never forget, and I think it will hold a special place in every person's heart who watched it when it first came out (or as children like me). In the end I would recommend that everyone give Star Wars a watch. Whether you like it or not is not important, but you just need to see it if you haven't already."
BigHands,"Dec 29, 1998",10/10,"Some claim that Star Wars is nothing more than a simple morality tale that borrowed from classic mythology with good special effects.  Comments have been made about the film that it has a simple story and that the movie has simple characters.  While all of these claims may have some validity, to say that the film has no depth is unfair.  When one studies how much thought really was put in Lucas' trilogy, they should be amazed. While the film borrows from mythology, Lucas has made sure that each film has a major twist from its ancestors.  In the first film for example, Luke goes to rescue a princess, but instead she is the one that ends up saving him. Not only does the story telling have a twist on classic mythology, it has an underlying theme and many sub-themes that no other movie can match. After studying the trilogy, redemption is the theme most often explored. Every major ""good"" character in the trilogy at one time falls and then redeems himself. The ultimate redemption being Darth Vader who will be the main character in the new trilogy being developed as I type. As for the characters being simple, this seems unfair.  They are archtypes.  Characters common throughout all cultures.  Also, all the major characters have motivation for their actions unlike most good guy/bad guy movies.  The bad guys in the films are bad because of human flaws such as the struggle for power and greed.  They are not simple bad for bad's sake. Even the main villain of the trilogy becomes very human by the end of the trilogy when he redeems himself.  The film doesn't show the bad guys only as something to shoot at, but as human beings that have been lead astray.  The two trilogies are ultimately about how a human being can become a monster, and that a monster is still a human being in the end. The Star Wars trilogy has more depth than at first glance.  Though it does have spectacular effects, this is only to pull the viewer into the great story-telling."
thechair,"Dec 22, 2023",7/10,"Obviously this was a straight 10/10 all my life, however, I just saw the adulterated version at the Duke of York cinema in Brighton and, if George and Disney insist this is the version I must watch, then it has to be reduced to a 6/10. Return of the Jedi suffers worst from the horrendous tampering but everything in Mos Eisley is practically ruined, and these scenes were simply perfect. A frame is there for the original reason: two people explaining or doing something, yet we now have dated, crappy monsters yawning and moaning in the side of said frame, ruining scenes that could not be bettered in the history of film. The final edit of the Death Star run also ruins what was perfect, even if there are some cool shots.I read a great article about the updated effects, to the point that they have immediately dated and made this version look sh£t. It's so interesting as old effects filmed at the time just do not have this effect: they still look good or forgivable as they fit in with the overall aesthetic. The new additions do not. They stick out like sore wampa thumbs. Rubbish.Anyway, that's enough. I am downgrading all three Star Wars films to 6s, Return to a 4 because the vandalism is that much worse, until such time as Disney atone for George's sins are release the upgraded original versions."
cwg2000,"Mar 15, 2019",3/10,"I grew up a massive fan of Star Wars. I've seen every movie dozens of times and I will forever be a fan.....of the memories.Unfortunately, the original triology has aged like milk. This movie, along with the other two, will always be a cherished memory for me, but I can't in good conscience bring myself to still consider this a good film. The dialogue, graphics (yes, I know), and narrative just don't stand the test of time.As much as it pains me to say it, the original trilogy is outdated."
Boba_Fett1138,"Apr 30, 2005",10/10,"Next to ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" this is the most influential science-fiction movie of all time.Yet the movie is way more than just simple science-fiction. It's adventurous, epic, fantasy sparkling. The characters and settings are amazing and are truly something that should speak to your imagination. When you just think about it makes you realize how brilliant and ingenious the story and the movie actually is. Sure, it's obvious that George Lucas was obviously inspired by ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Kakushi toride no san akunin"" but Lucas knows to put in such great and original moments and characters that the movie still deserves much credit for its originality. Basically Lucas came up with an entire non-exciting universe complete with planets, races, technology and politics.""Star Wars"" is one of those rare movies in which everything works; The story, the characters, the pace, everything makes sense and work well together and are what make ""Star Wars"" a rare movie that in a way changed the way we look at movies.The movie is well casted. Casting Harrison Ford as Han Solo is probably the best choice of the entire movie. He's perfect as arrogant space pirate and extremely believable in his role. Casting old school actors Alec Guiness and Peter Cushing was also a great move. Alec Guiness is perfect as the old mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi and Peter Cushing is brilliant as Grand Moff Tarkin, next to the emperor the only person who dares to speak up to the biggest villain of the galaxy Darth Vader. In a way he is an even bigger bad guy than Vader in this movie. But still there is no denying that Darth Vader is really the ultimate bad guy. Never has there been a movie with a better bad guy. Vader's character introduction alone is what him a classic character already. And then there is his suit, it makes him mysterious and ultimately evil looking. How can there ever be a bigger bad guy than him?What make the movie work more than anything is the brilliant music by John Williams. He knows to come up with some amazing and some of the most recognizable theme's in movie history. His musical score is what makes most of the scene's work and is truly a tool that helps to tell the story. Like in all Star Wars music, his music is present throughout the entire movie, one of the reasons why Star Wars is also sometime's regarded as a space opera.The special effects are truly amazing, even these days. The final space battle with the death star is really one of the greatest special effects achievements and really edge of your seat stuff.The people that worked behind the camera are the one's who deserve the most credit for the cinematic classic that ""Star Wars"" has become. People that worked on the special effects like the ILM guys and persons such as John Dykstra, Dennis Muren, Joe Johnston and John Knoll, paint artist Ralph McQuarrie, production designer John Barry, make-up artist Rick Baker, composer John Williams and of course director and writer and person ultimately responsible for the huge success of it all; George Lucas.I seriously really could go on and on for ever about the brilliance of this movie but I'm afraid that I'll probably bore a lot of people with that. The brilliance of everything about this movie is simply something you've to experience for yourself and luckily a lot of people already have. ""Star Wars"" is really one of those you movies you simply have to see at least once in your life.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
griffolyon12,"Oct 13, 2007",10/10,"Star Wars, now known as Episode IV: A New Hope, is the perfect showcase of everything that makes a movie great. It is one of those occasions where everything in the film seems to of perfectly fell in place(although if you know the story behind the making of it, it wasn't so smooth). The acting, directing, writing, production design, special effects, and anything else I've forgotten, is simply top-notch. This movie did so many things for film, most notably the special effects, but it also gave us three of the greatest young actors of the late 70s and 80s, Mark Hammill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Then the film also created the blockbuster, and is the definition of what a blockbuster should be(humor, emotion, action, heart). On the last point the action is probably the most exhilarating and exciting action I've ever seen on film, the Death Star Trench Run is the definite highlight of the film. This film is just simply superb and is picture perfect, and is definitely one of the greatest and most memorable films of all-time. It's hard to believe that this all sprung from one man's imagination, George Lucas(writer/director of the film). STAR WARS!!!!!!!!!Rating: A picture perfect 10 out of 10!!!!!!!"
AppleBlossom,"Mar 25, 2005",10/10,"George Lucus stunned audiences with this outer space saga when it was released and deservingly so. It was a film quite like nothing anyone had seen before a truly visual and cinematic achievement. The story begins on Chapter IV and takes us on an action packed journey filled with aliens, intrigue and adventure. The success of Star Wars is ultimately due to the wonderful imagination of its director and of course to the extremely well orchestrated cast. I think George Lucas was riding high with his previous film success 'American Graffiti, but this is far removed from Star Wars, no similarities at all. I was simply captivated the first time I saw this film in the cinema's back in '77 and still amalthough the big screen does give it more of an impact. Everything about Star Wars will definitely appeal to a vast audience from children to adults alike.it's a 'must see film' in my opinion. Then when you're finished watching Star Wars, just think; you have only 5 more chapters to go. 10/10"
zurnd,"May 3, 2013",10/10,"May the fourth be with you everybody! Today, on Star Wars day, I figure it only fitting to review the film that started the whole starry craze, Akira Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress! Nah, just kidding, it's Star Wars Episode 4: A New Hope of course. It has been said countless times that Star Wars was based upon the Kurosawa samurai films as well as the Flash Gordon serials of the 1930s and 40s, but in my eyes, it's an all around fairy tale in space. Think about it, you've got the dashing, optimistic hero in Luke Skywalker, the wise, old mentor and hermit in Obi-Wan Kenobi, the damsel in distress mistress in Princess Leia, and the terrifying wizard with black attire in Darth Vader. It's like a Brothers Grimm tale or a tale written by L. Frank Baum, who you all know as the mind behind The Wizard of Oz. But what makes Star Wars great is something I can't sum up in one single review, but I'll certainly give it a try for your sake. This is 1977's Star Wars, the film that changed cinema forever.I can relate to this film on so many levels. I see a lot of myself in the characters of Luke Skywalker, C-3P0 and even the cocky Han Solo, a rebellious lad with a devil may care point of view. I can also look up to Obi-Wan Kenobi, who has become a lot like his master Qui-Gon Jinn by this episode. He has gone from a brash, outspoken padawan who viewed many creatures as useless to a wise old man who saw the potential in all creatures. I love Obi-Wan's wisdom and it's wisdom I live by every minute of everyday of my life. My favorite line of his is ""Who's the more foolish, the fool or the fool who follows him?"" He has such a rich perspective of everything and his knowledge of the Force can give you the push you need to go about even the deadliest of tasks. It's his guidance that finally allows Luke to demolish the Death Star at the film's finale and it's probably something that will carry onto mentor Luke in the upcoming Star Wars Episode 7. Obi-Wan is the kind mentor we all wish we could get knowledge from so we could become wiser souls.Darth Vader is a menacing entity and is up there with the Wicked Witch of the West as one of film's greatest foes. The emotionless mask and deep dark voice of James Earl Jones really makes him ever more terrifying than he already is, but if you saw what he once was in Episodes 1,2 and 3, you tend to fear him less and less. It's hard to believe that underneath that breathing helmet is the charred face of Hayden Christensen, a once proud hero with a charming charisma. Little did we know that it would take him two more films until he finally reached his redemption and even than, it was before his untimely demise. Darth Vader is a motion picture icon, not only because of his wickedness and evilness, but because of his tragic past and his fight to gain back what he lost all those years ago. That's what makes an incredible villain, a villain that never wanted to be bad, but was thrust into badness because of one fatal decision.The other characters are also worthy of mention. Mark Hamill prevails as the adventurous, yet good hearted Luke Skywalker who would become the galaxy's most acclaimed hero towards the film's conclusion. Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia is a lot like Dorothy Gale or Alice in Lewis Carroll's classic Wonderland stories. Sure, she gets captured, but she's perfectly capable of defending herself and even defending her companions. She's a fearless woman who is not even afraid of kissing her long lost brother straight on the lips. Harrison Ford's Han Solo is probably the film's most memorable human character and with his headstrong and hipster attitude, he was what a lot of children wanted to be like when they first saw Star Wars back in 77. He's the ideal punk, but he's also the gallant hero and tough guy who's not scared to shoot down some green aliens (Who cares who shot first!) or stormtroopers.Personally, I became more fascinated with the non human characters like Chewbacca (Why didn't he get a medal!), R2-D2 and C-3P0, for like the humans, they were always trying to get the spotlight and give their share to the story. I feel like C-3PO is the most underrated character in all of Star Wars, for he is often seen as a symbol of homosexuality and annoyance. But Star Wars has a timeless story first and for most and this story gets better and better every time you experience it. Every time you experience it, you spot things you never spotted beforehand and that adds to the film's overall charm and magic. Even though it was made in the 70s, it still has the touch of a story that will last forever and never wear out. With all it's grand special effects (no matter what version of the film it is) and alien lifeforms, Star Wars is a storybook with a grand scale and a powerful, prudent moral that all creatures have a force flowing through them, allowing them to reach out and achieve the impossible.I'm not quite sure but I think that's why we love it so much. That's the reason I love it at least."
overlord1987,"Apr 26, 2005",10/10,"I loved this movie. I have always loved this movie. I always will love this movie. It is simply amazing. The actors, Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher all did an excellent job. However my favorite character was Darth Vader. He is evil with being ugly or digusting. The high level of quality from a film made in 1977 is astounding. Still being from the seventies, this film has some pretty interesting hair. But it is THE film that defined how science fiction movies are supposed to be. I did my term paper on the affects of Star Wars on the science fiction genre and the movie industry itself. Needless to say I didn't have to work that hard, the movies speaks for itself. If you haven't seen it, watch it. I love this film."
angela_clarke65-289-385219,"Feb 21, 2012",10/10,"I've seen this film so many times,in fact I grew up with the Prequel trilogy and still love this one.Actually the only prequel I liked was the Revenge of the Sith,although the Lightsaber duel between Qui-Gon Jinn,Obi Wan and Darth Maul is very entertaining but the thing I love about the originals is too hard to describe in one word,I love the story,the character,the sets are incredible,the acting is very good,and of course.......Darth Vader himself.This was when George Lucas wasn't a money grabbing idiot,when he actually wanted to make a good film,I just bought the Blu-Ray,I'm not exactly keen on the CGI filled changes Lucas put in there,but the picture quality and sound makes the experience even better.A Great movie that will NEVER get old. 10/10"
sethn172,"Feb 20, 2006",10/10,"All I can say is that ""Star Wars Episode IV: A New Hope"" is the best, in my opinion, of all six ""Star Wars"" films.I've seen this movie in just about every viewing method possible (both versions), and no matter how I view it, this movie is always the same. Combining the retroness of the 1970s with that of the future, ""Star Wars"" is in a different breed of sci-fi entertainment - nothing cheesy like the old 1950s monster or space drive-in movies, and nothing too arty and ordinary like the space movies of recent fare. Lucas and his team have done an excellent job with ""Star Wars."" Oh sure, the recent movies may not be up to par like the original ones do, but still, this is a movie series that will forever be stuck in every human's life.""Star Wars"" is one movie that should never be missed. If you've never seen ""Star Wars"" in your life, then you need a reality check!"
waqassaleem-85201,"Sep 12, 2020",7/10,Very fun and entertaining. The story and screenplay of he film keep you hooked. The direction by George Lucas is legendary. The performances of the cast are great. The visuals are great considering the film was released in 1977. Definitely a must watch.
k-khoshroo,"May 26, 2020",2/10,"Having seen ALOT of Star Wars references in my favorite shows (How I Met Your Mother, The Big Bang Theory, and Friends), I finally forced myself to sit through the trilogy. And oh boy It doesn't get any more overrated than this. What did I just watch?!!!!!! I didn't connect with any of the characters watching the trilogy. The movie was just non-stop action and visual effects without any dialogue or depth. The only character that didn't annoy me was Yoda who didn't have enough screen time... The trilogy might've been the best thing you saw in the 70s but it doesn't hold up to the test of time AT ALL. Let's stop fooling oursevles."
pavo6503,"Apr 8, 2005",10/10,"I was four years old when I saw this movie and I remembered the whole thing, from beginning to end. It was summer and my family was spending a month at our camp. One day my sister (2 years old at the time) and I had been fighting all day. My parents sent us off to bed for a nap before dinner and I grudgingly complied. I was awoken by my father, he was asking me if I wanted to go see a movie. ""It has spaceships, and robots, and lasers, you'll love it!"" I looked at him through swollen eyes and asked, ""does Jenna get to go to?"" When I heard him say no, I knew I was in for a HUGE treat. We arrived at a nearly empty theater, and took our seats. When the first jarring chord of the theme hit me, and my father began reading the opening story, I was captivated. It was the happiest day of my life. To hell with all your nitpicking. When something makes that great an impression on a four year old, you know it has to be something truly special. By the way, I'm wearing the Boba Fett t-shirt my son's mother gave me as a gift. And no, I'm not some greasy, Star Wars obsessed dork. Well, not any more..."

StevePulaski,"Mar 23, 2013",10/10,"George Lucas' Star Wars is a project unlike one I've seen before, as cliché and as empty as that statement might sound. It's a monumental achievement in the cinematic world, arguably the biggest one ever, that pioneered special effects work and accommodated for other science-fiction projects to follow in the next decades. When released in 1977, with sufficient hype and outstanding reviews, it was a movie-going experience; thousands of showings were sold out (something you never hear about anymore), universal audiences were captivated, cultists and enthusiasts were born, and the eye-popping technology was cherished and admired by many.Watching Star Wars today (now called Star Wars: Episode IV: A New Hope with the release of the three prequels), there is still a uniquely affecting vibe that it sends with its compelling visuals and wonderfully articulated characters. It's over thirty years old, but it effectively holds the torch that makes it timeless. No matter how far technology progresses, and even with the onset of computer-animation and a heavy reliance on digital cinema, the look and beauty of Star Wars will likely never die out.Since it appears that everyone has seen the Star Wars movies except for myself, I will spare you the boredom of hearing the plot reiterated for the umpteenth time. Besides, I'm not sure if I could explain it accurately. The film is fast-paced, dynamic, and just works so competently, that after a while, I began to dissolve any questions I had about the plot and just go along for the ride. Consistent readers know what I think of constant cinematic evaluations, and that I find them to often be without a reward and potentially lethal to the likability of a film. Things happen in Star Wars; crazy things, logical things, smart things, frightening things, but above all, enthralling things.Speaking of enthralling things, I must admit how often I felt tension build and suspense become prevalent during the course of this film. For one thing, it's blatantly obvious to people who haven't even seen the series that these characters will make it (hence the two sequels). Yet, during several sequences, I found myself tense and extremely worried for these characters (most notably the scene in the trash chute). When a film can make you fear when you know the outcome is when you know true filmmaking tactics are at hand.Something I have notice happen with older science-fiction films is that one of their downsides is their length due to their special effects showcase. Let me explain; Star Trek: The Motion Picture was a visual marvel when it first came out, but its story was extended out about twenty-five minutes longer than it needed to be because they were showcasing the technology, which was breathtaking at the time. It appears, too, that many fans even recall this fact with a bit of sourness, which is why when people refer to the ""original trilogy"" of the Star Trek films, they usually mean the second film through the fourth one. Star Wars doesn't bear that same quality; it doesn't need to turn the story into a methodical plod just to show off its creative design and visuals. It doesn't feel like a showcase. We get a perfect feel for the environment without having to stare at for an upwards of five minutes.One thing that disheartens me greatly about this series is how controversial it has become. With numerous releases on DVD, and a new one on Blu-Ray, to my knowledge, the only original cuts of the Star Wars films you can see are on the Laserdisc/VHS versions. Because of this, fans have found themselves lambasting decisions made by Lucas, criticizing all the changes he has made to the series on the new releases of the DVDs, his re-releases of the movies in theaters, and lucrative branding/licensing of the figures in the money that, in 2013, continue to flood the store aisles of a Wal-Mart and Toys-R-Us near you. I believe that's one of the contributing reasons to why I never saw or even felt like seeing the original films until now; I felt alienated and bullied, with the series seemingly shoving itself down my throat.On a final note, another impressive element is the charisma and talent of a young Mark Hamill, portraying no one else but Luke Skywalker. Hamill seems like the kind of guy who, after breaking out in Lucas' trilogy of films, would have gone on to do unprecedented projects, but alas, no. Hamill has only acted in either small roles or cameos in films, and hasn't really worked on any other mainstream picture aside from the Star Wars trilogy. While this fact is slightly depressing, as one can only imagine what he could've done, it's fortunate we weren't burdened of seeing him in anything atrocious.Star Wars is, in short, an incorruptible masterpiece on film. A film that launched the genre of science fiction, propelling films about outer space to unheard of heights. It's just incredibly unfortunate to see what dismal treatment it, and its fans, have had to endure since its release.Starring: Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, and Harrison Ford. Directed by: George Lucas."
nataliep325,"Sep 29, 2004",10/10,"This movie came out a few years before i was even born, but somehow one of my first memories was seeing this movie. Every kid I knew loved star wars boy and girl. So basically if i had to sum up my childhood in two words it would be star wars. From the cantina scene to the death star first rate special effects. The opening crawl probably still brings a tear to my eye. Han solo just rocked and Luke skywalker was just adorable. I love the scene in the garbage chute, but my all time favorite scene is when Luke goes outside and looks out to the horizon (the famous shot of the two suns) and the classic music cues up. Oh my god it gives me the chills. awesome!"
tullis-1,"May 30, 2005",10/10,"Aaah, Star Wars. The only movie that our ""old"" parents would venture to the theaters to see with the same enthusiasm as our much younger selves. Our young selves would be just in the next theater seeing the movie ourselves. Young and old, we loved it. Love it still. Make no mistake. Star Wars is the king. All other films will forever be forced to compare to it. Rightfully so.Imagine, a sci-fi film trumping all other films ever made. Quite a feat. Quite a feat it is. So it shows what a film with a heart can do. I have now seen all six of the Star Wars films. Don't bother judging them with a number. Leave that to the the others."
hall895,"May 25, 2005",10/10,"A classic story with a perfect cast, memorable score and dazzling special effects. Movies don't get any better than this. More space opera than true sci-fi, Star Wars takes you on a magical ride through a galaxy far, far away.The first moment of genius comes right at the very start with a written crawl which gives a basic plot outline and without which all that immediately followed would be hard to place in context. After John Williams' now legendary opening theme we are thrust into the first of many thrilling space battles to come. Almost immediately we are introduced to one of the great movie villains of all time, Darth Vader who is voiced with true menace by James Earl Jones, and it becomes clear that this film is not quite like anything we have seen before.Star Wars may seem to be your typical good versus evil swashbuckling adventure but there's a lot more going on here. The hero, Luke Skywalker, is your typical simple, clean-cut farm boy who will soon be thrust into the middle of a galactic war of as grand a scale as could be imagined. But he is not our only hero. Princess Leia, a leader of the rebellion against the evil Galactic Empire, is certainly not your typical helpless fairy-tale princess. She gives as good as she gets. Obi-Wan Kenobi is the older, wiser more seasoned hero and the mentor young Luke will desperately need. Han Solo is a space pirate in it only for the money, not for any revolution. Solo's first mate aboard his ship, the Milennium Falcon, is Chewbacca, a giant Wookiee who is remarkably adept at space flight for a creature which resembles a hairy two-legged dog. Also along for the ride to help our heroes are the droids C-3PO and R2-D2 who provide not only critical help for our heroes but some comic relief for the audience.The performances in Star Wars are all first-rate. Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker plays the young, naive Skywalker very well and Hamill grows right along with the character throughout the film. Carrie Fisher brings the appropriate smarts, skills, sophistication and determination to Princess Leia. Without Fisher's quality performance it might be hard to believe that this young woman could play such a pivotal role in a rebellion of this magnitude. Alec Guinness is reliably brilliant as old Jedi master Kenobi. He is mysterious, quiet and reserved yet very strong indeed. Stealing the show is Harrison Ford as Han Solo. It seems Ford gets all the best lines and he makes the most of them. Luke Skywalker may be the nominal hero of the film but it is Ford as Solo from which Star Wars gets most of its personality.George Lucas has crafted a true masterpiece here. The classic struggle of the underdog against the evil oppressor takes on many new twists here. The mysterious Force, the foreboding and menacing Darth Vader, alien creatures of all imaginable shapes and sizes, the epic nature of a battle which rages across an entire galaxy...in the end it all comes together to form something unique and truly wonderful. With action and adventure on a grand scale, fascinating characters on both sides of the fight, special effects that were revolutionary for the time and an ever-building sense of drama and excitement Star Wars is an absolute triumph."
jordyntsmith,"Dec 27, 2019",6/10,"Watched this with my wife (who has not seen it before). It is okay. I can certainly appreciate it in it's time, but this film in particular has not aged well - even when compared to episodes five and six (which are excellent!)Nevertheless, it is certainly still worth watching, and is probably the best film to start with."
rneil95,"Feb 5, 2012",10/10,"Since its release way back in 1977, George Lucas' epic masterpiece ""Star Wars"" has gone on to become quite possibly the most popular franchise in motion picture history, with one of the biggest fan followings imaginable. But no matter how much money this franchise makes, or how many people see it, no matter how many sequels or prequels or re-releases or remasters it endures, the original classic still remains to be a very personal film. Despite the success it has undergone since its release, the production of ""Star Wars"" was a highly troubled one, many people expecting it to not even get completed at all. The hard work and dedication that Lucas and his cast and crew went through to get this thing made definitely shows through, and that makes the movie all the more endearing to watch. Quite simply, it's an incredible achievement in movie-making.Now, these films have been discussed to death, but I feel like I'd like to give my own two cents on the subject, and my thoughts could easily be summed up in five words: ""Star Wars"" is absolutely amazing. Everything about it, from the acting, the effects, the story, the mythos, the music, the incredible intrigue that has keep this series alive for so long, it all started here, and it's great. I don't feel like I need to go too in-depth with a plot summary, because this is one of the most iconic films in history, but basically, ""Star Wars"" follows a simple farm boy living on a desert planet named Luke Skywalker, who yearns to fight with the Rebel Alliance against the evil Galactic Empire. Before he knows it, he's thrust into an intergalactic adventure, along with an inventive cast of characters, as he tries to help rescue a princess and destroy the Empire's newest weapon: a space station with the power to destroy planets, called the Death Star.As I said, this movie is awesome. The acting is fantastic all around, each one giving a perfect performance in these incredibly iconic, and unforgettable roles. The inventive special effects are some of the best of their time, and the action sequences are gripping and fantastic, never allowing a dull moment to come through. The story is incredibly fascinating, managing to blend science fiction through the space travel, droids, and aliens, with fantasy through the mystical Force, a defining trait of the Jedi Knights. The intrigue levels are really high here, and it's that intriguing quality that allows viewers to really get invested and really talk in depth about this movie.This film defined a generation. To this day, people still talk about it, and I doubt that it will ever stop being discussed. ""Star Wars"" is one of the best sci-fi fantasy epics ever made, and will always be a binding Force of cinema for the rest of time."

greaser-3,"Oct 11, 1999",5/10,"Why do people worship this movie?  It's not that great.  There's no plot, the acting is cheesy, and it's not that intelligent--it's brainless.  It barely can be considered science-fiction.  It's more the equivalent of a western taking place in outer space.  If you want true science-fiction, watch 2001.  There's a movie that will expand your mind.  Star Wars does exactly the opposite."
ancsika-1,"Jul 25, 2010",10/10,"I grew up behind the iron curtain in Hungary. We hardly had the chance to see Western movies. I was 8 when I saw it, in 1982. I remember we were late from the movie (I went with my brother and grandmother) and we arrived to our seats when R2D2 was trying to find a way out from the icy base of the rebells on Hoth.I started to watch the film in awe, as I have never seem anything like it in my life. It's difficult to describe what impacts it gave me. Yes, on first level the special vision complex of the movie, the freedom fight against dictatorship, the novel landscapes and then the modern technology, but also the Asian (Buddhist, New Age) philosophy, that I had never encounter until then.I couldn't get out of its spell for several years. (I think I was in love with Han Solo for several years, too.) And with the movie - even now.Thanks Gorge Lucas and the Hungarian Distributor, who dared to bring it it in!"
dataconflossmoor,"Dec 15, 2007",10/10,"This was the introductory fanaticism of laser works, as well as a bevy of special sound effects, and elaborate sci-fi costuming, which started a whole new revelation in the cinema world.

Marshtacular,"Aug 10, 2004",10/10,"Doesn't it drive you crazy that George Lucas is only releasing the special editions of the original Star Wars movies? I've been looking forward to these DVDs since DVDs began, and boy, hasn't George Lucas made us wait? Star Wars used to be the greatest movie ever made. Not good enough for George. He had to fancy it up with computer generated bits and pieces that, like plastic surgery on a beautiful woman, only served to fake it up. It used to be chunky and real. You felt like you could reach out and touch the spaceships. Like you could really smell the Wookie. But now it's just another Lucasfilm cartoon. At best, a trailer for the current unholy trilogy. I want my Star Wars back. My old reliable beloved Star Wars. Where is it George? Why isn't it on DVD? I'm hardly alone in my feelings here. Star Wars has a massive fan base but how come it's been so roundly ignored? Surely everyone wants the original versions. At the very least, the option to watch the original versions on the special edition disks. That would be great. Maybe Lucas is going to make us pay for the special editions and then, in a few years time, release the originals and shake us down some more. He knows we'll pay, and money does appear to be the only thing he cares about. When George was young he was like Luke Skywalker, then for a while he was Obi Wan but now he's forever Jabba, vile gangster and ravager of fans. Thanks. I had to get that off my chest. Please everyone, let me know how you feel about this. Should I just chill out or should we organise a march on the Skywalker Ranch? FREE STAR WARS NOW!"
aucoinandrew,"Jan 4, 2020",7/10,"I'll say what I enjoyed first:
The score- Wow, easily one of the greatest scores of all time. Makes the movie for me honestly. Scenes that would've been terrible without it were redeemed, it's completely original and John Williams killed it.
Alec Guiness and Harrison Ford- The two best characters in the movie acted by the two best actors in the film.
Special effects- It's fairly obvious as the movie goes on that it focuses heavily on its, at the time, crazy good special effects. The work and love that went into this movie are most evident in its countless sets and practical effects.
Now to the bad:
It's not original- It's simple really, Lucas even admits it, the plot follows the basic mono myth of the young farm boy taking on an empire. Nothing we haven't seen before except this time it's covered in gibberish names and space garbage.
The Acting, Dialogue, and Characters- It's so wooden. It's not the worst I've ever seen but the way people talk about this movie is as if it isn't bad. Mark Hammil and Carrie Fishers performance are so over exaggerated. All the side characters such as the imperial officers and Luke's uncle and aunt are just terrible. Their are some great quotes spattered around that are memorable and great but the in-between is just cringey and cliche. The great Alec Guiness would agree with me and he's a part of it. The characters are just card board cuts of classic personalities. Luke is a dislikable protagonist who whines and complains the whole movie and is somehow a master at everything he touches. Han I have no complaints with, he's great. Obi wan is cool and all but nothing we haven't seen before in an old wise mentor. C3po is so freakin annoying and such a useless character, he gets far to much screen time. Leah doesn't do anything except sit back and watch the other characters do all the work. This would be fine if they even tried to have any character development with her but no, she's pretty one dimensional.Overall it's an entertaining and enjoyable movie but definetly not deserving of any of the accolades and praise it continually gets. No way is it in the top 15 movies of all time, for me it barely scratches the top 250. Yes it broke boundaries for its time...in special effects. So have fun watching it call it a classic, but in no way whatsoever should this be considered a high quality, top 15 movie of all time...cause it's not."
MorfenZ,"Aug 23, 2025",10/10,"Watching Star Wars: A New Hope again reminds me why this movie became a legend. Considering it was made in 1977, the graphics and special effects are absolutely brilliant they still hold up and feel timeless. Harrison Ford as Han Solo is perfect, and honestly, every single actor nails their role. They bring this universe to life in a way that makes you believe it really exists.This is the first film of one of the greatest franchises in cinema history, and you can feel it the plot, the story, the world-building, the sci-fi elements everything comes together beautifully. It's exciting, emotional, and adventurous, and it's clear why this is where Star Wars began.If you're starting with the franchise, this is exactly why you do it. A classic that still feels fresh and incredible today."
Cantoris-2,"Dec 20, 1998",N/A,"It is misunderstanding to call Star Wars science fiction. Science fiction needs to develop, dwell on, and often to strike the audience with awe over a plausible scientific or technological development greatly surpassing what we know.  Lucas pondered early on with John Williams whether the character of the music should be electronic- mystical, as science fiction would suggest.  They decided against it-- and can anyone doubt that Williams's actual score captured the true texture of the film much better?  Set in ""a galaxy far, far away"" though it was, the music and almost everything else stressed the familiar rather than the strange. The parallels with our own culture were deliberate and a source of amusement. We are to feel at home in this world.  More on this later.I remember seeing this film for the first time, being in my mid twenties but catching upon in many ways on that adolescence which had passed me by in my teens.  I was with a wonderful, unorthodox friend, a little younger than I and different from anyone I had ever been friends with before.  He led me all the way down the aisle to sit in the very front row.  I had never done that.  Something so, well, extreme hadn't been my style.  I was, in short, prepared already for a different kind of experience, and Star Wars provided it.Part of the initial success of Star Wars was due, I think, to its simple and straightforward morality.  As others have detailed, everyone knows who the good guys and the bad guys are here.  The good guys are brave, confident of their cause, and they win decisively.  I'm not sure it has been remarked, however, how ready we were for something like this.  When it came out, the U.S.  was disillusioned and demoralized.First Vietnam.  Then Watergate.  Inflation was eating the economy alive.  We had become guilt-ridden and unsure of our instincts. We were tired of shadows, ambiguities, and catch-22s.  By seeing clear-cut heroism work in a galaxy far, far away, just maybe we could bring it back home where we were missing it badly.Also, at that time, I detested where I was living and working.  It had been a mistake to move there, and I seemed trapped and wondered if I would ever get out.  Are we in charge of our own lives, I wondered, or leaves tossed randomly in the wind? So I really empathized with young Luke's despondency, stuck on a dismal backwater of a planet when he wanted to be where some action was.  It was exhilarating to follow him as he was drawn into the vortex of important matters.  I daresay we we have all felt like that at times; so this is one more fantasy which Star Wars plays out for us.It is stunning to reflect on how well I remember first seeing this film, and how long ago it really was: some of its adult fans today weren't even born then.  But One can't even say that this shared admiration crosses generational boundaries. It simply obliterates them. How many films become blockbusters, and their delighted makers rush to cash in on the craze with one or more slipshod sequels which can be counted on to suck?  Lucas never did that. His craftsmanship and creativity have been consistent, and now his patience has got to be almost unique.  He has now been working on the fourth episode for almost two decades; and the world is still waiting for it with bated breath.  It had better be damned good.  And something tells me it will be."
djtet,"Mar 5, 2005",1/10,"A Macdonald's meal of a movie, all fat sugar salt and caffeine, supersized with whiz bang special effects. Tastes great while you're eating it, but short on nourishment. They did it well enough that this junk food has squeezed pretty much everything good off the menu. The pic is just mediocre, but the trends it started have been horrid. Cornball plotting and dialog is one thing, but the simple-minded good vs. evil masquerading as some sort of authentic spirituality is vomit inducing. The sequel, with its Freudian undertones, has some real conflict and character development and is actually a pretty good popcorn movie. But the original may be the most over-rated movie of all time."
Padrion,"Dec 26, 2023",9/10,"Recent ripoffs like Rebel Moon once again reminded me why the original Star Wars is so damn good.It's not the special effects, which were of course mind blowing in the 70s but look very dated by now, it's the storytelling and the world building. It's the little things e.g. When Luke is playing with a space ship model or just wistfully watches the double sunset that do so much for characterization with so little effort. It's the masterfully crafted sets, be it the dusty streets of Mos Eisley or the cold corridors of the Death Star, that reveal so much more about the world than the movie is telling us vocally. It's the love and dedication that went into every aspect of this production and is sorely lacking in many modern movies.Yes, Star Wars has so far stood the test of time and still has a lot to teach to present day filmmakers."
SleeveApplicatorManufacturer,"Sep 4, 2022",9/10,"I couldn't have asked for anything more. Star Wars: A New Hope had it all. If I had to sum it up in one word, superlative would be my answer. I saw the film for the first time three months ago and loved it, and since then I have watched all the Star Wars movies. I was disappointed with the prequels (Attack of the Clones was my least favourite), but this, Return of the Jedi and Empire Strikes Back were perfection.I have to say that the film looks absolutely amazing even after thirty plus years, with highly imaginative sets and dazzling special effects. And the action sequences were superbly choreographed and brisk, the Death Star climax was a knockout. The music by John Williams is absolutely outstanding, by far one of his more exciting and rousing scores. The story is fast-paced, intelligent and has an essence of sophistication, and the screenplay is sharp and decisive.And the performances were flawless. In the prequels I had problems relating to some of the performers, namely Hayden Christensen as Anakin. Here, all the actors played their parts with superlative skill. Alec Guiness, one fine actor and will be sorely missed was a standout, likewise with Peter Cushing and Harrison Ford(hilarious here)."
TheOldGuyFromHalloween3,"Mar 12, 2020",10/10,"Why do they speak English in a galaxy far away? Why is there gravity on ships in space? How do they travel far above the speed of light? And when the Death Star reaches Yavin why does it wait 20 minutes to destroy the Rebel base, giving the rebels time to attack and destroy the Death Star? Surely the Death Star could've just blown up the rebel base without waiting for it to come in range. Hell they could've blown up the red planet first if it was in the way. Even if they were overconfident and didn't believe the rebels posed a threat to them, the rebels could've all gotten into spaceships and fled the base since the Death Star gave them plenty of time to get away"
Movie_Freak1990,"Aug 21, 2022",10/10,"Star Wars has become such a pop culture phenomenon in such a way that it has become so relevant in our society, and it all started with this film. George Lucas' masterful directing, the cinematography, the music, the acting, the practical effects that was used during this production, everything was done masterfully. Star Wars is undoubtedly one of the greatest films in cinema history. Even if you don't consider yourself a ""Movie Fanatic"", you have to at least recognize this film's impact and influence not only in movies, but in our society as a whole."
da cissy pimp,"Aug 20, 2001",N/A,"Star Wars is one of those films, I fear, which, while undoubtedly good, has been idolized to a ridiculous degree: to such an extent, in fact, that I believe there are actually sad losers out there who have turned Star Wars into some sort of religion or way-of-life (a bit like the Trekkies with Star Trek).  While I must admit that I enjoy the film and its sequels myself, they're not THAT good, and some of their scenes and special effects (especially in the first) are looking embarrassingly dated by now eg the computers in the Death Star, and virtually everything in the climactic final scenes over that feared Imperial construction.Anyway!  As the above summary may suggest, these are not my main beefs with Star Wars.  My main gripe with the Star Wars films (especially the first), and something that I feel does not get enough of a mention, is the appalling treatment meted out to the stormtroopers in them.  I must admit, I have something of a stormtrooper fixation.  Their uniforms are very cute (and what I wouldn't do to be able to slip into one myself), and I was actually led to believe that they were halfway decent at their jobs (they are, after all, in the frontline when it comes to enforcing the Empire's feared and evil rule).  So why, then, are their lives so cheap in Star Wars, and why do so many die such humiliating deaths eg falling off ledges or into pits, or being shot almost as an afterthought by show-offy arseholes like Han Solo. It's a disgrace!  Those guys deserved a lot better."
fredrikgunerius,"Nov 17, 2025",7/10,George Lucas' fable is like a child's imagination in many ways: there are endless ideas and connections that are not necessarily all that interesting. But Lucas' compelling visuals help create a highly atmospheric picture. Some brilliant segments of old-fashioned adventure cover up a sometimes pulpy and pretentious narrative.
pmtelefon,"Dec 2, 2020",10/10,"I've seen ""Star Wars: Episode IV-A New Hope"" in the theater three times. The first was when the original came out (North/South Theater, Hicksville, NY). (I waited outside on line for over two hours.) The second time was for the Special Edition (Fresh Meadows, NY). The third time was when it was re-released in 3D (Fresh Meadows, NY). It was great all three times. I've also seen it a bunch of times on video. ""Star Wars"" is a true classic. I still remember how the audience reacted back in 1977. There are times I still get that rush I got way back when. Writer/director Tom Laughlin, of ""Billy Jack"" fame may have been kind of nutty but he was right about one thing. He dropped out of the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences after ""Star Wars"" failed to win the Oscar for Best Picture. He knew that with ""Star Wars"" writer/director George Lucas had changed the way movies were going to be made in the future. Laughlin was right. ""Star Wars"" is a landmark piece of filmmaking."
jamesbond007167,"Jan 1, 2009",1/10,"Star Wars is no ""masterpiece of synthesis"" or ""triumph of American ingenuity;"" it is a fraudulent copy of several good works of literature. Lucas steals the ideas of Frank Herbert in his work entitled Dune and plagiarizes even more off of unknown novel I cannot recall as it is so obscure, he felt no need to give it credit. I have heard arguments which claim that The Lord of the Rings is just as childish, but those arguments ignore the fact that The Lord of the Rings is a blatant and outright statement, a parallel to the horrors of the First World War. Additionally, the acting is phenomenal, the characters have depth, and the story has meaning. The authors of such arguments clearly view the battle scenes as similar to Star Wars, only having appeal because of the special effects. But things such as the gigantic war elephants actually represent something, whereas nothing is representative of anything in Star Wars. These elephants represent tanks, the new and deadly weapon that were finally used more frequently in war. I can overlook the discrepancies, such as the fact that the first time the Death Star was used it took but a few seconds to fire, but when the are attacking Yavin, they must maneuver around the planet to reach the moon, as there are such discrepancies in most movies. However I cannot ignore the lack of depth each of the characters has: Luke is like Dakota Fanning in War of the Worlds--he is paid to whine, and whine, and scream, and whine. ""But Uncle Owen, I was going to go the Anchorhead Arcade, I don't want to work on the droids."" His character is painfully dull, and the actor, Mark Hamill, lacks any sort of talent. None of the characters are relatable, none of them have any complexity. They are all straightforward representations of archetypes, with no combinations of emotions--in fact, they seem like the have no emotions whatsoever. Everything is superficial--I enjoy Star Trek: The Motion Picture ten thousand times more than Star Wars, and The Motion Picture is one of the most painful movies I have ever watched. Watching Star Wars, I can picture each actor--if they may be so honored by such a title--with a script in front of their eyes. It seems they are only reading; a common acting saying goes, ""Show, don't tell,"" but I have never been told a more boring story. Besides the painful, shallow acting, the plot is poorly written. There are no twist or turns, no interesting facets or components which one does not expect to appear; everything is predictable, everything is as plain as can be. Star Wars is ""a masterpiece of synthesis:"" I don't think I have ever seen a movie so perfectly blend plagiarism, horrid acting, a lack of depth and emotion and complexities, and so many other despicable aspects. As for its ""ingenuity:"" well, if plagiarism and poor writing, acting, and characters constitute ingenuity, then this movie deserves a 10 out of 10--if not, Star Wars most definitely deserves nothing but scorn. Why so many have found this movie so enthralling I will never understand."
oyster-01176,"Jun 24, 2022",10/10,"As a sci-fi/fantasy-loving teenager, I was quick to catch the Star Wars 'bug' and in fact went to the cinema 14 times to watch this movie over and over again in the summer of 1977.As I later learned, the plotline is straight out of the Hollywood text-book (of old - much less so modern, Woke-lywood)
At the time, the SFX were just awe-inspiring but are probably the one area which Disney have been able to improve upon, with their extensive and considerable resources.Star Wars, and its two related episodes in the original trilogy, will live on in history as a remarkable movie moment."
MFC9,"Nov 21, 2021",10/10,"The original and the second best, ANH is still amazing in its ability to entertain. The effects still hold up and the breakneck pace is as good as anything from Marvel. The secret ingredient to this film is the once in a lifetime chemistry between the leads. Ford is the movie star, Hamill the heart and Fisher the sass. Together they bring humour, pathos and self awareness that is non-existent in the prequels. Light years ahead of its time 10/10."
MrMovieMonster,"Jul 25, 2025",10/10,"The Empire Strikes back is the highest rated and most loved Star Wars film, of the original trilogy, but I personally prefer A New Hope.The film runs a bit slow at the beginning, but quickly picks up the pace with more iconic and interesting scenes towards the middle and end of the film. However, the world building in the movie is insanely good, meaning that the somewhat ridiculous story is somehow believable, which is important for the start of a sci fi trilogy such as Star Wars. I feel that A New Hope functions as a complete story from beginning to end, leaving viewers satisfied, without even having to watch Empire. I'm a big Star Wars fan and would recommend watching all Star Wars movies (even the sequels), but this one was my favorite."
SAFIS-74,"Nov 3, 2025",10/10,"Star Wars: Episode IV deserves every bit of its legendary status. Even after all these years, it's still pure movie magic. The world-building, the characters, the music-everything just clicks. Luke's journey from a farm boy to a hero feels timeless, and the mix of adventure, humor, and heart never gets old. Darth Vader remains one of the coolest villains ever, and John Williams' score gives me chills every time. It's one of those rare films that changed cinema forever but still holds up as a fun, emotional ride. A true classic that earns that perfect 10/10."
djsmanzgeier,"Jan 2, 2023",9/10,This film is amazing I would go as far to say it's one of the best. Everything about it from the Oscar winning score. And the acting is amazing the standout is Alec Guinness who got an Oscar nomination for playing obi-wan kanobi. If you have not seen it stop what you are doing right now and go watch it. In this film you can see the influences from Stanley Kubrick's 2001 a space odyssey and the wizard of oz. And I also like how it doesn't set it at an exact place and time so it doesn't get outdated. And the visual effects still hold up. I should also put Im talking about the special edition not the original edition. A+
TxMike,"Oct 7, 2004",N/A,"My five children were all under the age of 10 when Star Wars came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, 'Star Wars' filled our imaginations like no other movie before it. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.The Star Wars movies also were responsible for jump-starting the career of Harrison Ford, and today he is probably better known for his next trilogy, as Indiana Jones. The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."

fordgriffith,"Feb 21, 2024",10/10,"I do not like to throw out 10 ratings very often, but considering this was the first film of a 9 film, 3 trilogy series that was incredibly successful means it had to have set the stage well for a great story.The early character development of some of the essential characters were important for how they were depicted in episodes 5 and 6. Despite being released in 1977, the CGI and animations were ahead of it's time and revolutionized how films used them.The personalities of some of those main characters helped impact how they were portrayed or written about in the future scripts. One of the most distinct personalities in all of film history is Han Solo, and without the early representation of him, he would not be so universally loved by all.The feel and nostalgia the movie brings also adds to how great the film is."
AvionPrince16,"Aug 25, 2021",7/10,I never saw Star wars and i started with this one. It was pretty good and have a good universe with some moral value (good and evil). I enjoyed it and i felt that movie inspired some harry potter books (not sure but maybe). I found the movie quite good. Its like and adventure movie an have his own identity. Some revelation in the movie too.
HotToastyRag,"Oct 14, 2020",2/10,"Don't throw anything at me, but I've never been able to sit awake through a single Star Wars movie. As a kid, I fell asleep through all the ""old"" ones. When the first of the ""new"" ones came out, my family went to see it in the movie theaters twice, and both times, I fell asleep during the chariot race scene.But since it's Alec Guinness week at Hot Toasty Rag, I've got to review one of the Star Wars movies. A New Hope is the closest I came to seeing one all the way through. While origin stories are always more interesting, I just wasn't grabbed by the George Lucas fantasy world. If all you've seen are the ""new"" ones (or God forbid the ""new new"" ones) you owe it to the franchise to see how it all began. Yes, you'll see feathered 1970s hairdos, special effects that haven't stood the test of time, and actors you only think of as ""old men"" when they were young and handsome. But you'll still see all your favorite characters, lightsabers, tan robes, plastic helmets, and beeping robots. Plus, you'll hear John Williams's music when he first wrote it, which will be the greatest treat of all."
bleakeye,"Aug 5, 2001",8/10,"""Star Wars"" is perhaps the most successful movie franchise of the 20th century.  From movie ticket sales alone, it has made George Lucas a very wealthy man.  Add the toys, games, t-shirts and other merchandise and it should establish Lucas as part of history.  A person has just got to start wondering how this movie ever become so incredibly profitable.  Although this movie is watchable and even innovative, I really cannot put ""Star Wars"" in the same categories as impressionable films like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Stagecoach"", ""Casablanca"", ""The Bridge On The River Kwai"" and even ""Pulp Fiction"".My reason for saying that pertains to one factor, director George Lucas. Although many would argue, I think that Lucas is not a good director.  He always seems to be lacking focus with Star Wars' story, in which was almost the case with ""American Graffiti"" (Thankfully, he didn't).  I'm very impressed with the innovative visual effects of ""Star Wars"" as I am with any film afterwards that ever utilized it justifiably in connection with the certain film's story (it's sequel, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is much better in many aspects).  Unfortunately, outside of it's visual delights, it just doesn't have anything that other films hadn't already shown (even if this was made for children).  From the whole ""boy leaves home"" beginning (Mickey Rooney has done it before with more feeling) to it's much appreciated ""bar room scene"" (straight out of many westerns and even some war themed films), there isn't anything we haven't seen before.  Although the whole galactic twist on which the movie is based is totally original, majority of the ideas are still pretty much re-hashed from greater films (Kurosawa's ""Hidden Fortress"", Errol Flynn/Michael Curtiz movies, etc.).To re-evaluate, the bad parts consists of lack of originality.  The idea's, topic's and situations' originality in which a film's greatness lies are sadly missing.  The good parts which are visual design in terms of special effects and costumes definitely proves it's place in being a great landmark picture.  I just don't recognize it as the one of the greats.  This reaction could be the result of years of watching movies again and again and unexpectedly realizing a certain film's depth and lasting capabilities.  A good, not great movie full of innovation yet lacking any depth that is only realized when seen again."
Ruskington,"Jun 1, 2020",8/10,"While sci-fi is not not my preferred film genre, I cannot deny the sheer majesty and magnitude of the first and best Star Wars movie. A visually stunning and highly creative piece of artwork with one of the all-time great scores by John Williams. Some of the characters are brilliantly devised (not least the droids) and the landscapes and spacecraft are generally incredible. I cannot even imagine how astounding this would have been to innocent eyes back in 1977.Having said that, I have never particularly enjoyed George Lucas' writing very much and find the usual banality and lazy plot structure is well in place here. Much of the dialogue is incredibly corny and the storyline itself is quite childish and predictable. The pathetic inability of the Stormtroopers to hit a SINGLE bloody target is infuriating and ridiculous. It makes the battle scenes almost completely pointless given how much divine intervention the main characters seem to be afforded. This type of lazy plot armouring has always been my main gripe with action films and Star Wars is as bad as any.In spite of this, it is hard to be too critical of such a groundbreaking piece of cinema. I certainly don't understand how it has developed such a monumentally huge reputation but I wouldn't begrudge anyone rating it as their favourite film."
harryfielder,"Mar 16, 2009",10/10,"1977STAR WARSDIRECTOR GEORGE LUCAS After finishing a couple of Doctor Who's Central Casting sent me to E.M.I. Studios to work on another space film for seven days. I did ask them if they had any other work because I was fed up with wearing space outfits and the like (Little did I know about STAR WARS). There must have been about fifty Supporting Artists gathered on the first day, some putting on white space type suits, some being fitted out in weird make up and costumes and the rest of us waited around to see what we were going to be.We had plenty of time to sit around chatting and playing the odd game of cards. When myself and a chap called Ronnie Conrad got a call to go to the wardrobe dept, They dressed us in black space type suits but without a face mask(Were they telling us we were ugly enough to look like aliens). When we were dressed we sat at the back of the set and waited to do our bit. I got talking to a giant of a man (Dave Prowse) from the West Country and he told me he was playing a character called ''Daft Ada''. I found out later that day he was playing ''DARTH VADER'' (It must have been Dave's strong Cornish accent that made it sound wrong). Ronnie and I did some odd bits during the week and then the 2nd A.D. called for us to do a bit of business with our old mate ''DARTH''. We were going to arrest Princess LEIA (Carrie Fisher) Carrie's parents were Eddie Fisher (singer) and Debbie Reynolds (singer/actress). Debbie starred in the film ''Singing In The Rain'' in 1952 and I, as a twelve year old, was in love with her... (It soon passed). Anyway lets get back to ''DAFT''.Darth, Ronnie and I walk along some corridors and then into the cell where The Princess was being held. Darth had all the lines to say while Ronnie and I stood there looking ugly. (Typecast) In between lighting the set Carrie was very chatty and asked what else we had done in films. (Has she got that much time to spare?) I also met Harrison Ford and was to work with him again over the next few years. Star Wars was the highest grossing money film that I ever worked on. Some say it took a Billion Dollars at the box office and video sales Twenty five years later I am held in deep respect for being one of ""DAFT ADA'S"" men, by my Grandchildren Thanks Mr Lucas"

DavidL-111,"Oct 9, 2025",10/10,"George Lucas's Star Wars (later subtitled Episode IV: A New Hope) is not just a film; it's a landmark moment in cinema history. First released back in 1977, this space opera redefined the possibilities of filmmaking and storytelling, blending mythic archetypes, groundbreaking visual effects, and unforgettable characters into a seamless, exhilarating adventure.From its iconic opening crawl to the triumphant destruction of the Death Star, Star Wars is a masterclass in narrative pacing and world-building. Luke Skywalker's journey from farm boy to hero taps into the universal monomyth, making his story both personal and mythic. The ensemble cast; including Harrison Ford's charismatic Han Solo, Carrie Fisher's fierce Princess Leia, and Alec Guinness's wise Obi-Wan Kenobi all bring emotional depth and charm to the sprawling galactic conflict.Technically, Star Wars was revolutionary. The special effects from Industrial Light & Magic raised the bar for what cinema could achieve, while John Williams's legendary score elevated every scene with emotional grandeur. Its blend of high-stakes action, philosophical undertones, and dry humor created a tonal balance rarely matched.But what truly sets Star Wars apart is its heart. It speaks to hope, friendship, and the fight against tyranny, themes that remain as relevant today as they were nearly 50 years ago. It's not just a sci-fi film; it's a cultural touchstone that continues to inspire generations."
EMB0,"Oct 28, 2024",7/10,"This movie is a great jumpstart to the series. The villians and plot make a great representation of how high the stakes are. The CGI is not perfect but you must put into perspective that this was nearly 50 years ago! There is a protagonist for every type of person, from quick witted smuggler to a brave and naive farm boy. The villians are so well written they make your skin crawl just at the mention of them. The action is entertaining and leaves you wanting more. Compares to the first movie of other series this one gives a large amount of story and ""lore"" and yet doesn't over do it. In my opinion this is a must watch movie and a work of art overall."

winner55,"Aug 3, 2006",1/10,"Paul to the Corinthians - 'when i was a child, i thought as a child and played as a child; but when i became a man, i put away my childish things.'i was living near new york city when this film was first released - i think this was a test release in the new york area; the original promo suggested a serious science-fiction story, along the lines of the cult-favorite 'dune'. it bombed. shortly afterward, on re-release Lucas got the promo he really wanted - part fairy-tale, part Jungian Ur-myth, part retro-serial - and the rest is history. but the history of what -this film marks the beginning of the end of serious film-making in America. fairy-tales are for children; the old serial films were fun, but badly made; and 'Jungian Ur-myths' constitute a debatable psycho-babble theory; thus what Lucas was really telling his audience, in both film and promo, was that we all needed to be children watching bad films written by Carl Jung - or at least Jungian literary theorist Joseph Campbell, who was actually hired as consultant on this film.humans, to maintain their self-respect, need to grapple with difficult moral issues, we need to mature, and to learn how to relate to other human beings in complex and sometimes difficult situations; and we need the freedom to think for ourselves in such matters, to risk our own happiness and to live with the consequences. no one is saying that children should not enjoy fairy-tales, and perhaps they really do need these for psychological development. but even eventually children need to 'grow-up' - to stop being children.'star wars' would not have been so damaging to this culture if it had presented itself as a children's film. but Lucas was quite explicitly targeting, as audience, burnt out hippies, participants of the failed 'cultural revolution' of the '60s; and in doing so, he began steering them toward the political decisions that would at last put our culture and its economy, and its future, into terrible jeopardy - voting for Reagan, selfishly demanding tax cuts, mockery of dissent and dissenters, and flocking into paganistic 'fundamentalist Christian' churches seeking 'spiritual awakening' and, as many now proclaim, apocalypse.well, obviously, just one movie isn't going to accomplish all that. what the success of star wars did was to distract adult attention from ethically mature films where moral choices could be examined in their complexity; to such an extent that Hollywood - never all that supportive of such films, anyway - simply stopped making such films for a time. the bottom came in 1985, when the 2 best films to use truly cinematic storytelling to wrestle with mature choices were from japan - Kurosawa's 'ran' and 'Godzilla 1985'. and you know the world's doomed when a big green lizard has to be the one to make you ask important questions about the ecology, and history, and whatever place in the larger universe our tiny species finds itself.i mention Godzilla not simply for rhetorical effect. like the old fairy-tales, Godzilla is best appreciated by the young and the young at heart; like the old serial films, the Godzilla films are filled with gaffs and silliness; like the typical Jungian Ur-myth or archetype, Godzilla calls to some deeper part of our psyche, which is why we are entertained by his appearance.but unlike star wars, the Godzilla films never insist that they are the only show around - or at least the only worth viewing. and unlike star wars, they never pretend to be better than they are, or that they're accomplishing some necessary cultural mission. and unlike star wars, they do not insist that we remain 'forever young', only that we respect our having once been young, and that we respect the youth of others. and unlike star wars, they are inherently democratic - not because they insist we all be individuals, but rather that they insist that we all are already individuals, and yet to survive, we must come together and learn to depend on one another - democracy only has value to a collective of individuals, a human society. rabid individualists are monsters - rather like Godzilla's most intractable foe, king ghidorah.well, that's the big argument. for those who prefer simple solutions - star wars is a crude, fascistic, socially-retarded scam that the ex-hippies foisted on what was once a great culture. whether it will ever achieve greatness again - or whether it shall have cinema when it does - remains open to question.'now we see as through a glass, darkly, but then face to face.'"

mt-26230,"Dec 31, 2020",10/10,"Star Wars (Star Wars: Episode IV- A New Hope) was my favorite film growing up as a kid in the early 2000s. It is the hero's journey told in the most profound way. George Lucas captured audiences around the world in his space fantasy epic that I can rewatch any day and continue to absolutely adore it. The only ""flaw"" I believe the film might have is that the portion on Tatooine is slow in certain cases and drags in moments until Han Solo shows up. But that ""flaw"" isn't an issue at all for me. This is a MASTERPIECE and will forever will be."
bjstephenson,"Mar 14, 2024",9/10,"Not being around when it was released, the first time I watched A New Hope was in the 2000s, after the prequels were released but this was my first Star Wars film.I was mesmerised and frankly couldn't believe it was made in 1977. The space scenes are breathtaking, and blew up the sci-fi genre and redefined it, building on the Star Trek TV series a decade earlier. Obviously, viewing it in nowadays, the duel between Vader and Obi-Wan is quite poor but this was the first one ever and does the job.I've watched the original 6 movies at least 20 times, and I get joy everytime I watch each of them (except possibly Ep2) but this one has a special place as the first. The Original. And it doesn't fail. Thank you George Lucas."

I saw the trailer and figured ""Sure why not?""  I went opening day.  I was awestruck.  George Lucas's Star Wars is what sparked my interest in movies and now it's more than just entertainment.  I don't normally cry in movies, not even the reaallly sad ones, but I did in Return of the Jedi.  Because Vader died? No.  Because the Ewok died? No.  It was because the magician had no more magic and I had seen the three greatest films of all time. But wait! There is hope.  May 21, 1999 the Force is with me again!

QuandaleDingleMan,"Aug 19, 2025",6/10,"There's no denying Star Wars (1977) is a landmark in cinema. The visuals, practical effects, set designs, and overall creativity are way ahead of their time. For a movie made in the late '70s, it's honestly jaw-dropping how good it still looks, and I understand why it had such a massive impact.That being said, I personally didn't connect with it as much as others clearly have. It feels dated to me, and while I can appreciate the effort and vision behind it, the pacing and style just didn't grab me. I wouldn't call it a bad film at all - far from it - but as someone coming to it much later, it just felt a bit ""mid.""I respect it for what it is, but it's not really my type of movie. Still, if you love sci-fi, fantasy, or want to see where one of the biggest franchises of all time began, it's definitely worth a watch."
richard-dutton,"Nov 15, 2020",10/10,Just watched the original trilogy and what great adventure movies they are.None of the grunge dystopia of sci-fi stuff like battlestar galactica but just superb storytelling and acting by the cast.I am now going to binge on the prequel and sequel.
bimpsonbimpson,"Jan 22, 2016",7/10,"Star Wars (later to be known as A New Hope) was released in 1977 after a particularly difficult production directed and written by George Lucas and staring Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Alec Guinness. It is the first film in the Star Wars trilogy (fourth if you count the prequels which we're not) which went on to be a huge unexpected success. To this day Star Wars and its successors are considered some of the greatest and most influential sci-fi films ever made, changing the way films were made and revolutionizing special effects.I think Star Wars is fully deserving of its mass amounts of praise because it really is an excellent film, right from the beginning I was impressed. The amazing and now iconic score by John Williams booming while brilliant models (which aren't even noticeable as so) soar across the screen, a small Rebel Alliance ship and a huge Imperial Star Destroyer offer as some great visual storytelling, showing us where each side stands in this massive conflict. The good guys are heavily outnumbered and you feel this immediately as the suspense of watching the Rebel soldiers fear for their lives as the ship is attacked and quickly overrun by hoards of Storm Troopers during an exciting and thrilling action sequence.While the action is superb throughout, it's not the only thing that the film has to offer. One reason these films are as timeless and memorable as they are is because of the brilliant characters that are all for the most part well acted, even if Mark Hamill does show that this is his first major role, often coming off as annoying and poorly performed (something he greatly improved upon in the sequels). The dialogue was well written and felt very natural with great humorous moments which are just a delight to watch. That being said I felt the interactions between characters was something greatly improved on in the sequels.I mentioned before that the special and practical effects were seamless and stunning and the same goes with the costumes, make up and sets. All felt stunningly real considering the fact it was mainly strange aliens and far away worlds. You become immersed immediately in this huge expansive world.A huge player in what makes this film so entertaining is how mysterious all of it is, you are introduced to more names and places you want to learn more about and when you do even more questions arise, some mentions you don't even get a resolution for until Return of the Jedi. It all added to the excitement and tension of the film which put a huge childish grin on my face.Overall Star Wars is a brilliant film, it's exciting, it's epic in scale yet manages to be so close to the characters and emotions that drive the film and make it so classic. The effects are to this day excellent and the score is simply amazing. If you have not seen this film yet (how?), I highly recommend it, something as universal as this will be enjoyed by pretty much anyone."

All of the sudo British accents and posh attitudes that some of the characters had that were quickly abandoned halfway through the movie. The worst being Carrie Fisher, it was hard to ignore and even harder to give it a pass. The movie had great timing. A few years after the Vietnam War ended and also at the tail end of the Hollywood New Wave that consisted of long artsy serious bleak films that focused on drama and character development. Suddenly here's this action-packed space adventure with robots, space ships, swords, chosen ones, ancient myths wise old men, bad guys in all black, good guys in all white, turn your brain off adventure. Looking back now it's an average movie with a lot of holes in the logic and filmmaking."
raphaklopper,"Sep 22, 2013",10/10,"Before the genius George Lucas was about to go help Spielberg make the majestic "" Raiders"", he decided to do something, something that many were surprised when it was announced and didn't take a lot of faith on, which after his release was an absolute success both at the box office and critical, and today the masterpiece of Lucas is a classic that will live forever in the history of cinema!""Star Wars"" (not Star Wars IV A New Hope, please), begins with the yellow title suddenly appearing on the screen with an amazing soundtrack from the master John Williams giving us a resume of the history we are about to watch. It all starts with a small spaceship full of rebel soldiers start being invaded by imperial troops led by the sinister and cruel lord Darth Vader (David Prowse). Suddenly the film transports us directly to another side of the galaxy where we have the story of the young Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), a simple machine repairman teenager who lives with his uncles. A day after his uncle buy two servant robots, R2 - D2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), which inadvertently bring Luke the chance to realize his dreams of becoming a rebel and fight against the tyrant of the empire, a mission that will take him to the ends of the galaxy and will bring new friends but at the same time extreme dangers.From the beginning, ""Star Wars"" revolutionized cinema forever, especially the genre of sci - fi that at the time was just ""Star Trek"" with great success. Lucas of course certain elements form ""Trek"", since the crew of a spaceship with name style and friendship among the crew, but everything else was a tremendous attack of originality. Unlike ""Star Trek"" Lucas took the story and the great adventure with a lighter and fantasy tone, not childish but humorous, fun and even a certain religious point when the Jedi Obi - Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness) appears in Luke's life with secrets of him and Luke's father past.And just like ""Star Trek"", Lucas gave his masterpiece unforgettable characters, of course: Luke, R2, C-3PO, Obi-Wan. But also the unforgettable Han Solo (Harrison Ford), the bounty hunter from space who ALWAYS shoots first and asks questions later, giving the film a great humorous touch and a lot of fun (never one character caused such influences as Han Solo did), and even Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) no royal woman before her in a film had never taken up arms showing she knew very well how to take care of herself. Not only the good guys who stand out perfectly in the story, but also the great and unforgettable antagonist ever put to film, Darth Vader, no villain was so cruel and yet so adored by fans.Characters and stories fitting perfectly, but the adventure to be full completed it needed the huge Galactic scenario, which is not lacking in this film. I think Lucas should have thanked Kubrick about ""2001"" because if it were not for this film, visual effects would never be the same. And thanks to that Lucas gave the film with beautiful scenery and a vast galaxies and an unforgettable and thrilling final battle.The classic that redefined cinema forever with a story well-crafted and told, full of suspense, humor and adventure thanks to its unforgettable characters and stunning visual effects , the legendary George Lucas gave the world a film with tremendous quality and early one of the best trilogies ever made.10/10"

Cyberman,"Sep 20, 1998",10/10,"I was shocked to see this movie was only rated #4 on the top 250.  Sure the other movies were good, but none are of the same cultural magnitude as Star Was (and associated movies).Star Was is more then just a good entertaining movie, it is a culturally defining element.  I think it is more important / impacting to the world culture today then any of the ""culturally significant"" books I read in school.  Star Wars is a movie they should show in school because it is a cultural norm that people need to understand in order to interact with those around them.It is more then a fad of a movie that will be really popular for a while and then fade away (like most contemporary and popular titles), this is a movie that will be around for generations to come.For many people it defines a lot of who they are, especially those who saw Star Wars as a young child.  It introduced them to new ways to dream and think.  Out of all the movies in the Top 10 of the Top 250, Star Wars is the only one I have plans to show to my children when they are old enough.  Star Wars plays a very important role in connecting generation together, and will for generations to come.And amazingly, I am by no means a really big Star Wars fan, nor a fanatic in any since of the word.

tfrizzell,"Jan 9, 2001",N/A,"""Star Wars"" is just amazing film-making that never does get old or seem dated.  It was released in 1977, but could pass for 1997 very easily. George Lucas combined all the great elements of cinematic technology and story-telling from the past to create this impressive ""outer-space western"". The film deals with a young man (Mark Hamill) who must rescue a beautiful princess (Carrie Fisher) from the evil clutches of Darth Vader (voiced by James Earl Jones).  Harrison Ford is also along for the ride and veteran British actor Alec Guiness (Oscar-nominated) gives the film a dimension of style and grace that makes the movie work on so many cinematic levels. Exceptional.  5 stars out of 5."

CubsandCulture,"Nov 23, 2019",7/10,"A New Hope has the distinction of being the first Star Wars film and I think a lot of people overrate the film as a result. It is a wonderful film, on the whole and the Star War franchise is a cornerstone of American culture. But ANH is not without its problems. The start of the story is needlessly convoluted and overextended by about 15 minutes. There simply is not a reason-for theme, character, plot or world-to separate R2D2 and C3PO only to have them reunited 10 minutes later. Indeed the film has about 20 minutes of fat that could have been tightened up on the page. This is hardly surprising as Lucas is a weaker writer. It is not enough to ruin the film or anything but the writing is not crisp.The film's budget also leaves several sequences that feel less epic and more quaint in context of the franchise. The battle of the death star is almost laughably small in comparison to what comes after. And upon re-watch this aspect makes the film feel quite dated. Lucas direction is fairly good for him but there is a flatness to the film's classical structure that leaves much to be desire. In a lot of ways this film is a good first draft of the Star Wars formula.The film's endearing cultural power comes from the acting and the moral simplicity of the universe. Guinness and Ford aside I don't think any of the actors are great actors but they are all so earnest and committed to this story that their performances are charming despite, by way of example, Luke being whiny. This a classic good vs evil, underdogs vs overdogs, republicans vs fascists story and as escapism one can't do much better than this film. There is a comfort to seeing the Death Star go boom that few escapist films capture at this intensity. But with all things the film suffers from time moving on and this sort of moral simplicity is no longer as elegant as it once was.Overall this is a milestone in American culture that showed great promise for what was to come but that on its own is not fully satisfying. Lucas is a much better producer and ideas guy than writer and director; that most other Star Wars film's are better than this one is good evidence of that.A few words about the special edition: on the whole the special edition is a cinematic abortion. Almost all of the additions are at best superfluous. Most actively ruin the scenes they are in. However, the Jabba the Hutt scene is a neutral addition and at least ties the OT together better than the original cut."
info-12388,"Sep 10, 2016",4/10,"The ""silver screen"" edition, which takes the film back to its pre-CG roots (and was indeed the first version I'd seen), is currently available (for the moment anyway) on YouTube. Wanting to see if it was as good as I remembered, I sat down one night and watched it.OK, yes, most successful franchise in movie history. Got it. Great soundtrack. No doubt about it. But strip away the layers upon layers of CG work, and what do you have left? Not a whole lot.The acting is almost as cardboard as the sets. The screenplay is a mash-up of things that even in their day were sci-fi-movie clichés. The models are clearly that: plastic and styro models. The puppetry and stop-action work is almost unbearably bad. The pre-CG post work looks almost laughably lame. Perhaps Lucas is right: this is not the version we want to remember, because it's just a cheezy 1980s movie. STAR WARS' advantage, at the time, was that it was so different from what else was being produced at the time. But now, with the perspective of all these decades? It ain't holding up well.It's still a great series of space operas, no discussion needed on the point. And God knows it's made a kazillion bucks.But is it *good*? Well, sorry, no."

witster18,"Feb 23, 2015",10/10,"One of my co-workers, who's about my same age(40ish), was talking about an argument he was having with his 17yr-old son. The argument was whether or not the new ""Marvel"" films were bigger and better, and whether or not the whole ""buzz' around them was bigger and better than the original Star Wars trilogy.I don't think the younger generation will ever fully understand the scale of the first trilogy. They MAY get a better understanding after JJ Abrams returns the trilogy to it's awesome roots.The first Star Wars film, known simply as Star Wars, was a land- breaking milestone of film-making, with a story, characters, and effects(not all effects are cgi people) that melded together into the greatest interplanetary adventure of all-time(at least until the sequel came out).Today's generation can pick between Spiderman, Ironman, Captain America, and the Guardians of the Galaxy to find the film that they love the most, but when I was a kid there was one film, or should I say one trilogy, that stood far, FAR above the rest.The number one argument that is made today by the younger generation is that the effects are outdated etc, but it was in fact Lucas' commitment(at least early on) to use models and make-up to create a world like no other. SOmething that CGI just can't capture. When I saw Guardians in the theater I thought it was amazing, but later I saw it on the 4K 60"" TV, and like many flicks, it kinda accentuated the small flaws of the cgi and the set-pieces, whereas I watch Star Wars and it actually shows how amazing the film was in that aspect.CGI isn't necessarily an improvement. It's films like Star Wars and Blade Runner, whose ""Gritty"" qualities actually add realism to an unreal world. The only problems I have with the first three Star Wars films are the ""digitally enhanced versions"" that Lucas added later. That's why I eagerly await the original untouched films' release on Blue-Ray.Scores usually drop a bit over time, and as it stands now, the weakest of the original trilogy is scored 8.4(Return of the Jedi), and that is higher than Avengers, Guardians, Cap 2, and Ironman, and FOR GOOD REASON.And the original Star Wars is a superior film in every way as well. No Hokey opening like ""Avengers"", no lack of storyline like Guardians, no under-menacing not required to act Villain like Cap 2, and while I can't nitpick anything about Ironman, overall it just doesn't stand- up against Star Wars, it's a beatdown.Simply put, it's EVERYTHING about it that makes it better. The acting, the story, the character development, the scale of the production, the start, the finish, the middle and every minute in- between.Part of the problem here is that the added material in the re- released versions really detracts from the original films flow. The stupid dancing crap in Jedi, the Walking Jabba in Star Wars, etc... it did nothing but hurt the original films. The only added footage that didn't detract from the original films was some of the added bells and whistles to ""Cloud City"" in Empire, and Biggs early appearance in empire, which was wasn't an 'enhancement', it was cut-footage from the original tapes, other than that, the added stuff only hurt the overall quality of the original films. He basically added stuff that was the kind of stuff that ruined the second trilogy, so the original untouched films are still the real gem here. And that's not what these kids are watching either, because the untouched versions are HARD TO FIND!DOn't even exist on DVD or blu-ray. One of the times I'm glad I still have my VHS. Uh-Oh, Gotta-go, Re-tro:)And WHile I love the new marvel films, they don't have what Star Wars and it's two sequels(i'm a purist) have.. that tangible something you CAN put your finger on - because it's REAL.. they built those ships, they designed and made those costumes and set-pieces. That kind of attention to detail, and scale just isn't in the Marvel films. Sure, it's cool to see Hulk crumbling down a building, but this galaxy really doesn't ""SEEM"" so far away in Star Wars. It has that 'realistic' edge to it. It's the reason that you couldn't make a legit remake of Ben- Hur, Ten Commandments, or other older ""epic"" films... it would literally cost Billions.Even some of my favorite Sci-Fi's of all-time like Blade Runner and 2001, while milestones in their own right(especially visually), just do not have the sheer entertainment value that Star Wars has.97/100Star Wars and Empire are 2 of the 42 out of the 3400 films that I have ranked 10/10, and they are two of the most deserving, if not THE most deserving."
Chrysanthepop,"Dec 18, 2011",N/A,"What can I say about George Lucas's 'Star Wars' that hasn't already been said? It's one of the most authentically shot films, whether we're talking about visual effects, cinematography, sound, music, art direction and of course Lucas's direction. Perhaps this was the movie that tagged Lucas as one of the all-time greatest directors. Revisiting this movie more than twenty years later brought back a lot of memories. Obviously it has a lot of nostalgic value.More than two decades after its release, Lucas attempts to make its prequels and the consequences are disastrous. With CGI dominating sci-fi films since the late 90s, the look of Lucas's later Starwar films (movies 1,2 and 3 made in the 90's and 2000's) could not match up to the early classics. They lacked the authentic look and atmosphere and suffered from poor editing. Most of all they were so boring (lacking in energy, lacklustre story, dreadful performances etc) that they failed to engage the viewer.Coming back to the movie at hand, it is easily sci-fi action adventure at its best. It's rich in dialogue. The level of energy and tension is excellently maintained. Even the quieter scenes have you engaged with beautiful visuals and what's also amazing is how simple they are, no complex or intricate designing but at the same time very detailed.The characters are a delight. The casting is solid. Harrison Ford is charming and funny as the laidback and slightly self-centered Han. Carrie Fisher redefines bring a princess in films. Before that, princesses were cast as damsels in distress. Mark Hamill captures Luke's innocence and essence very well. Peter Mayhew, James Earl Jones, and Alec Guiness are great. Aside from the human cast who portray the characters so well, who could forget C-3PO and R2-D2 (voiced brilliantly by Anthony Daniels and Kenny Baker)?I could keep going on and on but I'll leave it here to watch 'Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back'. So long..."
kdladage,"Jun 22, 2005",6/10,"STAR WARS is, without a doubt, one of the most *influincial* films of its time (and perhaps even _ever_). When it was released, people began standing in line for hours in order to watch this movie for the fifteenth time -- something that had never happened before. STAR WARS changed the way we think about movies; it changed the way we market movies; it changed the way we think about sci-fi and fantasy in film; it killed the second STAR TREK series in pre-production at the time; it was important.Let me say that again: STAR WARS was important. That fact cannot be stressed enough. STAR WARS launched George Lucas into history, and created an industry legacy: ILM, THX, and so on. Suddenly, the idea that special effects needed to be of superior quality, and that the technology of movie making was something that needed to move forward became evident.STAR WARS was a ""great"" film in the sense that it was so important. But as a film, taken away from its context historically, it is not such a ""great"" film. The acting in many cases is sub-par; the dialog is painful to listen to at times; and Luke Skywalker has got to be the whiniest kid that ever lived (asside from, perhaps, his father, as it turns out).Still, STAR WARS stands alone as a fun, entertaining ride through the stars with an adventure that some fans, these days, can practically quote line-for-line.George Lucas has made some slight modifications to the film over the years -- the most note-worthy being the Han Solo-Greedo match-up. Although I am not really happy with that particular change, these are George's films and he can do what he wants with them. This makes George Lucas and his films unique in the industry: George really does not care if his films are popular, or if anyone likes them at all. Geroge makes movies for George to enjoy. We are all just along for the ride."
paulbaloukas90,"Jul 24, 2025",10/10,"This is the first film that started the Star Wars franchise. George Lucas is a genius at writing A New Hope. Actors like Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Alec Guinness, David Prowse, James Earl Jones (voice), Peter Cushing, Anthony Daniels etc as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Obi Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi, Darth Vader, Grand Moff Tarkin, C3PO etc were absolutely amazing in it. Ben Burtt the sound designer is a genius at creating sounds like the Lightsabers, Blasters, Darth Vader's breathing etc. John Williams is a genius at composing the music score for the film. I love the plot where the Rebel Alliance, who aim to destroy the Empire's ultimate weapon, the Death Star. When the rebel leader Princess Leia is captured by the Empire, Luke Skywalker acquires stolen architectural plans for the Death Star and sets out to rescue her while learning the ways of a metaphysical power known as ""the Force"" from the Jedi Master Obi-Wan Kenobi."
caricatunssss,"Dec 6, 2018",7/10,"The film is good. Interesting characters, interesting plot, but for some reason people say is a masterpiece.
There is nothing perfect on this movie, is just a fun action film. The villain is boring and Obi Wan has no personality. The final spaceship battle is a joke. I can understand that this film has some weird looking effects, but the final spaceship battle looks horrible. Everything seems boring and we see more of the pilots on the spaceships than actual the spaceships. The battle of Obi Wan against Darth Vader is also pretty lame. There is no actual battle, we only see Obi Wan moving his lightsaber randomly.
But it also has some great scenes. Han Solo is a very fun character, and every single scene with him is incredibly memorable. C3PO and RD2D are also great, some of the funniest comedy reliefs in history.
Nothing much to say. Fun film, some fun action sequences, some fun characters, but not a masterpiece by any stretch of the imagination."
kal9000,"Sep 7, 1999",3/10,"The special effects don't look nearly as impressive, or hold up as well, as those in Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey.  The story is nothing more than a bad Western set in space.  The acting is suspect and the dialogue is hokey. Get over it, it's not that good a movie, especially not deserving of #3 in the IMDB rankings."
isoma,"Sep 2, 1998",9/10,"One of my favourite films that stands alone from the series and yet works so well in the futuristic concept.I like this because the world in which it is set is congruent and plausible, and the action elements are superbly done."
dudleyjason,"Mar 18, 2006",10/10,"Without a doubt Star Wars is, for me, the best film ever made. From the opening scene of the film to the closing credits, Lucas's epic space saga had me riveted as a 7 year old child and still does today as a 35 year old. Star Wars is storytelling at it's greatest. Brilliant characters and amazing settings. Good versus evil, right versus wrong. For it's day, the special effects were unbelievably spectacular and totally groundbreaking. I could watch this film over and over again and never get bored and I do. This is a film that everyone should see at least once. Without the following 2 sequels and the 3 prequels that form the entire series, Star Wars can easily stand alone head and shoulders above any other film, ever made. Added to the other 5 episodes, a legendary tale is created. The one, the only Star Wars. A#1, cream of the crop, best of the best. **********/**********"
Leia1977,"Jun 13, 2022",10/10,"The original, untouched 1977 version is hands down the best movie ever made. Sheer perfection, from beginning to end. This movie changed my life. Thank you George."
ronakkotian,"Nov 23, 2019",10/10,"Back in the 60s, it was mesmerizing to see Stanley Kubrick create an out of this world (literally!) film known as 2001: A Space Odyssey but what George Lucas made in 1977 started a huge trend in culture known as Star Wars.Star Wars: A New Hope follows Luke Skywalker as he teams up Han Solo, Chewbacca, Obi-Wan Kenobi, C-3PO and R2-D2 to destroy the Empire's most destructive station and save Princess Leia from the evil mastermind named Darth Vader.Just imagine watching a movie like this in the late 70s. It would have been nothing like anything else shown in the theatres before. The film had a reported budget of $11 million and the effects even today still hold up. It's astounding to see something so original and unique be made for it to become one of the biggest pop culture phenomenons. The film looks gorgeous. A lot of creatures shown and fight sequences look real making the realism stay throughout.The characters are really well written. Mark Hamill portrays Luke perfectly. His transformation from a whiny kid to a mature leader was great to see and this arc added so much depth to him. Carrie Fisher fit right in the role of Princess Leia. She's not the standard damsel in distress you would see normally because Lucas fleshed out her character completely accompanied with Fisher's mannerisms and dialogues. Then we have the almighty Harrison Ford playing one of the best characters to ever exist. Ford lives and breathes as Han Solo as he is so entertaining to watch and has great chemistry with Hamill and Fisher. We also have Alec Guinness who played Obi-Wan Kenobi perfectly. Finally we have one of the most iconic villains, Darth Vader. Lucas made Darth Vader also interesting to watch by showing off his power and leadership to audiences to really show how evil he may be.A New Hope has so many great scenes (the bar scene) and character interactions that keep the flow going without a second of boredom. The concluding battle is something so intense and fascinating to watch. You being to wonder how they created it in the 70s. It must have been spellbinding and hypnotic to see something as cool and fun as Star Wars at the time of its release. It's filled with many memorable characters, awesome VFX and action sequences that'll make you root for each and every one of the protagonists. This was the start of a legacy that kept millions of fans eager and excited to see the rest of the series."

SuperMegaTont,"Aug 21, 2025",10/10,"With the exception of Rogue One, Star Wars went downhill following the original trilogy. Many suggest Empire as the best film, but for me Star Wars is and always will be the best of them all.Everything about it is pretty much perfect and has become iconic. From the Williams score, the casting of future Hollywood legends Ford and Fisher alongside uberThesps Guinness and Cushing, the simplicity of the good versus evil story, The special effects, Jones' Darth Vader voiceover, princesses and wizards and even the associated merch - the sum total of which was an alchemy that made this one of the greatest films of all time.I might be knocking 50 these days but I still get goosepimples during the X-wing attack on the death star.Good job Lucas never got the rights to Flash Gordon in the end as otherwise it may not have happened. Such has been the impact - the world would literally be a different place.The force is strong with this one."
elshikh4,"Apr 3, 2010",7/10,"The important points about this movie are very..The first of the ones around it; is that overwhelming success. It was incredible to see how the audience declared ""war"" over the entire hippie, realistic, experimental American cinema, whatever the name of the problem was, which prevailed since the end of the 1960s. And they celebrated a real glossy and entertaining another one. Apparently, this movie returned the word commercial to movies, being Hollywood's perfect revenge out of TV, previous expensive ""not hit"" movies, or the else illnesses, and the birth of the modern blockbuster as we know right now.Additionally, I think that (Star Wars) gave the movies such a fundamental influence; which was pushing powerfully the teenagers as the cinematic heroes, and sci-fi to the commercial rank. Yes, Disney movies used the teenager heroes before, but on a short-range and not with a gigantic prosperity, and sci-fi was there, yet artistically. So (Star Wars) paved the way to venturesome leads, who range between 10 and 18 year old, in next sci-fi, or fantasy for that matter, hits. Recall: E.T., The Goonies, Back to the Future.. etc, which defined the ages of the moviegoers for years to come, and manifested that fantastic cinema could be popular and profitable.Then, the important points ""in"" it. For one is the combination of the script. It's smart to gather factors of the western legacy, the old world's legends and the sci-fi space adventures. And it clicked. I loved the most that team of: strong mystic knight (Obi-Wan Kenobi), reckless bounty hunter (Han Solo), willful Princess (Leia), heroic immature farmer (Luke Skywalker), English - so devoted - butler (C-3PO), and clever little robot (R2-D2); instead of the mythical animals of the ancient legends. And not to forget the metallic Commander, and magical evil guy (Darth Vader). That selecting of soul, mind, and heart vs. viciousness, coldness, and inhumanity was so creative despite how using them wasn't mostly as creative.And, these special effects. I believe that was a milestone at its time. The next stops will be (Terminator 2: Judgment Day - 1991) and (The Matrix - 1999).Let alone that music score. (John Williams) is the one who can make the symphonies so marketable. What I love about him is his understanding when it comes to expressing many themes so passionately. And the way how he gave that plain tale a profound shadows and enthusiastic spirit. He can turn any light cartoon into a Shakespearean epic, with load of credibility and likability. Without his music, this movie could have lost good deal of its personality and prestige.Away from all of those points, the script wasn't that competent, which is something to be assured of with the next, not written by (George Lucas), sequel. And to hold by your own hands with the next, wholly doomed, wholly written by Lucas, 3 prequels! In this movie, I don't remember a twist or surprise. The thrill wasn't that super. The characters were so comics; namely funny and naive. And I hated points like, for instance, how (Chewbacca) was so unnecessary, rather unused!I watched it more than once, and I can't deny the feel of bore in some places. For one reason, the dialogue is so-deeply-insightful-it's-uninteresting, seeming so geeky and no entertaining. It's things to be written but not to be said; exactly as (Carrie Fisher) referred to (Lucas) once. And for another, the direction was ordinary; many scenes were tepid and humdrum.The action sequences weren't the best. The long climactic sequence, of exploding the death star, was yes kind of new image, but surely artificial, monotonous, and lacking any high suspense. Although the lightsabers idea was impressive, but the swordplay wasn't. Generally, the movie relayed more on the cool look more than the smart directing.Unlike many of the movie's attackers, I didn't hate the acting. It was suitable and fresh. The thing is that script didn't endow these actors with many characteristics, or hard situations to make them enjoyably watchable and deeply effective. (Alec Guinness), (James Earl Jones) and (Harrison Ford) were the winners. (Ford) in particular stole the show. Aside from his wit, the lovable cowboy was absent for years. And simply his character was the more human; the type that will be nonexistent in the prequels. On the other hand, (Mark Hamill) and (Carrie Fisher) lacked charisma, and (Peter Cushing) was wasted to the degree of being unnoticed.The ""New Hope"" matter was a new nonsense! I don't know how (Lucas) did that in cold blood? But clearly he did it only for himself. Otherwise, it's a practical lesson in how to toy with an old movie to change and alter, how to irritate viewers by some useless CGI, and how to destroy the history since it makes you totally out of the mood and distracted between the original 1970s's quality and the 1990s's one!The sequel is way better. Mainly because (Lucas) was out of the writing and the directing. These previous defects, that I mentioned, would be doubled in the next trilogy of prequels; where the script would go down, the action would be so missed, the direction would be downright tedious, the CGI would hugely and provocatively rule as if it's the point, and the acting - sorrowfully - would hit the rock bottom also!Nostalgia got a big hand in the top rank which (Star War) achieved. No doubt, the viewers of the late 1970s were so thirsty for that substitute dazzlingly-made world, being extremely fed up of countless anti-heroes, needing desperately a portion of sheer noble adventures or good American values. Not the (""Dirty"" Harry), not the ""British"" (James Bond). So they got all the reasons to adore this movie. It looked different and desired for them, unlike someone who watched it in 1998. Because deep down inside, (Star Wars) is averagely entertaining time. And despite my admitting that it has great effects, it is not a great movie in my book."
movesukkaz,"Sep 5, 2004",1/10,"After wanting to see this for nearly 2 decades I finally got around to watching it...pathetic. First off, I actually did feel excited during the yellow bordered title sequence, I mean the theme music kicked in and I thought I was really in for a something special. My God was I wrong. This film is unwatchable.We have this tin can going around beeping every friggin two seconds. Easily the most annoying thing I've ever had to endure since seeing Julie Andrews (a grown woman btw) actually skipping while singing a song about confidence in the Sound Of Music. Then the dialogue sets in and let me tell you, I've never in my life heard anything so juvenile. Like I cant even revert my brain back far enough to an age where this dialogue would seem even remotely interesting, fantastic, or fun. The whole movie, script, costumes, story is just one tacky, immature mess that absolutely stunned me in its awfulness and I'm being completely serious. Turkey/5 Recommended for fans of Sesame Street, bandwagons, and all things overrated."
BomageMinimart,"Oct 2, 2004",10/10,"I just got the box set of the first 3 Star Wars movies, only to discover that it contains A New Hope, not Star Wars...for those who don't understand the distinction, Star Wars is the film that was released in 1977, capturing the hearts, minds, and dollars of movie-goers everywhere. A New Hope if the crap that Lucasfilm released in the late 90s that includes really poorly done CGI and new scenes, many of which contradict things that we've previously seen in the film (just why was that bounty hunter looking for Han Solo? for Jabba? Jabba finds Han in the very next scene... dumb dumb dumb).Star Wars was great, and if i could buy that I would watch it a thousand times. As it is, Lucasfilm ripped me off for another $43. I'd donate it to some orphanage or something, only i prefer to just throw trash away.Congratulations, Lucasfilm, on tricking me out of my money. It's the last you'll ever get. From here on out, I'm done with yer products, even the non-Star Wars ones. This paying customer says ""c ya"".BoOh, btw... The Phantom Edit is what Phantom Menace could have been, and even it can't overcome the bad story, bad cinematography, and atrocious acting."
view_and_review,"Jul 8, 2004",10/10,"One of my earliest cinematic memories was that of Luke Skywalker flying his fighter ship into the long canal in the Death Star and using the force to accurately fire two shots into its core to blow it up. Ever since I was 5 I've loved this movie and I have never tired of it's story and excellent special effects. This movie was well ahead of its time and was a true trend setter as is evident by how many movies after Star Wars have taken from it. It was masterfully written and directed with a great story to go with even more magnificent special effects. This movie was all inclusive for every movie goer: there was the science fiction part of it with glimpses of the future not too far from reality. There was the tale of good versus evil and even a sub-plot of religious versus irreligious with those who believed in the ""Force"" and those who didn't. And there was even a bit of chivalry with the rescue of the damsel in distress, Princess Leia. The characters were intriguing and all had their niche in the movie. Ultimately, how could you not like the movie that gave birth to Darth Vader, arguably the most notorious screen villain ever. This is just an epic saga which I can't say enough about."
coypoitier,"Dec 15, 2018",10/10,This movie is one of the reasons I became a fan of sci-fi films and why I aspired to be a sci-fi film producer! Amazing!! There's no other film I have watch more than this one.
mikebell-30542,"Sep 16, 2022",10/10,"This film, entertains from the get go, with its fast pace, action, humor and wit.The film keeps a fast, but steady pace through out, with visual effects and world building, that changed cinema for ever.When you watch this film, you are not only entertained but you are also, aware that you are watching film history.One of the best scores ever, by John Williams, who I think is the greatest film musician of all time, combined with an amazing performance, by Alec Guinness, who I believe, is one of the greatest, actors of all time.A treat of film, that simply does not age, made by a director, who at the time, had a completely unique vision."
lostonthehighway,"Jan 27, 2022",10/10,"There are over 1,022,000 words in the English language and that still isn't enough to describe the absolute brilliance of Star Wars.Unlike most people who have seen and loved Star Wars, I actually watched this film a little late - i.e. I wouldn't say it was a childhood film of mine, as it was for most people, rather, I watched it a few days ago at my current age. This was partially because I a) didn't think I'd like that kind of thing and b) because I found it to be so hyped and so talked about, it couldn't possibly be *that* good. Well, let me just say that I have never been happier to be so wrong in my life.By the way, I should probably note that what I'm saying in this review largely applies to all three films, because I love them all pretty much equally, but I'm going to write it under the original because, well, it's the original, and also (despite a very close competition), my favourite of the three.Every single facet of this film captivated me from start to finish. Not for a dingle moment did I feel its 2 hour runtime, I was always too busy staring at the set pieces... or trying not to laugh... or trying not to cry... or biting my nails in anticipation. Speaking of the set pieces, the fact that this was made all the way back in '77 is actually beyond me. The effects have held up mind-blowingly well almost fifty years later, and I honestly prefer this a thousandfold to the green screen trash we get nowadays. I can just see how much care and time was put into those beautiful practical effect spaceships and everything. I can definitely see some influences of 2001: A Space Odyssey in the effect work, and I mean that in every good way possible.Now, the plot. The story. Just. Wow. I mean - Star Wars has been referenced in popular media so much that I was pretty familiar with the series, as pretty much anyone is, even before I watched it. So I thought I had it all down. But the reality was that I was hit with such a massive... FLOOD of visual and narrative beauty that I didn't think that my tiny insignificant human mind could handle it all. And seeing all those aforementioned references finally click together and make sense...and the characters were all awesome in their own ways and the worldbuilding was incredible. It's just so original and beautiful, and the ending left me smiling from ear to ear. I didn't think that somehow you could have moments that were both hilarious and heartfelt, with drama and impeccable action scenes and beautiful FX in one movie, all while still being rated U.Writing this in 2022, I know that Star Wars has grown into a multi-million-dollar franchise, with spin-offs, prequels, sequels, side movies, books, and a hell of a fan base. I actually haven't seen anything apart from the original trilogy (at the time of writing), and one of the main reasons I want to keep it that way is that before Disney got its greedy little hands on it, these three films were basically THE science fiction films - the new, industry-changing, Big Thing that everyone was talking about. I'm a big fan of old 80's-90's science fiction (The Matrix, Blade Runner, 2001, the old Dune, etc), which is why I gravitated towards watching it in the first place. And I really do want to keep it as a perfect trilogy by not voyaging into the wider world of Star Wars. Who knows, maybe I will watch the other stuff one day, but my heart will always belong to the originals.Getting to see a film just so iconic at an age where I can genuinely appreciate its greatness was actually really nice. When the opening crawl started with its iconic yellow letters, the double sunset on Tatooine, the lightsaber fights, the Millennium Falcon, ""That's no moon"", the X-wings, C-3PO and R2-D2, Han and Leia, Luke using the Force, I could go on and on. You know it's going to be amazing when, within the first 10 minutes, you think to yourself, ""Damn, what a film"". And then continue to think that throughout the entire runtime.Honestly, I could talk about this film for hours, but in short, giving this anything less than 10 stars is a crime.-Sasha."
DougLorenz,"Sep 27, 2004",N/A,"I remember fondly the original Star Wars movies in the theatre when I was a child. They were an excellent combination of special effects and plot development which made them the great classics that they are.Then the prequel trilogy came out...The prequel movies abandoned plot cohesiveness in favor of creating more opportunities to showcase the computer generated effects which are produced by Lucas' firm, Industrial Light and Magic. Foolish plot holes were created and the overall tempo of the movies was compromised to achieve the goal of more and more special effects scenes.Most people have been able to simply offer a dismissive sigh, accepting that George Lucas really isn't a very talented screenwriter, and shouldn't be allowed anywhere near a script when it's being written. At least we still had the original trilogy, which rests in our memories as great cinema.That all changed with the release of the new DVD version of the original trilogy. Lucas jumped in with his clumsy editing and rewrote whole sections of these movies so that they could be more like the prequel trilogy. ""Modern"" CGI effects were inserted into the classic movies in a seemingly random manner, breaking the continuity of the originals into a sick parody of the memories that we all have of these classics.One of the sadder botched edits done to the first Star Wars movie (now called Star Wars IV: A New Hope) appears to have been done out of political correctness. I guess Lucas now believes that a good guy would never shoot first in a gunfight, so in the bar scene where Greedo confronts Han Solo it appears that Lucas had to make some changes. I remember as a kid watching the original movie at the theater in 1977, and cheered as Han Solo covertly drew his gun under the table and shot Greedo without warning. I was surprised to see this scene edited for the DVD release to show Greedo actually firing first, missing badly from about five feet away before being shot by Han Solo.Special effects added throughout the movie seemed to do little more than break the flow of the movie in the same manner in which they cripple the prequel trilogy. The worst examples of these edits actually occurred in the final movie, Return of the Jedi, so I won't comment about that here.I wonder whether this isn't some marketing game, where Lucas expects to make a bundle of money off the badly edited DVD, and then in about 3 years will repackage the whole thing again without the modifications to release a version of the first trilogy that we would all run out and buy. However, much like the whole ""New Coke"" conspiracy theory, I really don't believe that there is any plan involved in this badly edited product. This is just the final product of the inflated ego of George Lucas, a man who believes that his special effects can make anything better.If that is the case, then he is badly mistaken. His additional special effects have vandalized a cinema classic."
poseyfan,"Jun 12, 2022",10/10,"Whenever i watch the original trilogy i just feel so... At home. Maybe it's because i grew up with them and it's the nostalgia? But man these movies still hold up.

dbdumonteil,"Aug 8, 2001",6/10,"From ""Star Wars "" onwards,sci-fi became the most popular genre for a while.It as a return to simplicity,in spite of the huge special effects.Actually,the screenplay could have been written by a ten-year old,and the characters ,stereotyped and Manichean ,will not do any harm,will not raise intellectual dilemma.Princess Leia Organa is totally sexless and seems to come from some forgotten fairy tale.Luke is a pale shadow from a knight of the round tables without a Graal to conquer,and Han Solo is the masculine raider we've already seen in a lot of movies. Humor,like in Fredric's Brown tales?none,unless the two robots count. Mystery ,like in AC Clarke's 2001?none,unless Darth Vader 's hidden identity counts? The last quarter of the movie recalls a giant video game. After ""star wars""(and close encounters of the third kind) ,intellectual sci-fi was over the hill;now two kinds would share the market between them:the harmless sci-fi for toddlers and brats(Star War saga,ET,the black hole)and the horrific ,brainless and witless sci-fi (Alien and sequels)""2001"" became an ET movie and its overwhelming genius did not influence anymore,alas."
merisoch,"Jun 14, 2015",1/10,"This movie might've been interesting for a 20th century audience, but that's probably only because the technology and visual effects were all new and thrilling back then. To those from the 21st century, who've already been exposed to much more exciting (improved) technological effects several times, this movie will be a waste of time. To me, besides the fact that the graphics that have been enjoyed by perhaps billions in the past were nothing in comparison to the graphics of the average 2010s sci-fi movie, this movie was horrible because of the fact that it lacked a reasonably good plot. The plot was all over the place, at times difficult to follow but mostly just downright boring. Even if you must watch this film because you're a devoted Star Wars fan, you're probably not enjoy this film.Lesson learnt: a movie doesn't need to be good just because it's at the top of the IMDb 250 list.If you're interested in sci-fi, I'd recommend watching more recent films, like (1) Interstellar or (2) The Matrix, or even something animated like (3) WALL·E."
Asentiff2004,"Dec 22, 2013",9/10,"Set in a galaxy a long time ago and far far away, young farmhand Luke Skywalker take's his first steps in embracing his lineage and his destiny. In the midst of a intergalactic war with the rebellion that has spanned years and torn apart the galaxy, the evil galactic empire and its dreaded new weapon the Death Star have spread fear throughout the galaxy. Having been captured by one of the empires most sinister agents Darth Vader, Princess Leia sets off a chain reaction that will forever change and define the galaxy...The movie that ushered in a new era for blockbusters and ground breaking special effects that brought forth a new precedence in what can be achieved in film and storytelling. At one time the highest grossing film of all time. The story, sweeping, the characters and locations memorable and what many have dubbed the greatest sci fi movie of all time.Lucas takes you on a roller coaster ride of action and adventure that had as of yet to be every experienced in film. Once again John Williams scores this movie where in this instance the soundtrack only strengthens and endears the film for legions of fans across the world, having spawned 5 sequels and with an upcoming 6th film coming out in 2015, Star Wars is simply put one of the finest gems in all of film history."
markovd111,"Feb 4, 2024",10/10,"Here's the thing. Watching this movie nowadays and comparing it to current standards, you will find a movie which has an overly long beginning, a lot of illogical stuff in it's plot and you won't be able to help yourself not to think how silly and clunky it all looks. If you want to criticize this movie, you will find stuff to criticize, I assure you. And let's not even talk about that whole special editions drama.But... If you look under the hood... Then, you will see the passion and love behind it. An enormous imagination and determination from it's creator, George Lucas, is simply flowing through every pore of this movie. And now remember that all of this was made in 70-s, with a limited budget (that was mostly spent on stuff that was never used in the movie) and technology, a lot of problems during shooting, publishers that didn't believe in the project and you will understand why this movie is so important and why you cannot be objective to it. There was nothing like this when this came out, and in some ways, there is nothing like this all these years later. It's a magical experience and I can only imagine how amazing it was to grow up with this movie and it's sequels. There's not a lot more one can say here. If you don't like this movie and the Star Wars franchise as a whole, there is nothing I can tell you here that will change your mind. If you do like it, then you know what I'm talking about. 10/10! I recommend it to everyone! There's a beautiful story to be experienced here!"
ompaldhir,"Aug 23, 2022",10/10,"How can you make such a fantastic movie in 1977? How can you have so much creativity? Star Wars has incredible special effects and astounding creativity, as much as in the story as in this imaginary universe."
blakeh-45757,"Oct 11, 2022",10/10,"I saw this in August 1979 on the first theatrical re release. I was 7 turning 8. It changed my world and blew my mind. To be 8 when Empire came out and 11 when Jedi premiered , I was the generation that was lucky enough to experience these in the theatres where they belong. Having just watched the whole series on Showcase this weekend, albeit with commercials on a 30 inch screen, I find the last three insufferable. Noisy commercial filler. I get frustrated with the young generation rating the originals poorly, that lower the IMBD overall rating. They have no ability to realize how life changing these were for a generation. Compared to anything at the time, Star Wars was Wayne Gretzky, the GOAT. Of course, the pace is a little slower, but I will take them any day of the week over 1-3 and 6-9. Empire Strikes Back is the best sequel to anything....ever."
mfellipecampos,"Nov 22, 2019",10/10,"Star Wars (later: Star Wars, later relaunched as Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope) Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope is an American epic / space opera, the first the eponymous saga to be released on May 25, 1977, and the fourth in the chronological plot, written and directed by George Lucas. It tells the story of young farmer Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), who, along with smuggler Han Solo (Harrison Ford), engages in the Galactic Civil War between the tyrant Galactic Empire and the Rebel Alliance after acquiring the Droids R2-D2 and C3PO. That first contains the plans for the Empire's super weapon, Death Star, which rebel leader Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) hopes to use to destroy the super weapon. Luke Skywalker dreams of going to the Academy like his friends, but finds himself embroiled in an intergalactic war when his uncle buys two robots and finds a message from Princess Leia Organa to jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi about the plans to build the Star of the Moon. Death, a gigantic space station capable of destroying a planet. Luke then joins the jedi gentlemen and Hans Solo, a mercenary, to try to destroy this terrible threat alongside the members of the resistance. Watching Star Wars for the first time today and I found fascinating technologies from that era that led many people to be impressed by the size it took. So my movie rating is 10.0.Movie watched on May 23, 2019"

I find it a bit pointless to review films like this, because I really have never met anyone who hasn't seen it, however, considering I've seen it over 57 times, it's worth a mention, yes I know that's not much compared to some people(someone I know saw it 377 times!!! This film hasn't aged at all and is still so much fun. It has everything a fantasy/sci-fi/ adventure should have, and if you haven't seen it yet, then where have you been!! The sequels The empire strikes back, and return of the jedi are almost as good. But not the phantom menace!"
sausagebrigade,"Aug 1, 2003",6/10,"Star Wars is one of those movies you have to see as a kid. I saw it in 1997 and it instantly changed my view on movies. However, six years later, my tastes in movies have changed and Star Wars seems disappointing. The acting is mostly lacklustre, even from Alec Guinness, who looks bored of the whole exercise. It seems a shame that Sir Alec would be doomed to be remembered as Obi-Wan Kenobi for the rest of his career, as it's hardly a good part. Elsewhere, the effects are getting worse as the years pass, although the Death Star trench run still excites after countless viewings. And anyway, at least it's better than the prequels."
velvets203,"Jan 12, 2005",10/10,"Say what you will about this movie, its legions of fans, its prequels and sequels. No other set of movies is as well-liked by both ""geek"" and normal cinema lovers than Star Wars. People of all ages, race, and gender enjoy the movie, unlike many other cult-ish sci-fi movies (Star Trek anyone?) This movie has crossed all culture barriers, with characters, lines, and creatures all well known from one set of movies. You have to live under a rock to not know some of the story lines, statements and characters from this film. The funny thing is how some special effects from this movie look BETTER than some effects made in the 2000's (The Rock in Mummy Returns, anyone??) CGI, to someone like me, just can't compete with scale models, puppets, and camera tricks. I highly recommend this movie to the five people in the universe that have not seen it yet. 25 years later, and it is still, and will forever be, a classic. 10 of 10"
Luke_P,"Feb 8, 1999",7/10,"""Star Wars is the greatest movie of all time"" claim the pundits. Nonsense. Star Wars is a good action movie, a reasonable science fiction movie, and a bad character movie. There is insufficient plot to fill out the amount of time you have to sit, and the special effects look like they were made more than 20 years ago. At its time this was a very good movie. It is a very influential movie, but it is not as watchable as Aliens or even Star Trek: First Contact.Of the lead 6 good guys:Two are incapable of human speech, and make noises that are supposed to provoke emotion, but just sound stupid.Two are now famous actors, one (Ford) showing what he does that makes him so popular, showing off his strength as an actor, and the other (Fisher) showing why she is no longer famous.One is an annoying weak wooden robot...and the other is C3PO.Mark Hamill is one of the weakest lead actors of our time, and the fact that three of his movies are rated in the top 50 movies of all time is very questionable.On the other hand, the special effects were impressive then, and are mildly impressive now. Lucas and Spielberg are two of the most impressive visionariesand directors of our time. Watch the film, but don't push it down other people's throats."
sddavis63,"Feb 5, 2016",5/10,"A confession right off the top: I'm not a Star Wars fan. This original came out when I was a teenager. Everyone was so into it that I finally had to watch it. I did. And I didn't like it. I realize that puts me very much in the minority, but - whatever - I just didn't like it. I was totally bored with it for the most part and I've never watched it or any of its sequels (or prequels) since, until I rewatched this just a few days ago. My brother in law decided that my daughter had to be introduced to the Star Wars phenomenon, so he brought the DVDs of those first three movies over and we sat and watched the first one. My daughter's 11 - and wise. She agreed with me. ""Do we have to watch the other two, dad? I was bored."" ""Yes, honey, your uncle brought them over to watch with us, so we'll watch them when he's over."" So, eventually, I'll get to watch ""The Empire Strikes Back"" and ""Return of the Jedi."" I'm as enthusiastic as my daughter.So, to this movie. I was still bored with it. It has one of the least interesting beginnings I've ever come across. It's a struggle to watch the first hour or so. And once the action really starts - it's just a gigantic space battle, and I just don't buy that good old Luke Skywalker can go from farm boy to ace fighter pilot like that. And really you have to mix in some pretty weak performances - especially from the two main leads. There's a reason that Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher never really did much after Star Wars. They're just not that good! Harrison Ford is the only one who managed to turn his role in this into a big-time acting career - but, let's face it, most people remember him as Indiana Jones and not Han Solo. Granted that George Lucas got some big names in this - Alec Guiness as Obi-Wan Kenobi and James Earl Jones as the voice of Darth Vader. But the newer, younger crowd of actors just wasn't that good. And then there were the aliens. Some of the worst looking aliens I've ever seen - especially in the bar scene in Mos Eisley. I really loved the alien who looked like a green-ish burlap sack with bright buttons sewed on for eyes. Add on some ridiculous dialogue and irritating droids who get far too much of the ridiculous dialogue to top it off.Those are things that stand out for me that just didn't work for me. I'm not dissing ""Star Wars"" completely. There were some good things about it. Give George Lucas credit for imagination. This was a very interesting and imaginative universe he created. And the space battles were pretty well done - I just thought there was too much of it. And let's face it - Darth Vader has become an iconic character; one of the greats in Hollywood history. Everybody knows Darth Vader - whether they like Star Wars or not. And ""the Force."" Who doesn't know about ""the Force."" Something has worked well when characters and other things get sealed in the popular imagination. And I admit again that I am in the minority. You can't deny that Star Wars has become a cultural phenomenon. I may not understand it, or buy into it, but I can't deny it. To some extent, it really re- invigorated what had become a tired concept - space-based sci-fi. (I'm sure it's no coincidence that ""Star Trek"" - which was being planned as a TV relaunch as I understand it - actually ended up appearing on the big screen not long after the amazing success of ""Star Wars."") So Star Wars changed a lot of things and created a legion of fans that lasts to this day. I can't deny any of that. And yet, I still can't bring myself to really like this movie. But since I can't deny its impact and importance - it gets a 5/10 from me."
Moosey-2,"Jun 3, 1999",10/10,"Star Wars: A New Hope is a great film.  It started the whole Star Wars universe (that is for all of us who aren't George Lucas) and gave us a look into a primitive futuristic past.  I, being a die hard Star Wars fan, believe that anything that is remotely related to Star Wars deserves a good look over and this definitely beats a lot of other movies to the top.  The only thing that I can fine wrong is the acting.  Most of the actors have gone on and improved very much in their acting abilities like Harrison Ford. But in the beginning he was not very good in fact I would even call his acting stiff.  But we should give him a break because, this was his second movie after ""American Grafitti.""  The only thing that got on my nerves throughout the whole movie was how whiney Luke is.  Lines like ""Uncle Owen, Uncle Owen??"" are screamed at a whiney high pitched voice.  But otherwise a great film."

whizkids,"Sep 25, 2004",8/10,"OK, this was a pretty good movie with some pretty good effects (just make sure you don't overwatch it, or you'll get bored with it).The idea for Star Wars is pretty good. I loved the character of Darth Vader. I'm not saying I'm rooting for the bad guys, I'm saying that the idea of Vader is an interesting idea. I mean, think about it. The Jedi order is abolished, and the only one who is allowed to use the Force is the Sith (the dark side of the Force).My favorite characters are Han Solo, Chewbacca and R2-D2. I like Luke too, but I don't think he became a real big big favorite until ROTJ. I also enjoyed Obi-Wan Kenobi.The effects are fantastic, especially for its time. The aliens are interesting, the bad guys are well-done (though how humans came to be the dominant species is a little surprising. Sorry, but compared to some of the other beings I saw in the Star Wars universe, it's a little surprising). I love the lightsabers and just about everything about this movie. The only problem I have is with the Force, as pretty much all Christians do. But we're able to draw enough Christian elements out of it to tolerate it.humor, action, and a lot of tension with Solo and Leia, very, very good. I don't know if it deserved the standing ovations it got in the theaters, but still great. A new hope indeed!"
Funkypizza2001,"Apr 4, 2002",10/10,"STAR WARS: A NEW HOPESTARRING: MARK HAMILL, CARRIE FISHER, HARRISON FORD, AND ALEC GUINNESSLet's face it. No matter how many movies come out with BIGGER special effects, MORE evil characters and UNFORGETTABLE good characters... none will be better than the first Star Wars. From the get go, we fell in love with curious young Luke Skywalker, and we felt we wanted the adventure Hans Solo was constantly looking for. We felt grief for Princess Leia when she was captured by the evil Darth Vader and we all wanted a grandfather like Obi Wan Kenobi. Hell, we even wanted Chewbacca as a pet instead of a dog. This movie is a classic, hands down. Who cares if it's not your type of movie, acknowledge the fact that we're lucky a movie so wonderful like this even exists. A movie that has paved the way for so many other Sci-Fi's. A movie that has and always will stand the test of time.I give this film ***** stars out of *****."
dangeroussway,"Jan 5, 2024",7/10,"There's been so much said about this movie. The expansive lore that came from this film is stuff of legend. Probably one if the largest franchises in all of cinema history. With all that hype, does it hold up? I'd say yes!This could be the perfect movie; it's never boring, each scene is distinctive and memorable and the events transition into each other seamlessly. The music is incredible, the production and set design is jaw-dropping with the world it created. The characters are likable.The framing device of being from the point of view of C3PO and R2-D2 and we essentially follow them the entire time but they're not even the main characters is insane.Side note- there's a lot of anti-droidism, almost an allegory for slavery and classism- in this that I don't think gets talked about enough.This movie really does have much to discuss and appreciate- the big bad taste in my mouth though is the only way this film is now officially released is the awful edit George Lucas did in the late '90's. He effectively ruined the experience of this movie and stopped any legal way to watch in its original form. This brings it down a lot."

It has made millions in the box office and has made us fans of the brilliant Yoda, Chewbacca, Anakin, Luke, Padema, and more. I am not a Star Wars fan but I do enjoy the movies very much. They are a George Lucas masterpiece that will live in Hollywood for centuries and centuries. I gave it a 10/10 for the scifi stuff and all the cool effects in the movie itself.

robgargiulosh,"Jun 21, 2021",7/10,"Star Wars well deserves its reputation as a classic but it's overrated in general. John Williams score alone is a masterpiece.

hamlet-16,"Sep 19, 2004",4/10,"Star Wars, despite the butchering of the film in the late 90s remains a classic example of what Hollywood does best....great entertainment.Although highly derivative of just about every fairytale and comic serial, the film is so well put together that once you are on board for the ride it doesn't matter.Lucas has a very grand vision and the visual effects, whilst not quite up to 21st century digital effects certainly are effective.This film ushered in the modern era of use of sound which had languished since the early days of stereo soundtracks in the 1950s.Who can deny the impact of the opening sequence, especially in the cinema, of the starship zooming over the audience. It is one of the most brilliant beginnings to a film ever.(Even if the film unions despised not having opening titles!)It is a pity that DVD release does not have the original versions of the Star Wars trilogy. The bastardised digital updates from the late 1990s are simply not as good. Sorry Mr Lucas you are wrong to think they are better. The few extra special effects don't work and are very obvious.The new Star Wars movies simply do not have the magic of this film and its companion originals. The overuse of digital effects and the annoying JarJar simply emphasise this.But Star Wars is THE original and it is a must have in any film buff collection."
kenjha,"Oct 12, 2007",9/10,"The one that began it all is also the best in the series. Whereas the later films become too bogged down with plot and perhaps take themselves too seriously, this one is just plain fun. It pays homage to the great adventure films of yesteryear, including ""The Searchers."" Hamill and Fisher failed to capitalize on the success of this series while Ford parlayed his role as the wise-cracking Han Solo into super-stardom. Despite his disdain for the film, Guinness is masterful as Obi-Wan. The majestic score by John Williams definitely adds to the excitement. Interestingly, Lucas did not direct the two sequels, but returned to direct the second trilogy."
lakefx,"Dec 29, 2015",10/10,"Star Wars. The theater was black except for the small light coming from the projector onto the big silver screen in front of a 7 year old boy. His eyes glued and wide in anticipation of a film that he knew very little about other than an adventure in space, a place where he always dreamt of escaping to. When the first note trumpeted out of the speakers for the first time, his heart pounded and his soul was free. This universe that George Lucas had captured and the young man, Luke Skywalker, was the embodiment of the dreamy eyed young 7 year old now watching, vicariously living in that universe. From that point on, I grew a little more hopeful for the future, that 7 year old's spirit still laughing, smiling and even crying inside, encouraging me to escape what I thought a terrifying life of abuse from peers and my own subjugating voice telling me I'd never be anything but a loser. This movie's storyline was inspiring to me as an artist, writer, actor and human being. The underlying religious connotations I've never considered religious overload, merely to believe in something bigger than oneself, an energy that encompasses everything, everyone. At this point at the end of 2015, almost 40 years after its release, I am still drawn into that flicker of light and that very first note, a glimpse into what can be, a piece of my own new hope.May the Force be with you all."
quakeulf,"Apr 4, 2007",9/10,"I have seen the first three movies evolve from their VHS-releases to their newest DVD-releases. Of the three movies of the ""ancient era"", this really sticks out as the best of them all.I was very young the first time I saw this, and it captured me with its fantastic creatures, the action, the whole universe was so convincing to me, and the characters were really good and left a good impression on me. Seeing it again more than 15 years later, still makes me feel like I did back then.This movie is obviously very influenced by 2001: A space odyssey, as seen in the interior design of the rebel space ship in the opening scene, and the docking scenes with the Death Star. Not that it's a bad thing, it is something I felt added a lot to this movie.Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi both fail to keep up with the goodness of this movie in terms of consistency and use of scenes. In particular, there is this new CG-enhanced music scene in Return of the jedi that is so embarrassing to watch it almost destroyed the movie, and the coming of the Ewoks just goes from bad to worse. Luckily, Star Wars does not have this sort of bumpy-ride feel to it, and one that had the most graceful evolution of the three movies with the new releases, except for the ""Han shot first""-scene treatment.9/10"
highflier81,"Jan 23, 2005",10/10,"Not really. Almost 30 years later, Star Wars is a household name. It would be a challenge to find someone who has never heard of Mr. Lucas's little adventure story. This highly imaginative story is one that almost anyone could find enjoyable. The weaving of action, adventure, drama, conflict, and a plethora of other genres and literary devices is absolutely remarkable. All of this encased in a theme of science fiction is a clear cut example that great writing is just that, great writing. A New Hope along with its sequels, especially the two that followed, TESB and ROTJ will be remembered for a very very long time, even in a galaxy far, far away."

It would have really been something if this movie won the Oscar for Best Picture of 1977 but Sci-Fi movies aren't likley to do so. I would have given Harrison Ford an Oscar nomination because he has the best character which practically made the first three great. Alec Guiness is great as Obi Wan Kanobi and receiving a Best Supporting Actor Oscar nomination. Peter Cushing in his best role and taking a break from the Hammer horror movies. This is a movie loved by many and is a classic from beginning to end."
dr_foreman,"Oct 8, 2004",7/10,"Though I like ""Star Wars"" in isolation, I'm angry about what it did to science fiction and to movies as a whole.Let's be honest; although this is great entertainment, it does lack depth and sensitivity. The characters are all archetypes: the roguish Han, the sagely Kenobi, the brash youngster Luke. And let's not forget Darth Vader (""Dark Invader""?), who seems to have stepped right out of a 1950s pulp magazine. I like these folks - I grew up with them - but fascinating people they ain't.The film only works because it plays to very basic emotions and themes. Luke wants to leave home and see the universe. The Empire is evil - just evil, who needs an explanation? And though there's hardware and technology on display everywhere, it's ultimately faith and spiritualism (in the form of the Force) that saves the day. It's a very positive flick, but what is really the message? If you have a moment of Zen in the cockpit of your X-Wing, you'll be able to guide your torpedoes right down the throat of that evil space station? Strange that this moment means so much to so many people.Don't get me wrong; I love good sci-fi. But I was actually raised on the more cerebral stuff - the sci-fi that discusses issues instead of wages wars. ""Star Wars"" is firmly in the latter camp; it has great combat, but not great drama. And it has inspired so many feeble imitators (pick one, there's a million of them) and forced the advancement of special effects so far that movies have been forever changed, for the worse, because of it. After this, movies were all about faster paces and bigger bangs. The 1970s, a very meaningful decade for cinema, gave way to the shallow sci-fi spectacle of the 80s...and this is the movie that's responsible for that regrettable shift in emphasis."

michael_the_nermal,"Feb 23, 2007",7/10,"""Star Wars"" is a good movie, but it is nowhere near the cinematic masterpiece fans and the AFI claim it to be. It is an interesting and often exciting adventure story with elements of mysticism and Kurosawa flicks spun into a science fiction landscape. It's fun for a Saturday afternoon matinée, but it seems a bit silly to compare this movie to, say, ""Citizen Kane"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey.""The acting is fair. None of the stars, with several big exceptions, wowed me with their portrayal of allegedly mythic heroes. Mark Hamill, as Luke Skywalker, still seems a little green around the edges, and is far from being a mature hero. Princess Leia, played by Carrie Fisher, also seems a bit immature as the ""damsel in distress,"" and her acting is a bit wooden. No, the most intriguing character in this movie, and arguably the biggest star and electric dynamo of the ""Star Wars"" franchise, is Han Solo. He, unlike Luke Skywalker, is a fun guy to watch: a brilliant antihero with ambiguous morals who actually undergoes a moral transformation in the movie, from gruff space pirate to reluctant member of the Rebel Alliance. Ford clearly know how to make this character come to life. Unlike Luke, Han Solo is a macho man's man, a guy who's tough and not a pure hero. Ford's acting, unlike Hamill's or Fisher's, is the most convincing, most emotional, and the most fun to watch. It's no coincidence that ""Star Wars"" made a Hollywood A-list star out of Ford, rather than Fisher or Hamill, and that Spielberg and Lucas later chose him to be the title hero for the equally successful ""Indiana Jones"" movies. The reason Ford came out on top above all the others stars is that, well, he's just that good!Other actors who do well include Alec Guinness, as Obi-Wan Kenobi, and body-builder Daivd Prowse as Darth Vader. I think poor Mr. Prowse has not gotten the credit he deserves for donning the Darth Vader costume and making the role truly menacing. Sure, James Earl Jones is Vader's voice, but Prowse IS the man behind the mask, and he is just as responsible as Jones for making Lord Vader one of cinema's most iconic villains.Overall, this is a good movie, but again, not a timeless work of art for the ages. Watch it for Harrison Ford, who is one of the greatest action heroes of all time."
davelocke,"Sep 29, 1999",1/10,"I really have nothing but contempt for the Star Wars franchise.  They threw an ""A"" budget at ""F"" material and created a juvenile hit which lowered the bar for science fiction in the cinema, aborting the prior (""2001"") trend upward in story qualities and thus depriving us of who knows how many *good* science fiction movies.  These days they reach back for sf classics like Heinlein's ""The Puppet Masters"" or ""Starship Troopers"", and trash them to the point where little more than the title remains.This is not generally a movie for the fan of adult level written science fiction.  You'll need to look elsewhere for a movie which is."
flicmaster,"Apr 10, 2004",10/10,"No film can ever top this one when it comes to Sci-Fi. The genre was not much more than a drive-in movie filled with D&D players as it's only fans. This movie changed it all. This is easily one of the biggest landmarks in film history. Yes, Mr. Lucas has done some strange things as far as releases and changing things go. I won't get in to that except to say that they are his films, and he can do with them as he will. That aside, this film is one of those great movies that has just a purely awesome story, is not boring for adults and yet it is MPAA rated such that the young can also enjoy it without being bombarded by violence or vulgar language. I'm all for films with those elements, but it takes a special film to be successful without them. In closing, I can say that this was one of the great experiences of my childhood, a perfect 10."
Al_The_Strange,"May 5, 2013",10/10,"In the summer of 1977, during a time when most motion pictures were all about being rough and gritty, Star Wars exploded onto the scene with its fresh take on classic adventurism and epic storytelling. The immense popularity that followed ensured that it beat the odds against a skeptical studio that never saw the viability of the franchise, and ensured its resounding success for decades. It has since become the progenitor of all modern blockbuster films.Whether you start the series here or with the modern prequel The Phantom Menace, you'll be immediately submerged into a unique and original universe. Great care and consideration is placed into every person, place, and thing in the series, with an exceptional level of background and detail. Entering the Star Wars universe is one of the deepest and most lively franchises, even to this day.The story kicks off right in the middle of a big space pursuit, and maintains steadily fast pacing throughout. The original special effects have always been impressive, with loads of quality models and matte paintings that still hold up. There are a number of added CGI scenes from the '97 update, which haven't aged that well. But what really matters is the spirit of the movie; whether lurking around the seedy underbelly of Mos Eisley, or storming the decks of the Death Star, the movie is loaded with action and comedy, and it takes itself seriously only when it has to. The resulting thrill ride is as lighthearted as it is exciting and memorable.Borrowing directly from Kurosawa's The Hidden Fortress, and with some influence by classic sci-fi serials like Buck Rogers, the story for this is not terribly original, but it is a solid and fresh take on the genre, with a cast of fine characters. The biggest and most original contribution is Luke Skywalker's journey from being a humble farm boy to being the hero of the Rebel Alliance (featuring themes that echo Lucas' previous film American Graffiti). The film's structuring allows for a steady introduction to all the characters and concepts, making it easily digestible and continuously iconic.The film is competently-made, with solid photography and editing. Special effects are groundbreaking for its time. At times, I feel that the imagery with the given camera angles, lighting effects, costume and set designs, are like an evolution of THX1138, lending the film a slick futuristic appeal. Acting tends to be a bit hammy in all the Star Wars films, but are probably at their best here; Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, and Sir Alec Guinness bring the characters to life in a vivid and memorable way. Writing can be quite nutty, but the dialogue is memorable. All of the film's sets, props, costumes, and special effects are swell, even if they do show their age a little. And the music is excellent; John Williams' original score matches the movie perfectly, and is exceptional.5/5 (Entertainment: Perfect | Story: Perfect | Film: Perfect)"
OriginalMovieBuff21,"May 1, 2004",9/10,"Star Wars is an amazing fantasy sci-fi film full of laughs, cool action, and dark scenes. You will have a fun time watching this. Harrison Ford was really great as Han Solo and is extremely funny. Mark Hamill does a surprising role as Luke Skywalker, the brave, young jedi and believe it or not, the one and only, Darth Vader. He was so cool as his character who was played by James Earl Jones. The special effects are kind of cheesey, but c'mon it was made in 1977. I mean give it a break. Also the duel fights are kind of chessey to but oh well, I still love it. Star Wars is great even for kids because it's only PG. Just shut-up and enjoy this movie. You'll have a fun time!!9.5/10"
angelkirstie88,"Sep 1, 2005",10/10,"This movie really impressed my the moment it began. I gasped as I saw how advanced the movie was since it was only made in the late 70s. To me, it's one of the best movies ever made. Despite the lack of technology, the movie still came along as one of the best masterpieces and I have to agree, it cannot be compared to the the new Star Wars movies which are totally horrifying.Basic Plot: It begins with the Empire trying to take the princess' ship so that they could know where the rebel area is when C-3PO and R2D2 go on to Tatooine and find look who goes on to save Leia, who is his sister and falls in love with her.Great watch! Watch it now!"
GOWBTW,"Mar 9, 2007",10/10,"This is one sci-fi movie that is an absolute keeper! Star Wars is a gem. The characters, the plot, the technology, and the special effects really put you in a total state of awe. Here you have a walking tyrant named Darth Vader, a human iron lung who has a strong craving for power. He uses the mystical power known as The Force to get get anything in his will. The Force choke is wicked! Then you have Luke Skywalker(Mark Hamill), a simple farm boy who wants to go to the academy, then he and his uncle purchased some droids that have some important information to an old Jedi named Ben ""Obi-Wan"" Kenobi(Alec Guinness), who has kept a light-saber from his old student Anakin Skywalker(Darth Vader). I liked the scene where Luke, Han Solo(Harrison Ford), and Chewbacca(Peter Mayhew) took out the StormTroopers. Then there's the Death Star battle. A real gem. When they showed the extra scenes later in the years, it's worth the watch even more! The commercials, the ads, the toys, the movie isn't a hit without them, and George Lucas will get kudos from me! 5 Stars!"
Dockelektro,"May 15, 2002",10/10,"This one was the dawn of a new way to see movies. This movie created a heritage, and a cult movemement that will probably never end. ""Star Wars"" is by far the greatest cult movie ever, and it changed the way people make and see sci-fi today.Of course, this was a tightrope work, and it shows. The success wasn't insured, and George Lucas really risked it here, and one can tell by the quality of the overall movie that this one wasn't so financed as Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi. But it remains an absolute classic, and the Special Edition in 1997 really souped it up, adding cool effects and new sequences, making the experience even better. This movie started a legacy, and even today, one the eve of seeing the new chapter, I know I can see it without getting tired. The force will always be with the people who see this."
IkuharaKunihiko,"Mar 1, 2005",7/10,"I think everything about this sci-fi story is known to everyone. ""Star Wars"" grossed 460 million $ in U.S. cinemas making it the most commercial movie of the 1970s. It was also nominated for a Golden Globe for best picture, director and supporting actor Alec Guiness. For all those categories it was nominated also for an Oscar. The movie won 7 Oscars, but only in technical categories, while the one for best picture went to Woody Allen's ""Annie Hall"". Many were outraged at that Oscar decision, but I think this is one of the few times I would agree with the academy.I like ""Star Wars"", really I do. It made so many people nostalgic but I noticed that I truly loved it only when I was a kid, and not now while I'm a grown up. Strange irony; back then I hated ""Annie Hall"", today its one of my favorite movies( Grade:10/10 ). What's the problem with ""Star Wars""? I think it has only about 15 % of the magic that is anticipated while you watch its poster.-------------------------------Take the characters for instance. They are all one dimensional. We never find out more about Luke's life on the farm. We never see him taking a bath, sleeping, going out with his friends or being in love. Chewbacca is so silly that you don't know if he is a animal or an intelligent being that's mentally ill. The only character that is developed is the cynical Han Solo ( I wish there were more lines from him like the one when he says to Obi-Wan that he thinks that the whole Force theory is a joke ). Look at how quirky the characters are in animes like ""Slayers""! The best scene was the one where the two Sunsets can be seen from Luke's planet. That was real magic, unlike other sequences which were more action oriented. I guess the thing that is the most problematic is the almost total lack of emotions. The utopic story is cold and not interested in drama. I wonder what Jean-Luc Godard or Joel Coen could have made if they had directed ""Star Wars"".""Star Wars"" is a good film and its creation of Darth Wader is classic, but looking at its wooden story you just can't but not to wonder if the whole cult thing around it( its no. 9 on IMDb's top 250 films )may have never been started if the special effects weren't so grand.Grade: 6/10"
dee.reid,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"It seems that the honoring of George Lucas with the Lifetime Achievement Award could not have come at a better time for the visionary and imaginative filmmaker. With ""Episode III"" still raking in sold-out crowds six weeks after its release, Lucas is pretty much on top of the world. But what about the film that started it all, ""Star Wars"" (1977)? What's left to say about it? Every good thing that has and can be said about it has been said already, ever since it debuted in the summer of '77 and changed the way we looked at movies, and the way people made them. ""Star Wars"" is sheer imagination run amok, taking place a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, with farmboy Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) discovering the two droids C-3PO and R2-D2, the latter droid of which contains a holographic image of a distress call from Princess Leia Organa (Carrie Fisher). The Princess is being held captive by Grand Moff Tarkin (Peter Cushing) and his fearsome military commander Darth Vader (played by David Prowse and voiced by James Earl Jones), the dark lord of the Sith, on the newly constructed Death Star battle station. Skywalker, taking advantage of an opportunity to leave behind boring farm life, seeks out the mysterious Obi Wan Kenobi (the late Alec Guiness, in an Oscar-nominated performance) and the two journey to a Mos Eisley watering hole to enlist the aid of swashbuckling space pirate Han Solo (Harrison Ford), pilot of the Millennium Falcon, and his Wookie sidekick Chewbacca - their adventures resulting in them joining the Rebel Alliance - culminating in one of the greatest screen battles, which is the Rebel assault on the Death Star at the film's climatic conclusion. Lucas brought forth this ambitious vision to stunning reviews and a devoted fanbase that has established ""Star Wars"" as a subculture within pop culture. It's impossible to call this film dated in any fashion, given that Lucas often had to resort to imagination to get things done on this project since budget constraints allowed for such creativity. When I saw ""Star Wars"" for the first time when I was kid, it took my breath away, as I'm sure it did to everyone else that saw it for the first time. That initial viewing sticks with you, and as a result the film never looses its impact. ""Star Wars"" was of course followed by the somber ""The Empire Strikes Back"" (1980) and the triumphant ""Return of the Jedi"" (1983), both of which are also considered classics in themselves. And with the prequel trilogy (1999's ""The Phantom Menace,"" 2002's ""Attack of the Clones,"" the aforementioned 2005 conclusion ""Revenge of the Sith"") out of the way, there is word out that Lucas isn't done with ""Star Wars,"" and may be looking to start a new trilogy. But with all this, we still need to look back at the film that started it all, the film with nothing left to talk about, the original ""Star Wars"" (1977).10/10"
AKS-6,"Oct 27, 1999",7/10,"I know that there are few movies out there which are as much loved as ""Star Wars"". So, I think I should say this straight away; I do *not* think that this film deserves all the praise and all the hype it's gotten over the last 22 years. However, I do like this film, it's just that it is so full of clichés that one more cliché would've made it a very silly film. As it is now, it's not silly, it's a good film for kids. I don't say that to try to put the film down, there's nothing wrong with children's films. Look at the best Disney films for example! Some of them are masterpieces. And I really like fantasy films like ""Star Wars"" even if I think that e.g. ""Time Bandits"" is a better film. Having said that, there is nothing really wrong with ""Star Wars"", it's good entertainment. It's rather funny (I like interplay between R2-D2 and C-3PO) and apart from the clichés (though they are overwhelming) it is a rather nice story -- for kids. Not being a child I do demand much more from a film's script than this, but I was still very entertained while I watched ""Star Wars"" and my vote for it here at IMDb was a 6 (out of 10)."
pha-2,"Dec 24, 1998",1/10,"Usually I loooove mindless action movies.  Usually I'm all for senseless violence in films.  And usually, I like little furry creatures.  But here's what I hate- STAR WARS STAR WARS STAR WARS!!!  This is the a silly, hugely over-rated, egotistical, boring, contrived, joyless, cheap and morally bankrupt piece of garbage.  There is simply nothing entertaining about this movie, or any of the trilogy.  The acting is silly and self-indulgent. The story is a very tired hairball hacked up from the throats of who knows how many fairy tales (save the princess, save the universe, etc.).  I wouldn't be so vehement if it weren't for the fact that Star Wars is soooo popular and it's evvveryone's favorite.  *hack*  And people say Titanic is over-rated?  Hello? People aren't going to be jumping up and down over Titanic 20 years from now.  People are still screaming about Star Wars, but this film/trilogy is anything but something that could be considered a classic.  Lucas is NOT a genius, Darth Vader is a candy-a** villian, and, gentle reader, Luke Skywalker is a putz."
villebaillie,"Jul 31, 2005",10/10,"The reasons I love Star Wars, especially episode IV, are numerous. I love it because it opened space opera to the masses. I love it because of the humanity of the characters. I love it because of the relationships between the characters. I love it because it's fun, it just is, it's a fun movie. I don't see how people can dislike the actors, to me the acting is charming and enjoyable and even a form of escapism.I think the reason some don't like the film is because they do not appreciate it for what it is. Perhaps they prefer films that just provide entertainment in it's simplest form. In which case I would not say it is for you. The entertainment in this film comes in many layers.What this film is, is an escape to a galaxy far, far away, yet it feels so close to home. A nobody goes off and becomes somebody. Adventure is the order of the day. Knight rescues damsel from sinister fortress. The film is extremely fast paced and not in key with traditional sci-fi, that is why it is so accessible to so many.With the prequels I felt I just didn't care about the characters. In the original trilogy the characters are bonded to you by steel. The death of (so and so) is so powerful. When the old man with the white beard dies, you care. Gandalf? Who the hell is Gandalf?It doesn't have the darkness of the empire strikes back or the digital polish of the prequels, but it does make up for it with sheer good-natured, puppyish enthusiasm. It's my favourite in the series for all these reasons and more.Thrilling from beginning to end."
NQ-Mobile-Omar-Khan,"Jan 29, 2014",9/10,"When this movie came out back in the days I couldn't understand most of it. I was young, I didn't knew a thing about space travel, plasma stuff or force fantasies. Over the time I must have watched it over 50 times and bit by bit I understood more and more and this movie grew into my heart.The effects were colossal at the time, unheard and unseen. Can you imagine a light saber back in the 70's? I mean wow... And the costumes - glorious. And the story was marvelous on it's own, it was a space western. A new, unexplored genre full with space action. The music was made by geniuses, it was powerful and memorable. Acting not so great I presume..."
SDunne17,"Mar 17, 2005",8/10,"In 1977 the entertainment industry was not quite up to the 21st century standards. The special effects in Star wars are not fantastic but they would have been in their time. Still, Star Wars is the best film ever made, it was released in a time where people were using special effects for disaster movies and no one thought it would do that well but it took the UK and America by storm and it became he 4th most attended movie ever (but the 3 above it: Snow White, Sound of music and Gone with the wind have all been re-released so it's pretty unfair) and the 2nd highest ever grossing film (Behind Titanic which was released over 20 years later when ticket prices were over double the price). The nobodies who played the parts became huge actors of the time, Harrison Ford is hailed as the most successful actor of all time. The rest of the trilogy was also very good, Empire strikes back is also one of the best films ever (dunno what happened in the Phantom Menace though, whose idea was Jar Jar Binks?) All in all i think it's a pretty good film."
CalDexter,"Oct 4, 2004",10/10,"Star Wars was the film that changed cinema forever. It had everything, brilliant special effects, a scary villain, fully built set pieces that you had never seen before, a brilliant music score from John Williams and likable characters in Han Solo and Obi-wan Kenobi well played by Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness. It was a film that had blazing action from start to finish, it was a film that the writer and director George Lucas had intended for children, his target audience was twelve and under, but it became a true mega blockbuster and people of all ages came again and again, dragging their friends with them.My favourite scenes include the opening sequence: the massive imperial Star Destroyer roaring over the screen attacking the fleeing rebel cruiser, that scene is mind-blowing on a cinema screen, i love the introduction of Darth Vader emerging from the smoke of the laser battle between the Stormtroopers and the Rebels, i also like the way Vader is established as an evil killer right away when he crushes the neck of some poor hapless rebel prisoner holding him up with one hand and throwing him to the side like a rag doll, this gives Vader's character a sense of malevolence from the kickoff.I also like the lightsaber duel between obi-wan and Vader on the Death Star more so for the verbal exchanges between the two Jedi 'When i was with you i was but the learner now i am the master.' Obi-wan:'Only a master of evil DARTH!!!' The duel is not as energetic as Luke and Vader in The Empire Strikes Back, but it is still a powerful and moving moment especially when Luke, Han and Leia make a dash for the falcon and Luke sees Obi-wan cornered by Vader. That scene is one of emotion that Lucas hits right on the head, Luke sees Obi-wan's plight, Obi-wan smiles at Vader, he raises his sabre and closes his eyes, Vader strikes as look screams 'NO!' and John Williams score swells with tragic loss as Luke blasts away at the Stormtroopers. Its the one scene that sticks in my mind about A New Hope, that isn't special effects or cgi.The final aerial assault between TIE fighters and X-wing fighters over the Death Star is perhaps the most exciting finale of any movie, the tunnel chase with Luke's X-wing and Vader's TIE fighter thrills ALL the time. Finally i have to say when i talk to people who have seen Star wars in any shape or form, rarely do they say they don't like the movies, but when i do meet someone that hates these classics they ALWAYS say the same thing: 'Im not really interested in films.' That says it all, does it not?"
neon47,"Jun 8, 2005",10/10,"Of course now it's not really a trilogy anymore is it? But the title refers to episodes 4-6. Now on to the review: Star Wars is hands down the best clash of good and evil any person can find in movies ever. For those who haven't seen it, and shame if you haven't, this one kicks off in the middle of a war in space between the Emperor and the Rebels. Luke lives on a desert planet and longs to join the rebellion, but can't because his Uncle Ben doesn't want him to. Shortly into the movie the family purchases some droids and Luke soon finds a message hidden in R2D2's data for an Obi Wan Kenobi. Things kick into gear once Luke follows the droid to Kenobi's house and thus begins the adventure. Obi Wan believes that Luke can turn out to be a Jedi just like his father was and takes him under his wing teaching him the way of the Force once they get off Tattooin. During the movie you'll run into the memorable characters like the evil Darth Vader, the cocky Han Solo, Chewy the Wookie, and Princess Leia. Hands down episodes 4-6 are the best trilogy ever created. See it now if you haven't already."
Altaira,"Jun 28, 1999",N/A,"It's 1999, 22 years since the original release of Star Wars, and we still have people flocking to SW conventions, dedicating entire web sites to SW, spending hundreds of dollars on posters and action figures, and generally assuring that the SW frenzy will live forever. Okay, I'm not critical of the die-hard fans, since I am one myself and very proud of that.  I am told I bear a striking resemblance to Carrie Fisher, so I dressed up like Leia for Halloween once, complete with the cinnamon-bun hair.  (I wanted to be Yoda but the costume shop said the outfit only had one ear.)  Regardless whether you're nuts about SW or not, it is a masterful exercise in filmmaking and the original movie was, of course nominated for an Academy Award.  Pretty unheard of for a sci-fi/fantasy.George Lucas famously described the trilogy as a ""three-act play."" Everyone is introduced in the first act, SW; they are placed in a dark, desperate mess in the second, ESB; and finally they get out of the hole in the final third, ROJ.  This setup works fairly well for the trilogy, although some find fault with Lucas's idea.  They say Star Wars has too little character involvement, Empire is too dark, and Return is too happy.  Everyone is entitled to his/her opinion, but I think Lucas's strategy works well in the long-term effect.  We grow to love the characters after three movies; things like that take time and sometimes multiple movies!!!Although SW is not my favorite of the three (I find it somewhat campy and unemotional,) it was a fantastic starting block and lead-in to The Empire Strikes Back, which was one of the most anticipated sequels of all time. Mark Hamill was adequate as Luke Skywalker, although the whining was a little irritating.  The aerial battle above and around the Death Star is fabulous.  James Earl Jones immortalized the ominous voice of Darth Vader. Carrie Fisher is young and tenacious (and not as drugged out as in the second movie.  I'm not cruel, just honest!) And Harrison Ford was absolutely perfect as the rough-n-tumble Han Solo.Judging by its cult-like following (heck, even Wedge has his own fan club!), Star Wars is one of those immortal things, so you might as well love it."
martin-laste,"Oct 25, 2021",6/10,"It's alright,...for its time! I suppose if you were 10 and you were shown this in 1977 then, it might have been a great film but it's 2021 and I've watched it twice to see what I'm supposed to be missing...I'm not missing anything- it's just not that good! Someone please tell me what they see that I don't! The acting is horrendous!"
Hitchcoc,"Nov 16, 2001",9/10,"I will never forget the hoopla associated with this movie.  Having seen articles in Time and Newsweek, my friend and I took off early from work and made our way to the one theater in the Minneapolis Metro area that was showing ""Star Wars"" (boy have times changed!).  There were local news stations, reporters, models, everywhere.   How we were able to just walk to the window and purchase tickets, I don't know, but we did. I still have my blue button with ""May the Force be With You"" emblazoned on it.  I'm told it's pretty valuable.  A reporter approached us and asked my friend, ""What do you expect.""  He responded in his sort of wise ass way, ""A sprawling intergalactic epic.""That was all very interesting, but when we finally sat down and the movie began, I found it was less than I had hoped for.  Part of my problem was that at that time, most of what I read was science fiction.  As I watched the events unfold, I realized that this movie wasn't really science fiction--it was a Western.  It was the good guy versus the bad guy and an effort to save the old ranch that the bad guys have pillaged.  Take out the awesome special effects and the cool aliens and it just wasn't very interesting.  I realize that most of the people that have seen this consider it just slightly below the second coming--nearly a religious experience--but it wasn't for me.  I saw nothing new or complex about the character or the themes in the movie.  As far as speculative science fiction it is barren. Don't get me wrong, I still think that there are amazing things to watch, but I can't get past the fact that the storm troopers can't hit the broad side of a barn with laser weapons but the good guys can pick off about a dozen from behind a post.  Where did these guys get their training?  How has the Empire survived so long with these incompetents. Having read ""Dune"" years before this film came out, I have to be brutally honest--how George Lucas didn't get sued for stealing from that book, I'll never know.  I always wondered if he made a deal with Frank Herbert.The worlds are exotic.  The aliens are wonderful (although, I thought the second and third movies were much better), especially that bar scene. But the bottom line is that it's an adventure movie.  Maybe someday someone will convince me otherwise (I have had about 50 people try). If I'm going to watch a Western, I prefer the Earps and Doc Holliday."
