Andrew Devonshire,"Sep 18, 2002",10/10,"This film is superb, in fact as Shakespeare once said ""Its the bees' knees"". The film captivates the audience from the beginning.  Each of the twelve jurors are introduced to us as they are introduced to themselves. The characters are well draw out and individual, each with his own personality.The tension of the characters draws the audience in from the start.  We imagine that the case is open and shut, 11 me saying guilty and 1 not.  We feel the discomfort of Henry Fonda as the other characters belittle and mock how he can see any reasonable doubt in the case.  But we also share his victories and the enthusiasm as he proceeds to refute or add doubt to the arguments for guilty and are captivated and draw in as other jurors begin to see doubt in the proceedings.The audience can also see the arguments for guilty and wonder if Fonda's character is correct in saying that he doubts. Yet they also feel the shame of the characters as he disproves that a previously sound theory is iron tight, joining his side as members of the jury do.On top of this they are wonderfully woven in human elements such as the misconceptions that influence people and the growing tension between different characters.  This is brought to life even more by the amazing performances, Fonda, Lee J Cobb and Joseph Sweeney are of particular note.I started watching this film on a bored relaxed laying about day but by the end i was on the edge of the seat with my hands on my knees feeling more tense than a politician on results day.How a film should be made.  Modern directors take note(thats ur telling off for the day) 10/10"
tfrizzell,"Jun 8, 2002",N/A,"Intense courtroom drama which has 12 very different people, all males, struggling with a murder case involving a young Puerto Rican boy that seems cut-and-dried. However, juror Henry Fonda does not believe it to be as sure-fire as it appears. He votes not guilty and what follows is a chain of events that will test the views, beliefs and thoughts of the other 11 members. Fonda is great, but Lee J. Cobb steals every scene (and that is not easy to do in a film like this). Ed Begley, Martin Balsam, Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Joseph Sweeney, E.G. Marshall and John Fiedler are among the other individuals caught in a situation that is much more difficult than it appears on the surface. An excellent character-study that should be studied and embraced by all present and future film-makers. 5 stars out of 5."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 10, 2010",10/10,"There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups. The screenplay is sophisticated and smart, and the story is compelling and intelligent. The film is also brilliantly made, and the acting is superb. Henry Fonda especially dominates the film, with an integrity that makes his character so wonderful, but the other actors are wonderful as well, Ed Begley, Jack Warden, John Fiedler, Lee J Cobb, Rudy Bond et al. are all impeccable support to Fonda. Overall, brilliant courtroom drama. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dec 29, 2006",10/10,"Gosh, I don't know how many times I studied this play and performed it in high school, not to mention how many television shows had an episode that was inspired by 12 Angry Men. It was always a great drama because of the raw human emotions that were so true and remain timeless, this play will never be dated. I couldn't wait to see this movie when I saw it at the video store and it was the first movie I slipped into the DVD player. First off, I was incredibly impressed with the credits, we not only had Henry Fonda, we had Lee J. Cobb in the cast! This movie was so well performed and such a treasure, god, I couldn't ever say any words to justify it. I've done this a million times, but here is another summary of what 12 Angry Men is all about.12 jurors are about to make a decision about a murder case, over all it seems like an open and shut case with tons of evidence that would make any good man look guilty, an 18 year old boy is about to be put to death if convicted. 11 of the men vote guilty, only one vote holds them back and they have to discuss the trial once again due to one vote being not guilty. Jurour #8 refuses to just jump to conclusions and brings up incredible possibilities that can always make a man think of ""reasonable doubts"", one by one the jurors begin to see the points he is making, except for one stubborn #3 who would rather just pull the switch to the chair himself.12 Angry Men is a timeless tale that could either be told very badly, i.e. 7th Heaven, or incredibly well and bring out terrific performances like Henry and Lee did. Actually, the whole cast was terrific, there wasn't a performance that was off key, movies like this are so needed in Hollywood today, it was so simple, but added so much for a 30 minute play. Please, if you have any taste, you will truly enjoy 12 Angry Men and have a great appreciation for it!10/10"
jomipira,"Sep 1, 2003",9/10,"This is one of those movies where everything could go wrong. The story is as simple as it can be: 12 men are jurors on a open and shut murder trial, but one man thinks that another persons life deserves at least some thought on the matter and votes not guilty. From this point on we have 12 actors and a closed room. This could be the most boring film ever made. Lumet however is a master of mise-en-scene and provides a tense movie that keeps you locked on from the word ""go"". The dialogs are great and supported by incredibly talented actors. Joel Schumacher in Phone Booth needed to see this movie and draw a few ideas on how to make a character built, dialog driven movie. A must see for everyone."
cjyork-03423,"Mar 29, 2020",10/10,"This film is investing from start to finish. None of the performances feel like actors playing characters, but instead as people who just happen to be being filmed. The dialogue is phenomenal, the camerawork is absolutely phenomenal, the heat and claustrophobia of the environment sets in right away and gradually gets more and more intense. This film is absolutely phenomenal, and I would recommend it to absolutely anybody who enjoys film as an art form."
gcanfield-29727,"Jan 31, 2020",10/10,"In my opinion, the best movie ever made. Brilliant performances all around. A whole lot of dialogue, but you never get tired of listening. Lumet's first film-what an amazing talent. Henry Fonda and Lee J Cobb stand out, but all are excellent. There was a prior TV version, which is horrible. Lumet's version is the only one to see."
Marwan-Bob,"Jan 5, 2020",10/10,"Oh Boy Oh Boy, it Took me Seven years to Rewatch This Masterpiece, Damn why don't they make em like this Anymore."
lee_eisenberg,"Aug 6, 2005",10/10,"Shot in real time, this story of a jury trying to decide whether a young man is innocent or guilty never lets the viewer's attention go. Henry Fonda plays Juror #8, who is convinced the entire time that the defendant is innocent, while everyone else has already called him guilty. Throughout the movie, we not only get to hear everyone's opinions on the matter, but also every possibility of the verdict. With ""12 Angry Men"", Sidney Lumet brought to the screen the same kind of ""closing in"" feeling that he brought to movies like ""Network"". In the end, the issue is not whether the defendant is innocent or guilty; the important point is the process by which the jurors reached their decision. This may be THE perfect movie."
knutsenfam,"Aug 25, 2005",7/10,"I won't repeat the details of the plot as many comments above summarize the plot and even the 12 jurors in depth...Briefly, Fonda's character challenges the rest of the 12 man jury to take time to reexamine the evidence before they send a very young man to the mandatory death sentence.A fair challenge. Even tho the case (as one juror argues ) seem so ""open and shut"".Here, the best thing about the film (to me) is the use of logic. Why? As the 12 men examine each bit of proof, they discover several possible logical flaws or false assumptions. Sound too dry? Not the way it is presented.My criticism is that Fonda's character is just too perfect, too right and (for most of the movie) too free from perspiration, unlike the rest in that hot jury room.Fonda early questions some jurors as to whether there's any possibility for error. If he said ""It's possible"" one more time, I was going to scream. (I remember various evil characters getting off on slim technicalities...! ) But fortunately, his questioning leads others to question evidence and to find REAL doubt that the testimony, etc. is valid.Their use of logic to pick out the evidentiary flaws is fascinating. Thus, this is still an excellent movie worth watching!"
tedg,"Apr 26, 2001",N/A,"This film deserves to be on anyone's list of top films. My problem is that it is so perfect, so seamlessly polished, it is hard to appreciate the individual excellences.The acting is top notch. I believe that monologue acting is quite a bit simpler than real reactive ensemble acting. Most of what we see today is monologues pretending to be conversations. But in this film, we have utter mastery of throwing emotions. Once the air becomes filled with human essence, it is hard to not get soaked ourselves as the camera moves through the thick atmosphere. Yes, there are slight differences in how each actor projects (Fonda internally, Balsam completely on his skin...) but the ensemble presents one vision to the audience.The writing is snappy too. You can tell it was worked and worked and worried, going through several generations. It is easy to be mesmerized by this writing and acting, and miss the rare accomplishment of the camera-work. This camera is so fluid, you forget you are in one room. It moves from being a human observer, to being omniscient, to being a target. It is smart enough to seldom center on the element of most importance, so expands the field to all men.This is very hard. Very hard, to make the camera human. So much easier to do what we see today -- acknowledge the machinery and jigger with it. Do we have a filmmaker today who could do this?Ted's Evaluation -- 4 of 3: Every cineliterate person should experience this."
cyrus1991,"May 28, 2022",10/10,This is the best crime drama movie in the world.I enjoyed watching this movie.The message of this film is that others should not be judged too quickly.I recommend everyone to watch this movie.
misha-wilkin,"Mar 17, 2003",8/10,"The plot of12 Angry Men revolves around the murder trail of a Latino boy who is accused of killing his father. The conviction of the boy would mean a death sentence and the destiny of the boy's life is in the hands of twelve male jurors of ranging personalities. The case seems open and shut with a murder weapon and several witnesses to place the boy at the scene of the crime. For eleven of the jurors the decision is apparent that the boy is guilty but for one juror, Mr. Davis (Henry Fonda), the boy's life should entail some discussion to eliminate any reasonable doubt the jurors may have. As the film progresses the personalities of the jurors become apparent and many underlying issues influence the guilty decision chosen by the majority of the jurors.The underlying issues are the complexity of the personalities of the jurors and the reasons why they have the motivation to feel and act the way they do. As the case unfolds further, more is learned about each juror individually. The personalities range from being a short-tempered loud mouth to a straight- laced accountant who never breaks a sweat. As the movie progresses much more is learned of the characters that exposes the intricacy of human nature and people's different personality traits.This film is an excellent example of movie making that does not require elaborate sets to entertain the viewer. The majority of the film takes place in a jury room with the men never leaving the room from their deliberation responsibilities. The cast and dialogue make this film memorable and the film has some clear moral issues that are addressed. The main issue is that not everything is as it seems. With further analysis the understanding of a situation becomes more concrete enabling the men to make a solid decision that affects a young man's life. 12 Angry Men is a classic film that should not be missed."
kosmasp,"Oct 21, 2019",10/10,"I could go on, but I thought I'd stop there before my summary line gets too big. Now just because this is a classic movie (and we really should try to use that term lightly, but this movie really deserves it and I'll elaborate on that), does not mean everybody will love it. And if one does not like it, it does not mean they have no taste. They just have different tastes, which is a good thing, because if every human on earth would have the same taste, life would be very boring now wouldn't it? The asnwer is yes, in case you were wondering.But back to this, which begins outside and takes us inside. And it is important that we were outside because we will live inside a building (a room to be more specific) for the most time. There is also a brief shot of the alleged culprit/criminal. After that we get in a room with 12 men, who are quite different from each other. And while it wasn't yet time to give African American a chance in a movie like that (or Asian American for that matter), there is a critical racial line that is drawn. If you follow what is happening and who says what or argues in certain ways, you will see that this movie has quite the social commentary in it.Now that is one part of this being genius, because it never rubs your nose in it. It never says, this guy who is i.e. from Italian descent has a reasonable thing/argument to say. No you just hear the things and see the people interact. And I have not even mentioned the way the movie is shot. And I'm not talking about the black and white cinematography (which is beautifully lit), no. I mean the framing and the set-ups. the editing and how everything flows. You feel like you're inside the room. You feel like this really happens or happened. Even the things that seem not staged (someone blocking another person, a shadow, peoples back and more) are in fact staged and masterfully done so.There are way smarter people than me, that can list you many things this movie has done right and I'm sure there quite a few sources online to look for. Just listening to the audio commentary can give a small glimpse into certain things too. But again, since this is not something that one might call light entertaining, if it does not appeal to you, then it is so. It does not mean you are wrong and it surely does not mean that this movie is falsely considered a masterpiece!"
thomasgouldsbrough,"Mar 8, 2022",10/10,"12 Angry Men may be the greatest film of the 1950's. It really is unlike other films, as it's takes place in mostly 1 location, over an hour and a half, and there's no actions - just a conversation. The acting just feels so natural, almost like they improvised the entire film. All the characters are distinct, and very memorable, especially juror 8.Ultimately, the film is all about influencing a group, and how everything at face value shouldn't be taken for fact. Juror number 8, despite talking the least, has the most influence over the group. Everything that seems a fact, the eyewitness seeing the kid through the passing El train, can be rexamined, and twisted. The film shows the jurors to be tribalistic, and how some of the jurors' mostly strongly held beliefs are also their least challenged. A fascinating film."
Xarx117,"Jul 1, 2022",10/10,"This movie is a very good example of what a good director can do with so little. Just the fact that everything happens in the same room is impressive. The details of the crime is only discussed, but it seems even more intterresting than if we would of actually seen it on screen. The characters are all played very well, the dialogue is pretty good and the camera work is also really impressive for its time! Everything combined, this movie is simple but very good."
gepoas,"Feb 2, 2020",10/10,"One of the best movies every made. This movie has one of the deepest stories, and best of all no violence. You are just taken on the journey, along with the jury to figure out what really happened, and ponder on the philosophical questions of accidentally imprisoning an innocent man."
Tony-Kiss-Castillo,"Feb 25, 2022",10/10,"This film is my submission as the greatest ensemble cast performance in the HISTORY of CINEMA! As it was released when I was only 9 years old.... I have viewed it on multiple occasions... But to be honest, I cannot remember exactly when I saw it for the first time!I must admit that the intricacies of jury duty selection in the New York area in the 1950's is something of which I know absolutely nothing about.... But I have often wondered if women, for some reason, were exempt from jury duty in New York 65 years ago!?!?!?Leaving that issue aside, let's focus on the film itself. Some of the actors in the cast, like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb and Ed Begley, were already well known when it was released in 1957. For Most of the others, their participation in this Classic certainly augmented their stature greatly! Although 12 ANGRY MEN was Nominated for Best Picture, Best Director and Best Adapted Screenplay, This Number 6 Highest Rated Movie of ALL-TIME, sadly, struck out at the Oscars... Winning nary a single Golden Statuette! I invite any and all of You reading my Review to focus on each and every astounding characterization rendered in this movie. With each viewing, I have come to appreciate and savor every detail, of every performance, all the more!As someone who has seen thousands of movies, 12 ANGRY MEN lets You totally get into the head of each and every character... As almost no other film, before or since! 12, layer by layer, methodically peels away the facade that is part and parcel of our subconcious self-protection and insulation from letting ourselves become too vulnerable and over-exposed to scrutiny by others!If You have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN... for whatever reason... or reasonS... You must place it at the very TOP of Your WATCH LIST! If perhaps, You saw it once, twice...or even three time, many years ago... I beseech You to revisit it! I am absolutely certain that You will thank yourself handsomely for doing so!"
AGman,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"Sidney Lumet's first film is one of his best. Of course, it helps to have people like Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, and Ed Begley. It's great because you never know the names of the any of the jurors until the end. When you see this one, watch for the opening shot. It continues for I don't know how long. Its amazing how you are kept glued to the screen throughout, despite the fact that they never leave the juror room and they continue talking and talking. Yet, it fascinates you. At the beginning, you don't know a thing about the case. In the end you  know every little detail. It may bore some, but I sure liked it."
FrenchEddieFelson,"Feb 25, 2019",N/A,"I saw this movie 3 or 4 times, and each time, I remain speechless in front of such a masterpiece. An unforgettable acting game with poignant plot twists. Awesome!"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 15, 2023",10/10,"Eleven to one, there is one enter dissenter among the Jury in the trial of a young man who's accused of murdering his father.This for me is one of the greatest films of all time, it somehow never suffers as the years go past. Twelve men from different backgrounds, with different view points come together, their mission, to determine the guilt of one young man, it's an amiable start, but soon tempers begin to fly as the status quo is questioned.I love that we're in for the kill as it were, we see no crime, or anything associated, everything we get is given to us by The Jurors, it is an incredible way of telling the story, I can't think of any other film that took this unique approach,It scrutinises the many weaknesses people have, prejudices, preconceived ideas, anger and personal grievance, but it's balanced out by showing the exact opposite, bravery, faith, intelligence, the ability to listen and question. This film ranks as one of the best studies of human nature in existence.If you've done jury service you'll relate to it, you have people that want to question, and you have people that want to get out of there and on with their lives as quickly as possible.It's incredible to think of a time when Juries consisted of twelve whits men, it would have taken a brave man to be a single disagreeing voice.I won't highlight a single performance, each is as remarkable as the next.10/10."
skinnercolin221,"Oct 16, 2022",10/10,"This movie is *not* a courtroom (or jury room) drama. It's about how a jury room can become a sanctuary that changes the lives of the jurors. It heavily implies that any place could become a place of metamorphosis if we only dug deeper with each other regarding each other's thoughts and beliefs.What seems to be a closed case slowly unravels through deeper discussion. In the beginning, 11-1 is the vote in favor of guilty, a vote to send an 18 year old to the electric chair for murdering his father. One juror thinks there should be more discussion. He stands up to a lot of ridicule, but perseveres and slowly has his doubts vindicated as more jurors notice fishy things about the case and change their votes."

Then there is '12 Angry Men' , with the entire film shot in a single location, and becomes the most entertaining film I have seen in a very long time. This is a film which gets the best of critics to rate it 10/10. You will just admire it's every minute."
muzaddidmehrab,"Jun 10, 2022",10/10,"The movies from the 50s were all masterpiece. 12 Angry Men were one of them. Beautiful concept of creating this movie based on a single topic in a single room. This movie reflects the human psychology and social perspective of human life. Human behaviour and natural response to dynamic situation can clearly observed in this movie. We also saw how discussing a logical explanation of every fact can clearly change the course of action.At the end, this movie was very engaging and i actually learned something from this movie. Recommending this to every user."
Angelaclarissa,"Mar 12, 2022",10/10,"This movie came out of an era that I really loved, when ensemble acting was so strong. We had a whole group of character actors who really took seriously the smaller roles that they had. The direction by Sidney Lumet on this film is outstanding. To take the Henry Fonda character from the meek, inconsequential juror, simply putting forth a theory, to watching the other men slowly see his way of thinking, is subtlety at its best. Lee J. Cobb does his burn, done in by impatience and inconvenience. Pusing an agenda that fits only him. Underlying the entire plot is the defendant whom we never see but get to know through a slow, methodical, yet fascinating series of revelations. It's quiet, suspenseful, and human."
Intebat,"Jul 17, 2022",9/10,"I did not expect to be so glued to my screen for a duration of 90 minutes and just seeing 12 old men argue but boy i was wrong, even though it was set in a single room, it's shockingly entertaining, it felt like i was in the jury too."
blablablazhik,"Jul 18, 2022",10/10,"""12 Angry Men""
A chamber film about self-discovery.""They have twelve pieces of paper... Twelve chances to kill!"" - tagline and the only thing I knew about the film. And that's what I'd like to shoot!I love when the essence of the film sounds in the ""background"". We watch the jury deliberate on whether the boy is guilty of murdering his father, and we see each character's soul unfold. Based on emotions, thinking about the case by the words of his life problems, almost every character builds a monument of his character and breaks it into pieces. Juror 9's monologue about an old man who, at 79 years old, just wants to be heard, gets me every time. And with all prof. Deformation, I forget that I'm watching a movie.And if you watched the movie and are waiting for comments about the case itself, facts and evidence - I have nothing to say. Many people have already done it for me. I remembered only people who reveal the truth in themselves by spending an hour talking to strangers. And it is stronger than any multiverse."
Xstal,"Feb 8, 2022",9/10,"A room of jurors take their seats, deliberate; a young man's future on the line, his life at stake; twelve white middle aging men, show us time and time again, what diversity and difference helps negate.A lesson about bias and prejudice, as relevant today as it ever was."
ReelCheese,"Sep 28, 2006",9/10,"So simple yet so brilliant, 12 ANGRY MEN is not to be missed. It's the tale of the meticulous Mr. Davis, a juror not quite convinced of a murder suspect's guilt despite what appears to be overwhelming evidence. His questions gradually persuade his fellow jurors that things aren't always as open-and-shut as they might seem.One of the great all-time ensemble casts highlights 12 ANGRY MEN. Henry Fonda is superb as the hardcore skeptic... but then again, everyone is superb, from Joseph Sweeney as the eldest juror to E.G. Marshall as the no-nonsense Juror #4. Anytime a film set almost exclusively at a single cramped table in a single cramped room can spellbound the viewer, you know you've got first-rate actors. The clever, colorful dialog is a treat as well.Yet the strongest asset of 12 ANGRY MEN is the demands it makes of the viewer to think critically. Initially we are like most of the jurors, curious as to how Fonda can be so naive to think the young suspect may be innocent. But he gradually pulls us into his line of reasoning, challenging our assumptions and finding fault with the supposed facts. By the film's end, we're left wondering how we could have been so narrow-minded just 90 minutes earlier.As sharp as what's on screen is, 12 ANGRY MEN is equally smart for what it does not show. Many of today's filmgoers would demand flashback sequences to depict what the characters describe. They would want to get to know the accused killer so they could judge him for themselves. They would want more action, more pizazz, and changes of scenery. Yet it's precisely the film's refusal to do any of this that makes it work so well. The viewer is effectively the 13th juror with nothing but recollections of testimony to go on. Our imaginations are free to create a picture of the alleged murder, just as we would have to as part of the jury.12 ANGRY MEN is often cited as one of the greatest films ever. It's a verdict that is well deserved."
AlsExGal,"Feb 19, 2017",9/10,"... the main flaw being that everybody brings their own life experiences and history into the jury room with them, no matter how hard they try to be impartial.Here you have a trial of a young boy who supposedly stabbed his father to death. When the jurors go back to deliberate on the case, ALL but one lone man played with a quiet courage by Henry Fonda states guilty and the rest of the film is about trying to get them to his side. Quite an amazing movie if you ask me. Fonda's case is not that the boy is innocent, but that the threshold of reasonable doubt has not been reached. The trick in this film is that it never leaves the jury room. You have no idea of what the defendant, the prosecuting attorney, or the defense attorney were like other than retroactively through the words of the jurors.Writing this good just can't be ignored. Reginald Rose's screenplay is absolutely brilliant. Not only are the characters of twelve individuals indelibly implanted in your brain within the limited time span of about 100 minutes, but Rose accomplishes this feat without undue speechifying or pontificating about injustice or the failures of the jury system or expositional dialogue. The characters personalities come out in the course of the film and are not ""set up"" in the first half hour, (as in having the jurors explain to each other what their occupations and backgrounds are) as is the case with mediocre screenplays. As for the acting it is true ensemble greatness. All twelve cast members are excellent, although if you put a gun to my head and forced me to say who was best I'd express a partiality for Lee J Cobb as the toughest nut to crack for acquittal and E. G. Marshall as a juror who is all logic and no emotion other than arrogance. And Sidney Lumet's first film just may be his most fast paced. The hundred minutes whiz by! Not a dull stretch to be seen anywhere.And yes, these are twelve white men judging a Puerto Rican boy, and yes Henry Fonda violated many classic rules of jury behavior when he introduced items into the discussion that were not official evidence, but this was 60 years ago and it IS a movie. So just suspend your beliefs and try to enjoy the art of the thing -the riveting dialogue, the character studies that don't choke each other out, and the brilliant camera-work that manages to make the room seem increasingly smaller so that you can appreciate the claustrophobia that must be setting in with the jurors as deliberations wear on and get more heated."
IonicBreezeMachine,"Apr 9, 2022",10/10,"Twelve jurors deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. While 11 Jurors are immediately in favor of a ""guilty"" verdict with Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb) the loudest supporter, one juror, Juror #8 (Henry Fonda), stands as the lone ""Not Guilty"" verdict and feels they should discuss the case rather than immediately render a verdict. As deliberations commence in the sweltering jury room during a heat wave positions and assumptions are challenged as jurors find their pre-conceived notions and personal prejudices challenged by new lights shone on the facts, witnesses and evidence.12 Angry Men is an adaptation of the 1954 television play Twelve Angry Men written by Reginald Rose for anthology series Studio One. The success of the teleplay resulted in stage adaptations, which in turn lead to a theatrical adaptation in 1957 produced by Henry Fonda. The movie also became the directorial debut of Sidney Lumet who had done TV work for both Studio One and The Alcoa Hour. While the movie received critical acclaim including Academy Award nominations for Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Adapted Screenplay, the movie was a box office disappointment in the US (but did better internationally) due to the advent of color and widescreen productions and it wouldn't be until television airings the film would find an audience. 12 Angry Men has ingrained itself in pop culture with all manner of references, allusions, and parodies of the work still being made to this day as well as re-adaptations both domestically and abroad. Rightly so, because while 12 Angry Men's premise is very simple, it's filled with all manner of complex characters we get to know over the course of its 90 minute runtime.The movie is essentially a chamber piece. Aside from scenes at the opening and closing of the movie, once we're in that jury room with our collection of actors featuring E. G. Marshall, Martin Baslam, and John Fiedler just to name a few we don't leave and the actors all give weight and presence to their characters so we feel like we get to know their personalities and histories and they play well off each other as tensions escalate. The movie takes a detached view of the murder case with most of the elements conveyed to us from second hand recounts of eyewitness statements leaving the audience very much in the position of determining whether or not the accused is in fact guilty with the same unreliable evidence.12 Angry Men remains a solid chamber drama with great performances from its ensemble and timeless themes. Henry Fonda gives a great performance, but it wouldn't stand out as much without the great assortment of other actors he plays off of. It's a classic for a reason."
zebra782,"Feb 3, 2008",10/10,"And that what I did, I friend of mine has been annoying me about seeing this film and since the film is not a long one (about 90 minutes) I said why not, and then after just 30 minutes I decided to put this film on the very top of my all time favorite film list.The fact that the film has been shot in one room blew my mind away, seems very easy to direct huh? But with a superb script and acting Sidney Lumet created one of the greatest films ever made if not the greatest.The dialogue is realistic and so sharp with a brilliant acting from Henry Fonda and Lee J.Cobb, I feel this film is still underrated even in IMDb rankings.And that line ""well, so long"" stayed with me ever since I saw the film as on of the greatest lines ever.This film is a symbol of simple but great film-making that suggests a man should always return to his senses every time and every where.10/10"
igornveiga,"May 1, 2019",10/10,"It makes us think, and question, about judging people before having the evidence of prosecution, even old the film is quite captivating and manages to entertain quite, unfortunately did not win Oscar but without doubt a great film."
jmverville,"Oct 20, 2004",7/10,"12 Angry Men is a terrific film that reflects a lot of the past problems and the proposed solutions of immigration, youth violence, and of course, overcoming one's own background and discrimination. The film surprised me in how progressive it was, and the ending social conclusions that it reached.In the film you can see clearly form a rift between the upper class, conservatives who are unwilling to change and the progressives who are proposing change for the better of all of us; this film, deep down, is a very class conscious and socially conscious film about discrimination and the deep lines it had in American society in 1957.Although the film's portrayal is sometimes overly simplistic, drawing a ""stubborn, pig-headed"" conservative versus ""righteous, just"" progressive, one can find that this was very much so a necessary film for its' time. In many ways, it is a work that was socially far advanced.Also what is interesting is the fact that it is a film that is done with great simplicity; some actors, and a room... It relies greatly upon the pure talent of the actors, and the great direction of Sidney Lumet -- this film is truly unique due to the true minimalism it embraces in its' production tactics, yet this is something that could easily go unnoticed due to the incredible quality of the film."
RoundTripTicket,"May 21, 2023",4/10,"I'm going to be contrary. The movie is about as preachy as you can get. The 12 jurors are all cartoonish stereotypes, locked into their predictable characters. The unlikeable characters, of course, all make vacuous, absurd arguments for there position, while yelling and gesticulating. The characters we're supposed to like all make calm, reasonable arguments.The morality is laid out in stark black and white. No grey, no ambiguity, no difficult choices. Me, I like a movie with a dilemma, and some ""lesser of two evils"" choices. Each character should also be a mixture of good and bad and grey.Don't you get tired of Hollywood clonking you over the head with a moral lesson? Especially when Hollywood isn't any better than the rest of us."
ElMaruecan82,"Mar 14, 2011",10/10,"Juror #1, the foreman (Martin Balsam, football coach): ""Well, I won't be too technical, or make a long speech  it's just that it's a one-set film, so it's new and risky, because you know, dialogs are not enough, we need uh  the thrills  and it goes slowly in the beginning but progressively, it's like the jury room becomes smaller, and the faces bigger. I really felt the tense and suffocating atmosphere ... And what an explosive climax, I could hardly breathe  I know it's strange, but the direction, well, the movie is one hell of a thriller  I, well, my verdict is clear: GREAT MOVIE""Juror #2 (John Fiedler, bank clerk): ""I don't know. It's an excellent film, served by great performances. Every character was convincing, so were their interactions. I can't find any flaw, for me, there's nothing to add, and nothing to remove. It is a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #3 (Lee J. Cobb, businessman): ""I told you why this movie is great, it's just  thought provoking, everything and I mean everything looked like it would have been this kind of preachy film with a good-hearted hero and simple-minded antagonists who just want to be vindictive. But this is an intelligent film which, even at the end, makes you question if the kid is guilty or not. Because it has nothing to do with punishment, it's about justice ... without any prejudice, and that deserves respect, yes sir! No doubt for me  GREAT MOVIE""Juror #4 (E.G. Marshall, stockbroker): ""First of all, it's an excellent examination of all the subtle nuances that enrich a male adult demography, played with such believability every one could identify with one of the jurors. Secondly, the writing was intellectually gripping and emotionally engaging and I would add: respectful of the viewer's intelligence. The direction was excellent and created a feeling of growing claustrophobia guided by a very clever use of focal lenses, a credit to Sidney Lumet. Last but not least, it's about the noble concept of justice and presumption of innocence: ""12 Angry Men"" delivers a brilliant, intelligent, and universally inspiring message. To conclude, I can say I had the privilege to watch a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #5 (Jack Klugman, the man from the slum): ""What else to say? I second the idea that it's a powerful drama demonstrating how prejudices poison the heart of our civilization, and I believe this is one of the few films that should be screened everywhere in the world as a powerful lesson for tolerance. My verdict is: GREAT MOVIE""Juror #6 (Edward Binns, painter): ""A movie that younger and future generations should watch and respect. These are movies with no special effects, no big-star cast, no big explosions, no flashy cars and no sexy girls. You have a honest, simple movie featuring ordinary men, but the result is so impacting it should be appreciated by any movie lover, regardless of his or her age. Anyway, GREAT MOVIE""Juror #7 (Jack Warden, salesman): ""Come on, everyone is using big words and noble concepts, but for me, this movie is just damn entertaining. Hey admit it, the dialogs, the way opposite characters interact, create a lot of anxiety but is also very fun to watch, sometimes, well  I think you can say anything, but without entertainment, a film is worthless, and the movie could've been a bore, just all talk and no walk, but it wasn't, it worked for me ... GREAT MOVIE""Juror #8 (Henry Fonda, architect): ""This movie invites us to explore our convictions and question the way they influence our judgments. Justice is done by men, blindly and implacably, this is why punishment must be beyond any doubt, and when you have what appears to be an open-and-shut case that progressively reveals some flaws as we go deeper in the subject, well, this says a lot about the negative impact of subjectivity when it comes to justice, and how we should be careful about the consequences of our thoughts, our words, our acts. ""12 Angry Men"" is a humanistic inspiration for those who have faith in justice. GREAT MOVIE""Juror #9 (Joseph Sweeney, retired): ""This is a fantastic character study illustrating how convincingness is often driven by the personality. It's an incredible illustration of the way a few people can monopolize the talk and how a silent majority is eager to follow the ones who aggressively express their thoughts, and the courage it takes to be the lone dissenter and how using a constructive, polite and logical answer can destroy something taken for granted. While watching ""12 Angry Men"" I understood that a consensus, when rapidly built, means that the truth must be elsewhere. And one truth for sure, this is a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #10 (Ed Begley, garage owner): ""I hate the patronizing way some left-wing good-hearted people adore this film, this has nothing to do with politics, truth or justice, it's about manipulation of your thoughts by pushing the right emotional button  you missed the point, and that's the beauty of the film, you're all easily fooled. Not for the reasons you think, but it's a GREAT MOVIE""Juror #11 (Joseph Voskovek, watchmaker): ""No need to be American to appreciate the beauty of this film, it's about our deepest convictions. It's about the humanistic concept of reasonable doubt which can save even a guilty soul ... because life is valuable and justice is not vengeance. GREAT MOVIE""Juror #12 (Robert Webber, advertising executive): ""Wow, what I can say, it's not an exact science you know  you can find a reason A to appreciate it, a reason B or C  let's just say that the 'sigma' of these reasons, explains why it's an incredible film and as my fellow jurors said, why ""12 Angry Men"" is a GREAT MOVIE"""
HammBurger,"May 20, 2025",10/10,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a B&W classic. An American legal drama film directed by: Sidney Lumet in his feature directorial debut (well done Sidney).An all-star cast: With Martin Balsam (Juror 1, the chair), John Fiedler (Juror 2), Lee J. Cobb (Juror 3), E. G. Marshall (Juror 4), Jack Klugman (Juror 5), Edward Binns (Juror 6), Jack Warden (Juror 7), Henry Fonda (Juror 8, the doubter), Joseph Sweeney (Juror 9), Ed Begley (Juror 10), George Voskovec (Juror 11), Robert Webber (Juror 12)
I love that for the bulk of the movie, the setting is the jurors room. Save for the very beginning and at the very end.The story played out was done very well. With some back and forth between the players on the screen, I'd say the 90min. Run time went by very fast.With Hollywood seemingly running out of ideas, and simply doing remake after remake. I'd hope they will keep their hands off this film. Its perfect the way it is, thank you.A B&W classic that you'll enjoy too."

chiragrathod09,"Jul 17, 2024",10/10,"""12 Angry Men,"" directed by Sidney Lumet and released in 1957, is a timeless courtroom drama that transcends its genre to explore profound themes of justice, prejudice, and the moral responsibilities of a jury. Set almost entirely within a single room, the film unfolds as twelve jurors deliberate the fate of a young defendant accused of murder. What begins as a seemingly straightforward case quickly evolves into a gripping exploration of bias, doubt, and human integrity.The film's strength lies in its exceptional writing and directing. Reginald Rose's script masterfully navigates the intense dynamics within the jury, illuminating how personal experiences, emotions, and prejudices can cloud judgment. Each juror is richly characterized, with distinct personalities and backgrounds that shape their perspectives on the case.Henry Fonda, who plays Juror #8, stands out as the lone voice advocating for reasonable doubt. His performance is both poignant and resolute, embodying the ideal of justice through his unwavering commitment to truth. Fonda's character serves as a moral compass throughout the film, challenging the other jurors to confront their biases and reconsider the evidence presented.The ensemble cast features remarkable performances from actors like Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, and Jack Klugman, each bringing depth to their characters. As tensions rise and tempers flare, the claustrophobic setting of the jury room creates an atmosphere of palpable tension, expertly captured by Lumet's direction. The film's cinematography, with its clever use of close-ups and varying angles, enhances the emotional stakes and keeps viewers engrossed.""12 Angry Men"" not only serves as a gripping narrative but also acts as a profound social commentary. The film highlights the fragility of the justice system and the importance of civic duty. It poses critical questions regarding the nature of guilt and innocence, the impact of socio-economic backgrounds, and the significance of empathy in decision-making.Despite being over six decades old, ""12 Angry Men"" remains remarkably relevant, as the issues it tackles-prejudice, accountability, and the morality of judgment-continue to resonate in contemporary society. It invites audiences to engage in introspection while examining their own biases and the importance of standing up for what is right.""12 Angry Men"" is a cinematic masterpiece that combines brilliant writing, stellar performances, and a compelling narrative to create a thought-provoking experience. Its exploration of justice and human nature is as relevant today as it was at its release, making it a must-see film for anyone interested in the complexities of morality and the ethical dilemmas faced within the justice system.Best courtroom drama film ever made 10/10."
yaaraveyofficial,"Aug 1, 2022",10/10,"A film that just gets better with every watch!12 Angry Men is a classic that I was introduced to as ""an unforgettable experience"". Having watched it 10+ times, I now agree.A 'must watch' for movie enthusiasts who love to see realism in written characters and read between the lines of their dialogues."
brierleyaj,"May 14, 2022",10/10,"12 Angry Men leads the viewer on a introspective journey, whilst thoroughly entertaining with the use of subtle suspense, keeping the viewer truly engaged. With the use of powerful theatrical techniques to enrich it's characters, it evokes the raw vigour and vivacity of real life emotion and mannerisms. In Angry Men, the jury becomes a microcosm for a male-dominated society on the precipice, stretching the moral limits of American democracy in a tense tussle between hope and ignorance. A truly American film."
pilothouseman,"Jul 11, 2007",6/10,"The best thing about this movie was watching the classic Hollywood and TV actors. The writing was good and is seldom found in movies today. Apart from that the film was nothing special.After 20 minutes I could already see the end of the movie. Also I thought it a stretch that Henry Fonda's character could be so persuasive simply by standing his ground and saying 'maybe he's guilty and maybe he isn't.'Perhaps its high IMDb rating is because a lot of people agree with the moral message it preaches. Maybe the moral message is 10 star but the movie is not. If you want to see a really good, classic, one scene, character study movie, check out Hitchcock's ""Lifeboat""."
bob the moo,"Apr 27, 2008",N/A,"A young ethnic kid from a rough area is up on a murder charge and to the jury of twelve men, it all seems a fairly open and shut case. So all are surprised when the votes come back with one ""not guilty"" in the pack. Juror #8 maintains he holds a reasonable doubt, much to the frustration of the rest of the group. The stalemate forces a debate over the details of the case which sees each man questioning others and themselves for their motivations and decisions. The heat in the room and the passage of time sees tensions rising by the minute.I'm not a massive fan of the ""Movie You Must See"" podcast crew because they mostly tend to discuss the events in a film rather than really critiquing or reviewing it (although at times this ""mates in a pub"" approach is OK). Anyway, one of the advantages of having anyone pointing out ""films you should see"" is that it reminds you that you should these films. So it was for me as I listened to 12 Angry Men and realised that not only had I never reviewed it but that I had not actually watched it for many years. Of course mentally I knew it was a ""classic"" but did I really understand why it was? So when it came on television recently I watched it again with new eyes.The films moves right into the jury room and pretty much this room is all we have for the duration. Initially the script does really well to have the viewer side with the majority because in the discussions the evidence does seem very clear cut and #8's doubts seem so general and non-specific. This is a good way to start because it means the viewer also has to question and we are taken along the journey just like the men in the jury. Gradually we get into the detail and doubts are tweaked out  not to the point of solving the crime because that is not what it is about but it is done in a way that is interesting and engaging. It is not perfect in this regards though because some of the jumps are big, some of the assumptions are stretching and some of the knowledge in the room is a little too convenient. However what weaknesses there are in the material are covered by the fact that the delivery is roundly quite brilliant.Lumet directions from within the room and makes great use of such a small space. It feels like it could be a play (not sure if it was or not) but Lumet prevents this just feeling like filmed theatre. The camera captures the room, sticks close to characters, moves around, in and out accordingly and it never feels stiff. This aids the sense of tension from the audience point of view as we are not just left watching the room so much as being in it. The ensemble cast are another big factor in this delivery as they all deliver. On the surface of it the characters could easily be labelled ""racist"", ""old"", ""naïve"", ""angry"" and so on but the actors don't let themselves be that basic and they also do a good job of pacing the building resentment and tension in the room to be convincing. Fonda maybe has ""top-billing"" but he does have the least showy role, leading those into his corner. Cobb and Begley have good turns as the anger of the room but everyone plays their parts very well. OK Balsam, Webber and Voskovec come out the least memorable of the lot but this is understandable when viewed beside such sterling turns from Fielder, Klugman, Warden, Sweeney and Marshall. There really isn't a weak link in the room.With modern cynical eyes it is perhaps totally hard to accept the film for its praise of the jury system and I do agree with the ""MYMS"" group when they made reference to the moment in H:LOTS which is essentially the bitter reverse of this film. However this slightly flag-waving stuff is covered by the delivery being as strong and as well paced as it is. Overall then this is an eminently watchable film and I can understand why it is so well regarded. The material and message may not be note-perfect but the delivery is brilliant across the board and it is one that I could easily return to again and again and still get pleasure out of how well it is all done."

This movie not only tells a very good story on paper, but also the camera that tells its own story being accompanied by the play of the actors, which is again perfect. So we have a flawless story, a 10 out of 10 cinematografy and one of the best performances I've ever seen, it's impossible not to say that 12 angry old men is one of the best movies ever made."
wwc-johnb,"Feb 23, 2008",7/10,"Henry Fonda is the star here, but the other roles are filled by legendary character actors. To see Lee Cobb, Jack Klugman, Jack Warden, and Ed Begley all doing there thing at the same time is a joy. My main problem with the movie is that it is soooo preachy. The scene is painted in black and white, there are few shades of gray. Most of the character are stereotypes-- ie, the bigot, the bully, the nerd, the immigrant, the glad-handing but uncaring salesman, etc. It is a tribute to the fine actors that they bring such one-dimensional characters to life. And shining through it all is the oh so good man who has right, justice, and the American way on his side. The self-righteousness is a bit cloying, and I almost expect Fonda to have a halo over his head. That being said, it is enjoyable for the acting and a must see for those who have missed it so far."
tonosov-51238,"Aug 15, 2022",8/10,"This is an amazing film, and what people usually fail to realize is that this is Lumet's feature debut. An incredible start to the career of one of the best directors in the industry."

Even though I know the outcome, it is interesting to speculate about the message each juror is trying to express.Of course, just about all of Henry Fonda's performances are exceptional, and in this one, you see him sweat. The real tension in this movie is the interaction between the jurors. Even though you mostly focus on Henry Fonda and Lee J. Cobb, there is not a wasted juror, as you can see from the cast list.There are several similar movies, including a remake,12 Angry Men (1997); however, this classic is the rod by which all others are measured."

Thank you Sidney Lumet for such a fantastic film. He gave us the likes of other cinematic phenomena such as 'Serpico' (1973), and 'Dog Day Afternoon' (1975) which are also just as striking as '12 Angry Men', both essential viewings.

vvejesus,"Dec 26, 2016",10/10,"When I found this movie in the ""Top 250"" in such a high position, i was quite surprised, especially when I realized that 90% of the movie happens in a room, and that's a risk, Because you need the characters to be quite flashy and that the script that is delivered has to be very entertaining not to be bored, and it goes that this movie does not bore you, it keeps you intrigued by the case that is, the juries are very Outstanding, I will not do a long review, it is only a recommendation of a person who doubted much of a movie of this style and was fascinated.(It is also an important fact to say that I am not a man very interested in crime issues, nor very knowledgeable about it.)The film deals with the case of a young man who is being blamed for murder and the jury must decide whether to give the maximum penalty or not. It is a plot that looks pretty simple, noting that this movie is based on a play from what I understand. What I called a lot of the movie is the atmosphere that you are given in the room, a hot day, 12 tired men and some of them want to leave as quickly as caring the sentence really. This film I liked also because it deals with quite interesting subjects: doubt, as our experience affects us in our decisions, go, subjects that look in perspective rather boring (Thinking of someone who only wants to watch a movie and not a moral debate) but that Are developed so well and subtly that you do not feel that you are giving a speech, you feel that you are watching a movie with interesting themes.I do not know what you could add in this review, is that it's so great, even if you do not like these spoken themes, I recommend it as a movie about thinking and entertainment at the same time."

Snow Leopard,"Sep 27, 2004",N/A,"The unsurpassed character studies of the ""12 Angry Men"" would almost make a movie worth seeing even if it had little else to offer. This is also a very good drama that uses everything it has to good advantage. The cast and director Sidney Lumet all do a fine job of sketching each character efficiently and memorably. Every character is important, and almost every line serves a purpose.One interesting thing about the story is that the trial per se is almost not even particularly important. The jury setting is really just a stylized way of high-lighting many aspects of human nature and human interaction, and in particular, the varied ways that different persons respond in situations where their options are limited. The characters have a wide and well-chosen diversity of personalities and opinions, and each one's temperament and attitudes are developed as things proceed.In performing this kind of material, it's important for the actors not to overdo it, or else the believability suffers. It's also a challenge to keep things interesting when the settings and props are so limited. But everything works very well here, and it is a credit to everyone involved."
I_Ailurophile,"May 6, 2022",10/10,"At risk of repeating myself a few words in, let's not bury the lede: '12 angry men' is one of the greatest movies that will ever be made.This film's reputation far precedes it, and it's taken me far too long to actually get around to watching it. It has far exceeded all possible expectations. The premise is so simple, and the plot is no more than a tracing of the jury's discussion, but those bare-bones elements are all that is necessary to produce a stunning, moving picture. Quintessential, paramount themes include and are not limited to prejudice and confirmation bias; redirected anger, ego, and inflated notions of masculinity; careful deliberation and critical thinking; reason, mob rule, and the former prevailing over the latter; loud mouths, empty heads, and hot tempers; presumption of innocence, the dire importance of ""doubt,"" due process, democracy, justice - and still more. It's a picture that is at times infuriating, sad, inspiring, or thought-provoking, and lively and stimulating at all points, while nonetheless spending 97% of its length within a single room. For all the rightly acclaimed features that have ever been made, precious few immediately make so staggering and lasting an impact as this. '12 angry men' is truly perfect.The dialogue and scene writing in Reginald Rose's screenplay is ""everything,"" as the youths say. Even within a singular space these manage to be rich, vibrant, and dynamic, carrying a dazzling array of ideas, moods, and flavors. Though of a completely different genre, only one other picture (Tilman Singer's 2018 indie horror flick 'Luz') readily comes to mind as having achieved anything like the same effect of communicating a cohesive, whole narrative without actively filming that which is being described. It's the screenwriting equivalent of an ice cream cone that simultaneously embodies one's every favorite flavor, even those that ordinarily conflict and weren't scooped. The progression of the jurors' heated conversation is a stroke of brilliance, twisting and shifting with fiery passion and steadfast willfulness that roundly impresses. Just as notable is that '12 angry men' declines additional amplifying embellishments (e.g. A reveal that a juror is on the take) as we would expect of most courtroom dramas: this is the story of twelve men honoring their ""civil responsibility,"" and nothing more. And that is most assuredly all it needs to be.Rose's characters represent a noteworthy (if entirely white and male) diversity of backgrounds, values, beliefs, and preconceptions. One could only imagine the fireworks that may ensue from a 21st century remake that reflects genuine, realistic diversity, but still this 50s rendition is enough without it. There is depth and complexity to each of the jurors that is wonderfully gratifying as a viewer - and the cast is utterly extraordinary in breathing life into them all. With character comportment ranging from calm and collected, to brash and volatile, and everything in between, every actor on hand is given stupendous opportunity to illustrate their skill, and they definitely do. Each individual performance is just magnificent as anything else in '12 angry men,' and marked with exquisite range, nuance, strength and force of personality, and physicality that turns one sweltering room into a blast furnace of deeply absorbing drama. I could name the actors one by one, but it's just as easy to scroll through the cast list - from one to the next, they are tremendous.It would be very easy to speak at greater length about the resounding triumph of cinema '12 angry men' is, but there would come a point where one only talking in circles. Suffice to say that it's near-universal acclaim and high regard is absolutely deserved; I feel like a fool for having taken so long to ever watch it, and for the mere thought that it wouldn't hold up. Sixty-five years later this remains a masterful drama that demands to be seen wherever you may have the opportunity."

Sebastian_Conrad,"May 15, 2016",9/10,"12 Angry Men is a 1957 American drama film with elements of film noir, adapted from a teleplay of the same name by Reginald Rose. Written and co-produced by Rose himself and directed by Sidney Lumet, this trial film tells the story of a jury made up of 12 men as they deliberate the guilt or acquittal of a defendant on the basis of reasonable doubt. In the United States, a verdict in most criminal trials by jury must be unanimous. The film is notable for its almost exclusive use of one set: with the exception of the film's opening, which begins outside on the steps of the courthouse followed by the judge's final instructions to the jury before retiring, two short scenes in an adjoining washroom, and a brief final scene on the courthouse steps, the entire film takes place in the jury room. The total time spent outside the jury room is three minutes out of the full 96 minutes of the film.12 Angry Men explores many techniques of consensus-building, and the difficulties encountered in the process, among a group of men whose range of personalities adds intensity and conflict. No names are used in the film: the jury members are identified by number until two of them exchange names at the very end, the defendant is referred to as ""the boy"", and the witnesses as ""the old man"" and ""the lady across the street"".In 2007, 12 Angry Men was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being ""culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant"" and is often seen as one of the greatest films ever made."

I would very much like to own it on DVD soon.The movie is over 60 years old but it still holds up today because of the tight-knit set and simple story. Some of the performances are still unsurpassed in regards to most of the classic cinema I have seen.It is highly awarded/honored amongst the film society, and I recommend it to everyone because it is a classic and it has some of the most profound scenes you'll see from a movie even with little to no extreme action, gimmicks, etc.Just great acting, a simple but profound story, excellent directing, good suspense, and more...(10/10)"

massimilianofoschi,"Aug 9, 2022",9/10,"A lot has already been said about this masterpiece, thus it seems almost unnecessary to praise its many qualities. There two elements in particular, though, which set it apart from other classics.One is how it showcases the sheer power of good screenplay and acting. There's no need for special effects, stunning cinematography or forced plot twists to create an intelligent and extremely entertaining film. Director Sidney Lumet only needed one room, twelve good actors and a timeless issue. With twelve distinctive characters, there are endless possibilities for interaction between them: what would happen if an extremely rigorous man had to cooperate with someone who'd rather play tic-tac-toe? Or an old man who finds himself ignored by many with a young businessman who costantly talks about his job?The second aspect is how, despite being more than sixty years old, this movie's characters are incredibly relatable. Everyone has their biases, some are more emotional, some calmer, some more rigorous, some more chaotic. It is safe to say that we all now at least someone who resembles each of the twelve angry men. What is extraordinary is that this incredibly poignant characterisation is achieved with little more than an hour and a half for twelve distinct jurors, and all of them are memorable.If you want to experience the power of cinema, regardless of your age, gender and cultural upbringing, watch this - you won't regret it."
Rockwell_Cronenberg,"Feb 21, 2012",7/10,"What is there to be said that hasn't already been said? It's earned it's status as a classic for a reason. While I wouldn't go so far as to call it one of the greatest of all time, it is a vastly entertaining take on a brilliant premise that has been used throughout the decades sense. The dialogue is sharp, the character turns are believable and interesting and the whole thing flows along at a swift pace. When it was over I couldn't believe that so much time had gone by. I'm always fascinated by films that take place entirely in one location (or almost entirely) and this was one of the early precedents for the kind of greatness one can accomplish when that is utilized properly.The ominous surroundings like the heat and the storm add nice bits of tension to the rising tempers of the men in the room and the confrontations between the soft Henry Fonda and the explosive Lee J. Cobb were intense. Sidney Lumet is a man who earned his reputation as an ""actor's director"" and made his career out of mostly setting up the stage and aiding his actors in doing what they do best, but I think his stylistic choices here deserve to be commended. The way that he slowly brings the camera down over the course of the film, bringing us more intimately into the heart of this room, it adds that sense of claustrophobia that makes the tension even more gripping as we proceed into the later stages of it all.Practically everyone in the cast shines at one point or another, my favorites being the commanding Fonda who is able to be the voice of reason without being annoying, the pensive E.G. Marshall, the racist and volatile Ed Begley and the wise, determined Joseph Sweeney. The film had plenty of great twists, like the knife reveal, but my favorite scene had to be Begley going off on his offensive monologue while one-by-one the jurors turned away from him until he realized that his ignorance had caused him to lose any voice he once had; a powerfully real moment. I also loved the added touch of putting Fonda in an all white suit while everyone else was in shades of black or grey."
maryolalov,"Jan 17, 2019",8/10,There's not much that can be said about 12 Angry Men apart from it being a very well made movie. It is ture that its plot is nothing special and it seems very boring at first but as you get deeper and deeper you start to enjoy it. Because the thing that makes this movie good is not some awesome and unique plot but the impressive dialogues. I actually think that this movie is a bit overrated but I have to admit that it has one of the best dialogues. These marvelous dialogues are the thing that makes this movie the masterpiece it is.The acting is on an average level. The actors did a good job but I can't say that anyone of them did an outstanding performance. As for the cinematography it could've been better. I personally think that if they had shot this movie form different angles it would've looked more intriguing and intense. But still as I already said 12 Angry Men has a very well written script and that's enough for it to be called a good movie.
auuwws,"Mar 17, 2021",10/10,"The third best movie I saw in a live movie at all levels after the first ten minutes, the movie attracted me a lot, before I watched the movie I was afraid that the movie was without events and it was in one room, but I liked the movie I liked it very much, I liked most of the jurors, especially Juror No. Most of the actors played their roles excellently, they were not actors while I was watching the movie and the best actor in the movie was Lee J. Cobb. His performance was very impressive. The story of the movie, despite its simplicity but it was wonderful, made me wonder if the person is able to do justice or if he could not understand it, I would advise any cinema lover to watch the movie and my rating 9.6"
kevin_robbins,"Jun 2, 2022",8/10,"12 Angry Men (1957) is a movie I recently watched for the first time in a long time on Tubi. The storyline follows a jury trying a case for murder where everyone agrees but one person. That one person discusses the case with the jury and explains why he doesn't agree based on the evidence. Will the jurors change their mind and align with the man or will it be a hung jury?This movie is directed by Sidney Lumet (Before the Devil Know You're Dead) and stars Henry Fonda (The Wrong Man), Lee J. Cobb (On the Waterfront), Jack Warden (Heaven Can Wait), Edward Binns (Patton), Martin Balsam (Psycho) and E. G. Marshall (Creepshow).The storyline for this picture is very smart and unique. The acting and dialogue is out of this world and the storyline is well paced and unfolds well. The acting is splendid and Fonda and Cobb's back and forth is very good. There are many unpredictable elements. Some of the sequences felt unrealistic; but overall, it was still an entertaining watch.This movie isn't perfect but it is definitely worth a viewing. I would score this an 8/10 and strongly recommend it."

suburbannightmare,"Apr 7, 2009",10/10,"A pure, simple, undeniable classic. This movie is a thoughtful, well shot, amazingly scripted, fantastically acted masterpiece. Even though the word masterpiece is often over-used (like genius) it certainly, and without dispute applies in this case. Sidney Lumet's directing is top-notch, and Henry Fonda is the still turning point of this small, microcosmic little world - his role has to be one of the most finely acted ever committed to film.Set in an actual New York jury room, it's a claustrophobic, tightly confined set, where 12 very different men deliberate over the guilt of a young boy. Their prejudices, morals and personalities are thrown together and, sometimes violently, clash. Along with a great parallel commentary from the weather (at the beginning of the film, it's a stuffy, oppressive sweatbox, which becomes sidelined by a dark, stormy maelstrom outside the jury room) this is a fantastic film. You'd never think there were so many angles you could get from one single, uncomfortably confining room. Sidney Lumet's directing is amazing, as Fonda's chain-smkoing, softly spoken moralistic character could have been played so much darker; he manages to turn everyone around, slowly but surely, almost effortlessly converting even the most staunchly opposed and stoic juror - but he's not manipulative, sly or underhanded about it. He simply presents what is - he's the pure voice of reason, and he has some cracking lines. The other jurors are great, too. I'm sure we all know someone who fidgets through something important because they've got a football game starting in ten minutes - they all highlight broad generalisations of very human characters. I defy anyone not to find a character that illustrates someone they know in this motley crue. Except maybe Fonda - I don't know anyone cooler than this guy."
Theo Robertson,"Jan 9, 2003",10/10,"What a bloody stupid idea for a cinema film ! Adapt a teleplay set entirely in one studio bound location , written in real time with absolutely no cinema appeal whatsoever ! Me ? I wouldn`t have touched this script with a barge pole if I was a producer which just goes to show why - Only very very occasionally - some people deserve to be film producers while - Only very very occasionally - people like myself don`t . 12 ANGRY MEN is a masterpiece , maybe not in the way APOCALYPSE NOW or FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING are cinematic masterpieces , but it`s still a masterpiece of high dramaDespite being based on a play Lumet does bring some outstanding directorial flourishes to the film . Look at he scene where the camera cuts from one raised hand to another to an empty space that has a raised hand gingerly creeping into the frame , or the scene where the characters become more and more disgusted with Ed "" Know what I mean "" Begley`s reactionary diatribe . Please forgive Reginald Rose`s ever so slightly bleeding heart liberal subtext or a couple of unlikely occurances like the scene with the knife , or the fact that jury discussions are nothing like this in real life because even more thought went into this script as went into MEMENTO . This is a classic film and one of the few ones I`ve awarded 10 points toOne last point: If you have never seen 12 ANGRY MEN how on earth can you describe yourself as a film fan ?"
tonymontana_,"Dec 13, 2003",10/10,"In the days before cgi, massive hype, star-appeal, pseudo-mythic trilogies and all the other bumpf that hollywood tacks on to its product in order to make it sell, all it took to make a decent movie was to have a good script and cast, good direction and of course great acting.These were (and still are) the only real ingredients which I'd say are essential for making a truly worthwhile movie. Everything else is just a sideshow, and I think it is a shame that so many of today's mainstream films are so flimsy. And that's why I love the classics!"
kod502,"Feb 11, 2011",10/10,"I saw this film for the first time a few months ago and i was automatically annoyed with myself for having not done so long before. To put short, this film is one of the best ever made and rightfully deserves its position on IMDBs top 250 list.To be honest, there's not a lot that one can comment about the film. There are no special effects, dramatic monologues or defining scenes to discuss and really that's what makes this film the phenomenon that it is. It is quite easy to see where the film is going to go and how it is going to end early on but none of that really matters because excuse the sugary metaphor but it is the journey you embark on with the jurors, in particular Henry Fonda, that defines the film. The way in which each different aspect of the court case is re-evaluated is film heaven but also a hard hitter when reflecting on the seriousness that the film makes about judicial systems and the responsibility of juries to make thorough rational decisions.If you had told me before the film that it was as near as makes no difference one scene with 12 men conversing for 100 minutes (or whatever), i would have kindly asked you if we could watch Die Hard instead, but oh what an ignorant error that would have been. 12 Angry Men is magnificent."
trminator-35198,"Jan 17, 2019",7/10,A little slow at the beginning but the viewer soon realizes that was the intention. This movie had acting that didn't feel far from accurate and a script that was mentally stimulating. A good movie and a decent run time.
Quinoa1984,"Mar 6, 2006",10/10,"It's tough sometimes to translate a stage production- which 12 Angry Men essentially is- into a feature film, with in this case one cramped room and a dozen characters with totally varied ideals. In a way this is like the textbook example, however, of how to do a film like this. You see how the situation unfolds into something more, about the act of telling a story and finding all the pieces. That it has such a powerhouse of an ensemble doesn't hurt it at all, and the little surprises in how the casts acts and reacts works great on repeat viewings. The basic premise only needs brief mention, as the 12 men (totally angry may be disputed by some, though I'm sure not one is left without raising their voice), all white, are judging the case of a Hispanic charged with killing his father. The deliberation room becomes a kind of boiler room where Henry Fonda's juror #11, the only un-sure one, sets the stage for a something more to be revealed- human nature when on a judgment day, with all its intelligence, ignorance, hate, and seeking objectivism.Sidney Lumet, on his very first feature-film, does a really professional (in a good way) job of directing the picture, by which a) letting the actors, who among the great lot include Lee J Cobb, John Fiedler, E.G. Marhall, Martin Balsam, Jack Klugman, Ed Begley, and in maybe the most under-rated role of the 'old man', Joseph Sweeney, just do their work and try to just make sure no one over-steps their ability in their strengths; b) using the atmosphere to high effect. Like he would later do with Network, Lumet uses the camera to add some level of subjectivity to the storytelling, being careful with choosing close-ups but using them very wisely (i.e. a surprise close-up on Sweeney), and here and there making it feel like the walls are just closing in a little more. But, at the same time, Lumet's making a studio picture, with the all-around good-guy Henry Fonda (in one of his best roles), and dealing with a story that's, when it comes down to it, just the details of a crime examined over. But the real strength of the film comes in a quality that it shares with Rashomon (different in structure to be sure), that the idea of looking for the truth is just a guise in a way to examine the people who are looking at what the truth is. It's a nifty movie that has deservedly stayed firm through the decades, not showing its age bad at all."
hans-daba,"Apr 8, 2014",9/10,"12 Angry Men is as simple as it is profound, and as bare-boned as it is a showcase of true camera-work and directional complexity. It is as much a film about the justice system in America as it is a film about people; a film that lets the viewer into a single room for 90 minutes (the film moves forward quicker than real time) and examines the quirks, insecurities, prejudices and glaring background differences of twelve different characters.The film begins in a courtroom as a murder case is coming to a close. The judge informs the twelve jurors of their duty as though it were just another day in his life, as though the defendant (an 18-year old street kid) has already been proved guilty. In general, nobody in the film expects the potential (and probable) difficulties that the viewer anticipates externally. It is an ""open and shut case"" as the remarkable, unnamed juror (played by Lee J. Cobb) states in the first ten minutes.Of course it isn't, otherwise 12 Angry Men would be an ""open-and-shut"" film. Opening credits play over an empty room which gradually fills up as the jurors takes their seats and prepare for the ballot. Over this time, we see windows being opened, negotiations taking place and pleasantries exchanged. If these 12 men agree that the c12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung Filmsase presents enough evidence to show that the crime had in fact been committed, then the verdict will be guilty. But if there is any room for what the judge calls ""reasonable doubt"", then the verdict changes.Each character in this film is entirely different. It almost feels as though each has been handpicked to take part in a sort of experiment – and it very much feels like we are watching one unfold. Each man represents something unalike. With one man's decision not to conform, or at least not to believe everything that was discussed in the courtroom, 12 Angry Men erupts. Gradually, we start to understand these men; first, we are let it on some of their social backgrounds – one is an immigrant (possibly Greek or French) and one admits to have grown up in the same conditions as the young defendant. Both men should be able to relate to the defendant in many ways – for a moment, we are afforded a glimpse at the defendant's face, an immigrant from an anonymous ghetto. Strangely, both men vote ""guilty"" without hesitation.12 Angry Men (1957) by Sidney Lumet - Unsung FilmsHenry Fonda lets us in on his reason for disputing — he simply does not want to decide on a person's life in the space of five minutes. This is understandable; the viewer takes his side and so, it seems, does the filmmaker. But some of the jurors argue as though it were personal; as though the young man had slaughtered their own sons, daughters and wives. Some of the men, and most noticeably Cobb as juror no. 3, work themselves up into a blind fury.As the film goes on, it becomes evident that the case was never as clear as the jurors had announced at the beginning. For some, the more reasonable and likable characters, it had simply been a case of accepting the evidence provided without questions. For others, assumptions had been made as a result of deep-rooted prejudices and massive complexes. While many change their minds with the influence of rational thought, some characters simply get angrier and more aggressive; two characters give away their racist views and the powerful scene that runs over the final ten minutes, works to reveal so much about the most moving and brilliant character portrayal in the film.The happenings described in court unfold for a second time over the duration of 12 Angry Men. By the end, it as though we possess the same knowledge of what happened in the courtroom over the days of the trial, as the twelve men in the film. Helmed by Fonda, juror no. 8, the situation is played out again with incredible detail; every argument and theory presented to us is done so with such extreme care and passion. This is one of the film's that stay with you for a lifetime because its simplicity allows itself to be engraved in the mind, while the complexity of it demands that you make sure it is."

wes-connors,"Nov 22, 2009",10/10,"An outstanding reenactment of writer Reginald Rose's superlative 1954 ""Studio One"" drama. Director Sidney Lumet shows how the boundaries in cinematic art can be stretched both ways; necessarily minimalist, he moves the actors and cameras in the jury room like a finely tuned ballet. Dependable Henry Fonda gives his best, and it's one of the most convincing ""Best Actor"" performances ever committed to celluloid. The supporting cast is perfect.No matter how you feel about the film's thought-provoking thesis, you are captivated by juror Fonda's determination. When he introduces a switchblade into evidence - during deliberations! - like the pounding of a gavel, you know Fonda's intentions are premeditated; and, watching him unravel each juror's mind - along with your own - is truly stunning. Anyone interested in becoming a lawyer should consider Fonda a study model.The defense rests.********** 12 Angry Men (4/13/57) Sidney Lumet ~ Henry Fonda, Lee J. Cobb, Ed Begley, E.G. Marshall"
gavin6942,"Sep 30, 2014",9/10,"A dissenting juror (Henry Fonda) in a murder trial slowly manages to convince the others that the case is not as obviously clear as it seemed in court.Today's audiences will find a young Jack Warden, perhaps now best known as Big Ben from ""Problem Child"", and Wisconsin-born John Fiedler, whose voice is recognizable as Piglet from ""Winnie the Pooh"". Along with Ed Begley and Henry Fonda, you already have a strong cast (and the other eight men are no slouches).This film is timeless, both as a tribute to great actors of their generation, but also as a testament of the greatness of the American justice system. One likes to think this has inspired at least a few people to approach jury duty with the utmost seriousness and give the concept of ""reasonable doubt"" a run for its money."
ragosaal,"Oct 14, 2006",8/10,"+++++ POSSIBLE SPOILERS +++++""Twelve Angry Men"" is the perfect demonstration that when you have a good script, an intelligent director an a well selected cast a film doesn't have to be expensive or spectacular to be a real good one. This film is all about dialogues and acting and is set 95% in a small room yet its most entertaining and has a lot of tension.When I said it had a well selected cast I didn't mean an all star cast; Henry Fonda was the only major star; Lee Cobb, Ed Begley, Martin Balsam and E.G. Marshall where very talented supporting actors but not stars; Jack Warden and Jack Klugman weren't even known much in films yet. But a simple direction by Sidney Lumet leaving the development to the script and actors performances worked well and the film is tense, intriguing and most entertaining from beginning to end.""Twelve Angry Men"" is a ""trail film"" but with a very original focusing since by following the jury's debate the whole case is clearly revealed up to the verdict. It's also interesting that the verdict is not based in a not guilty conviction by the jurors but for the benefit of the doubt, which means that perhaps the boy actually killed his father.One of the best movies I've ever seen in its genre."
goddangwatir,"Mar 1, 2020",N/A,"12 Angry Men is a very different thriller, it isn't even classified as one here on IMDb. But it is still a thriller nontheless, since it thrills, and boy does it thrill well !It has no hidden bombs ready to detonate, no climactic shootout, no heroes getting imprisoned in the lair of the villains, but the suspense comes from one simple thing: the dialouge.12 Angry Men is built on one of the better screenplays I have seen, and that is quite a feat since 90% of the movie takes place in one single room. But that is perhaps what makes it so tense and so great; the fact that you are stuck in one room with twelve very differing jurors divided into two groups, each of them trying to debunk the arguments of the opposing side over one question; is a teen convicted of first-degree murder guilty, or not guilty ? The heated conversations between the twelve delivers constant curveballs and plot twists, some quite shocking.What I also love about the movie is the fact that it all seems like one take (comparisons can be made with the recent 1917 (2019), but perhaps not to the same extent). The excellent editing and the brilliant acting by all twelve jurors make sure of this.I have seen people complaining over the lack of music in 12 Angry Men, but in my opinion, the dialouge serves as the music, if that makes any sense. It is a pure delight to listen to.To conclude, 12 Angry Men is one of the best and most suspenseful movies I have ever seen, but in a very different way. It is a great shame that it is not as widely avaliable as some other highly rated IMDb titles, but perhaps that only adds to its factor of exclusivity.10/10"

Saw again in 2005 n then again few days back on a DVD. 12 Angry Men is a film that has aged incredibly well, offers fantastic performances, fantastic dialogues and a film that can be watched over and appreciated more and more each time. This movie shows in a marvelous simple way the mechanism of the justice system, how easily a man can be convicted to the death sentence based on prejudice, subjective declarations of witnesses and an unprofessional defense lawyer. Everything is good about this film. The screenplay by Reginald Rose (The wild geese, Escape from sobibor) is top notch. The direction by Lumet (Dog day aftnoon, Network, The verdict ) is excellent. It must be appallingly difficult to shoot an entire movie in such a small space, but Lumet does it superbly and the camera work is awesome. All the actors really got into the skin of the character n they portrayed their moods n emotions very well. Henry Fonda (The grapes of wrath, Once upon a time in the west, The longest day) n Lee J. Cobb (The exorcist, On the waterfront, Mackenna's gold) were awesome. So were the rest of the cast. It is a groundbreaking and timeless masterpiece of cinema, showing just how much can be achieved from a mundane premise. Well, so long. (Joseph Sweeney)."
evanston_dad,"Jul 5, 2005",10/10,"I defy anyone to watch this movie and not be completely absorbed in the group dynamics on display. I could take points off for the overly tidy and convenient script with its TV-movie ending or some of the less subtle methods through which director Sidney Lumet drives home his points. But with a cast as uniformly excellent as this, why quibble? Henry Fonda is just the person to play the liberal everyman, an extension of his Tom Joad character from ""The Grapes of Wrath."" E.G. Marshall is excellent as Fonda's most formidable opponent; cool-headed and logical, he's the only holdout who bases his verdict on facts instead of emotions. Lee J. Cobb's performance wears thin, and his character is the most poorly written. Ed Begley is almost too good in his role, so revolting is his character. Jack Klugman and Jack Warden register in smaller roles as well.This movie conveys the sweaty, tension-filled atmosphere of a stifling jury room but never feels oppressive, thanks to Lumet's fluid direction. My favorite moment comes when Fonda begins counting off paces around the jury table (a key piece of evidence hinges on this), and the camera drops to floor level and follows his feet as he does so. Choices like this prevent Lumet's film from ever being static or stagy.An important film and a great one. If you haven't already seen it, put it at the top of your list.Grade: A+"
SimonHeide,"Jan 2, 2008",8/10,"Overall I loved this movie. It shows the group-dynamics of 12 people, the jury, trying to decide if there is ""reasonable doubt"" concerning whether a young boy killed his father. The discussions are tense and little by little we learn from these what supposedly happened on that night the kids father died. We are therefore also drawn into the question of whether the boy did it or not ourselves and what at first seems like a clear cut case along the way becomes all of a sudden much more complicated. It is a film that dares to handle nuances and ambiguities (we are never certain of whether the boy did it or not) in a way we rarely see. Its also a movie that lets us watch these 12 angry men discuss in the same room for a full 96 minutes without it ever getting boring, which I have to respect; you really have to thrust your material to let a whole movie consist of a discussion.The movie also tries to show how personal issues can cloud the judgments of the jurors. I am thinking about one specific juror, and although the idea, of showing us how his own personal story interferes with sound judgment, is splendid, I frankly didn't like the way it unfolded in the movie. That's why I only give this movie 8/10.If this movie in any way is supposed to represent how the legal system work I pray to god that I will never be put in a situation where a jury have to decide my guilt in any matter.Regards SimonPs. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist. If you agree consider putting this post scriptum at the bottom at your own reviews."
thinker1691,"May 23, 2007",10/10,"One does not expect an ordinary black and white movie like ""Twelve Angry Men"" to set the foundation for great drama. Nevertheless, superior drama is what is delivered in this film. The setting is; a common courtroom in an eastern metropolitan city where twelve ordinary men have been selected to sit as a jury. The trial is over and the verbal testimony having been heard, the jury must now decide the fate of the young man on trial for his life. A common enough occurrence in America. But what is not common, is the mixed assortment of characters assembled for the jury. The real drama unfolds when a single juror (Henry Fonda) takes his task seriously and challenges each of his fellow members to think and then decide before they vote for the death penalty. When he does, the volatile reaction is nothing short of inspirational. One can only wish the same would happen to anyone facing a similar ordeal. The cast of characters is a vintage performance from all. Henry Fonda's performance is wonderful and courageous. He is joined by veterans actors, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, E.G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Ed Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec and Robert Webber. The honor of Classic fits this film like a velvet glove. *****"

loveballet12,"May 26, 2012",5/10,"Date: 18 May-First Time Watch-I watched this movie over the course of three days in my American Government class. By the end of the movie, more then half my class loved it. I didn't like it as much. Earlier this year we had watched 'Mr. Smith Goes to Washington' starring James Stewart. I found that one much more enjoyable since the characters did more then just sit around a table and discussing if a young boy really did kill his father or not. The story was slow, with a few surprises here and there but nothing spectacular. Our government teacher told us it was one of the best movies ever, according to the movie critics of that time, but I would have to disagree with the critics. It was just okay. Was it good to show to better understand the legal system? Yes. But, just for a movie to watch after a long week? Better keep looking.5/10"
moonspinner55,"Nov 13, 2005",8/10,"Twelve-man jury decides the fate of a young man on trial for murder; eleven think the kid is guilty, the twelfth isn't so sure. Director Sidney Lumet makes his directorial debut here, and he's overly fond of riled-up actors shouting at the camera, but he doesn't stray from the proved path of this celebrated play by Reginald Rose, and that's a plus (the material stands quite well on its own). The claustrophobic, muggy atmosphere is rife with tension, and Henry Fonda is a tower of sanity as the only voice of reason. The film attempts to substitute the electricity of a live performance with too many tight shots of angry, sweaty faces, spitting and yelling, however this ensemble cast has a rich anti-camaraderie that puts the film across. *** from ****"

as_arvind,"Jun 9, 2009",10/10,"No funny characters. No complex story. No huge cast. Just about average acting. Keep the story tight, not too complex. And stick to it and don't deviate. End result? Grand Success. Thats what this movie tells us. The story could be about anything. It doesn't have to based on a real-life or an inspiring story.12 Men talk about a same thing which will decide a young man's fate. How simpler could you put a story in a single line? Whats so breathtaking or even attention-drawing about this storyline? Really nothing.But as they talk, we are amazed to see how people could take different views over a same thing. Its also amazing to see, as a movie, the strength relies on the story and how it is told and not on characters,photography etc! The acting is just so cool and everybody gets a good share.Almost ninety percent of the movie happens inside a room where these dozen men do nothing but talk. Perfect drama-thriller with no nuisance characters or scenes."
gravanis-50517,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,"It is one of my favourite movies i had ever seen. I dont know how about to start. Everything it was amazing ,the plot the director. I didnt want to finish the conversation was from an other planet. I can see it 100 times again and i will never be bored with this movie. All the actors they was amazing. They traveled me to '50 America and i learn about their ordinary lifestyle. I learn to not judge everyone from the cover and give a try to learn from them atleast something. I suggest evereyone to see this movie atleast one time at his life. I wish one of our days one director to create a masterpice like this again and i am hopefull about it. At the end i want to tell once again that this movie was extrodinary and a man can create such a good movie with using only one room if he really want it."
adamonIMDb,"Dec 16, 2016",10/10,"It just goes to show, you can have the largest budget, the greatest special effects and the most explosive action, but all a film really needs is a great script and a great cast, and '12 Angry Men' is a testament to that. Despite being over 60 years old now, this is rightly still considered by many to be one of the best films of all time.Despite virtually the entirety of this film being set in one room, this has to be one of the most compelling dramas I've seen. For a film with such a simple format, it had me hooked from start to finish.The characters are fascinating, they all have depth and back stories, come from different backgrounds and walks of life and each have unique characteristics and personalities. The script is also excellent, a masterpiece in itself.This is one of the simplest films ever made, but it's also one of the best. '12 Angry Men' is a timeless classic that will live long in the memory."
vaderboy,"Nov 6, 2020",7/10,"I agree with many of the reviews- less is more, great cast of actors. Love the premise of just following the jury in the room. Honestly after the first 30 minutes you could kind of tell where this story line was headed and it wasn't much of a surprise at the end. I just don't see this movie in the same league as some of the others at the top of best movie lists- Shawshank, Godfather, Schindler's list, even Pulp Fiction. It's not just because it is a classic black and white movie, I love that about it. It's a Wonderful Life blows this away. I will have to watch it again one day and see if I have a different opinion since everyone else seems enthralled with this movie. For me it was worth watching, but would not be anywhere near my top 20 best films ever."
edchin2006,"Mar 7, 2008",5/10,"You couldn't make make me sit through this one again!Watching 12 stereotypes shaken together until the cream rises to the top is little better than watching water come to a boil. At first, the cold water is still and transparent, then tiny bubbles begin to form - yet the water is not even warm! It is the air coming out of solution! The bubbles grow larger and rise to the surface. Again, the water is clear, but movement can be detected. There are swirling convection currents forming. The water becomes hot. There is more and more movement, the surface of the water is clearly undulating, and the water is getting hotter. Bubbles again begin to form at the bottom of the pot. They expand and begin to rise, but collapse and disappear. The expansion and collapse of the water vapor creates noise and the pot begins to vibrate. Then traces of water vapor begin to rise from the rolling surface of the water. Finally, the bubbles of water vapor survive the journey to the surface and emerge - releasing steam to the air. How exciting!Somehow, I just knew how everything would turn out - just like watching water boil, or shaking milk (I was around before homogenized milk).I would recommend Andy Warhol's ""Empire"" to those who like this film. I won't give away the ending, but it's fairly predictable, and a bit longer than watching water boil."
bellino-angelo2014,"Mar 17, 2019",10/10,"This is one of the greatest movies not only of the 1950s, but of all time. What makes it unique are the direction, the actors' performances, the cinematography and the set. In my opinion, whoever loves classic movies or movies in general should watch this movie at least once in a lifetime - it's that great and perfect! This movie should be even shown in film schools as a textbook example of how to make a movie without special effects but only with a good script and talented actors. That's it: a movie shot in black and white and for almost all the time the film is set in a small room.The direction (by Sidney Lumet in his debut) is top-notch and the actors' performances are all career-bests. Henry Fonda has never given a better performance than the one he gives in this movie, and all the other actors - Jack Warden, Jack Klugman, Robert Webber, Lee J. Cobb, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler for naming a few - who were still unknown at the time, are great here and give great support to Fonda. All in all, an exceptional movie in all ways."
roberliz,"Sep 19, 2020",10/10,"A amster piece of story telling and acting

I wonder the movie was released in 1957 but still seems fresh. The matters and questions raised ask for answers in present world also.

ethanbresnett,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,"12 Angry Men is proof that you don't need any bells or whistles to make a practically perfect film.What seems like a relatively simple premise develops into one of the most engrossing and intelligent screenplays I've ever seen. The dialogue is so well thought out, the characters crafted to perfection. Every story beat, every revelation, every examination of evidence is played out to perfection.Needless to say the performances are stellar, which elevates the film to a whole other level.What more is there to say? Perfect."
AugustMatrix,"May 9, 2019",N/A,"It's a great film, lasting and refreshing, and time will not affect its position in the slightest way.The whole film has only a few scenes, the plot is completely focused on all the characters, the narrow space and hot weather is to stimulate contradictions and conflicts."
mgray91,"Oct 24, 2010",7/10,"Twelve Angry Men was a very good movie, with good dialogue and an excellent cast. The cast had a lot of opposite personalities which made the dynamics on the movie very interesting to watch. Although the audio was not as good as present day films and the dialogue was occasionally slow, the tension and interplay of the jurors quickly picked up again and kept your interest in the movie. It was amazing how one by one Henry Ford's character was able to convert all the other jurors over to a non-guilty verdict. It was really scary how all of the other 11 jurors wanted to vote guilty just to get the trial over with because they didn't want to be stuck at the courthouse. They all had better things to do, like go to a baseball game or visit with the friends and they didn't want to look to closely at the accuracy of the testimony, but Henry Ford's character made them take the time to think it through. Watching the movie Twelve Angry Men was much better than reading the written play because you could really see all the characters more clearly. The emotions, the tension and the frustration was so much more obvious in the film and came across so much more strongly than it did in written form. A movie that I would recommend to anyone who wants to sit down and watch and old black and white film with a strong cast of stars."
bfwam,"Nov 25, 2016",2/10,"I hope that people don't see the score without reading the reviews as much as I think they do. Believe me, I find that you can still enjoy a movie, even respect it, without liking it. This is definitely the case with 12 Angry men. While I can enjoy the experience of watching the film, I've come to the rather unpopular opinion that this is not a great film. 12 Angry men works far better as a stage play, than a movie. As a film, it's quit uninspired and lacking emotion. The dialogue being as uninteresting as your least favorite math class, this is only accentuated by the fact that this film attempts to carry itself on dialogue and performance. Another problem comes right from the name itself; 12. The 12 angry men in the film are mostly indiscernible from each other, excluding a select few. While on stage the characters can show a lot of complexity with each actor playing off of each others emotions and bringing something new to performances each night, the film is lacking in character development."
shanelubish,"May 31, 2019",9/10,I was surprised that a movie that basically takes place in one room could be so great. This is the perfect movie for the quote don't judge a book by its cover.
shawnbarr-76882,"Feb 4, 2017",10/10,"This film is a must see! No bells and whistles here, just the clear suspenseful plot of 12 men negotiating the future of a young man charged with murdering his father. Simply made, this black and white classic is nearly exclusively filmed in the confines of a small, hot, and miserable jurors room.Juror #8, played by Henry Fonda, sets the standard initially with the sole ""Not Guilty"" vote. Each character then has to do some serious soul-searching to remove personal bias, conformity, and arrogance to properly perform their civic duty of determining the accused youth's fate. Sidney Lumet masterfully composes an instant classic by giving the viewers an inner look at individual and group conflict along with conflict resolution. This film is a great case study for communication styles for individuals and groups, as well.Award winning acting, simplistic yet revealing dialogue, and before it's time camera angles and editing join together beautifully to create a suspense driven plot without the use of action, color, special effects, or an expensive budget."
igauravchoudhary,"Sep 11, 2018",10/10,"While conversations were taking part, viewers were forced to imagine entire scenario. Amazing movie in every aspect of filming. This is what filming is all about. Masterpiece"
kikoydaba3,"Jul 7, 2019",10/10,"12 Angry Men is a timeless classic relevant in any time period. Set exclusively in a jury room, the film exceeds the four corners of its setting presenting themes with great depth and handle about politics, interpersonal relationship, prejudice, bias and hope. In the age of social media and instant news, the film asks us to question our personal thoughts and belief. The film is a cinematic triumph of logic over emotion.A story about 12 men sitting as jurors faced with a decision to deliver a verdict on an accused teenager, the jurors are locked as a single hold out, Juror 8, played by Henry Fonda votes not guilty. Against overwhelming odds, Juror 8 manages to convince another juror who proclaims it is not easy to stand alone from the ridicule of others. The film gradually reveals more questions as a guilty verdict beyond reasonable doubt is slowly eroded and each character's motivations is gradually revealed. Every juror presents his arguments but these all fall when reasonable doubt exists attacking the testimony as more and more jurors vote not guilty. Despite being confined to a single room, the film is nonetheless a thriller. The film slowly reveals that men are often dictated by emotion and not reason. Juror 3, played by Lee J. Cobb, is the main antagonist but is also at heart and the opposite end of the film's struggle between guilty and not guilty. The subplot of his relationship with his estranged son finds resolution when he becomes the final juror to vote not guilty from guilty. With a cast to envy portraying every imaginable human emotion, 12 Angry Men flawlessly treads its themes with character growth in a cathartic ending. Even its black and white color is a representation of the gray area people live in a prejudiced world.Ultimately, the film speaks about our everyday politics but also as a redemption and heroic tale against odds. 12 Angry Men will continue to be appreciated for generations to come and deserves its place among cinema's masterpiece.10/10"
SciberSpacer,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"I have watched this film many times and expect to watch it many more times in the future.

TheDragonTrader,"Sep 21, 2018",9/10,"Twelve cosmically different men in one room deciding over the life and death of an accused... such a great premise.

More than once I found myself wanting to scream at the characters and tell them what I thought. Few movies can absorb me like this one did. A well deserved ten stars! Brilliant in every way!"
drewvogelaar,"Sep 3, 2022",N/A,"The first time I discovered IMDB's top 250 list, I noticed that ""12 Angry Men"" was the 5th best movie ever. I had heard of the film but only the version starring Jack Lemmon from 1997. After some research, I realized this film has one of the strongest casts of any movie ever released. Its cast has much success outside of this film. Out of the 12 jurors, five nominations for Oscars, three won Oscars, seven received an Emmy nomination, and six received a Golden Globe nomination. Henry Fonda, who is the film's lead actor, is one of my favorites of all time. His film ""On Golden Pond"" is a film that I view as perfection. Fond's performance in this film is one of the finest of his career.This film also is directed by Sidney Lumet, who made another favorite movie of mine ""Murder on the Orient Express."" This film is one of those films that is pretty much perfect. I don't love it as much as ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" but I love it more than any other courtroom drama. It's better than my other two favorite courtroom dramas, ""My Cousin Vinny"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt."" I think it's much better than the highly overrated ""To Kil a Mockingbird."" I don't see what people see in that film. I think it's a six.In Conclusion. This film is not the best Henry Fonda film (On Golden Pond). This film is not the best Sidney Lumet film (Murder on the Orient Express). It's not even the best Martin Balsam (Juror #1) film (Psycho). But it's one of my favorite films, Easily a 10/10."

Sethtro,"Jun 26, 2020",10/10,"Personal Rating: 10/10If someone asked you to create a compelling film, shot in only one location, black and white, a dozen actors, no fancy camera work, almost non-stop dialogue, and based entirely on an argument, could you do it?Well, 12 Angry Men rises to that exact occasion. If you're one that appreciates some mystery, drama, a rollercoaster of a ride, you'll enjoy this movie. Granted it's not for all, its lack of action, romance or Michael Bay explosions may have some falling asleep, but to those who appreciate a good thriller, it'll have you on the edge of your seat the whole time.It's easy to become desensitized today about what truly makes a good movie, with CGI a norm, relying solely on A list actors and actresses instead of a good screenplay prolific, we forget just how powerful well-written dialogue is. It's that dialogue that transports you into this movie, that thrusts you into the whirlwind of plot and emotion and doesn't let go until the movie's over. You walk away from this film in awe, not thinking well if 100 million dollars falls in my lap I could make a movie like that. No, you start thinking, damn, I have no excuse, this movie proves that it's story that matters, not extravagant displays of big budgets. And I feel that needs to be celebrated, acknowledged, and loved."
louisealvin,"Jun 1, 2020",10/10,"In the overheated jury room of the New York County Courthouse, a jury prepares to deliberate the case of an 18-year-old impoverished youth accused of stabbing his father to death. The judge instructs them that if there is any reasonable doubt, the jurors are to return a verdict of not guilty. If found guilty, the defendant will receive a death sentence. The verdict must be unanimous.
The evidence at first seems convincing. A neighbor testified to witnessing the defendant stab his father from her window. Another neighbor testified that he heard the defendant threaten to kill his father and the father's body hitting the ground, and then, through his peephole, saw the defendant run past his door. The boy has a violent past and had recently purchased a switchblade of the same type as was found at the murder scene, but claimed he lost his. The knife at the scene had been cleaned of fingerprints.
In a preliminary vote, all jurors vote guilty except Juror 8, who believes that there should be some discussion before the verdict is made. He questions the reliability of the witnesses. Producing his own switchblade, he throws doubt on the supposed uniqueness of the murder weapon. He says he cannot vote guilty because reasonable doubt exists. Juror 8 suggests a secret ballot, from which he will abstain; if all the other jurors still vote guilty, he will acquiesce. The ballot reveals one not guilty vote. Juror 9 reveals that he changed his vote, agreeing there should be more discussion.
Juror 8 argues that the noise of a passing train would have obscured the threat the second witness claimed to have overheard. Juror 5 changes his vote, as does Juror 11, who believes the defendant, had he truly killed his father, would not have returned to the crime scene several hours later to retrieve the murder weapon as it had already been cleaned of fingerprints. Juror 8 points out that people often say ""I'm going to kill you"" without literally meaning it.
Jurors 5, 6, and 8 further question the second witness's story. Juror 3 is infuriated, and after a verbal argument, tries to attack Juror 8, shouting ""I'll kill him!"". Juror 8 points out that this proves his point about the defendant's words. Jurors 2 and 6 change their votes; the jury is now evenly split.
Juror 4 doubts the defendant's alibi, based on the boy's inability to recall certain details. Juror 8 tests Juror 4's own memory. He is able to remember events from the previous week, with some difficulty. Jurors 2, 3, and 8 debate whether the defendant could have stabbed his much-taller father from a downward angle, eventually deciding it was physically possible, though awkward. Juror 5 points out that someone who knew how to use a switchblade would have stabbed underhand at an upwards angle.
Impatient to leave, Juror 7 changes his vote and is confronted by Juror 11; Juror 7 insists, albeit unconvincingly, that he thinks the defendant is not guilty. Jurors 1 and 12 also change their votes, leaving only three guilty votes. Juror 10 erupts in racially motivated vitriol. The rest of the jurors turn their backs to him and Juror 4 tells him to sit down and be quiet. Juror 4 declares that the woman who saw the killing from across the street stands as solid evidence. Juror 12 reverts back to a guilty vote.
Juror 9 realizes that the witness, coming from bed, would not have had time to put on her glasses in time to see the assault occur, making her story dubious. The remaining jurors, except Juror 3, change their vote to not guilty.
Juror 3 gives an increasingly tortured string of arguments, building on earlier remarks about his strained relationship with his own son. In a moment of rage, Juror 3 tears up a photograph of him and his son before breaking down sobbing. He mutters not guilty, making the vote unanimous. As the others leave, Juror 8 helps the distraught Juror 3 with his coat. The defendant is found not guilty off-screen and the jurors leave the courthouse. In a brief epilogue, Jurors 8 and 9 introduce each other for the first time by their names before parting."
MrskiViletic,"Sep 18, 2019",10/10,"An excellent example of movie making that is impressive and still holds up to this day. The camera movement, the long shots, the composition and actor movements are executed to perfection, making this viewing a one of a kind. The story is gripping, revolving around a murder trial of a Latino boy accused of killing his father and the twelve men who will decide his faith. The cast does a great job with the portrayal of the various jurors and the complex reasons they lean to one verdict or the other presenting us with twelve massively different characters each with his own flaws and his own views of morality and human nature. An amazing feat of cinema rightfully considered on of the crown jewels of Old Hollywood."

The set hardly ever changes and all you have is this twelve men sitting there talking... but what might seem like a bored turns out to be the most engaging drama as they debate the case and we see moments of prejudice, social injustice, racism, discrimination, family drama and hurtful despondency from one member of the jury or the other."

Well written and some great acting, no Hollywood clichés the actors speak normally and realistically. It is pretty much filmed in one room so this makes you concentrate and listen to what the actors are saying.We are in a time when CGI and special effects are everywhere. A film such as 12 angry men is a welcome change from this.Special mention to Henry Fonda, great actor."

fatman-3,"Feb 24, 2002",N/A,All of the drama this movie has to offer stems from the fact that one juror could express his opinions better than any of the other jurors.Those with poor communications skills gave the viewer a false  impression that they were shallow people who formed an opinion based on reasons other than the merits of the trial.The question that must be answered throughout the movie is: Should a juror's personal limitations in expressing himself bottle up solid evidence in deciding whether a defendant is guilty or innocent?
alanjj,"Dec 11, 2001",6/10,"It's a movie that takes place in one hot, smoke-filled, sweaty room, at a time when men felt naked if they took their jacket and tie off.  11 come into the room wanting to fry the defendant; one man starts pointing out all the ambiguous testimony.  He nobly upholds the concept of ""reasonable doubt.""  Guess who triumphs?The movie is remarkable.  Sidney Lumet was even then a master filmmaker. The claustrophobia is palpable, but the camera is fluid enough to give you every angle on the closed, locked room, and every emotion and bead of sweat on the men trapped there.The story, however, presents easy heroes and villains:  the everyman just trying to make sure justice is done; the bigot who can't keep his opinions to himself; the noble immigrant.  Cliches all, even back in 1957.Yet, the cast is so real.  These are real, sweaty, down-to-earth actors putting on the performances of their lives.  You always feel like you are in there with them, following the logic, thinking about whether the evidence presented is believable.It's searing, yet dopey."
RayCharles81,"Sep 2, 2023",4/10,"For its time, this movie must've been excellent. However, today it holds up as a good older movie that was filmed in black and white with many other older films in its time, shortly before, and shortly after surpassing it. Films such as Casablanca, Vertigo, North by Northwest, Gone With the Wind, Some Like It Hot, Sunset Boulevard, and many others are equally as good for this time period, and some are much better.While I did appreciate and respect the movie and even liked it, I was very surprised at how high it was ranked on here at number five. There were no major plot twists, surprises, or even tour de force performances that you would also see in some other black and white older films. The concept was very interesting and kept my attention, but even some of the arguments and deductions that the jurors made were not truly logical. Some of them were intelligent, like when Henry Fonda measured the amount of time it would take for the older man witness to walk to the door, as well as when he proved he could purchase the weapon, but overall some of the points made were guesswork.The truth is that at the end of the day, the director decides to paint Fonda's character as an ideal perfect person while clealry letting the culprit, likely guilty, walk free, which I felt betrayed the script's ambiguity. And to be totally honest, it would have been a much better movie, warranting a ranking of five all-time, if there was a plot twist that one of the juror's arguing for guilt was indeed the actual culrpit- a twist I was waiting and hoping for that I never got. Instead, we get a glorification of Fonda's character to the very end, ironically an antihero that wasn't truly meant to be that allowed the guilty one walk free.6/10."

mmmmm2019,"Jan 4, 2021",10/10,"In all the years that the film industry has been in force, massive and millionaire productions have been created... but films that I could say are almost perfect. No! Simply perfect, they would only be counted on the fingers of one hand.The script is the most important thing from my point of view, plus the narrative; And this movie squeezed all this to its maximum potential, it knows when to take breaks to delve into the characters and explain why they act like this.
Knows very well how to create tension in the necessary moments and later finish with plot twists.
But the best thing about the film is the way it builds a world so real, so authentic to affirm that the characters are completely human, there is no hero or villain; There are no implausible situations that could only exist within a movie, thus doing the magnificent job of wrapping us in their world like no other movie."
perviz_abdullayev,"Nov 26, 2016",9/10,"12 Angry Men is the film that changed my opinion about all black-and- white films. Before this film, I think this type of old films is boring, so I don't ""waste"" my time with these ones. But when I watched this film, I changed all my mind about it.The film is literally masterpiece. There is no action or mind-blowing parts. All story goes on in one room and the thing is almost everything seems as mystery, but real. The case which our jury have to decide about, jurors, their actions and judgement is so well considered. One of the most interesting parts of the film is that no name mentioned until the very end.Also it is very hard to shot the whole film only in one place, one room. So crew had done great work. A piece of art. So I think it is the best film to start old and gold films."
Carbonelldolz,"Aug 26, 2015",10/10,"This is one of the best films that I have ever seen. I saw it for the first time in a business class and that day I made my a trip that I have never forgotten. It is the type of films that you begin thinking that you are going to be bored, and after some minutes, your curiosity begins to grow until the moment when you fall in love with it. It is a trip of understanding, of doubting about everything and a lesson about the truth that usually is not something that can be seen at a first look. A wonderful script, perfect performances and a great direction. The unique thing that somebody that likes cinema can say about this film is that it is a masterpiece that need to be seen more than one time to really see all the nuances and to really appreciate it as it deserves. It is in the Top 10, but maybe it should have a better position.If you like thrillers, justice films and you like interesting dialogues, this is your film. However, it is going to ask you for your concentration and tenacity."
rubenmv,"Aug 1, 2020",10/10,"This is a movie I always recommend and but find it difficult to explain why, because the main plot seems very basic at first and there is not much to say about it, but once you are watching it, it traps you, every character is interesting on their own way. Masterfully written, it is more exciting than many other big blockbusters."

Stephan_fr,"Feb 18, 2023",5/10,"I love my kino, and love my classics, so let's get down to brass tacks as to why I give this a 6.* The movie is timeless. It could have been shot in any decade.* The movie was well ahead of its time in terms of photography... and that's about it.But, just like the jurors in ""12AM"", we must look beyond the 'facts'.* First, the acting. It's superb at times, and really quaint not-in-a-good way in others. So while the photography has not aged one bit, the acting and the characterization has.* Second, the plot line. There's so much good stuff in there, it's so well paced, that it's too easy to overlook the bad: the ending is as flat as they come (bombastic trumpets of the victor leaving the court in his white suit, really?), and the ""Kaiser Sauze"" moment that's hinted at from the beginning never comes. Ergo, it's didactic, and ergo, it's not that ""mind blowing"" at all.* Third, it's a movie that's getting a lot of good ratings because of the current political climate. It's easy to call this timeless while taking down a disney attraction because it's linked to ""Song of the South"". It's also convenient to honour a movie that references the constitution amendment while ignoring that 2A is a thing. Funny how college in the US pick their 'Timeless classics"".In conclusion, your honor, I think we need a recount here.5 sounds perfect: did i like it? Did I not? You'll never know."
dpolwatte,"Dec 9, 2018",8/10,"Purely dramatic and an instant classic from the times of the vintage arts were created. A reminder of Hitchcock's ""Rope"" but brings something more artistic and moral than the latter.Amazing piece of work and classic that will live forever.Overall - 4/5"
yusufkaanatanur,"Mar 8, 2021",10/10,"The picture captured a whole event and made the viewer care about this story about a boy while using only one location. This just shows us how well-written it is. The blocking and cinematography were impeccable, just like the acting served by Henry Fonda and others. All in all, the film made us defend a boy without even showing him properly and not physically going through any of the scenes which is mesmerising to say the least."
victorjonel,"May 22, 2019",10/10,"A masterpiece. Excellent script, acting and shots from the director. Definitely you can call it a flawless movie."
donnaroberts-57981,"May 18, 2020",10/10,One of the most impressive films I've ever seen. It's just 12 men sitting around a table but the tension just keeps building. Wonderful film.
aavic,"Aug 31, 2015",9/10,"12 angry men is a courtroom drama based on the premise that all defendants deserve a fair trial until proved guilty. The film is a very simplistic take on the presumption of innocence and takes place almost entirely within a small New York City court room as 12 men debate the fate of a young defendant charged with murdering his father. In the start all jurors think of the case as an open and shut case except one; Juror No. 8 played by Henry Fonda. But as they discuss the the available evidence, it turns out it is not simple as it seems to be. Most of the jurors are prejudiced and it takes the staunch effort from the character played by Fonda to induce logic and sense into the proceedings.The film builds tension through conflict among the jurors and the dialogue. The length is only 95 minutes but it feels as if it is shot in real time. The direction and camera-work is excellent. The jurors are all well defined in terms of their personalities, occupations, prejudices and the emotional reasons behind those prejudices. All the cast members make an excellent effort into bringing these characters to life.The movie is not about solving the crime although all the available evidence is heavily discussed, it is about the jury passing a judgment on the life of a boy. It is a take on the strength of the jury and their power to decide a man's survival and it performs this job in an excellent manner. The movie is a rare gem and I highly recommend it to anyone who loves great cinema."
trevor-pert,"Nov 18, 2003",N/A,"My dream come true: 100% dialogue-driven, and captivating!The characters are varied enough to make the show interesting.  The plot serves its purpose in providing a backdrop for the human interaction and issues to be explored.  The resolution touches on how our biases originate."
HotToastyRag,"Sep 11, 2022",7/10,"I completely recognize that 12 Angry Men is a classic, but it's just not my favorite old movie. If Lee J. Cobb didn't give such a fantastic performance, I wouldn't like it at all. As many plays do (although this movie was originally a television production and subsequently adapted to the stage), it has a definite message and tries as hard as possible to convince the audience that the writer is correct. Unfortunately, I wasn't convinced. I maintained my belief that in the United States of America, everyone is entitled to his own opinion. Lee J. Cobb nearly echoes this sentiment verbatim in the film, with extreme passion. Henry Fonda (and writer Reginald Rose) argue that in the United States, the ""reasonable doubt"" portion of the jury system is more important than every man's right to a different opinion.In essence, the jury starts the film seemingly all decided to decide guilty to a murder trial. While giving their preliminary vote in the back room, Hank realizes he will be the only one with the power to prolong the discussion. If he votes guilty with the rest, the deliberation (and the movie) will be over. So, he votes not-guilty, and forces the other eleven men to re-think things. But it isn't really fair, if you're on Lee's side of the story. If you're on Team Hank, this might be one of your favorite movies of all time. A truly impartial jury is nearly impossible, as anyone who's ever had an opinion or life experience that shaped their views. Any of those twelve men is entitled to his opinion, but this film argues that peer pressure should be more powerful than individuality. As Hank brow-beats other jurors into voting not-guilty, Lee and a few others remain firm. Will it turn out to be a hung jury, or will the American justice system prevail?One aspect of the film I will compliment is the setting. The movie starts with the jurors walking into the deliberation room, and the entire movie takes place there. We never see the trial or hear evidence; everything is the discussion. It's an interesting style, because the point is not for the audience to get involved in the case or to make up their own minds. The point is, as mentioned, that if the jury has a reasonable doubt, they must acquit. The cast is also a great asset to the film. All professionals, all giving their unique characters their all - although I do wish the original lead from television was kept on for the movie. Franchot Tone can act circles around Henry Fonda, and he has integrity, passion, and class; he was traded in for a monotonous, whiny voiced bad actor.Still, Martin Balsam, John Fiedler, E. G. Marshall, Jack Klugman, Edward Binns, Jack Warden, Joseph Sweeney, Ed Begley, George Voskovec, Robert Webber, and of course, Lee J. Cobb, are exactly what the film calls for. Lee couldn't have been any better, and it pained us at the Hot Toasty Rag Awards that he didn't take home the newspaper award for Best Supporting Actor. There was enormously stiff competition in that 1957 category, and all the nominees were truly winners."
benn-k,"Nov 16, 2023",5/10,"I can't believe this film has such a high rating on here. Nothing happens the entire time. The title isn't even accurate as half the men aren't angry. You can expect no plot beyond the jury changing sides from guilty to not guilty and a lot of shouting generic 50s dialog. Whilst the acting is good the characters are bland and have no real substance or development.When people say they don't make them like they used to, they certainly aren't referring to this film. You should save yourself just under two hours and avoid this boring ""must watch classic"" unless you need something to help you get to sleep."
stargaze-7,"Jan 20, 1999",8/10,"This movie makes you wonder whether the jury system is the best way of deciding the outcome of a court case. Twelve ""ordinary"" men and women decide the fate of the defendant - how many are objective about the process? Some bring personal prejudices into the jury room - others couldn't care less about the outcome. These points are effectively raised in the movie.Even though the action is confined to one room, the dialogue kept me riveted to the screen till the end. All the actors portrayed the different personalities of the jurors very well."
jldehaan,"Apr 30, 2020",10/10,"I first watched this film in 11th grade government class, and immediately loved it! With an all star cast including Henry Fonda, John Fiedler, Lee J. Cobb, and Jack Klugman, this movie masterpiece gives heart, humor and inspiration"
JDoug42,"Dec 30, 2021",9/10,"Most films featuring ensemble casts include up to a handful of 'main characters', alongside a slew of secondary characters that never receive very thorough characterization. I was stunned at how deep and fleshed out every single one of the 12 jurors was in 12 Angry Men. Apart from Henry Fonda, the arguable lead man in the dissenting Juror #8, every character shares the screen equally.Fighting to dominate the screen might be
better phrasing than 'sharing' the screen. This is 12 powerhouse performances, ensuring that there isn't a moment's lull despite being filmed almost exclusively in one claustrophobic deliberation room. The powerfully acted, incredibly written jurors will leave their personalities imprinted in your mind long after the relatively brief runtime is up."

jimmykhalife,"Dec 6, 2018",10/10,"What can you make of a movie that takes place during the course of one day, and located in the same room? Two options: a bore or a masterpiece.

Long story short, you won't be able to take your eyes off of it, a classic must see."

The_Real_Review,"Sep 6, 2023",1/10,"12 Angry Men is a pretentious amateur ""detective"" story who's manipulative intent was easy to spot a mile away. As soon as they showed Henry Fonda's character of the The Architect (Juror # 8) I knew he was going to be the only one emotional enough to vote not guilty and with the help of very poor writing convince everyone else to do the same. Sure enough I was right.Juror # 8 starts off just believing the 19-year old suspect was abused by his father for ""years"" with absolutely no evidence other than his bleeding heart and not simply disciplined for all the crimes he committed which included mugging, auto theft, robbery and knife fighting because as we know no one ever lies except of course all the eye witnesses in this trial and the detectives.The Architect just makes one nonsense argument after another and every valid point brought up by the skeptics is just brushed aside until they finally change their mind for no logical reasoning whatsoever.For instance, juror # 8 just manufacturers a time frame with no evidence to support it about how long it takes elevated train cars to pass by a single point. He does this based on his alleged past experience of living in an apartment near an elevated train line and everyone just buys it with no argument. This is embarrassingly bad for a number of reasons;Since the film is set in New York City around 1956-57 we can find that during this time period there were 3 distinct elevated train car types (MUDC, Q-CARS and LO-V) from 7 different manufacturers (ACF, Cincinnati, IRT, Jewett, Pullman St. Louis, Wason) operating. It is just assumed in the film that every elevated train in NYC is made up of identical length, height and speed trains with the exact same window dimensions and placement when nothing could be farther from the truth.What year did Juror # 8 have this apartment and what exact trains were running on the line at that time? Were those the same type's of train cars involved in this case? No answer is given. This is the equivalent of saying that you flew out of an airport years ago therefore all planes are the same and fly at the same speed with no control by the pilot.Trains are operated by conductors and are variable speed, they speed up and slow down. At any given day a conductor could be running a train faster or slower for any number of reasons. They could be trying to make up time being late and running the train faster, they could have been tired and running the train slower to be safe or any number of other variables. There is no way to know the exact timing of the train that day unless you were there to time it.Then the old man juror becomes an amateur criminal profiler and accuses the old man witness of lying to be important with no actual evidence to support this just his worthless opinion based on how he looks.A juror not remembering the details of a movie is not an argument. The day a family member of mine died I have the movie I was watching seared into my head and will never forgot it. During times of increased stress like this you become hyper aware of everything.The entire debate over how the suspect would have stabbed his dad is waste of time, all that matters was if it was plausible. How a juror would hold the knife is irrelevant.Apparently the jurors have never heard of reading glasses or sunglasses which first became popular in the 1920's and The Stockbroker (Juror # 4) just decides to become an idiot on this point for no reason.This is a manipulative and poorly written film designed to sow doubt where none exists and to instead have you believe in emotional reasoning over logic."
zomfilm,"Mar 21, 2020",10/10,"I can only say that this film is beyond cinema and life
A movie that could not lose its appeal without any extra cost and other locations and extra actors, and the viewer could see it with enthusiasm."
cmcastl,"Mar 1, 2017",10/10,"There are, that I know of, two legal systems, the Anglo-Saxon adversarial system and the French system. The French system has judge and jury as paid legal officials. The idea behind that is that trained and experienced legal officials at all stages of the process can deliver a better verdict. But the weakness is that such a system is more open to political corruption. In the English system there is judge, jury - made up of ordinary people who are drafted - and barristers. With some tweaks, the American system follows the British system.Which is the better? An un-answerable question but a fascinating one.I have always thought there is a moral ambiguity at the heart of this film. The number of genuinely decent, intelligent, educated and well-meaning jurors seems to be outweighed by the number of bigoted, prejudiced, mentally lazy and ill-educated ones. In the latter category, what psychologists today call those affected by 'motivated reasoning', made founding US father Alexander Hamilton distrustful of pure democracy and hence his electoral college to elect the President. So this film is a powerful disquisition on both the Anglo-Saxon jury system and democracy. Actually, any legal system is intimately a reflection of the political system.The moral core of the film is Henry Fonda, of course, whom Republicans today would call a 'bleeding-heart liberal'; certainly some of the characters in the film called him that more or less literally so that conservative pejorative labelling is not new. His willingness to give the young defendant, accused of killing his father, in what some of the jurors lazily called an 'open and shut' case, what you Americans call a 'fair shake' is what drives the plot. Then other jurors, better intentioned, rally to his standard and others less enlightened subsequently rally to his standard, as most people do to a true leader, one of his persuasive qualities and of his quality of character, if only to follow the tide of loyalty.One of the jurors calls Henry Fonda's character an exponent of the soft-sell. But that plain-Joe juror doesn't understand the difference between selling marmalade, which is the latter's job, and intelligence allied to a genuine conscience, which are the hall-mark qualities of Henry Fonda's 'architect' persona.Solon, the ancient Greek lawgiver, was once asked what would it take for justice to come into this world. He replied that justice would only come into this world if enough people who did not suffer injustice would feel for those who did. We are not there yet.In any film, play or novel a successful one is one in which all the leading characters are well-rounded and you feel that if you met them on the street you would recognise them immediately. This the film amply fulfills. Apart from anything else, the film is a master-class in top American actors of the late fifties.I would certainly like a Henry Fonda character on my jury if I ever faced murder in the first degree.But the curious thing is, the curious thing is, that on reviewing the evidence as it is presented in the film and despite the attempt at rebuttal which is the agenda of this film, I think the evidence stacked more against the defendant than for him! But I repeat, I would surely pray for a Henry Fonda character on my jury.One of the characters in the Sidney Lumet's excellent 'The Verdict', (1982) a wise old black doctor, (I likee how it was so aptly described as a 'legal Rocky') consoles Paul Newman's lawyer with the sentence that juries can sometimes surprise one in the rightness of their verdict. I guess for all its faults the Anglo-Saxon version of justice is the better."
amirabbas_moslehi,"Feb 12, 2022",10/10,"It is the best low cost movies I've ever seen. You will starring at the screen for 90 minutes whereas all the story happens just in a room. Actors performed great specially Henry Fonda. I believe that everyone should watch this amazing movie. In my opinion it's not just a movie, in fact it's a classroom to learn how not to judge others simply. I admire the director too. Before I started watching the movie I thought it is a dull story, but after finishing this unique movie I found out to make a wonderful movie you don't need many locations or heavy visual effects, you just need a camera and some good actors."

But the actors, location, events are so boring, nothing to see. Talk dominates, and more like political ones. Maybe good only for law lovers, workers, students who love it or learn about it or it is their career."

JonasDalb,"Dec 16, 2021",10/10,"This movie is about so many different things. It's touching the subjects of independent thinking, not to judge a book by its cover, humanity and the value of facts. Well, I guess you can even relate it to the wave of fake news in our society today. But for me more than everything else, this movie is a tribute to the american democracy. We see 11 men who change their opinion by the power of strong arguments from Juror #8, and thats exactly what the democratic conversation is about. The idea that conversations and arguments from conflicting sides led to the best possible outcome is a cornerstone of democracy. Therefore, this movie is also about being open-minded and willing to listen to others in order to gain more knowledge."

fachryfhidayat,"May 13, 2019",10/10,"A story about 12 men who come from different background, a different point of view, different goals, different motive, and different argument to act as juries facing a complicated murder case. When 11 of them thought it was an easy decision to make, there was also effort from Juror 8 (Henry Fonda) to reveal what was really happened with the case and save a boy's life form death sentence. This film shows what logic can do to break prejudice and how a single decision can decide on a boy's life.Set of the place is one of the most important parts of a film. 12 Angry Men is unique because it only has one set of place located in the juror's room. But, if we thought this film will be boring because only has one set of place, we must be terribly wrong. Sidney Lumet has successfully directed the film with intense argument and interesting interaction between the jurors without forgetting ""the simpleness"" itself. All of the actors successfully drive their emotional expression towards the discussion. The dialogue is brilliant, genius, and remarkable, it makes all of the characters have their own signature and characteristics. The most important thing is this film didn't tell us who is the real murderer of the case. But only to decide whether the boy is guilty or not.This is such a masterpiece from Sidney Lumet, the main idea of the movie is to decide someone's life. This film tells us that must be a logical explanation for everything, despite all of the prejudice that appears in the whole case. The script success to make us think whether the boy is guilty or not and makes the intensity of the movie felt so real."

john.wilson28@ntlworld.com,"Sep 1, 2015",10/10,"I first watched this film on DVD about ten years ago after my manager at work kept going on about how good it was. At first I was a bit wary thinking it was going to be just another court room drama. When the movie finished I realised what a masterpiece it was. How a movie could grip the attention of the audience for over 90 minutes with the whole film taking place, with the exception of a few minutes, in just one room was remarkable. The actors, each with their various characters, were excellent and the acting superb.....One of my most favourite films of which I never get tired of watching....if you have not seen it, watch and you will be impressed."

The last scene, when Fonda walks out into the fresh air and gives a fond glance to the immense pillars of justice caused me to shed some tears, because I wasn't sure if I shared his abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of JUSTICE. In memory, the power of this film has faded, because it seems too comically optimistic. Justice ALWAYS triumphs in the end. It's a well-meaning, compassionate message, but it is also irresponsible. (Or is the message perhaps, that compassionate people should participate in juries more often?) True ethics and jurisprudence cannot afford such facile confidence. There is an insidious equation of law with justice. Every true legal mind, knows that the letter of the law can overwhelm the spirit of the law. Justice is just too big a topic for a movie!  I fear it takes on more than it can handle. But what a worthy effort!"
greenpyro1,"Apr 20, 2012",1/10,I'm one who likes to look at IMDb and watch some movies based on ratings from this site. This one is probably the most overrated movie I have ever seen.People who are rating this movie great are just trying to impress you with the fact that they watched something that came out before they did. Seriously awful waste of time here. If you want a good older movie watch Treasure of the Sierra Madre or Casablanca or just about anything else over this.I try to find good in everything and I just don't get why people give this one such a high rating. Nothing great about it. Boring as hell and not one thing good worth mentioning. Because of IMDb i had high expectations and boy am I rethinking this sites reviewers.
faizzkhan-38433,"Feb 9, 2020",8/10,Yes it is proved that a movie make in a single jury room ok fine every thing is well nothing is bored to us pardon me for i give less credit to the artists of this movie but the man who write the dialogues for this movie have a salute by my side who wrote these type of tremendous dialogue for a continuous movie which never make us bored for a single time... absolutely this is called a classic of an age...!
gustavobotello,"May 1, 2020",9/10,"The entire dilemma of the movie seems to be very simple to solve, but the movie embodies the spirit of what it means to ""be responsible with our decisions.""
A deep touch to the common citizen who only watches over his time without consider how much a simple conjecture means for the rest of the people."
orhcam,"Dec 10, 2016",10/10,"I am recommending this movie to be watched in my business life. You can see all kind of demonstrations of different type of characters and behaviors affecting decision taking and process.You can see how people are changing their minds and and getting influenced by others. Another important part of the movie is you can see how the people can react to the same topic by coming from different culture, education, priorities and mindset can influence or being influenced by others. There are so many techniques have been used to demonstrate all these and the outcomes of these are also showing ın a very simple way. I definitely recommend you to watch this extraordinary movie you will enjoy it."
ji-64500,"May 28, 2020",10/10,"The story is not complicated. How to confront eleven strangers with one man in such an awkward and even unconstrained situation requires not only the ability of speech, but also the ability of rational analysis. In addition, the director also set up twelve characters of different professions and classes to promote the plot."
isemmanuelolowe,"Jan 1, 2021",10/10,A film you need to see before you die. You could never think a film based entirely in 1 location could be so suspenseful and impactful.
ameenisapoohead,"Jun 5, 2017",10/10,"This film is nothing short of perfection. I don't want to do a huge review so I'll sum up why it's so brilliant.Great actors Great believable script Very original concept Shot cleverly (lack of close ups unless it's really necessary. Because the effect isn't used much, it is more effective) No complaints or plot holes of any kind.I encourage anyone to watch this film!"
mbhgkmsgg,"Nov 17, 2020",10/10,"Perfect. That's what 12 Angry Men is. Perfect. There isn't a thing about this movie I didn't love. The tension, the pacing, the room they're in, the acting, the filming, the directing, it's all perfect. Quite frankly, I'm a little mad that I hadn't seen this film sooner.The thing that stuck out to me perhaps the most was the pace and tension. Often, especially with older films, the pace tends to be relatively slow compared to more recent films. Yet, 12 Angry Men never slows down. There isn't a dull moment to be had. The only break we as the viewer get is when the jurors take their bathroom breaks. And even then, the conversations and debate continue. I personally love films that never ease on the pace and tension, and this one certainly doesn't.I also loved the pacing in terms of the story. The way information was revealed to the viewer in these deliberate increments made me get on the edge of my seat and stay there until the film ended. I was, of course, on the side of Juror #8 from the get-go, so I was always rooting for him to get his view through. But that doesn't mean that I would deny the fact that the opposing side made great arguments as well. As such, I was constantly waiting for what the counter-arguments from both sides would be.For a film about 12 men sitting in one room debating about their decision as a jury, 12 Angry Men is incredibly tense. And without that tension, this film wouldn't work. The reason, I believe, this film is so tense, is because the viewer is just as torn about the case as the jurors. The constant barrage of opposing views, both giving strong arguments, make it difficult to make up your mind. Just as much as it is a film about human nature and how opinions and preconceived ideas can affect our thinking, it's a film that forces the viewer to tackle these problems personally.12 Angry Men blew any expectations that I might have had right out the window. No matter how many great things I had heard, I never expected it to be so fantastic, and quite frankly perfect. I loved that it happened on the hottest day of summer and everyone was sweating. I loved that as soon as it started raining the fan started working. And I loved that it stopped raining as soon as they left the court building.
To put it simply, I loved everything about this film."
Srdic,"Oct 28, 2017",N/A,"One of the most favorite old movies. Psychological thriller that confuses you to the extreme because you do not know whom to trust, who to love, hate, condemn. A rich description of human nature on the screen, a psychology guide. For me, the greatest experience in this movie was to see how different types of characters influence one another, while the real action (to judge) becomes secondary,"
bas_salem,"Dec 30, 2014",3/10,"I can believe this movie take long time in same room and have a lot of details the the actors weren't convincingand we cannot know about these case more than what they say so it's boring.Especially when you have see it in the class and do argument about it!

colddale,"Nov 29, 2018",10/10,"Stellar performances, razor sharp pacing. A beautifully crafted exposition of bias, bigotry and hatred with a voice of reason confronting those attitudes.
I would recommend this film to anyone unreservedly."
LilyRessler,"Jun 3, 2023",10/10,"I highly recommend the film12 Angry Men (1957), a character study of twelve men charged with deciding the verdict in a death-penalty murder case.12 Angry Men is a good story that began life as a stage play. However, I find it difficult to believe any stage production could be as affecting as this film. For example, the movie is in black and white, which is not possible in a stage play. And although most of the movie takes place in a small jury room, the camera meets the challenge and then some: we see human nature up close and personal.IMHO the movie is a masterpiece and a must-see for any cinephile."
lomaxandy-74504,"May 19, 2019",10/10,"This, my friends! Is a film that is in my top favorites of my favorite films of all. I find it to be one of the best dialogue films ever because the film has no action to make it intense, it is the words that all of the 12 jurors speak to each other, especially with Henry Fonda that has to convince all the other jurors that the kid wasn't guilty and it is amazing how it is done in the film with an amazing script, dialogue and performances. I highly recommend it! It maybe a talking movie, but I promise you will not be bored one bit! Go see it!"
lortkipanidze,"Mar 16, 2017",10/10,this is an amazing movie with amazing casting and directing. i was kind of lazy to watch it because i thought it was too old but i really didn't regret it. I saw myself in all of those 12 men and every detail was perfect. i have seen its play(which is called 12 angry men too) and i totally suggest to go to check it out in theater . Amazing movie.one of my favorite ones.10/10
isikfurkan59,"Jan 3, 2022",10/10,"A movie that takes place indoors and makes you dream by including you in the movie, along with the characters in the movie, our doubts and impressions change, sometimes we even get bored as they do, and as a result, we question our competencies and think why we are the decision maker. It should definitely be watched and even taught as a lesson in some schools."
maverick-29364,"Jun 11, 2021",9/10,"In a Hollywood oversaturated with Star Wars, Jurassic Park, and superhero movies, the idea of a talented small group making a movie on a budget, sounds mortifying. 12 Angry Men proves not only that it can be done, but it can make one of the best films ever.The movie begins with a judge telling 12 jurors to decide the fate of an accused boy. Then the 12 jurors go to a room to discuss the trial. And after they decide the boys fate the movie ends. Get a cast and crew of 20 talented people, and you can make it yourself.The jurors discuss at length the events of the trial, as well as the crime which lead to it, all without any flashback scenes. When I first heard of it, I was worried it was going to be boring, but with strong performances from all jurors, great camera work, and a compelling case, I found myself under the trance of this masterpiece.It's not always a comfortable movie. The jurors are constantly yelling, the camera is claustrophobic, and the characters get sweaty, and it captures the jurors just perfectly. The case was interesting enough to begin with, but as new evidence presents itself, the film constantly gets more fascinating as it progresses.12 Angry Men is a film with a story to tell and it doesn't need a huge budget to tell it. I highly recommend, especially to the filmmakers of the future."
blacknet88,"Jun 23, 2019",10/10,"I enjoyed watching the movie a lot.
The film is filmed in a small room where 12 men are discussing the murder of a young boy.
While this issue is unimportant to all people and they want to end and return to their jobs, one man is trying to persuade others to be unimportant about the lives of an innocent person.
The film wants to show that everything does not look as it seems. With a little bit of patience and thought we may get better results."
RyanCShowers,"Aug 1, 2013",N/A,"Eighth grade was my first exposure to 12 Angry Men. My class was reading it as a play, I read the lines of juror number eleven. Shortly after the conclusion of our class read, we watched the film adaptation. I was in eighth grade, I knew it was a great film, but I didn't understand the brilliance of it that I see today. 12 Angry Men's greatest creative strength is the direction- technically. Sidney Lumet has every shot in every scene fitting together creating an effortless flow for the film. However, the greatest weakness the picture has is its hard for the viewer to really settle their inner roots in the it for some reason. The directing doesn't transport our emotions until the second half of the film.The Good Wife produced en episode in their first season titled Doubt. In a show that studies a defense attorney's efforts to create doubt in a jury's mind, the process of the jury members consolations are shown. I thought it was a brilliant move and we should see more media centric things about juries. That episode glimmers with inspiration from 12 Angry Men, but it lacks the morality, mystery, and humanity found in the play. People mistake character development for spending mass amounts of time with a particular character. I believe character development is to I understand a character, the writing and actor thoroughly explain the person on the page to me. 12 Angry Men develops twelve characters in ninety minutes without even knowing their names.As each juror slowly changes their verdict in 12 Angry Men, near the middle of the film I was struck, seeing a metaphor occurring mid-film. It all goes back to politics, the jurors willing to believe that the boy on trial is innocent are the liberals and the men who close their mind to any possibility of innocence represent the conservative party. The jurors who may have been judged for the way they talk, what ethnicity they are, their sexual orientation, or if they were just plain old sensitive were the ones who opened their minds up to Juror 7's campaign to examine the case thoroughly. Now 12 Angry Men still lives back in the days where life was religion-centric and things were one way, and one way one only. This is a move that makes 12 Angry Men ahead of its time.12 Angry Men is a slice to how a jury actually acts to some extent. The thing they always forget, when their minds are clouded with things in their life they are missing due to their obligation to the justice system, is they hold the fate of another man's life. It's not something that can be taken lightly. Reasonable doubt is mistaken with something that proves the accused not guilty. That's not true and 12 Angry Men shines a light on that discussion. What this film is about to me is the laziness, selfishness, and our personal bias hiding our judgment. We all need to take a step back sometimes and really look at the situation for the gray, not black or white. Even laughing here and there, 12 Angry Men is something that may not be the most fun film to watch, but it's certainly an important to see.Rating: 9/10Grade: A"
govtmule-94509,"Jun 16, 2024",1/10,"First thing the defendant was guilty in ""12 Angry Men,"". However, this movie exposes the huge flaws in the jury system. Even when evidence and testimony supports a guilty verdict a single self-righteous bully swayed the decisions of other jurors,Juror 8 is portrayed as a champion of justice, but his methods of jury tampering by introducing an identical knife and speculating on witness testimonies, steps beyond courtroom protocols. He dismisses the old man's account and makes assumptions about the female witness's eyesight all based on personal experiments and conjecture, not verified evidence.Juror 8's tactics and amateur detective work, created bias on the jury with emotional appeals rather than sticking to the trial facts, and undermining the judicial process. Thank goodness this movie is a fictional, account using dramatic license, and should not be taken as a real case study."

Khumi1809,"Feb 6, 2017",10/10,"12 Angry Men is a great movie I am a big fan of classics genre I can confidently say that this by far the most unique film I have ever seen. Although people of my generation we tend to watch modern films but I have a special place in my heart for classics as well, It was when I surfed around the Internet looking for something good to watch. Then I stumble upon this title '12 Angry Men' I didn't think of it as much so I thought I will just give it a try. As it started I have to be honest I wasn't paying much attention first but as the movie progressed I kind of got engaged to the whole argument the men were having from that point I got sucked in to the film. I like the way it is viewed as a first person while making the experience more interactive. I fear I might as well never see a film as spotless as this one as we modern viewers like to point out mistakes, goofs or spoofs but this movie is pretty close to perfection totally recommend to anyone who likes to see cinema from a whole new perspective."
LawrenceofAsia,"Feb 5, 2022",10/10,Great scripts. Lots of tensions due to good acting and Lumet's use of different lens. Good turns and twists in the process of investigating the evidence.

GREAT MOVIE."
JEBaeza,"Jul 16, 2023",8/10,"I can't believe I was hooked for every second of such a simple movie. I didn't know what to expect going into the film, I just knew it is always on top of the rankings of the best movies of all time. I was pleasantly surprised that a movie with no action at all, no mind-bending plot, and what could seem like a very boring setting, could have me so invested and on the edge of my seat. The film flows perfectly and makes you feel as if you are there, like you are Juror #13 trying to come up with arguments to convince everyone else. One thing I liked a lot is that every juror has a strictly unique personality, and can only be convinced in a specific way. But what puts that movie up there for me is that you never know if the kid was or wasn't guilty. Throughout the movie, Juror #8 remarks that it is possible to be right or wrong, and with the information they have, nothing can be taken for granted. It ultimately comes to what is morally correct, having an innocent kid killed or letting a murderer out in the streets. It makes you realize how easily can people, who have nothing to win or lose, go over important details when there's a lot at stake. A true classic."

floodbYte,"Jun 5, 2022",7/10,"This movie is pretty brilliant. It is so simple and neat with one simple concept. It is not too long so it never get's boring. Small almost incignificent changes in the movie makes it interesting. And at the same time you are finding out more about the entire murder case, and how racism and sterotypes can break a good democracy. I really do like the touches like how the camera zooms in gardually over time. With really nice actors with somewhat conving diolog it makes you want to watch till the end.It's simply brilliant. But it doesn't have anything to make it exciting or something that I would want to watch again, or being able to watch over and over again. But I do understand that some people really like this movie, hard to explain."
jromanbaker,"Feb 15, 2023",3/10,"I have tried, and tried again to like this film. But I fail after the first fifteen minutes. For a start it is a Henry Fonda vehicle based on a television play. And sadly it still looks like and feels like a television play. The line up of actors like Ed Begley, Lee J. Cobb etc is impressive and they act well if over theatrically. Fonda is Fonda and I repeat he is the star and he does his best to shrug off his usual coldness on film. I have nothing against his acting except that I do not respond to his way of performing. A little more warmth, and being less dour I would perhaps, and it is a big perhaps, to respond to him better. So this for me is one of the fault lines in the film and his stabbing a knife on the table is a great moment. Being a big star the moment has tremendous impact, and no doubt most audiences are caught. As for the plot of the film it is about a youth who has to all intents committed a murder and twelve jurors debate about his going to the electric chair or not. I know it was 1957 and just maybe it was too daring to ask but no one questions capital punishment in itself, and twelve angry men could dispute that in itself but of course it is not on the table. The film is often praised for its camera movements, claustrophobic towards the end and less so at the beginning. The only unintended humour for me was one of the more elderly men taking too long in the toilet. Or bathroom in ' respectable ' terms and the latter is of course used. No spoilers to the ending. But with signposts all the way a child could work it out. I also have not read in any reviews of this ' great ' film that the jurors are all baying for blood, and to get out of the room on a hot day as soon as possible. My opinion is I know a minority one, but for me the film does not dare to even question the biggest of all basic and human issues and that is if capital punishment is right or wrong in itself."
goodarzvandp,"Feb 2, 2022",10/10,What a perfect movie. A person who uses logic tools to tame ignorant and angry people. This shows the importance of conversation and having the knowledge of eloquence.

mikelino-18936,"May 26, 2020",10/10,"A movie with 12 men, one room, one case, one boy, one murder and one life at stake.
The movie is the definition of creating something huge with so little.
The character developement is a study case on its own and the moral lessons of standing up against the mass, the jury's and citizen's responsibility, the tackling of rasicm, the principle of reasonable doubt, innocence until proven guilt and burden of proof are uniquely captured and conveyed in the form of a dialogue, when 12 men seek the truth so as to come to a verdict.
The self evident value of human life as the ultimate value in our society is always interwoven with the unfolding of the story throughout the movie while a stellar cast and a startling director turns this movie into a mesmerizing masterpiece."
emircin,"May 22, 2022",9/10,"A production that answers the questions of what is justice and how should justice be done.A masterpiece that every lawyer should watch.Although it is old, it does not bore at all and is the type to be watched in one breath until the end."
JohnWelles,"Jun 8, 2009",10/10,"Sidney Lumet's ""12 Angry Men"" (1957) has me laughing out-loud every time I see it. This is not because I dislike the film, but because the director makes it seem so easily done, it makes you think you could do it yourself. The acting is a complete dream. Henry Fonda, E. G. Marshall, Martin Balsam and Robert Webber are exceptional. But the real star of the film is Lee J. Cobb. He immense's himself so completely into his role that its hard to believe that the movie isn't a documentary. The ending of the film, with that look on Lee J. Cobb's face is heart rendering. Lumet's directorial debut (he had been previously in TV) is as remarkable as Orson Welle's in ""Citizen Kane"". A brilliant piece of film making."

This film stands out from most of the rest in the ""old film"" department. Filled with amazing acting (Fonda's and Cobb's stood out to me in particular), brilliant writing, and its creative use of just very few movies sets, 12 Angry Men is a movie I'd watch again and again, capturong each layer of a message that shows that even when the odds seem entirely against you, there's always a chance."
elsinefilo,"Feb 14, 2006",N/A,"Here's a film made only in a room that looks hot and humid and only on a budget of $349,000. The twelve jurors must decide unanimously on a case of first degree murder whether the accused is guilty or not guilty. When they walk into a jury room which is both hot and humid they become acquainted with the personalities of their peers at first.Then they do a vote with the motive of finishing that taken-for granted murder case.However right at that moment they realize that one of the jurors doesn't like the quick open and shut situation of the case and he says ""it needed to be talked"" based on his reasonable doubt! Because it's not an unanimous voting the case need to be talked then a whole set of serious arguments ensues.Sifting of the evidence disclose the errors of the prosecution's case, the doubtful representation by the defendant's court-appointed attorney, and the true inner-deep character of each of the jury members.Well that's what I love just a room twelve people..one man a lone dissenter force the others to think why they vote yes why they don't no.He forces them to share a responsibility and he is even tactful enough to mention that the accused kid has been subjected to violence..that he needs more than just a fair-looking trial before sending him to the chair.Henry Fonda as the cool,calm and wise questioning one dissenter is just awesome the other 11 days are good too but Joseph Sweeney as the wise and observant elderly man named McCardle caught my attention too! Last but not least the run-time of the is about 90 minutes so after getting engaged in 90 minute of fighting arguments you feel like you have watched a game where the winner is humanity of course!"
kh-lodi-93,"Jan 1, 2015",7/10,"First of all, we agree this's old movie. This movie was produced more than fifty years. We can't comparing this movie with any movies made after 2000C or 1980.Second, I didn't like it. Because in first part I felt bored. Just 12 men tolling shot story and make it long. All of them was in one location. It's a small room for all of times with a lot of sweating :). Anyway, I saw this movie in Mr. King class. I think he liked this movie to much. I saw him passion when he a play it to us in our class. But when he do it again and again I see a good part of all parts in this movie. It's a story. I think we lost this kind of stories in modern movies. 4C"
KIFulgore,"Jul 6, 2001",1/10,"I cannot believe I was forced to endure this movie in a class I took at college.  Synopsis:  12 men sit in a room and talk for the ENTIRE movie. It's about as fun as sitting in the doctor's office listening to the chit-chat of other patients.  I know it's supposed to be good since it has the noble purpose of pointing out the already obvious fact that some accused people, if the jury does not consider carefully all the evidence, will be wrongly convicted.  Also, some of the ""evidence"" presented to defend the accused is sketchy, at best.  It seems too many jurors have taken this movie to heart -- in this country we turn people like O.J. Simpson out on the street.I might have liked to read this as a book, where I could at least dream up my own characters and give them more to do besides sit and talk.  The two main characters were also pretty flat; one is your all-enlightened bleeding heart liberal who thinks a crack dealer that has been arrested 42 times will straighten up if given ""just one more shot at 'rehab'.""  The other is the typical conservative loudmouth whose values are rock-solid and self-righteous and he's going to scream louder and louder until you agree with him.  This movie isn't suspensful, it's laughable.Rating:  2/10"
txicc,"May 2, 2020",9/10,"The plot unfolds well, but the part Davis advocates is only vague speculation. In fact, after proving these things one by one, the child may or may not be the murderer. It's just that the initial work of the prosecution has not been done well, the cross examination of the defense has not been done well, and the case should be investigated again, rather than simply acquitted. It's a great honor to see someone take a screenshot and quote this short comment 11 years ago as a vulgar mass representative. Now I would like to add that it is one thing to say that the dereliction of duty by the organs of power. There is no fault in reasonable questioning, but there is a fault in the verdict of acquittal. Because no matter whether the masses are blind followers or male masters, they are just crushed. Literary and art youth criticized me for pursuing the truth and vulgarity. So long as it is contrary to the institutional view, is it fair and just to accept the innocent result."

There are a few wonderful courtroom dramas out there, Anatomy of a Murder, To Kill a Mockingbird and Witness for the Prosecution immediately springing to mind. 12 Angry Men is so brilliant, it could very well be the definitive courtroom drama on film. Sidney Lumet's direction is masterly, and although the action takes place on one set(an actual New York drawing room) there are a huge variety of innovative camera angles and visual set-ups."
Lk1990,"Jun 15, 2020",9/10,"This film to me was simply about standing up for what you believe in, even if the majority are against you. Henry Fonda's character, Davis, stands lonesome against 11 men in a battle that will determine another young mans life. As the story moves along you as the viewer are compelled to the minority's side as are the other men around Davis.
I was enthralled the whole way through and believe it is still, even 63 years on, worth a watch. It is still as educational today as it was in 1957. Fantastic performances and heart wrenching dialogue, this one is a true classic."
AlyElsiginy,"Aug 7, 2022",9/10,"I'm not really a fan of black & white movies, and not really interested in a movie which's summed up in only one set of location. So I had doubts in planning to watch it in first place. However, it turned out the complete opposite. Actors' amazing performances and the dialogues which involved rage, panic, confusion, and switches of emotions, had to require a lot of efforts and talent from the actors. Which they give their all for it. I'd recommend this movie to everyone, most importantly for its great scenario, and actors' performance, and being joyful to watch for the complete duration."
rdoyle29,"Sep 9, 2017",10/10,"There's some interesting alchemy going on in this film. While it's extremely realistic in it's look and attention to detail, it's a highly stylized and somewhat mechanical film. All the characters are clearly defined by the single aspect they bring to the scenario and they interact more like types than real people. The story doesn't show you what's on it's mind, it flat out tells you by putting the parts of it's thesis into the mouths of the characters. None of this really matters though because between it's exceptional cast and Lumet's masterful direction. what you get is a finely tuned machine of a film that's the best film ever made of it's kind. Fonda specialized in playing the voice of middle-class intellectual liberalism in the early 60's and it's largely because of his performance here."

It is based on a very sensetive issue of human society which makes it timeless.On the other hand, the movie is really old, some of the acting is bad and the camera and angles could have been better. It's the type of act you would prefer to see in a theatre instead."
