trelloskilos-1,"Dec 18, 2004",10/10,"Cidade de Deus seems to have a lot of praise on the IMDb boards, and with good reason too. It simply is, in my opinion, one of the best contemporary films ever made.Based on true events and characters who live in the overlooked and poverty stricken slums in the shadows of Rio de Janiero, where life expectancy doesn't reach the 30's and drug dealers are kings.The tale of the City of God, and its myriad of characters is told by Rocket, a young man who struggles to make something of his life, other than to wind up another victim of drugs or gang wars.Not only are the characters in City of God absolutely fascinating, and also very endearing, but also convincingly acted by groups of young and unknown actors. The stoies are well-told, and at times, funny, and at others, brutally shocking.The cinematic style of the film gives a nod to Tarantino, with some clever time-jumping, freeze-framing, and texts indicating another chapter of the film. In every sense, a bit of a Brazillian ""Pulp Fiction"" or ""Goodfellas"", but with its own unique flavour to it.The City of God is a marvel, and a highly recommended film to watch, but not recommended for the over-sensitive or easily distressed."
ragin_kagin,"Nov 28, 2004",10/10,"The film revolves around the, 'City of God,' a favela (or ghetto) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, a horrifying area where drug dealers run the community, and where children killing children is not an uncommon occurrence.The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children.The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all.10/10, A+Would also recommend: Bus 174 and Carandiru"
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 10, 2017",10/10,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly.Overall, a masterwork. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
panjshir_lion,"Mar 30, 2005",10/10,"I have seen this movie only recently (2005) and it's easily one of the better foreign films I have seen. Actually, it's probably just about one of the best films I had ever seen.The characters really make this movie come alive with each of their compelling personalities shining though in the backdrop of oppressive conditions and constant violence. One thing which clearly comes to mind is ""Lil' Dice's"" ear to ear smile - so vivid and yet so ironic since he personifies pure evil.The City of God is a world you don't want to visit, it won't be featured on a post card, and it's said to be the city ignored by god himself. This movie makes you feel uncomfortable, puts you on the edge of your seat -- you are right into the middle of the City and you too are caught up in it's violent temptation. More importantly, it's about the triumph of the human spirit against all odds.This movie in effect is fast paced and hard to follow (with the added stress of subtitles over Portuguese), but it's worth it; and in fact really adds to the impetuous and impulsive undertones of the movie. In addition, the quintessential Brazilian music blending into the film like a well made Caprahina makes it feel authentic like the Italian music in the God Father.You see the flaws of these men played out in an almost fatalistic nature -- hated, greed, futility; and in it all we see ourselves, our own flaws, and our own condition."
ElChivoDave,"Jan 8, 2003",10/10,"The film, directed by Fernando Meirelles, tells the story of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, in an area known as the Cidade De Deus, the City of God.  The story is told from the narration of the young photographer, Rocket.  The different scenarios of life that make up the wider-story are presented in Pulp Fiction style chapters, complete with on-screen titles for each different story component.  The story covers all the facets of the life, charting the growth of several key members of the gangs from childhood through to young adulthood, with their transformation from young hoodlums to local drugs barons.  The final parts of the story focus on the battle within the Cidade De Deus between two different groups, when business and personal matters lead to an unavoidable confrontation.  And what a confrontation it is, although details will not be given away here.  The result is a powerful telling of life based around real-life events.Martin Scorsese seems to have a heavy influence on the direction of this picture, with many moments looking familiar to fans of the legendary American filmmaker.  Close ups, sweeping scene shots, freeze-and-zoom shots, and a frenzied handheld approach are all trademarks that will be recognisably traceable to Scorsese, having been used throughout his career. Many shots remind the viewer of Scorsese's narrative dialogue-camera relationship in Goodfellas, in which the camera was used to brilliant effect to highlight the main points in the script.  This technique is used heavily in the first twenty minutes of Cidade De Deus, with the freeze frame trick being used to introduce the story's main characters alongside the dialogue of narrator, Rocket.Throughout the film one cannot help but watch a scene and think, 'I've seen that in Raging Bull, Goodfellas, or Casino', and this may make some look less favourably on the film's direction.  However, it is not fair to consider this 'a Brazilian Goodfellas', as one critic has observed.  The story has parallels - the underlying ideas of gangsters, drugs and violence -, the direction is similar, and the story is told with narration, much like Ray Liotta's role in Scorsese's epic.  But to regard this film in terms of what styles it repeats or nods it's hat to, is to be very ignorant. Fernando Meirelles,  has done a wonderfully hypnotic job of blending the old styles, and bringing them up to date with flashy and sometimes dangerously kinetic direction and editing.  Look only to the leaving-party scene in which strobe lighting is used to extraordinary effect, almost suffocating the story below a bombardment on the visual senses.  Think of a crossover between the visual energy of the Matrix and the violence of the club scene in Bad Boys.Cidade De Deus is much more than a directorial assault on the senses.  As Raul Walsh said if you don't have a story you have nothing, and many flashy Hollywood films have fallen short in using 'ultra-modern' direction to disguise the fact that no substantial story exists underneath.  Cidade De Deus is most brilliant in that it combines directorial and editorial brilliance with a story that is almost second to none in recent times. Only the true greats manage to cater to these two needs of cinema, and this is one that does.  The direction is amazing, but not to disguise the story flaws, and the story is brilliant, but does not overwhelm directorial originality.  But simply, Cidade De Deus is a perfect film for avid fans of cinematography, and those just in search of two hours of a bloody good story.I cannot decide yet if I would consider this better than Amores Perros, but it is certainly not inferior.  The at-the-same-time stylish and brutal visuals of Amores Perros are replaced by a grittier, more hands on approach to the subject.  Whilst in Amores Perros the characters took precedent, in Cidade De Deus the location is as big a character as those who live there. As a result we get a much greater feeling of the environment in which the characters exist, and so it is perhaps easier to empathise, and/or sympathise with them.  As the official press synopsis says, Cidade De Deus is a character, but is a place not a person.  Amores Perros triumphs in creating relationships between the audience and the characters, as it concentrates for a long time on relatively few people, each of whom we grow to know and ultimately care about, which is important for the emotional impact of the film.  Cidade De Deus deals with dozens, even hundreds, of characters, and so it is only a minority that we become attached to.  This means that while the film leaves a lasting impact we are not left with the same inquisitiveness about the future for the characters that we meet in Amores Perros.  Both films leave open ends, but Cidade De Deus feels closed. Whether you consider this a good or bad thing is a matter for personal choice.Cidade De Deus is essential viewing, and is cinema at its most brilliant. It will of course feel the wrath of critics who will dwell on the almost unimaginably high body count, but there are always those who will reject violence in the movies.  In fact the violence in Cidade De Deus, even the apocalyptic ending, is not as raw and bloody as many will expect.  Blood spilling is a rare sight, and the violence rests mostly, but not always, on choreography rather than in your face bloodshed.  The result is violence, but it is often so artistic that it looks beautiful rather than deterring. Like Scorsese's Taxi Driver the violence is abhorrent, but admirable from a cinematic perspective.In short, this is a superb achievement, and is easily one of the best films of the year, and of the decade so far.  Like it's predecessors, this is the latest film to come out of South America that indicates the emergence of major new talent in filmmaking.  Hollywood beware."
janicenichols-32565,"Sep 28, 2018",9/10,I agree with the other positive reviews here. I just saw this again after 15 years - still far exceeds anything made today when it comes to struggles of troubled youth in urban slums plagued by drugs and violence. So raw. So shocking to the system. Highly recommended!
sarahdelore,"Jun 7, 2003",10/10,"I knew nothing of this film before I saw it by chance in a rare Pub open screening, but boy was I glad I got the chance to take a look. I was riveted all night - I completely ignored my friends! I thought it was an awesome re-enactment of a true story - powerful, moving, raw, real - and even funny in parts. I walked away afterwards, beaming. It's rare a great film like this is made, especially these days. I gave it ten out of ten. Please see it if you can."
SnoopyStyle,"Jun 16, 2015",8/10,"Li'l Zé and his gang is having fun chasing a runaway chicken in a Rio favela called the Cidade de Deus ""City of God"". The chicken comes to Rocket with his camera. Then flashbacks to the 60s tell the story of Rocket who becomes the photographer of his friends. Li'l Zé and his best friend Benny grow up to be the crime boss of the city. There's Carrot who is a criminal leader tolerated by Benny and there's Knockout Ned who turned away from crime.It is truly a new Godfather. It is the harsh brutality of the slums. It's the randomness of the world. It beats with a human heart. It's a little messy. It's visceral. The kids are played by kids. The criminals are remorseless. The amateur actors are authentic. The cinematography is terrific. The location can't get more real. It is a new crime masterpiece."
ccthemovieman-1,"Mar 6, 2006",8/10,"Wow, this is one of those different movies - meaning not run-of-mill by any means - and one of those which isn't pleasant to watch but one you might find yourself mesmerized by it.This also is one of those ""based on a true story"" films which makes it even more shocking, if its mostly true. The story is of the many young (pre and early-teen) criminals inhabiting an area just outside the big city of Rio de Janeiro in Brazil. It has the feel of a documentary with real-life street kids but is upgraded considerably by fantastic camera-work, some very innovative cinematography. In other words: stylish.Make no mistake: without that stylish look, the film might be too much of a downer. The street kids are interesting but really brutal, so be prepared. I mean, how often do you see 12-year-old killers portrayed on film? The violence, language and drug use are rough in here and what a sad comment on this social problem in Brazil, a country with a huge problem with these street gangs. Overall, a very tough but fascinating film."
jpisani-1,"Dec 15, 2004",10/10,"I am a big fan of foreign film, because its great to see directors with different points of view than the average American director. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It shows the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a brand new way. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Weather your a Harvard intellectual or the local idiot, you can enjoy this. The vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with haunting accuracy. It even forces the audience to sympathize with some of the nastiest thugs in the world. All in all, City of God is one the greatest movies of my time and each time i watch it i enjoy it more than the last."
ma-cortes,"Oct 18, 2004",7/10,"The movie deals about children and adolescent factions in the impoverished Favelas , Rio Janeiro , for 1960 and 1970 years . And it centers upon a teen who tries to leave that world by means of the photography . The final confrontation among the motley gangs for Favelas control is pretty violent and bloody .In the motion picture there are shocks , emotion , sex , violence and a little bit of social criticism . Runtime film is overlong but it's fast moving and that's why it isn't boring but it results to be enjoyable . The picture is similar other film from 1981 : ¨Pixote¨ (Hector Babenco) that was likeness in atmosphere and showing the delinquent vagrants . It's a thought-provoking and clever studio of juvenile paupers and unflinching remark at the underbelly of Rio Janeiro city , where teens and children become into burglars and assassins . The movie was not actually shot in Cidade De Deus slum as it was too dangerous ; it was shot in a neighbouring , less dangerous área . Principal actors' interpretation is outstanding , in spite of most are newcomers . All of the amateur actors were recruited from Favelas (slums) in Rio de Janeiro, and a couple of them actually lived in the Cidade de Deus (City of God) itself . Fernando Mereilles direction is awesome and stylish , he even has been hired by Hollywood to make lavish films . The motion picture had an Oscar nomination and obtained a lot of success at box office around the world . The movie is produced by Walter Salles , the best director and production manager from Brazil .The film is rated ¨R¨ for crude murders and sex and isn't apt for boys , only for old people (+18) , neither squeamish. The flick will appeal to social drama and thoughtful films lovers . Rating: 7/10. Well worth watching."
michaelgs,"Nov 26, 2004",N/A,"I have made an effort to watch all the movies in IMDb's top 100 rated list. As of now, I'm looking for a place where the DVD for Sunset Blvd. is (currently at #30). But this movie is one of the movies I've seen that's on the list. And I find it an amazing film (currently #5 on my top 10 list). What I enjoy about this film is the visual look of the film, but also the way the director puts you in the story. At the end of the film you have become friends with just about everyone in the film, even though some of the characters are very despicable people. The violence hits you in the chest like a load of bricks sometimes, especially when you recognize that many of the kids involved in the violence are right around 10 or 11, but you also realize that this reflects the culture of the slum these kids live in.Gangster films always seem to make for good dramas (e.g. the Godfather, Goodfellas), where the culture of evil almost always triumphs as the dominant character. This film is no different, but it shows the life of children in places where bribery and corruption reigns supreme. It also shows the bravery of many of these people when even the government won't stick up for them.If you're thinking of starting to watch some foreign language films, this is a good place to start. It is a classic IMO among films made in languages besides English. I did find that the subtitles in this film were done rather poorly (they displayed on my DVD player at the wrong times and it took a few plays to figure out who was saying what.) But I think the film itself is a truly great film."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 5, 2023",10/10,"A no holds barred look at life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, a place that consumes many, but now and then, people escape and make good.It is an outstanding piece of cinema, I was told to watch it, that I would enjoy it, it absolutely blew me away.I would argue this film isn't for everyone, it's not a thriller of drama as such, it's too real for that, instead it's a detailed look into real life. It's not casual viewing, you need to concentrate, so ensure you have two peaceful hours to absorb it.Relentless, bleak, at times it's quite upsetting, if you're sensitive, this will leave a mark on you, several of the scenes which involve kids are quite hard to follow.Gun violence, drugs etc, it really doesn't hold back, it's graphic. The visuals for me are the film's best element, it looks terrific, it's very stylish.@The acting is terrific, especially when you consider the size of the cast, and the number of youths.10/10."
kosmasp,"Apr 2, 2007",9/10,"This movie does not take any prisoners. Although I have not been into any ""favella"" (= ghetto) and I don't really know if the movie depicts it realistically, I do know that it is a gripping story. About kids growing up in a violent environment. Not that this movie is an action movie. It's a drama, with action scenes in it.The style and the look remind you a little bit of a documentary, just to make things scarier/real. It fully achieves it's goal. The ""actors"" (the director mostly used people who really live or lived in Brazilian ghetto) are superb too. And since the story is well written and told, there is nothing more you could wish for. Of course if watch it in it's original version and don't speak Portuguese, than you will have to read the subtitles ... but it's more than worth it (and I personally prefer it that way)"
chengjeffrey99,"Oct 30, 2018",10/10,"Incredible film. Not much to say, yet I could say it all. The film is absolutely splendid in its use of colour, characters and especially music. Though some might complain of the shaky Super 16 footage, it is evidently for effect as the first half (golden age) is filmed with lots of aerials, and smooth, precise shots.Stunning in every sense"
moviesleuth2,"Jun 20, 2008",10/10,"Before anyone says anything, hear me out. According to the IMDb Top 250 list, ""The Godfather"" reigns supreme as number one, while ""City of God,"" or more appropriately, ""Cidade de Deus,"" is at the number 17 slot. But to compare the two is like comparing an Arnold Schwartzenegger movie to ""Crash."" They are just too different. But for me, while Francis Ford Coppolla's 1972 film is rightly considered a masterpiece, ""City of God"" is more memorable and packs a bigger punch. That, and ""The Godfather"" has had 30 more years under its belt to gather its legendary status. And it's in English (which, sadly, makes a lot of difference).Now, ""City of God."" What a rush! Fernando Meirelles's masterpiece is a film to behold. Many critics have described films as ""explosive"" for the punch they pack, and/or the unflinching reality of the subject matter. But there has been no film I have ever seen that can match ""City of God"" for energy. It has so much energy that instead of unfolding, it throws itself at you all at once, leaving everything else to be done afterwards. The actors don't act; they don't have time. They just...are. Everything is done to such an extreme, it's surprising that Meirelles manages to make none of it sensationalistic or exploitative.Some people will tell you that this film is the chronicle of two drug lords. While there is some truth in that, the plot, if one could call it that, is better described as the chronicle of the ""City of God"" itself. Characters float in and out, with the ""out"" part frequently involving a bang (or more likely, a series of them). The characters are given background only if and when they are needed.Like I said, there's really no time to develop subtly-nuanced performances. The film moves with such breakneck energy that to do so would only slow it down. There are only a few characters that really matter. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) is our window into the hellish slums. The result isn't voyeuristic, instead Rocket is more like a guide (albeit with only the narration addressing the audience). He's a normal teen, with interests in girls (particularly Angelica (Alice Braga)), sex, and aspirations to be a photographer. But his main goal is simply to survive each day. Also of note is Li' Ze, who we see growing up with a taste for violence as a kid (kids shoot and kill people just as frequently, if not more so, than adults). His increasingly drug-addled brain and his ambition makes him more frightening by the minute. The only one who keeps him grounded and (relatively) under control is Benny (Phellipe Haagensen), the ""coolest hood in the City of God."" There's some truth in that statement, as spoken by Rocket. He's the shed of brightness in this hellish city (though he's no goody-two-shoes). Finally, there is Lil Ze's rival, Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who has the film's most notable character changes.But this is Fernando Meirelles movie. He throws in everything he can think of, and then some. References to Tarantino are abound, and there are probably more, but Meirelles takes the energy level up so high that there's no room for even a ""please"" or ""thank you."" Desaturated colors. A constantly moving camera. Loud noises. An upbeat soundtrack (which is the film's saving grace from becoming too grim). It's all here.People may not agree with me that this is the best film ever made, and that's okay. I respect that. But make no mistake, it's an unforgettable 130 minutes."
claudio_carvalho,"Nov 1, 2003",10/10,"The story begins in the present days, in a barbecue party in the slum of 'Cidade de Deus', with some bandits chasing a chicken. Then, a teenager called Buscapé (Alexandre Rodrigues) tells the story of the Cidade de Deus and the main characters of the movie (Zé Pequeno, Bené, Cenoura etc.), since they were kids.This movie takes place in Cidade de Deus, a set of buildings originally built in the 60's for poor persons originated from a big flooding in Rio and from some slums. In the 60's, this area was isolated, without any infrastructure. Nowadays, with the construction boom, it is located close to Barra da Tijuca and Jacarepaguá, very valuables zones. Rio de Janeiro City is surrounded by slums, where the situation presented in the film is the reality of thousands and thousands of honest poor persons.This movie is remarkable: the screenplay, the direction, the performance of the cast, everything works perfectly. The frantic camera looks like a documentary. Today the DVD was released in Brazil, I bought it and I have just watched it with my family.I really can imagine the reaction of foreigners watching this sad side of Rio de Janeiro. It is strange, because a person who does not live in Rio probably may think that this movie exaggerates in some aspects. However, this is our reality. Lost bullets, robberies, violence is part of our day-by-day life. By the other hand, the same person may think that life in Rio 'stinks', and again it is not true. My city, like a golden coin, has two sides: heads and tails. If you can afford, you have wonderful places to live. But unfortunately, a great part of the population lives in slums, like the ones showed in this movie. The lack of perspective in life of the children, unemployment, ridiculous salaries, lack of education, lack of the faith, all of these factors contributes for the formation of the next generation of drug dealers and bandits. The traffic offers positions to the kids, like showed in this movie. And in the end, even when the 'grown-ups' are arrested or murdered, there is a bunch of children to occupy the spot. A sad social problem, but true. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Cidade de Deus"" (""City of God"")"
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 17, 2016",10/10,"Wow, what a great movie! I'd heard plenty about this low budget Brazilian gangster film before I got around to seeing it when it showed on television in the middle of the night, but I was fully prepared to be disappointed. Many times a film has been hyped up so much that it's a let down when I finally see it, but not so this one: CITY OF GOD is a tremendous film, a masterpiece in fact. In many ways it's like a lower budget, more realistic version of the classic gangster films made by the likes of Martin Scorcese and Guy Ritchie and in many places it equals the heights of those two directors at the top of their game.The film follows the misadventures of various, almost feral children as they attempt to eke out an existence and then a living as they grow up in a Rio de Janeiro slum in the '60s, '70s and '80s. The central narrator isn't a gangster at heart; all he wants is to become a photographer and yet he's caught up time and time again in the violence surrounding his drug-dealing friends. Particularly good is Leandro Firmino as Li'l Ze, a psychotic hood who becomes a gang leader and who thinks nothing of having kids executed if they dare so much as get in his way.The direction is top notch, with Fernando Meirelles employing hand cameras on more than one occasion, so that this has a vivid, on the street look to it. The editing is slick and sleek, the music fits the action perfectly, and almost every actor seems to fit his or her role like a glove. I'm trying to think of things to criticise, but there's nothing, really: the story drew me in, got me interested in finding out what happened to the characters, and before I knew it a good two and a half hours had gone by while I sat back and was lost in this film's world. Of course, it's a tremendously violent movie, unflinching in its depiction of violence against children, and one of the most hard-hitting films I've witnessed, so not for those who prefer family-friendly fare; but if you're up for it, this just might be one of the best, most realistic crime films ever made."
phoenix-ks,"May 4, 2005",10/10,"This movie is absolutely amazing! It is a cinematic tour de force. It is undoubtedly one of the top ten best movies ever made. Comparable to American masterpieces such as Goodfellas or Pulp Fiction. But it is its own unique film.It is based on a true story of one boys desperate attempt to survive and escape the city of god (the slums of Rio de Janeiro) a truly brutal and violent place. A place where murders, holdups, drugs, and criminals are commonplace.This film announces the presences of a truly talented filmmaker, Fernando Meirelles. He directs this film with a ferocious, frantic, intensity perfectly merging every aspect of the film. He uses many different filming tricks from split screen to freeze frame. Each one is used at exactly the right time for the exact right reasons.All of this combines to make an unforgettably perfect cinematic masterpiece that i highly recommend. 10/10 A++"
fabioslimma,"Nov 21, 2020",10/10,"""City Of God"" (Cidade de Deus) is the best Brazilian film of all time. Technically perfect in directing, cinematography, editing, soundtrack and cast. Realistic, violent, impactful, this film is cinema of the best quality"
Anijo,"Sep 11, 2007",5/10,"I finally got around to watching this much praised movie, and I can certainly understand why so many people have found it fascinating. It is very well done in a technical aspect, and it's easy to be seduced by the way it looks and the constant flow of action scenes, not very different from the efficiency of some glossy & clever commercial. It also shows a way of life and a part of the world that is not very well known to many outsiders, thereby invoking some sense of illumination. Unfortunately, looking beyond the interesting setting & the glossy surface there's not a lot to be found.In 'Cidade de Deus' we follow some dirt poor kids who live as brutal gangsters in a shanty town part of the Brazilian city Rio de Janeiro. The kids need money, so they steal, they deal in drugs and they kill. This is the basic plot for the movie. And then what, you may ask? Well, then there's  sadly, pretty much nothing more. What we get here is just a grim world contained within itself, where people perform a lot of horrible acts without really wondering why or thinking about any options or consequences. Now somebody could argue that this is actually the way that many people handle such savage situations, and so this movie is just portraying them in a realistic way. But even then, a filmmaker telling a dramatic story has many opportunities to put things into a broader context and he/she can make the choice to give the audience a more multi-layered view without embellishing anything. If you've seen something like the excellent TV mini-series 'The Corner' you know what I'm talking about.'Cidade de Deus' makes no attempt to explain why these kids don't have any other opportunities than a life of violent crime, so there's no real critique of the society that produces this horrible condition. Without even a glimpse of the reasons for this, you cannot give any real insight into the desperation that drives the characters to behave in the gruesome ways that they do. Instead it comes across as something that's inevitable and almost natural. Like wild animals eating each other, not because they're forced to by special circumstances that could be changed, but simply because it is their instinct. As we all know this will seldom apply to human beings since our existence is much more complex. Any such complexity is totally missing here. In addition there's not much effort made to show the devastating effects that drugs & brutality has on the human soul. Most of the times when something really awful happens in the story, like children becoming killers or getting killed, it's rapidly followed by some non-emotional scene with some cool music and flashy editing. There's no grieving for the victims, the movie is over 2 hours long & the director spends about 30 seconds of that time showing family members shattered by this unnecessary loss of life, which means there's no depiction of the deep sorrow & hopelessness that extreme poverty & violence creates. We get little or no reflection, just one gun-blasting action followed by another & then another. A lot of stuff for eyes & ears, less for hearts & brains.So 'Cidade de Deus' is a film that looks very good. But for me to agree with IMDb placing it among the top 20 ever made (we're talking higher than 'Citizen Kane', 'Apocalypse Now' & 'The Seventh Seal'), the director's ability to convey the depth of human beings should at least be equal to his flair for technical tricks & brilliance. This is truly far from the case here. I rate it 5/10 for the cinematography & editing and for showing a small piece of a harsh reality without blinders, but for me it felt more like an ordinary action movie than an epic masterpiece."
siriver,"Apr 26, 2004",N/A,"'What are you doing, you're just a kid?' ""I steal, I kill, I carry a gun, how can I be just a kid? I am a man.""Many who visit Brazil the first time, tend to view Brazilians as lacking serious ambition. They seem to party the night away, and appear to seldom work. The old joke about Brazilians is that they have breakfast at 2:00 in the afternoon.But such a narrow view does not take into account the fact that while we in America work to live, sweating away for pennies which the government steals at every turn, they in Brazil Live to Live. It is a different kind of living, a life that sambas with the vibrance of the swaying palm and the bounding drum. A life that understands that we are only on this earth for a cup of cafezinho, and we should have fun while we can before the end comes, but quick.But as the City of God also shows us, Brazilian life is often nasty, brutish and short. A certain degree of anarchy overshadows all the denizens of the film. But Director Fernando Meirelles takes a situation lacking definite boundaries and clear authority, and creates a framework, a structure, that of Gang Rule. The gang-members are not seasoned, old-time criminals like Fredo Corleone or even Tony Montana. Instead, they are a bunch of sweet-faced kids. No one is older than 25, partly because of choice, but mainly because no one lives past this age.On the surface, in this context, City of God is a coming of age story of two young people, a sort of Brazilian ""Angels With Dirty Faces.' One character escapes from the City of God, while the other succumbs to it.But when one scratches beneath, one finds the film a comment on the morally bankrupt City of God in Rio De Janeiro, and a mirror on Brazil itself. Far away from the party hopping, Travel and Leisure postcard perfect white beaches, is another world, one of marauding bands of displaced children.The most surprising thing about City of God is its references to American films. Most Brazilian films, as the films of all countries do, owe allegiance to their own particular cultural situation. Brazil owes a cultural debt to Europe (Portugal, Germany, Italy) and Africa. However, the United States has a far more distant cultural relationship to Brazil. That is where City of God triumphs to me an American film goer. It uses the chapter format made famous in Pulp Fiction and more recently, Kill Bill. It uses the familial structure present in Goodfellas. It uses the 'white-suit cool' present in Miami Vice and the Bacardi and cola ads from the preview before this very movie.The fact that City of God can be subtitled Grand Theft Auto: Sao Paolo, is not a surprise nor a mistake. The film is built like a video game in its use of random acts of violence. But the fluid perfect camera work and editing give way to a film with enormous contradictions. Contradictions as large and as vast as the noble country itself.Stylistically, the camera work does not conform to its premise as a gangster film. A gangster film never looked this good. It is as if the camera is released in the wide open beaches, and kicked around like one of Ronaldinho's headers. It starts on the sand and moves steadily across. It picks up on the story but then heads into the sun. It then leaves us, the film-viewer, with the most indelible image in years as we see Sonia Braga (A world icon and sex symbol of Brazil)'s niece, sitting on the sun-drenched coast putting her arm around another young boy. The innocence conveyed in this scene is something to behold. It literally takes your breath away.You see the slamming of different, competing themes. You see the subtlety and tranquility of the beach, smashed into scenes of battered youths dying on city streets. You see a wealth of hypnotic ambiguous images pulled together, much like the very Culture of Brazil itself."
denkixd51,"Oct 20, 2019",10/10,"This is just a masterpiece of story-telling, a movie made with love and passion from everyone involved, simply an amazing movie, go watch it, I just can tell you this: City of God is the best film of Latin America, possibly the best film of the decade, and definitely one of the best films ever made."
christokunz,"Jan 11, 2024",10/10,"Such an amazing film that deserves the accolades and acclaimed hype it's garnered. One of the best foreign language films there is and one of the best films personally seen recently, after a long time of being on my to see list but taking a while to get round to it due to being so busy and going through a difficult phase.Perhaps 'City of God' is not for everybody. It is not some audience members' idea of being entertaining, and is pretty unflinching, uncompromising and challenges the viewer. It does, with that being said, a superlative job bringing those qualities to life, and there are others, including myself, who judge films by what they set out to do rather than just wanting to be ""entertained"". There are many hugely entertaining films, while there are others that are clearly intended to be things other than entertainment and either are deep character studies, deliberate mood pieces and poignant dramas and shouldn't be denounced because of stereotypical views of what a film should be like.'City of God' is very well made, with some stunning and hard-hitting images, even if the budget is not high or enormous. It's all audaciously shot and edited with a lot of gritty atmosphere and sense of tension. The music fits well and has some haunting moments without being intrusive, while Fernando Meirelles's direction, particularly in the visual style, is superb.The story is not hard to follow, with lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness. In no way either does it glamorise crime and gives an unflinching view of gangland rivalry, provoking comparisons to Martin Scorsese and 'Goodfellas'.Alexandre Rodrigues and Leandro Firmino da Hora are fabulous in their roles and carry the film and their compellingly real characters adeptly."
FilmOtaku,"Oct 4, 2004",9/10,"There are many films that don't live up to the hype they are afforded, particularly modern day films. 'City of God', directed by Fernando Meirelles is not one of them. From the moment the film began until halfway through the closing credits, my eyes did not leave the television once. Based on a true story, 'City of God' spans two decades and is about rival street gangs in the town Cidade de Deus (City of God), just outside of Rio de Janeiro. The city is one where the government sends the 'unwanted' residents of Rio, so most of the inhabitants are homeless, criminal and/or dirt poor. The story is told through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who manages to stay on the outer fringe of the gangs, befriending some of the hoods, but not participating. What he discovers he wants to do is become a photojournalist, and begins to take photographs of his neighborhood. When he is in his late teens/early twenties, he goes to work delivering newspapers, when one of his photographs of the slum gang boss is discovered and published without his permission, putting his life in danger, but beginning his professional career.There are so many reasons why 'City of God' is compelling, but besides its stylish and flashy cinematography and brutally realistic script, the pacing of the film is unrelenting. Not one time did I check the clock to see how far along we were in the film, even though I was on a time constraint. From start to finish, Meirelles gives us a solid yet exciting film. Of course, since I had no idea it was based on real events, 'City of God' became that much more intriguing, especially when, during the closing credits we see actual news footage of some of the primary characters, and we can see how closely the film mirrored actual events.With a film like 'City of God' it is nearly impossible to convey why it is an excellent film because it is just seamless and well done in so many ways.All I can do is recommend the film to pretty much anyone who is looking for a good story and a great presentation. See this film. Now. 9/10--Shelly"
Xstal,"Dec 19, 2023",8/10,"In Rio de Janeiro tensions ferment, Li'l Dice to Li'l Zé shows great intent, building on shoulders of others, those he once thought of as brothers, taking hold of pastures new with pure torment. The favela is the place where war is raged, like a prison where the disparate are caged, where the currency's narcotics, with allegiances firmly fixed, the chances are you'll never get too aged. To tell the tale our navigator is called Rocket, skirts with trouble, keeps his head below the parapet, then a camera comes to hand, a chance to break out of this land, but there are those who will impose their will with threat.Still a great piece of filmmaking."
secondtake,"Jul 14, 2010",9/10,"City of God (2002)A broiling, gruesome, vivid, unforgiving submersion in the drug and crime world of a Rio de Janeiro barrio. You want to just say wow wow wow, it's so violent and awful, and yet the filming and acting, wow again, it's virtuosic and artful. On that most visceral level, there is no faulting a film with this kind of cinematic integrity.Questions start to rise by the last hour, however. In terms of the subject, you wonder, could it be so? Is life so apparently run by children with guns? Where are the older thugs, where are all the kids who aren't criminals, on and on? You come to realize this is a hugely partial view. That's okay, for sure--it's a movie--but it then draws attention to its own need for violence. You will never see so many people ruthlessly, heartlessly, even laughingly murdered, point blank, by children, on and on and on. This makes the movie awesome and awful, both. As a narrative story, it needs, it demands, greater complexity, and maybe, even if it's basically fiction, greater truth.On this level, the movie begins to depend on its energy to succeed. It has energy to spare, for sure, both in the acting, and in the camera-work, both of which are nothing short of unbelievable. But there is a lack, oddly enough with all these ""types"" of young men and boys, of actual ""character."" Where is some sense of the psychology behind so many of these people. Yes, the mood, the interactions, the scenes taken whole, the groups and even the confrontations leading (usually) to murder, all are filled with human depth. But the individuals seem largely to be types of people, not digging into their motivations and their inner states of mine. Maybe that's asking too much.I've seen the movie twice now, and twice I got anxious half way through because it was mostly kinetics and film-making on crack. And it really is astonishing stuff. But as with Slumdog Millionaire, the fractured and imaginative mise-en-scenes would mean so much more with deeper understanding of the human elements involved.A masterpiece, with some large chinks in its armor."
simonp81,"Sep 15, 2006",7/10,"I watched City of God a couple of years ago and was blown away on first viewing. I recently decided to watch it again the other night and was rather disappointed. Basically, COD is a massive case of style over substance - there's basically not much underneath the flashy exterior. For this film to be rated at number 18 in the top 250 is very hard to believe and I would presume that this is due to younger viewers being taken in by its easy charms (I'm only 24 myself though).On the positive side, the film looks amazing. The cinematography is beautiful, from the warm feel of the 'Tender Trio' story through to the bright colours of the later parts. The camera-work and editing are also first class and give the film a great immediacy, there are also some wonderful montages which really stick in my mind.The basic plot and milieu of the film is attractive, a potentially excellent base for a great film, but unfortunately it doesn't deliver. The most important problem with COD is a lack of any meaningful structure - the film simply doesn't 'go anywhere'. The only thematic development in the film is the perpetuation and escalation of violence to such a point that you just don't care anymore. I'm not sure how many killings there are in this film but it must getting on towards about 50, and the more this goes on the less impact it has. I understand that the film was making a statement about the 'reality' of life in a notorious favella - that violence is the norm - fine, make the point and move on, integrate the message into a meaningful piece of art. Instead the film just keeps on offering us another 'shocking' killing, and pays as little attention to these acts of violence as the thugs who commit them. Its overkill in more ways than one.The characterisation in COD is another one of its major downfalls. I just didn't care about any of them, or even have any basic interest in any of them (except maybe Lil Ze). The main character, Rocket, was a nobody in the City of God and also a nobody in the film, City of God. He hardly had any defining character traits - he was scared of guns and wanted to lose his virginity (this basically puts him on the same level as Scooby Doo who was scared of stuff and liked sandwiches - but at least Scooby is funny!). Rocket is dull, he is not funny, not cool, has no passion, little emotion - there's just nothing to care about in him, and the actor playing him fits the part perfectly. I felt that the best character in the film was Lil Ze, mainly because the actor did a pretty decent job in the role. But he is still a hugely underdeveloped character. Lil Ze is a psychotic thug who murders as casually as you or I might pick our nose, he kills about 10 people in a massacre in a hotel at about the age of 10. The deep insights that the film offers us into the creation of such a monster is that he is too ugly to get a girlfriend - is that it?! surely loads of people can't get a girlfriend? There are loads of other characters in the film with much weaker characterisations (e.g. Benny - 'the coolest hood in the COD', who isn't cool at all, just an annoying ponce; Tiago - a loser who hangs around trying to get drugs, he also has a bike; Carrot - a big dealer who doesn't like trouble). One character who did have potential was Knockout Ned, but he ultimately became just another (mostly) mindless perpetrator of violence.My intention is not to completely trash COD, just to point out its (major) flaws. It is a good film and I can understand its popularity, but no way the 18th best film ever! The film is lovely to look at, and guns, drugs, gangs and Brazil are cool - right? But the film has no emotional core. At no point do you feel anxious, sad, happy, affectionate, uplifted, empowered - you may feel shocked near the start but that soon wears off, and then you don't really feel anything."
jgcorrea,"Sep 18, 2013",5/10,"Many consider a movie outstanding just because it shows tragic poverty and violence. Subconsciously, I mean CONSCIOUSLY. People feel ""politically correct"" for liking it. Praise becomes a form of self-elevation.An unpunished, 10 year old killer runs around, kills everyone and then bursts into evil laughs. The horrifying situation exists in reality. But a decent filmic approach ought to be different. This movie has been sold as a kind of triumph of the human spirit, yet it's no more than a typical mobster movie sited at Jacarepaguá, Rio de Janeiro. Scene after scene, someone is killed and the deaths have the same depth or significance of a video game. The protagonist does nothing to improve himself. He is a social victim, period. He features the moral character of a robot. And banditry, to the pervert's delight, recruits untouchable children as hoods. A Guy Ritchie-like gang plot has more than its share of shock: non-stop bloodbaths & revolting human filth. For those fond of Grand Guignol, this is perfectly suitable. Horrible, cheap, including pain and suffering. City of God was just another product from the Third World that dazzled the radical chic community of the First World. Pathetically shot as an elegant, kinda commercial for a hipothetical HLM (Hoods' Lives Mater) movement, edited with rather annoying camera movements. Mixing tragic elements to create a shocking, poignant movie is easy."
Hitchcoc,"Nov 24, 2009",9/10,"One must step back from an absolute sense of repugnance at the violence and look at what the filmmaker has done in this movie. Once you tune yourself into the lives of this cast of characters and their ongoing effort to stay alive and maintain dominance, you can reflect on the amazing cinematography and overall effect of the film. There is an ebb and floe that we watch, almost a dance in the slums of Rio. There is so much poverty that factions have grown up and the people are continually victimized by them as are there individual members. The police are perpetually on the take, so a military state is eventually set up. The main character is a participant early on and then an observer. His photographic skills are his ticket out and his ticket in. There is death and destruction, drugs and murder around every corner. Perhaps the scariest thing are a group of young boys called the Runts who are making a seamless transition into the horrors of the place, keeping things going for yet another generation. I think the most dominant theme of the whole thing has to do with the indifference toward death. Even those who are friends early on will kill their friends because a drug lord says so. It's an unforgettable film."
jotix100,"Feb 7, 2003",8/10,"Quentin Tarantino, eat your heart out! At least in this film they outshot you big time. Watching this film is difficult at times. The violence is to such a degree, the viewer has a problem seating through it.Director Fernando Meirelles has an eye for realism and detail. The most disturbing thing about City of God is the fact that the killers are children playing adult games before they can be children. It is a well known fact that these kids' gangs created terror, not only in the favelas where they lived, which was unfortunate, but they mugged, robbed and just plain terrorized the big cities in Brazil. News about street children being shot in the streets of Rio or Sao Paolo were perceived as criminal because of the ages, but one can get a clearer picture in this film by coming to the realization these same children were killing real grown ups and getting away with murder.The only problem I had with this film is with the English subtitles. Sometimes, one doesn't know who's who. To make matters worse, the principal character grows from a young boy into a photographer who looks like a small boy himself.The plots and subplots are somehow hard to follow at times. The great accomplishment for the director is that he never preaches. He shows the world what went on at that particular time. The realism is extended to the way we see in gory details the corpses of the slain gang members. If Hollywood would have presented scenes that are so hard to take as these, many would be criminals would have been able to see first hand what bullets do to human beings: they kill!"

When the movie got recomended to me, i wasnt sure if i would watch it because it was a foreign movie with a different language. But to my suprise the language doesent even matter, it actually makes it cooler.The cinematography is breathtaking, it really shows the beauty and the not so beauty of Ciadade de deus( city of god) The plot is one of the best i have ever seen and every characters development is so extraordinary. Acting is amazing considering not any superstar actors.The soundtrack is so amazing aswell and it capturest the vibe of brazil.Highly reccomend to movie nerds and movie casuals."
colinjbooth,"May 12, 2020",10/10,"If Martin Scorcese and Quentin Tarantino had a Brazilian baby, this would be that baby. An incredible, powerful, stylish, authentic tour-de-force or filmmaking made all the more incredible by the budget and the perfect child actors. Of the top IMDb movies, this may be the least we'll known, possibly because it is 'foreign' or just because it doesn't have a name actor or big studio behind it, but make no mistake it earns its place in the upper echelons of all-time classics.And to the people giving bad reviews because it is subtitled, learn to read and maybe you'll not miss out on amazing experiences like Citade De Deus.City of God is a stone cold, pure taker of breath."
mumossa64,"May 4, 2010",10/10,"City of god shows a harsh but true view of the slums of Rio and the reason for this being true is because this film is in fact based on a real life story. It is quite shocking as most would see this as unrealistic drama just to be powerful but every disturbing part happened for real. That is what mostly makes this film unforgettable but it has also a stunning story on what could be considered a gangster/ drama film with twists and turns as it goes on and delivers with a lot of depth. This film is subtitled so you must keep up with dialogue fast but that also was well written and despite the actors being relatively unknown, they all performed really well. A true masterpiece"
peruviansilver,"Aug 27, 2006",1/10,"I was really disappointed with this film. It is sold as a sort of triumph of the human spirit film, but it is more like a typical mafia gangster film transplanted to Brazil and the seventies. I was waiting for the Godfather to come out any minute and say ""He takes out a knife, yah take out a gun."" Scene after scene is of someone getting killed and the deaths have all the depth and meaning of a pixel creature getting shot in a video game. This film entertains on the most base level and has no depth whatsoever.I can't say that I cared about anyone in this film, except for maybe Knockout Ned. The main character doesn't really do anything to improve his life. It is more like he just wanders out of the neighborhood. Where is the triumph in that? He also never seems to pass judgement on anyone or anything that happens around him. Its like stuff just happens. This dude died, and then that dude died, and yawn.... Great, he has the moral character of a robot, real inspiring.I also noticed that its one of those ""based on a true story"" films, like that is supposed to make us think. ""Wow, I just saw a part of life that I never understood before. Its hard to believe that life is so cheap and that no one cares about anything in this neighborhood."" Well, I don't buy it. Its just too cartoonish to be real. Maybe the basic story line happened but that is about it.By the way, my wife walked out on this film. I guess she thought going to the meat packing plant and watching cows being slaughtered would probably be entertainment at the same level. But at least it wouldn't be set to Samba music!"
ridgyolive,"Jun 26, 2020",N/A,"I just saw this movie, and it is one of the best foreign language films that I think I have ever seen! I have recently been getting into foreign cinema with a lot of the Korean movies (Parasite, Oldboy), and I know there is no comparing them, since they are completely different, this movie holds up with them! It might even be better! It is fantastic, it utilizes the gritty cinematography and the editing to play to the themes of the story very much. It may be one of the best looking and flowing films that I have ever seen. It is really something unique, and I would recommend anyone to watch this."
halimaxoxo,"Oct 7, 2019",9/10,"The film was something very unexpected and interesting. I did not think that it would be something that I would enjoy or even think to watch. It made me question many things in society and within my own life. We live in a very sheltered society and it might make us more desensitized to the struggles of people across the world. We start to think in terms of ""us vs. them"".This film was very eye opening to the struggles of those involved in gang violence. It was so easy for people to get dragged into the problems. Even young children were not spared from this battle zone. Their naivety is taken advantage of and exploited for the gain of the gang leaders. It was heartbreaking to watch some of the scenes due to the intense violence shown towards such young people. People got involved regardless of their personal beliefs because their loved ones might be involved in it somehow even if they would like to avoid it. This cycle of gang violence and frequent change in leadership led/ leads to many problems.The film itself was very aesthetically pleasing visually and the storyline was built very well. I particularly enjoyed the visuals of the town itself during the 1970's. The color was very soft and the essence seemed more clean. The colors become more dark when the storyline became more current. This may have been to symbolize the darkness that was present within Li'l Ze. When the tender trio were in the city of God, there was more peace and tranquility in comparison to when Li'l Ze ""took over"".This film was one of those things that will most likely stick with me for years to come. It will make me see the world in a new light."
kasperbaggerman,"Jan 6, 2015",9/10,"One of my favorite movies. I can be very short about this film. Never has a movie evoked so many emotions in such a short period of time from me. From raw excitement during some scenes to sadness in others. The story is very well presented, with realistic characters. The good guys aren't 100% good, nor are the bad guys 100% bad. For me, every character had at least one thing I could relate to, even Zedje. Some may consider the film to be too violent, but I think the violence is needed to realistically portrait the hard life in the City of God, or any other slum where drug cartels are present. A well shot and edited film, with uplifting music, an evoking story an ensemble of characters, uplifting music. What more could one wish for in a movie?"
pedrofjmk,"Mar 10, 2005",10/10,"Let's imagine for a split-second that you have not read a line about 'City of God' as you click Play in your remote. As the footage starts, the camera snaps back and forth in a frenzy, people dance the samba, a party is on the make, a poor chicken watches as her mates become chicken wings. And hence we get to the big chicken run. It's the most brilliant scene of the whole movie - in fact, the whole movie revolves around it. Around this frantic scene and the shooting that follows and that sadly shows the reality of thousands of Brazilians in Rio and elsewhere. There is no space in Paulo Lins' novel for the idle hedonism of 'Capitães da Areia', the renown Jorge Amado classic that tells us the story of a junior delinquent gang in the streets of Salvador in Bahia. 'City of God' simply has no space. Not even space for the viewer. From the first scene onwards, you are permanently reminded that you aren't but a viewer, that you are outside, that you have absolutely not the slightest-faintest-slimmest idea of what it feels like to be inside. The narrative structure is a strike of genius in that sense. Not that it was a cutting-edge idea - it has been done time and time again. But the manipulation of at least three hand-held cameras, the constant sound of samba and the relapses of the story, together with the sheer vivacity of the original dialogues (mind you, I do mean the original, extremely nuanced Rio favela-slang Portuguese dialogues!!) make the movie possible to be watched without post-traumatic-stress. You are outside, and you know it. Your whole body is either stiff or numb, uncomfortable in any case. That strange butterfly-cold-revolving sensation in your stomach reminds you that you are not comfortable. The way you breathe (or don't)reminds you that you're not comfortable. The way you bite your knuckles or shake your head in disbelief, perhaps the dampness of your eyes when that young child cries in fear of being shot dead reminds you that you are not comfortable, that this is not your world. Sometimes, in your deep discomfort, your thoughts will go ashtray, only to be rescued back by the next still, the next title, the nest flashback that requires your attention. That is the stylistic exercise that achieves the objective of keeping you focused and in your seat. That is the role Meirelles responsibly takes as film director.The rooftops of 'City of God' in the '60s remind me of Soweto. The street scenes in the '60s remind me of Soweto, Jo'burg today. Or Gaza. Or Bagdad. Or Monrovia. Or Mogadiscio. Or Rio, for the matter. See a pattern here? There is no innocence any more. There is simply the ignorance that another life is possible outside those impossible invisible walls of the favela. There is crime and punishment, cause and consequence, shoot and shoot-back, or better yet, shoot-before. It could be a war anywhere in the world. Yet, it's the city you choose to go to for holiday. You'll be dazzled after you watch these 130 minutes. Meirelles allows you the luxury of enjoying the story, despite the violence contained in it. But do stop to think about it for a minute afterwards. Think: how many of those real-life actors, casted in a real-life favela in Rio do you believe had a similar fate since 2002? Think again. This is the harsh reality. Imagine this was a documentary - you would need counseling after watching. But you do need to know what lies behind Morro-do-Pão-de-Açúcar (Sugar Loaf Mountain). Some wars happen in the gut of our society - in Rio as in Paris or L.A., and 'City of God' is there to remind you.And, well, contrarily to what you thought, the worse in Rio is not that your camera gets knacked. Now you've learned that you'll never see the worse, lucky you... F.y.i., the chicken escapes alive (clever chicken!)."
planktonrules,"Nov 13, 2005",9/10,"When I say ""horrible"" I am referring to the vileness of the characters and terrible images in the film. Technically speaking, this is a great film--with some of the most amazing and innovative cinematography I have ever seen. The stories are interwoven very well and the film seems so very real. It is so unfortunate at the film's conclusion you find out that although these are actors, the story itself is true. It's just so hard to imagine living in this hell on Earth in Rio. After seeing this film, there's no way I am ever visiting Brazil!! I'm sure many viewers feel the same way due to the absolute brutality of their slums where the police do little to interfere with gangs who run it.FYI--there's an excellent and sobering documentary on the Criterion DVD of this movie about the drug problem in Rio in the present day. However, it and the film itself are very intense and bloody so I would not allow kids or even teens to view the film. It's really a shame, as most of the way through the documentary I realized it would be a great thing to show my high school world history class. But, the sight of a room full of naked teens with their penises a-dangling changed my mind!"
Danny_G13,"Apr 24, 2004",6/10,"I knew this was a powerful tale of despair in amongst violence, and that it was a very well received piece.It's the tale of Rocket, a young boy who grows up in the slums in the City of God, and who witnesses at first hand the full extent of conflict.In the City of God, violence is a cancer which spreads and engulfs its host, and no one can escape from it unless they are very, very lucky.Rocket's love of photography may just be his passport out, but with the city under the iron fist of Li'l Ze, a gang leader with a totalitarian control of the city, realising his dreams may not be easy, or indeed possible at all.There are many, many characters in City of God, and each of them get a significant amount of screentime which gives the movie a depth few others can achieve due to the effective grittiness of how their respective stories are told.The main problem I have with this story is that somehow it fails to really suck you in. A movie like this relies on drawing emotion from the viewer, and having a genuine view of each character be it hate, love, empathy, or sympathy.In City of God, too few characters achieve this.I found myself having feelings only about Li'l Ze and Knockout Ned. The likes of Benny, Shaggy, Carrot and the main protagonist Rocket drew very little from me.It took until about an hour and a half in before I felt truly part of the story which, for me, is too long.Putting this flaw aside, City of God is a very well told movie, which uses effective direction. It's just a pity I felt like I was watching events from afar rather than right inside."
ordePNicola,"Aug 13, 2015",9/10,"Probably the best movie that the Portuguese language has ever seen. The way that Fernando Meirelles used to capture and describe the harsh reality of Brazilian slums and, via a special embodiment , was able to transpire the difficulty that young people have to disconnect from the criminal environment surrounding them and all the corruption and urban warfare that exists in Brazil today .Fantastic cast, could not have been better chosen .Maybe if this movie was spoken in English language, it might have been further recognized.Congratulations to all involved and keep up the good work to producers and director."
dashtag1234,"Dec 23, 2020",9/10,"Fernando Mierelles is a genius. I'll tell you why. He directed a bunch of non-actors and made them feel real, like they were real characters. It's not like these guys are playing themselves 100% I'm sure the actor of Lil Ze is not a real psychopath. The way City of God is shot makes it feel real, like a documentary, and it is kind of beautiful. The storytelling is clever, and the use of shots is also very clever. Can't believe how this movie didn't win or get nominated for best foreign. It's violent and brutal, but still a remarkable film."
Padrese,"Feb 28, 2005",9/10,"Wow,really good movie. The action of the movie is placed in the rough hoods in Rio and presents the hard life there or how the narrator says:""City of Gods has nothing to do with the Rio De Janeiro you see in postcards"" It has everything-love,war,revenge,crime,funny.The movie can be seen in two opposite ways- of the child who wants to escape from the rough world and of the rest of the children from there who think the only place to make something in life is there. The actors match very well with the story ,also the director Fernando Mirelles done a very good job. In conclusion this movie deserve his spot in the top of the best movies ever made."
brad861222,"Oct 8, 2018",9/10,"It's always important for good movies to keep some mysteries, so that I enjoyed the time guessing why the issues happened through watching the movies.
Besides, villains got what they deserved after they committed crimes, and victims got the chance to revenge are the most exciting plots for sure."
xavezm,"Jan 6, 2024",10/10,"Over two decades since the release of this stylistic, at every moment enjoyable, gangster epic! Roger Ebert, then reviewed it it call it the ""Best film you'll ever see"".Film at its best, transcending the ganster genre to build characters over an ambitious decade of excess and at times numerous exploits.City of God serves as a unique blend of Scorsese gangster stylized violence to even jump cuts and daring camera angles. Tarantino is brought to mind for the seamless dialogue to violence, which is more desensitized the point we are convinced with the gangs that this is truly the only way of life.Until we meet knock out Ned for the dangerously embarrassing encounter that shifts the narrative of the film. Although so many layers are pulsating all at once. Similarly we are following and being lead along the way at a safer distance with the films photographer. Who's mission is to find his way, lead us though it all so must root for him, a lonely hero.The main violent we come to appreciate is the couple of lead gangsters we grow to know and trust. A bold and handsome more intelligent one, balanced out by one that wouldn't hesitate to show he has much to prove. All the while entertaining an audience without reservations.City of God as layered and as long a scope as is undertakes, triumphs at every turn.I'd agree with other comparisons to the Godfather, with every scene to perfectly loaded with interstellar visuals, deep character interactions. Also bringing to life, to Cinema, a whole unique world of its own to audiences.10/10."
lmnjb,"Oct 8, 2024",9/10,"City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Kátia Lund, stands as a seminal exploration of urban violence, class disparity, and the cyclical nature of poverty in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. Adapted from Paulo Lins' semi-autobiographical novel, the film offers a sobering portrayal of life in the favelas, where violence is not merely a symptom but an inescapable, systemic force shaping the lives of its inhabitants.The film's most compelling strength lies in its complex narrative structure, which mirrors the chaotic environment it depicts. Told through the eyes of Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), an aspiring photographer, City of God masterfully intertwines multiple storylines, illustrating the inescapable interconnectedness of crime, poverty, and survival in the slums. Meirelles' use of nonlinear storytelling not only reinforces the sense of entrapment but also reflects the randomness of fate within the favela-violence erupts without warning, and no character is ever truly safe."
jackalfonsosolano,"Jul 28, 2024",10/10,"This movie is g r o o v y; it's haunting. This movie is a coming-of-age; it's a perfect crime movie. This movie is funny; it's tragic. However, City of God is not suffering an identity crisis. Instead it is the greatest movie of all time, a perfect blend of a million different scenes. Pick out one scene: it's reminiscent of a western. Pick out another: it's a teenage summer movie. Yet another: it's a Scorsese-esque gangster flick. City of God feels like if the best parts of cinema were all thrown into a script and blended together absolutely perfectly. This is perhaps the greatest movie of all time."
conormarshall,"Feb 9, 2023",9/10,"Writing this as an 18 year old, I sometimes find that certain films from before i was born have been hyped up to me so much that, though i usually still enjoy them, they can't quite live up to my expectations. City of God is an exception that enthralled me from the jump.This film is exquisitely crafted. Every shot is a frenetic, disorienting haze that quickly builds a real sense of danger and tension even in quieter scenes. The performances are dynamite as well. Each filled with raw emotion, helping them to feel truly authentic and helps to make the characters feel simultaneously like the anarchic problem destroying the city and yet renders them sympathetic to the audience as they are too the biggest victims of their circumstances.This film is phenomenal. Many movies are said to be based on true stories, but not many ever seem to feel as unrelentingly real as in Cidade de Dues. This is a must watch."
buiger,"May 28, 2017",7/10,"I saw this movie with a couple of friends, and none of us had any prior knowledge of the film. Interestingly enough, none of us where overly impressed... I only realized afterwards, when I went on to IMDb to write my review, that this is considered by many to be one of the best motion pictures ever made! I was shocked. Not to say that it is a bad movie, because it isn't, but it is nowhere near being very good, let alone a masterpiece.What is it missing? Well, in my opinion, a lot. For starters, the script is very weak. We hardly get to know any of the characters well enough, and consequently do not care what happens to them. This is a major flaw, a 'conditio sine qua non', I cannot imagine a good movie that does not transmit emotions. The same is with the cinematography... The camera is too hectic, the cuts too frequent, the movie looks too much like a video spot or a commercial. I know it is modern, but I find it unfit for a full length motion pictures.So why then all the hype? In my opinion, most people living in the developed world nowadays are so far removed from the harsh realities of life, so used to living their comfortable, politically correct, protected, cuddly lifestyles that seeing something like this is so far from their understanding that it 'shocks' them and they believe they are experiencing something metaphysical, highly artistic... Consequently, they praise these movies in the belief that by doing so, it also makes them more 'artistic', because they can 'understand'. How sad."
frjenny92,"Nov 21, 2009",1/10,"Nowadays some consider a movie to be phenomenal as long as it shows tragical poverty and violence. It is so distinct from their lives that they unconsciously feel ""educated"" by seeing the film; praising the film therefore becomes a way of self-elevation.City of God's fancy cinematography did not appeal to me. Unnecessary stylization in this case offends the serious topic, in my opinion. Feels more like a showcase than a honest presentation.If one wants to dig deep into tragic elements in order to make a teary, ""shocking"" film, he can always go as far as his claws can take him. But there's a stopping point by which the whole thing becomes a sham too pretentious to be appreciated. A 10 year-old running around killing everyone and then enjoys himself a couple of evil laughs (that are made to echo to achieve ""epic"" cinematic effects)? ""Cliche"" would be an understatement...I haven no objection to the theme of the movie. By all means such horrifying situations do exist in reality. But I really wish the approach to present the themes was different."
Ashitaka137,"Apr 14, 2021",10/10,"The storytelling, the screenwriting, the directing, etc... practically everything in this movie is perfection! Definitely a must watch."
SydneyGiGi,"Sep 7, 2024",10/10,"From the opening chicken chase, against the backdrop of slum-life in Rio, Fernando Meirelles favela masterpiece delivers a brisk 2 hours of period criminality.Rocket and his voice guide us through the turmoil of living in the most dangerous place on earth and somehow it seems more vibrant than New York and cooler than London or Paris.The characters we meet along the way are equally iconic and terrifying as we are introduced to the cycle of violence that makes kids into killers.The soundtrack and cinematography are wonders to behold, but the performances of its mainly young cast (with the exception of the great Seu George) is what will haunt you all the way home.A masterpiece that must not be missed."
baumhenrik,"Jun 23, 2019",9/10,"As one of the highest rated movies on IMDb, I had a certain expectation when watching it and it's easy to say that the movie kept up with it.The viewer gets thrown into a world full of violence and no rules. You get to know the people - and especially the little boys and young men - who live and also die in that exact world. Story wise no time is wasted. Each scene contributes to the progress of the story which gives the movie a good pace that is enhanced even more by the fast cuts and shaky camera. The actors deliver a great performance, especially considering that the actors are mostly inexperienced. Maybe that's exactly why they manage to portray their characters in such an authentic way.I enjoyed watching this movie very much and would recommend it to everyone who likes a good gangster story with a little more substance to it than your average blockbuster."
aruslanzhabbarovkrut,"Jan 19, 2022",8/10,"The first shots of the film show a sharp blade being carelessly sharpened on a rough whetstone. The purpose of the blade is to cut off the heads of chickens and clean off grayish feathers from their dead fragile carcasses. Chickens are doomed. They see everything that is happening around. They see the heads of their former comrades and neighbors fly off with colorful fountains of spray. They see how shiny knives plunge into helpless lifeless ribs. But they can't do anything, even if they wanted to."
freesancocho,"Jul 15, 2024",8/10,"City of God! I've watched this movie several times. One of my favorite all time movies. Just to let you know it is a very long movie. I believe it is also only in Portuguese. I speak Spanish so I kind of understand some of the stuff but I always watch it with subtitles anyway. It is a very emotional, intense, violent movie. I do believe the cinematography could be better in the sense of just quality. However the story line and the details within the movie are extraordinary. If you are into suspenseful, story telling, crime, triumphant, action movies I recommend it. It is definitely a classic. It is however not family friendly. It does have some very sensitive content."
trcrossland,"Sep 3, 2025",10/10,"Cidade de Deus is a staggering achievement in world cinema-equal parts visceral, poetic, and unflinching. Set in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, the film traces the lives of children who grow up surrounded by violence, poverty, and the intoxicating pull of power. What makes it extraordinary is its refusal to sensationalize; instead, it observes with sharp clarity, exposing systemic cycles of crime and despair without losing sight of the humanity within its characters.Fernando Meirelles's direction is masterful, blending kinetic camerawork with lyrical storytelling. The editing is razor-sharp, giving the narrative both urgency and inevitability, while the shifting timelines create a tapestry of interwoven fates. Visually, the film brims with energy, immersing the audience in the color, chaos, and contradictions of the favela.Yet, beneath its grit lies startling beauty. Rocket's perspective as narrator provides a crucial anchor-his love of photography offering a lens of hope and artistry against the backdrop of violence. This balance between brutality and transcendence is what makes the film unforgettable: it is at once horrifying in its violence and deeply moving in its search for meaning.Verdict: Cidade de Deus is not just a film-it is an experience, a mirror held up to society's failures, and a testament to cinema's power to confront and illuminate. A flawless 10/10."
kateparis-72298,"Jul 23, 2020",10/10,They actually shoot it in favelas with real people that live there. This must have been really hard to shoot. Congrats to all crew. The other thing is beyond the difficulties to shoot there they actually produced a really nice movie. If we don't give to this movie 10 then where are you going to give it?
ickko,"Mar 15, 2007",6/10,"I cannot say it is a bad movie. Actually it is one of the best i have seen lately... I went to the movies when the movie first came to my country, I didn't like it very much. Yesterday I wanted to see it again, because may be i couldn't understand it when i was 16 or 17 when i first saw it. I played the DVD tonight, and yes, i really hadn't catch quite the movie 5 years ago. Now I did, but that doesn't made me love it. Yes, the story was quite original and the director did a good job, but in my opinion this isn't enough for a movie to qualify in the top 20 of the greatest movies here... Leandro Firmino(Li'l Ze) performs great and deserves a high praise, but can it really compare to the performance of, for example, Al Pacino in Heat (160 positions under City of God in Top250). This is ridiculous. It is quite unfair that foreign language movies are rated so high, just because they are not American. I really don't mean to offend anyone. I still think the movie is good, but still cannot compare to much more valuable movies which even didn't make it to the top250. As I already said it is just an average gangster movie. And please don't judge my opinion, cause everyone has the right to like or not like a movie, no matter if it is in the top20..."
Robert-63,"Feb 14, 2004",1/10,"Being based on a true story, having lots of non-actors, making some very imaginative choices in cinematography, and so forth, this film really throws a lot of stuff at you, and it is impressive in its ability to keep a great many plates spinning in the air (although to tell the truth, if the narrator had said ""but it's not time to tell So-and-so's story yet"" just one more time, I would have screamed).Unfortunately, the next day when you look back on the experience, you realize that all you really got was a couple of hours worth of just another gangland storyline with a little too much Guy-Ritchie-influenced camera work and more than a few this-will-get-them-talking shock cinema moments.Original grade: 6 out of 10. Worth seeing, probably not worth recommending.Revised grade (3/7/2012): 1 out of 10. Abysmal. Horribly bad in a way that makes me think less of people who think it's good."
ahalbatli,"Oct 7, 2019",9/10,"City of God is a masterpiece that the international cinema ever made. I consider it to be the best international movie I have seen so far. This film is a story about the violent life of the favelas in Brazil. City of God may contain the most violent content I have ever seen in a movie, to reflect the original true story. The experience the movie offering is really hard to watch. However, it holds you and you would get more attached more to the story. In the middle of the chaos and violence in City of God the film is about how a young peaceful kid wants to achieve his dream and make something out of his hard life. Also, how young kids can transform to be criminals because of poverty in the town.
The cinematography, music, and the timeline are astonishing, especially, the vibrant colors, which gave the film some life aspects besides the violent and the killing in the movie. The characters are all well developed, but the only thing holding me from giving it 10/10 is the lack of emotion and sadness from the characters in the movie. It could be because of how the Brazilian cinema works but it was the main different than American movies."
PixelmateLive,"Oct 9, 2022",10/10,"""City of God"" is an adrenaline jolt of a film that for once manages to find a balance between stylistics and substance.The director, Fernando Meirelles, stuffs his movie to the brim with machine-gun editing, swirling cinematography and pounding music.While this reliance on fancy tricks has ruined other films, Meirelles is so expert at blending them seamlessly into an engrossing story that the viewer quickly accepts them as inseparable from the world of the film.He delivers a deeply emotional and human story that obviously owes much to Scorsese and Tarantino --- but his movie feels completely original, never like a rip off.And underneath all of the action and plotting, there is a compelling message about about the power of art (specifically the camera) and a suggestion that, just as the pen is mightier than the sword, the camera is mightier than the gun.Can't recommend it enough!"
dorbalinoalves,"Mar 4, 2024",10/10,"""Cidade de Deus"" it's an absolute masterpiece, there's simply no other way to describe it. This is the kind of film I'll rewatch year after year.Fernando Meirelles's direction truly captures the harsh reality of the Favelas in Brasil, where the gun reigns supreme and safety is a luxury no one can really afford. Without holding back, we get to see a dirty, bloody and authentic portrayal ""da Cidade de Deus""This film has it all, action, suspense, thriller, drama, and romance. Its vast storytelling and interconnected narratives remind me of a Guy Ritchie film, complete with a multitude of characters and clever plotlines. Besides that, what truly distinguishes this film is its protagonist, who, much like the audience, serves as a simple observer within the unfolding chaos. Boscapé, the protagonist, embodies a relatable figure that deeply connects with every member of the audience.To conclude I like to point out the amazing work of every single actor present in ""Cidade de Deus"", for their outstanding performance, especially the kid that gets shot in the foot. Get that little man an Oscar.*insert fingertips kiss GIF*
Can't wait to watch it next year."
adamonIMDb,"Nov 17, 2017",9/10,"'City of God' or 'Cidade de Deus' is one of the most realistic and brutal gangster films I have ever seen and without question one of the best foreign language films ever made. Set in the slums of Rio, it gives an shocking account of gang culture in a city where crime and violence is the natural path for most young people growing up in deprived communities.The way in which the story is told, from Rocket's perspective, contributes enormously to the film. The narration, combined with the realistic storyline and characters, means 'City of God' plays more like a documentary than a crime/drama film adapted from a novel. There's no shortage of violence and some of the scenes are very hard-hitting, but 'City of God' is well worth the ride. A bold, brutal and simply brilliant film."
zacharyklozik,"Oct 7, 2019",9/10,"City of God or Cidade de Deus is a high-intensity roller-coaster ride that does not allow you to exit. The movie is based on the real events that happened in the City of God in Brazil, and it shows the brutality of a city that is strangled by gang wars and drug addictions.The movie can be considered ultra-violent, but it manages to not lose itself in the bloodshed with moments that show tranquility. This leaves you with feelings of dread and joy that create a turmoil within as you are mystified by a story that holds no punches.City of God feels even more real when you realize that some of the unknown actors in the film are also people who used to live the City of God, and the movie is split into different ""stories"" that are meant to represent the lives of some of the big time players in the city. These tales can either be instances of complete horror or moments that are honest and wholesome.The movie's cinematography and editing are also worthy of commendation. The way that what is captured in the frame comments and exemplifies the story is an instance of genius.City of God acts not only as a record of a city that is embroiled in vicious violence, but it also acts as an example of the extent at which filmmaking can be pushed, being one of the most visually striking movies that I have seen. It is a movie that lets you gnaw on terror but only enough so that you do not burn your taste buds."
Spinal-Column,"Jan 30, 2003",7/10,"If I had written this review as soon as I came out of the cinema I think I would have given it 9/10. However, having had a week or so to reflect on the movie I don't think I will be quite so generous.CITY OF GOD has many good points: the directing, the acting, the locations, the interesting storyline. But I can't help thinking that it's all a little hollow. The central theme of the movie is that violence breeds violence -true but trite. Perhaps the worst thing about it is that, despite the violence, the slums in which the film is set don't seem like such a terrible place to live. The people there have a strong sense of community and, as long as they don't step out of line, all seem to be fairly happy. As a piece of social commentary, I don't think the movie really pulls it off.Regardless of these flaws, CITY OF GOD is stunning to look at and a joy to watch. If you like action or gangster movies then this is the film to see.7/10"
ryanb90,"Mar 27, 2021",10/10,"I'm in awe every time I watch this film. Every scene, every piece of music, every actor is in complete unison with one another. A perfectly structured, incredibly told gem of a film. Masterpiece."
sweetrindthefilm,"Oct 21, 2022",10/10,"This film is a true masterpiece - one that should be placed in the category with classics like Pulp Fiction and The Shawshank Redemption. It has managed to achieve a depth that many films with much bigger budgets had not, no doubt lending to its huge box office success.It is gritty, raw, honest and the story transcends its Brazilian borders and feels very familiar to a Caribbean audience. It is one that captures your mind and pervades your thoughts for its entirety and does not soon leave you.Very few movies, so well made, are worth revisiting. This one remains a part of a collective conscience that should be explored - pulled apart and pieced back together with each replay - discovering purpose and motivation from a different perspective each time."
gbread7,"Mar 30, 2003",N/A,"City of God was a study in brutality.  Offending all of the senses, the movie proceded in using a multisensory approach to capture the very essence of violence, in every sense of the word.  Human beings of every age were tortured and murdered.  A main character was depicted inflicting multiple injuries and deaths while laughing hysterically.  I had to wonder what the point of the movie was.  Any claim to artistic expression evaded me, entirely."
Travis_Bickle01,"Oct 30, 2005",8/10,"""Cidade de Deus"" is the breakthrough of Brazilian director Fernando Meirelles (""The Constant Gardener""). It tells the unbelievable but true story of the gang life in a poor neighbourhood of Rio de Janeiro. The neighbourhood is mostly ruled by kids and young adults, who doesn't play cowboy and Indian like most kids of their age do. No, most of the time they are busy dealing drugs, robbing local stores or killing other young adults in order to extend their territory.The story is told by Rocket, a young guy who tries to live an honest life and not to be involved in the gang life. Fernando Meirelles made an amazing movie of an exceptional story. The story is disturbing and chocking. If it wasn't based on true events, this movie wouldn't have been such a big hit either. It's the combination of an objective style, fast filming, a great soundtrack and the chocking story that made ""Cidade de Deus"" a revolutionary movie.Although the events are tragic, don't expect a melodramatic story. I don't think the purpose of the director was to move us. I think he wants as to be chocked after seeing this movie. Although we are confronted with violence on TV every day when we watch the news, the fact that kids are involved in this kind of gang life is really chocking.Although I really liked this movie, I think it's highly overrated. Personnaly, I don't think it deserves such a high ranking in the Top 250. Nevertheless an excellent movie. 8/10"

Flagrant-Baronessa,"Jun 22, 2006",10/10,"City of God is set in poverty-stricken and corrupt Rio de Janeiro and bravely zooms in on its young citizens in their extremely violent day-to-day circumstances. Some of them are really only just kids. I don't mean kids like ""rowdy teens"", but actual little children with guns and blood on their hands. It is quite heartbreaking to watch, but very compelling at the same time.As it follows the life of two childhood friends who take very different paths in life, it is an excellent portrayal of erasthe 60s, 70s and 80scapturing the style, music and way of life of each. Between the two story lines, the director introduces a multitude of violent characters and their lives in Rio through titled segments. Unlike Tarantino's violent segments, they are cohesive.It is also stunning to see how well the actors performed in their individual parts, especially when I come back here on IMDb and read that they were not even professional actors, but locals recruited specifically for the film. Wow! More praise: I think City of God possibly has the best cinematography I have ever seen in a movie. It had such a unique mix of shotssometimes choppy editing (but not Tony Scott seizure-inducing), 70s TV style images, quick camera movements and other times more drawn out and more ""epic"" shots. All the while it truly felt as though you were there, but desperately wanted to get away from the madness.However, it may feel, at times, somewhat like an orgy of drugs and guns or mindless glorification of street violence to appeal to teen audiences.But then I realised the violence is not gratuitous because City of God is about violence (duh, I know) and it condemns it in many ways, such as making out the protagonist non-violent and aspiring to a better life, and getting us to sympathise with him more than anyone else."
Chris_Docker,"Jan 30, 2003",8/10,"The most moving moment in a trip I made to Brasil occurred when I visited a community school in the slums (favelas). These children were desperately trying to better themselves  the school (paid for from community and rotararian funds with no government help) was their *only* chance to get out of the cycle of hopelessness and crime. The awful dilemma was that the community and its inhabitants were protected and supported (with no strings attached) by the local drugs and gun running infrastructure. I was safer there than on the streets of Copacabana  no-one would harm a tourist as that might attract police attention (bad for business). One infraction to law and order would mean a warning  the second, death.City of God looks at the slum area (a slightly less criminalised one than the one I visited) some years not to long ago as it evolved towards this position. The honest struggles of a teenager to break the mould, and the enormous pressures on his less intelligent peers to enter the short lived occupation of  gangster. There are many moral challenges the audience is forced to confront, including the many shades of villains that accept a certain degree of criminality in order, at least in part, to do some good in an environment where the worst are very bad indeed and even the police are generally known to be more corrupt than some of the drug-runners.This is a monumental film ,bravely told and skilfully put together. It opens a world that is largely unseen by the developed West, telling a nail-biting story that accurately reflects generations of children and adults lost to a world we wouldn't wish on anyone. Queasiness at an opening scene where live chickens are beheaded for the cooking pot is soon put into insignificance as we realise the horrific cheapness of human life. This rollercoaster ride of a movie leaves you with very uncomfortable questions about the nature of goodness. Even thinking back to it now brings tears to the corners of my eyes."
eddsj,"Mar 21, 2005",9/10,"City of God is based on the true events of a young man growing up watching everything around him is destroyed. Families are changed and friendships are destroyed so that each character can escape the ghetto that consumes his life.City of God captures innocence lost at an early age and spans two decades in Rio de Janerio. The movie tackles the hardships of living in poverty, a situation in which the only way out for many is to fight and steal. City of God has two main characters: Rocket and Lil Ze; the movie uses these characters to show that there are different ways to escape the ghetto. Rocket uses his brain and an eye for a great photograph. Lil Ze takes a completely different approach to escape, using muscle and weaponry to take over the drug trade in Rio.Bráulio Mantovani does an amazing job of making each character three-dimensional. Each character is built with personality and attitude. There is black and white, good and evil. The movie shows the events that each character has gone through to come to a decision point that could change his life from that day on.City of God borrows a lot of the ideas and techniques from American films. The gangster motif is something that has been done in the United States for over eighty years. Drawing from modern American hits like Goodfellas and Casino, City of God takes over-the-top characters and puts them in adverse situations. A common theme in these movies is the obsession with money and what to do with it when you have it. A big difference between City of God and its American counterparts is how real the violence seems. There is nothing to glorify the killings that take place in City of God.Another American movie that City of God pulls from is Citizen Kane. Just as in Citizen Kane, flashbacks are used to reveal the story and develop characters. In Citizen Kane, the technique is used to show what kind of man Mr. Kane was. In City of God it is used by the screenwriter and director to develop characters in a limited amount of time.City of God has it all: a great story line that fosters the development of all the characters, the struggle to overcome one's past, and the battle between good and evil."

parsleylion,"Mar 4, 2004",6/10,"City of God is about a district in Rio or some Brazilian city where poverty is rife and known as the city of god. Told through the eyes of one of the inhabitants who witnesses the growth of crime amongst the young men and boys of the area, the story is supposed to be true and unhappily it looks an honest enough assessment of any rundown poverty stricken urban neighbourhood no body cares about. the cycle of crime sounds familiar, using kids as couriers for drugs, random killings, turf wars, addiction, hopelessness, squalor and filth. told at a fast pace in a episodic story character by character, the place soundslike one step up from a concentration camp [see the work of Primo Levi about what thats like] Oddly the storyteller goes on to leave the ghetto by becoming a photojournalist, a similar story was told here on Irish TV by a young man who was in trouble from age 8 till his early 20's when he learnt to write and became a journalist so he could break the cycle of damaging behaviour he had. the truth is to get an education seriously as characters in the film are constantly telling the storyteller but he gets out by luck mainly and having a strong character. not a brilliant film, a relentlessly told story, violent and depressing, though honest 10 out of 10 for that; it should be labelled a docudrama rather than a film  but then less people would see it, but I wonder if I or anyone really know what it means?

Elori,"Sep 29, 2007",3/10,"There are certain people who have developed a very negative view towards Hollywood movies and U.S. cinema. In this mindset, any movie coming from the US is automatically lambasted, while non-US cinema is praised without merit. City of God, or Cidade de Deus, is one such case. Its serious overvaluing can only be attributed to a cloudy-eyed sentimentalism for the real situation behind the movie without even considering whether the movie itself has value in portraying that situation. And the unfortunate case is, no. Meirelles and Luns' generic directing is completely devoid of feeling and insight, and the actors are merely going through the motions, lacking any emotional impact in the actual proceeding of the screenplay. For these failings, the film collapses into a jiltingly generic mashup of violence and crime, with nothing to tell. There is no shock value, there is no empathy, there are no thoughts evoked. Perhaps this movie has some appeal and bearing to people who are more closely connected to Brazil and the kind of events portrayed, seeing as they can draw from another experience to put some weight into the matter, for this film by itself has none. It takes a special kind of pretentiousness and self-delusion to rate this film highly on its own merits, and the kind of a critic that dares not criticize a film with a sensitive subject. Yet this film desperately needs more of a voice of reason to call it for the empty shell it is."
elsinefilo,"Jan 2, 2006",N/A,"""City of God"" is about making your own way really! No matter in which conditions you're living in the life you lead is not always conglomeration of what you've lived always but it's something you pick and choose in a life you lead. The more you have power to direct yourself, to choose for yourself, the more decisive and decided you are the more successful you will be. Of course the society always shapes people and it's not the linchpin for your destiny. The movie is such a story. While Rocket dreams of being a photographer and makes his way into that dream Lil Ze is a hoodlum who satisfies his thirst for murder, who plunders and who desire more and more power. City of God is totally realistic! I am impressed by the fact that most of the actors in the film had never acted before and were, in fact, residents of favelas(slums)such as Vidigal and the ""City of God"" itself. The setting and the time fiction seems totally realistic too.If you wanna a realist piece of story do not forgo watching until the end!"
ecooley1,"Mar 12, 2009",10/10,"This movie is amazing! The plot is strong and very thick without ever becoming pretentious or slow. The action scenes are very gritty and real and not full of Hollywood overindulgence and the violence is framed more for poignancy than shock value. It is obviously very influenced by scorscese but has a modern twist. It seems like a blend of Scorscese's camera work and storytelling with the backdrop of urban ghetto dramas like New Jack City or Boyz N the Hood. Even though the movie is subtitled you never feel like you have to watch the bottom of the screen to stay in the movie. You could almost watch the movie on mute and still soak up ninety percent of the film.I hope that everyone that thinks of themselves as a movie buff sees this movie. As far as I'm concerned it rivals anything in IMDb's top ten.As a sidenote: I heard about this film when I worked with some Brazilians for a short time. Seu Jorge (knockout ned) is a huge star in South America. He is an actor and musician, and Brazilians worship the guy like a god. I ripped some of his songs from one of the guy's Ipods and have been a huge fan ever since. Seu also has a role in The Life Aquatic, he is the black guy who plays all the music throughout the movie. All the songs are David Bowie songs sang in Portuguese. If anyone wants to try out his music, download ""Mangueira"", it's my personal favorite."
shi612,"Aug 10, 2006",10/10,"This is a literally terrific movie. I was drawn as soon as the opening scene started. The barbecue party on the roof in a crowded houses. The scene they edge a knife and open the chickens with sense of exhilaration gives you feeling of a mixed atmosphere of festivity and cruelty of the whole movie. Then a chicken runs away, and the scene the lead character is flanked by a group of gang and the police immediately turns to another scene of 20 years ago. A breathtaking opening.This movie is based on the story written by a man who is the model of the movie. Though the original story is 550 pages long, the resulting movie looks flawless, with masterful screenplay and camera work. I read that most of casts are not professional actors but chosen from the modeled slum, but it is hard to believe. Take Li'le Ze for example, both in his boy age and youth age, their act of countenance is so impressive. The acting of the boy who is hit his shoe is so vivid that you can hardly watch straight. Anyhow, from the viewpoint of movie making, this is a masterpiece.This is based on real story, and they say such situation still exists in Rio de Janeiro. Then, what is the society that makes human being inhuman to this extent? Poverty could be one of the background. But, in the countries like the Philippines for example this neat town is not even called a slum. It can be said that guns can change human mind. What happens if a brat has a tool to kill a man with a finger? Then how come such tools are handed to the brats that easily? Well, I can not answer just after seeing a movie, but I can say this movie is not a simple accusation in Brazilian society but food for thought for all people in all countries."

Jexxon,"Jan 20, 2005",4/10,"To sum it up in one word: overrated.Let's face it, the story isn't anything new (I know most things have been done before, but still). There's no shortage of films depicting the lives of gangsters from their slow steady rise, to that inescapable fall. What's new here is the fact that we're dealing with kids. It certainly is a different take on a familiar plot, but otherwise there are no surprises. For most of the film, it's various gang members shooting each other when they're not busy doing robberies and drugs.One of the arguments for this film being a classic is that the actors are amateurs and that they are ""real"". OK, if that's what they want to show - do a documentary about them instead of trying to gloss it up with fancy visuals and editing. The latter has also been praised to great extent. My question is: why? There's nothing here that isn't in every other film these days, and certainly nothing that warrants that extra high rating. It only detracts from the story, making the characters all the less believable.It seems like the subject matter (i.e. the horrible conditions under which these kids live - and the fact that it's foreign) has influenced viewers into thinking that the film is somehow better than it actually is. It's really nothing more than a typical genre movie. What's best about the film, and not often mentioned, are some very entertaining humorous scenes that you'd not expect to find in a film like this.

tfrizzell,"Sep 17, 2004",N/A,"A popular surge swept the land just prior to the 2003 Oscars and ""City of God"" became a critical success with the Academy. The popularity is somewhat misleading though as this production has tons of problems with its Oscar-nominated script and uneven performances across the board. The setting early is 1960s Rio de Janeiro. A ghetto just outside the city limits is the breeding ground for dangerous gangs of thugs who are little more than adolescents who go around and create chaotic violence. One of these youngsters grows to become Leandro Firmino, a heartless miscreant who toes the line between just being cruel and being down-right psychotic. He is kept somewhat under control by his top assistant Phellipe Haagensen, but in their world both are in as much danger as those that come into contact with them. As all this goes on another youngster (who grows to become Alexandre Rodrigues) from the same neighborhood looks to take a different route completely by trying to become a photographer. Rodrigues, like his contemporaries, also has a life that seems to be on a tight time table. The picture advances to the 1980s and the ultimate fates of the primary characters come shining through in vivid and ironic fashions. Directors Fernando Meirelles (Oscar-nominated in the category) and Katia Lund develop a technologically interesting picture that benefits greatly from landmark cinematography by Oscar-nominee Cesar Charlone and highly difficult editing techniques by Daniel Rezende (also Oscar-nominated). The camera-work is enough to give this film a high mark, but once again the performers are not as good as advertised and the script by Oscar-nominee Braulio Mantovani is unsteady and a bit pretentious. The fact that the tale is based on fact does not really give the picture any more credibility than it would have if it had been from the mind of a foreign screenwriter. The characters are not always believable and are usually not worth caring about. Many problems, but still a noble and overall intriguing product. 4 stars out of 5."
gelman@attglobal.net,"Dec 22, 2005",9/10,"There are exactly two characters in this movie -- Rocket and Knockout Ned -- who are in any way sympathetic. Everyone else is a villain or victim, usually both. The film does not contain a single frame that relieves the brutality, violence, poverty and degradation which are its themes. See it but understand what you'll be seeing: drug trafficking and casual murder (mostly done for ""business"" reasons but also for the sheer pleasure of killing) by young people and even by children in a terrible, terror-ridden Rio de Janeiro slum. In its way it is harder to watch even than Hotel Rwanda because of its apparent ""artlessness."" You have more of a feeling in City of God that you are actually there, witnessing unbelievably awful events without the small distance that Hotel Rwanda afforded because it was scripted and acted and ""directed,"" because it was art. This movie, on the other hand, feels like you are watching it happen in front of your eyes without a scriptwriter's story telling or a director's mediation. Those illusions are helped along by the fact that there's not a single actor that I recognized from any other movie. The actors ARE the drug dealers, the killers and the victims -- not, as in ""Traffic,"" well-known actors ""playing"" at being drug dealers, killers and victims. ""Traffic"" was very well done. This movie is harrowing."

JackHodges-13503,"Jan 16, 2025",10/10,"City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund, is a visceral and unflinching portrait of life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. Based on Paulo Lins' semi-autobiographical novel, the film chronicles the intersecting lives of young people growing up amidst violence, poverty, and crime. It's a raw and powerful exploration of survival and morality, told with remarkable cinematic flair.The film's narrative structure is both innovative and gripping, weaving together multiple storylines with precision. The non-linear storytelling keeps the audience on edge, revealing the harsh realities of favela life through the eyes of Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), an aspiring photographer who dreams of escaping the chaos around him.Cinematographer César Charlone's work is exceptional, capturing the vibrant yet oppressive atmosphere of the slums with a dynamic, kinetic style. The handheld camera work immerses the viewer in the frenetic energy of the streets, while the vibrant colors and lighting contrast with the grim subject matter.The performances, many by non-professional actors, are authentic and deeply affecting. Leandro Firmino's portrayal of the ruthless Lil Zé is chilling, while the ensemble cast brings an unparalleled realism to their roles.With its pulsating soundtrack, unflinching storytelling, and poignant social commentary, City of God transcends the crime genre. It's a haunting and unforgettable film that sheds light on systemic inequality and the human spirit's resilience. A must-watch for those seeking cinema that challenges and moves them."
Popsicle_A,"Jun 17, 2003",10/10,"The film City of God depicts a world where many children do not live to reach adulthood.  In a city run by drugs, gangs and of lost innocence we see a variety of characters and their stories narrated by a young boy who wants to be a photographer.The direction is excellent and the creative hand-held camera angles are not only perfect for creating the effect of actually being in the scene, but display the directors fabulous artistic eye.  Each chapter has a title and the stories are expertly intertwined, to reveal a incredibly powerful ending.I recommend this film to everyone, BE AWARE that it is brutally realistic(Scenes of gun violence involving children).

udeaasykle,"Mar 7, 2004",10/10,"This was a delight to be watching. When i say delight i don't mean i like seeing people get killed over nothing but it was so masterfully done. I have heard only good things about this movie so i was prepared for a excellent movie, and let me tell you i was not disappointed at all. The movie shows how little a human life is worth in some people eyes. The scariest part is to see the young kids, probably not more than 7-10 years old, carrying guns, thinking it is cool to kill others. The thing i remember best is when one of the young kids says: I smoke and snort. I have robbed and killed. I am a man! What kind of life do you live when you can say that sentence and believe it? Anyways, this is a very good movie and i give it the best rating i can. 10"

bob the moo,"Dec 25, 2003",N/A,"In the slums of Rio de Janeiro is an area called the city of God.  In this area children often do not make it to adulthood.  Rocket is a young man looking to use photography to get himself out of the slums and away from crime.  We follow his story from a child through the 60's and 70's in the slums where he is witness as children Lil' Dice and Bene grow up to become the heads of the gangs, using violence and murder to increase their power.I had missed this in the ONE art cinema in the city I live in and had to wait for the DVD to come out.  It was very much worth the wait.  I wanted to resist the urge to call this film `the Brazilian Goodfellas' simply because everyone else has said it - but it is a fitting description.  Like that film, this is a sprawling story of crime and violence across several decades.  And like Goodfellas it is violent, stylish and a great story that is engaging.  The overall plot focuses on the rise of Lil' Ze and the violence around him, as seen through the eyes of Rocket.Opening with a stylishly shot standoff, the film jumps back over twenty years and begins to introduce a range of characters who come and go throughout the film to give a back story of violence and crime.  The film jumps around quite a bit but it serves to build up a picture of the area and the characters involved.  The violence is not gory but it is sudden and shocking - children killing children, bloody sudden deaths and so on; but it is not sensationalised but rather very depressing and down to earth.The direction is very slick and the overall production and feel of the film is one of style and imagination.  The opening of a 360 pan around Rocket is an indication of the style than runs through the whole film.  It even manages to have a mix of styles - fast cutting edits work best in moderation, which is exactly what this film does.  The soundtrack is great and the film definitely owes a debt to Scorsese.The cast are very talented and very natural considering that few of them have any experience acting.  Alexandre Rodrigues is great as Rocket even if he gets overshadowed by Leandro Limrino attention grabbing Ze (in the same way as we all remember Joe Pesci over Ray Liotta).  The rest of the cast is almost perfect to a boy.  Even the young children are convincing and powerful and there are no bum notes in the performances - it is very impressive but the sad thing is that I suspect that for many of them, this was not a stretch as this is really their life.Overall this is a tremendous film - easily the best of the year.  It is slick and stylish but not at the expense of the story, which is a dizzy collection of characters and action.  If you like Goodfellas then you will simply love this film.  Hell, if you like cinema - you will like this film."
helenekim,"Dec 2, 2009",9/10,"I knew nothing about this film before I actually saw it. Considering it was one of the first foreign films I had ever seen I was shocked that I enjoyed it that much. The acting is brilliant, the story is delightful and very understandable. Everything has been put together and made a compelling finish. The camera work helps the film to be so gratifying especially for someone who does not understand the language the film is made in. Every angle tells a different story so you never draw your eyes away for a split second as the film captivates you that much you do not want to a miss a single shot. The director has admirably captured the idea of the poverty, crime, drugs and violence and throughout that you follow Rocket (the one ounce of hope of escapism from the favelas). Considering I had never really enjoyed a foreign film before I would say this was a great one to see and I found it very satisfying and would definitely watch it again."
flickershows,"Mar 1, 2004",8/10,"'City Of God' is not an easy film to watch, nor is it an easy film to like. Were it not for the stark reality that permeates most of the production, this could have been a modern zombie flick. None of the characters in this movie are really alive anyway. They're the walking dead, living each moment with the threat of death knocking holes in their front door. The actors do the best they can with powerful material that offers them no real hope. As I said, zombie flick.After 2002's searing documentary, 'Bowling For Columbine', it seems a little ghoulish to see a movie filled to the brim with shots of kids with guns. And they use their guns oh so casually, killing at will. It's not easy to make a viewer immune to the sight of a child brandishing a gun, let alone firing it, let alone shooting it at people. Repeatedly. After a while, I wasn't appalled anymore. 'City Of God' is relentless in its offhand violence, proving once again that ghetto conditions breed desperation and murder. Perhaps that's truthful. In fact, I have no doubt that this movie is bang-on.That's the rub. For every moment of authenticity, there's one of over-the-top brutality. Is it over the top, however, if it's trying to be factual? I'm not sure. See, I can't say I liked this film, but the energy and raw power brought forth is admirable. Certain audiences should see it (not children, not the weak-stomached), but they need to be forewarned of how rough things get. Director Fernando Meirelles puts the camera literally into the action (think 'Saving Private Ryan' in Brazil) and doesn't allow you to view the horrors from a safe distance.So why am I reserved about this film? Violence in movies doesn't usually bother me. Maybe it's that I found it difficult to relate to the characters. I have never experienced the squalor or pain they experience on a daily basis. And---I have to be honest---I had a hard time keeping everybody straight. Once the film gets going and it settles into the '70s time frame after jumping around a lot, that problem goes away. Still, I was supposed to be engaged from minute one and it took a little longer for me to get warmed up.The young, unknown cast is solid. They're not good enough to be etched in my memory, although Alice Braga (as Angelica) is one of the most beautiful girls I've seen in years. Since the actors are portraying biographical characters, they're already limited in what they can do. Meirelles rings genuine emotions from the legions of kids in this picture, who probably had a blast pretending to be a kill-crazy street gang.I think I'd get into the story and the characters more with a second viewing. But is it worth seeing again? Perhaps. I'd probably never enjoy it, though. There's something cynical going on here, a gloomier resolution than what's in similar subject matter (such as 'Boyz N The Hood'). That film is a tragedy, this one is a tragedy of such extreme proportions that you know nothing can save the people---especially the innocent---in the city of God. Judging by how popular the movie is with audiences worldwide, I'm in the minority here. All I can hope for is that this film illuminates this gangland mentality that we see in all downtrodden cities. If the film helps to correct that issue, it will indeed have served a valuable purpose. I recommend 'City Of God', just not very strongly."
Hawkeleven,"Oct 12, 2019",9/10,"Raw, sincere, carefree, without false pretense, order in the midst of chaos, a movie we should all see at least once in a lifetime."
justineszaflarski,"Oct 7, 2019",9/10,"One sentence to describe this movie best, in my opinion, is difficult to watch, but extremely hard to look away from. City of God is full of chaos, violence, and killing but has a good underlying story of a kid who pushed through his childhood and became a photographer. Anyone who watches this should recognize their privilege. This movie not only makes you think, but make you change your perspective on the world and your part in it. The writer and director take this disturbing content and change it into something intriguing. The performance, the direction, the cinematography, the music, all laced together to create a wonderful film documenting the painful truth of living in a Brazilian slum. Everyone should give this film a chance, you won't regret it."
chriscruzny,"Jan 2, 2005",10/10,"A story like this cannot be written. Only true circumstances in life can generate a tale as the one depicted in City Of God. The simple fact that this was a true story makes this movie even more dumbfounding and astonishing at the same time. This movie is a visual masterpiece in it's crispness and story telling. The format in which the story is told is unique through the eyes of Rocket. The actors pull you into a world that most don't know exist and even through their vile nature and ways of thinking, there is something to love about everyone involved. Watch as Bene becomes a playboy, as Knock-Out Ned becomes a legend and Rocket becomes a man. I have watched this movie numerous times and find myself watching scenes over and over again. Few movies compel one to do so. Sit back and enjoy it."
becascaeiro44,"Jan 17, 2013",9/10,"As a Portuguese boy, i just like to say that this film been so well quoted on IMDb makes me so proud. in my opinion, this is a very good movie and deserves this quotation. there's no more movie in the entire world that describes so well with such brilliance the life at the slum. The drugs, the organized crime, the corrupt cops and poverty and misery is so well represented by the Brazilian actors. The character "" Zé Pequeno"" represents the crime the everyday life of drugs and crime in the slums that causes such insecurity in great cities in Brazil India and Mexico. I totally recommend this one to young boys and girls but also to adult audience."
Agent10,"Aug 14, 2006",9/10,"One thing is for certain, City of God didn't back down on the shock value. From the random killing of children to the more organized gang violence, City of God is more of a testament to the failures of capitalism rather than a failure of law and order. Either way, the film was a stunning depiction of a world no one really gets to see. This is a world you don't see in the tourist guides or in the movies.What was especially incredible about this film was the dirtiness and authenticity. Instead of making this film on some back lot or recreated set, this film was actually made in the slums of Rio. In fact, the slums themselves become a major character in the film, illustrating how disgusting this world truly was. Adding even more authenticity was the use of non-professional actors. While many critics have panned films that have used this paradigm for acting, the lack of false reality made for a rather well acted film.Years from now, this will be considered one of he best foreign films to hail from anywhere, and it is time to take some notice."

kevin_robbins,"Aug 23, 2021",10/10,"City of God (2002) is a movie I originally saw at an advance screening in DC and is now in my DVD collection. It is also available on HBOMax. The storyline has a coming of age feel to it and takes place in the slums of Rio. It tells the tale of a young man trying to accomplish his goals as well as the lifestyle of other kids that grew up in his surroundings the same time as he did. This movie is directed by Fernando Meirelles (The Constant Gardner) and stars Alexandre Rodrigues (Paradise City), Leandro Firmino (Trash), Seu Jorge (Life Aquatic) and Alice Braga (I am Legend). Almost every single aspect of this movie is perfect. I loved the settings and backdrops and how they were filmed. It really did a good job of depicting the character's desperate circumstances. The portrayal of the characters and their evolution as they aged was also very well done. The narration throughout the movie helped with several transitions and established an understanding of the main character's mindset. The violence in this is very sudden and heart wrenching. They do such a good job of establishing the characters and making you feel something for what makes them tick which makes the various circumstances even more interesting. Their backstories are so well developed. The soundtrack is also very good. Overall this is a masterpiece that is definitely worth your time and an easy 10/10."
ceciliajuarez-55831,"Oct 7, 2019",10/10,"The City of God (2002) executes every aspect of an Oscar-worthy film. Cinematographer Cesar Charlone does an exceptional job of conveying real-life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro during the 1960s through the use of color, lighting, music, sound, camera angles, and moving camera shots. Most of the film's shots consists of handheld shots which create a documentary-like film and feels very life-like. In other words, it's almost as if you yourself are living in the City of God.The film is set in the 1960s in the slums of Rio de Janeiro and revolves around a boy named Rocket who refuses to follow the destiny that his life has set for him - working for a drug dealer. The second main character in the film, Lil Ze, is a relentless sociopath - the complete opposite from Rocket. While Rocket has had his mind set on becoming a professional photographer ever since he was a little boy, Lil Ze's goal has always been to be the respected kingpin. Rocket's dream is what keeps him away from Lil Ze but at the same time, it's also what brings him closer to Lil Ze.One of the many scenes that I found cinematically appealing was when Rocket was narrating ""the story of the apartment."" I thought that the use of color and the editing effects helped enhance the story. For example, at the beginning of the scene, the color was warm, signifying that the story of the apartment had started off with innocent intentions since Doa Zelia, the woman who started selling drugs in the apartment, was simply trying to provide for her family. The degradation effect is used effectively to show the progression of the story. As we see the story progress, the color slowly transitions from warm to cold and blue as there is an increasing amount of violence with each stage.Overall, this film gets a 10/10 from me. I highly recommend it, even if you are sensitive to violence. These are real life occurrences that I think everyone needs to be exposed to so that more people are aware of what happens in other parts of the world."

Nothing intrinsically wrong with telling a boys from the hood gangster story, but its just not in and of itself strong enough to carry the movie. Lil'Dice grows up to be a big boss then gets killed. Yawn. Rocket escapes poverty (I guess) by becoming a reporter. Snore. A bunch of other guys get killed before we have any chance to figure out who they are. Zzzzzz.The music is buried in the background for the most part, and when it takes center stage, it's often stuff like ""Kung Fu Fighting"" which sounds more like Hollywood shorthand for ""the 70s"" than any real attempt to capture what favela kids were listening to back then. I swear it feels like this movie was scored by an American right down to the rustic types playing their little guitars on the street.The acting is fine but can't escape the one-dimensional writing. The Tender Trio are amiable thugs whose roles in this movie are completely superfluous. Lil Dice is 100% bad, Rocket is 100% good, and Benny is so underwritten that we don't really care what, if anything, motivates him. The one character who might have acquired some depth (and around whom the entire movie should have been built) is Knockout Ned, a bus driver who turns into a murderous gangster. He, more than anyone else in this movie, embodies everything that went wrong in the favelas in the 80s--a deadly combination of ex-military and drug gangsters, with the military guys supplying the connections for heavy firearms, the organization to mold the drug warlords armies, and the training to shoot to kill rather than simply spray bullets around. Knockout Ned is portrayed as a ""hero"" of course, even though so many of his kind were anything but heros, taking advantage (and often creating) the total anarchy of the favelas in order to grow rich and powerful.The cinematography often makes this film all but unwatchable. Fast cuts, speedups, filter shots, the abysmal strobe-light sequence on the dancefloor. All of this is crap and totally kills every scene where its employed. The one great scene in this movie (where Lil Dice shoots one of the ""runts"" in the foot, then forces another young kid to decide which of the two ""runts"" to kill) is devastatingly effective because it doesn't use any crap film tricks at all. It's a tense, realistically portrayed scene shot at medium distance which manages in a few minutes to show just how the mindlessly violent generation of the 90s came into being. If the whole movie had been like this, it would have earned all the critical praise heaped on it.But of course, the whole movie isn't like this because the director is too busy showing off his technique to worry much about how the scenes connect. Copying Tarantino's style of putting little titles up for each segment, he seems to utterly forget what story he's telling, jumping around from character to character, and even short flashback loops like the whole ""apartment"" sequence that he seems to think build dramatic tension whereas all they really do is shout ""hey, look at how cool this narrative technique is!"" It might be cooler if we hadn't seen the same ""Lil Dice takes over another dealer's turf"" sequences so many other places. And all the praise about how ""realistic"" this is must be coming from critics who think Quentin's films are realistic because almost all the violence is as perfunctory and fake as any movie coming out of Hollywood these days. In the end, this feels as plastic and stylized as any gangster rock video, and carries the same emotional weight.In short, a real disappointment. Essentially a tired American gangsters from the hood movie shot with a Brazilian setting."
Fong_Chun_Kin,"Jul 29, 2003",8/10,"Perhaps expected too much before entering the cinema. Did not turn out as well as I thought it would.The story is told through the mouth of Rocket, a future photographer who grew up with the hoods in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The narrative style is excellent, the best thing about the film. It throws several stories at the audience one at a time, all linked chronologically and eventually leading back to the opening scene of the show. It's pretty clever and well executed. The acting's top notch too, the hoods feels extremely real, right down to the little 'runt' who cried so painfully when he was shot in the foot.Without doubt, violence is the integral theme in this film. It shocks initially, but numbs you into submission as the film moves along. A friend commented that the only reason why the City of God is named as such is because the people living there get to see God very quickly. It seems inevitable for the boys to succumb to the world of drugs and crime. Admist all these violence it is really a miracle for the narrator to be able to live and tell his story and not get hit by a stray bullet in the frequent gang shootouts. Perhaps this is the fairytale aspect of the movie. The only person who escapes death is the one who has managed not to subscribe to the seemingly unavoidable world of crime.The film should have left a deeper impression in me, but yet it doesn't. I don't know why, but somehow my emotions are not stirred. Are we living in such comfort and are so remote from real violence that there is nothing for us to associate with?"
arlmovies,"Mar 4, 2005",10/10,"The basic story, a boy who is raised in the real world, from the beginning of his life. I believe this is one of the most powerful, and truly realistic stories, that can truly show the hardships of reality, and the decisions given to people, and how they choose to accept different opportunities. When I first saw this movie, I thought it was all those things: powerful,moving, beautiful and all that, but I realized this is a story that should be heard. This story reminds me of Lord of the Flies, with realism in it. This movie deserves all the credit it gets and some, and I hope that the situation that this story follows, one day, will no longer exist: life of violence, drugs, and death."
phreakv6-1,"May 18, 2005",9/10,"I thought Godfather,Goodfellas were the best gangster movies ever made.This movie was comparable and at places even better than Goodfellas.But considering Goodfellas was released 13 years before Cidade de deus puts Goodfellas in a different league altogether.Cidade de deus has awesome cinematography ( Cesar Charlone - Oscar nominated ),totally offbeat editing ( Daniel Rezende - Oscar nominated ),scintillating screenplay (Braulio Montavani - Oscar nominated ) and some good direction.The audio was in Portuguese but the subtitles were pretty good to follow the movie.The movie is styled similar to pulp fiction since the answers are given first and questions asked later in almost all the anachronous sub-plots ( like chapters in pulp).The movie is narrated by Rocket,a journalist who takes just a minor role in the movie ( btw. this is a true story).The story is set in 60's Rio de Janiero and revolves around a ghetto.Its very powerful and disturbing with kids carrying guns and robbing motels, shooting to kill,sniffing n selling drugs.Its somewhat reminded me of Black Hawk Down but this is a war amidst drug lords unlike the war in BHD. ""I sniff,I steam,I kill.I'm man"" uttered by a 12 year old speaks of the way the kids of the ghetto use their pistols as toys. Overall, a beautiful masterpiece that will take you on a time travel to the 60's Rio."
agnesoshinyemi,"Apr 8, 2005",10/10,"At first,I was forced to watch this movie and now,I don't regret it.This movie is something else entirely, but in a good way,a very good way.The movie was made in such a realistic way that for sure,you'll know it's a true story.It's one of those movies that contains all the elements,from comedy(the ending with The Runts) to romance to tragedy,in fact,it's a *must watch* movie.The actors,even with little experience,did their jobs incredibly well.I think this movie deserved the nominations it got but I think it would have deserved the Oscar for best original score.It's a movie that words can't even describe how good it is.I do hope that the actors will get wider recognition and job opportunities in the future and I also hope the same for the crew and everybody who was associated with the making of this movie.In other words it's a true modern classic."
WaltDittrich,"May 5, 2005",10/10,"Just finished watching this great film - 5/4/05. Wow! This was so amazingly great.You can believe all of the 10-star reviews - and look, there are a lot.. Can a movie BE this good?! Yes. THIS is the reason why I watch movies. Think Pulp Fiction meets Amores Perros meets Snatch meets New Jack City - WOW! What a great film! Also note: The only thing mentioned in the bad reviews seems to be the violence, and granted, violence is not for everyone, and the subtitles. Well, the Godfather I and II, widely held as some of the greatest movies of all time, are subtitled throughout quite a bit of the movie. So is Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, and so is Seven Samurai. But you know what? This movie is better than all of them. I'm not saying the best of all time, but I am saying this movie took my breath away. I was on the edge of my seat, never wanting it to end. Yes, this movie deserved all of its award nominations and wins. Bravo! Walt D in LV"
colon-gregory1,"Nov 23, 2024",6/10,"Good film. More armed gangsters appear, and soon the young man and the chicken are surrounded. The young man surveys the area and hesitates. My heart should be pounding, but I remain perfectly tranquil. The ideas and events are in place. This quality of this premise is off the charts. We can already imagine that this film will be about choices that lead people down different paths in life. We envision the different themes emerging, such as the unjust suffering of innocents, like the chicken. This movie should have me on the edge of my seat and on the brink of emotional eruption, but it doesn't. Not much changes during the remainder of the film. The storytelling is phenomenal, aside from a few over explanations via flashbacks. The acting is hit and miss. The characters entice, but fail to completely generate the attachment to them that I wanted to feel. In the word, the film was underwhelming."
bilahn,"Apr 1, 2006",5/10,"Based on the near universal praise from critics and viewers alike and my interest in Brazilian culture, not to mention the buzz about the cinematography, I was eager to see this film, despite my lack of interest in violence as entertainment.I was disappointed on all counts. City of God seemed very amateurish to me, and I am still trying to figure out what is so great about the camera work. Done in a cinema verite style, it never seemed to rise above someone walking around with a video camera. I suppose that is the point, but it was very slack and unintriguing to me.None of the characters really got under my skin, they were merely shrill and unpleasant, and not in a ""good"" way.Most surprisingly, the hype about the violence is unfounded, and I am very sensitive to violence. Yes, there is a lot of shooting, killing, and depraved behavior, but it was presented in a way that oddly had little impact, let alone gore. I felt like I should have been utterly horrified by the scenes portrayed, yet it came across as not credible or realistic.City of God is certainly not a bad film, and it did have some moments of genuine truth and power, most notably in interactions with various girlfriends.My overall impression of the movie: - a noble and decent attempt at movie realism in that ""cinema verite"" style that does not succeed due to the lack of skill of both the director and the actors. Yes, I hear many of the actors were amateurs - but it doesn't work here.Guess I am pretty much alone here - but I will admit that I don't like very many movies made in the last 15 years or so, although there are a distinct minority that I will watch over and over again such is their quality."
Kshalene,"Apr 8, 2005",10/10,"Easily one of the best movies of the year, perhaps the decade. I have not seen a gangster movie with the level of nuance and attitude as City of God. All the of the characters are wonderfully developed and all have their own identity to add to the message of the film. The locations in which the film was shot are almost a character unto themselves and I left wanting to see more of this slum of Rio de Janiero. There is nothing that I can say about this movie other than it is a masterpiece of storytelling and setting... This is the movie that will put Latin American cinema back to it levels of a couple of years ago. Yet City of God moves beyond what Perros Del Amor and Y Tu Mama Tambien ever dreamed of achieving. Go watch this movie!"
morbid_Visions,"Feb 12, 2004",10/10,"I'm sitting here having trouble coming up with the words for this film. From start to ending you're thrust into such a great story (beautifully shot and directed as well) that keeps getting better and really has no slow spots. Another thing I loved is that the subtitling was masterfully done in the aspect that it fits perfectly in the scenes so its nearly impossible to miss action due to reading the titles. The characters are excellently portrayed and you'll just love Rocket, the main character who narrates the whole movie. I just can't describe in words how this movie makes me feel and how just so incredible it is. Everyone needs to see this now for it cannot be missed. Its got drama, comedy, violence, action, everything. So let the screen saver on your comp kick on and head to your local theater and see it NOW."
WordtwisterMN,"Mar 14, 2005",8/10,"I have seen some documentaries on how Brazilian police can storm homes with no warrants. And Brazilian shop-owners will pay to murder homeless children because they steal from them. The movie has an 8.7 of 10 rating on IMDb.com. This is an incredible rating, needless to say. I found the camera work far above the norm. The direction was good, but I felt they stole a bit from Lock Stock and Two Smoking Barrels. Also, the story has been done before...poor community, drug dealing, corrupt cops, etc. I think the movie could have rocked if it was 25 minutes shorter, the characters more descriptive and understanding. After viewing the movie, it's difficult for me to understand how it received such high ratings. I found this movie no where near the top 100. It has no place among the best. The photography alone should not justify an 8.7. The story was full of holes, and again, it had been told before in hundreds if not thousands of other cultures."
kenjha,"May 18, 2007",9/10,"This saga about kids growing up in a violent and drug-infested neighborhood of Rio de Janeiro is fresh and vibrant from its droll opening scene to its riveting finale. It is brilliantly directed by Meirelles, who fuses an innovative story-telling technique with a fine script and terrific camera-work to create a memorable cinematic experience. The tension is palpable throughout, specially in a heart-wrenching scene where one child is prodded to shoot another as a gang initiation ritual. Although the subject matter is violence, the film never dwells on it, focusing instead on characters and circumstances. There is fine ensemble acting from a cast of non-stars."
diemartini,"Mar 3, 2005",8/10,"This film is really good. In spite of that I believe that but the attractive thing that it has is the terrible reality of the people who live in fabela. The terror that inspires a place to us like that. It is very difficult to escape to that terror and that feeling is the one that dominates the film throughout. It gives fear us, scares the reality to us, because we, as much as you readers we lived in a bubble, in a privileged world, where we have everything , or at least all our basic necessities within reach of our hands. Then we see films like these, that they show another reality to us and we were scared, and we are thankful to have the sufficient thing to live and to be able to give our pleasures us. This film is documentary an extraordinary one on the misery of the world, misery that we deal ed with not watching to be able to live peacefully."
laura-vanbaren,"Nov 10, 2008",10/10,"You know, a classmate of mine told me for years I had to see this movie, and since we like the same kind of movies, I just knew it had to be great. Still, it lasted for about 3 years 'til I actually saw the movie.Well, I was totally blown away! I watched it with my boyfriend, and nothing could prepare me for the realistic feeling this movie gives you. Normally, I really don't feel like watching a movie for 130 minutes, (I really think movies shouldn't be any longer than 90 minutes tops, but that aside) but by this movie I didn't want it to end. And that's rather crazy, because it's horrible what you see. And it makes it even more horrible to know that this is what's happening out there. You just know it by watching this movie.I'll never forget a certain scene, involving two little kids and a couple of older kids, where one of the little kids starts to cry so intensely, it breaks your heart. I almost started to belief that this was no longer acting, but that this was what was happening at that moment, but then I thought: no way the director would do such a thing to this little boy, especially when you think about the reason why he even bothered to make this movie.Well anyway, the thing is, you've got to be kind of prepared for this movie. It's no happy ending like we all see in those Hollywood-blockbusters, it's no horror like we see in the same movies, it's no thrill like we see in the same movies and it's even no humor like we see in those movies. Yes, even though the topic of this film is horrible, there's still a sense of humor in it too. And why? Because the director didn't direct this movie from one side of the story, but from both sides. You get to see the reason why those kids do what they do, what happened to them, why they choose to be with this man rather than with the other, why their lives are so bad, they really don't have another choice than this one. And all this time the director stays close with his people; he's not overdoing it. He knows why he's filming this and he knows how he wants to film this and he stays with that. You'll never get the feeling that this is such a Hollywood movie about a terrible topic, that in the end wants you to confess your sins and say: 'Yeah, you're right, we should do something about this, I should give my own life to do something about this.' None of that crap in Cidade De Deus: yeah, sure, he wants you to know what's going on and he's so straightforward that you'll feel like he's slapping you in the face, but nowhere you will find that thing Hollywood-movies do to you; he lets you think what you want to think. Just see and undergo this. Be one of their neighborhood for once. And he did a damn well job!Go and see, really, you'll be blown away."
kgav-20022,"Nov 5, 2017",1/10,"I watched by accident, it seemed like a great idea to tell an story as it is. Acting was very good. But there is too much graphic extreme violence towards little children. I would never watch again and the fact it has so many awards only shows how desensitize our society is. Stay away from this movie."
fchriskoch,"Dec 15, 2011",10/10,"This is my first time reviewing a film in IMDb or any site. This seemed liked the perfect title for me to start with. The reason is because no other film has ever effected me like City Of God.To start off I want to say that like anyone that uses this site on a regular basis,,,,I've seen a TON of movies. From American classics all the way to disturbing Japanese gorefests.City Of God takes every single aspect of modern cinema and storytelling to the peak of what a film can be. A lot of ""normal"" people will immediately stop watching once they realize they will have to read through subtitles. This is one of the most unfortunate mistakes a human can make because of all the amazing foreign films that people miss out on.Fernando Meirelles needs to be recognized as an elite director for making this masterpiece. The film's opening scene with the kids chasing the chicken and shooting at it to catch is perfect. I think the important point of the films shows the innocence of all the characters mixed with the brutality of the environment they are raised in. The violence of it is powerful in certain parts showing how there is no shame or feeling in the outcome of their actions. The scene where Lil Ze catches up with the runts is still one of the most disturbing scene I can think of.The cinematography is in every way what you want. A distinguished look. The colors of every room and street mixed with the time lapse scene in the drug apartment is fantastic.The sound editing and score are perfect for everything you are seeing on the screen.This is really a movie I would and do recommend to anyone that wants to take a change on a foreign film. I have a lot of fanboy movies i love like certain big budget scifi movies from Cameron and Lucas of course,,,but for some reason when someone asks me what my favorite movie is I always come back to City Of God and say its the best. It's not necessarily my ""favorite"" movie because that would be too hard to generalize.So if you come across this online or see it at a video store and your wondering what this is,,,,please give it a chance so your not missing out on a true masterpiece"
NoeMan,"Apr 9, 2004",10/10,"This is without a doubt one of the most brilliant films ever made. It tells the story of a few boys that grow up in the ""city of god"", an outskirt of Rio De Janeiro where the poor live. A city where children carry guns and need to steal to have enough food to stay alive. The boys go in different directions as they grow up, one becomes a photographer while another becomes the most powerful criminal in town. Over 100 people are killed in this movie and many of them are kids so it might not be for everyone.This story is so brilliantly told that I was breathless the whole 130 minutes of it. It´s one of those movies that will leave you thinking about it a long time afterwards. Powerful stuff."
Quinoa1984,"Aug 8, 2003",10/10,"City of God played for months on end at an the Angelika theater in New York City back in 2003, and I was hesitant whether or not I should go there to spend ten dollars and to sit in a little theater with a packed audience, or to wait in video. I gave in to my temptations to see the film, from what I heard from various reviewers, and by the end, I knew it was truly worth the admission, and then some. Director Fernando Meirelles, along with co-director Katia Lund, crafts a film that steams so much with a passion to tell this story, to reveal all these characters (most of which who wear their flaws right on their sleeves like badges of honor), and to be honest with how their tales unfold, that even the most die-hard of action film or gangster connoisseur will feel the visceral, hardcore nature of the City of God long after the lights come up, subtitles and all.This true story (from a novel by Paulo Lins, former resident in the slums) is told, much like Scorsese's master-work Goodfellas, in a kind of flashback format where the narrator takes us back to the City of God when the lower class were shuffled into the slums of Rio De Janeiro without much hope. Our narrator, who only calls himself Rocket until the end, lives amongst the Tender Trio, friends of his whom start out robbing oil trucks and whatever they can get their hands on to stay alive. An impromptu heist at a motel gets the cops swarming, and the trio becomes scattered, though not dissolved. As it proceeds into the seventies, we find out that some members of the group died, a few went to jail, and Rocket stays on the sidelines, hoping to become a professional photographer with little or no assets to become one in and outside of the City of God.Then there's Li'l Dice (played through most of the film by the equally terrifying and gleeful Firmino Da Hora), who in the first act of the film is a kid who's the smallest among the bunch of older teens who make more or less successful robberies, though as Rocket says ""You need more than guts to be a good gangster, you need ideas."" In flashback (not to spoil) we discover what went down at the motel that night, and from there in a brilliant stroke of editing we see how Li'l Dice became Li'l Ze, who rises up little by little in the drug dealing schematics of the slum and soon takes over a supplier to sell cocaine. Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) may be the protagonist viewers can identify with, but Li'l Ze is as fascinating an antagonist as any I have seen in a long time, who masks his insecurities with boyish joy in all of the mayhem he creates. Otherwise without hope, Li'l Ze becomes the dominant supplier in the slums, something of a tyrannical businessman, and as his story unfolds as does Knockout Ned (Seu Jorge), who becomes Ze's rival in the eighties.The only way a movie like this could work is if we feel for the characters plights and heights and such, even if they're evil in nature like Li'l Ze, Carrot, and Knockout Ned. That's why the filmmakers plunge us right into the City of God, and the nature of the city, and while the narrator may pass judgment on people he's known his whole life, he like us know why they're up to no good. The thieves and dealers and killers became such by looking up to their role models, the older hoods of the region, and with each younger group of kids who want to smoke dope and vandalize is another and another. As long as you don't get caught with your pants down by the cops, or get raided by chance, the odds for anarchy are in your favor in such a place. We understand equally why Rocket wants to get out of the city his own way as much as we understand the wars between the gangs, and this crucial facet makes the film work extraordinarily well to its advantage. Indeed, we understand the tragedies of such minor roles as the Runts- the orphans of the streets- much as we would understand the importance of such roles as in a Dickens novel.Along with this technique of storytelling, is the way it's filmed that's eye grabbing. The first scene shows in fast action a chicken chase, and then our hero between the gang and the cops viewed in a tailspin fashion as we are sent back to the beginning. Then, we get all the energy of even the simplest of scenes, and the hidden passion (Rocket on the beach with Angelica, for example) all by the mostly hand-held photography by Cesar Charlone, and the break-neck editing (i.e. the montage of how Li'l Ze makes a name for himself, or the disco dance sequence) by Daniel Rezende."
DennisLittrell,"Dec 29, 2005",9/10,"(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon.)This Brazilian Portuguese language film set in the slums of Rio de Janeiro, the so-called ""City of God,"" is a mesmerizing coming of age gangsta drama second to none you'll ever see. At the same time it is a tale of redemption and the triumph of relative good over relative evil.Representing evil is the psychopathic L'il Dice/L'il Zé (Douglas Silva/Leandro Firmino da Hora), who kills people just for the joy it gives him. Representing the good is the story's narrator, Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), who will grow out of the slum to become a newspaper photographer. And representing something in between is the charismatic Benny (Phellipe Haagensen). The acting is excellent, including that by the ""runts,"" actual kids from the City of God; but what carries the film is sharp direction by Fernando Meirelles from an outstanding script by Braulio Mantovani from a novel by Paulos Lins.I think Hollywood directors ought to note well that it is the authentic realism of the film as seen from within the City of God by one of its own that makes this such a compelling experience for the audience. None of this can be faked. True, the story is a bit romanticized as a (very talented) kid might tell it to his friends, but that is all the better because the world view of those kids is part of what makes this film so effective. Additionally, all the little side stories: the woman at the newspaper who takes Rocket home with her for, shall we say, personal reasons; the story of the girl Rocket loves; the desire of the ""runts' to be men, etc., add layers of genuineness that also can not be faked or dreamed up by any filmland script writer. These things have to be lived.Last time I looked Cidade de Deus was rated #17 at IMDb, ahead of hundreds of great films. There's not much I can add to that. Is the film over-rated? I think so, and I think it will fall in the standings as time goes by. Good recent films tend to get a lot of attention, and then reach their level after some years have passed and they can be evaluated more objectively. Regardless, this is a watermark film for the Brazilian cinema and especially for director Fernando Meirelles who because of it rocketed from obscurity to world-wide fame almost overnight."
roger-pettit1,"Jun 23, 2012",10/10,"""City of God"" is a quite brilliant film that portrays three decades - the 1960s, the 1970s and the 1980s - of child and adult drugs gang warfare in the slums (favelas) outside Rio de Janeiro. Its quality is all the more astonishing given that many of its stars are non-professional actors who seemingly act out their own personal experiences for the camera.The film is set in a crime-ridden housing project known as Cidade de Deus (City of God). It focuses on two young boys - Li'l Dice (who becomes known as Li'l Ze, when an adult) and Rocket - whose lives develop in opposite directions. Rocket attempts to escape the crime, violence, drug-dealing and killing that is the norm for young men and adults who live in Cidade de Deus. He is fascinated by photography and attempts to pursue that as a career. Li'l Dice opts to go with the flow, and with his determination and ambition for power and control becomes a ruthless drugs dealer and eventually the head of one of the gangs that control life in the favela. The plot highlights the turf war that is waged with ruthless violence between the different gangs in Cidade de Deus over drugs, money and (to them, perhaps most important of all) influence, control and power.""City of God"" is absorbing and extremely thought-provoking. Living as I do in the relative comfort of middle class London, I can only imagine what life must be like for the people portrayed in the film. ""City of God"", which seems from this relatively safe distance to be infused with a gritty realism that few feature films possess, makes one realise in no uncertain terms the extent to which all our lives are governed by an accident of birth. How would any of us cope if we were born and brought up in circumstances like those of the characters in the film that are almost impossible to escape from?The narrative structure of the film is excellent. The principal characters are introduced to the viewer one by one and at a particular point in their lives, usually when they are relatively young. The film then returns to their story later on in their lives when they have become more adult and have been exposed more fully to the difficult circumstances which they have to confront head on. There is a judicious use of narration and of flashback, both of which help to explain what motivates each character's actions. The acting, the cinematography and the direction are superb. What is more, the film does not romanticise the violent lives on display. And, (how can I put this without giving too much away?), it does not - as many films of this sort probably would - opt for a wholly redemptive and hopeful ending. Indeed, one of the many messages of the film is how difficult it is to escape from a life of poverty and violence, on a generational as well as an individual basis.""City of God"" is a brilliant, almost faultless film. It's a masterpiece of modern cinema. 10/10."
tjvinod97,"Aug 26, 2015",10/10,"In my opinion, a good movie is one that tells an important and entertaining story, makes you feel a range of emotions and makes you believe and feel for the events that are happening on screen. It should be able to do this by harmonising acting, writing, directing, post production and sound. And when I think about movies that have been able to exceed these expectations, often City of God is one of the first titles that pops up in my head.City of god takes a look at the lives of various kids and teenagers involved in a turf war in the slums of Brazil that spans over 2 decades. Life in the slums, corruption, gang violence and growing up in a dangerous place are some of the themes addressed in the film. It has a unique storytelling structure, transitions from one story of a 'hood rat' (or gangster) to another, before they intertwine in the climax.The characters of the film are amazingly likable and relatable. The slightly psychotic tyrant 'Lil'ze', Peace loving Ned, charming Benny and lovelorn Shaggy are some of the more prominent characters in the movie. My favourite would be Rocket, the narrator. He aims to be uninvolved in the turf war and become a successful photographer. All he wants to do is mind his own business, stay alive and get laid. That's about as relatable character a movie character will ever be. The raw and emotional acting of the cast makes the movie all the more memorable and authentic.One of the main filmmaking achievement of City of god is the way that it immerses the audience in its unfamiliar setting through brilliant editing and music. The famous opening, the 'chicken chase' sequence, is a perfect example of this. The actors, played mostly by residents of the slums itself, provide great authenticity. They manage to provide great, believable acting performances as well, despite having no prior experience in the craft.Despite being an emotionally impactful story, this movie still has several scenes that ooze coolness, without straying away too much from the actual grittiness of the subject material. Also, there are several witty dialogue scenes that help to prevent the film from getting too gloomy. Without scenes like Ned on the bus, Rocket taking photos of the gang and Benny's party, these characters would be mere participants in the harrowing events of the area. These scenes are crucial in highlighting one of the film's main theme: That these hood rats and gangsters are, at the heart of it all, still humans like the rest of us."
gregorybnyc,"Jun 24, 2004",10/10,"I was rather surprised by some of the negative reviews about thisabsolutely masterful film.  I didn't get the connection to GoodFellasbecause while those guys grew up together, they are older whenwe meet them, and their economic environment is very middle-class as opposed to the flavelas of Rio where the grindingpoverty is soul-destroying.The corruption that infects all levels of Rio society is sickeningfrom the drug and gun dealers to the crooked police and even thecynical media.  The scene about the violence in the City of God hasbecome so bad, that the media is now reporting on it, thereforeforcing the police to do something, left me slack-jawed.  This kindof insane lawlessness has to be answered.In the end, this is a movie with a message of  grim hope,astonishing as Rocket has begun to fulfill his dream of becominga photographer.  No such luck falls to Ned whose dreams arecompletely destroyed by the horrible violence of the flavelas withtheir drugs and their indifference to violence.  Any movie thatshows children  wielding guns as though they are toys should bea wake-up call.  It shows how our own indifference to children'sneeds for a good education, loving families, and healthcare is  justanother step in wrong direction of their futures.A though-provoking film that is also riveting in its intensity.  Pleasesee  it."
arisebabylon,"Nov 7, 2007",10/10,"This movie really captured me. I am very critical about certain movies, but this one was so well presented and was so gripping and powerful, there is no way you can't walk away from this movie without feeling like you were there in the City of God. The character's faces will stay stuck in your head for days and you will see Brazil in a whole new light.Perfect film. I don't just recommended this, I urge you to see it. The only movie better than this, IMO and in all of the friends I've shown, is the Godfather. And this movie definitely comes close to beating the Godfather. Hands down it's that amazing."
ineffableee,"Dec 8, 2020",7/10,"One of the most memorable films about life in the favelas. Captivating plot, cool shooting. A film where you have to make an important choice in your life and showing how important it is to go towards your dream"
Dimi1822,"Apr 23, 2005",N/A,"Coming from being a huge fan of the Lord of the Rings series because of its epic and powerful impact, I watched City of God that was set in a closer to modern time and a poverty-stricken location. Even knowing that, the realism and powerful impact that City of God had upon me was at the same epic level as Lord of the Rings. The acting was not the best I have ever seen, although it still was excellent and didn't hurt the movie at all. The emotions that it brought out and the realism that I felt while watching every moment of it was incomparable to any other movie I have watched. It really brought me fully into the action and to the story, and I felt like I was truly experiencing it. It drew me in fully through the end with its Tarantino style story-telling and captivating recollections through the eyes of Rocket the photographer. In all honesty, I almost can't believe it was a movie. It was so realistic and so well done, that it felt like a documentary capturing the true occurrences of every scary and powerful moment of this story. It was that realistic and that powerful, that I couldn't believe behind each scene there was a director coordinating every moment; as it all just flowed so smoothly together from start to finish. Every scene was perfectly detailed and constructed and the director's brilliance emanated from the screen during every minute that passed by. All in all a brilliant creation worthy of the recognition and appreciation it has received from those who have been privileged enough to see and enjoy what is City of God."
saoconrado40,"Nov 8, 2009",10/10,"City of God is a Masterpiece. With all the rubbish that is coming out of Hollywood these days, this Brazilian movie shows that plot and substance will smash CGI special effects any day of the week. Not for the weak of heart, COG is shocking, confronting, and also fascinating. It depicts real life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro, where the horror of drug warfare is juxtaposed with spectacular scenery and beauty. Unlike the privileged few, the favelados are trapped in a vicious cycle of poverty and violence, which is almost impossible to escape from. Hollywood could learn more than a thing or two from this movie, it far surpasses any other action movie of the past decade. Simply a must see. 10 out of 10"
annoman,"Aug 7, 2007",10/10,"One of the most powerful dramas of the decade is 'City of God.' Fernando Meirelles proves that he can run with the most acclaimed directors in modern cinema with this film. His disciplined style is vigorously enchanting as much as it is appealing. For his furious and violent tale, 'City of God,' he portrays, with shocking realism, the slums of Rio de Janeiro from the late 60's to the mid 80's, where crime was the way out and those not involved were the suckers. But among these criminals and suckers is a minority of those dedicated the goodness that is often overlooked in cities as torn as Rio, and Meirelles exemplifies that notion through a young photographer and the story he comes to tell.The film follows a boy named Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues), whose dream is to become an accomplished photographer. Growing up, Rocket was raised in a lower-class quarter of Rio's Ciudad de Deus (City of God), in which most of his peers had aspirations of becoming the City of God's next big thing  whether the path they led was bright or familiar. Among them was Lil' Dice, a young boy who ran with a gang of hoodlums whose main intention was stealing, though had killed before.As years progressed, both Rocket and Lil' Dice meandered down very different corridors; Rocket found fulfillment in honesty and kindness, whereas Lil' Dice eventually found himself the city's most infamous drug-runner, Ze Pequeno, or Lil' Ze. Soon before long, the City of God is ravaged by unseen violence, led by Lil' Ze, and Rocket is capturing the horrific footage via his hand-held camera. While Rocket's intentions focus on keeping down an honest, clean path, he finds that he can make amends with both Lil' Ze and the local police, by submitting photos of Ze and his entourage to the tabloids. Win-win for both, eh? Not quite. Even those who find success, struggle in the City of God, and by film's end that fact is recognized by all  and it's not soon forgotten either.The screenplay, adapted by Braulio Mantovani from Paulo Lins' novel of the same name, allows viewers to relate and reside with its characters and surrender their absolute emotion to a film that exhausts each and every emotion imaginable. Retrospectively, Meirelles' demand for the viewer's attention, through unwavering brutality and almost dizzying camera-work, makes for intense movie-viewing and enthralling entertainment. Additionally, the film carries a surrealistic beauty  and is shot with an overexposed lens that brightens the photography and implies perfectly the authenticity of the beautiful city of Rio de Janeiro  that elevates the heart when the movie reaches burrowing depths. All in all, 'City of God' is flawless; and with an array of resonating performances and flawless direction, it is sure to be one of the greatest films one will ever see."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"May 8, 2006",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The PitsA film set in Rio De Janeiro's infamous City of God, an area in which combat photographer's fear to tread, police rarely go and residents are lucky if they live to the age of twenty. The film opens in the 1960s, where a young Rocket, who is too scared of being killed or hurt to become a gang member, dreams of becoming a photographer later in life. In the meantime, a street gang which includes his older brother, rules the streets, holding up gas trucks and stores. But this doesn't provide enough money, so his gang, along with a young boy named L'il Dice, engineer a raid on a fancy hotel, planning to make off with a good deal of cash but not to kill any one. This plan, of course, goes pear shaped and in the aftermath, the police launch a major sweep on the slum to catch the culprits. But things really heat up when Rocket's older brother has an affair with the wife of a local man and, when it is discovered, is forced to flee the slum and, unfortunately, he doesn't make it out alive.A decade later, Rocket is now older and a bit more guided. But the terror of the street gangs continues, with one drug dealing (where the real money is) gang lead by the irredeemable L'il Ze, who used to be the boy L'il Dice, and his best friend from childhood Benny, and another, ruthless but more rounded gang of drug dealers lead by Carrot. But when L'il Ze gang rapes the girlfriend and kills the brother of a local pacifist, everything culminates into a brutal final confrontation between all the gangs dominating Rio de Janeiro before the cycle of violence starts up all over again.Brazil's Rio De Janeiro is probably one of the first places that springs to mind whenever anyone mentions the subject of gangs and gang violence. And with good reason since it is certainly one of the worst, with such shocking statistics as mentioned above. And, in spanning three decades of trouble and strife in the area, film maker Fernando Meirelles has crafted one of the most extremely thorough, unbelievably engrossing and totally satisfying films you are likely to see, a searing, powerful and at times very disturbing examination of characters caught up in the violence. We have a character, warped and twisted from a young age (who may well have become as bad as he does if he was raised in Swindon instead of Rio) and who grows up to show no signs of changing down his road of evil (managing one or two distressing scenes along with it.) Another character part of the cycle of death and violence but who still manages to come off as a nice, affable guy all the same but who's fate is sealed when he tries to find a way out. Another character who, even on the path of retribution, tries to stay ethical and remain a good person but who circumstances dictate ends up becoming as bad as those he's going after. And one last character whose own weariness of violence and single ambition is probably what keeps him on the straight and narrow till the end and produces probably the only happy ending in the film. Other than that, we finish on a scene of a group of young street orphans roaming the war-torn streets, talking about how the money's not in robberies but drugs, and that the mostly tragic events we've just seen are about to repeat themselves in a film that could be exactly the same.IMDb users generally know what they're talking about, and they've voted a most satisfying film in at #16, a mostly downbeat and disturbing but still sweeping, soaring and utterly absorbing account of a place where misery and bloodshed is doomed to continue, which sweeps by at just over two hours (even quicker on second viewing) and also boasts a fine soundtrack to boot (including the ultimate one hit wonder Kung Fu Fighting.) What film-making is all about. *****"
Quebec_Dragon,"Jul 23, 2009",9/10,"City of God refers to a crime-ridden slum suburb in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. This movie follows the lives of several children and teenagers living there from the end of the sixties to the start of the eighties. I found this crime drama more shocking and disturbing than many traditional horror movies. Why? Because most of the characters in there are totally amoral and compassion-less, even enjoying their foul deeds. Worst, some of the offenders are children. There's not much gore but it's very violent and feels very realistic.Most of the actors are unknown and their acting is not noticeable as acting, feels very natural. It's like you're a voyeur of something you wouldn't want to be stuck in. All the characters except perhaps a couple are not likable at all yet they're fascinating to watch. The story based on a book based on true events is gripping and really well told with separated titled chapters (such as the Story of Knockout Ned). The directing is top-notch with some dynamic camera work and sharp editing (already visible in the chicken chase introduction). If you're interested in organized crime movies a la Goodfellas mixed in with some Tarantino style (not the dialog though) in a poor Brazilian hood, this powerful movie is for you. I always find it ironic how gangsters are so religious yet commit atrocities. It's even more ironic in this seemingly god-forsaken ill-named city of god.Rating: 8 1/2 stars out of 10."
ramamendez,"Feb 27, 2016",9/10,"This is maybe one of my favorite movies. It can kick the big ass of the most films of Hollywood. It's a shame that it didn't win an Oscar.Very well-appreciated if you really know the Rio de Janeiro's situation. I should advice that I'm a huge fan of Brazilian movies and maybe I'm not being honest but seeing the average rate of that movie I think I'm not wrong.The story is very well-told. Director show selected moments of each character life which are very necessary to understand the thing. Unfortunately this is the true story of this people, growing-up by corrupted politicians.Let's enjoy this great movie. :)"
Marc_Israel_365,"May 27, 2012",10/10,"Brutally honest and crude, Fernando Meirielles movie, born and filmed in the Brazil slums, raises above pure cliché and inevitability. You can either be a hood, a policeman or a worker, routinely victimized and barely able to scrap a living. The experience is hard to watch at times and at others artful and fun. This is brilliant storytelling through the combination of editing, vision and narrative. The result is how personal the story becomes through the eyes of young Rocket, our protagonist photographer, whose simple desires seem to be cruelly thwarted as if this is what all kids in the favelas experience. Following the decades' trends, we see the rise and fall of the angry and insecure gangster, Ze Pequena, possibly the scariest of gangsters ever to make the big screen. Gritty and a real as it gets, City of God translates as a cool gangster film as well as a very well told universal story of survival."
Cocacolaguy912-2,"Jul 9, 2007",10/10,"City of God falls under the pile of unflinching movies, movies that aren't afraid to be brutally realistic. If you are going to tell a story about gang wars, corrupt police, and hardship, you can't make it PG-13 and turn your camera every time someone gets shot. That just feels so fake. It is fake! This film tells it like it is. It is true to the story and to life. That is one reason I think City of God is great - its upsetting and powerful because it is furiously real.The other reason is simply because the story telling is excellent. Very excellent. Fernando Meirelles does an excellent job weaving the plot between the many different characters, and time periods. Not to mention the great acting, cinematography, and pretty much every other technical aspect.City of God is a 10/10."
NihadRogue,"Sep 22, 2025",7/10,"City of God is a gripping and intense crime drama that portrays life in the favelas of Rio de Janeiro over several decades. The story follows the rise of young characters, particularly Rocket, an aspiring photographer, and the violent criminal Lil' Zé, showing the harsh realities of poverty, crime, and survival.The movie isn't flawless. Its rapid pace and frequent time jumps can be confusing at times, and the sheer number of characters makes it hard to keep track of everyone initially. The violence is graphic and relentless, which may be disturbing for some viewers. Additionally, a few minor characters are underdeveloped due to the film's focus on the central narrative.Despite these issues, City of God excels in storytelling, cinematography, and realism. The performances, largely by non-professional actors, are raw and authentic, capturing the desperation, ambition, and humanity of the residents. Fernando Meirelles' direction is dynamic, using creative camera work and editing to immerse viewers in the chaotic, dangerous, and vibrant world of the favelas. The narrative is compelling, emotionally engaging, and unflinching in its portrayal of the consequences of crime and violence.Overall, City of God is a powerful and unforgettable film that combines intense storytelling, strong performances, and striking visuals. While its violence and complexity may challenge some viewers, the movie's energy, realism, and emotional impact make it essential viewing for anyone interested in gripping dramas or world cinema.I wish the viewers a good time."
ackstasis,"Feb 9, 2007",8/10,"Planned and executed by the state government of Guanabara, the quarter of Cicade de Deus (City of God) was built in 1960 as part of a policy to remove all favelas (shanty towns; slums) in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. ""We came to the City of God hoping to find paradise,"" reminisces Rocket, our narrator. ""Many families were homeless due to flooding and acts of arson in the slums the big wigs in government didn't joke around. Homeless? Off to City of God!"" Nowadays, Cicade de Deus is infamous as a high crime quarter, rife with social problems. ""There was no electricity, paved streets or transportation. But for the powerful, our problems didn't matter. We were far too removed from the picture postcard image of Rio de Janeiro."" Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund's acclaimed Brazilian film ""City of God"" dares to veer from this ""postcard image"" of Brazilian life, creating an intense and uncompromising glimpse at life in the violent and drug-infested slums at the heart of the city.The story, which spans the 1960s and 1970s, follows two parallel lives in the Cicade de Deus. Rocket is a quiet, honest boy who dreams of becoming a photographer. Whilst nobody in this city is truly innocent, Rocket perhaps comes closest. His father was a fishmonger, and the older brother he respects, Clipper, is a hood (short for hoodlum) who  with two other close friends, Goose and Shaggy - forms the Tender Trio, who acquire their money through theft.The second child is Li'l Dice, who will later rise to be known as Li'l Zé. An ambitious young boy who often trails the Tender Trio, Li'l Dice attains his first experience of murder via a shockingly revelational flashback. Li'l Dice subsequently grows to become the dominant drug dealer in Cicade de Deus, after successfully eliminating most of his competition and taking over their businesses.Perhaps the first thing you'll notice about this film is that it is visually stunning. César Charlone's beautiful hand-held camera-work perfectly captures the beauty and horror of Cicade de Deus' chaotic everyday occurrences. Whilst sometimes you feel that the camera darts all over the place unnecessarily, this also offers the film a documentary-like feel, brutally reminding you that this is based on a true story.'City of God' is an unapologetically intense film, and it certainly is not for the faint of heart. The overwhelming combination of violence, drugs and rape (and the very idea that children as young as ten or so were taking part in all of this) made me nauseous at times, and I would be lying if I said that I enjoyed watching this movie. It was a rewarding experience, and I'm glad that I did watch it, but I can't say it was fun. In fact, I felt quite depressed afterwards. Yes, I suppose this just isn't my sort of movie. For what it's worth, I much preferred watching Fernando Meirelles' follow-up film, 'The Constant Gardener' (2005)."
moneystacks511,"Aug 23, 2007",10/10,"All i have to say is that from the first time i saw this movie, i felt it was one of the best i had ever, ever seen. Just an extremely powerful, funny, sad, and overall amazing piece of work.I can't believe that most of these kids had never acted before, their performances were so good. Many powerful scenes and great interweaving of the story and its characters. This film also made me a big fan of Seu Jorge along with the life aquatic. I saw him live in concert a few months ago in Chicago and he was great! Im not a big fan of subtitled films but this movie is so good you don't even realize that you're reading it. A great great movie, a perfect 10! If you haven't seen it, or you have but you've got friends that haven't, sit them down and watch it with them!"
wwillems,"Feb 6, 2006",8/10,"Very tough movie portraying the lives of kids/teenagers in one of Rio's favelas. What I liked most about the movie is the way in which it is told, through the eyes of one of the kids who manages to escape the harsh reality of the favela. I also like the flashback following the opening scene in which a group of kids tries to catch an escaped rooster. The freeze-frame shots are very nice as well. It is a very fast paced movie and sometimes it is hard to keep track of all that is happening especially because the movie covers a couple of decades. I saw this movie after visiting Rocinha in Rio the week before. I did not realize until after having seen the movie that Seu Jorge plays the role of Mane Galinha. He makes beautiful music these days and one of his quotes is really frightening ""The other actors were ... curious. They wanted to know if the favelas are really like that. I said unfortunately they're much worse."""
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 17, 2005",10/10,"""Cidade de Deus"" (called ""City of God"" in English) knocks the breath out of you. This story of life in Brazilian slums makes you feel like you're in the slums with the characters. It follows Rocket (Alexandre Rodrigues) as he grows up in these places, and then joins a gang. You see, in these slums, either you join a gang or nothing ever becomes of you. So, Rocket is pulled through a world of drugs, violence, and every ugly thing that you can imagine; it's his only ticket out of complete isolation.I figure that some people would jump to call ""City of God"" a Brazilian ""Mean Streets"". Methinks that such a description doesn't suffice. This movie is far more profane, far more graphic than ""Mean Streets"" (although they both treat the same kind of subject). Of course, it's extreme, no-holds-barred portrayal of the desperation and violence of this existence is what makes this movie so good. I think that Brazilian Pres. Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva actually praised the movie for its accurate portrayal of life in the country's slums. I don't know the slums personally, but either way, prepare to have the breath knocked out of you."
chubbydave,"Aug 31, 2013",10/10,"This movie is a story about some people living in a Rio de Janeiro favela called A Cidade de Deus. It's an actual place built about 50 years ago that's one of the most well known favelas in Brasil.It's more than a story about gangsters. It explores the feelings and motivations behind the characters from the guy who seemed to be born to kill to a guy who worked hard at a job, had a girlfriend and nice family but joined a gang for revenge after becoming a victim of crime. It explores the different people living in the neighborhood from the kids to the gang members to the parents working hard at menial jobs trying to make ends meet. It's an interesting introduction to the culture.The movie is in Brazilian Portuguese but is available with English subtitles which is why I wanted to see it as I am trying to learn the language.An interesting fact is that a resident of this favela just won the world judo championship in her weight class. A decade ago while living in a Cidade de Deus, Rafaela Silva and her sister Raquel were discovered by some guys interested in developing the sport in Brasil. Over ten years later she becomes the first Brazilian woman world judo champion."
Nitun_007,"Jan 12, 2025",8/10,"The film is based out of a slum in Rio de Janero, and it does an excellent job of capturing the life in the area. The way the film is edited, the camera motion makes it feel all so real. The cinematography here is thus excellent, though it's not exactly my taste. Poverty, drugs, rampant violence in the area are well captured and we get to witness how little kids are sucked into notorious culture that surrounds them. It is disheartening to see this but well, it's true and represents the story of a lesser known side of Rio and many similar places all across the world.The cast can't be praised enough, considering they were all amateur actors who managed to put in an amazing performance to deliver a a maybe not so heartfelt story and I think forgot to mention the director's approach to storytelling in this one was great."
Screen_Blitz,"May 31, 2016",9/10,"Not many crime films come as dark, gritty, or even violent as this one. And unlike most crime stories set in America, this film paints a brutally honest picture of the harrowing lifestyle that dictates the third-world country of Brazil. With the visceral direction by Fernando Merielles and Katia Lund, viewers are dragged into a grueling but significantly honest experience of the difficulties in growing up in a world where violence and crime is practically a way of life than an obstacle in society. Set in the 1960s and 1970s, the film takes place in Rio De Janeiro which most people refer to as City of God, a poverty-ridden city in Brazil where employment is very low, the crime rate is devastatingly high and just about everyone from young elementary-school age children to adults carry a gun. Those are not employed resort to robbery and murder for financial support. Enter Rocket (played by Alexandre Rodrigues), a young boy growing up in the violent slums of Rio De Janeiro with the dreams of becoming of a photographer but finds his future obscured by the everyday crime including the robbery and homicide by his brother Goose (played by Renato De Souza) and his gang. Competing with his gang is Lil Ze (played by Leandro Firmino), a young boy with a thirst of violence who grows up to work his up the crime ladder to become the leader of the most dangerous gang in Rio De Janeiro. As these two gangs cross paths, the result is a war that spirals gravely out of control.This film is in no means fun to watch, it is extremely violent, brutally somber, and at times incredibly difficult to sit through. But the most earnest quality here is: it's authentic. While most crime films deal with characters getting involved outside the law to achieve something of their desires, this film tackles crime as a natural societal lifestyle simply because it takes place in a town in Brazil where violent crime is a composition of their society. And it doesn't try to glorify violence but to show the inhuman consequences that result in such heinous activity. Whenever a character, major and minor, is killed you can't help but feel deeply for the character, and the emotional resonance delivered in these scenes never feel forced. As the story moves, you watch as the main character develop from a boy struggling from moral ambiguity and the overwhelming influence of his fellow friends who rely on firearms to squeeze their way out of unwanted situations, to a young man who begins to realize the damage it causes him and roots for a better future. The outcome is one powerful character granted by an ingenious performance by Alexandre Rodrigues. The most compelling feature of this character however, comes from his conflict with Lil Ze and his gang. Leandro Firmino gives a intriguing performance as Lil Ze, a sociopathic young man wrapped in his own bloodlust since childhood and with no desire other than to be the most feared man in town. If you are not disturbed by flashbacks of him as a little boy shooting a man and woman while laughing like a child watching a clown at birthday party or a youngster forced to shoot a little kid in the foot, I don't know what will. The conflict that embroils between him and the main character Rocket provides a visceral tension that moves the story very well while paying plenty of emotional investment.City of God is a deeply riveting drama that leaves a powerful impact very few can deny. This is a film punctuated with astounding performances, solid writing, and an ultimately uncompromising direction. It is disappointing that this film was overlooked for an Oscar for Best Picture nomination, though it is likely due to the grim material. The film is worth watching but perhaps not one you'll want again after first viewing due to the dark atmosphere and overall brutality."
zorasmoon,"Jun 24, 2005",10/10,"The cinematography, score, story-telling & casting were all done to perfection.Finally, a movie that uses editing after-effects in support of the film, as opposed to style without substance.And this was based on a TRUE story, too? The poverty, class gap, racism, violence and police corruption---- you'd think the implications would be huge. A POWERFUL film.Highly recommend watching the documentary found in the Special Features section.Best Foreign Film I've seen to date."
cobizer,"Aug 2, 2005",10/10,"When a friend recommended I watch this movie, I wasn't all that excited. Subtitles? Call me when the dubbed version comes out. Against my will I watched this Brazilian flick anyway and was pleasantly surprised. The cinematography alone in this movie is worth watching it. Even if you are not interested in violence, Brazil, or (gasp!) subtitles, the camera angles, lighting, and innovative use of handy cams are stunning. The movie has a real documentary feeling to it and features characters that you actually care about. There was not one death that occurred in this movie that came as a relief. I was actually emotionally attached to all of them. (Even the ones that may have deserved a violent death.) To top it all off, the story is extremely complicated and in-depth but is told so well that it is never confusing. Go buy this movie, it's too epic for a rental!"
Heikki-Tulokas,"Dec 20, 2005",9/10,"We are often warned about the dangers in Brasil. Thank Goodness, I didn't watch this one before my first trip to Brasil. But afterwards, it is a hypnotizing film. The changes in time makes you follow the movie more carefully, you don't want to miss the action. The violence in the movie, yes, it is a very violent one, is not the same kind like in the Hollywood-films, or in some raw European modern movies. It doesn't play with the amount of blood: When they shoot someone, you get the idea without slowmotion close-ups! It's better this way. I like the simplicity of the Brazilian actors. No over-acting is needed, this is a movie of the life in favelas as it was, or even is today, as I have heard."
george.schmidt,"Mar 5, 2003",N/A,"CITY OF GOD (2002) ****  Matheus Nachtergaele, Seu Jorge, Alexandre Rodrigues, Leanro Firmino da Hora, Philippe Haagensen, Johnathan Haagensen, Douglas Silva, Roberta Rodriguez Silvia, Alice Braga .  Absorbing and compelling tale of young Brazilian boys who grow into gangsters/drug dealers and other dregs of society in the ghettos of Rio de Janeiro circa the late 1960s/1970s era that focuses on one attempting to leave his dead end environs by  becoming a photojournalist and for pure survival at all costs. Astonishing in its matter-of-fact violent bluntness that sends a shock to the senses to see pre-adolescents brandishing all sorts of weapons and killing for the fun of it; rampant anarchy peppered with moments of innocence.  Filmmakers Katia Lund and Fernando Meirelles  transcend the feel of a docudrama's trappings in their adaptation of Paulo Lin's true-life account of the mean streets of Brazil with a decidedly improvisatory screenplay adaptation by Braulio Mantovani.  Kudos to the inventive cinematography by Cesar Charlone and  energetic editing by Daniel Rezende that owe much to Scorsese, Tarantino, and PT Anderson for its storytelling through flashback cuts , title cards, character intros,  and overall mise en scene yet has a unique, original feel altogether as well.  A truly excellent piece of dramatic filmmaking."
EdgarST,"Dec 22, 2003",6/10,"Some people have complained of the ""Hollywood treatment"" this story (inspired by real events) received, and it can't be denied that most of its stylistic flourishes resembles senseless action films. Somehow, though, the violence depicted in the movie has no ultimate sense, no other purpose than to follow the flow of daily life in the slums of Brazil, even more when it has been decided to disconnect the events from the social and economic structures of the Brazilian society. (Compare this movie with Héctor Babenco's ""Pixote"", and you'll see the difference.) It is obvious that some persons who are not aware of those conditions may find the images too raw or blame them on the characters' psychopath behavior. But then (I hope) neither we find reasons for the behavior of Quentin Tarantino's or John Woo's characters only on individual psychological terms. In the end, it's such a harsh reality that the cynicism of the filmmakers and all their flashy and effectist resources (like the change of music and the introduction of a strobe light in a party, just before one of the less repulsive young criminals is killed) end buried below the piles of dead bodies of Brazilian children and adolescents."

Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not- existent. A cheap, cheap movie that to the greatest irony won so many undeserving awards. People who raved about this film are idiots. Critics too. It is just pathetic. Even Hollywood movies are one hundred times better as much as I don't like them."
DarylKMiddlebrook,"Sep 18, 2015",10/10,"Set in Brazil in the 1970s, the film tells the story of Rocket (Alexandre Rorigues in an excellent, understated performance), a teenage boy living in an extremely violent area of Rio de Janeiro called The City of God. Like most boys his age, all Rocket wants is to get laid, smoke a little blow and chill with his friends. However, the violence around him not only complicates this it throws him smack dab in the middle of it. When he loses his low paying job, he watches with envy the carefree life of the drug lords Lil Zee and Benny (Leandro Firmino and Phellipe Haagensen respectively) who run the ghetto. They flash money and ride brand new motor scooters through the streets of the hood. When he loses his girl to the more enigmatic gangster Benny, Rocket declares in frustration, ""It was like a message from God: Honesty doesn't pay, sucker."" Seeing delinquency as the only way to prosper, Rocket decides to pursue criminal ventures of his own. Fortunately, Rocket and his equally square buddy, prove to be the most inept of criminals. They don't even have the heart to rob a lost drunk who has unwittingly gotten lost in the slums. Rocket soon resigns himself to the fact he's no criminal. He's one of the nobodies. One of the thousands whose fate is in the hands of a few crazy fools with guns. Luckily for Rocket, fate was waiting around the corner with a better hand for him to play.Thanks to his love and expertise in photography, Rocket is given a brand new camera by the violent Li'l Zee. For Rocket, the camera is a life changer. It doesn't matter that the camera was bestowed upon him simply because none of Lil Zee's lunkhead bangers knew how it worked. He's been given an identity, something to separate him from the masses. A possible way out of the slums of the city. When Lil Zee ""commissions"" Rocket to produce a series of photographs of his gang, the pictures mistakenly fall into the hands of the local newspaper. When the pictures of Lil Zee and his gang make the front page, Rocket fears that his life is over. Instead, Lil Zee glories in the publicity and sanctions Rocket to take even more photos of his criminal inner circle. Soon, Rocket has becomes the City of God's chief correspondent.City of God is filled with a hefty supply of violence, including some pretty cruel things done to children and women. However, the film still manages to leave the viewer mesmerized by, or despite, the chaos and anarchy. Along with the grand performances of Rorigues, Firmino and Haagensen, City of God is filled with memorable characters and performances, such as Seu Jorge as Knockout Ned, who becomes Lil Zee's nemesis for control of the ghetto. Young Douglas Silva, who plays Lil Zee as a boy is spellbinding as well as a little scary. Performances such as his and the others is what makes this film a casting masterpiece. Due to the lack of black actors in Brazil, Directors Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund decided to use untrained youths and kids from the actual City of God. This obviously adds to the sense of realism that is the film's strength. Credit must also go to screenwriter Braulio Mantovani, who paints a vivid and honest picture of a violent, desperate world very few outside the slums, would ever see or know existed. Telling the story through the eyes of a young dreamer, who's day-to-day existence was never a guarantee is a stroke of genius. The story doesn't attempt to pull on the viewer's heartstrings with melodramatic scenes or narration. The audience is simply allows to flow with the story, as one would in real life. The viewer is transformed into an unseen companion to the hero Rocket's actions, vision, and emotions as he navigates us through violent menagerie of the City of God."
oriyon8,"Mar 25, 2006",9/10,"Best foreign film i've ever seen including ""Y tu mama tambien"" & ""Crouching tiger hidden dragon"". Though set in the slums of Brazil, the ideal of lost youth and dead-end circumstances are experiences world round. But this film also revels in it's depiction of Brazil as a universe. A place most of us see as serenely beautiful, but underneath it's post card image lies all these dangers.You follow a young man as he tries to find his way through all the tragedies surrounding him. A maniacal young drug dealer, a righteous hero who somehow becomes the own evil he tries to fight. It's also amazing because this is all based on actual events. You really can't help but feel each gun shot as if the bullets were piercing your own flesh. There are some brief periods in the film where i was genuinely uncomfortable, but comes with the territory i guess.Wonderful film, greatly recommended."
mp65steady,"May 26, 2002",9/10,"My first reaction to this engrossing, thrilling, gutsy AND witty drama about ghetto life in Rio de Janeiro was: WOW! What a movie. It takes you for an unrivaled trip to the youth ghetto of Rio, the so-called ""City of God"". We follow the lives of some kids, who grow up in the late 60's - most of them don't live to experience the 80's. The only, or let's say: the fastest way to get out of these dumps are violence and drugs. Using violence and pushing drugs. You better not mess that order up, or you're done. While debutant Fernando Meirelles shows the incidents in ultra-realistic (and therefore mind-numbingly brutal) fashion, he nevertheless achieves great art by splicing up the story, going from the present to the past, using newest technology wisely, speeding up the tempo with great ease, but also slowing down whenever he has to and showing the ability to be tender. He teases the audience with hints about things to come, and when he gets back to those things, he always delivers in a big way. The film has about a dozen important characters, and it's amazing how Meirelles not only manages to introduce them with style, but also keeps track of them so that we always know who we are dealing with.Since there is nothing I could compare this film to, I'd like to say that it comes close to Scorsese's ""GoodFellas"". Ok, that is a totally different world, but it's just that Meirelles uses a similar approach: He doesn't feel superior to the people he's showing, and he doesn't judge them. He shows them and their actions, counting on the intelligence of the audience to understand the motifs, the short-comings and the needs of the characters on its own. Most importantly: He shows us violence in a way that is not cool. It hurts seeing those kids throw away their lives by falling to the way of the gun.So far, this is the biggest, most welcome surprise of the year. Let's just hope that the sometimes over-anxious marketing department of Miramax, which bought the film in Cannes, will be sensible enough not to over-hype ""City of God"".9/10"
mikayakatnt,"Oct 16, 2019",10/10,"Hands down one of the best crime films out there. I enjoyed the story-telling, grittiness, and abject realism of this film. There were moments where I forgot that I was watching a work of fiction.I recommend this film to all my friends and anyone reading this review. The story picks up from the moment the camera rolls and doesn't stop until the credits roll. The realism captured in this film leaves little to the imagination.10/10. Would watch again."
jasonupah,"Jun 10, 2016",10/10,"City of God stands above many other movies.Above all, I think the storytelling is done in such a way that keeps the viewer engaged and on their toes. It's like Reservoir Dogs with flashbacks that seamlessly integrate into the story; in fact the editing strengthens the experience.City of God does have child actors but man, they don't feel like it. The acting is so natural and so organic. The entire movie has got a different vibe than your typical Hollywood product.Use City of God as a gateway to other international movies. There's a whole world out there - see this movie!"
SPZMaxinema,"Apr 5, 2022",8/10,"The characterization and drama in this movie was done quite well. While I didn't like some of the directing techniques with the camera-work in some moments, in other moments it was directed quite well! I liked the ending a lot with Lil Z's demise and the twists that took place, plus how the cycle of a life of crime that infested the streets got passed down to yet another generation, quite a powerful movie! I would've never thought that I'd like a film quite like this!"
vivacco,"Feb 11, 2005",N/A,"I just saw City of God late last night. I don't think I'd ever even heard about this film before seeing it. What a surprise! Let me tell you, this is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen. It jumps out and grabs your attention right from the very first frame of film. The backdrop, the images, the directing, the acting...all incredible! Watching the acting, I thought to myself ""this is amazing how well they are acting."" I suspected that most if not all the people they used in the film really did grow up in that environment. They just acted too good. They were just too natural with it.One thing I kept thinking while watching this film was ""I thank God I wasn't born and raised in this environment."" The movie makes you realize how good you've got it. How would you like to live in a housing project where gangs of thugs walk around carrying ""Rambolike"" machine guns, with ammo belts hanging off them, openly without fear, ready to shoot and kill anybody just for the fun of it, having no remorse? How about kids 12, 13 and younger running around with real pistols out in the open, ready to blow you away for kicks? This is a housing project that truly is and looks like a war zone.The culture of these people just jumps right out at you. It's exciting, depressing, thrilling, chilling all mixed up well. I thought Rio was mainly just a huge beach with a bunch of super exotic naked women walking around, guys staring, and a huge statue of Christ overlooking it all. This movie showed me different. A lot different! You've got to see it! Viv"
Jacobdk,"Jun 18, 2003",6/10,"With nothing but rousing praise leading me into the theater, I should have expected such a disappointingly inauthentic and stylistically inappropriate film.  City of God is not half as depressing as others suggest, or as it should be, and the dialogue throughout is embarrassingly generic.  It had a glossy texture with doses of disturbing violence mixed into a mostly nostalgic and derivative coming of age story.  While I was never bored - there's certainly no lack of action or story telling energy - I never felt connected to these one-dimensional characters (except sometimes Benny).  People are introduced and killed off before we could ever feel emotionally connected to them (in this way the comparison to Pulp Fiction is valid, though Pulp Fiction was PULP, and this is supposed to be a meaningful film about the plight of street kids in Rio).  Overall, it's a big budget after school special. For a real film on the subject check out Bunuel's Los Olvidados."
mtaraskevicius,"Jun 14, 2008",1/10,"If you like blood, violence, death, seeing people being rapped and murdered, then this is the perfect movie for you. I could not finish watching this movie because it is so graphic. What a disgusting movie! I regret watching 1/2 of it. It makes me embarrassed to be Brazilian, because it makes it look like we are all criminals. I would NOT recommend this movie to any normal person, avoid it like you would avoid the plague. You can show violence without being so graphic, they showed a really bad rape scene. What is going on with some Brazilian film makers? There's no need to so something like that. I cannot understand why there are so many people who love this movie, maybe they are nutty!"
GavAnderson,"Sep 4, 2005",10/10,"'City of God' is hands down, one of the best films ever made. The script is brilliant, the story brutal, and the acting first class. Its stylish, sharp, and hard hitting telling a story of what life is like in one of the world's most notorious slums. It reminds me of 'Goodfellas' in many ways, only it's a whole lot better. Fernando Meirelles has an awesome style, his directing is fast paced and stylish from beginning to end I especially love the way he skips back and forth through time in order to tell every aspect of the story. It is a very stylish film but it also has a heart, it has a story to tell, a story worth watching. 'City of God' is unlike any film I have ever seen, it is so rich is visual beauty, and is flooded with bold originality. You will struggle to find any better, it's a one of a kind movie, that doesn't cease to impress."
nicoleakoukouthompson,"Feb 28, 2015",10/10,"""City of God"" was stunning and powerful feature, and it's the film that changed the way that I watch film. Everything about it was stirring and emotional, and it taught me about the realities that other people experience in other nations. The vibrancy of the film is only matched by sharp acting on behalf of the child actors, who deal in violence, survival and power in Brazil. The movie is truly unlike any other I've ever seem, and it's almost insane that the movie, based on the book by Paulo Lins, is based on the writer's life...and his experiences amid the slums of Brazil. This film most certainly deserved to win bigger award than it did because it's a movie that someone can walk away from feeling disturbed, but educated. And that's powerful."
cvetanstoyanov,"Feb 23, 2023",10/10,"I saw this movie in december of 2020 and I can still remember all of the scenes. Never have I saw such a good movie. The acting,cinematography,music,setting is just phenomenal. The story goes as smooth as butter. I amazed by it all. This is my favorite movie of all time. It doesn't bore you and keeps you watching. The scene at the dancehall was truly amazing with its lightning. The beaches shown were amazing. The time period of the plot was really well integrated. The way of life in the favela was perfectly shown. Thank you Fernando Meirelles,Kátia Lund and all of the cast for making this masterpiece."
cmapbh,"Dec 3, 2002",10/10,"City of God is a excellent movie! Fernando Meirelles did a perfect job in the direction, the characters are very touching and real. The story isn't fiction and its the best movie ever made about the war in the Brasilians slams. For the Brasilians, its a movie to open our eyes and see our reality, we really are in a war, but we try to not see. For the foreigners its a movie to show that Brasil isn't only samba, soccer and mulatas. Its violent, but if the reality is like that, its better don't hide!"
katyabeck,"May 27, 2008",9/10,"I was thinking about a blog I wrote recently with my top ten movies of all time. My curiosity led me to check out where IMDb rates this movie. I was pleased to see that others enjoyed this as well.Though it's been a while since I watched Cidade de Deus, it makes me squint my eyes in thought and I become intrigued all over again. From the pulsing music and lights of the outside discotec scene to the irony of opportunity mixed with corruption, this is a fantastic film. To all of you who are nervous to watch films with subtitles, unless you can't read quickly at all, don't be afraid to check a movie like this out. If you have any sense, you'll be so entranced that you forget you're reading the subtitles altogether.I wish there was a way to rate this in between a 9 and a 10. A 10 is hard to come by but it's damn close."
widescreenguy,"Jan 15, 2007",7/10,"the abundance of handguns says it all.they are very deadly, and the scene where the young hood kills all the people at the hotel and smiles in a flashback is typical of the motivations of far too many hoodlums. they kill not in the course of committing a crime out of necessity to carry out the deed, like shooting an armed security guard, no, they kill for fun and because no one can stop them in the moment.I have fired handguns but not recently, and only at a target range, so I understand the dangers of the bullets flying out at a thousand feet per second. once it leaves the barrel anyone in front is doomed. and the finger pressure to make that happen can be done by a child.city of god should be a warning to us all on the costs of crime and violence. building a city, educating the young and creating conditions that give them job opportunities takes a long time and a lot of work; this is why so many choose the 'easy' way of crime.it is also telling that at one point you start to lose track of who is in what gang and what they have done, and then all the even younger hoodlums get guns and start shooting up the place. and then subtly the action moves into the big city, they are no longer in the shanty town.a depressing film but one that should be seen at least once.I definitely wouldn't rank it so high up in the top 250."
Robby_V,"Sep 13, 2005",4/10,"I just watched this one and I just sat there watching 130 minutes of kids playing Indian vs. Cowboy with real guns. I did not get a single thread of emotional bonding with the characters or any of the events. This belittles all of what happens in the movie and even manages to reduce the most dramatic scene of the movie(initiation of a new member into the gang) to nothing more then one more kid shooting a gun.The story is sad but nothing original. Rise and Fall of gangsters, rivalry over territory and someone who managed to stay sane amidst all this. Kudo's for some of the camera work and directing but thats about it.Oh and please will somebody tell Meirelles that guns actually have recoils and not just say bang and flash a bright light. The scene of Ze returning to the brothel to 'have some fun' almost made me laugh if I wasn't crying for the pathetic efforts of gun-effects."
sandnair87,"Feb 8, 2016",10/10,"Brazillian director Fernando Meirelles' splashy feature debut is a dynamically exciting portrait of Rio de Janeiro's violent gangs - a blood-spattered, non-stop ride as much into the life of a 'favela' (squatter settlement) as it is into the lives of the youths who inhabit it.The methodically constructed screenplay is narrated with subjective clarity by Rocket, a young aspiring photographer caught between his deadly surroundings and his treasured sense of ambition. The movie's principal characters, growing up in the Brazilian slum 'Cidade de Deus' in the 60's, are a bunch of drug-peddling, gun-toting hoods hell-bent on revenge - with the notable exception of Rocket, who would rather aim a camera than a shotgun. But Rocket's tale is only one of the dozens of stories 'City of God' juggles with equal aplomb. From the breakneck opening involving a chicken on the lam, the film throbs with several stories: two and a half hours fly by fast and bloody. There's Knockout Ned, a quiet ex-soldier who believes that education and honest work will get him out of the slum. There's Li'l Ze, a vicious drug kingpin with a frozen heart, who erases the Tender Trio's early thug-life template with a psychotically itchy trigger finger. There's Benny, the grooviest hood in the slum, who attempts to retire from Ze's drug game and then there's the hood with my favorite moniker, Steak'nFries, all locked into a headlong dance of sex, drugs, and violence.City of God is an unmissable cinematic triumph, peopled with affecting characters that avoid cliché, and a familiar story signposted with brutally shocking punctuation. Basing the story on real events and people, the makers employ a host of young non-professional actors residing in the slums where the story takes place, who perform a spectacular job under Fernando Meirelles' brilliant direction. Meirelles illuminates every frame of this fresh, ferocious and indelibly moving film that moves at whiplash velocity thanks to a terse script. He endows each chapter with powerful, uncompromising, beguiling and, sometimes, deceptive momentum. In a film of battering audacity, no shock hits harder than the way Meirelles choreographs murder to a dance beat, an exuberant form of kiddie recreation.But for all of the story's violent subject matter, there is also much natural beauty to savor thanks to the dynamic cinematography that captures Brazil's magnificent landscape. Every aspect of the filmmaking exists as a virtuosic symphony of theme, character, context, and style. The style is all dazzle and in-your-face pizazz, quick titles, cuts, and digressions, split screens and smash zooms, while a remarkably complex story unfolds and the funky soundtrack grooves along - all that dazzle serves a purpose.To watch 'City of God' is to become submersed in a hidden culture where life is cheap but the humanity is vibrant. It is a devastating epic about the roots of criminality and the ironic cruelties of life that also works as an intimate personal drama."
raphaklopper,"Apr 16, 2013",10/10,"CITY OF GOD, critically acclaimed, loved by many, considered the best movie in Brazilian cinema, this is all true ...? Yes, probably.Many people told me that this movie was a MASTERPIECE (agree), others said it was too exaggerated (shut up), well, here's what I think! This movie is EXCELLENT, period. Shows what life is like in one of several favelas of Rio de Janeiro for these children and young people growing up in a world of violence.Buscapé (main character) is a boy like any other that has dreams to realize: be a reporter; having a girlfriend; cash in his wallet. Dreams difficult to achieve in this slum standing gang war between Zé Pequeno (also main character) and Mané Galinha, for reasons both territory and personal revenge. Where we see also the lives of many people in this slum, his experiences and his thoughts on life as they have. And the most impressive in this film is the casting.In the film we can only see a maximum of 2 actors, because all other characters including the main character, are even people who live in the favela City of God, and they make everything real (the film is based on true events if you do not know). In the end, this movie is fantastic and truly a classic!"
AhmedSpielberg99,"Sep 19, 2018",9/10,"Superb editing, and Fernando Meirelles splashy direction made this movie visually stunning, and this was necessary. Because without being so, City of God wouldn't have been the easiest hard-to-watch movie to be watched! I know that sounds weird, but I'm not kidding this movie is so disturbing and shocking, but its vibrant visual style made it impossible to look away from.Like the visuals and colors, the soundtrack is so vivid and dynamic to mirror the vicious cycle of violence in the eponymous city, and the slums of Rio de Janiero.That being said, City of God's exhilarating visuals and soundtrack aren't the only, nor even the main two reasons that made it unbelievably engrossing. As what really dazzled me the most this masterpiece is its narrative control. Considering the fact that this movie has this abundance of characters, which all of them are almost equally important, and a non-linear storytelling, it's beyond belief that I haven't felt lost even for a moment. Instead, I found myself caring for each of the main characters for equal measure. Every time our protagonist, Rocket mentions one of the new important characters while narrating the story, I start getting worried a bit because I think this would harm the narrative thread of the story, and make it lose its balance a bit. But every time I ended up being totally wrong till I eventually said to myself: ""More characters, please!"" By the way, the use of voice-over narration in this movie is exceptional!Every single character is as grounded as its compelling and throughly interesting. And they are brought to life by some of the most authentic, honest, and uncompromising performances I've ever seen in film. All the non-pros actors delivered downright terrific performances that I really can't single hand one of them.The only issue I've with City of God is its first fast-paced 20 minutes. Putting aside the magnificent opening scene, everything in the rest of the first fifty to twenty minutes happens very quickly that kept me from being engaged from the start.Powerful, visceral, uncompromising, yet honest, Cidade de Deus is a Latin masterpiece, and easily one of the this century's best movies, so far. I really regret not seeing it till recently, it's a MUST-SEE!(9/10)"
manoj-mack,"Feb 5, 2016",9/10,"I would say this is one of the best movie I ever seen. when you talk about cinematography, editing and story etc.it amazed me how many different characters plays in this film and how well it has been structured.one of the styles I find fascinating is that it started from character and it passes to the other. Styles its amazing. I really how like how their friends leads to different life styles. the main protagonist Rocket, when he first saw photo camera that how that turns a different path in his life. and in the last scene when he(Rocket) was stuck in-between the cops and goons. I love how the effect and transition which goes to flashback, it was really nicely done. I didn't know much Rio but after seeing movie I would say it gives me overall information about how the people in Rio."
dfranzen70,"Jul 1, 2016",9/10,"City of God (2002, ***1/2) is a brutal look at the drug wars fought in Rio de Janeiro's slums over a period of several decades. It's not always an easy film to watch, but it's utterly gripping and (improbably) humorous at turns.The movie centers on a boy/young man named Rocket (Buscapé in Portuguese, the spoken language in this movie) in the titular slum, the wrong side of the tracks in Rio. Rocket's older brother is in a gang called the Tender Three; this trio commits armed robbery but gives at least some of the proceeds to their impoverished brothers and sisters. The gang's not for long in this story, as one of their sidekick Little Rascals, Li'l Dice (Douglas Silva) has higher aspirations; soon he – under a new moniker, Li'l Ze' – is the top kingpin in the City of God. Ze's chief rival, as time goes by, is a ginger-top named Carrot (Matheus Nachtergaele). As Carrot and Ze' fight each other for control of, well, everything, Rocket tries hard to stay above and out of the fray. He's not entirely successful.The movie is quickly paced. If you don't pay attention you may lose track of who's who, if only because there are plenty of supporting characters. Alice Braga, niece to one Sonia Braga, plays a one-time love interest for Rocket. Hers was the only familiar face for me, but many of the fine young actors (or nonactors, as the case may be) offered compelling standout performances.And this was all based on a true story, as they say. During the closing credits news footage, including interviews with gang members, is shown. The real Rocket appears, as well. Most striking? Might be the group of little kids known as the Runts; this cohort robs, maims, and kills everyone they can – ostensibly under the control of Carrot, but truthfully subservient to none. Close your eyes and imagine a five-year-old kid shooting someone in cold blood. That was this slum in this time period."
imdbfan-6646544255,"Apr 4, 2025",10/10,"City of God (2002) is a 10/10 masterpiece-explosive, gripping, and utterly unforgettable. Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund craft a crime epic that pulses with life, energy, and unrelenting tension. Set in Rio de Janeiro's favelas, the film tells a brutal, heartbreaking story of survival, ambition, and violence, all through the eyes of Rocket, a young boy who dreams of escaping the chaos.The kinetic cinematography, raw performances (many from non-actors), and sharp editing create an almost documentary-like realism. Every moment feels authentic, every scene crackles with intensity. City of God isn't just a film-it's a gut-punch, a wake-up call, and a cinematic triumph. Pure brilliance."
sveniverson,"Mar 31, 2010",10/10,"This movie is now #17 on Imdbs all time list of greatest movies, and deservedly so. It is a realistic and gripping view of gang activity in Brazils, Rio De Janero. The realism is brought out by the amazing performances of the authentic and unknown actors.The movie is based on the true story of gang activity in the slums of Rio De Janero. The story follows the main character Rocket as he struggles to get away from the violence and drug activity of the slums he lives in. He tries to use his love of photography as a way to achieve a life away from the slums.If you are a fan of foreign movies or movies on gangs and crime, this is a movie you can not pass up."
moritzherz,"Apr 14, 2023",7/10,"City of God is brutal. You see kids getting killed, drugs getting consumed and there is in general a lot of violence. The title is ironic, because in a city like that, there is no god.The movie tells stories about different important people living in the City of God, mostly drug dealers and gang members. The focus is on Rocket who later is a photographer.The most brutal thing about this movie is, that it is reality. In Brazil these events happen on a daily basis. This is the bloody reality!Eatching this movie made me thankful of growing up in Europe. I think everybody should be grateful for the life he has, you may not be rich but if you compare your life to that of many children of brazilian ghettos you should be thankful!However this has to end someday, because there are dying innocent people and children every day. This movie created attention on the topic around the whole world and therefore is rightfully rated so high. Please watch it."
=G=,"Jun 10, 2004",5/10,"""City of God"" is an old story. So old, in fact, it begins in the 60's as it tells of gangsters in a Rio de Janeiro slum who do what gangsters do and have done everywhere for all the same reasons. Poverty breeds ignorance which breeds hopelessness which breeds desperation which breeds crime...etc. This film shows us nothing new, save the location and its paper thin characters, as it takes the audience into a slew of favela-dwelling punks with guns (so many it's hard to keep track of who's who and who killed who for what reason) as it attempts to impart a sense of warring in the Rio ghetto. You'll see such a convoluted mess of gang bangers there's no time for the film to provide character depth or a sense of the gangster ethos or the mechanics of the drug trade or a reason to care who lives or dies, etc. Just a whole lot of killing with numbing excess and only a hint of a human story. For reasons I am unable to deduce, ""City of God"" received raves from all corners and countless awards and noms. Go freakin' figure! Personally, I found the documentary piggy-backed into the DVD more interesting than the film and the one scene from the film I remember most (it was shown twice) was that of a chicken which was run over by a truck but escaped unscathed. If you like your street punk killing flicks with subtitles, go for it. (C+)"
evanmarkpirone,"Sep 28, 2015",10/10,"Exhilarating on the first viewing and constantly rewarding there after. City of God epitomizes bold and invigorating storytelling both in its cinematic style and its narrative. The film expertly depicts the chaotic favelas of Rio De Janeiro, a place otherwise referred to as the 'City of God' — ironically so due to its complete lack of justice, laws or sanctity.An epic story of crime, drama and passion unravels through the eyes, ears and camera lens of protagonist Rocket — an adolescent man in his appearance, equipped with the innocence and moral fibre of a young child. Fuelled by his own desire to survive and chasing his dream of becoming a photographer, we follow his journey on the brink of life and death as he is caught smack-bang the middle of relentless and violent gang discord.Technically, the film is second to none, displaying a flawless combination of cinematography, editing and sound. Its cuts are rapid but sleek — possessing some of the most innovative and exemplary transitions in contemporary cinema. City of God's filmic style puts our eyes deep within the perspectives of the favela, entrenching us with the climactic and high-strung nature of the surrounding characters.Overwhelming is the film's ability to so rawly portray the brutal nature of the world and setting, but even more astonishing is its capacity to harmoniously intertwine these elements with the feel good nature of Rocket's coming of age story. Our heartstrings are toyed with time after time, never knowing what to expect; danger, hilarity or sweetness? Our expectations are in a constant flux of surprise. If any analogy were to accurately fit such a feeling, it would be alike to the two directors Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund placing us in the front seat of a rally car with no seat belt and GPS — leaving us to guess in an anticipation as we're helplessly thrown about by the momentum of the narrative, never knowing quite where the bumps and falls will appear.This stands as a recommendation to anyone who wants to be blown away by a compelling story, set in a unfamiliar and hostile world. Or alternatively, individuals who are yet to be wowed by the magic that foreign films can possess."
Rickting,"May 27, 2016",10/10,"There are awesome movies and then there's City of God. Whenever you think this brutal and devastating drama about crime in a violent neighborhood in Rio de Janeiro and 2 boys and the paths they take is dropping the pace, becoming unrealistic and going into cliché, it delivers another one of its many brilliantly directed, heart- stoppingly tense set pieces. Or another one of its quiet, beautifully written and acted character scenes. Or another one of its raw, blisteringly intense emotional beats each of which knock you out with the force of an onslaught of ballistic missiles. The actors here put many far more well-known actors to shame with their convincing, brilliant performances, while the visuals are endlessly inventive and compelling. This is a drama which doesn't hold back on any level and is filled to the brim with thought-provoking moments and compelling characters. It's a tough watch, but it's not completely depressing. It has many moments of warmth and humour, and thanks to all that tension even works as an enjoyable action movie. A fantastic film which demands to be seen. There's a good reason why this is so high on IMDb Top 250, and I hugely recommend seeing this instant classic.10/10"
mauriciofarias,"Sep 22, 2015",9/10,"City of God is a movie that tells a fictional story inspired by the non-fictional book by journalist Paulo Lins, portrayed as the central character, ""Buscapé"" Rocket, and former resident between the 60's and the 70's of the ghetto that shares its name. It develops in a flashback with alternate points of view that disassembles and exposes the parts of the cycle of violence which hasn't yet passed, at least not until the year 2015 when I write this critic. Foreign viewers can compare it to a documentary. For the Brazilian, it offers a production comparable to a great American action movie with good plot, but in a universe with which we can identify. The most shocking scenes can haunt some people for some time, but do not overlap in the movie, being well dosed with funny and uplifting moments. The pace is frenetic. The camera movement is agile and spontaneous, though it seems precisely planned. The soundtrack is a compilation of popular music that must be subtitled in foreign versions to fully justify its part in the movie.It's undoubtedly one of the best movies of this generation in Latin America."
gmoja,"Jun 4, 2024",10/10,"130 minutes of Raw, gritty and masterful story telling. Keeps you breathlessly glued to the screen. Its a visceral masterpiece of Brazilian cinema. One of those movies that leave a lasting impact on you.The cinematography of the film is raw and visually stunning and unorthodox like Tarantino, going back and forth in time and freezing frames. Its a bit of a Brazillian ""Goodfellas"". Depicts not only the horrendous systematic corruption and violence in the poverty stricken slums of Rio de Janeiro but also the moral decay on the individual level much like Tropa de Elite but with its own unique flavour to itIf haven't seen this amazing piece of art that do yourself a favor and GO WATCH IT...!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
david-553-388956,"Jan 8, 2016",9/10,"I hadn't heard that much about this movie before I saw it. But I think that was a good thing. When I saw it I didn't have any expectations, which is rare when you are in to movies. Usually I look up a lot of information about the movie, watch the trailer a multiple times.I'm gonna say that I was pleasantly surprised. It was really captivating and I'm gonna say it's one of the best movies I have seen. Because it's in Portuguese it feels so much more authentic. Foreign movies can be a little bit more difficult to understand, because they make movies differently in different countries. But this movie was one of a kind. It feels so real and it shows how life in a different part of the world can be. Even if you come from the same place you take different paths and that leads you to totally different places. As long as you want to do something you can do it.Because it's in Portuguese it make the movie as good as it is. I strongly recommend it."
IMSandman,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"I give City of God a brilliant 10 stars.I rented this DVD solely based on seeing the high score it received here on IMDb. It currently ranks in the Top 20 movies on here of all time and rightfully so.If you are a fan of Quentin Tarantino, then without question, you definitely need to check this film out. While Quentin did not direct this, the style is very similar to most of his flicks. In fact, ""City of God"" far surpasses anything done by QT.This movie has it all... action, suspense, comedy, gangs, mystery, drugs, violence and even a little romance thrown in here and there.The entire movie is subtitled, but the film is so good that you will be forgetting that the subtitles are there after 5 minutes or so.Finally, the film is completely original and there is nothing out there that closely resembles it. The characters and the acting are superb. These are seriously some of the best characters to ever appear on the Silver Screen. You'll love some of the characters, hate some of the characters, but you will be emotionally involved with all of them due to the superb writing that went into the script. It's a great movie and I highly recommend renting it ASAP.Happy Viewing!"
elkaz6,"Aug 13, 2004",N/A,"This is a great movie. Made with a very low budget. A movie that made Tom Hanks say he was in awe of. Outstanding. Touching. A movie also about hope. But I'd like first to address the two bad comments out of the over 300 in the board. One gentleman complains about the subtitles. Well, it really is frustrating to see in this day and age this kind of comment. It is so revolting to hear this sort of statement. Everybody else in the world when they watch American movies watch them with subtitles. But there is an anti intellectual bent in America (quite ethnocentric) in which movies made in other languages have to be dubbed to obtain any kind of box office success. To this gentleman I'd like to say that the Iliad, The Odyssey, the Bible, Crime and Punishment, 7th Seal, and many other works of art were not done by Americans. Yet we all enjoy them. So I'd encourage him to expand his mind and enroll in a Spanish 101 class in the local community college. Specially considering that the idea behind the global market of ideas is if we want to be heard we must hear others. This sort of dumb a** bs I read on these boards just p** me off. If you are an idiot without any kind of appreciation of what's good and beautiful stick to War Bus and Beach Babes from Beyond. If you don't like a movie because it is in another language don't watch any foreign films! (stay ignorant about the world) rather than watching a movie and giving it a bad review because it was not in English. There is another cat calls himself webmaster 49. The guy gives every movie he reviews a bad rating (including The Pianist, Chinatown, Taxi Driver). But he gives Mr. Goodbar an outstanding review calls it one of the best movies of the 70s. Dead man walking he also praises. So don't be tricked by these two. Their sense of aesthetics cannot be defended with any sort of rational argument. Don't be fooled by them. This is an outstanding movie."
Pedro_H,"Dec 26, 2004",7/10,"The violent, and often shambolic, life and times of the Rio de Janeiro favela (or slum) told from the point of view of two contrasting former schoolboy friends. Filmed in the modern ""shaky hand-held camera"" fashion to give it a documentary look-and-feel.(Something we will return to later.)The great problem with the English speaking mass cinema audience is that they rarely go anywhere abroad outside of tourist traps and have little interest in the Third World. Well outside of outrageous disasters - whether man-made or natural - which quickly slip from our TV screens or newspapers within days of their conclusion.Therefore when cinema takes a stroll down these new avenues it comes as a complete surprise to the virgin audience who get the full head trip. So Brazil is not all long beaches, endless samba beat and sexy girls in dental floss thongs? Well I didn't know that! Shock! Horror! Something must be done!(IMDb always seems to give a bonus mark for a new and different location - Cidade de Deus being only the latest recipient.)For most this product will be the only education about the Brazilian favela (slum) that they will ever get - but at least it is a believable portrait. Nevertheless it is not the last word on the subject and covers only limited ground. Indeed it is a classic example of a film that starts well - loses its way in the middle section - before it arrives at the only climax (and closing impression) which is conceivable.A bit more social context about Brazilian class society would have been welcome - but maybe the budget didn't run to it. Not travelling back in time. This film's idea of background detail is a lone period car! We needed the ""other Brazil"" - but, baring a few voice-over references all we get is a few token scenes in a supermarket or in a newspaper office.(The media types are shown as friendly, warm and caring in perfect contrast to the police who are shown as being totally corrupt. Almost on a parallel to the gangsters. I wonder which camp the writer comes from?)This film has been compared to Goodfellers, and I can see why, but it isn't really in its league. If anything it is a home movie version of the Scorsese classic and needs constant voice-over and subtitles in order for it to make sense. Even with it I was lost several times, but that may have been trying to keep track of too many characters that looked - because of the passing of time - nothing like they did when first introduced!The plot is curiously male orientated when sex is not involved. Do these gangsters not have mothers, sisters, social workers, teachers or sensible relatives? The types that crop up in 40's Warner Brothers gangster pictures to give balance to the criminals and their life views. Overall the script spends too long in the gang hut with the venom-spitting hoods who alternate only between loading weapons and smoking dope.There is no real conventional acting in this movie, there is no need for it. Ducking, diving, shooting guns and looking scared is not that hard. Yes it convinces, but stupid/reckless/desperate Third World people are hard to pin down, how can you say anything is wrong? They march to a different drum.Here leadership seems awarded for recklessness as much as brains, but they have nowhere to go and little to say. Why should they? They have no education. There is only one business (drugs) and there is only one punishment for those that go against the interests of that business.(Once you establish life is cheap and taken on a whim, you don't need to go there again unless it is essential or part of the grand climax.)I am not all that fond of hand-held camera work. It allows you run around and this only results in lots of scenes of people running around. This establishes it as a real location, but doesn't really add any sense of composure. There are times when I feel I was running with the gang as part of it - while I really wanted to be a cold and distant condemning witness.Yes there is lots of questions, quibbles and short comings, but it is a powerful and thought provoking film. But it rather suffers from the Holocaust syndrome: It is hard to criticise the film without seeming to attack the honourable subject. Maybe director Fernando Meirelles has something - he certainly includes some masterful scenes here - but the limited characters overstay their welcome. I wouldn't want to watch it again."
slowboatmo,"Jun 3, 2008",1/10,"An awful, awful movie. Like one of the viewers said, it is cheap in all aspects. To those people who haven't seen this film, please stay away from this junk at all cost. Go Watch some wholesome, soul-lifting contemporary Russian art movies like the Return and then see how cheap this movie is. But this is totally a piece of stinking garbage. Violence need not to be portrayed in such an outlandish, vulgar style. The camera movement almost made me throw up. Editing is almost not-existent. A cheap, cheap movie that to the greatest irony won so many undeserving awards. People who raved about this film are idiots. Critics too. It is just pathetic. Even Hollywood movies are one hundred times better as much as I don't like them."
jmpicasso,"Aug 14, 2005",10/10,"Dear brothers and sisters:First: ""City of God"" isn't one ""favela"" - they are even worst. ""Cidade de Deus"", as a matter of fact, is homemade project built by Rio's State officer in the middle of 60's, for replaced people from ""favelas"". Second: This movie is very far from a gangster one. Is really based in a own experience contained from a book's writer. His idea was show what is a reality in a poverty place like that, so don't take as a gangster movie or some. I'd rather saw it as realistic third world vision of them ones. Third: translation to English or any other language don't catch it. Some gigs, idiomatic expression or passages are funny only in a Portuguese spoken in Brazil. I doubt about his force in Portugal...I don't think they can ""really"" able to understand it. We spoke very different Portuguese..just like English spoken in USA to UK, for example!!!!Bye!"
acrighto-24997,"Feb 4, 2016",10/10,"Set in the slums of 1960s and 70s Rio De Janeiro, this masterpiece somehow manages to be both a romantic coming-of-age tale, a brutal drama, and an action-packed gangster movie all in one.The cinematography is a visual feast and the palates used for the different eras of the film help define the climate and mood of the neighborhood at that particular time. Very well done. The visual style of the film is both exciting and innovative. Not the controlled camera movements of a slick American mafia flick but instead seems to be inspired by the rhythm of neighborhood in which the film takes place- very frenetic, raw, and loose camera-work that feels like a documentary at times while seamlessly sneaking in extremely stylish homages to gangster films of the past.The cast- which seems to be full of mostly non-actors and unknowns outside of Brazil- seems to be expertly chosen. There isn't a single second of the film that isn't believable.If you haven't seen this film yet it should be at the top of your list. Easily one of the greatest films of all time."
ultimoteimoso,"Apr 5, 2006",9/10,"I'm an American living in Brazil for 5yrs now. I watched the movie on TV the other night and was very impressed with it. The quality was very good and gives you the feeling of actually being there and viewing it first hand. The movie depicts life as it was and still is. The people here are generally extremely poor and desperate. The corruption within this country can be found in ever level of Government and under the table payoffs are a way of life for many. Life is cheap and large numbers of people across the country die a violent death every day. Drugs are prevalent and a big money maker for the drug lords. Every kind of drug can be found being sold on the streets. The poorest of the drug users use a cheap drug by-product which make them easy to identify as their front teeth are missing or black and rotting away. Others walk around sniffing glue. Certain areas of Rio de Janeiro are controlled by the drug lords and their followers just like it's depicted in the movie. They have a small army of very young children working as runners taking orders and delivering the drugs to the waiting customer. In those areas it's not uncommon to see even the children walking openly brandishing a firearm. Even the military and police hesitate to enter these areas as it closely resembles a war zone. What you will see in the movie, believe it, because it is NOT an exaggerated fictional movie. These things are happening in cities all across Brazil every day. On the flip side the majority of people here are very kind generous loving families. They are very religious are honest hard working people. The students work extremely hard to get good grades so they will be able to win a full scholarship to attend the best universities in the nation. Just because someone lives and grows up in a favela (slum) it doesn't mean they condone the lawlessness. Some do become great leaders in every walk of life. I can honestly say I know some of them and am very proud to be able to call them my friends. Watch the movie and I can guarantee you'll be stunned and left thinking about it for day with a sad heart that this exists in our world."
theLRGdon,"Jun 29, 2005",10/10,"wow, this movie is presented very real and done with style. The gritty reality of city of god can be summed up with the shooting of the young child in the foot. with that it becomes very clear that this war extended to everyone, and that moment captivated the crowd into this reality. Then you have the constant hits to the style of the time within the seventies. where it was a time to be ""groovy"", and that is portrayed within Benny, as it gets you captivated into this culture. And yet the conflict with Benny and Lil ze is not mainly what resulted into his death. That feel of the seventies IMO is greatly portrayed within the movie, and sets up a great vibe.A great movie all in all, me being only 15 this is a great movie to see and be able to analyze"
Erniehem2,"Apr 1, 2005",10/10,"This is quite possible the best foreign I've ever seen. I'm a fan of Fellini, of Bergman, they were artist and insightful philosophers, but the gritty reality of City of God is fascinating and unparalleled.The arch of the story and the complex interweaving of the lives we follow resembles mythology, yet this is true and it's modern. Modern Non-Fiction Mythology (which I do see is a contradiction of terms, but I don't know how else to verbalize what how I feel about it).The direction was masterful. Fernando Meirelles and Kátia Lund are equal to a Brazilian Sergio Leone. This is what Leone tried to accomplish with 'Once Upon A Time In America.' He failed. Meirelles and Lund succeeded.This movie will satisfy almost any film lover. If you like films for gangster action, if you like it film for story, or catchy dialogue or for deep philosophy on life and the surrounding world, you will love this movie. Even if you don't like subtitled movies, I will give my promise that you will like this."
Kop_Reaz,"Mar 2, 2015",8/10,"I don't know how to begin. It's one of those films you can't explain easily to anyone else but yourself. Then you have to, yes you have to watch City of God just once in your life.It's a different kind of cinema. Different than your regular average shoot 'em up. Sure it doesn't offer that kind of vibe at first. But if you see through the whole movie, you won't regret it, just have to stay focused on the on screen stuffs.If I ever learn Portuguese, it would be to watch this movie again. It's kind of shame that I had to keep reading the subtitles, when the real deal was not in it. Don't want to perform any further autopsy on this decent and entertaining piece of art.Final Verdict: 9.0/10. A super powerful slap across the face of Hollywood, where you can witness about 10 failures to create a realistic and gun fighting film every year."
tluke25,"Mar 6, 2007",10/10,"The movie FLOORED me! Without a doubt one of the greatest films ever. I will guarantee even Spielberg and Scorsese completely flipped out when they seen this.I cannot believe this was not nominated for best picture. This was easily the best film of the year. LOTR: Return of the King won that year and I can understand finally giving those movies their due, but to have Lost in Translation considered the second best movie that year (which I do adore) . . . but Translation is a script that easily could have been written in 2 days and filmed in 3. City of God is a towering achievement. What an unbelievable script with perfect casting and where they found all these actors (including the runts) and made everything feel so real - and like you were right there . . . gritty yet with beautiful cinematography.In this, there are characters you will love to hate (Li'l Ze), Characters you will admire (Rocket and Benny), and characters you will root for (Knockout Ned).City of God is just like the Middle East. You can always take out one leader but there is always someone from the generation younger waiting to step in and do the same . . . they learn it all from seeing everything around them. There will always be chickens (good metaphor used in film) and runts running around to catch."
PIST-OFF,"Nov 25, 2005",9/10,"it's been a while since anything with the violent intensity of ""city of god"" has come out in the united states. this film definitely marks a good start for the director Fernando Meirelles and his use of film technique that is very similar to David Fincher, David o Russell, and Guy Ritchie. lots of frantic energy and cinged colors. one of the movie's main antagonists Lil Ze runs around like a miniature rabid Samuel l Jackson circa pulp fiction. the story centers on the criminal lives of children and young adults in Rio de Janeiro. i think that the movie while never making a political point of it lends a good amount support about just what type of anarchy results from the failed international war on drugs, including but not limited to: the creation of a black market, that gets increasingly violent as it is cracked down on, corrupt police tactics, an excess of wealth and desire for firearms for criminal purposes, international civil unrest, and a broad tool that the have-not in society may use to fore-go education in favor of black market profits. all that nonsense aside, this film is powerful in several ways.the young actors really really manage a tremendous job of translating raw emotion directly to the screen. i'm not sure to many young American actors could have pulled off such a feet of acting. is it even acting? the wonderful pacing and extensive use of flashback to move the movie through a great narrative direction. the setting itself, much like the french setting in ronin, adds a lot of detail and quirkiness to the way the film looks and the overall feel. all these things come together quite wonderfully for one of the best movies i've seen in a while. the only thing i missed is the fate of the lovely angelica is never revealed or mentioned, she simply disappears from the narrator's life and from the film. with the exception of that i i think the film was nearly flawless. this in comparison with the recent viewing of the french movie ""those who love me can take the train"",and it looks like France's future as a leader in good cinema is uncertain at best and unimaginable at worst.9 out of 10"
alexlaradiniz,"Mar 11, 2004",N/A,"I watched ""City of God"" and I remembered a scene from ""Robocop 2"", when the movie tried to shock us showing some kids robbering a shop wearing baseball shirts. Now I am laughing about that stupid scene, it was so unreal..! So different about that scene that shows a child being encouraged to shot another one in ""City of God"": that is real! Some people did some heavy critics for the movie of Fernando Meirelles because of the violence, but it is true, that is real! Brazil still have problems like this, it is a mix of the pooverty of Africa and the power of some strong economies of Europe. Despite of these, in defense of my country, I can say that we are a very talented people with a very good future appearing at the horizon...About ""City of God"": that is the masterpiece of a re-borning movie making. Very violent, but true. If you want to know our beauties, you can search for movies like ""O Quatrilho"", ""Deus é Brasileiro ('God is Brazilian')"" or ""Bossa Nova""."
PurityofEssence100,"Oct 6, 2002",6/10,"Once again an entrepreneur has managed to turn the misery ofthe Brazilian slums into an exportable commodity.Slickly packaged within the ultra violent veneer of the postTarantino gangster genre City of God is replete with bullets,bodies, and just enough flesh to keep the international distributorshappy.It's an epic covering decades and including a good portion of theBrazilian population.  It's also aggressively aware of the latestvogue of digital effects and story telling digressions (ala GuyRitchie's Snatch).  Everywhere the camera and narratorbackpeddle through the third world carnage.  At one level, the rollercoaster pretense is intriguing.  However, given the reality of thesocial catastrophe lying at City of God's core the movie issurprisingly trite.  If you didn't know the police in slums of Brazilwere corrupt then this movie will be an eye opener.  And, despitethe fact that hundreds of those killing and being murdered arechildren the film lacks any connection, and any real humanity,beyond the level of the most superficially apology.  It's excitingBrazil is capable of depicting the slaughter of it's people in suchan eye popping manner.  It's to bad this film fails to connect withwhat lies at the heart of the matter."
mcjensen-05924,"Aug 29, 2021",2/10,"Well you're in for a 2 hour shootout here. It's not entertaining in any way. From the history of the characters growing up to how they ultimately met their decline, it was just redundant and amateur film making. The dialogue must surely have been written by 10 year olds trying out their first swear words, and man oh man do they continually repeat them. It's threats then violence then threats then killing, and people falling dead when they're hit by gunfire in laughably absurd and unrealistic ways. Extremely childish. Childish writing and directing, and all the so-called adults in this mess act childish too. It ultimately just became rather humorous it was so bad, and faded into the background as I started getting distracted by other things. It's a case of a point being hammered home so many times it loses it's power and eventually all anthenticity. It could have been a gritty portrayal of that part of the world and that type of life, but ended up failing in every aspect for me. Very poor choice of soundtrack also detracted from any possible enjoyment. I've seen exemplary films from Brazil. Funny how they never reached the level of acclaim this film did. Sadly the real talent in this business never floats to the top because what's wanted is overdone nonsense like this. I gave it a star because the squalor of the city is showed realistically, but that was purely by accident."
isaacch-99917,"Jun 30, 2016",10/10,"City of god is a different film. Its one of a kind. There aren't many films like it. There is a fair bit of criticism standing against this movie. Such as it being too violent, not appealing to everyone or it being in Portuguese, therefore being subtitled. Without these factors 'City of god' is an almost perfect movie. I don't mind those factors. I don't mind it being violent or being in Portuguese , just that some people do.Its a long movie, that makes a lot sense, its incredibly interesting and its got a bit of everything ,due to the unclear plot. The child actors in the movie are also very good.This makes it even better. You can tell the film was very well thought out, with great ideas and really well made with an obvious large amount of effort put into the making. The ending is really good an ends the movie perfectly.'City of god' also widens your awareness massively of the poverty, drugs , police abuse and general danger young adults and children experience in these environments and developing countries. This film was set in Brazil. Despite all the violence, the movie is being looked at from the perspective of a non-violent individual.I recommend this movie for any adult , due to it being a bit too much for children. GREAT MOVIE DEFINITELY WATCH IT"
Rabsi,"Jul 8, 2013",10/10,"For almost 4 years now, Die Hard had been the greatest film I had ever seen. It was top of my list of films, and it always shone as the top film, I never questioned it's position. I still do not question it's position today, simply because it is most definitely the second greatest film I have ever seen. City Of God is sensational, a masterpiece emanating from the slums of Brazil.The film starts off in a newly built City Of God, a favela in seemingly pretty good nick. The narrator, Rocket, is introduced. Rocket is a Nick Carraway from Great Gatsby sort of person. He does his best to stay honest, even talking to the audience in a way Nick Carraway does. He also tries his best not to be involved in anything, yet finds himself having a weak connection with every character in the film or book. In fact, Rocket's story is so close to that of Li'l Zé (legendary antagonist) that it becomes a plot point how far apart their lifestyles dictate them to be. Never has a film spoken so much to me about so many things. The physical and emotional power of drugs, crime and murder. The gang of Li'l Zé could be a band of misfits, composed of ginger haired cocaine addicts and aggressive 9 nine year olds, but more sinister gangs are we unlikely to come across in real lifeI often seem to have problems with the way death is treated in Western films. I remember the copious amounts of deaths, and it feels so dehumanised that I never fully enjoy western films. Clint Eastwood just shoots bandit after bandit, and never gets anything coming to him. In City Of God, every act, every murder of a person has a family behind it. A family that will seek revenge, and no matter how primary the antagonist or protagonist is, it will not make them any harder to kill. Clint Eastwood has Chuck Norris like abilities of invincibility if any of his Westerns are to be believed. These acts of retribution come as a shock to every character, as it does to the audience. It is so well made and true to life, that one cannot pick out who has what agenda. The film also uses flashbacks to now important dialogue, to enhance the facepalm at your own stupidity effect.Finally, the film making. This is what nails the film as being head and shoulders above the rest. Even Matrix-style bullet time shots are used, but they finish by being melted into a shot of the same character, but 20 years previously. Magic. We also get many scenes shown together in real time from different perspectives, and it never seems to be too much for the human eye. It beats 3D images any day of the year as well.The list can go on, but not without spoilers. If you are OK with themes such as drugs, murder, rape and heartless 8 year old psychopaths, then watch this film as soon as possible! Actually, even earlier if you can."
tysonmorris2008,"Jun 29, 2010",10/10,"Much of my own sentiments have already been echoed by other posted reviews here. As my rating indicates, I consider this one of the finest movies of all time. It's something of a Brazilian ""Goodfellahs."" A coming of age story, a mafia story. An urban ""Lord of the Flies."" There are a myriad of virtues to single out in such an epic triumph such as this, but I'd like to simply draw attention to one of the most gripping pieces of acting I've ever seen in film -- and it's that of the young boy who faces the drawn gun of another young boy. The scene comes in the middle of the movie and it is mesmerizing and horrific. It's a representation of the intensity of the film as a whole.That the events of this story aren't stretches from the reality of the slums of South America is a simultaneous testament to colossal film-making and blemish upon the history of civilization."
lsmassive,"Nov 12, 2006",10/10,"When this movie came out, I saw it 5 times in 7 days in the theater. I was waiting at tower at midnight the night that it came out and I bought two copies (one to lend out and one to keep). The documentary that came with the movie was also great ""News from a personal war"". I can't believe that the director followed this up with ""the constant gardener"", which I thought sucked in comparison. It was a decent movie, but next to City Of God, it failed to even compare. Brutal reality brilliantly shot and acted would probably be the best way to describe this movie. The Soundrack is also incredible. I was never aware of the situation in Brazil with the crime and corruption until viewing this film. This flick was a powerful way to get that message out to the American and international public."
michimimi,"Nov 16, 2022",9/10,"When I first started this movie I was not expecting this. The movie is a roller coaster ride one which might make you afraid for a little bit but you enjoy the ride nonetheless. The characters are well written and cudos to the actors because they did an amazing job. The movie was extraordinally made. From the start to the end it did great and it made a really good job in the themes it had. In the end it shows how life really is. This movie had me go through different emotions. Once again the cast was spectacular, the plot was great and the storyline gave all that it could've. This is a movie I will never forget."
lukem-52760,"Apr 8, 2024",9/10,"I would call CITY OF GOD the best gangster film I've ever seen. Miles ahead, & better, than overrated gang films such as Goodfellas (i found that film ridiculously overrated & boring) better than Casino (again boring & overrated) & City of God is better than Menace To Society & Boys N the Hood, in my opinion.Also this movie is better than any Tarantino crime film, yep beats his Fiction & Dogs.City of God is fantastically & ferociously directed for maximum impact, excitement & power. The cinematography is outstanding-all-time & the music is just awesome, with it's 70's funk flavour.The cast of unknowns was a masterful move & to get powerhouse performances from non professionals was lightning in a bottle greatness.Such memorable characters like ""Knockout Ned"" & Rocket & Lil' Z & Benny & The Tender Three & The Runts, i remember all these & I've only seen it once!!! That's how great the characters were & what an impact the story has on a viewer.Yeah the story is the basic good kid growing up in the tough ghetto & trying to break free, but few have done it this mesmerising before.I can't wait to watch it again!!!The movie is full of very colourful characters that often you can't help but like. Yes there's still some that you hate (Lil, Z) but most are just innocent kids with no way out of their desperate situation & so turn to selling or using drugs. It ain't pretty but the film shows it how it is, with the good times & the bad times like in real life.The City of God is the ghetto slum city & that place is a constant dark entity of a character too.The film discovered a fantastic actress in Alice Braga, she went to be in I AM LEGEND with Will Smith & PREDATORS.A Brazilian Masterworks of a Gang land drama/ thriller. The opening chicken chase is a superb sequence into a movie that is drenched in clever camera work, editing & back stories galore that all create a single full story structure of the city & its people.The movie is extremely gritty, grimy & brutal, but with purpose & a pure cinematic visual style.A coming of age story set in the darkest slum city of Rio."
CelluloidRehab,"Oct 28, 2004",10/10,"My first milestone at IMDb occurs (50th review) with this amazing movie. The plot of City of God revolves around Rocket (an aspiring photographer) as he grows up in the slums of Rio De Janeiro and the events that occur there. The cinematography is simply amazing, from the various ""action shots"", to the way the story is broken up into anachronous mini stories. It is also amazing how intertwined all the stories are. You get an idea of the cinematography from the opening scene where a chicken escapes from a restaurant and a whole gang of people go chasing after it. The scene is comical at first and then turns serious very quickly as the chicken ends up in front of Rocket with a gang of approximately 30 members armed with guns on one side and the police on the other side (Rocket and the chicken caught in the middle). This movie is very intense, but feels realistic. The violence does not seem over the top but indicative of a plausible situation. The movie is also wrought with social critique : from the drugs use, to the crime (murder,theft), to the poverty and the widespread corruption of the slums in Brazil (and the similarity to slums everywhere). There are similarities to other movies including Scarface (1983), Boyz in the Hood and Menace II Society. This movie seems more gritty, more real than those movies. This might be due to the fact that those movies dealt with adults and young adults (16-35 year old), while this movie deals primarily with children. The ending is a mixed bag of optimism and pessimism (good things do happen, but also history does repeat itself). This movie MUST be seen."
Rodan11,"Oct 12, 2004",N/A,"If you live through the TOP 250 List of the IMDb best films ever, there are certain milestones of movie-history which come along uncompared to whatever came thereafter. Godfather's epic design, Shawshank Redemptions brilliant story-developing, Pulp Fictions step into the next millennium of fulfillment for the movie needs of a new generation. Breathtaking adoption of fairy tales like LOTR 1-3, melting Kids and Adults together in Toy Story 1 &2 leaves one back in the seat forever. What should be next? Any new movie design possible to fit in the TOP 250 IMDb List. Impossible I shouted out loud and slept well in my movie chair, until I have seen CITY OF GODS. With no expectations at all, I didn't breathe for the entire movie, no time for POPCORN and the drink. The opening scene sums up MTV Type of Clip-Movies in 3 Minutes and leaves u wishing to read the book, so that you can check for the ending, because you are thrilled into the last peace of your body. But the movie keeps its tension till the end. Cinematography at its best, with really unseen techniques not being incorporated for the selfsuck of the cinematographer, purely for the needs of the storytelling. Not a single actor appeared in TV Sitcom before, not on stage or in the movies before and all are playing there lives better than anybody could do. I could continue to describe why I think, that this movie is expanding the TOP 250 List not only because of the voters, it is really one step ahead in movie development and the best of it: It is not out of the Hollywood-Sundance-Cannes Bowl."
Popey-6,"Jun 13, 2003",6/10,"If you looking for roughly sketched characters then this is your film. Like the film itself the central protagonists survive only on pace and violence. Unexpectedly unbloody, City of God's main saviour is its reliance on flashback and quirky narrative that owes much more to early Hollywood gangster flicks of the Bogart era than the Scorsese style many critics enthuse about. Worth a look - you'll certainly be kept on your toes."
Maciste_Brother,"Jan 25, 2005",1/10,"Though a lot of people and critics have praised this Brazilian movie, I have to say that I did not like it at all. The story is bleak & serious and yet it's filmed like a GAP commercial, with a lot of stylish editing, camera movements (like the annoying 360 degrees one) and direction, which totally belies the story's tragic intent.The film is more of a showcase of the director's repertoire of movie tricks than of actual characters going through a hellish life. In the end, the effect is jarring and at times really off putting. There are a lot of gratuitous moments in it that serve no purpose but to shock or titillate the audience (the housewife and the banana bit, for example).OUR LADY OF THE ASSASSINS was much better than this and created an unforgettable experience without all the flashy razzle dazzle.CITY OF GOD is just another overpraised foreign movie."
AbdullahA-370,"Jul 20, 2025",10/10,"Watching Cidade de Deus was like being thrown into the heart of a world I've never seen, but couldn't look away from. The film's raw energy and fast-paced storytelling pulled me in immediately. It didn't just show violence-it explained how a city and its forgotten people are shaped by it. I followed Rocket, the narrator, who just wanted to escape the cycle, and yet he lived in a place where kids held guns before they learned to read. The cinematography was stunning, contrasting beauty with brutality in every scene. It felt real, overwhelming, heartbreaking. Cidade de Deus left me speechless-it's not just a film, it's a wake-up call."
kylemorrell,"Oct 12, 2020",10/10,"I would say City of God is one of the better films I've watched in recent years.The film follows two kids from the favelas of Rio de Janeiro growing up in two completely different paths, one is a blooming photographer and the other is a sociopathic crime lord, leading the drug traffic that's gone rampant in Rio's poorest neighborhoods. The films characters come to life with the contrasting emotions the two characters have, one is completely shocked by the amount of crime and corruption going on and the other has a joyous smile on his face as his thirst for blood, money, and power grows over the course of the film.The film can be unsettling and uncomfortable at times with the amount of gore and lack of human decency that the characters in the film have as a result of the systemic oppression and corruption that was and still is prevalent in Brazil that will have you on the edge of your seat.The film can have a fast pace at times that almost makes it hard to follow what's going on, but following the narration and overall subject of the character dialogue helps understand the films overarching story. The cinematography and sound design really engages the audience, especially during some of the night club scenes that use more recognizable music for international audiences as well as the usage of more traditionally-styled Brazilian music also ties in the setting of the film very well.I highly recommend anyone interested in this film to experience it firsthand to get the best sense of judgement, but overall this films mix of fantastic visuals and cinematography with its fast pacing sound design creates an engaging viewing experience for an otherwise depressing subject matter."
rickashton-41049,"Jan 11, 2024",9/10,"This movie captures both a coming of age story with a dramatic story of crime and journalism.The acting is incredible all around and you really feel like you're living in the city.The scene at the club with the music is one of my favorite scenes of all time and there are so many surprises in this movie.Additionally, I love the direction with the use of camera movement and wide establishing shots.I wish more movies had this blend of professionalism, humor, and tention.I do think that the movie could have been a little shorter, but overall that is a small criticism for a movie that is truly a masterpiece."
TheMovieDiorama,"Feb 28, 2018",9/10,"Set in the infamous slum known simply as ""City of God"", a young man's ambition to become a photographer leads him to the dangerous world of urban warfare. There is so much to take in that one viewing just wouldn't create a clear reflection of the film. It plays out like a typical gangster narrative, two opposing rivalries attempt to own businesses and so bullets rain down upon the streets of Rio. What differentiates this from, let's say Goodfellas, is the sheer brutality and realistic imagery that is conveyed. Murder, rape, drugs...it's all here. But the residents raised in the City of God know no different, it's their way of life. A turf war might happen to one generation, only for the next generation to look up to them and aspire the same desire for power and authority. And so the cycle repeats. It's uncontrollable. The theme of vengeance is prominent as well. How being consumed by revenge can not just lose yourself, but the innocent lives around you. Those who segregate themselves from the violence of gang culture. It's a bold statement but an important one to tell. The favelas and slums of Rio and how the government manage the overgrowing population is what contributes to this lifestyle these people are forced into. Jobs are scarce, the standard of living is low...what else can they resort to? It's a harsh reality, but a reality nonetheless. Plenty of memorable characters, especially their nicknames, that make them human. The natural performances and raw emotion that is portrayed clearly indicates to us that there is a sense of innocence to these gang members. With many of them wanting to remove themselves from the gang culture. Meirelles' direction was frantic and fast paced with a hint of grittiness. That's my only criticism, it's too rapid. Need time to let the raw emotional impact simmer and affect you. I adored the narrative though, embedding character origins within the main plot was refreshing. City of God is one of those rare films that depicts the harsh reality of gang culture."
hdotross,"Nov 11, 2022",9/10,"Still one of my all time favorites. Think this movie was the first movie I ever watched all the way through that had subtitles lol. I loved everything about this movie; the story, the characters, the cast, the location and the cinematography. I remember putting the movie in the dvd player thinking it would make good background noise as I attempted to go to sleep while on a road trip. Before I knew it the movie was over and I was still wanting more. Think I had to watch it like 4 more times that month lol. Actually talking about it now makes me want to go watch. If you haven't seen this film I strongly suggest it."
claudiano,"Oct 1, 2002",10/10,"One of the best movies EVER, in my opinion.Some people think it is a little bit violent, but that is because they didn´t truly understand the idea and the story behind the scenes.DO NOT MISS IT!"
thomasjay-2201,"Jul 29, 2018",N/A,Such a hyper stylised film might be a turn off for some but personally the breakneck pace of the film is amazing in telling such a detailed story and also keeping things light hearted in what's quite frankly a bleak existence for our protagonist 'Rocket'. An extremely enjoyable film the twist of sorts at the end is very pleasant
AleksandrBelenko,"Jan 11, 2019",7/10,"Let me start from afar. If you actively use the database and read users' reviews you might be a little bit confused about pretty much everything.
The worst movie presented on the site can have a lot of 10/10s and praising comments. As well as the best movie, currently ""Shawshank Redemption"" can have many 1/10s saying that it does not deserve to be the best movie, or even saying that it is actually one of the worst movies ever.
I understand that for each person each movie feels subjective and one person will like something that the other person will not.
But in such case as this people that think that movie is ok or even good would give the lowest grade to drop the number of the movie on the list of 250 bests.
I currently is on the marathon of IMDB's best movies, and ""City of God"" is in top 20, so I couldn't miss it. And before watching I couldn't resist temptation of reading some reviews. Oh man, so many people hate this movie. Yet it is here in the top list. That actually made it more interesting to me. Why is so?
And here is my opinion: the movie is not bad. If you don't pay attention from the start you might dislike the movie. Otherwise it is nice criminal story with no romantizing of bandit life. Do I think it deserves to be in top of all time? Probably not. But that is solely my opinion.
In conclusion, it is decent gangster movie about simple kids. And that is all. No more no less. Not a masterpiece, yet not a piece of you know what. Just watch it and make up your own opinion, as did I."
aprilzh,"Jan 5, 2020",10/10,"City of God tells the semi-autobiographical story of one young man's experiences growing up alongside the gangs of one of Brazil's most natorious slums in the 1970's. It's stylish. It's groovy and hip. Those things in and of themselves don't make a great movie. But here they serve the story in a remarkable way. The music of the decade and the documentary-like camerawork and slick editing all enhance the experience. The way in which the lead character's everyday struggles are expertly and fluidly intertwined with the rise and fall of the neighborhood gangs is astounding as he brushes shoulders with various characters on both sides of the law. And the narration, which I don't normally enjoy in films, is some of the best I've come across. Very well done."
CurtRix1,"Aug 30, 2025",10/10,"City of God (2002) - Gritty, real, and unflinching. It throws you straight into the chaos of drugs, gangs, and survival, yet still finds room for moments of tenderness and hope. Despite the brutal subject matter, it's impossible not to be drawn into that world - raw, challenging, and unforgettable..."
ejderkelebek,"Apr 3, 2007",10/10,"What one expects in a film can differ. But the film itself suits the audience. This film did very well to me. Perfect cinematography, perfect story telling, perfect story, that which is very important for the world, gangs and the children soldiers. Sociology, philosophy, truth. This film has all of those. Takes us to pace where we cannot enter. And enters in them tells the stories. Not only one but many stories of many people. This film explains all. That is perfect director, perfect film and I am just amazed. It really pays its #17 in top 250 of IMDb list. Stunning. Also proves the IMDb writers and readers sense of rating. If you did not watch it you have to hurry."
antaleixo_filmmaker,"Feb 14, 2023",10/10,"An absolute master piece. Fernando Meirelles nailed it.Has to be the best gangster film I have ever seen. It's one of those rare pieces of art which are extremely stylistic but at the same time very raw & grounded. The piece by piece narrative just hooks the nail of the audience's focus. Extremely honest portrayal of one of the worst crime led places in the world, this has to be one of the best creation of world cinema. No wonder why it gets so much praises. Lots of provoking thought, tension and emotion, while the action is positively explosive, frighteningly brutal and designed with a real meticulousness."
jack_o_hasanov,"Aug 27, 2021",9/10,"Watching the movie was difficult. Rio is indeed a dangerous city. I've seen the name of this movie a lot in the ""best movies"" lists. In fact, I recommend this movie. Watch."
ketkarparth,"Aug 26, 2021",9/10,"One of the best foreign dramas I have ever seen. The film just keeps on esclatating till the very end. The actors are raw and rugged, some of the sequences just make you flinch. Hats off to the creators, they surely have the guts to bring such a subject in front of the audience which was still in love with censored love stories for a long time. Great job!"
noralee,"Mar 16, 2003",N/A,"""City of God (Cidade de Deus)"" may be the most violent movie I've ever seen.And just when I thought I was inured to the shooting and the murders, such that I couldn't even keep track of them anymore or who was getting killed by whom for what reason or carelessness, it topped itself and got more violent and made me start caring again.It's not just the socially conscious Brazilian true story line of abject poverty creating an army of desperate children with guns that makes this so captivating and meaningful beyond the endless bloodshed.Directors Kátia Lund and Fernando Meirelles have a relentless, in-your-face camera style that circles around somewhat similarly to ""Amos Perros."" The story, based on a novel based on true facts, if I could figure out the non-translated credits correctly, whips around in time to show us how each mini-gangster in the huge, differentiated ensemble of extraordinary amateur actors got to be the way he is.The voice-over narrator, and what happens to him as a budding photo-journalist, is a bit precious and is virtually the only bordering on cliche element, but he is a convenient window into a world of children who literally cannot separate fantasy from reality, (who have no access to violent TV, movies, or video games as a scapegoat) and have no impulse control whatsoever.The pulsating samba, funk, and Brazilian R & B music helps push the pace even faster; the action mostly takes place in the '60's and '70's so there's no hip hop though it's like illustrations of gangsta rap's most extreme tendencies.Props to the distributor for black outlining the white subtitles, as much of the visuals are a bleached-out landscape of hopelessness."
mtsai-2,"Feb 2, 2003",1/10,"Imagine what it would have been like if Tarantino made a film about the D.C. area sniper shootings, then you'll get ""City of God"" - a sensational, cold and calculated stylistic exercise based on compelling real-life human drama. The story of the kids involving in the drug trade turf wars is an extraordinary one, but somehow the filmmaker has managed to reduce it to a showcase of his cinematic bag of tricks. This film has left me completely cold, and disgusted by the filmmaker's intentions."
scarfaceyahya,"Oct 19, 2024",10/10,"*City of God* (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and co-directed by Kátia Lund, is a raw and visceral portrayal of life in the slums of Rio de Janeiro. The film, based on real events, offers a gripping, unflinching look at crime, poverty, and survival in one of Brazil's most notorious favelas.The story spans several decades, following the lives of two boys, Rocket and Li'l Zé, as they take very different paths in the favela. Rocket dreams of becoming a photographer, while Li'l Zé rises through the ranks of crime, becoming a ruthless drug lord. The film is known for its gritty realism, fast-paced editing, and documentary-style cinematography, which immerses viewers in the chaotic and often violent world of the slums.What makes *City of God* stand out is its ability to humanize its characters while depicting the harsh realities they face. The performances, especially by the young, largely non-professional cast, are deeply affecting. The film masterfully balances moments of brutal violence with quieter, more introspective scenes, offering both a thrilling crime drama and a social commentary on inequality and desperation.Overall, *City of God* is a visually stunning, emotionally charged masterpiece that leaves a lasting impression. It's not just a crime film-it's a poignant exploration of the impact of environment and circumstance on human lives."
ramsri81,"Mar 31, 2005",10/10,"Seriouslly this movie is one of the best gangster movies ever made.The way the story is being told,the characters involved in the story,acting of the actors are just brilliant.The story of drugs and people of worlds most notorious slum in Brazil was brilliantly shot and recreated.People who think staying in Brazil was all about paradise, really need to see this one to see how things were around the 60's and 70's.Definitely a collector's item.I have no possible glitches in the whole film to give it less than 10( a little bit of violence,but if its a real incident it shouldn't be cut!!!!!!!).It said on the DVD cover that THE GOODFELLAS of BRAZIL, I would say they really meant it."
Cineman187,"Feb 19, 2005",10/10,"Fernando Meirelles has orchestrated a fascinating piece of movie making to establish not only himself as a fine director, but also to establish a film that surely deserves its place among the best of its kind. The story and characters seem to revel in the distinct Brazilian surroundings and every character relishes their roles; Leandro Firmino flourishes as Li'l Zé, as he shows a menacing and devilish streak to his psychotic character. Alexandre Rodrigues (Rocket) tells the story how it is and before we know it the sun is scorching down on us while gunfights of gang warfare smother the streets in broad daylight. Violence is present only when necessary, and when it surfaces it is quite extreme. Don't let this deter you from viewing this flawless film - even if you happen to feel uncomfortable at the sight of blood - because the film has quality in abundance; the camera work vividly captures the intensity of the script, and the raw dialect of Portuguese adds an extra punch (if you speak the language). The story revolves around a young man whom dreams of becoming a photographer. His struggle to contend with everyday violence - which seems to be a recurring theme throughout the film - sets up a tense and intriguing atmosphere. We are brought to the streets so we have an idea of how the drug situation works and what it takes for gangs to protect their business. With a beautiful view of a landscape,sadly bearing the vast and derelict Favalas, we are intentionally made to explore just how poverty stricken these people are. This film defines just about every emotion possible and with fluid skill. I don't need to recommend this film as you have probably seen it advertised everywhere, but I will say don't avoid it because you would certainly be missing out."
sausagefactory2010,"May 30, 2007",10/10,"Many people say this is a fantastic film for its striking visual achievements, however I personally feel that they alone would never carry a film, especially a film as epic and grand as this. Of course, every time you see Lil' Ze's rampages or Rocket caught in the middle of the shootout in the streets (literally) it startles you with its sense of grandeur and bravado, but really the achievement is carrying such a brilliant story, where the hero does not actually do much but look on and try to survive. Fernando Meirelles pushes the boat out and, in fact, you get surprised in your own personal emotional involvement with the story. Just for example, the scene where a young boy has to choose between being shot in the hand or the foot is particularly poignant.I certainly would recommend it any discerning film lover or, in fact, anybody looking for an emotional roller-coaster. Take a deep breath and put the DVD on, enjoy."
paul2001sw-1,"Jan 3, 2007",9/10,"Fernando Meirelles portrait of gang life, 'City of God', has been likened to Martin Scorcese's 'Goodfellas', but it's far more visceral, and less stylised, than that film, and underpinned by a portrait of the appalling poverty of the Brazillian slums. Fast-paced, superbly acted, uncompromising and without a whiff of glamour, it's a movie that re-invents the tired old gangster genre by actually telling it as it is, and not as the clichés tell us to expect, and a serious piece of social and political history on the side. This is a very fine film, one in which shreds of tattered humanity gleam through the cracks of the doors of hell."
gratatatata,"May 4, 2021",9/10,"City of God is a movie you get combining elements from movies such as ""Goodfellas"" and then adding a whole new element to camera usage and character development. Amazing performances by every one, especially by Leandro Firmino who portrays the main villian in this film. Great feel to this movie and great emotions are captured! Would also like to add that the soundtrack is great. An amazing movie, and a must-watch in my opinion!"
toxiccity,"Feb 19, 2005",9/10,"Although it is based on a true story a lot of the elements are truthful. This amazing film gives you an insight into the slums of Rio De Jineiro. This was my first movie I have seen with subtitles all the way through, however after 5 minutes I forgot about it as I was lost in the power of the movie. Although the film is graphic in many ways the movie has a comical side to it that adds another dimension to the picture. The film has an excellent storyline with great acting and intense power. This is a must see for anybody but if you like powerful films such as Godfather and Fight Club this is just your sort of film. It is just another example of the fact you can make an astonishing film with a low budget and unproven actors."
mehmetbozgedik,"Jan 29, 2021",9/10,This was like the director was telling me that 'Just sit back and enjoy the ride'. Please do not watch this piece when you are feeling down and in the mood for something more dull and slow paced.
JPL-916,"Mar 15, 2004",N/A,"For those who haven't seen it, It's a story of a freelance photographer who appears to get caught in a street gang clash by accident. But it's no accident. He traces the whole history of the gangs and how he grew up and how the gang members grew into their stature.I knew it wouldn't get best picture but I'm surprised by the huge nominations it got. Fernando Meirelles did a very good job into turning non-actors into actors. It makes the story that much real. Plus that's what I admired about the story, the fact that it's so real. So brutally truthful. It's of something that you can see happening even from you own home-city, if you live in a city known for gang-violence. It's a gang story that would put ""Boyz 'N The Hood"" to shame.For those who haven't seen it, see it. Even though it has subtitles, it's worth seeing."
chera_khalid,"Feb 28, 2025",7/10,"City of God is a visually stunning and emotionally gripping film that immerses the viewer in the harsh reality of Rio de Janeiro's favelas. With its masterful storytelling, raw performances, and kinetic cinematography, the film delivers a powerful narrative about crime, survival, and fate.Director Fernando Meirelles crafts a compelling, non-linear story that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The characters feel real, their struggles are heartbreaking, and the violence, while brutal, never feels excessive-it serves the story and enhances the film's authenticity. The use of real-life locations and a mostly non-professional cast adds to the film's documentary-like realism.While the film excels in its intensity and realism, it can feel overwhelming at times due to its relentless pace and the sheer number of characters introduced. However, these minor issues don't take away from its impact. City of God is more than just a crime film; it's a harrowing yet beautifully crafted exploration of a world where violence is a cycle that few can escape.A must-watch for fans of gritty, thought-provoking cinema. 8/10."
Der_Schnibbler,"Jul 10, 2009",5/10,"The movie is basically the story of a bunch of criminal trash who grow up robbing and murdering in a makeshift ghetto for the homeless (in which the government has tossed them) at the outskirts of Rio de Janeiro. Predictably, they grow up to become only more sociopathic and parasitical on society. Some might call them ""gangsters,"" but really people like these are merely low class, low IQ garbage that deserve death.The one good thing about this movie is the beginning. For once, you see dangerous sociopathic scum get what they deserve from the cops. One of them gets shot down in the street running like a dog while his psychopathic girlfriend ""cries.""The rest of the film develops in predictable ways: the glory days and the requisite downfall. You can kind of think of this movie as the ""Good Fellas"" version for the kind of subhuman garbage they must deal with in Brazil. Decent piece of entertainment, if you're not too revolted by their sociopathic criminality, not to mention their ugly faces."

One2Three4Five,"Mar 7, 2019",10/10,"I usually don't read reviews with a 10/10 so I didn't want to put a 10/10, but honestly I can't find anything wrong with this film. The story is well written, the locations look authentic, the acting is brilliant, and the cinematography and mise-en-scene portrays the emotions of the scenes well.This film is a good example of a good use of narration, it is used sparingly and does not tell us everything we should be able to work out from the film itself. What I mean by this is that the narration doesn't tell us what is happening in the scene, or what different character's opinions are. Instead the narration is used to tell us who this next part is about, it reminds us that the film is taking place in the memories or Rocket (the main character/narrator) and that eventually we will return to the scene which the movie opened in, all while not distracting us from the story.I mentioned the color pallet of this film in my title. The color pallet is something which usually goes overlooked in films, but in this it plays an important part. The main character is an aspiring photographer and having a good use of color is important in photography so it is important the shots should look photogenic so the main character is constantly being inspired to be a photographer."
khushcg,"Dec 5, 2021",10/10,"What a masterpiece! Every style of every film department fulfilled what can uplift the audience to their desired vision. The film is mischievous in the gangster genre. It tells a true story in such a dramatic format that you like to watch what is concluded in the film. I also now understand why it has such a cult status; it deserves it.'City of God' is a movie about gang criminal elements. Let it be guns, riots, drugs, illegal trading, theft, extortion; The children in the neighborhood roam around with loaded guns, adults killing minors, minors killing adults, sexual assaults. 'City of god' is filled with notorious antagonists who murdered for fun. This story will devastate you on how much brutality is there in this world. But also suggest hope of how a Good-hearted child who liked photography but lived in the city of god could complete his wish. The story depicts the antagonist, his entry into crime, his family and friends, and his childhood through the protagonist's eyes. So many characters developed and performed craftily.Direction And Camera Crew :
City of god grounds you to the streets of Rio at the time where guns were in everyone's hand in such an atmosphere of violence and innocence. This is only because of the direction and collaboration of every single actor. With every breath of the protagonist, you feel what's he'll narrate to you, and this credit goes to the cinematic choice to make it in shaggy camera work, amateur style, dumbling and shaking every shot.Screenplay and implementation:
The ability to present a true story in brilliant writing, exploring every character with so much detailing to their personality and belongings, is one of a kind. You see the antagonist's anger, envy, and jealousy; you see the protagonist's innocence, love, and maturity, so deep-rooted in them."
vishal_khanna,"Feb 17, 2005",9/10,"Cidade De Deus is an excellent 'Docudrama' on the lives of the victimised and self victimising street children in the City of God  Rio De Janeiro.The screenplay is unique, despite the rapid shifts between the past and the present, and the stories of so many characters told together; it does not leave you confused to stop and think. Everything falls into place so well, that you can immediately catch up with the 'exceedingly fast pace' of the film.The script doesn't spend much time establishing facts or characters, although it gives glimpses of each character's life to establish them. Yet, the entire procedure is not at all contrived. It simply flows. But, the pace of the movie is a little fast keeping in mind even today's cinema. ""Cidade de Deus is probably five years ahead of its time"".The performances are so naturalistic that nobody is 'acting', despite the profound intensity of so many exacting scenes. Small children have acted so realistically, it makes you believe that you are actually watching a documentary shot on the streets. One scene I wish to highlight is the scene in which Ze shoots a small boy in his foot and the way the boy cries. That was EXCELLENT! Director Fernando Meirelles simply proclaims to the universe his directorial prowess.The drug use and the shootings' scenes are very realistically executed. The sound department has done a commendable job to embellish the visuals.The cinematography is exquisitely executed giving a feel of a European location with regards to the light and density of colours. Most of the day scenes have been shot during the Golden Hours to avoid the harshness of midday sunlight. They have very intelligently tried to avoid exposing shadows on the ground wherever possible.But, some shots are taken with so many camera jerks (for cinematic effect), that it tends to irritate the eye at a point. This is something I want to emphatically mention: Cinematography is the showcase of a film. Bad costumes, bad locations, bad acting can often be cleverly manipulated by using good angles and dramatic lighting. But, such jerky camera work actually creates even more disturbing visuals in an already disturbing subject/movie. It does add to the effect, but it also gets confusing at times; more so, irritating. I do not advocate the use of traditional film making with fixed camera angles and trolley movements, but there has to be some consideration for the viewer, for whom the movie is being made.All in all, it is almost a modern day classic. The Director, Actors, DP, Sound Department, Editor, all deserve a standing ovation, but it is the Script that Rules!"
mik-blo,"May 16, 2015",N/A,"The story begins with the early stages of the City of God (in the 1960's) showing where many of the problems stem from- the extreme poverty, overcrowding etc. Here, in the early stages of the favela, we meet our main characters, along with the supporting cast. The story revolves mainly around two characters living in the favela, Rocket and Lil Ze, and how they take two different paths through life. Rocket's dream is to become a photographer and to escape the City of God while Lil Ze becomes a powerful gang leader and drug dealer.The film offers an unflinching look at gang life in the City of God, as it follows the favela through three decades; the 60's, 70's and 80's, and shows how violence just spirals into more violence with the disturbingly high amounts of violence in the favela, most involving teenagers and children.The direction, cinematography, and editing are all Oscar-worthy. The cinematography is some of the best I have ever seen- with a very visceral, jerky feel, very reminiscent of Saving Private Ryan. The editing is very frantic, which makes you feel like you are on the streets of the City of God, and the direction is flawless, seamlessly blending the many elements of the story.The film was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story, the direction, the cinematography, the editing and the acting all add up to make a excellent movie that I would recommend to all."
Vartiainen,"Oct 11, 2014",7/10,"Based on a novel by Paulo Lins who based the plot on real events having taken place in a favela, Brazilian slum, called City of God. The story is one of lost, unforgiving odds, bleak chances, little to no chance of escaping and of friends turned enemies.City of God is a unique experience and a unique film. Only a couple of the actors had had any prior acting experience, all of them in relatively minor roles. All of the rest, including all the main actors, were picked from actual favelas, many of them from the actual City of God. And yet, if I hadn't been told this, I couldn't have told. They're that good, that deep into their characters, and they bring this manic energy into everything they do on screen. You can sense the raw emotions churning under their skin, because they've been there. They know what it's like.The film doesn't pull any punches either. It tells the story about young street punks, looking their slice of heaven and riches through robbery, drug dealing, racketing, murder and mayhem. It doesn't shy away from the harsh realities, it doesn't try to sugarcoat it, nor does it offer any excuses.Aside from the unprofessional actors, the rest of the film is very professional. The cinematography is brilliant, as is the whole style, the whole vibrant yet muddy feel they give to the City. The story spans about a decade of time, yet it feels cohesive, like we never lose anything because of a jump in time.City of God is unforgiving. It's brutal, bloody, unpleasant and showcases that we still have a long way to go as a species. But we need films like it exactly for that last part. We need to be shown what's still wrong with the world. And I admire this film for having to guts to do just that."
Jim West,"Feb 14, 2004",1/10,"In spite of so much undeserved acclaim from some critics, this is a terrible movie, cheap in all respects as far as the cinematic art is concerned. Many people may approve it merely on account of its demagogic handling of a 'relevant issue' such as extreme poverty and criminality in the slums area of underdeveloped countries. But regardless of its dynamic editing that attempts to pass for 'modern' or 'innovative', this is an extremely bad movie, poorly written, directed and enacted.  I'll never understand why the AMPAS absurdly decided to nominate this nauseating movie for several awards. But don't fall for this imposture: trust me, this picture is not worth the price of your admission ticket.  Stay away from it!"

adeilsoncs,"Jan 22, 2021",9/10,Excellent title that shows the Brazilian reality through the favelas of Rio de Janeiro. The film tries to faithfully and transparently reproduce organized crime within the favelas.
luoqimapes,"May 27, 2020",9/10,"After watching the movie, I felt like crying for a minute. I have to say that a lot of the art was well handled and I could feel the director's thoughts and feelings."
vanessapeinado-01555,"Oct 13, 2020",9/10,"The use of sound in this movie is very different from the typical movies being released at this time. I would say overall this movie is very different, I think it is more real than what I've seen lately. When I say real I mean there is not a lot of advanced effects or serious CGI going on. There was the use of the split-screen and some other minor effects but nothing too grand to make the movie seem like a made-up story. The limit of these effects makes the movie real to me, almost as if the audience is right there with them. I also think the sound helps bring the realness to life because the background noises of washing dishes or the gravel on the ground are loud enough to be noticed. They are at the volume they would be as if you were right there, or pretty close to it. I think that the ambient sounds are the most used sound effect and it helps give a perspective of the location and even time period. I would say that the diegetic music also helps illuminate the time period with the party music they listen to and the overlapping of the voices adds to this raw, realness vibe I keep mentioning. The narration helps the timeline flow and easier to follow. It takes us along and gives us what we need to know to put the pieces together and understand the characters. Overall, I like this film because it gives an insight into what it was like to live in the slums and the film was portrayed very well."
PeterF7,"Oct 1, 2025",10/10,"This film will always remain iconic to me because it stands apart in its genre with an execution that feels truly unique and unmatched. I haven't come across another film in the same category that conveys its themes, emotions, and artistic vision in such a powerful and unforgettable way, ever indeed."
WriterDave,"Jun 24, 2004",8/10,"""City of God"" is clearly one of the most aesthetically complex and viscerally charged motion pictures ever made. There are many scenes here for students of film to take great joy in simply in terms of aesthetics. The cinematography, editing, and pacing is inventive, mind-blowing and lovingly inspired by the best work of Scorsese. I could go on and on about the opening ""chicken run"" sequence, ""Shaggy's"" death scene, the disco shoot-out, or any number of other ""WOW"" scenes of pure cinematic adrenaline.It's this kind of movie magic that breathes life into the myth of the ""greatest film of all time.""But be warned, as much as this film can be ""enjoyed"", it is clearly far from the myth it jolts to life with its ""look, mom, no hands"" style of film-making. It's also highly disturbing, more so than anything Scorsese has done. One sequence involving a child who couldn't be older than ten having to shoot another child who looks to be half his age as some sort of gang initiation is so slickly done I felt like I was watching a snuff film. Based on a true story about Brazilian slum dwellers and the crime waves overtaking the town, ""City of God"" is an extremely hard pill to swallow as it wallows in violence, offers up a hearty dose of moral ambiguity, an almost pornographic take on the criminals it depicts, and leaves the viewer with no real solution or any sign of hope that this cycle can ever conceivably come to an end. The film seems to be saying that the only way to over-come such poverty and crime is to document it (witness our supposed hero who becomes a photographer). With its ultra-slick and highly addictive presentation, the film dupes unsuspecting viewers into witnessing all the depravity as well."
arlened324,"Feb 14, 2004",7/10,"Great reviews.  Disappointed by the relentless violence.  Had no idea this was based on a true story because of the excess.  As seems to be the case in 2004, graphic violence is supposed to make and help us feel the impossible situation of the poor slum kids.  It doesn't.  Damn it.  Is there anyone who remembers that the story of one, only one, victimized character is more powerful than watching millions of people slaughtered.It was like watching 2,000 St. Valentines Day massacres in 2 hours. Horrific but not touching.  We need to care.  This film had too many stories.  Tried to link Vietnam with corporate greed and the eternal reach for money and power.This could have been a brilliant film.  Instead it was a two martini film (you had to wind down) but one which left even the photographer survivor, suspect."
obrienh-00674,"Oct 13, 2021",4/10,The fact that this film has such great reviews makes me like it even less. The script is just poor. The dialogue is awful and I found myself getting more and more bored as it went on. There is no emotion whatsoever. Characters get the bare minimum of development before meeting a brutal end. And the writers repeat this throughout the film. There is simply nothing about this film that I could latch on to in order to keep me engaged. If you're expecting a masterpiece as the 8.6 rating suggests then you're going to be underwhelmed.
jp101010,"Oct 17, 2018",10/10,"Fernando Meirelles & Kátia Lund's film City of God is a truly fascinating film that deeply & poignantly displays the cycle of poverty & crime in the impoverished slums near Rio de Janeiro from the 60's to 80's. Displaying large volumes of emotional turmoil, this film speaks to the entrapment of people in a repetitive cycle of violence and despair by showing us the brutality and violence of what they experience on a daily basis. Primarily through the storytelling of the lead character Rocket we are invited to witness how the shameless drug lords running his city, along with the help of a corrupt police department that sustains the turning of the cycle, destroys the lives of many innocent people. 
 After watching, it felt as though one cannot help but feel their helplessness. And as for the frequent and disturbing acts of violence perpetuated by male dominance in this film, they are perhaps too much to watch more than once. In terms of the film's perspective lens its structure of an interconnected narrative shared between many different characters really allows the viewer to see all the differing aspects of the burden that poverty & crime inflicts on people. They all experience it in some way or another, and it positions us to confront the ugly side of human nature by forcing us to empathize with loss in profoundly penetrating ways. Overall, this film is incredibly compelling and could be described as achieving a great deal of realism especially in terms of its ending. I recommend watching this film."
josepaulo-72710,"Jun 8, 2021",10/10,"Cidade de Deus is a movie that tells us the story of a city, the city of god. It show us the life of the habitants of this city and the struggled life that they have. Robbery, murder, crime after crime this is how you survive in the city of God.Altought this movie doesn´t really have a main character, all characters have an outsanding development and depth. Buscapé, Zé Pequeno, Béne, Mane Galinha, Cabeleira are all amazingly executed and acted.This movie really has everything. It has a personal touch like non other story telling movies that i've seen. The cinematography, the dialogues, the acting, the soundtrack , everything was just on point. Fernando Meirelles really is an amazing director, and he makes that clear with this movie.I cried, i laughed and i felt things that i don´t know how to put into words. This movie was released 19 years ago and yet it feels so dated and present in today's world.Trully a masterpiece, it catched my attention instantly as it started and pictured really well the reality of the City of God- ''a location that does not appear in Rio de Janeiro's post cards''.10/10 - ''An amazing movie about the City of God.''"
hazpafis,"Jun 13, 2004",10/10,"What an amazing movie! Everything just seems to fall into place, the directing, the story, the editing, the cinematography. At first, I was a bit peeved at all the shots but realized it was a movie of parallelism. All those dark shots reflected what life was in Brazil for these boys, how dark it is for them, like there was no way out and that other people did not see them or refused to make an effort to see them and their situation.Fernando Meirelles is a genius. The way he directed all those shots, it tells me to view reality as it is, and not as it should be. It's so good, I just want to cry. Everyone should see it and be moved to action. What an amazing movie!"
almostmorning,"Mar 22, 2005",10/10,"a movie you could show to the ""I don't want to read when I watch a movie get r done"" types and they would thank you at the end. when it ends you feel as if you just stepped off some great roller coaster ride, your bloods flowing and you just start brain storming who should I tell first about this!!! What can I say about this movie... I love I bought two days after I watched it and went on a spree of making my friends watch it with me. I normally don't go on about a movie like this, so I hope you understand how important this movie is to my home collection when ever I try to choose a movie to watch at night I have to tell myself no just so I don't over play it. It's like food for a fat kid it just sits their staring at you, saying, ""pick me you know you love it."""
alperensenay,"Mar 22, 2022",10/10,"""Cidade de Deus"" is a different kind of movie in almost every aspect than Hollywood movies. Firstly I want to specify that this was the first movie which I've watched out of Hollywood, it shocked me unexpectedly. As a difference, there are pure good and evil character, on the contrary Hollywood, Although one of them(Lil'Ze) trys to be agreeable and easy-going person, he doesn't achieve it. However, Rocket achieve to be a criminal or a guilty like Lil'Ze. The two main character can not change themself even if they want to. In the movie, Every character behave their nature that they've had since their childhood. Another difference is that there are some scenes that Hollywood doesn't dare to make with full of reality. For instance, the scene between Lil'Ze and robber kids. This scene astonished me deeply, while I was watching I thought probably they would cut the scene short but they didn't. I felt the horror as the kid did. The scene was exterminity for even me.Messages that was given by the movie is not spoken compared to its story and its cinematography. Necessity of this kind of life in a place like ""City of God"" or favelas is told even in the first scene. Emnity and rage of pushing out of center of Rio de Jenerio is felt every scene in ""City of God"". And in last scene of the movie, director says, nothing will ever change in these streets. Lives will go on how they do at the present. This is upset all of us but what are we doing to contribute to change it? This movie makes me think this idea. Anyway. This movie is one of the best movie I have ever seen in my whole life. I recommend it."
clerkmallrat,"May 27, 2007",10/10,"With pseudo elements of The Godfather, this motion picture is one of those movies that will hold on to you from beginning to end. In this tale of poverty, corruption, and death in the seedy underworld of one of the most beautiful countries on earth: Brazil. This tale is of a young man by the name of Rocket, and as the narrator he is reluctant to tell you every bit of this story. Tracing from his days as a young boy in the sixties to his days as a freelance photographer in the disco era of the 1970's all in the City Of God. But do not let the name fool you because in the City Of God you only find devils and demons. The story follows the tales of the most notorious gangsters, hoodlums, and family all somehow linked to each other. Any fans of the Drama Genre would enjoy this cinematic masterpiece."

thornswrath,"Nov 9, 2004",N/A,"Few films I have ever seen have managed to capture the essence of society's oft-lamented yet never-resolved problems of illegal drug trafficking and the rampant street crime as depicted in the City Of God in Brazil, as shown to us through the remarkably unskewed viewpoint of its many colorful real-life street characters. Of course the street-urchins recruited to play the roles of certain individuals now scattered in time have become first-time actors as a result of this astounding motion picture, and the characters they portray are brought to vivid, realistic life on the big screen in a manner that will captivate audiences from beginning to end, despite its rather long running time. (__-?) The process of sitting through this depiction of inner-slum street gangs and how one generation picks up the business of the older one that leaves it behind for them, is nothing short of revelatory. I thoroughly enjoyed Scorcese's Gangs Of New York, but I will say this: City Of God makes GONY look out to be but child's play. For one thing, Fernando Meirelles utilizes a nonfiction canvas with which to illustrate certain points that Scorcese utilized fictional conventions to get across. In Scorcese's depiction of violence, we are nearly saturated with violence almost for the sake of violence, a sort of hyped-up ultra violence that drives these kinds of gangster-pics, and which might very well repel a certain demographic of viewers who just don't care for that sort of aesthetic. In Meirelles stark and up-close depiction of the real-life dangerous goings-on of certain groups of street gangs, the violence carries with it the reflection of truth, and despite even being possibly more extreme, it can be accepted more as a fact of life or somehow manages to become easier to digest, if not flinch away from. CoG makes GoNY look like child's play, and that's ironic seeing as how it is children which take up the mantle and carry on the business which the older generation leaves for them. I walked out of City Of God a changed man - a refreshed man, that is, because it reminds you just how stark and real this whole business of the natural order of things is. And conversely, just how real the whole nature of the order of business is. Sit down behind the camera lens and allow yourself to be transformed as our young true hero guides you through this City Of God and shows you just how comfortably you sit there in the theatre contemplating it. Do not miss this transcendental film. Open your eyes and see through the lens of a child. Watch how this child grows up and passes through the necessary rituals to become a man. Ask yourself what it is this man has shown you through his eyes. And do not close your eyes to what is going on around you ever again."

SimpletonX,"Mar 19, 2007",10/10,"There's really nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this movie. It is nothing short of amazing. The story draws the viewer in almost immediately, and the beautiful imagery and style of the film is constantly sweeping you from one emotion to the next. The story is so amazingly compelling, that it's impossible to look away. I love foreign films, but even those who don't would love this movie. It is one of my favorites outside any genre. There is no way that anyone wouldn't be effected by this movie, it is an example of film at its very best, rife with satire, social commentary, as well as humor it is a movie that none should miss."
tackledspoon,"Feb 25, 2005",10/10,"After watching this movie, not only was I stunned at the events that took place, but struck by a much more superficial thought. People like editors and cinematographers don't get enough credit. People always laud the director for his great accomplishments, but the average person doesn't realize how much of what they call direction is actually edition and cinematography, two things this movie is near perfect in. The shots are so perfectly composed and angled. They put you in a perfect perspective from which to view the movie, be it the eyes of the narrator or some omnicient bystander between a killer and his victim in an alleyway. The editing takes advantage of every moment, strobing during a tense fight or slowing the film just a bit, pausing movement and panning around so that you can see an entire scene. The control of situation is excellent. While much of that is owed to direction, I think that the cinematography and editing, aside from the great writing, acting and content, are what makes this movie for me. 10/10"
matthewhardin,"Oct 7, 2019",10/10,"The City of God (2002), directed by Fernando Meirelles and Katia Lund tells the story of a group of neighborhood boys that grew up in the ghetto in Rio de Janeiro, which is based on true story. The film is directed a way that contains multiple stories or chapters, to explain how their neighborhood evolved the way it did. Each of the main characters has their own chapter to show their evolution throughout the film. It contains acts of drugs, sex, violence throughout this the story, and the actors did a brilliant job recreating the storyline. This film applies different lighting, camera angles/elements and music play an important role when creating this film. The film utilizes a handheld camera to capture certain moments that allowed the audience to view events as how the charters would have. Due to the main character Rocket main desire to become a photographer, the directors utilize this plot story fact to show much of the film through his eyes. The music indicates what is building up in the film, such as upbeat and fast music playing when violence is on the horizon. Although this film contains such a strong presence of violence that leads you turn your head at moments, this element demonstrates the disgusting reality of the lively hood of people who live in slums such as this. I rate this film a 10/10 due to the accurate representation of gangs, poverty and crime. There is such a heavy presence of suspense, that it keeps viewers on the edge of their seats and constantly eager for what is to come. Overall an unforgettable film and a cinematic masterpiece."
sdurham-66337,"Oct 5, 2018",10/10,"This is one of the best movies I've seen in quite awhile. I had no idea what it was about going into it, and the rawness and humanity of it really hit me as I watched it for the first time."
karlysoy,"Oct 15, 2018",9/10,"I am a big fan of this foreign film, because it's nice to see directors having a different point of view then the classic Hollywood film. It's a fast pace movie with subtitles, but worth the watch. City of God is the epitome of a great foreign film. It showcases the classic struggle between right and wrong, in a twist of lifestyle differences. The raw directing style, coupled with a great soundtrack makes for a movie which many different kinds of people can enjoy. Whether you are a top scholar or someone just wanting to watch a film this movie is for both. The continuity of editing helped the movie flow. Also, the vicious cycle of the gangster lifestyle is portrayed with cringing accuracy. The many close up of characters help you sympathize with people you thought you wouldn't be able to. All in all, City of God is a very well done film which you can find yourself relating to a whole different lifestyle."
