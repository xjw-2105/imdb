AlsExGal,"Jan 16, 2010",9/10,"At the tender age of 26, when I still thought no film was complete without a car chase and a big explosion, Amadeus had me hooked. I went to see it multiple times back in 1984 during its initial release, back when the theater was empty whenever it played and before it was nominated by the Academy.This film is an unusual biography, and I often like to compare it with Ed Wood, since both Ed Wood and Salieri were men who gave everything they had to their respective crafts and came up short. Salieri, a contemporary of Mozart, has only one dream - to be a great composer. Predating the prosperity gospel by about two hundred years, Salieri mistakes obsessing with God over his own earthly desires with actual godliness, even being happy when his father - who objects to Salieri's musical interests - chokes to death and leaves Salieri free to pursue his musical dreams. He chalks this up to God's will for his career. Problems begin when Salieri meets a twenty-something Mozart at the court of the Emperor in Vienna, where Salieri is the court composer. Mozart is everything Salieri is not - profane, forward, and a great composer. Salieri starts down the road to insanity as he realizes the childish Mozart has all of the gifts he ever wanted and has been denied. However, Salieri is not an outright failure as was Ed Wood. In many ways he is something worse than a ridiculous failure - he is mediocre, and worse yet, he knows it.Salieri,angry at God for honoring a profane ungrateful boy like Mozart while ignoring his own one desire to be a great composer, swears to destroy Mozart. The strange thing is, as long as Mozart is alive, Salieri is the honored composer, not Mozart, though this just seems to infuriate Salieri even more. Salieri seems to be the only person in Vienna who recognizes Mozart's talent. This just begs the question - why did it never occur to Salieri that being able to recognize something as valuable before anyone else does is a talent in and of itself? After all, in 1975 the second best thing to being Bill Gates would have been to have recognized his genius and invested heavily in his success. But I digress.The cinematography and art direction on this film are outstanding. The visuals start out light and festive, matching Mozart's mood and prospects. As poverty, illness, and the guilt of his father's death close in on Mozart during the second half of the film, the mood and visuals become very dark to match what is happening in Mozart's own life. Highly recommended."
SnoopyStyle,"Dec 6, 2014",9/10,"The movie opens with an elderly Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) confessing to killing Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). He used to be one of the great composers of Europe but has since been forgotten. As a boy, he was jealous of Mozart. He was delighted that his boorish father died. He works his way up to being the court composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) in Vienna. He is eager to meet Mozart but finds a flamboyant immature sex-fiend. Soon his admiration turns into jealousy of Mozart's Godly gift. Mozart marries Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).Director Milos Forman injects a lot of energy into a period piece. Tom Hulce's laugh is infectious. However it's F. Murray Abraham that is the true driver of this movie. It's his jealousy and scheming heart that creates the depths for Mozart. His older self gives so much color to his disgust for Mozart. And the music is operatic. It is not just beautiful and grand but it's also hilarious. There's also special mention to Jeffrey Jones."
miknnik,"Jan 30, 2007",10/10,"I'd like to point out a few facts before I review the movie. First of all, Mozart died at home surrounded by his family, pupil and a priest. Secondly, the plot of Amadeus is not exactly original. Rimsky-Korsakov wrote a short opera called ""Mozart and Salieri"" with the bare bones of the story and the identical characterization of the two composers, and he used Pushkin's drama for the libretto. So, the rumor that Salieri killed Mozart has been around for almost a couple of centuries though we all know there isn't an iota of veracity in it.That being said, Peter Shaffer's movie adaptation of his own play is still an astounding achievement. Have you ever seen a movie based on your favorite book and come out of the movie theater rather disappointed though the film version faithfully followed the storyline of the book? Amadeus is definitely not one of those movies. Shaffer clearly understands the difference between stage and film; the story is more elaborate in the movie, and some of the lengthy lines are replaced with more subtle images and close-ups.I'm often surprised to find that people don't get that Amadeus is the story of the fictionalized character, Antonio Salieri, not the real one, who adored Mozart's music but hated everything else about him. In other words, the movie viewers are seeing Mozart through Salieri's eyes. Needless to say, his view is rather slanted. If you have read Shaffer's original play, you probably remember he describes Mozart's laugh 'grating.' In the film, this annoying laugh becomes more symbolic. Though Salieri speaks in front of a Catholic priest, he is actually having a one-sided discourse with God. At one point, he declares, ""One day, I will laugh at you. Before I leave this earth, I will laugh at you."" But as he is wheeled out of his room by an aide at the asylum, what we hear is that screeching laugh of Mozart--or is it? It becomes obvious as we watch that this movie is called Amadeus because that's what Salieri wished to be--God's beloved.The movie might give some viewers who don't know much about Mozart a wrong impression that he was a cad, and it gives incorrect information on some of his music (e.g.; the count in The Marriage of Figaro sings ""Contessa perdono"" AFTER he learns that the woman dressed in the maid's clothes is his own wife. There's no mistaken identity here. Read the title of the song--Countess, forgive me!), but these are minor offenses. Though I am a die-hard Mozart fan, I can laugh at tongue-in-cheek references to Amadeus in other movies. My favorite? In Guarding Tess, a secret service agent tells his partner, ""He (Mozart)'s a jerk. One day, a guy shows up with a mask, and he drops dead.""What's not to like about Amadeus? The tale Peter Shaffer tells is gripping, the actors are first- rate, and, of course, there's music. The selection of Mozart's music in the movie is excellent; you can truly enjoy the beauty of his music no matter how much or how little you know about it. In case you are wondering, a little tune Mozart plays on his back and hands crossed as a penalty at a party is Viva Bacchus from The Abduction from the Seraglio, a duet for Pedrillo and Osmin. Pedrillo, while singing this song, is trying to get Osmin, the harem guard, drunk to help his master rescue his true love. No wonder Schikaneder calls it 'our song.' And the improvised version of Salieri's welcome march is actually a famous song, Non piu andrai farfallone amoroso, from The Marriage of Figaro.As I said, I'm a huge Mozart fan, so my rating may be somewhat biased, but what the heck, I gladly give ten stars to Amadeus. I watched it close to a hundred times over the years, and it still gives me a great pleasure every time I see (and hear) it."
JamesHitchcock,"Sep 3, 2010",10/10,"Most films about composers- Ken Russell's ""The Music Lovers"" about Tchaikovsky and ""Immortal Beloved"" about Beethoven are examples- rely upon the cliché of the creative artist as tortured, neurotic genius. Perhaps we like to console ourselves for the fact that we are not ourselves geniuses with the thought that genius must be paid for in mental suffering. Of course, not all composers fit this stereotype- Haydn was stoical in the face of misfortune (including a miserably unhappy marriage), Rossini was a noted bon viveur and it was often said of Felix Mendelssohn that his forename (Latin for ""happy"") well suited his character. But when did you last see a biopic of Haydn, Rossini or Mendelssohn? ""Song of Norway"" told the story of Grieg, another composer who doesn't really fit the ""tormented genius"" label, but it bombed at the box-office.""Amadeus"", however, attempts to overturn this cliché with a vengeance. The Mozart portrayed in the early scenes is about the least tormented genius who ever lived, obnoxiously hearty and cheerful, without the slightest doubt about his own talents. The tormented character is his rival, Antonio Salieri, but Salieri is no genius; in his own mind he is a hopeless mediocrity whose talents pale into insignificance besides Mozart's.The story is told as a confession made by the now elderly, half- mad Salieri to a priest in 1823, long after Mozart's death, the earlier scenes being seen in flashback. As a young man, the deeply pious Salieri vows that if God will make him a great composer he will live a chaste, virtuous life and use his talents to God's glory. At first Salieri believes that his vow has been accepted. He quickly achieves fame and is appointed Court Composer to Emperor Joseph II. When Mozart arrives in Vienna, however, Salieri realises that the young man's music has a transcendent beauty which his own can never match.Salieri's attitude towards his rival is not one of simple jealousy. Were Mozart a man of his own austere, puritanical stamp Salieri would not resent him nearly so much. Mozart, however, is very far from being puritanical. He is not a bad man, but he is very young, and his are a young man's faults- brashness, overweening self-confidence, a bawdy sense of humour, a keen eye for a pretty girl and a lack of respect for authority. (Actually, those last two are not really faults at all). His most irritating characteristic is his high-pitched laugh like a braying jackass. In Salieri's eyes, however, Mozart is a vulgar upstart, a smutty, sex-obsessed boy. Salieri believes that God has cheated him, by denying him the musical talent he deserves and giving it to an unworthy recipient. (The title is an appropriate one; Amadeus was not only Mozart's middle name but is also Latin for ""beloved of God""). Salieri therefore plots a diabolical revenge against both Mozart and God.The director Milo Forman took the brave decision to cast little-known actors in the three main roles, F. Murray Abraham as Salieri, Tom Hulce as Mozart and Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's beautiful young wife Constanze. In each case, however, that decision paid off admirably. Constanze has sometimes had a bad press from biographers, but here Berridge portrays her as strong-willed but loving and kind-hearted.Both Abraham and Hulce were nominated for ""Best Actor"" Oscars, and it was Abraham who won. Good as Abraham is as the gloomy, saturnine Salieri, a man eaten up with obsessive hatred, I still think that Hulce should have beaten him. There is a remarkable contrast between the brash young jackass of the early scenes and the Mozart of the later ones- a more mature, serious family man who has learnt the meaning of responsibility and who is for the first time starting to experience worries- about his finances, about his health, about his career. Hulce's achievement is that he not only makes these two Mozarts equally believable but also indicates that they are not two distinct individuals but rather two aspects of the same complex personality. There are also good performances from Jeffrey Jones as the conscientious but bumbling and musically tone deaf Emperor Joseph and Roy Dotrice as Mozart's autocratic father Leopold.""Amadeus"" is not, and is not intended as, a factually accurate biopic of Mozart. As Peter Shaffer, who wrote both the screenplay and the play on which it was based, was well aware, there is no real evidence that Salieri was obsessively jealous of Mozart, and absolutely none to support the old legend that he murdered him. He was not in reality a celibate puritan- he had a wife, eight children and a mistress. Shaffer uses this legend as the basis of a fictional story which explores complex questions about the nature of artistic creativity and the relationship between man and God.The film, deservedly, won the ""Best Picture"" Oscar for 1984; indeed, it is in my view one of the finest films of the eighties. It works on a number of levels- as a lavish piece of ""heritage cinema"" recreating the Europe of the late 18th century (the sets and costumes are particularly fine), as an intellectual exploration of philosophical issues, as a well-acted human drama, as a fictionalised study of a great man. The soundtrack is heavenly, but that is only to be expected, containing as it does some of Mozart's greatest music.The film has had a curious side effect. It could have condemned Salieri to perpetual infamy as a jealous minor composer who was supposedly responsible for the death of a great one. Instead, it seems to have led to a revival of interest in his work; he is certainly better known today than he was in 1984. Many musicians would now regard him as something far more than the ""patron saint of mediocrities"". God may have answered Salieri's prayers long after his death. 10/10"
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 16, 2003",10/10,"I remember as a child, my sister told me to watch this film. That it was the best film she ever saw. I didn't watch it until I turned 10; finally I sat myself down and watched it. I fell in love with it.Based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played a terrific and hilarious performance by Tom Hulce. This also has the life of Antonio Salieri, a great and well deserved Oscar winning performance by F. Murray Abraham. Despite the story not being accurate, come on! This is a great movie that was a gigantic Oscar waiting to happen. Congrats to Amaudeus for bringing the beauty of classical music into out living rooms.The story is that we start off with an older and more suicidal Salieri who blames himself for Mozart's death. When a priest comes to ask Salieri to plead forgiveness to the lord and wants to council him, Salieri describes who he was and how music inspired his life, he plays a few notes from his opera's that were masterpieces, the priest just looks at him not knowing the music. Salieri just looks at him with a smile and says ""Ah, how about...?"", he plays Mozart's most famous work and the priest gets excited saying ""Oh, how charming! I'm sorry, I didn't know you wrote that!"" smiling and knowing how it will please Salieri, Salieri just looks at him with a emotionless face ""I didn't. That was Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart"" and you see the priest's embarrassment. Just great and a perfectly played out performance by Abraham and Frank.Tom Hulce gives Mozart this crazy and annoying yet nevertheless funny laugh that you can't help but laugh at it every time he does it. He brings such life to Mozart and an immaturity that I think some of us can relate too in being spoiled and always knowing you're the best at your talent. He marries Constanze played by Elizabeth Berridge and she does it remarkably well. Constanze is obviously the more mature one and is the only woman who can try to tame Mozart's crazy ways. When Salieri gets a little jealous that the emperor played by an under rated Jeffrey Jones, since he is the emperor's tutor, then the emperor demands more of Mozart and his music. Salieri vs. Mozart: on the next celebrity death match!""Amadeus"" is a fantastic movie that anyone could easily love and enjoy. It's definitely a must see for movie fans and anyone in general who is just looking for a good movie. This was the best picture of 1984 and it's well deserved, just trust me and the awesome reviews it's getting!10/10"
mario_filipe,"May 23, 2004",10/10,"I thought that it would be impossible to make a movie like this one! Peter Schaffer's original play inspired Milos Forman, the great czech film maker, that surprised the world with ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"" (1975). The sublime, almost over-human performance by Frank Murray Abraham (the Mozart enemy and secret admirer, Salieri) is one of the keys for the movie success, mostly to it's depth. The perfect sense of timing by Milos Forman is admirable, he knows when to play wich music. All the scenarios: opera houses, palaces, streets, etc., are details absolutely harmonious! One of this classic secret was that Forman gathered ""the"" team, perfect team work.We can just admire it, laugh, cry, reflect, most of all, listen to it. See it, it's 10/10.Thank you Mr. Forman..."
richcarter150,"May 4, 2004",10/10,"In 1984, Saul Zaentz, Peter Shaffer and Milos Forman collaborated in bringing a truly remarkable life to the silver screen. The story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, through the eyes of rival composer, Antonio Salieri. The film is complete with an insightful script (courtesy of Mr. Shaffer), magnificent acting, wondrous sets and costume designs, incredible choreography (thanks to Twyla Tharp), and, above all, the glorious music of Mozart himself.The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of  music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions.The movie won eight Academy Awards in March of 1985. The only reason it did not win nine was that Tom Hulce was nominated for best actor instead of best supporting actor. He actually was in a supporting role, and in a strange twist of irony, F. Murray Abraham won the best actor statuette; citing probably the only time when Salieri beat out Mozart in anything.The movie itself was shot in Prague where Milos Forman said ""(It) is a gem because it's possible to pivot the camera a full three hundred and sixty degrees and never encounter a modern vision."" Very few new sets had to be built, as the scenes and buildings they found were quite often apropos to their needs.Amadeus works well on virtually every cinematic plane that exists. It is a masterpiece that must be viewed multiple times to receive what the film has to offer. The emotions of humanity, through the eyes of the troubled Salieri, indeed speak for all of mediocrity. He is their champion and their king."
planktonrules,"Mar 11, 2012",7/10,"Sometimes, it's hard to be a retired history teacher. After all, when I see many historical films, I see the errors in the script--where the writers take HUGE liberties with facts. As a result, you would NOT want to go to certain movies (such as ""Pocahontas"") with me, as I invariably complain about the crappy writing and lack of historical accuracy. While ""Amadeus"" is a gorgeous film to watch, it is also a film you would probably not want to watch with me! While vaguely following the events of the adult Mozart's life, so much of the film is wrong--terribly, terribly wrong. And, in the process, the film does a terrible disservice to the memories of the folks portrayed in the film. To me, history is like a holy book--you don't just change it to meet your needs--but here in ""Amadeus"", facts just aren't particularly important. In the film, Antonio Salieri is a bitter, nasty no-talent. It's easy to urinate on his memory today--it's not like he has family members who will defend him after 200 years! And even worse is the portrayal of Mozart who is shown to be a two-dimensional man. On one hand, he's a musical genius. On the other, he's a blithering idiot whose laugh makes your skin crawl--and there's absolutely no evidence that this aspect of the character is the least bit like the real Mozart.Now if you completely ignore history, the film is good---very good. The sets and costumes are lovely and it looks as if you have been transformed back to the 18th century. It certainly deserved Oscars for Art Direction, Costume Design, Makeup, Direction, Sound and other technical categories. F. Murray Abraham is great as the conniving Salieri--even though he's very fictional. Tom Hulce, on the other hand, is so annoying at times with his horrid and piercing laugh that I could see why this film didn't result in him being catapulted into stardom. Without this laugh, he would have been MUCH better.Why couldn't they have just created a story about FICTIONAL characters instead of fictionalizing real peoples' lives? If this had been done, the film would have been exceptional in every way. As it is, it's a severe irritant to anyone wanting to know about the real life characters portrayed so badly in this film. And that laugh...that HORRIBLE laugh has got to go!"
dr_foreman,"Jan 23, 2004",10/10,"Now, this is my idea of a movie - spectacle, religion, sex, envy, and some of the most stirring music ever composed.  And it all seems so modern; a bad visit from Mozart's father is awkward in the same way as a bad visit with my own parents!  Here's a film that makes ancient history seem like yesterday, using the same trick employed by all classic films - solid characterization.It's a shame that so many of these actors never did much else, but maybe that's a blessing in disguise because it allows them to embody their characters without other movie associations getting in the audience's way.I was worried that the extended edition would hurt the film's pacing (most extended editions are a bad idea - the material was cut for a reason!).  But in fact, all of the restored scenes are excellent.  I should have expected no less!  Beautiful costumes, beautiful locations, beautiful everything...very fittingly, ""Amadeus"" stands above and apart from the mediocrity."
son_of_cheese_messiah,"Aug 26, 2010",5/10,"In a telling scene, after Mozart has performed his genius work to tepid applause, Salieri, self-confessed patron saint of mediocrity, performs his to wild acclaim and receives a medallion from the emperor.That is rather like this receiving so many Oscars and so much praise.It is not a bad film, indeed it is often visually stunning, however at well over 3 hours it does flag in many places. The use of quite earthy American accents among the gentry of 18th century Europe is also somewhat grating (although this is what may have endeared it to the academy awards)however the real problem is the script.The script labours the same point of coarse genius versus pious mediocrity over and over. There is a curiously 20th century lack of deference to one's social betters (such as Mozart's wife constantly and annoyingly always referring to him as ""Wolfy"").But this pales by comparison to the hatchet taken to Salieri. The author has taken the real life rivalry and created a fantasy completely removed from history. Salieri had nothing to do Mozart's requiem or indeed Mozart's death. The true history is actually far more interesting than this fabrication.Salieri as written here, is a one dimensional villain. One almost expects him to be swirling a moustache. Of course this is merely a film, a piece of fiction. But since it deals with real historical characters, it does have a duty not to slander someone unfairly."
johndoherty,"Feb 4, 2001",10/10,One of the greatest movies of all time. This is a movie that speaks for itself. Beautiful Cinematography and stellar performances by all especially F. Murray Abraham who carries the film. Tom Hulce was a terrific choice for this movie.  True this is historically incorrect but it doesn't matter this film works on so many different levels... the music ahhh the music. Mozart is pure genius and his music touches this film and everyone involved. You can just sense that Mozart's inspiration drove everyone on this film to perfection. A must see film for all!
cgtam,"May 14, 2025",10/10,"This must be seen on big screen to fully appreciate the sumptuous beauty feast in real Vienna-like palatial settings, stage sets, churches & costumes. Pacing is well done & stands the test of time. Sadly films like these are not made in 30 yrs. Music alone is reason to view it, performed exquisitely, & staged with modern touch, remaining in Mozart's time. Great care & respect was given to Mozart's music as Austrian govt oversaw everything, filmed in Prague. Only wax candles were used for lighting giving it realism. Film appeals to those not into classical music/ period bc of excellent casting, direction, unique script, cinematography, & award deserving performances. See Director's cut which is excellent too.Here, 3 major scenes are cut from director's release. The dog scene is a real event in Mozart's life. Also omitted are scenes hinting how his wife was integral in his life. In reality Constanza was an opera singer & good house mgr. The 3rd omitted related fictional scenes are Constanza & Salieri arranging giving Mozart the Princess's teaching post. Also cut are vital snippets of all lead characters scenes, esp Salieri's narration re his growing ""revenge on God."" These omitted snippets add depth to ALL lead characters, esp Salieri's fictional motives in this film. Yet it creates compelling drama.The film's rivaly between 2 lead men is pure fiction, this play adopted to film is based on old Russian play published soon after Mozart's sudden death. Salieri condemned that play bc in life Mozart & he became amicable after Mozart gained court popularity. In reality, before Mozart came to Vienna as teen, Salieri was already wealthy, in powerful VIP royal post for most of his adult life, favored by nobility bc he was Italian tho he composed as German, lived long life in lux comfort, was influential musical prodigy himself, & later most sought after mentor. Mozart DID resent for YRS Austrian nobility's fashion trend favoring Italian composers as shown in this film.Mozart's music was deemed a modernist like Chopin & Beethoven in his time. He realized simple tunes one could whistle / hum = career. NO composer in human history affected public instantly in same manner. Music was created mostly for rich nobility. This Film omits Mozart's genius older sister who toured with him as child & her VIP role in aiding his compositions proved by his letters. She's also key in spreading & preserving his music after his death. She joined widow Constanze in promoting his music by teaching it to every student. Constanze sang his arias in concerts & got a royal pension from Emperor Joseph. Due to both ladies lifelong efforts, most of Mozart's music remains preserved esp after his originals were stolen.This film does sprinkle some known bio facts throughout. Mozart indeed fell OUT of royal favor & income bc he lacked proper diplomacy. Refusing to be under anyone's control, Mozart remained adult freelance musician usu for rich, a difficult career, & lived well but gained debts. Mozart knew his Death Reqium Mass authorship would be ""stolen"" by nefarious nobleman who did same to well known artist. Yet as Mozart lay very ill 15 days before he died, he wrote the Requiem mass for himself, knowing his death was immanent. Salieri visited him then, too. Mozart was surrounded by loved ones when he passed & had 2 public funerals. He had ""childlike humor"" but did not heavily drink.Not all these above facts are in the film. Yet the ESSENCE of Mozart's life, esp Tom & F. Murrey both embrace & breathe life into these historic men. Also present in film re Mozart are: Dad's pressures, his concerns, pre marriage issues, some royal court/ society protocols, politics, controversial subject matter (Figaro), HUGE jealousy from other composers / critics, his new inventive music compositions many snobs dismissed via envy; Mozart bravely changing opera topics by adding comedy & new characters, Mozart's EGO. ALL the complexities of a unique eccentric genius whose music conquered the globe are in this lavish banquet for eye & ear drama film, filled with humor too. No diary of Mozart's life exists, only few paintings of his side view remain. To the harsh critics, this film never touted itself as a dull docu.Mozart was not buried in ""paupers grave."" He was later exhumed & reburied in worthy monument grave that remains now. His last lovely flat also remains a museum.This now restored 1984 film DEF must be seen in one's life, worth $, & likely unforgettable, esp the music itself which can be bought, rented, heard on Utube; discs loaned from libraries incl film. When it premiered/ played, ALL sat silently during long end credits mesmerized by his music."
secondtake,"Mar 3, 2012",10/10,"Amadeus (1984)A million reviews have been written about this deserving movie--and the big points are good ones. And debatable.One, the play was better. Maybe. The play couldn't use cinematic tricks for its effects, but the movie really took it all much further in movie terms. It's a movie, not an adapted play.Two, it's inaccurate. Yes. Of course. It's a dramatized movie based on an historic figure. The truths are plenty--the boy genius, the patronage, the music scene in general. The fictions are worth noting, mainly that Salieri didn't kill Mozart (there is zero evidence of this, just chatter). Salieri didn't transcribe Mozart's final Requiem at his death bed. And Mozart's wife didn't sound like a ditzy American. Of course.Three, the operas are staged in contemporary terms, like dry ice effects. The venues are appropriate, and in fact, Mozart's time is not that far from ours, not in the larger picture.Speaking of venues, the whole city of Vienna looks terrific--because it's actually Prague. Go to Prague now and it'll have the same effect, though without the gray severity. Yes, Mozart was buried in a common grave. Yes he died too young from still uncertain causes (see Wikipedia for a full rundown of likely options). And yes, he was pretty innovative and radical. And if not as silly as Tom Hulce's interpretation, still a renegade socially and musically.Is it a good movie? Yes, a great movie. Who won't like it? Well, people with an aversion for historical dramas might, but even here, it zooms with such crazy, fun, funny energy, I don't know why it wouldn't just suck people in. Eventually though there are short scenes that are basically straight opera, with some continuing story along the sidelines. If you hate hate opera, you might have to just marvel at the sets and crazy crowds.There isn't a bad actor here, or a bad moment, really. And the music, the music! It's wonderful. The performances, take note, are by the high water mark of Mozart performances in the 20th Century--Sir Neville Mariner leading his famed orchestra. Likewise, the opera productions are by one of the great talents of the era, Twyla Tharp. The director Milos Forman has a short resume but it's impressive, including ""Hair"" as a kind of precursor and ""One Flew over the Cuckoo's Nest"" as proof of some kind of higher ability. (Forman hasn't always been on target, though, notably with his highly polished but pushy and almost abusive ""Goya's Ghosts,"" which has a similar structure to ""Amadeus,"" building a large world around a true rebel artist.)Anyway, a marvelous movie, a truly lovely experience, beautifully filmed, intensely envisioned, and acted with aplomb (F. Murray Abraham is a wonder as Salieri, young and old). And it is layered with some of the most emphatic and resolved music ever written."
DRIAINCLARK,"Apr 1, 2002",N/A,"The unseen star of this film is the Academy of St Martin's in the Field, London. Buy the soundtrack and you will be rewarded with some of the most stunning music you can hear. Mozart's music excells with brilliant treatment and dies with a bad performance. And that, after all, is what the film is about. Without his music, Mozart would be lost in time, a fate that the narrator of the story, the composer Salieri, saw as his own. Ironically, while Salieri has indeed been completely overshadowed by Mozart, his music still survives and has its followers.But beyond the music this is an outstanding film. Set in the prettiest and most flamboyant century of the last millennium, it is visually stunning and the writer's portrayal of jealousy is perceptive. The casting of the Austrian King and courtiers, (indeed all the actors in this film) that Mozart needed to impress capture the gentility and courtesy of the time, and also subtly shows their growing indignation and impatience at Mozart's personality and behaviour; the presentation of Mozart as punk musician is probably the only failing in the film. As a theatrical device to show that genius can come in disastrous packages it succeeds well, but anyone with any historic sense of social ettiquette or manners will know that Mozart's sill y behaviour would be well wide of the truth, as might, perhaps, be the concept of Salieri as murderer-in-chief. Only in the final scenes is Mozart's brilliance as a composer truly explored in what amounts to a deconstruction of his final composition - his moving, uncompleted and poignant Requiem mass.Another unintended star in this film are the candle lit sets and theatres of the 18th Century; their operas and drama ooze a magic  that is lacking in the present world and which modern producers might well try to reintroduce; so lovely are these buildings with their flickering lights and theatrical techniques that one is left desperate to to seek out these rare theatres to experience them.This film leaves one breathless from its visual beauty, its magnificent score and the choreography, indeed, of the two together. Mozart's life had the air of tragedy, and his undoubted genius speaks to us now and forever. This film is a monument to the skills of the writer, maker, performers and, of course, Mozart's music. If you have not yet done so, see it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 7, 2010",10/10,"I adore classical music, and Mozart is one of my favourite composers. When I came across Amadeus in my local charity shop, I knew I had to buy it. I watched it, and I loved it from start to finish. It is true it is not necessarily a true depiction of Mozart's life, but I was so blown away by the quality of the acting, sets, costumes and music that I forgot about that. The film is just gorgeous to look at, Vienna in the film (Prague in real life) looks beautiful, but the sets and costumes are colourful and lavish. The music is utterly majestic, from the Marriage of Figaro, Queen of the Night(brilliantly sung in what is one of the most difficult colouratura arias ever), Requiem in D minor to Don Giovanni, it was a feast to the ears. The script I thought was of exceptional quality particularly during the finale of Marriage of Figaro(one of the most beautiful tender moments in any opera is where the countess forgives her husband), and the direction was very fine. As many reviewers have pointed out, this is more about the mediocrity and envy of Salieri than it is of the eccentric genius of Mozart, thus the story was compelling and intriguing. The acting is wonderful; Tom Hulce is excellent as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, yeah his laugh is a tad grating, but I loved the manic and eccentric interpretation Hulce gave. Elizabeth Berridge is suitably petite and alluring as wife Constanze while Jeffrey Jones is delightful as Emperor Joseph II. For me though, F Murray Abraham gave the film's best performance, for he was absolutely outstanding as Salieri. Overall, brilliant film, gorgeous to watch, amazing music and essentially a must see! 10/10 Bethany Cox"
handelian-77847,"May 25, 2021",6/10,"This is indeed a very well-made movie but it is based on the extremely dodgy fiction that Salieri somehow caused Mozart's death. Most of it is absolute hokum including the portrayal of Mozart. Of course he was not the heavenly boy of a legend but neither was he the character portrayed here. He was of course a highly sophisticated man of the enlightenment. Scheffer appears to have thought that because Mozart wrote crudities into his letters to friends, he was like that with everyone. A totally absurd assumption. At least the film does not go as far as the play in that regard. So while there is much to enjoy here, there is also much that is total rubbish. For example, the implication that Salieri was celibate is complete nonsense as the man was married. He was a very respected composer in his day even though his music went out of fashion. Even as his works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart were among the most famous of his pupils. Not a bad legacy. Rather than being bitter rivals, Salieri and Mozart had a respectful relationship. The other point of the film which is ridiculous is the portrayal of Joseph the Emperor. He was actually a very fine amateur musician. So although it is a very entertaining movie it is rotten history and the problem I have this many people will take it as true. It is hokum."

I really did admire this movie, everything in it was very interesting and after I watched the film I did a little research on Mozart. The script and directing was superb and the cinematography was brilliant. I couldn't of asked for a better film than Amadeus. I'm glad I saw this film!Hedeen's outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
bandw,"Dec 13, 2013",6/10,"I am sure that casting Tom Hulce as Mozart was a great risk, but unfortunately that was the main thing that kept me from enjoying this movie. It wasn't all Hulce's fault, since there was a decision to have him insert an exceedingly irritating cackle at pretty much random points. Whoever dreamed that up must have really liked the idea, since there is one final cackle that closes the movie after all of the end credits have run. Hulce's attempts to act as an orchestra conductor were on a par with what you would expect from some untutored middle school student, what with gesticulations that mainly just kept the beat.Mozart was a musical genius who challenged the hidebound opinions of the times as to what was deemed acceptable. In that he is little different from early rock-and-roll stars. As presented he was a young, brash, free spirit (so at least the audience was spared the ponderous, agonized artist trope) with few endearing qualities. Granted, there seems to have been a large disparity between Mozart the person and his incredible music, but I cannot believe that he was quite the fool as what is seen here; the personality set forth was not credible to me. If only we had a time machine.There are some good things, like a couple of good performances. F. Murry Abraham is a standout in his subtle portrayal of Antonio Salieri. In this movie Salieri is a tragic figure. He was a popular and respected musician in the court of Emperor Joseph II. Beethoven and Schubert were among his students and I think Salieri gets somewhat of a bum rap in this movie. Solieri's torture was to recognize the difference between his talents and the pure genius of Mozart causing a serious conflict between jealousy and awe. I have seen this scenario played out in the workplace and it would have worked out for the best if the inferior party had just accepted that he was out-gunned; the results were unfortunate, as with Salieri. I thought that Jeffery Jones was particularly effective as Emperor Joseph II. He could walk the fine line between haughtiness and genuine feeling with aplomb.The staging of the opera segments is brilliant. In fact a movie with just extended opera segments, so presented, would be a treasure. As appropriate, Mozart's music plays a central role. But they never let it play for any decent length of time. Particularly irritating was the interruption of the staging of the final scene of ""The marriage of Figaro"" with a voice-over from Salieri. Couldn't they at least spare a few minutes to let the audience appreciate one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written? If that piece does not convince anyone of Mozart's genius, then there is no hope that that appreciation will ever be sparked. At least they had enough sense not to interrupt the Lacrimosa from Mozart's Requiem played over his burial. The brief scenes from ""The Magic Flute"" left me wanting more--the translation into English for those scenes was clever.The production is lavish and a delight to watch. The film deserved its Oscar for costume design--the costumes must have been a major expense. The filming is first rate with sets and architecture that created (at least for me) a feel for what 18th century Vienna must have been like. Some scenes were filmed in an opera house where Mozart himself conducted."
ThomasDrufke,"Sep 12, 2016",5/10,"With all its colorful and dazzling visual and audio flare, Amadeus is one for the ages. But I never really connected to the characters, and that's where it fails for me.Winning 8 Oscars in 1985 and numerous other accolades, it's safe to say Amadeus is one of the more beloved films of the 80's. It also comes from the great director behind One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, Miles Forman. But what Amadeus lacks is subtly. I understand a film about grand-scale music and opera's needs to have a unique identity, but I found Tom Hulce's eccentric title role-performance to lack the human touch.Of course, Amadeus isn't strictly about Mozart himself, it deals with his ""rivalry"" with Italian composer, Antonio Salieri and the various trials and tribulations of Mozart's wish to display his talents to the world and particularly, the Roman Emperor. These events are told in flashbacks by Salieri as he was recently committed to an Insane Asylum after attempted suicide. As far as we know, most of the events of the film are highly fictionalized or exaggerated. Normally, I don't mind such a choice in storytelling, but it seemed to bother me this time around.What didn't bother me, however, was the performance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. Covering decades, Abraham brings a totally different vibe to both the old and younger versions of Salieri, and both work extremely well. It's also worth noting that his character isn't all that likable on paper, but he brings the grounded humanity, especially in his jealousy for Mozart, that's missing from the rest of the film.Another thing Amadeus has going for it is the glorious music used and conducted for the film. Surely, most of the tunes are genius-ly written by the original composers, but the overall sound quality and editing is brilliant. Putting character dialogue aside, merely listening to this film is a joy.I may be in the minority here, but to me, a film must do more than just sound great, it has to move me emotionally in one way or another. The made up story has its fascinating moments, but it gets old after a while. As does the over-the-top performance from Hulce. Sure, a wonderful soundtrack and Abraham's performance are impressive, but it's not enough to get this to a positive review for me.+Abraham+Music-Hulce-Characters lack humanity-A tad long5.8/10"
tfrizzell,"Sep 26, 2000",N/A,"""Amadeus"" is a great film that is deep, thought-provoking, and overall exceptional.  The film deals with the last few months of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's (Oscar-nominee Tom Hulce) life, told in flashbacks by an old, washed-up musician named Antonio Salieri (Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham). Salieri tells of the genius, the ingenuity, and the insanity of the young musician who died mysteriously at the age of 35.  Salieri's jealousy may have led him to kill the young composer, but that is something that will never be known.  ""Amadeus"" is an interesting commentary that tries to fill holes in history and succeeds amazingly.  By mixing fact and probable fiction, the film-makers succeeded in creating a truly remarkable motion picture that is easily one of the best of the 1980s.  5 stars out of 5."
VWaltz77,"Aug 17, 2003",9/10,"After recently purchasing the Director's Cut & viewing the film with the 20-plus minutes of added scenes, I really appreciate the character of Stanzi so much more.In the original theatrical & D.V.D. release, I believe that many people claimed that Stanzi's character really lacked depth, where as all of the other performances were great.In the newly released Director's Cut, there are a few scenes (most notably the Stanzi-Salieri seduction sequence) that add such a great deal of depth to the Stanzi character. For example, her distant behavior/bitterness towards Salieri (at the end of the film), her protection of her husband & his well-being, her humanity as a woman, etc. are so much more easily understood in this version. In the original theatrical/D.V.D. release not much was presented about her character; audiences felt that this was due to actress Elizabeth Berridge's shortcomings as a performer, when I feel that it was more of a lack of her character in the screenplay & some unfortunate cuts in the editing process.Bottom line: This could be considered the ""Stanzi Edition"" as she shines in her supporting role & brings so much more to the film than she ever had before... 9/10"
sol-,"Feb 16, 2005",10/10,"A lavish, highly enjoyable production, the film is one of the finest biopics ever made, not just because of excellent production values, or the mystery element about the title person's death, but because it brings more to the depicted section of Mozart's life than just that. The film brings up and dives into deep religious issues and how important such religious beliefs were in the eighteenth century, and also it brings up some ideas about the profane mixed with the sacred. The whole production is wonderfully set to classical music, and it is technically superb in every area, with very good costumes and editing, as well as some fine acting, particularly from by Jeffrey Jones, who is as delightful as ever as Emperor Joseph. Nevertheless the film feels a bit lively in excess at times, and it never quite feels like it is in Vienna with the mixed accents, but still it is a quite a stunning achievement and simply superb entertainment. The film deservedly won 8 Academy Awards including Best Picture. A director's cut of the film was released too, running an extra twenty minutes at no detriment to the film."
redrobin62-321-207311,"Apr 29, 2017",10/10,"As of this writing, I have about 90 reviews on IMDb. I'd only began submitting reviews a few years ago, so the films I'd seen in the past were never reviewed by me. I thought I'd take the time now to give a quick review of the 10/10 films I'd seen in my life.First one up is ""Amadeus,"" and to me, the best film ever made. It's the movie I compare all others to, including classics like ""The Godfather,"" ""Citizen Kane,"" and ""Schindler's List.""""Amadeus"" has it all - excellent acting, excellent cinematography, excellent costume design, excellent music production, excellent set design, perfect combination of comedy and tragedy, and tons and tons of classic, memorable lines, especially those delivered by Salieri. I saw this movie in the theatres when it first came out. I was 18 years old and it made me fall in love with classical music.Director Milos Forman is truly a wonder, given that he's helmed quite a few films that made my top 25 list - ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""Ragtime."" How fitting it should be, then, that my favourite song of all time appears in one of his films, ""Hair."" Coincidence? I think not. The man's a genius, plain and simple. He's also caused me to structure some of my screenplays and novels based on ""Ragtime."" Talk about influential."
vincentlynch-moonoi,"Feb 24, 2011",8/10,"There's no denying that this 1984 biopic, directed by Milo Forman and written by Peter Shaffer, is a great film. It's a story about the old adage -- life is unfair. In fact, just to demonstrate how unfair, it probably should have been entitled ""Salieri"", rather than ""Amadeus"", because its really the story of Salieri and his bitterness over the success of his contemporary. But, the average person is somewhat familiar with Mozart, so let's be commercial about entitling the film.If you are ""into"" classical music, there will be little to dislike about this film. You'll find a great story and lots of the music in which you revel. If you are not really into classical music, but are watching for the story, you may find the film a bit long with some sections highlighting the music (opera scenes) a bit lengthy. I'm the latter, but still, this film maintains your interest.One interesting aspect of the film is that Salieri tells the story of his rivalry with Mozart as a sort of confession to a priest, after the court composer has been placed in a lunatic asylum for attempting suicide. And, though brief, the scenes in the asylum are chilling. I think the technique of flashbacks in films is overused, but is perfect for the telling of this story, because it allows Salieri (Abraham) to narrate the story effectively, thus aiding in understanding his feelings and motives. It may be a little difficult for us to understand that Salieri supposedly saw his musical talents as a product of his devotion to God -- a different time, to be sure. Mozart's irreverent and lewd general behavior surprised me, and in the light reading I did after viewing the film, appears to be accurately portrayed. Hence the source of Salieri's bitterness -- God appears to have graced the rude and obnoxious Mozart with the talent, while nearly bypassing the serious efforts of the pious Salieri. I did find Mozart's childish squeal of a laugh quite entertaining. Salieri comes to believe that God is using Mozart's genius to cruelly laugh at Salieri. Hence, Salieri's plot to kill Mozart, though the latter actually dies from exhaustion (?) -- the film not clear at all about the actual reason for death (and does not make obvious the many medical struggles Mozart has through his life). Particularly considering the length of the film, I would have liked a couple of minutes more dialog by Salieri describing Mozart's funeral and burial...just to put it all in more understandable perspective -- why the anonymous burial in a mass grave -- common at that time? What's interesting is that both Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham were nominated for Academy Awards (the latter won), but neither went on to luminous careers in film. The film won 8 Oscars in all, and deservedly so."
ave27,"Apr 2, 2011",9/10,"Not only did I enjoy watching this movie, but it also stuck with me afterward. In most respects it is well put together. The story if multidimensional and carries the viewer along well. The acting is superb; F. Murray Abraham as Salieri is flawless, Tom Hulce gives a fleshed-out portrait of Mozart's brilliance and his (according to the film) frivolous personality, and Elizabeth Berridge and the other principal actors put in solid performances too. The music works well with the scenes; my only complaint is that some of the opera scenes get a bit long. However, all in all this is an excellent piece of work. It is not historically accurate, but if one keeps that in mind, what harm can it do to appreciate its beauty?"
mstomaso,"Dec 26, 2005",9/10,"Amadeus presents a heavily fictionalized, speculative portrayal of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart's last years, focusing powerfully on his relationship with Italian composer Anthony Saliere, and Mozart's wife, Constanzia. My review is based on first seeing the theatrical release in the theater during its first run, and then viewing the director's cut twice. In my opinion, the director's cut is a much better film, though the theatrical release would still earn an 8 from me.Do not approach this movie looking for some objective presentation of historic fact. Do not go into this film expecting to see a tribute to one of the world's greatest composers. Do not see Amadeus in order to understand the workings of musical genius. Inasmuch as all of these are incomprehensible - probably as much to those who lived them as they are today - Amadeus fails to achieve any of these laudable goals. What is does achieve - and quite well - is the blending of elements of Mozart's personality, aspects of his historical context, and an ingenious plot which is spelled out in a very clever narrative style. The truth you get out of Amadeus - as with most good historical fiction films and novels, is the truth of the feeling of a particular time and place.Amadeus immerses its audience in Europe's 18th century, but has just enough anachronism in its script to prevent losing its audience there. Mozart is a young prodigy who struggles with his own ego, over-sensitivity, arrogance, and self-destructiveness against a world which does not really know what to make of him. Salieri (Abraham) is his most ardent fan and admirer, but harbors a deep personal and professional jealousy, as well as an overwhelming self-centered guilt, and an even deeper conviction that his own perceived inadequacies reflect on his relationship to his creator. The third character, much better developed in the director's cut than in previous versions, is Mozart's wife Constanzia (Berridge) - seemingly the only fully rational and practical person among the principal roles. The film narrates the twists and turns of fate - the intrigues and folklore - which, even today tend to crowd out the facts of this part of Mozart's life.Hulce, playing Mozart in what is easily his greatest performance to date, utters a couple of highly anachronistic and off-color remarks in the course of the film. ISince I do not hold historical FICTION to some arbitrary standard of authenticity, I can say that my reaction to these was probably exactly as they were intended: (1) Either Mozart was so creatively explosive that he occasionally happened upon 20th century phraseology through sheer coincidence and/or (2) We are supposed to find these phrases a little shocking and they are used as plot devices to give the film a sense of surreality. Either way, the films works very well as a work of art and a good story, and what some describe as problems of authenticity are, to my mind, nothing more than artistic license. Most movies are not meant to be encyclopedic recitations of 'what really happened'. Keep that in mind before you commit to watching this. The only danger with regard to this film is that it is SO compellingly portrayed that some people are likely to walk away from it believing that this REALLY is what happened.F. Murray Abraham, who almost always does well, exceeds himself in this film, and well deserved his Oscar. Hulce is remarkable and the supporting cast are easily up to the task. The directing is subtle enough to be somewhat refreshingly unnoticeable, and the script and editing are excellent (at least in the director's cut). Very little can be said about the use of period music and costume which has not been said in the numerous awards and the high praise received from critics.This is a great film. Highly recommended for adults of any age."
doomedmac,"Apr 12, 2020",7/10,I really don't understand the hype for this movie. It's good; not the best thing ever.
Nameless,"Dec 13, 1998",10/10,"F. Murray Abraham portrays Salieri, a hard working but mediocre composer driven mad by the arrival of a ``natural'' talent, Mozart (played by Tom Hulce) in a highly political environment.  The movie provides some crucial insights into the motivations of the characters, and shows both a superficial image and reveals deeper truths (e.g. Mozart appears to party all the time, but is actually a very diligent worker). I am uncertain as to the historical accuracy, but this movie (i) was entertaining, (ii) inspired a greater love and knowledge of Mozart's Music, (iii) dramatized the undoing of a great talent by both external forces and his own weaknesses (iv) has great costumes and music and (v) has a great supporting cast."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 23, 2025",10/10,"Salieri nears the end of his life, having confessed to killing Mozart, the man he believes destroyed his purpose, and explains to a priest how Mozart climbed to the top.Amadeus remains a great watch. I cannot decide if it's a comedy or a tragedy - the truth is this timeless classic sits sorrowfully and joyously in the middle.For balance, I listened to some of Salieri's music - pleasant, talented - and then Mozart's Moonlight Sonata. The difference is staggering; Mozart's genius feels effortless, almost unfair, which really helps explain Salieri's torment.As the film progresses, Mozart's physical and mental decline becomes impossible to ignore; you're left questioning whether his relentless brilliance, his genius, ultimately killed him - and that day, in a sense, it did.What makes it such a fun watch is that it's a story of a story. We're given the story of Mozart's rise, but it's filtered through Salieri, who despises him, so perhaps that accounts for a little inaccuracy and Mozart being a little over the top. The more everyone tries to put Mozart down, the greater he climbs, the more innocent and exuberant he becomes. Imagine being in Salieri's shoes - like being the best player at a tennis club, only for Carlos Alcaraz to take up permanent residence.The visuals are beyond spellbinding: the costumes, the wigs, the streets, the sets, and the opera itself. It must be one of the most beautiful films in existence.The acting is sublime. Tom Hulce is sensational as Mozart - flamboyant, exuberant, and a little annoying, but absolutely embodying genius. Contrast that with the stoic brilliance of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri: a man tortured, pushed to question his belief in God. Their interplay is mesmerizing.10/10."
Quinoa1984,"Feb 8, 2001",9/10,"Amadeus actually caught my attention, in parts. It has excellent performances from F. Murray Abraham as a semi-famous musician who is incredibly jealous yet fascinated with the prodigy Amadeus, played to utter perfection by Thomas Hulce (love that laugh). The theme of competition is one that director Milos Forman latches onto and gets enough juice and dramatic tension to pull off the epic nature of the film, both personal and extreme. Often quite good, however suffers from the overlong-ness and sometimes it is impossible to keep attention, however it snaps back every once in a while. Period detail and is to the dot. And the music makes up anything else I could want in a film. A-"
Galina_movie_fan,"Feb 22, 2006",10/10,"Mozart is my favorite composer, I love his music, all of it - his symphonies, concertos, operas, Requiem, you named it. I've read many books about him; I try not to miss any concert where his music is performed. I know that ""Amadeus"" the movie is not exactly his biography, and his relationship with Antonio Salieri, with his father Leopold, with his wife Constanze Weber, with the Emperor Joseph II and with the court musicians in Vienna of 18th century, might not have been exactly like it was shown in the movie, and Mozart himself might not have laughed as Hulce did but I LOVE the movie. I've seen it many times and I still love it. It is about a conflict between a genius for whom to create was as easy as to breath, and a talent that realized that no matter how he tried, he can not be a genius. It is very easy to admire a genius from the distance; it is unbearable to be next to him and to realize that you never will reach the same heights. Admiration, contempt, hatred, denial, self-hatred and above all of these ""monsters with green eyes"" -divine music that will live forever, music oblivious to the dark passions, music that makes us feel the presence of perfection and harmony...Once again, ""Amadeus"" is not a biography, at least I don't see it as such. It is a work of fiction and a wonderful film that did not make me see a real Salieri as a villain. Having read many materials about Mozart and his time, and having listened to the music from his epoch, I have a respect for Salieri and his music which is quite charming.Amadeus - beloved of Gods and taken by them too early because those whom they love die young."
bkoganbing,"Oct 5, 2007",9/10,"Long after his rival died at a young age and his world essentially obliterated by the Napoleonic wars, Antonio Salieri as played by F. Murray Abraham looks back on his life from the confines of an insane asylum. Everywhere the music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is played and hummed familiarly by even the masses. Scholars study Salieri, the people from all walks of life listen to the notes that Amadeus put down for posterity.Amadeus is a wonderful recreation of the court at Schonbrunn Palace in Vienna during the age of reason. The Hapsburgs have now become the House of Hapsburg-Lorraine as a result of Maria Theresa becoming the first female monarch of their empire. The empire and the court are now ruled by her son Joseph as played by Jeffrey Jones.What I liked about the film is that author Peter Shaffer obviously researched with great care the period this rivalry between Salieri and Mozart takes place. Jones remarks on more than one occasion about letters he got from his sister Antoinette from the French court and what she's observing, but not quite understanding.Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved. Besides those already mentioned I think you will enjoy Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's long suffering wife and Roy Dotrice as his more staid and settled father who can't cope with a mercurial genius of a son any better than Abraham can.And Amadeus brought a revival of interest in the old classical masters and that's always a good thing."
dataconflossmoor-1,"Feb 17, 2010",10/10,"What can you say about this movie's director, Milos Foreman? He is just simply superb at the itemization of complex human nature. The film, ""Amadeus"" is considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time! You would think that any director who lays claim to a film with such a stellar reputation would be at the pinnacle of his professional genius. The fact is, that in Foreman's case, he previously directed another film which has been critically earmarked as perhaps the most spectacular movie ever produced, that motion picture being: ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" Milos Foreman won the academy award for best director in '1975 for ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"", just as he won the academy award for best director in '1984 for ""Amadeus"". Foreman takes a monotonously challenging approach to his films. I am convinced that this world renowned director could build a perfectly designed New York City skyscraper using only a pair of tweezers. This is how detailed Milos Foreman actually is! ""Amadeus"" was a simply remarkable movie which engages in a comprehensive biography of one of the most masterful composers of classical music in the whole history of all creation, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. This movie depicts how Mozart did not even write the notes to his sheet music on script paper, he memorized all of the music which he originated !! That is just simply amazing! Clinically using the adjective, prodigal, for describing Mozart, would merely be a paramount utterance of understatement. The culprit to Mozart's vulgarity was due largely in part to his baroque environment! Mozart's corrupt candor cultivated a tailor made invitation for his spontaneity to allow his personality to open the floodgates for him to maximize his flourishing aggregate potential! The movie ""Amadeus"" purported an intensely vivid clarity for pointing out a great many of Mozart's talented attributes! In a time when Germanic culture carried an assertively chauvinistic aura with the world's paradigm, Mozart was convinced that if he was going to write an unequivocally marvelous opera, that this opera should be composed and expedited in Italian. The English translation for this opera was entitled ""The Marriage of Figaro"". The cerebral complexities to Mozart were simply astounding. The grass root recognition of ideological fervor which prevailed with the hierarchy during the period of nineteenth century Austria was portrayed with a very subtle disposition in this film! The rendition of Mozart's music which was performed by the Dallas symphony, and conducted by Edward Mata, was a compendium of Mozart concertos which I will emphatically categorize as marvelously top notch entertainment. When I was in Austria, while visiting Salzburg, I ate lunch at a restaurant which use to be Mozart's home. The plethora of Mozart artifacts in Salzburg were, to say the least, intellectually sensitizing! This enriching sojourn of mine became a reflective synopsis of how influential Mozart was to the entire spectrum of classical music. As a matter of fact, I became passionately imbued with an aesthetic appreciation for Mozart as a result of watching this film,!! Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart auspiciously revolutionized all of western civilization.The film ""Amadeus"" executes a successfully cogent expertise at illustrating Mozart as an aficionado with an artistic finesse and an unprecedented musical flair!! Winning the academy award for best picture back in 1984, this is just simply the introductory tip of the iceberg in terms of being an indicator of how wonderful this motion picture truly is. If you have not seen ""Amadeus"" yet, make it a point to do so. The acting is great, the cinematography is enlightening, and the directing, by one of the all time directors in the whole history of Hollywood film making, Milos Foreman, is totally sensational!! See this film!! Five Stars!! Perfect Ten!! No Question About It!!"
lllinggg,"Jun 9, 2003",6/10,"'Amadeus' is arguably one of the most ambitious films of the 1980s. It presents a popularized account of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart following his arrival in Vienna from Brno, at the age of 17. His reception by his new patron, Emperor Joseph II, disturbs courtier and established composer Antonio Salieri, who becomes consumed with a burning, selfish passion to physically eliminate Mozart, while recognizing the latter's unique musical genius.Aside from adding considerable interest to an otherwise prosaic script, Salieri's confessional narration that guides the film provides the vehicle for a truly phenomenal performance by actor Frank Murray Abraham. Milos Forman's thorough direction augments Abraham's superb theatrical delivery, and is in turn amplified by the outstanding soundtrack furnished by Sir Neville Marriner and the Academy of St Martin in the Fields.Inevitably, most of the remaining protagonists fade miserably in comparison to Abraham, including the overacting Tom Hulce, as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, and Elizabeth Berridge, as Constanze Mozart -both complete with distinct Yankee and Texan accents respectively. This latter aspect is arguably symptomatic of a deeper flaw in the film, which subscribes to a somewhat Americanized version of W.A. Mozart's character, overstressing the composer's historically unfounded maverick and nonconformist traits. There is also little -if any- historical evidence of any schemes by Salieri against W.A. Mozart. Indeed, the film's commitment to historical accuracy appears to be exhausted at a number of pictorial shots of Vienna and the striking facial resemblance of actor Jeffrey Jones to Emperor Joseph II.Yet, the film's daring illustration of the many negative sides of Mozart's character, including his artistic arrogance and his self-destructive womanizing, is commendable, as is its achievement to popularize the music of one of the icons of Western musical tradition. Overall a satisfactory result, 6.4 out of 10."
spiderdan,"Aug 7, 2002",1/10,"I saw Amadeus at the Cambridge Film festival. I was told it was the story of Mozart's life, was critically acclaimed and the pinnacle of the festival. How much was I disappointed, often irritated and by the end I felt thoroughly used and exploited by what I can only describe as a terrible, terrible film. But why? Well I was quite excited by the thought of a film about one of the greatest composers and musicians of all time, the potential to create really powerful film with some emotional and awe inspiring scenes accompanied by his most famous and rousing music was tremendous and, seemingly, obvious. Instead Amadeus chose to focus on how irritating Mozart the man was, and featured a few uninspiring scenes demonstrating his genius in composition. Good Will Hunting managed to make maths exciting, but Amadeus was given the most moving medium of all, Music, by one of the most incredible musicians who ever lived, and they made it more boring than dry paint that's been dry for a very long time.For such a critically acclaimed film I was expecting certain things. First was good music, but this was a taken. It was about Mozart, of course the music was good, it was Mozart. All they needed was Mozart's greatest hits playing in the background to be good! So I give it 0 points for the score, you want good classical music then buy the CD.  I would say that Fahrid Murray Abraham was very good as the narrator and main character, putting in solid performance. As far as the other acting is concerned the mixture of accents from Shakespearean English to Italian, German and inevitably American never related to the actual nationality of the character was enough for me to hate every performance, if I hear Elizabeth Berridge say Volfey in a German\American accent once more I consider suing for mental aggravation.You want good classical music with a complex story and impressive cinematography then watch 2001 A Space Odyssey. If you want the story of a flawed but fantastic composer then get Shine out on video, you wont be disappointed. If you prefer your musical period drama documentaries full of irritating actors, pretty costumes, tedious storylines and bits of opera then do watch this, and if you would prefer to while away your time for three mind numbingly boring hours then check out the directors cut. Amadeus, you owe me £5 and three hours of my life, I wont forgive you until I get them back. dan"
tombew,"Sep 9, 2000",N/A,"""Amadeus"", while historically inaccurate in numerous ways, is a brilliant film.  Its central character is not a man but an attribute of man at his most remarkable: genius.  Mozart's genius was at the highest level, on par with Shakespeare, Michelangelo and Balanchine.  Forman knew this when he undertook translating Peter Shaffer's play.  Although most of the acting is on a very high plane, the actors themselves are not top tier, not should they be.  A famous, easily recognizable actor would have detracted from the central thesis that genius is greater than the one on whom it has been entrusted.  Mozart was, of course, deeper than the character shown in the movie, but no personal life could equal the extent and depth of the musical genius that flowed from this little man.  The letters he sent to his father show a remarkable sensitivity and depth of understanding.  However, they are not paradigms of literary greatness.  The immense contribution of W. A. Mozart lay in some of the most sublime music ever written.  Fortunately, the film gave us snippets of some of the real gems in the Mozart canon: the great C Minor Mass, the Requiem and ""Don Giovanni"".  Forman realized that no human being will ever be great enough or have the background to pen such masterpieces without intervention from elsewhere.  This is certainly true of Shakespeare as well.  So what we have here, ultimately, is a celebration of genius, that great gift to mankind that nearly always proves to be too much for the person who is chosen to manifest it to the rest of us.  Many thanks to Milos Forman for the wisdom to keep out of the way and allow genius to shine through.  In that sense, ""Amadeus"" is an exercise in humility.  Few films come across as blessings for those who experience them.  ""Amadeus"" is one such film."
fsugirl0408,"May 19, 2009",8/10,"1. The Movie Making You Want More 2. When I heard about the film Amadeus, I was not very thrilled about seeing it. I didn't think I would be very interested or even like the movie in the end. As I watched the film I started liking it more and more. I feel this film deserved all the Academy Awards that it won. 3. Amadeus is a film about Mozart's life while in Vienna. Antonio Salieri is out to kill him because he is jealous of his success. The film starts out with Salieri in an insane institution looking back and telling a priest the whole story of Mozart. Mozart starts out in Salzburg, but soon gets kicked out of the town and decides to move to Vienna to further his career. With the help of the emperor of the Austrian-Hungarian Empire, Mozart is composing many various operas and writing symphonies. Mozart meets the love of his life Constanze and they have a child together. She is by his side the whole time, supporting him and praising him for the work he is doing. Mozart thinks that Salieri is actually trying to help him and one of his friends, but little does he know that Salieri is hoping that he dies. In the end, Constanze leaves him to decide and take some time away because Mozart has a very bad drinking problem. She eventually comes back, but doesn't come back to find the happiest thing. 4. I really enjoyed the film because of all the colors and settings. The settings were very broad and stood out. All the costumes and makeup were bright and catching of the eye. The scenery really used big props and had spectacular visual effects. The music was another big factor. The sound was enhanced to keep the viewer interested and wanting more from the film. When something bad was about the happen the music got really loud and the opposite when something good was about to happen. The transitions in the movie were very smooth. The movie didn't switch scenes really fast without warning. 5. I didn't really like how the film wasn't fully portrayed to the fullest. There were a couple things missing and things turned around to make the film more interesting. In real life, Mozart and Constanze actually had four kids. Salieri was not actually jealous of Mozart and he was famous at the time in composing his music. I didn't really like how the movie portrayed Mozart as being a bad person because he went out and partied all the time. This was what kept him going and focused on his music. It also wasn't portrayed well that his wife was nagging him all the time. 6. I really liked all the characters. The actors were all selected very well for playing the characters in this movie. I don't think anyone could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce. He had the serious times when it was needed and he had a sense of humor. I think certain audience members would be able to relate to certain characters. 7. I would love to see this film again and would recommend it to anyone. I didn't want the movie to end. I thought there was more to come and it just ended. You don't have to appreciate music to see this film. It has much more to offer and is a lot more interesting than someone would think. You also want to see this film to find out what happens at the end. This film is a must see. I would give this movie 8 stars."

gamezaston,"Jan 20, 2022",10/10,"I think that this film is just perfect the writing is smart, The Comedy is hysterical, It has a beautiful and haunting atmosphere, The acting OH MY GOD Antonio Salieri Is probably my favorite character in all of film and great imagery. I cant find anything wrong with with It. Many people would say that the whole movie is fictional. Reasons thats not true: 1. It's historical fiction it not supposed to be entirely true and 2. Most of It is true Mozart was a wild guy he liked sex jokes and fart jokes and he liked to brag he had I big ego, he was a crazy drunk. I also loved how this movie portrayed Mozart. The laugh that he makes is so contagious and his personality is so strange and 3. A life so strange couldn't be told in a straight forward way. Anyways this is and will always be my favorite film!"
Indy-52,"Dec 21, 2001",6/10,"I re-watched this film recently after many years, and my opinion of it hasn't changed. This is a terribly flawed, disappointing film that's unjustly considered a classic. It had great potential, a biography of the great Mozart seen through the eyes of a mediocre composer, but the result fails in many areas and leaves one confused and hugely disappointed. Everything about this film is top-notch except for one crucial element: the script. It lacks punch, it lacks heart, it lacks momentum, and it lacks any particularly memorable dialogue. The actors do their best with this below-par script, and so does the director and the entire crew, who deserved their Oscars, but the film really suffers from its by-the-numbers screenplay by Peter Schaffer. It's clear he's a passionate music-lover, but it's also clear he isn't able to construct a compelling narrative too. I've never seen the play, but I've heard it's better than this film. I certainly hope so. Somehow those moments that are intended to generate emotions in the audience never really pay off. We never feel like something horrible has happened, the events onscreen never really involve you, but make you hope the film will get better. Playing loud classical music on the background for dramatic impact may be effective for some, but not for me. However, the film is exceptionally well filmed. The cinematography, sets, and costumes make this a real visual treat, and the actors are all wonderful in their roles. And of course the classical music score makes for wonderful listening. With all these impressive elements, it's a shame that the film's core, the script, is so bland and uninvolving. No matter how good a cast and crew you've got at your disposal, if your script is mediocre, then your movie will be too, and AMADEUS is perfect proof of this."
p-j-collins,"Sep 7, 2012",10/10,"Quite simply, a perfect film - the only one (of many hundreds I have seen) that I would rate10/10. Characterisation and plot are superb; casting and acting are excellent. The film has been brilliantly adapted from an exceptionally good stage play. The plot is gripping, building up to one of the most moving finales one is likely to see. And on top of this there is the music, and the sets. Having just visited Prague for the first time, I was delighted to find that it is just as beautiful as I imagined it to be (after watching Amadeus). The Director captures the city perfectly, and it becomes a major player (rather like the Nostromo in Alien). It is hard to imagine how Amadeus could have been improved (and I don't think the 'Director's cut' is better than the film as it was originally released)."
xiaoguan,"Jul 7, 2005",6/10,"It is not a bad movie, certainly not a masterpiece as claimed by most people in this web page either. In total it is mediocre and forgettable. I really prepared to like it. I love this kind of theme: 'the burden bestowed together with gift. By the end you are not sure how to look at a genius mind: a blessing or a curse.' But it turned out to me a major disappointment. I was most deeply let down by the portrait of Mozart. I wouldn't have mind it so much if the movie hasn't kept on pressing the point via the statement of Salieri: the contradiction within Mozart - God's voice from a unworthy man. The movie totally failed itself in this aspect. On one hand Salieri went on and on with how magnificent and brilliant Mozart's music is that my head starts to ache. On the other hand Mozart has shown himself as a funny, sincere, self-confident man, cute and cuddly, with an off-beat laugh, a loyal son, a tender husband, simply an example of morality. It is a mystery that how come he didn't become the most popular man in Vienna. So many other works have done it much better, 'moon and six pence' and 'shine' to name a few, over the dark anti-social side of genius that 'Amadeus' in corporation only offered a very pale and shallow endeavor. Another thing bugged me is the other main character Salieri. He blamed himself to madness and tempted suicide. For what? What EXACTLY had he done to Mozart? True, he has not been a true friend to Mozart. Is that the reason Mozart died? No way. Those little tricks he had applied to harm Mozart, did they succeed? You better be kidding me. From what I can see they either missed miserably or by the unexpected turn of events helped Mozart instead. He hated Mozart and wished him dead, but that didn't make him a murderer. The director overdid the contrast between the two main characters and massed it up. And, the maid, played by the one of the ladies out of the sex and city. What an annoy! She lamenting 'Oh I am scared!' For what! and tears over Mozart's death. Again, for what? When did she grow so emotional over Mozart? What the director was thinking, did he forgot the story? Everybody hates Mozart, right? In conclusion, everything is pretty lame here, plot, direction and acting. Only recommended if you are an opera nut. Otherwise, skip it."
Cinemayo,"Jan 3, 2005",2/10,"To be blunt, I found AMADEUS to be one of the most Overrated and preposterous bores in all of motion picture history, and that goes back a long way now. It's not very often that I'm this clueless as to the almost universal appeal of a certain highly revered work of cinematic art, but I just couldn't help wondering just what was supposed to be so damned compelling about this very, very lengthy and dramatically vacant exercise in tedium?For openers, I just couldn't buy Tom (NATIONAL LAMPOON'S ANIMAL HOUSE) Hulce as ""the"" Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. From the very moment he first came on screen, groping after an equally miscast Elizabeth Berridge as his fiancée-wife, I knew I was in for a very rough ride; here I was only 20 minutes into this thing and already the leading lovers were utterly irritating ... and with 140 minutes left to go!Hulce looks like what he is - a 20th Century guy in a 1700's period white wig - and though she's actually over the age of 20, Berridge hardly appears old enough to play anything but his kid sister. Somebody should have told these two to lose their modern accents; Berridge loves to say ""gonna"" (""I'm not gonna marry you"") and she tells someone that ""only an idiot would ask Wolfie to work on that 'stuff'"". Oh well. All the same, I'd imagine that speaking in a proper 1700's dialect would have sounded even more out of date while delivering such silly dialog as this:MOZART: ""Here, everything goes backwards. People walk backwards and dance backwards and sing backwards and even talk backwards.GIRL: ""That's stupid"".MOZART: ""Why? People fart backwards...""How idiotic. But this is not limited only to these two bozos; even another character uses the modern expression: ""if you marry him you won't have a pot to p*ss in"". It also seems like the phrase ""kiss my ass"" was very popular back in the days of Mr. Wolfie, too.Enough about the dialog. There is still one glimmer of hope in all this mess - and that's F. Murray Abraham (who won the Best Actor Oscar) as Antonio Salieri. What very little there is to admire in this movie is solely owed to his interesting performance, and in the character himself. Maestro Salieri's overwhelming envy of his childish colleague's superior talents, and the gradual resentment he feels toward God for leaving him in the dust of mediocrity, is the only saving grace keeping the film from total ruin. It's a pity that this angle of the story was historical fiction, though.And then there was that giggle... that ever-present, idiotic giggle...* out of ****"
AngieMargie,"Apr 15, 2003",N/A,"When the two worlds of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart collide in Milos Forman's Amadeus, it is anything but a symphony. As the court composer of the Emperor of Austria, all Salieri desires are fame and recognition as a composer; it is all he had wanted his whole life. When he learns that Mozart, whose name he had known as long as he can remember, is going to come to the court to play, Salieri cannot wait to meet the outstanding and righteous man that he knows he must be. However, when Salieri learns that Mozart is a young, crude, and unrefined young man, endowed with all the talent and ability that he ever wanted and strived for, it plants a seed of jealousy that soon grows into bitter resentment and hatred, not only for Mozart, but also towards God. Salieri's desire to get rid of him is seemingly boundless as he plots and schemes for Mozart's demise. It is no wonder why Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, with 5-Star performances by F. Murry Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart. Amadeus is an emotionally charged and tragic piece, a story of the life of one of the world's most famous composers, as seen through the eyes of his worst enemy."
AnActorExplains,"Mar 9, 2025",9/10,"Amadeus was written by the wonderful playwright Peter Shaffer, who I met in Manhattan as an acting student. A kind and charming old man, he was moved to tears by the then premiere of his niece's play. Shaffer's works involve a great deal of practical dialogue, and we often cold read them to each other in class. The success of Amadeus onstage lead to the film adaptation; an enduring production criticized for its historical inaccuracies. It's true that this film takes liberties with what we know of Mozart, but I believe that creativity enriches the movie, especially since we're informed this is fiction.Amadeus's introduction oozes character and vulnerability, quickly enchanting the viewer. F. Murray Abraham is completely invested in his part, and the passion with which he works is inspiring. Tom Hulce devised his character's unusual laugh, which you will hear in the film. His portrayal is boisterous and energetic! In order to trigger genuine feelings in an audience, an actor must honestly live the script's moments as if they were his own genuine experiences. While watching this film, notice how natural the actors appear: their poses are ordinary and their gestures mundane. You can recognize their feelings because they aren't embellishing.Every aspect of this film is peak cinema and among the highest quality that Hollywood achieves. The acting, at times, may feel very eighties, due to lack of European accents and the American ensemble. This is, however, a small defect in an otherwise flawless film. Amadeus teaches us how love becomes envy due to wounded pride, how we often see others as a threat, and how very destructive we can be to each other. Winner of endless accolades and eight Academy awards, Amadeus is essential cinema and a timeless classic."
varundelpiero,"Nov 3, 2008",8/10,"For all intents and purposes, I have split this review/comment into two portions, namely the subjective and the objective.Let's begin with the subjective: I personally don't like musicals on the Silver Screen; they just don't work for me (I said the same thing about CHICAGO). And while I agree that this is not a musical per se, it does feature a lot of overly dramatic operatic pieces/plays, which brings me to my second point: I don't like opera. Maybe it's just me, but I just can't get into it no matter how hard I try. Thirdly, I'm not necessarily fond of period pieces, and have only liked a handful of movies of this type (most notably BARRY LYNDON and ATONEMENT). As such, I really did not appreciate this movie as much as I probably should have.Now onto the objective: The acting by F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce is simply extraordinary. Abraham (as Salieri) presents a character who is conflicted and troubled upon meeting Mozart, not necessarily because he hates him, but because he believes that God is teasing or mocking him by placing such musical genius into the hands of a disrespectful, idle, and roguish youth, while seemingly giving the pious Salieri nothing more than mediocrity. As such, Salieri is decidedly presented as the 'reluctant' villain whose guilt and jealousy and sense of divine betrayal constantly eat away at his conscience. The conflict faced by Abraham's character is evident in every scene in which he appears. Tom Hulce presents the prodigy Mozart as somewhat of a modern day 'rock star', living a reckless and carefree existence. It is a bit unfortunate that he had to contend with Abraham for the Best Actor nod, since it was a battle that he was never going to win.Biopics about artists are generally long and boring and do not succeed in connecting with the audience. This is where AMADEUS proves itself to be exceptional; it is not really a biopic and is in fact more of a story than a documentary, as Milos Forman and Frank Shaffer took some liberties with the storyline, resulting in a quite compelling story.Then there's the Music. I mentioned earlier that I am not a fan of musicals, but that doesn't mean that I am opposed to Music in Motion Pictures. On the contrary. I was quite curious to see how Mozart's music would fit into this film, and the end result was simply breathtaking. The musical pieces are not inserted at random in the film as I feared; instead each featured piece succeeds brilliantly in capturing and enhancing the overall mood evoked, and it is evident that much forethought went into the music selection.A final note about the title 'AMADEUS': this film could have been called 'MOZART' or 'WOLFGANG' or anything else that would indicate that the film is indeed about the legendary composer (as not many people knew that Amadeus was his middle name). Any student of language will know that 'Amadeus' loosely translates to 'Loved by God', and it is this concept that drives the film, as Salieri believes that God has forsaken him by blessing Mozart with the musical talents which Salieri believes he himself should have had. It is the resulting bitterness and jealousy that propel the story.This is a great movie overall, and a wonderful character study. It deserved the Best Picture and Best Director (a second for Forman after ONE FLEW OVER THE CUCKOO'S NEST) Oscars in a relatively weak field that year (1984). Nonetheless, it is just not my type of movie and I find it difficult to give this movie more that 8/10 since it would seem that I am bending to the will of other critics, influenced by the 'popular' vote rather than my own. I give this film 3.5 stars (out of 4) since I believe that as an Oscar winner it should be seen and studied. This film will garner a spot on my 'Honourable Mentions' list due to the superb acting, direction, storyline, and music, rather than to the overdone and seemingly never-ending operatic segments. Highly recommended."
Gerald-5,"Feb 26, 2003",10/10,"When I first saw this film I voted 9 as I wasn't 1000% smitten by it. But I have just seen it again and consider it one of my favourite films of all time. A feast for the ears and eyes. Mozart's music is, of course, incomparable. For a purists, not doubt, the speech-over some of the music would be annoying, but I found the soto voce comments helped to make sense of the pieces and to combine them into an integral part of the whole film."
pelicans_and_such,"Oct 30, 2004",10/10,"I've just acquired a video of ""Amadeus,"" and I have a much greater appreciation for it now than I did when I saw it six years ago. I was filled with the urge to see it after watching ""The Hunchback of Notre Dame"" repeatedly, which stars Tom Hulce as the voice of Quasimodo. Yet, as I watched ""Amadeus,"" though Tom Hulce was exceptional as Mozart, it was F. Murray Abraham with whom I was most impressed. He is PERFECT as Salieri, and he does one of the best acting jobs I have ever seen in my life in this part. He plays his character in such a real and believable way that I was completely taken in by him. Also, so great is his talent, that it took me about five times of watching the movie all the way through (and checking the credits!) to realize that it was the same actor playing ""Old Salieri"" and ""Middle-aged Salieri"" throughout the movie. I recommend that you see this movie just of Abraham alone, though the entire thing is a masterpiece. I went out and bought a cd of Mozart's Requiem Mass after seeing it just twice! Overall, this movie is intriguing and entertaining, and the actors are perfect. No one could have played Mozart better than Tom Hulce, and I don't think I have to mention how amazing F. Murray Abraham is as Salieri again. I give it a 10/10. Simply fantastic."

The picture contains some striking visual images , lavish setting with enormous production design by Patrizia Von Brandenstein , terrific period piece with realistic scenario for the XVIII century filmed on location in Prague, besides nifty brilliant costumes . In fact , Prague , Milos Forman's native city, was ideal as a stand-in for Vienna , as modern television antennas, plastic and asphalt had rarely been introduced under Communist rule . This is an agreeable rendition by playwright Peter Shaffer of his play about the dramatic rivalry among two great composers . Tom Hulce delivers a stunning portrayal, a boorish musician kissed with genius , sometimes a little bit exaggerated, of the popular composer whose music is become immortal. Hulce expresses musical genius and a first class finger-matching . Tom Hulce practiced four hours a day at the piano to appear convincing . Salieri is performed in masterly style throughout by F. Murray Abraham , winning deservedly one of the movie's Oscars , conveying inner feeling by looks , movements and gestures .Evocative and colorful cinematography by Miroslav Ondricek .

Prince-P,"Jun 15, 2024",7/10,"Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was only 35 years old when he passed away. Despite his short life he managed to write over 800 pieces of music in various genres. Works of such melodic beauty and sweeping elegance that Mozart is widely regarded as one of the greatest composers the world has ever seen (or heard). But his greatness also angered many contemporary musicians. Upon Mozart's untimely death, it was rumored that he had been poisoned by his jealous colleague, Antonio Salieri. An accusation that will probably never be proven.These dramatic events were depicted in Peter Schaffer's famous play ""Amadeus"". The year was 1979, and the piece was a big hit on Broadway and in the West End of London. Consequently, no one was surprised when Hollywood a few years later acquired the movie rights. Milos Forman was to direct, but first he wanted to do some rewriting with Peter Schaffer. After six months, and countless, bitter arguments, the two men were barely on speaking terms anymore.Casting ""Amadeus"" turned out to be just as difficult. Every leading star in Tinseltown was interested in the two main parts, but Forman wanted unknown talents in the roles. So, the studio had to hold thousands of auditions before settling on Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham as Mozart and Salieri. The world-renowned Sir Neville Marriner then agreed to conduct the score on the condition that not a single note of Mozart's original music was changed.Against all odds, ""Amadeus"" was a big public success. And at the Academy Awards the following year, the film was nominated for a total of eleven Oscars. Milos Forman's beautiful period piece won in the categories Best Picture, Best Directing, Best Leading Actor and Best Writing. But the picture also had an ironic aftermath. The modestly talented composer Antonio Salieri, whose music had been forgotten for so many years, suddenly began to be played again."
claudio_carvalho,"Oct 18, 2003",10/10,"Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham, in an outstanding performance), the Vienna court's composer, is in the end of his life in an asylum. He receives the visit of a priest and tell him how he destroyed Mozart (the actor who has disappeared from the screens Tom Hulce, also in a marvelous performance). Then, the story of Mozart, through the jealousy and admiration of Salieri, is told to the viewers in a spectacular movie. The performances of the cast, the direction, soundtrack, costumes and photography are wonderful. A curiosity: Cynthia Nixon (Miranda, from Sex and the City) has a small, but relevant participation in this movie as the servant Lorl. A movie to be watched many times. The viewers who appreciate excellent movies and classic music will certainly love it. My vote is ten."
Seraphion,"Jan 28, 2015",7/10,"The movie successfully surprised me with its depiction of Mozart's character and of how he lived his life. But the movie also did very well in depicting the genius of Mozart. I also like how the movie integrate the music into the whole picture, especially on the music writing scene later on. The perspective in the story-telling is also a very nice aspect of this movie. By using Salieri's view of Mozart, the movie nicely confirms the adagio of a hater is indeed a true lover. Especially in this case, the hater is someone who also has quite a talent though not equaling Mozart himself. F. Murray Abraham nicely portray the old Salieri very well, projecting the amazement, hate, guilt and envy all at once. Tom Hulce quite successfully depict his role with the stupid maniacal laughter."
flackjacket,"Mar 26, 2015",1/10,"Wow. I've just read dozens of pages of rave reviews about how this movie was awesome, the best, amazing, and yes, even incredible. Are you serious? Most likely this is because they were no doubt impressed by the score which featured masterworks by one of the greatest musical geniuses in all of history. Or, perhaps this was their first exposure to music of this caliber.But to anyone who knows the real historic truth about Mozart, these raving positive reviews are the equivalent of these uniformed reviewers wearing a t-shirt that says in big bold letters: ""I know absolutely nothing about music history"".Of course, any complete novice of classical music would be impressed by a totally fictional and insulting movie about Mozart simply because of the music. And the obvious fact, they don't realize that what they are watching is pure fiction, ignorant to that it is revisionist history, and to anyone who knows who Mozart really was, an offensive insult.In reality it's a film that exploits Mozart's music in order to win over the uninformed, and then proceeds to fill their heads with a mockery of who the man really was. The result is the masses, who know nothing about Mozart, go away impressed by his music but believing a fictional mockery as the truth. It uses his creative works to perpetuate a mockery of the genius who composed them. Sad, really sad."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 29, 2015",N/A,"a beautiful film. in special manner because not the historical accuracy , not the subject itself are the pillars but a precise web of music, acting, locations. it is not a film about Mozart but about the force of genius. and admirable job of a great director who propose a story in which each detail becomes significant. not a competition between composers but the desire to understand. not only a great show but an inspired one. because the viewer is part of it. because the build of Requiem has the force to create to public special emotions. again and again. because not the names are important, not the old story by Pushkin who is the roots of play is important but the magnificent art to transform it in a memorable film who use each possibility of the play recreating a period and its characters. Tom Hulce is one of many Mozarts who could be imagine. but he has the inspiration to give an unique version, different by real person but more than a character. F. Murray Abraham is Salieri in a fascinating manner. vulnerable and cruel, fragile and dark. a film who must see. for its extraordinary magic."
clangfield,"Jan 16, 2004",9/10,"If you want to learn how to act, watch F Murray Abraham in Amadeus. You could not see a better exposition of the art of acting. Every gesture, expression and movement conveys his emotions in infinite detail. You know exactly what's going through his mind, and why. Tom Hulce gives a very good performance, but Abraham is exceptional throughout, and well deserved the Oscar.The only downside to this film is the director's cut edition - the additional scenes spoil the original thrust of the film, and lengthen it unnecessarily. For preference see the theatrical release."
Chuck-149,"Sep 10, 1999",10/10,"If you look back at Forman's passed movies, you think essentially of one of them, that movie being the all-time classic ""One flew over the cuckoo's nest"".  But you can't overlook his second masterpiece, ""Amadeus"".  Although not quite as excellent as his previous classic, Forman's tale of jealousy and tragedy plays out as well as it could have.  Plus, a terrific performance by F. Murray Abraham and a terrific script kept the movie as good as it could be for its complete running-time.The movie's opening scene consists in the camera filming two servants running over to their master's room whom we hear yelling.  After they break into the room they realize that their master, Antonio Salieri (Abraham), has tried to commit suicide for his neck is slit.  However, he is saved just on time and taken to a hospital where a priest comes to see him offering him forgiveness.  However, Salieri uses the priest as a witness to his tale of the murder of Amadeus (Tom Hulce).The movie shows all the facts that made Salieri hate Amadeus all the more as well as the trouble Amadeus could get into and his difficulty to make end's meet also.  You finally see how Amadeus dies, according to Forman naturally, and why Salieri blames himself for the murder of the composer.Between the directing, the acting, the script, and the costumes, there isn't much Forman doesn't include.  Of course, the music is better than in probably any other movie.  But I think that what impressed me the most about this movie is Abraham's truely beautiful, convincing performance.  It's a shame he hasn't played in any other great movies since because he is a tremendous actor.  But the bottom line for this movie is this: See it."
SlicerX,"Feb 25, 2003",10/10,"Look, I will make this simple. It is probably the best acted film I have ever seen especially by Abraham F Murray. I think the script is incredible, although it really has nothing to do with the real life of Mozart. The music is by the greatest of all composers, Mozart, so to say that the score is the best is an understatement."
enmussak,"Dec 16, 2002",10/10,"I grew up with this movie because my father watched all the time.  Only when I got older did I realize its brilliance.  Salieri is one of my favorites in film history.  How often do you get that deep into the psyche of a character?  That level of character development gives the viewer an interpretation for EVERY look on F. Murray Abraham's face, and not to mention, an intense connection with the story.  After all, this is Salieri's movie, not Mozart's.This film is packed with movie moments that grip you, and most of them involve scenes showcasing Mozart's music.  I am so happy that Mozart's beautiful catalog of music is associated with this top-notch film, even though the story is fictional.  However, you know that there was at least one composer who recognized Mozart's pure genius, and professional envy is a common vice.  Salieri represents a mind-blowing glimpse into how jealousy can tear a man to shreds.    Film simply does not get much better than Amadeus.  ""And then... an oboe.""  10/10 ****"
NaplesMacMan,"May 21, 2004",10/10,"Yes, Amadeus is funny, sad, musical, romantic, and even sexy; but its real value (IMHO) lies in what we can learn from it about the creative temperament. Great artists (sadly) usually ARE impulsive, hyper-sensitive, self-indulgent, non-conformists who are often also self- destructive. Amadeus can easily be viewed as a tragic-comic essay on the artistic personality in general. It was this focus that made it such a valuable learning experience for me. It will remain on my personal top ten list of rewarding film experiences."
rbsjrx,"Aug 25, 2004",8/10,"After not having seen ""Amadeus"" for many years, I impulsively bought the director's cut edition which was on sale at the local wholesale club. It is everything I remember about it.First the good...The score is wonderful! As noted in the bonus materials, the music - all Mozart's and not adapted - actually becomes another character in the movie. It's glorious! Milos Forman also made the conscious decision to use a variety of Mozart's music and not just a few familiar pieces and it adds immeasurably to the enjoyment of the movie. Of course, the other can work well as well - e.g. ""Elvira Madigan"", where Mozart's 21st piano concerto became ""the Elvira Madigan theme"".The direction and cinematography are gorgeous and impeccable. This is a beautifully-crafted film which invokes a great sense of time and place.Now for the bad...The myth of Salieri's murder or attempted murder has been around since the time of Mozart. It's the sort of juicy story that just develops a life of its own, despite all evidence to the contrary. It's unfortunate that it has been perpetuated by so many - from Mozart's time to Pushkin to Shaffer. TheMozart's portrayal as childish and vulgar is inaccurate. He had a sense of humor and fun. Sometimes his sense of humor was vulgar in interaction with those closest to him, but he certainly knew how to conduct himself as a professional in public. In the movie, he is depicted as both immoral and an alcoholic toward the end of his life. Affairs have been speculated, but almost anyone who draws public attention has to endure such speculation, true or not. In Mozart's case, there is no serious evidence to back up the gossip. Certainly, he was not a drunkard! Also, although he was certainly not wise in his handling of his financial affairs, he was just as surely not without students and lived quite comfortably for most of his adult life.Salieri's portrayal as a mediocre composer is also wrong. Salieri was certainly in the shadow of Mozart, but he was a talented composer of mostly operas (unlike Mozart, Salieri rarely composed instrumental music). Had Mozart not lived at the same time, Salieri would certainly have been better known, but then the same could be said of almost every contemporary composer. It's worth noting that Salieri's students included Beethoven and Liszt.Costanze's portrayal is closer to the truth, but still misses the mark. By all accounts, she was a devoted wife and Mozart was devoted to her. She certainly did not leave for ""the spa"" when he was sick. The backstory of her as the daughter of Mozart's landlady ignores the fact that she was the younger sister of a girl Mozart had wanted to marry when he and his mother were in Paris. The older sister eventually became famous as a prima donna and spurned him. Mozart remained in good terms with the family and was boarding with them in Vienna when he and Costantze developed into a couple. Leopold Mozart was opposed to the marriage mostly because the family had a reputation for what we would call a Bohemian lifestyle.Leopold Mozart's portrayal is more accurate, but then his isn't a fleshed-out character in the show. Leopold's relationship with his son was complex and, after the death of Mozart's mother, increasingly strained. The motives imputed to him by the script are not only wrong, but over-simplified. One thing we do know for sure is that it was not Salieri that commissioned the requiem mass. Count Walsegg-Stuppach was the mysterious ""man in gray"" who intended to pass the work off as his own.While I enjoyed the movie enough to give it an 8 rating, it's unconscionable to think that many people may accept its slanders as truth."
AbhiMathews,"Jan 4, 2015",7/10,"Perfection is a feat often sought but rarely attained (perhaps never, some say).Antonio Salieri, the man who never was Mozart, recounts his life and the great influence this peculiar man named Amadeus had on his entirety. From Salieri's outlandish dreams to royal career, Mozart's ingenuity eluded him and he could never quite figure out ""how?""For such an eventful and studied life, Mozart certainly endured a lot despite having all the talent in the world. Skill was never a question, but showcasing and having others comprehend his beauty at the time often was. Salieri, despite his best (and vile) efforts, never approaches the perfection Mozart produced at a whim. To create perfection so easily is the great struggle that haunts him to this day.But maybe perfection is never truly the goal.This extraordinary biopic is as entertaining as they come. Whether for the great score, pleasant acting or overall story that will live forever, Amadeus is certainly a tale to tell."
michadny,"Oct 25, 2015",9/10,"Amadeus is probably the most exciting film about classical music and Mozart ever. It's so wonderfully filmed in such an extravagant way, from the costumes to the set designs to the glorious music that plays from scene to scene. It may possibly be the best biographical interpretation of any person, as the film becomes alive with fun, joy and fantastical persona's.Mozart may well be the most iconic film about any musician. The acting is phenomenal, and Mozart's laugh is something that carries this dialogue heavy film through. Despite Mozart's childish behavior, you always want him to be on screen. Though the film is long, especially the director's cut, Amadeus is a fantastic film that will always go down in history as one of the greats."
saadanathan,"May 28, 2022",7/10,"""Amadeus"" is one of those grand, big and ambitious movies with a huge display of talent and.... well you see? Now I feel like the king in the movie. I'm lost of words. As it is the first time I've seen this movie, I don't quite know what to say. I don't have anything negative to say about the film, on the other hand I'm not sure what else to say about it.I guess two aspects of the film that I enjoyed were the music (obviously) and the costume design. Both of them were amazing and I enjoyed their presence. The music of course belongs to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and every piece of it is beautiful and marvelous. The costume design was also extraordinary and caught me by surprise a bit of how ridiculously giant those outfits were back then. It helped me feel the vibes of the time.The rivalry between Mozart and Saliery was nicely portrayed. Showing Saliery's envy towards Mozart. Even though Mozart felt no rivalry he was a showoff in most cases.Overall I really enjoyed the joy and emotions portrayed in the movie, with such a sad ending for both characters. This movie is well recommended for those who love classic music or music in general."
maniuis,"Jun 27, 2011",5/10,"I have been reading some of the reviews of the IMDb ""critics""... for God's sake! Did these people even bother to watch the movie? Also I am very shocked to see this movie has got an over 8 rating. This is a very boring title. The only good thing about the film is the score -well, it had to be given that it was mostly written by a W.A. Mozart...Other than that, this movie is a simple waste of time. The acting is awful and the guy who portrays the legendary music genius should be in a circus. F. Murray does a nice job acting but he is the only one. Too bad the man who wrote the script did not know what he was doing.I wonder if people who ""admire"" this movie do so because of the movie itself or because of the real Mozart and his heavenly music.Go rent Kung Fu Panda and enjoy a truly good movie."
ovidkeii22,"Nov 23, 2024",10/10,"Mozart is played by young Tom Hulce and in one of the few times that two actors from the same film got nominated in the same acting category, Hulce and Abraham were both up for Best Actor and Abraham won as opposed to both of them canceling each other out. It really would be hard to live on the difference in their performances, without a good Mozart and an equally good Salieri, the film would not be the masterpiece it is.And it did win for Best Picture, Best Director for Milos Forman and a flock of other Oscars, all well deserved. Besides those already mentioned I think you will enjoy Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's long suffering wife and Roy Dotrice as his more staid and settled father who can't cope with a mercurial genius of a son any better than Abraham can."
footballer239,"May 19, 2009",8/10,"""Amadeus"" was a historical biography about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The movie opens with an old man in a wheelchair, whispering Italian. This man, Saleri, plays a key character. Saleri plays as the narrator for some parts in which he is telling about his past and being with Mozart. He then has flashbacks of when he was a court composer and Mozart was just in his youth. Saleri was in love with the music that came from Mozart and was somehow always around Mozart when he had come up with new music. Saleri, himself, being so intrigued with the music and melodies, came up with his own composure's to try and please the Emperor. The Emperor is pleased, however, has Amadeus play it and while doing so, he changes a few keys here and there. This made Saleri upset because Amadeus did this quite often and leads us to believe that Saleri should've been the ""real celebrity."" A lot of Mozarts ideas are inspired by Saleri but with no credit given to him. Amadeus is married and has four children but the movie only portrayed one. He is quite the drunk, he spent all his time writing material and the moment he got paid for it, he spends it all on going out and getting drunk. He has the nice house and all, but his only happiness is coming up with music for everyone to hear. Even though this film is historical, I enjoyed the plot. Describing someone's life is definitely not easy, but Peter Shaffer did a great job with coming up with the plots and screen work. And showing the inside drama within each of the leading characters (Amadeus and Saleri) was interesting and led you into each of their lifes. The acting and music was great, I liked that they actually used his own works and used them correctly. The dramatics between roles were extreme but not the point where it was too much. And having Amadeus have a ridiculous laugh made it more enjoyable and more humorous. Some things I think the director should've pushed more for would be a better German accent. These characters seemed to have more of an English talk. The way they made Amadeus seem like nothing more than a drunk, turned me away. In many scenes in which he was coming up with plays, he always had some sort of drink in his hands, making it seem like it was his only getaway. They made Saleri seem more of like the jealous type and that the only thing he was living for was to get revenge on Amadeus, when in fact Saleri was quite the composer himself and is well-known. With the time transition, they should've made the characters age as years went on. Amadeus looked just about the same the whole movie. The choice of the cast was great, to me there were no actors that are too well-known and would be more favorable than others just because of their acting experience. They made acting seem effortless Amadeus is obviously a story about Wolfgang Mozart and his life. its factual, yet comical. The acting is great and holds drama you don't want to miss. If your into music, biographies, good humor, and a man's jealousy, this movie is definitely worth your time. I would rate ""Amadeus,"" by Milos Forman 8 out of 10. Great movie with a killer laugh!!"
kappani7,"Jan 3, 2025",10/10,"The ultimate film about Mozart's life, or at least some moments of it !The first time I saw this film I was focused only on Amadeus, he could easily create a composition from scratch & at the same time have it all in his mind & what a concept of music he had as he could play the composition again with just by hearing it once !The second time I saw the film I focused on Salieri. He felt so small next to the top composer & so unable to reach his potential, that at least in the beginning he created an admiration that he could not control & led him to dark thoughts . .A film dressed in the superb sounds of Mozart & a masterpiece of photography & costumes .The top composer in a top film !"
estebangonzalez10,"Aug 29, 2015",10/10,"""This was no composition by a performing monkey! This was a music I'd never heard. Filled with such longing, such unfulfillable longing, it had me trembling. It seemed to me that I was hearing the voice of God.""As I sat there breathless staring at my screen watching this astounding masterpiece while listening to its amazing soundtrack, I couldn't help but relate to F. Murray Abraham's Salieri in his admiration for Mozart and his genius, although my admiration was geared towards Milos Forman's outstanding direction and not on the actual composer himself. What a unique experience this three hour film was for me. Amadeus was a movie I had been putting off mainly because of its extremely long running time and its subject matter: a biopic about a classical music composer, but what a pleasure it was to finally get to experience it for the first time. My concerns about this film couldn't have been so far off because this was such a rich treasure to discover. Amadeus is a timeless film, directed in 1984, it could just as well have been directed today and you wouldn't notice the difference. Everything from the art direction and the set pieces, to the costumes and makeup, to the cinematography could rival any film released this year. I still can't believe this was made in 1984 because it is better than most biopics made today. Just as the central figure of this movie was such a creative and talented composer, Forman proved once again to be way ahead of his peers and was a prodigy director during the 80's. I thought there was no way he could top his marvelous work in One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest, but he just did. To say this is one of the biopics ever made is an understatement, because it is one of the best films period. Roger Ebert couldn't have said it better in his review when he wrote, ""the film is constructed in wonderfully well-written and acted scenes -- scenes so carefully constructed, unfolding with such delight, that they play as perfect compositions of words."" Winner of eight Academy Awards including Best Picture, the Oscars oddly awarded the more deserving film that year.Amadeus couldn't have a more suitable and meaningful title, taken from Mozart's middle name which in Latin means ""loved by God,"" the film explores the tormented relationship he had with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), the court composer of Austrian Emperor, Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). Salieri was so passionate about music that he begged God to make him the best composer the world had known by promising to remain chaste and devoted to Him. We learn this during a confession he is giving to Father Vogler (Richard Frank) after having attempted to commit suicide and confessing to being responsible of Mozart's death decades ago. The film is told in flashback as Salieri narrates what an impression Mozart had made in Vienna during his youth. He was eager to meet this prodigy who God had blessed with such an immense and unique talent, but when Mozart (Tom Hulce) is finally invited to perform at the Emperor's court, Salieri is shocked by what he discovers. Mozart is a childish and vulgar fellow with an obscene giggle that only seemed to mock everything he believed about God's immaculate and pure music. Feeling betrayed and confused as to how God could allow this hideous being to be blessed with such an amazing talent, he makes it his personal vendetta to defy God and bury Mozart's career.The film centers on themes of artistic genius and creativity as well as professional jealousy and uncomprehended talent. The universal theme of man against God is also tackled throughout the three hour runtime. These themes are perfectly explored and balanced with comedic moments scattered throughout, which allow the pacing of the film to move at a pleasant beat. Very seldom do you find such a perfectly balanced biopic that manages to remain comic and tragic at the same time. Some of the success of Amadeus must be attributed to the gorgeous location in which the movie was filmed. Choosing Prague to depict the mid 1700's Vienna was a perfect choice and the stages where the Opera scenes where performed were simply mesmerizing. Forman also allowed his actors to retain their American accents which was another intelligent choice. There is no need to give the actors silly English European accents if you are going to have them speak in any other language other than the original. The screenplay adaptation of Peter Shaffer's Award winning stage play was also a hit because the dialogue in this film is truly inspiring and I can recall several great quotes from it.The two lead performances in Amadeus are incredibly powerful. F. Murray Abraham took home the Oscar for best lead actor and he will forever be remembered for his role here as the frustrated and jealous Salieri. The inner conflict he experiences as he easily goes from admiration and bewilderment to hatred and jealousy while listening to each composition is outstanding. Tom Hulce is just as great playing the titular character. Never in a million years would I have cast him in a role like this, but it only added to the underlying theme of looks and talents not always going well together. Hulce's cheerful and giggly demeanor slowly grows on the audience as he is first presented as an irritating figure, but gradually begins to appear more sympathetic, and our initial alliances with Salieri begin to turn while he grows darker. I could go on writing about this amazing film, but I feel no matter what I have to say about it, it's simply going to be another mediocre review of an incredibly masterful film. There are no words that can justly describe this film, so by all means if you haven't seen this masterpiece go check it out.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
Conerstevens,"Oct 8, 2021",6/10,"Honestly are people reviewing Mozart himself or this movie? I can't figure any other reason it gets an 88/100.I've never watched a movie where I cared less about any of the characters. None of them seem remotely recognizable as human beings despite taking the liberties with historical inaccuracies.Most disappointing is that for a movie about one of the greatest composers of all time the audio is a big let down. It's just a seemingly random order nonstop soundtrack that feels flat. I'm still waiting for that moment that would make the hair on my neck stand up.Can't quite put my finger on why all the opera scenes felt completely unrealistic but I did notice the lip syncing is awful, and the sets look like they are all made of styrofoam at a local high school.Someone needs to make a good movie about a classical composer so everyone can come to their senses as to how mediocre this is."
denizkilc,"Nov 28, 2024",9/10,"Amadeus is a cinematic masterpiece that orchestrates the complex interplay of genius, envy, and humanity with unparalleled finesse. Set against the lush backdrop of 18th-century Vienna, the film transcends its period drama trappings, becoming a universal exploration of creativity and ambition.What makes Amadeus extraordinary is its ability to celebrate the beauty of Mozart's music while unraveling the fragile, flawed humans behind the genius. The performances are magnetic, each layered with emotion and nuance, drawing viewers into an operatic tapestry of triumph and tragedy.The film's visual and auditory elements are nothing short of sublime, with stunning cinematography and a soundtrack that feels like a character in its own right. Amadeus doesn't just tell a story-it immerses you in an experience, leaving you in awe of the heights and depths of the human spirit. An opus for the ages."
fishermensmell,"Feb 1, 2021",6/10,"Aware of this film's stature, upon my first view in 2021 (the Director's Cut) I have to say I am quite disappointed. It's by no means bad, but not the masterpiece I was expecting.As many reviewers have noted, this is not a film about Amadeus and should not be considered a biopic. Rather it takes the already dramatized relationship between Amadeus and supposed court ""rival"" Salieri and uses this as a platform to explore one man's drive for excellence. So, akin to films like 'Whiplash' and 'Shine' that see obsessed musicians collapsing under their pursuit of perfection, this films looks at Salieri and his actions following the crushing realisation that he is not in the same league as Amadeus, and his seeming rejection/betrayal by God. To that end, we see Salieri double down on his godlessness and bitter envy, mounting a campaign to craftily manipulate those around him to bring about the slow tortuous downfall of Amadeus: however, all of this is narrated by Salieri himself from a sanatorium, well established as an unrealiable narrator steeped in guilt. The film never really quite gets under his skin and so we are left with little additional insight into what drives his jealousy to such great heights and the whole film plays rather like a lavish soap opera.As a period piece, it doesn't strive for authenticity (just 5 minutes of dialogue, American accents and the frat-house dynamic of the king's court are enough to establish this) but it does pull out all the stops in terms of style and visual sumptuousness.All-in-all, I was entertained throughout the 3 hours, which is an achievement for any director, but the experience was much like eating a Ferrero Rocher: it looks sophisticated, but really it's just being made in a factory with all the other Mars Bars, Twixes and Double Deckers. It's enjoyable while it lasts, but offers little in lasting nourishment."
cmcole,"Nov 17, 2004",N/A,"I'm writing this more than anything as a response to the comments about Tom Hulce's accent, the use of English, etc.1. As was already mentioned by another post, the English is used every time the characters ""should"" be speaking German, and so it was done in the songs as well.2. As for the accent, I don't see why this is such an issue. The American accent is a dialect of English spoken in North America, granted. But who cares? That doesn't make Mozart sound any less European. With an English accent, I argue that he'd sound no more Austrian. It's well-known that the characters in this movie, although all speaking German, should represent a huge variety of dialects and accents, not least of which would be Salieri's, who, lest we forget, was an Italian.Other than that, I think the film is outstanding. Yes, I realize there are plenty of historical inaccuracies, but why is that a problem? It isn't a history presentation, it's a movie."
robprum,"Oct 13, 2024",9/10,"I have seen this movie several times. In the cinema and on TV. Each time part of the original movie was cut away... therefore the sudden disgrace that befell Mozart in Vienna became incomprehensable.The scene where he took too many liberties with a student is often ommitted...There is a gaffe that will only be noticed by collectors of orders and medals. In that amusing scene where Mozart improvises a march on a theme by Sallieri the emperor wears his breast star of the Maria Theresia Order upside down! In other scenes the star is worn in the correct way. It is clearly seen in the stills on Google.Otherwise a feast for eye and ear, allthough i would have preferred all the opera music in German or italian. That was how Mozart performed his operas, not in English!Robert Prummel Groningen The Nethetlands."
oswaldochavez-59807,"Feb 27, 2025",10/10,"Milos Foreman's master piece-the acting, the music, the photography, the production -it's flawless. The music curation and visual representation of Mozart's work is sensational. If you are not familiar with Mozart's legacy you might find it a bit tedious otherwise it'll transport you to that musical golden era in Vienna to get a sense of the life and struggles of the greatest composer whom ever existed. Although historically the facts are not accurate, the plot and drama match perfectly to make it one of the best movies ever made -a mandatory must watch in the top 10 of films ever made. You might unfairly end up hating Salieri after watching it."
diac228,"Sep 30, 2008",10/10,"While 1984 box-office-wise was dominated by Beverly Hills Cop and Ghostbusters, there is one film that rises above them all in terms of quality by miles upon miles. Amadeus is an excellent and superbly-crafted film that is most likely the greatest stage-to-film translation in the history of film-making. Combining exotic and fascinating sets with great cinematography, flawless acting, grand writing, great directing, and a well-picked soundtrack to blend it all together, Amadeus is a visual treat full of deep themes that will move and question your soul. The effort involved is most likely the reason why mainstream audiences believed that everything that happened in the film actually happened, when in fact it's based off of a popular play. In this tale about religion, greed, envy, music, passion, and love, there is an overwhelming amount of material presented in its above-average running time. Calling this the best movie of 1984 and one of the better movies of the 1980s isn't a stretch at all.Amadeus starts off with an elderly and bitter Antonio Salieri reaching a low point in his depression by attempting to kill himself. He then confesses to a priest his story about his life involving Mozart, and the film enters a flashback mode that jumps between the past and present; the present in the movie is merely Salieri evaluating the events that were going on. The majority of Amadeus is about Salieri as he struggles to find peace with himself and God after witnessing a childish vulgar man deliver some of the best, daring, experimental, and unbelievable music the world had ever laid its ears onmusic that is much better than anything Salieri could produce. Salieri's jealousy and rage gets the better of him as his quest for vengeance and victory spirals out of control at the same time as Mozart's un-expecting depressing spiral. The movie focuses on many themes, with God and religion being the dominant theme.The strongest quality Amadeus possesses is the excellent directing and writing. The writer and creator of the play was involved with the screenplay, and overall its Oscar-worthy material. Stripping the themes and major ideas from the play and turning it into a film-like medium, the movie itself is just as powerful as the stage version. Peter Shaffer's influences include several short stories about Mozart and many rumored tales that Salieri confessed to killing Mozart (which is heavily debated even today). Milos Foreman, known for directing ""One Flew over the Cukoo's Nest,"" is at the top of his game here. We see many sweeping shots of the city streets, beautiful and massive sets for operas, performances, and musicals, and just so much more. It is one thing to have wonderful sets, but it takes a good director to know how to handle the 360 degrees of beauty surrounding the scene. Complimenting the directing is the editing, which apparently didn't win an Oscar. Try naming 10 scenes better-edited than the ""Requiem"" scene towards the end.In a rare double-nomination moment in the Academy, both of the main characters were nominated for best acting, and both of them should have won (instead of just one of them). The acting in Amadeus is nearly flawless, from Tom Hulce as Mozart to F. Murray Abraham as Saliri, to even the smaller roles (See pre-Sex and the City Cynthia Nixon pull a good performance in a minor role). The cast excels the movie into rarely-reached heights, as the opera singers and dancers and performers enhance the authenticity of the period piece and the way the performances were done back in the 18th century/19th century. Even if you aren't a fan of the opera, you can't help but be startled by how long they can cling on to some of those notes.Bottom Line: Stretching this review any longer would be an insult, because it shouldn't require this many words to describe why everyone should see this movie at least once. Amadeus is an excellent movie, no doubt about it. There's too much going for it for you to ever complain about the nitty-gritty details. The only setback is how much fiction is involved, even though some of Mozart's seemingly-exaggerated accomplishments are indeed true (Yes he did write professional music at age 4, yes he used to be able to memorize an entire piece of music after just one listen, and yes he wrote operas at age 7). But forgetting the loose mesh of fact and fiction and you'll find a rich movie full of wonderful music, beautiful scenery, and memorable scenes. Recommend to the highest degree, especially if you are a fan of classical music, or better yet a fan of good movies. Amadeus: One of the shining gems of the 1980s.P.S. Someone come up with a great Beethoven movie, please, he deserves it."
LW-08854,"Jan 14, 2025",8/10,"There's so much to admire in this movie it's hard to know where to begin. The art design, music, costumes, performances and editing are all at fantastic, it's the combination of these elements with such a fascinating plot and themes which elevate the film to such a high level. I was honestly captivated and completely absorbed by the story. The film manages to slightly modernise some aspects to give it a more immediate feel I felt such as in the dialogue. If I have any criticism it's that the film slightly runs out of steam just towards the end and I also enjoyed this part of the movie slightly yes. Nevertheless this is a film which demands to been seen and one you can't really remain indifferent to."
ASuiGeneris,"Dec 19, 2013",6/10,"""Amadeus"" is one artist's approach to solving the many mysteries of young Mozart's life, including the now-mythologized circumstances surrounding his early death at the age of thirty-five.Interestingly enough, the film was more of a character study on Salieri, a Composer to Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones). The film opens with Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in an asylum after attempting suicide, asking for forgiveness for murdering Mozart (Tom Hulce) in 1791. His story; his confession; this film, is told to a priest by the name of Father Vogler (Richard Frank). ""Amadeus"" takes place primarily in Vienna, from 1781 until 1791, when Mozart dies. Through Salieri's words, we are able to see Mozart as he is (supposedly) when away from public eye, and the picture is less than ideal. Mozart, although still an undeniable genius and musical prodigy, is also immature, rude, selfish, and has no respect for his wife, children, family, nor anyone else in society.It goes without saying that the accompanying music is phenomenal. Mozart' compositions are essential and forefront enough throughout the entirety of the film to be considered a character. The costume design, period production, mise en scene, etc. was all exceptional. However, I could hardly watch the film because of Mozart's character. Especially his laugh. To make this worse was the fact that this was all in the director/writer's imagination. Yes, this is historical fiction. And I understand that not all facts portrayed in the film need to be historically accurate. However, although this has been perfectly fine for me in other films, in this film, it simply did not work. I really wanted to like this film, I did. But I could not. I had to force myself to watch most of the scenes, saved purely by beautiful costumes and melodious compositions. I found myself hating Mozart, but why? I should rather hate the Mozart this film has created!As I said, thankfully this was more Salieri's than Mozart's plot, and Salieri, although far from lovable, was a watchable and complex character. Although he idolizes Mozart's genius, he hates his character, and struggles with this up to the very last moment. And, really, that is precisely how I felt."
errollgarnier,"Apr 2, 2010",10/10,"If cinema lasts another thousand years, men shall still regard this as its finest hour. Never before have such beautiful words been written about music - whether in film or academia - as Peter Shaffer's exquisite script. Each line is chiselled into perfection. Each scene is contoured with such mastery that it could stand in isolation. F Murray Abraham's embittered snarling Salieri is, simply, one of the greatest portrayals in cinematic history.The film matches the beauty of Mozart's music, which in itself is sublime on a scale never heard before or since, even when one considers the new Ndubz release of beatbox mastermixes. When lazy ignorant musical journalists compare the modern day chart toppers to the Classical giants, Amadeus reminds us that the majority of the new breed are music illiterates. Mozart's genius and insatiable desire to achieve perfection reminds us that for all the advances in the modern world, we must truly humble ourselves to the towering achievements of our artistic ancestors."
jmhinds,"May 19, 2009",7/10,"Amadeus is a movie on the life of the legendary composer Wolfgang Mozart. From a very young age Mozart has had a gifted ear for quality music. Among other things Mozart carried a horrible attitude toward anyone who tried to counsel him. He was very immature, and irresponsible in a number of ways. He had many adoring fans but the fame and attention goes straight to his head. Not even the kind words of his lovely wife could take him off of his high horse.From the very beginning of the movie, Mozart was shown as a very childish young man. Not only was he childish, but he was also disrespectful. There was no one above him as far as people to respect. His father tries to steer him in the right direction but goes with no success. After being banished from his original home he seeks redemption in a new country. He goes to try and conquer another city with his remarkable musical talents.The film itself was well written and well executed. The music was good and the majority of the actors fit their roles very well. Costumes and makeup were perfect; they really did a great job of giving you an idea of what people looked like in those days. The overkill wigs and the extreme dresses put me in the mind set so I could better understand the setting.The major cause for my overall dislike of his movie was the character Wolfgang Mozart. The fact that Mozart was so obnoxious and immature made me happy to see the conclusion. His humor was never funny, his laugh was brain wracking, and his arrogance was angering. The only thing good about Mozart was his ability to crate music. I have no sympathy for people with his character.For people who are interested in the life of a legend this would be a great movie. The director got the story right. The actors brought out the characters very well. The character Salieri was played very well. For the most part his is an overall good movie. I would rate it 4 out of 5. My personal opinion toward it is skewed off of my strong dislike for the character Mozart. Not everyone else may feel as strongly as I do but the movie itself was impressive."
chrismrrw,"May 8, 2013",2/10,"I'll keep it short as others have covered this travesty adequately, I think.Basically, take one of the most talented composers / musicians to have ever lived, make him come across as a complete bumbling idiot with a very annoying and persistent laugh, and that just about covers the central problems with this film, plot aside.I love much of Mozart's music and have read a biography about him, and as such I got the impression that I'd like him as a person. This film would've made me dislike him intensely had I not read about him prior. Try watching this film for 10 minutes and not thinking 'what an annoying idiot Mozart is'. He just comes across as somebody who can play and write music, but is pretty much useless at every other facet in life, and is very irritating with it."
Pycs,"Jul 25, 2011",N/A,"How awesome is this movie? It's a visual feast for the eyes, a hilarious comedic effort, with the backdrop to one of the most intriguing plots of all time. In that, 'Amadeus' is a very rare film. A film that contains everything that is enjoyable about watching movies, yet is unlike any movie I've ever seen.The plot? Well, the website sums it up as ' The incredible story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, told in flashback mode by Antonio Salieri - now confined to an insane asylum.' But the story is as much about Mozart (played by Tom Hulce in a career defining performance) as it is about his jealous counterpart, Salieri (A much deserved Best Actor performance by F. Murray Abraham.) The root of his jealously? Mozart's musical talent, which speaks for itself. Salieri can't come to grips as to how this young man, who acts with immense immaturity, has been gifted this extraordinary talent. It's a story every human being should be able to relate to. I mean, who hasn't been envious one time or another? That's what a great film does, takes a richly exotic scenario and applies real world issues to the plot.See this movie if you haven't, I personally guarantee you will be pleased. I know I was. This film deserved every Oscar it was a given (all 8.)"
joshuafagan-64214,"Sep 15, 2015",10/10,"This is a film that tells its story so well that there is no need for another version of it. After seeing this film, I have no desire to see another Mozart film. This one gave me everything I wanted. Such is not to say that another great, original Mozart film could not be made. I have too much trust of the creativity of the human race to not believe that. There is just no purpose in doing so. There does not need to be more LOTR films, there do not need to be more adaptions of To Kill a Mockingbird, and there do not need to be more movies about Mr. Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.If Forman's other great movie, OFOTCN, is a gloriously humanistic and smartly rebellious, if more than slightly manipulative, knife of a movie, this one is an over-the-top, stylistic, creatively- flourishing, operatic broadsword of an epic. This is the kind of movie that is not just made by a the mind of a director but by his very soul. OFOTCN is 'directed by Milos Forman.' Amadeus is a 'Milos Forman film.'The film mostly takes place in late eighteen century Vienna. It centers around the lives of two men; the eponymous Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, played expertly and to an Academy Award nomination by Tom Hulce, and Antonio Salieri, played expertly and to an Academy Award win by F. Murray Abraham. The former is depicted as a boorish brat and playboy who can nonetheless compose some of the finest music ever heard by human ears, the later as his opposite: a dedicated musician who is nonetheless consigned to be 'the patron saint of mediocrity.' We follow Salieri and go through his eternal misery of being one of the few people in the world who can fully appreciate Mozart's talent yet being completely unable to replicate it.Yes, if you check actual historical accounts, Salieri was not as antagonistic towards Mozart as he is in the movie. But that's not the point of cinema, something that a lot of so-called 'movie fans' don't seem to understand. Yes, I respect and am a fan of Schindler's List and the like. But realism and staying true to actual events is about as essential to a successful film as massive car chases.Film is about feel. Film is about emotion. Film is about style. Film is about characters. And in all these respects, this film soars. Watching this film is like being an opera at one of the old opera houses of the Old World. The watcher is taken into a world of magic. Not Harry Potter-style magic; there are no magicians casting spells. And not abstract, surreal magic either; there are no volcanoes erupting out of nowhere and covering the world in stylistic lava.No; this is high-quality stage magic. When I watch this film, I feel like it has gone up to me and said it was going to entertain me like I had never been entertained before and that I had agreed, giving it my time and my imagination, letting it do with them what it pleased.And it never disappoints. You start trusting the film, building a relationship with it. It starts to become that rich, adventurous friend we all wish we had, one who would take you with him on his trips around the world. And though this film is by no means a 'perfect movie' (I hate that term, by the way), it never fails you so egregiously that the trust you have formed with the film is broken.Every part of this film succeeds all the way through, from the acting to the cinematography to the plot to the near-entirely Mozart- composed soundtrack. Like many of Mozart's compositions, it flows so smoothly yet gloriously that you are both dreamily carried along and strikingly aware of the greatness you are witnessing.My favorite of these aspects is the character of Salieri. Though there is no doubt that he is a villain protagonist, he is also one of the most tragic and unique figures of film. His struggle manages to be both operatically grand and deeply personal. I, for one, was impacted by it on a level that most films cannot even comprehend. I think that in a way, we all feel that way about the geniuses we encounter in our lives.And while I chastise movies for fulfilling simple fantasies, I applaud them for creating characters like this, who are in ways personifications of some of our deepest feelings. Though he knows how idiotic the king is for declaring that Mozart uses 'too many notes' (one of my favorite quotes, by the way), he is still wanting the young prodigy to be taken down a peg. He knows that if he had been born with Mozart's gifts, he would have been as famous, if not more famous than his nemesis. But alas, he is not.There is a scene in which an elderly Salieri play some of his compositions and asks if the priest who has come to hear his 'confession' has ever heard of them. He shakes his head 'no.' Then Salieri plays one of Mozart's pieces and the priest instantly recognizes it. Whether you have seen this film or not, there is no doubt that Mozart was on a different level. So, too, is this film."
EijnarAmadeus,"Jul 20, 2009",10/10,"Never before (with the exception of Apocalypse Now) have I watched a film one day, woken up the next with a new, urging interest to watch it again; this happened to me with Milos Forman's brilliant adaption of Peter Shaffer's play, 'Amadeus'. Brilliantly paced the film runs for 180 minutes (Director's Cut version) and is full of detail (you'll never see a film film so exquisitely ornate with fantastical costumes and production design - it's like a baroque twist between Stanley Kubrick's 1975 'Barry Lyndon' and a wildly imaginative ""anything goes"" style), dizzying narrative depths and extravagant cinematic power. The character studies of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) makes both for career-defining performances, the spiraling relationship between them makes for a dynamic pace that keeps upping the drama towards the powerfully dramatic climax. The music of Mozart feels like the final third main character, so beautifully edited to the masterfully shot scenes by Miroslav Ondricek (the elegant gliding through the corridors, the flaring candle-lights, the crane-shots in the opera... it's truly the finest piece of cinematography ever), the film will reveal new artistic elements ""simply"" in its grand beauty. Importantly, the film is not about Mozart, it's about Salieri and his Mozart and his God, and through several viewings it reveals new sides in the tales of greed, guilt and faith, and it's psychological and darkly painted drama simply enhances more and more as years go by."
kareemamgad,"Feb 19, 2025",8/10,"Milos Forman's Amadeus is a lavish and gripping exploration of genius, envy, and artistic legacy. While not strictly historically accurate, the film delivers an emotionally charged and deeply humanized portrayal of Mozart (Tom Hulce) through the envious eyes of Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham).The performances are phenomenal. Hulce's portrayal of Mozart is electrifying-his high-pitched laughter, playful arrogance, and raw musical brilliance make him a captivating presence. However, it's Abraham who steals the show, delivering a masterful performance as Salieri, a man consumed by his admiration and resentment toward Mozart. His internal conflict and quiet suffering give the film its haunting emotional core.The cinematography, production design, and costuming bring 18th-century Vienna to life with stunning authenticity. Every frame is filled with opulence, and the use of Mozart's music throughout is nothing short of breathtaking. The film seamlessly weaves historical drama with an almost operatic sense of tragedy, making it both grand and intimate.While the runtime may feel a bit stretched at times, Amadeus remains an unforgettable experience-an ode to artistic brilliance and the torment of those who recognize greatness yet feel cursed by their own limitations."
flicklover,"Feb 17, 2025",10/10,"Amadeus is the type of film that is not really made these days. A costume drama that is leaving, thrilling, funny and dramatic. It is based on.tbe Broadway musical of the same name written by Peter Shaffer. It was directed by Milos Forman from a script written Peter Shaffer. The film imagines a rivalry between two of Vienna composers of the 18th century. The composers are Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Mozart was a musical prodigy since childhood. Salieri is not nearly as well known. The film focuses mostly on Salieri's professional envy of Mozart's genius. Mozart is played by Tom Hulce. He is great as Mozart. He is funny exentric and troubled as the musical genius. But as great as Hulce is the film belongs to F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. His Salieri is presented as an old man, narrating the film from an insane asylum where he was committed after trying to kill himself. He tells his story to a priest who offers to hear his confession. He tells the story of how much he loved to write music but he felts inferior to Mozart. He's a jealous man..Even though Salieri has a certain amount of professional success he seems to be the only person who can see Mozart's genius. The film is a costume framldrana but, as with many of these types of films it's never boring. The music, the costumes and set design and especially the cinematography in this film are spectacular.It is one of the best films about how music is created.A masterpiece....Grade: A."
dfranzen70,"Feb 26, 2019",6/10,"The long (nearly 3 hours) biopic is good, even very good, but it'd be nothing if not for F. Murray Abraham's amazing performance, just extraordinary. He's worth your time, even if Tom Hulce turns out not to be your cup of tea. F. is so good that even those who don't dig classical music will get into the groove; he's that passionate. The movie's also artfully framed by Forman, with some exquisite cinematography and, of course, compelling music."
Paul-250,"May 3, 1999",7/10,"You do not have to be a lover of Mozart's music to enjoy this film. The circumstances surrounding the composer's death remain a mystery, and it would be a mistake to see the film as a historical account. The achievement of the film lies in the extent to which it enables us to share in the joyful and almost boyish enthusiasm with which Mozart (Tom Hulce) expresses himself through his music, and to marvel at his eternal optimism in the face of constant adversity, much of it caused by his jealous rival Salieri (Murray Abraham). Hulce's performance is wonderfully spontaneous and energetic, with Abraham's appropriately menacing. Not a great film perhaps, but an enormously entertaining one nonetheless."

Libretio,"May 31, 2005",10/10,"AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUTAspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)Sound format: Dolby DigitalMany years after the death of Mozart (Tom Hulce), the aged and embittered court composer Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) relates to a disbelieving priest the story of his obsession with Mozart's musical genius and how it led to jealousy, betrayal, and possibly even murder...Sumptuous evocation of a time and place, using Mozart's glorious music both to propel the story and underline the emotional dynamics of Peter Shaffer's extraordinary script. Based on his well-received stage play, and completely reworked for the screen, AMADEUS (1984) - and its updated version, reviewed here as AMADEUS: DIRECTOR'S CUT, released in 2001 - portrays Mozart's world as a romantic marriage of Royal palaces and candle-lit garrets, populated by eccentric emperors and their devious, toadying lackeys. The composer himself is played by Hulce as a spoiled, egotistical brat who indulges his passion for earthly pleasures with all the enthusiasm he brings to his musical compositions. But the film is anchored by Abraham in an Oscar-winning turn as Mozart's nemesis Salieri, consumed by envy and hatred whilst simultaneously awed by his rival's genius, the genius which Salieri had wished for himself, only to be denied by a mischievous God. The scenes in his asylum cell - where the elder Salieri confesses his 'crime' to a naive priest (Richard Frank) - are a tour de force, played with an intensity that simply burns up the screen. Beautifully designed and photographed, and bolstered by a magnificent supporting cast (including Jeffrey Jones, Simon Callow and Kenneth McMillan in a role completely excised from the original theatrical print), the movie unfolds like an operatic melodrama which builds to a shattering climax, as the two central characters reach an understanding (of sorts) during the writing of Mozart's 'Requiem', only to be divided forever by unexpected tragedy. A masterpiece.The director's cut runs 180 minutes (the original theatrical version ran 160m) and reinstates various bits and pieces which help to clarify a number of crucial plot developments (the antagonism between Salieri and Mozart's wife is more fully explained, for example). Incredibly, the MPAA gave the film an R-rating for a brief sequence in which a female character bares her breasts to the camera! There's nothing here which warrants anything more than a PG-13.NB. The original version was released theatrically in 35mm and 70mm editions, featuring a 6-track Dolby Stereo soundtrack."
jack_malvern,"Aug 26, 2005",10/10,"Amadeus is a wondrous, if factually dubious spectacle, but be careful to watch the original theatrical edition rather than the director's cut. The film critic for the Toronto Globe and Mail said that Amadeus needs an extra 20 minutes running time like the Magic Flute needs a drum solo, and he was right.It is a rare case of film studio being wise to order cuts. The only other example that springs to mind is James Cameron's pious additions to The Abyss for his ""special edition"". The added scenes do add slightly to our understanding of the story, but two hours and 38 minutes is simply too long, especially for a director as methodical as Milos Forman."

MovieAddict2016,"Oct 13, 2005",10/10,"Few films create such a lasting impact as ""Amadeus."" Although it may not be as well-recognized as some other classics, those ""in the know"" have been privy to one of the great films of the 20th century. Its Director's Cut re-release a few years ago re-established it as a classic, and enticed many new viewers.Personally, having been subjected to this film years ago, watching the Director's Cut is a delight, because it seems to flow even better now, even with an extra twenty minutes of runtime.The film begins with the composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) telling his story (and Mozart's) to a priest (Simon Callow). Antonio feels personally responsible for Mozart's early death, and finally - after years of silence - spills his beans.The flashbacks (intercut with scenes of Salieri reciting the story from memory) show us the infantile and juvenile Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (played by ""Animal House's"" Tom Hulce) and his domination of musical composure in Vienna, where he was the subject of jealousy from Salieri, whose lifelong dream was to be half as great as Mozart.The performances are wonderful - Hulce perfectly embodies the Mozart many of us weren't aware existed - the troubled, disrespectful and hyper-active man-child. Today, historians claim Mozart probably suffered from attention disorders like ADD. Whatever the reason for his behavior, Hulce never lets up on the believability.Even more impressive is F. Murray Abraham as Salieri. It is really he who carries the film on his shoulders and is the vital link to Mozart. I personally think it was a brilliant decision by Peter Shaffer (playwrite and scriptwriter) to convey the story through the eyes of another man close to Mozart, rather than Mozart himself. It's far more effective than a simple narrative, which would have detracted from the effortless intrigue of this movie. (Once you start watching, you're hooked - even though it's three hours long on the Director's Cut, it's over in what feels like less than half that long.) Milos Forman has been responsible for some wonderful films throughout his career (other highlights include ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"") but in my opinion, from a directorial standpoint, this is probably his strongest. ""Cuckoos' Nest"" may have had deeper themes and drawn greater parallels between characters and events and symbolism, but ""Amadeus"" doesn't need to be complicated, and it isn't. At heart it is the story of a brilliant composer and the man whose jealousy destroyed them both. This should be seen by everyone at least once - because once you see it, you'll come back for seconds."
KITHfan1,"Jun 4, 2003",10/10,"This cannot be taken as a biography. How many times must this be said until you people believe that? I love Mozart, and I also love this film. It never shows Salieri killing Mozart, in fact it never even shows Salieri as the Man in Black, it shows Salieri's reaction to Mozart and God. People blame this for bad feeling against Salieri, but that's simply not true. Salieri was a dead name until this film came about. People aren't stupid enough to think Salieri actually killed Mozart. I cannot understand anyone not liking this film. It's beautifully crafted, written and acted. It's a bit of historical fiction, and revived interest in Mozart. I love this film. I could go on, but I won't. W. A. Mozart is one of my favorite people of all time, and this film shows him in a very human way. They do not portray him as an untouchable genius, but as they very real man he was.   As an aspiring Mozart scholar I would know that this is not a very accurate film. But so what? It's beautiful, touching, and makes me cry every time I see it.   If you enjoy classical music, go see this film. If you enjoy good movies, go rent this. If you enjoy wonderful, character driven performances, go get this. You will not regret it. It's a wonderful, brilliant film"
soumik-datta,"Mar 30, 2005",7/10,"Forman, though he worked in Hollywood,was Polish; and his films often contain traces of the more subtle European art-house sensitivity. The most sensitive of these decisions in case of Amdeus was to invite the Academy of St. Martin's in the Fields to play the music in this film. Under the conduction of Sir Neville Mariner, St. Martin's had been definitely the best interpreter of Mozart's music in the 20th c. and their playing just lifts the film to another level.Having said that, the film is also visually stunning, though it relies heavily on the acting of F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as MOzart to carry it through. And they do carry it through with real aplomb. Especially Salieri comes across as an unforgettable character, though probably because his part is so amazingly well-written, from the brilliant description of the 'Gran Partita' in the beginning to the unbelievable death-bed sequence of Mozart where Salieri takes down whatever Mozart dictates, and what he dictates impromptu is the unfinished Requiem. Again a brilliant thing about this was how Shaffer and Forman constructs this sequence, breaking down the Requiem into its individual parts and lets the music just build up and carry us away. Working with a background score consisting of the best pieces of Mozart has its advantages, and Forman is so very much aware of that, that he consistently uses the music to overwhelm us."

Mozart is here described as a naughty spoiled brat, misbehaving with ladies, disrespectful of authority, wasting the money he really does not have. Overall, a man yearning for the youth he had been denied, a genius laughing at the inability of common people, a human being tortured by the music he cannot live without. Sallieri on the other hand, second-rate musician but true lover of music, probably understands Mozart better than anybody else. ""Here was the very voice of God"", he says of Mozart's music. ""I was staring through the cage of meticulous ink stokes at an absolute beauty"". But he cannot bring himself to help the genius he is so jealous of. Indeed, he will destroy him (""I will ruin your incarnation"", says he to God) and destroy himself in the process. A masterpiece, powerful, beautiful, enhanced by Mozart's music. Brilliant."

It is told through the filter of an acquaintances' Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) who struggles with God. Also, we see the movie, of course, may miss some of the plays but being a movie, we have replaced them with visions of Prague, where the movie was filmed.The only thing that can be a bit annoying to some people is the laughing style they gave Mozart (Tom Hulce) in this production.Be sure to watch the extra information where the different actors and the director talk about the trials and tribulations of getting a film crew into Prague in 1984 and having to deal with the secret police.Get a different view of the play in Midsomer Murders: The Death of a Hollow Man."

Abraham is of course superb, but as for the rest of the cast I can only say that this is one of the worst acted films I have ever seen.  While Mozart was impulsive, frivolous, and certainly not a saint, I was dismayed to find Hulce playing him like a total idiot.  Hulce never reveals to us the intelligence beneath the mask of silliness.  Great artists may sometimes be silly or half-crazy, but none of them are such complete morons.  Add to this mix some really bad dialogue and the result is a scandalously overrated film."

didi-5,"Dec 19, 2004",8/10,"This film of Peter Shaffer's play is fairly successful once you get past the clunky opening scenes where Mozart and his intended frolic under the tables and swap indecent puns with each other.From a very tight stage production, Shaffer opens out the action to include real-life scenes and scenarios rather than the theatrics of the dukes in the chorus. Salieri is the key character here, the title of the film notwithstanding, and is gloriously played by Oscar-winner F. Murray Abraham. Curious that Abraham didn't go on to get the meaty roles that should have been there for him.As Mozart, Tom Hulce is - in the early scenes - an irritating hyena, an overactive child. By the time of the Requiem and the closing scenes his acting talent truly comes to the fore, doing justice to the story and to the wonderful music. Elizabeth Berridge plays his wife Constance very well, while Roy Dotrice is a memorable Leopold (father of Wolfgang Amadeus). Jeffrey Jones is a twitchy Emperor (""too many notes!"") and Simon Callow, Charles Kay, and Martin Cavina make their mark in smaller roles.The true star of this film though, is the music, and you get to hear lots of it, thanks to Sir Neville Marriner and a team of great musicians."
requiem1896,"Feb 10, 2000",10/10,"Amadeus is one of Milos Foreman's masterpieces.  It is the story of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  The movie is visually stunning.  As a costume drama it is very accurate to Vienna during the time of Mozart's life.  It has a rather questionable ending (for the purpose of historical accuracy) and leans toward the belief that Mozart was slowly being poisoned to death. However the movie does not claim to be a biography so it cannot be marked because of this.  I gave this movie a 10 because it is so well put together. Everything from costume to set design to cinematography, editing, and directing is astounding.  The acting is also decent to great.  This movie is definitely one of the best of the 1980's.  It is a must see for any music fan as well as any fan of the great historical Dramas of Hollywood."
andyflavoured,"Mar 9, 2011",10/10,"First the only thing that really grates with me: the heavy American accents are a distraction and clearly undesirable in a movie principally about Italian and German composers.But to moan about that would be to overlook a simply magnificent film, one with the dramatic scope and scale of a grand opera, told through the unreliable recollections of Salieri at the end of his life. Great credit to the director (Forman), actors (especially Abraham, one of very few actors to deserve his Best Actor Oscar outright for the performance given), the city of Prague for recreating Vienna so beautifully, to Sir Neville Marriner for the best soundtrack of all time, and to Schaffer for a script that tells a powerful story in such a spellbinding fashion, artfully weaving fact and the fictions of Salieri.Put simply, Amadeus will always be among my top 3 movies of all time, with good reason. If you haven't already seen it, don't delay by so much as a minute!!"
Sylviastel,"Nov 3, 2006",10/10,"There are few films out there even today that can match Amadeus' incomparable genius. For starters, the two leading actors played by Oscar and Golden Globe Winner F. Murray Abraham and Oscar Nominee Tom Hulce play Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, two rival composers. When Abraham speaks, you can't take your eyes off him whether he is elderly or young and promising and gifted as well. He saves his envy for the spoiled musical prodigy Mozart who is also goofy and childish as well. It's Salieri who begins to despise his rival without telling him the truth of how much he resented Mozart's musical genius and that God chose Mozart over Salieri. Anyway, the backdrop which includes the lavish costumes and art direction are unforgettable. The movie takes you to another place and time where the same occurrences of rivalries, jealousies, and envy can be a powerful weapon of hatred. Mozart naively believes in Salieri's friendship and support. I don't care for the casting of American actors like Jeffrey Jones playing the Austrian emperor. Cynthia Nixon playing the maid hired by Salieri to spy on the Mozart family. I thought Elizabeth Berridge was adequate as well as Christine Ebersole. British actors like Roy Dotrice (when will be honored) and Simon Callow CBE are equally the same. It really is Salieri's film overall told from his point of view. You can't forget Mozart's unique laugh and his desire for his father's love who wants him back in Salzburg than in Vienna. Salieri's father died while he was young. We don't see much of the women in the film but that is expected since you expect that women were still second class citizens. Salieri envied Mozart's genius as well as zest for life outside music. He loved parties and people while Salieri preferred music. Oh what a film for the ages!"
cwarne_uk,"Feb 1, 2003",10/10,"Salieri is a decent, talented mediocrity. Mozart a brash repulsive genius. This is all historically very doubtful, but as a dark parable about how neither genius or talent are really rewarded works perfectly. Add to this the sumptuous sets, costumes and greatest film score ever you have a masterpiece."
RogueSix_85,"Jan 20, 2006",10/10,"Very, very few movies have all their pieces - acting, photography, plot, music, etc - come together in a more powerful way than they do in this film. Salieri is magnificent; the camera captures every subtle gesture while still taking in the staging of each delightful scene; the story is fascinating, and made only more dramatic by the exquisitely-performed soundtrack, featuring music by Herr Mozart himself and a few other contemporary pieces (played by St Martins-In-The-Fields, it fills three CDs and is worth every penny).Even my friends who do not enjoy classical music had to admit that this was a very well-done period piece. It poses an interesting philosophical dilemma, a hero-villain for whom we cannot help but feel empathetic, and gives us a glimpse into the fascinating politics, power, and music of the Classical Age.One word of advice: Do NOT see the Director's Cut. Several key scenes were added and changed that, I found, made a tremendous difference to my evaluation of the main characters and events in the film."
jaesboxer,"Dec 25, 2002",10/10,"Milos Forman's Amadeus is a truly magnificent picture.  A complicated character study, a dynamic blend of fact and fiction, and a dark, daring portrait of the madness that often accompanies genius.  F. Murray Abraham is positively brilliant as the bitter, envious Antonio Salieri, a mediocrity whose jealousy of the musical talent he believes god has bestowed upon Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce), thereby forsaking him, leads him into a descent of pure hatred and murderous conspiracy."
juliankennedy23,"Feb 19, 2005",7/10,Amadeus: 7 out of 10: Brilliantly filmed fictional account of the rivalry between Antonio Salieri (Well deserved Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham) and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce in a daring performance).The costumes and settings are spot on as only great Hollywood historical dramas can pull off. (This is one place independent film doesn't hold a candle to Hollywood). With the exception of Elizabeth Berridge as Mozart's wife the supporting cast is excellent (especially Jeffery Jones who plays Emperor Joseph the 2nd like Martin Sheen playing a Kennedy.)The plot line of an old Salieri confessing to a priest how he turned his back on God after realizing the almighty gave Mozart not himself this divine talent is a wonderful and emotionally satisfying tool to hang the plot. Salieri is a wonderful protagonist as it is easy to identify with the jealousy one feels towards those to whom talent comes so easy and seems almost squandered.Besides Berridge's performance there are a few minor quibbles with the film. The music is very opera heavy and not terrible representative of either Mozart's work or some of the pieces that invariably made him immortal (It's a bit like doing a biopic of Beethoven and leaving out his 5th and 9th symphonies.)The movie is also bit long and drags some in the middle. In one scene during the performance of The Marriage of Figaro the Emperor yawns and Salieri goes into great detail how the number of yawns affects how long the opera will run. At 2 hours 40 minutes it saying something that Amadeus only rated one yawn from myself.
mircea85,"Jul 10, 2005",4/10,"Mediocrity is not only the topic of this movie but also the movie itself. Is is mediocre to say least. One would expect more out of a movie called Amadeus. The correlation with Mozart is totally out of place. There is nothing in this movie about nobility, greatness, extraordinary people or anything else among the lines of higher understanding or one self's quest for betterness.The characters behave totally out of place. The action is taking places in the mids of aristocratic society yet everyone from the emperor to the opera director and to the servants behave like 21st century below-average income American citizens. The German (or Austrian) culture is fully ignored giving way to the ""american style"" (as it appears to common individual, not as it is in real life).The actions the characters take, as well as the results of those actions, are totally unwarranted. No reason is given as to way the character would act in the manner described or why their actions would yield the shown effect. This is deliberately so that it allows for ""desire gratification"". This is taking a wish out of real-life (son-father relationships is the mill for most such wishes in this movie), setting up a scene that will make one recognize his (perhaps frustrated) desire in it, and then, contrary to what would've happened in real-life {and by doing so destroying character consistency}, gratify it (with the proper evolution in the plot). This technique is also used for social manipulation in forming a distorted view of reality. One example is when ""the great Mozart"" has to submit his work to be evaluated by a committee despite the fact his works is great, he is intimate (i.e. close friends) with the emperor and the emperor could just appoint him. Like please, get real, in life people DO get appointed even when their work sucks just because they have access to the decision factors. As it must've become obvious by now, I am highly resentful of this type of ""your situation is better than you think and you should accept it as it is the same even for the most noble"".Art should propose a message and argue its validity, not try to impose it by all sorts of subliminal affirmations.Acting is terrible. Like no one really expects the people playing ballet on the scene truly be ballet-players. But they SHOULD move in at least a decent amount of sync. And when the piano is played, again, some correlation between the melody and the motion of the hands over the keys is expected.That being said, this is perhaps one of the best movies for its purposes. The story is told trough the eyes of the mediocre court-composer Antonio Salieri. The troubles of the characters are the troubles of the average individual of the 21st century (like bad credit, alcohol, bureaucracy, father, mother-in-law, etc.). What disappoints me about the movie is that these issues are not treated from a higher-perspective like one would expect but instead they are settled within the scope and understanding of the average individual."
DerBurns,"May 27, 2004",N/A,"Several comments in reply:1) ""Why opera in English?"" - Actually, it's pretty clever how they handle this... In the movie the Italian operas (Figaro, Don Giovanni and Salieri's Axur) are sung in Italian, but only the German operas (Abduction, Magic Flute and the parody-vaudeville) are in English. My supposition is that we assume that everyone in the movie is speaking German, but we hear it as English, except when they speak in Italian or some other language. It's like having a selective Babel-Fish (read Douglas Adams if that one is lost on you).2) ""Why would they refer to Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart as Wolfie?"" Believe it, because they did. Constanza refers to Mozart numerous times in her letters as ""Wolferl"" which could translate to English as ""Wolfie""... also believe me that she (and others) had names for him that would cause Buddy Hackett to blush. The letters of the Mozart family (Wolferl, his sister ""Nannerl"", and papa and mama Mozart) are full of scatalogical references and sexual humor that still seems pretty crude in our day and age.3) Salieri. Yes, he is quite maligned. I think everyone knows that. He was one of the most famous composers in Europe and gave lessons in vocal composition to Beethoven, among others. He even commanded one of the artillery batteries in the premiere of Beethoven's ""Wellington's Victory"". However, some of Beethoven's conversion books survive where Beethoven's nephew Karl writes that Salieri has gone mad and claims that he murdered Mozart. It's not true, of course, but could very well have been the product of an enfeebled mind."
SularetaLateraluS,"Oct 16, 2002",10/10,"I don't understand how people get off criticizing the film. It is practically flawless. The acting was incredible, and delivered incredible scenes. Mozart on his deathbead dictating music to Salieri is the best moment I have watched in any movie, period. I was awestruck. Anyone who speaks negatively about Amadeus is just trying to get people riled up, and should best be ignored.Brilliant."
paulblo,"Nov 28, 2002",10/10,"In good literature, there is a deep story, 3-D characters and many well thought out twists and turns. Unfortunately, in most hollywood productions, they seem to replace all this with a flimsy story, 2-D characters and predictable twists and turns. Luckily, Amadeus does not fall into this. I have always imagined what a good book would be like with a great soundtrack, and Amadeus gives me that picture. This music of Motzart seeps into every frame and gives the movie a life to it that would not be present in a book. This is one movie that should not be missed, a landmark standing apart from most of the (horrible) movies of the 80's."
ljp-2,"Mar 3, 2000",10/10,"There are so many things to say about this film that I could never get them all in! Most of them have been said by other reviewers anyway.I saw ""Amadeus"" in a theater when it first came out, applauded wildly when it won I don't know how many Academy Awards, and have enjoyed it any number of times on video since then.  Peter Schaffer brilliantly adapted his play, which became even more dramatic and human onscreen. The story is moving and profound, and the performances wonderful.  F. Murray Abraham was truly brilliant as the tormented mediocrity Salieri.  So was Tom Hulce as the callow genius Mozart.  Not too-often mentioned is Roy Dotrice as Papa Mozart; he was great, as was Jeffrey Jones in a slyly funny performance as the officious but empty-headed Emperor. I was delighted by the fact that the film avoided the stuffiness so often associated with period drama.  I will even confess that I giggle just as insanely as Amadeus every time Salieri calls Mozart ""The Creature""!  The scene where Salieri takes dictation from Mozart and we see artistic creation happening must be one of the greatest ever put on screen. I hope everyone takes the opportunity to see this wonderful film on video.OK, I do have some more serious stuff to say.  As a budding screenwriter myself, I was impressed by the writer's attention to depth of character, and subtle, interlocking themes.  As a student of cultural history, I was fascinated by how much history really came across onscreen.  Not necessarily historical fact (I know that Salieri didn't murder Mozart, and most likely didn't try, and there were undoubtedly many other inaccuracies, due to the need for condensation).  When I think history, I usually think of the history of ideas.  And if you want to look at the historical development that took place from the idea of the artist dedicated to God, and the modern one of an artist as a tormented individual, striving for excellence on his own, you can see it in Salieri.  And the film also made it clear how the coming revolutionary changes in 18th-19th Europe were to carry the artist from having to please a patron to having to make it in a democratic marketplace (well, until the founding of the NEA, anyway).  Just compare this film to that odious monstrosity ""Shakespeare in Love"", which also, inconceivably, won a Best-Pictur Oscar!  There, nothing goes beyond dull sitcom contrivance and cliches about the theater, and the conception of the characters is so thoroughly twentieth-century that no real historical ideas can possibly get though. Please, people, see ""Amadeus"" instead!"
senyoritademomo,"Sep 14, 2024",10/10,"Amadeus,"" directed by Milo Forman and released in 1984, is a captivating historical drama that portrays the tumultuous life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his contemporary, Antonio Salieri. The film, based on Peter Shaffer's play of the same name, combines lush period visuals with a gripping narrative to explore themes of genius, jealousy, and the nature of artistic creation.Tom Hulce delivers a dynamic performance as Mozart, capturing the composer's brilliance and eccentricity, while F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri provides a deep and complex look at envy and self-doubt. The film's use of Mozart's music enhances its emotional and dramatic impact, making it a compelling experience both visually and audibly.Critically acclaimed for its direction, acting, and screenplay, ""Amadeus won eight Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor for Abraham. It remains a powerful and engaging film, offering a dramatic interpretation of the life and struggles of one of classical music greatest figures."
gavin6942,"May 12, 2010",9/10,"Peter Schaffer (perhaps better known as the writer of ""Equus"") has an interesting tale to tell: an annoying laugh coming from the belly of God through the mouth of Amadeus, which angers and frustrates his chief rival. Is there a historical basis for the laugh, the rivalry, or the manner of Amadeus' death? Not really, but we can just let that slide because it makes a good story.I really loved this film ,and even though it was nearly three hours long, it seemed to go very quickly. Tom Hulce, who I know from nothing else, was a delightful Amadeus. At first he was a pain, but once I adjusted and began to sympathize with him, I think he played the part perfectly. Beyond that, everyone played their parts well -- even Jeffrey Jones, who (for me) is hard to see as anything but a comic actor or a Tim Burton regular."
danielll_rs,"Feb 20, 2000",9/10,"Biographical films are all just the same. They start showing the childhood of the person portrayed, after that how he/she started to make success or to have prominence, then his/her marriage, the children and finally the very sad death- if it doesn't show the person dying, it shows some subtitles saying what happened. Of course there are some exceptions, as ""Hilary and Jackie"" (that is great, even following this formula) and this masterpiece, ""Amadeus"", that tells by flashback the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Milos Forman is a great director, and also proved that with ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"", ""Valmont"" and ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"" (also a biography). Instead of showing a light, sweet, depressing story, he decided to make a disturbing film, with some suspense and wonderful visually.Antonio Salieri is a musician who is not very recognized and for that he envies Mozart, showed as a very weird man, but also with a very recognized talent. Salieri can't stand this situation and he will do anything to get this over. With this simple storyline, the film tells a important story, about envy and ambition, both present in our world. Forman's aim was just to focus on this situation. So, yes, he may have committed some historycal mistakes, but it doesn't matter. With a great screenplay, great cast, wonderful costumes, music and scenery, he did a superb film, winning 9 worthy Oscars.""Amadeus"" is a must-see, even if you don't like classical music."
Fluke_Skywalker,"Apr 6, 2015",7/10,"At its core, Milos Forman's multi-award winning adaptation of Peter Shaffer's play 'Amadeus' is really just a soap opera with extremely lush production values.F. Murray Abraham is captivating in his Golden Globe and Oscar winning role of a man driven mad by jealousy. Relating the tale to the audience via a young priest, it creates an intimacy that helps to pull the audience in. Tom Hulce feels a bit too ""I want my MTV"" era contemporary as Mozart, but he brings a giddy energy to the role that works as a great counterbalance to Abraham.In the end 'Amadeus' isn't good history, but it is a good soapy tragicomedy."
daumas,"Jul 17, 1999",10/10,"At the same time we watch a excellent movie, we learn more about the classic musician Mozart, well performed by Hulce. At the same time Murray Abraham is excellent as Salieri, the antagonist of Mozart, and he deserved his Oscar. Unfortunately, Hulce didn't receive his. Some folks told me that the story wasn't exactly as they told but who cares? No strong scenes, no sex either. My kids loved to watch this movie.... Absolutely brilliant."

jdaniels-4,"Dec 11, 2003",1/10,"This film might have been able to get by on wonderful music and grandiose spectacle, but casting an American actor to play Mozart (and his chick) is a serious mis-service to history. The fact that many reviewers approve of this movie & rate it so highly is proof of this. I'm not against American culture per se (far from it) but the Americanisation of history in films (i.e. which gives the impression that many significant figures from the past grew up somewhere near Disneyland) is a terrible thing - it whitewashes cultural diversity & gives a totally distorted view of the world as it was, and still is. This cannot be overlooked. If an Austrian actor was chosen for the part (not Arnie) the film probably would have made less money so I guess that wasn't an option? Better to cast someone who appeared in ""Animal House""? Instead of a ""Directors' cut"" how about a ""Realistic cut""? Please explain?...well, if one of the characters in ""Amadeus"" had stepped out to buy a cheeseburger from Macdonald's or had switched on ""MTV"" at some point in this movie, it would not have seemed out of place - in what's supposed to be the story of an Austrian composer who lived in the 18th century!  In other words, Houston, we have a problem!"
FlyingTampon,"Jul 13, 2003",10/10,"""Amadeus"" is my favorite film of all-time. Usually I am not a fan of historical dramas. The movie centers around Italian composer Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), who is committed to a mental institution after trying to kill himself. He blames himself for the death of the legendary Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce).Salieri's life and music is faint due to his jealously of Mozart. He is fascinated yet disgusted by Mozart...and wonders why God would use a vulgar, boorish child to be the best composer in history. I like the Director's Cut DVD better, which portrays Mozart's wife Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge) in a more dramatic, involved role. After seeing the prolific scene with Constanze and Salieri, you will see why Constanze carries such disdain for him. Salieri's self-worth is destroyed and he finally accepts he is merely a 'mediocrity'. After seeing this piece of art (I cannot just call it a 'movie'), I grew fond of classical music. The operas and plays were very realistic, as if you were actually in 18th century Vienna! The costumes were lavish, accents perfected, Prague setting majestic and the music was beautiful.Overall, I give 'Amadeus"" an A+"
jens-sanderhoff,"Jul 1, 2002",10/10,"This movie changed my point of view on the composer W.A. Mozart. As I experienced it in the movie theater back in the mid-eighties, I was startled with the fact what a promotion of very old music could be of such beauty. Since then I have seen the movie about a hundred times, and I am looking forward to the Director's Cut-version. It is perhaps the best movie ever made."
willow_chick88,"Sep 5, 2002",10/10,"Amadeus is my favorite movie of all time. I spent much time deliberating this after my dad declared that ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" was his favorite movie of all time. I love this movie because I love music more than anything, except for books. The music in this film is the most magnificent ever written and if ""The Marriage of Figaro"" doesn't make you cry than another piece surely will. The acting is simply phenomenal. Tom Hulce is amazing as Mozart and every other performance he does is shaped by this one. I even love the laugh. Still, the best performance is F. Murray Abraham's with his ability to go from madness to utter lucidity in one line. The costumes are amazing and some day if I can I want to design my house like the apartment of the Mozarts.

Falko_h1,"Jul 3, 2024",7/10,"""Amadeus,"" directed by Milos Forman, is a lavish and compelling exploration of the rivalry between composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. Set in the vibrant musical world of 18th-century Vienna, the film vividly portrays Mozart's genius and Salieri's envy, blending historical drama with fictionalized intrigue.Tom Hulce delivers an unforgettable performance as Mozart, capturing both his brilliant talent and his impish personality. F. Murray Abraham shines as Salieri, whose intense jealousy and inner turmoil drive much of the film's drama. Their dynamic is at the heart of ""Amadeus,"" offering a gripping narrative that delves into themes of genius, jealousy, and the destructive nature of envy.The film's production values are impeccable, with stunning period costumes and elaborate sets that immerse the viewer in the opulence of the era. The soundtrack, rich with Mozart's compositions, enhances the storytelling, making the music a character in its own right.While ""Amadeus"" takes liberties with historical accuracy, its dramatic flair and emotional depth make it a captivating watch. It skillfully balances humor, tragedy, and music, creating a rich, entertaining experience that resonates with audiences. The film's blend of historical drama and musical genius ensures it remains a timeless classic."
pinewood35jack,"Feb 21, 2000",9/10,"I wasn't sure whether I would like this film when I was about to see it but after just ten minutes I was engrossed. The life of Mozart was very interesting but what made the film so good was that the film took the perspective of someone who loved Mozart's work but hated him at the same time. This is what makes it so fascinating. The costume design was magnificent along with the directing and acting, all together it was a great movie but it didn't have the sting that I look for in movies. For instance I felt Psycho had everything with that sting but Amadeus had everything but lacked that sting. Maybe others will feel that this film is one of their favourites but despite how good I think it is I can't place it in my top 20."
lostncis,"May 21, 2016",6/10,"The movie of Salieri's life, through which Mozart played an integral part, is told in flashback mode, beginning in around the year 1822. An old and perhaps emotionally disturbed Antonio Salieri attempts suicide, and in doing so, apologizes for killing Mozart some 31 years earlier. He survives and is admitted to an insane asylum, where he tells a young priest his tale of jealousy and mediocrity.The priest is fascinated and alternately troubled by the lengthy and emotional story. Salieri tells of growing up in Italy with a father who did not care for music; and how he rejoiced for the chance to go to Vienna after his father's untimely death. He tells of how he first had met the young Mozart, and how immature and dirty minded Mozart was. He also tells of how ""The Creature"" had an intimate relationship with the girl that Salieri had cared for. Most importantly, however, he confided in the priest that he had learned to hate God for giving him a deep love of music, only to deny him the talent to create truly memorable music. He thought God had given him Mozart to mock him. Salieri's heart filled with such rage, such hatred and such jealousy, that he had vowed to himself to make God an enemy and to kill the young Mozart.As the movie moves along, carrying with it a deep sadness of the human condition, it also celebrates life by giving the audience joyous music, wonderful atmosphere and a general appreciation of humanity for not only eighteenth century Europe, but in any age where music speaks for our emotions."
harry-76,"Mar 16, 1999",3/10,"It is my understanding that, according to a many music historians and musicologists, Antonio Salieri did conspire against Mozart. And while this may be worhty of some interest as a footnote or even a few paragraphs in a Mozart biography, it is not a justification for the bloated treatment rendered in ""Amadeus."" Lacking a good enough slant for a powerful dramatic depiction, the writer latched on to this gimmick to propel the story to a wider audience. While we can be grateful for an opportunity to hear this great music and thrill to the recreation of some of the period settings, we cannot be happy about this distorted approach to biography. Nor can we feel elated over the decision to make the character of Mozart a cackling, show-off buffoon. There is a great deal missing from this composer biography, and it is saddening to think that this may be considered a definitive depiction of the life of this great composer. There comes a point when historical accuracy and integrity must override purely commercial motives."
ThreeSadTigers,"May 15, 2008",N/A,"Milos Forman's adaptation of Peter Shaffer's award winning stage play of the life and ultimate downfall of composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce) and his difficult relationship with arch rival Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) is certainly something of a flawed work, albeit, one that is incredibly pleasant and engaging nonetheless. The principal focus of the film is on the character of Salieri, from his guilt ridden suicide attempt at the beginning of the film, through to the scenes in which he recounts his story to a priest from the confines of a mental hospital. From here, the film deals mainly with Salieri's crippling jealousy over the younger composer and the natural rivalry that intensifies between them, as Mozart's natural talent and flair for presentation finds him embraced by the Emperor (Jeffery Jones) and the people of Vienna.As Mozart gains more and more success, it is Salieri's obsession to destroy the composer at any means necessary that drives the narrative further and further. Although you could argue that the whole thing is woefully inaccurate in a historical scene, you can't help but marvel at the film's style, wit and excellent period evocation. Shaffer's script fizzes with depth and amusing character quirks that should resonate with anyone who has some familiarly with the actual story at hand, while Forman's direction is close to Kubrick's greatest film Barry Lyndon (1975) in terms of scope, scale and detail. Here, the director is aided by cinematographer Miroslav Odericek's and his staggering use of composition and lighting, with the look, combined with the costume and production design evoking the true grimy beauty of the period.There is also a great pace being maintained by the editing of the film, with some interesting juxtapositions between the worlds of these two composers, and the intelligent use of Salieri as the teller of the story, which opens the film up to ideas of the unreliable narrator, thus somewhat anarchically excusing itself from the more obvious inaccuracies. This all goes towards making Amadeus (1984) a fascinating character study with some wonderfully bawdy comedy and, unsurprisingly, that fantastic use of music. A great look at one man's shallow obsession to share his art with the people and god, but is overshadowed at every turn by a much greater talent, something he only realises too late."
johnrp-1,"Oct 3, 2002",10/10,"I saw the Broadway play years back, with F. Murray Abraham playing Salieri. It was nothing less than spellbinding. Afterwards, I went to see the movie. I was prepared to be disappointed, but the movie was just as compelling, just as engaging as watching it on stage. Aside from the obvious accolades for stunning costumes and, of course, the music, what makes this movie so wonderful is the amazing acting. There are scenes that carry more acting skill in a couple minutes then many movies have in total.And again, I must mention the music. So incredibly wonderful. And just in case you're wondering ... I'm a rock fan from the 70's!"
ackstasis,"Jul 3, 2007",9/10,"Though Milos Forman is rarely mentioned among the greats of Hollywood directing, he has certainly left an indelible mark on cinema. Creator of at least two indisputable masterpieces, Forman's films have won Best Picture at the Academy Awards on two occasions, and he has also won the Best Director Oscar for these two same films. The film that brought most of his initial fame was the glorious 'One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest' of 1975, based on the popular novel by Ken Kesey and starring Jack Nicholson and Louise Fletcher. In the next nine years, Forman only produced another three films: 'Hair,' 'Ragtime' and 'Amadeus,' respectively.Released in 1984, 'Amadeus' is based on the 1979 stage play by Peter Shaffer, which was inspired by Aleksandr Pushkin's short play, ""Mozart and Salieri,"" and loosely traces the lives of composers Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Antonio Salieri. The film opens with Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) in a mental institution, after having attempted suicide. Now old and frail, he speaks to a young priest (Herman Meckler),who has come to hear his confession. Salieri expresses bitterness that his former-talents have faded into obscurity with passing time, whilst the works of the young prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce) have become legendary. Having known of the talented composer for most of his life, and having developed a hatred towards Mozart because of his own inferiority, Salieri ultimately blames himself for his death. Through his confession to the priest, Salieri explains how his association with Mozart destroyed his entire life.It is perhaps surprising to newcomers that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is not the main character in the film. As the skilled but envious Antonio Salieri, F. Murray Abraham is the epitome of good acting, delivering a dark and brooding performance that deservedly earned him an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Abraham is mesmeric as the successful composer who makes a pact with God to be the greatest in history, in exchange for his complete and unwavering devotion. When it appears that this gift has been bestowed upon another, Salieri rejects the Lord, and makes it his life's mission to destroy the talented young man through whom God speaks His voice.Tom Hulce, despite also being nominated for Best Actor for his role, is often cited as the one misstep of the film. I completely disagree, since the idea that Hulce feels out-of-place is the very point that the film is trying to make. When he hears of all that Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has accomplished, Salieri was expecting to meet a sombre, respectable genius, only to first come across Mozart crawling on the floor, engaged in vulgar sex-games and uttering jokes about flatulence. This is what ultimately leads Salieri to abandon his pact with God: after all his own unwavering loyalty, how could the Lord have chosen this ""unprincipled, spoiled, conceited brat"" through which to channel His voice? Of course Tom Hulce's portrayal of Mozart was juvenile and somewhat irritating, since it was supposed to be.Hulce based his character's annoying laugh on real descriptions of the composer, which referred to it as ""an infectious giddy"" and ""like metal scraping glass."" Also, though the historical accuracy of Shaffer's play was met with much scrutiny, it appears authentic (if slightly over-exaggerated) that Mozart had something of a vulgar and loutish personality. For example, it is known that the famed composer wrote canons on the the words ""Leck mich im Arsch"" and ""Leck mich im Arsch recht fein schön sauber"" as party pieces for his friends. However, the supposed rivalry between Salieri and Mozart is most likely completely fictional. In real life, Salieri frequently lent Mozart musical scores from the court library with which he was charged; he often chose compositions by Mozart for performance at state occasions, and Salieri taught Mozart's son, Franz Xaver.Despite running for almost three hours, 'Amadeus' is a surprisingly easy movie to sit through, helped along by brilliant performances and a brisk pace. The use of a classical musical score  mostly comprised of Mozart's pieces, conducted by Sir Neville Marriner at the Academy of St. Martin in the Fields  is positively perfect for the film, proving that, even though he lived many centuries ago, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart is still far better than even the most gifted cinema composers of the twentieth century."
theatremarmot,"Jun 14, 2004",10/10,"In regards to how ""horrendous"" and ""absurd"" it is that they base the movie around the idea of Mozart being murdered, well...start using your imagination. Not every movie is based on historical fact. This is a big ""What if?"" movie...it's not saying ""Yes, we believe it happened THIS way""...it's just elaborating on a myth. There's no fault in that.I found it an entertaining movie with remarkable performances by everyone in the cast, namely the two leading men. While perhaps it is not my favorite movie of all time, and perhaps it isn't solely based on fact alone, it was still an enjoyable and visually compelling."
Amadeus3000,"Apr 28, 2004",10/10,"While there were good movies in the 80s such as Raging Bull, ET, Tootsie, Platoon, Glory, and Wall Street, Amadeus is my favorite. I admit only Raging Bull is more groundbreaking but Amadeus is fun to watch again and again. I still can't decide whether F. Murray Abraham or Tom Hulce should have won the Oscar. However Milos Foreman and the movie itself earned well-deserved the Oscars. The laugh is unforgettable and the ending was very dramatic and moving. While based on some fact the movie is more Hollywood since there is no true Mozart biography to make it 100% perfect. We watched it in a school class just a couple months ago and everyone into it laughing and in shock by the end. I had already seen it several times by then. This is well worth anybodys time. AFI's #53, 10 out of 10"
minamizaki,"Nov 29, 2009",10/10,"Just watched it again the other day, still love it, this movie doesn't age. It's tragic, comical and cynical at the same time, just like Mozart's opera buffa. I think Wolfie would have loved it too. F. Murray Abraham's performance is perfect, I try to find one scene where he's not so good, and there's none. Those scenes where he recalls his history with Mozart to the priest is especially well done. Salieri adores Mozart's music genuinely and resents his god given talent bitterly. Abraham just waves through the admiration, jealousy, bitterness, pain, self-loathe, cynicism and borderline insanity seamlessly."
inspirelake,"Mar 10, 2025",6/10,"If it were based on far, far more correct real history, it would have received a ten from me.However, false historical fiction and I have a hate/hate relationship.Surely, with two such fascinating and brilliant composers there must have been another angle? Surely, the truth is more interesting than disparaging a once living composer and pretending, for 'entertainment' that he was a hateful, venegeful and murderous entity? That's just SLANDER.Anyone who thinks liberties like that are ok for the purpose of 'entertainment' is a sadly lacking in character.To the movie: Parts of it are so absurd as to be a black comedy or a parody, surely? So tongue in cheek that all those raving about it must see it. It just isn't serious and I have issues with that as well, in so many movies. Would those watching think it just lovely if, once they're dead and can't defend themselves to tell the truth, utter bs is dribbled about them?The costumes are superb as are those dreadful overdone elite building interiors. But nonetheless, beautiful. The musical score is superb! The acting is very good, but often weird. If it were a movie without the premise of being about 'real' people, it would have been a very enjoyable watch. But I stand with my hatefest of nonsense."
igor-28,"Jan 6, 2005",10/10,"The story of Salieri is classic. The guy just chose the wrong profession. He should have become a music critic, not a musician. He wants to compose to the glory of God, but fails, simply because he is not talented enough. On the other side he has the gift to see the astonishing talent and genius of Mozarts music. Thats what makes Salieri a unique character in recent film history. The best critic ever seen on screen in a leading role. Besides that, Mozart is not the leading character in this movie. We see Mozart from the eyes of an admirer. Thats why we get a totally wrong impression from the life and work of this musical genius. The ultimate climax of the movie, the requiem scene in Mozarts flat shows the melting of two characters into one. Salieri becomes Mozart for a night. The synthesis of criticism and creativity."
andropeter,"Apr 8, 2024",6/10,"Nice music and nice character of Mozart, but too much focus on Salieri and made too evil. Pure speculation. Not enough focus on Mozart history and his music. Not a bad movie but could have been much better.Plot: he movie begins in Vienna in 1823 as an old man, Antonio Salieri (played by F. Murray Abraham), cries out that he has killed Mozart and then attempts suicide. He is taken to an asylum, where Father Vogler (Richard Frank) comes to see him, and Salieri tells him his story. As a young man, Salieri wished to be a composer, like the much younger and already famous Mozart, but his father is opposed. Salieri prays to God, promising to remain celibate and devoted if God will make him a famous composer. When Mozart enters in his life he plots against him out envy."
tracywinters-44332,"Apr 8, 2017",3/10,"Tom Hulce as Mozart basically ruins the film with his relentless mugging; he was only chosen because of his cackling laugh.The movie has lavish set designs and costumes, but the underlying hatred of Italians makes the film mean-spirited. In fact, ask yourself why the film-makers wanted to disrespect the Italians so vehemently. Other mistakes include the casting of Lez Berridge, who annoyingly refers to 'Wolfgang Mozart' as ""Volfie"", her Brooklyn accent in tow-- make that her Coney Island accent.Worth tuning in to see a perfect performance by Murry Abrahum playing the Italian musical genius, Antonio Salieri."
pooholf,"Nov 26, 1998",10/10,"A centuries-old Calvinist theory of pre-destination underlies Amadeus: a composer (Salieri) who dedicates his life and work to God becomes envious when he sees his efforts to please God met with indifference and scorn because God chose another (Mozart) as his musical incarnation. Salieri is perplexed beyond sanity that, in contrast with his own saintly lifestyle, the Chosen One is a vulgar runt who tells filthy jokes, plays around with women, and giggles like a hyena. Enraged and humilated when he recognizes that his hard work falls far short of Mozart's effortless superiority, he decides to strike back at God by trying to destroy his loved one.Most of the music is Mozart's own, performed by major league musicians, and it is a rare thrill to encounter such music, so well performed, in a movie. But you don't need to like classical music to enjoy this picture, which contains high drama, profound character study, comedy and tragedy, and is a Thanksgiving feast for the eyes as well as the ears with its lush backgrounds and 18th-century costumes. A masterwork of a film, without weakness anywhere. Name any department: music, acting, direction, costumes, cinematography, and only one word applies to any of them: ""10""."
HSauer,"Nov 18, 1999",9/10,"This powerful narrative of Mozart's adult career in Vienna - largely devoted to his operatic work, as befits a theatrical event - runs about 30 minutes longer than it might have, and has the power to put attentive viewers to sleep, or into a sort of hypnotic funk.  Mozart's last days are stretched out inordinately.  Nevertheless, this film has depth, humor, and one of the greatest soundtracks you'll ever hear.  The historical facts are inseparable from the fantasy that forms the basis of the plot, so beware of citing Amadeus as an authority on the lives of Mozart & Salieri.  Mozart was not so unworldly in real life, nor was Salieri so obsessed with his colleague, at least while both were alive.  Mozart's music was very popular throughout Europe, though he didn't earn as much money from his compositions as he deserved.  While Mozart didn't die entirely forsaken, as the movie implies, he was a victim of bad health exacerbated by overwork.  Consider that modern ""recording artists"" like Michael Jackson, et. al. release a dozen new compositions every 4 or 5 years, while Mozart composed two full-length operas and the bulk of a Requiem mass, among other things - several hours of classic music - in a few months, while he was dying.  Anyway, about the movie - see it and fall in love with Mozart's music!"
matthussong,"Jul 24, 2002",10/10,"I've loved this film ever since I saw it for the first time during my freshman year of high school back in 1988.  Just recently, I saw the director's cut in New York City and fell in love with it even more.  The added scenes brought so much more to the movie, especially the seduction scene between Stanzi and Salieri.  That scene made me understand her anger towards Salieri in a later scene.  Perfection!"
philip_vanderveken,"Jan 11, 2005",9/10,"I've always hated costume dramas, especially when the story is situated in 18th century Austria or Germany. There is just too much gold foil, too much ugly wigs and pompous costumes, too much over the top decors, just too much of everything that I detest.Big was my surprise when I saw ""Amadeus"". For the first time I wasn't trying to switch channels as soon as possible. From the first minute on it had my attention and never let me go, not even after the movie was finished. What I liked most was the co-operation between the music and the images. It all added to the drama. If a modern composer had written the music for some parts of the movie, I'm sure it wouldn't have been as great as it was now. I've never been a huge fan of classical music, but I sure can appreciate it from time to time. And there can be no doubt about how good the music in this movie is of course. It's Mozart, what more do you need? If you can't appreciate this music at all, than I'm afraid there is something wrong with your education. There is more in life than screaming guitars or techno beats.So for me the big star in this movie was the music, but I have to say that I also liked the way the story was told. I liked the flashbacks, telling the story from Salieri's point of view, the old and bitter man who now lives in an insane asylum, completely forgotten and still in Mozart's shadow. He explains to a priest what exactly had happened and why he always wanted to murder Mozart. I don't really know if all this is historically accurate, but I don't have any doubts about the fact that this is good cinema.Overall the movie was great, but sometimes there were a few details that bothered me. My feelings about the costumes, the wigs and typical architecture you already know, but there were also other things. Mozart's giggle for instance. It annoyed me enormously. I understand that it shows that this man was still very immature from time to time, that he sometimes still acted like a child, but still... Nevertheless I have to admit that this is a wonderful movie and despite some minor flaws it was almost perfect. I give it a 9/10."
johnny_zhang_yi,"Aug 4, 2007",10/10,"Although filled with rather tedious scenes and occasionally lackluster attempts of humor, this is definitely one of the most remarkable movies in terms of drawing its audiences into the realm of the protagonists. This achievement is primarily brought by the carefully selected background music connects perfectly with the movies from scene to scene, but most importantly, all the background music are Mozart's compositions, and through this movie we celebrate Mozart as a great composer who can transfer his feelings not by language, but by music. And it is a guarantee that by the end of the movie, you will be so completely absorbed into this movie that you will forget to take the DVD out until the cast list is over. Unlike other movies, Amadeus requires the utmost attention to every line, every detail of the movie, otherwise you will be lost. For the same reason, you may actually appreciate watching this movie a lot more after the first viewing."
JBachman,"Dec 28, 1999",10/10,"One of the best films ever made, from the actors to the costumes, to the lighting. To do this film from Salieri's viewpoint was an excellent choice. The soundtrack is excellent, and if you're not a fan of classical music, watching this movie and being able to understand Mozart and what a genius he truly was, you will begin to appreciate classical music, or at least his. Today's artists get paid millions for singing songs that most of them don't even write, yet Mozart composed more than 600 pieces of music in his short 35 years of life, probably earning less than what he was worth. A great movie that never gets dull or boring, I recommend it highly!"
stefanbe,"Jul 5, 2007",10/10,"Without music, would life have as much meaning? Whether it's The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Frank Sinatra or Beethoven, music plays an important part in inspiring people. When writing, I like to listen to music, specifically classical pieces. One of the best classical composers was Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, whose life is brought to the screen in Milos Forman's Amadeus. Well, not all of his life as most of what is portrayed in the film never actually happened in real life. That is not a flaw of the film, however, as Peter Shaffer manages to still create a fascinating story that keeps us gripped throughout the three hour running time. Forman recently released the Director's Cut on DVD, adding about twenty minutes of new footage and it surprisingly enough, improves the theatrical version that graced cinema screens and won eight Academy Awards in 1984. This is the version of Amadeus more worthy of being in your DVD collection.Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham), a court composer in Vienna, is excited about the arrival of his musical idol since childhood, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (Tom Hulce). However, much to Salieri's shock, Mozart turns out to be a vulgar, immature creature who just happens to be blessed with the power to produce beautiful music. Salieri soon watches his world change as he realises that his own music isn't so great when compared to the impressive operas that Mozart churns out. After watching Mozart mock him at a party, Salieri decides that he must do away with him somehow and take his revenge on God, who he has since declared his enemy for giving the beautiful gift of music to a vulgar, little man with an annoying laugh.Milos Forman and Petter Shaffer created a masterpiece with Amadeus, a startling portrayal of two different men thrust together. F Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce both received very well deserved Oscar nominations for their performances and they both give their characters the right tone. Mozart is a fun individual who surprises people with his impressive music despite his personality (and obnoxious laugh), but is soon going to deeper into debt and alcoholism. Hulce portrays Mozart's nuances so perfectly and Abraham is just as terrific. One of the main reasons that Amadeus is such a terrific film is the fact that when things do not go Salieri's way, we are just as upset as he is, because we feel for his pain. Mozart provides Amadeus with comic relief, while Salieri provides it with torturing pain. That's just how good the performances, script and direction allow these characters work, especially in their final scenes together.The supporting players are also integral to the plot as well, though. Jeffrey Jones is almost comical as an emperor with an attention span of two hours and requests Mozart to cut a few notes from his operas. Catherine Berridge is the actor in the film given the most opportunity to shine thanks to the Director's Cut. Forman looks deeper into the character of Mozart's wife, Constanze and she is given a much more important role than in the theatrical version and there is even bigger reason as to why she is shocked to see Salieri in Mozart's room at the time of his death. And of course, I would be crazy of me not to mention the glorious sets, costumes and makeup effects that are so important in bringing 1700's Vienna to life. This is one of the best films to come out of American cinema and a treat for even those who aren't too fond of classical music. In fact, those who are fans will be very happy with Warner's remastered soundtrack of the film which booms through the speakers and you feel as if you yourself is in one of the opera palaces with Salieri and Mozart."
kenjha,"Jan 7, 2010",7/10,"This mostly fictional account of the relationship between Mozart and Salieri, a journeyman contemporary composer, is well filmed but has ""too many scenes,"" to paraphrase Emperor Joseph. At three hours, it overstays its welcome with repetitive scenes. Was it necessary to spend 20 minutes on ""Don Giovanni""? The film's portrayal of Mozart as a vulgar buffoon is hard to reconcile with his genius for creating sublime music. Also, it gives the impression that Mozart only composed operas whereas the vast majority of his output is non-operatic. While Abraham is brilliant as Salieri, Hulce's idiot act becomes tiresome, and Berridge is badly miscast as Constanze. Jones is amusing."
silvercloud9,"Jul 20, 2003",5/10,"I honestly cannot fathom the enduring popularity of this film.  It is over-produced, garish and vulgar, directed with a ham-fist by Milos Forman...and would appear to be only incidentally about Mozart's music.  I know, I know, the point is that hapless, buffoonish Mozart was also, ironically, a prolific and endlessly inventive fountain of matchlessly elegant, mostly joyous and altogether perfect music (though emphatically and unfortunately not the politically astute schemer that the plodding, envious and sinister Salieri was).  However interesting the conception of this film undeniably is as a dramatic device, would not an important additional point of a biographical picture about the life and times of a composer be to attempt to somehow relate that life to the creation of his music?  I don't imagine that this relationship was quite as arbitrary and incidental as it is presented here; the music itself, and its connection with Mozart's life and soul, is given pretty short shrift, in my opinion, and is not in fact a subject at all.  The screen  is instead filled to bursting, like an over-stuffed sofa, with broad cartoonish performances, frantic cutting, goggle-eyed camera work, and hideous wigs and make-up that attempt unsuccessfully to present a highly stylised re-creation of the Eighteenth Century.  Where in all of this indigestible and copious display is the soul and spirit of Mozart's matchless elegance, lightness and clarity, which was in many ways the definitive musical expression of the soul and spirit of the Eighteenth Century itself?  Not anywhere apparent that I can detect.  If you, as a filmgoer, want to experience a magically evocative and completely realised  stylisation of the 18th C. I suggest you view ""Fellini's Casanova"" (and ignore the dubbing and stilted performances).  And if you want to see a brilliantly expressive and gorgeous film about a Great Composer (Beethoven), and his times, his soul and his music, and his enigmatic life as an artist, then seek out, and savor, ""Immortal Beloved""(1994).  A magnificent film, and everything that busy, noisy tedious and empty ""Amadeus"" is not.  Sorry, but ""Amadeus"" stinks."

DanB-4,"Sep 6, 1999",10/10,"Oh, how I love this film.F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning portrayal of Salieri alone makes this film infinitely watchable. I saw this at the age of 19 and walked out of the theater and for the first time said to myself, ""This is the best movie I have ever seen."" It currently sits high in my all-time top ten.Don't go looking for history retold. Few true stories re-told accurately make great films. But the creative liberties taken here add spice, intrigue and drama and do not detract one bit from the film.One of the great achievements of filmmaking and the best scene in this picture has Mozart, weakened by fever, essentially dictating his Requiem to Salieri. As the movement builds from Mozart's imagination, we can see Salieri finally accept the extent of his true genius. That is certainly director's Milos Forman's finest hour - especially when you stop to consider how badly that could have played out.I think that those of use who grew up musicians appreciate this movie more, not because of Mozart, but because we can relate to the searing hatred and jealously of Salieri. For all of us, no matter how hard we tried, there was always someone better.This movie translates poorly to the small screen, as do most epics - but it is still a worthwhile rental. Here you will see the peak of Forman's, Abraham's and Hulce's career, played out with a little bit of history and heaps of extraordinary entertainment.   Without question,  **** out of ****."
gazebo350,"Feb 4, 2007",9/10,Admittingly this is a highly entertaining film. the historical accuracy is poor however. salieri as everyone should know by now was not Mozart's assassin. this was a tale that was bruited about for sometime without foundation. turning perhaps the greatest musical genius that has ever lived into a buffoon however is an even greater travesty. however once you have jumped this hurdle the movie offers much entertainment in its showing of scenes from some of his most famous operas. costumes and sets are superb of course and very life like. still it is many miles ahead of the pablum that was offered back in the 1940's in terms of bios of great composers. Mozart was a man of many moods. childlike in some ways. and naive of the ways of the world in others perhaps. scatological jokes were rampant however in the lives of the southern Germans (mozarts father) and Austrians (mozarts mother). you would have to read of the letters these two sent each other to know that bodily functions in the 18th century were much more out in the open than in todays much greater privacy. that would help explain Mozart's sometimes out of the norm tom foolery. it was part of the patois of the time. still you have occasion to hear some of the most beautiful music written and i suppose be grateful for that. when will we ever have a lifelike portrayal of the great composers? a brilliant spectacle non the less.
ryannell,"Feb 8, 2004",10/10,"This film must rate as one of the most wonderful movie experiences you will ever have.

moonspinner55,"Apr 15, 2006",6/10,"Well-made and mounted chronicle of the relationship between opera composers Mozart and Salieri, the latter a court-appointed Vienna composer who simply could not keep up with the effortless showmanship of his prime competition. Peter Shaffer adapted his own celebrated play and Milos Forman helmed the smooth direction (both won Oscars), but neither is very generous in showing us the creative process behind the music. There's far more love for the classical pieces on display than actual insight into how the music was created. F.

evanston_dad,"Mar 17, 2008",9/10,"Milos Forman serves up a deliciously macabre film based on the Peter Schaffer play about brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and lesser composer and Mozart arch rival Antonio Salieri. This is Salieri's story much more than it is Mozart's. More than anything, the film is a study of the devouring envy one artist can have for the talents of another.F. Murray Abraham is good as Salieri; he has never since gotten as juicy a film role as this. But he's upstaged by Tom Hulce's Mozart, played as a giggling, flamboyant showman who's absolutely oblivious to Salieri's mounting hatred. Indeed, one of the aspects of the rivalry that is most heartbreaking, and which adds fuel to Salieri's fire, is the degree to which Mozart doesn't even recognize Salieri as a rival.Though the movie is meticulous in its period detail, the screenplay is peppered with modern, slangy American dialogue that frees it from the museum piece stuffiness that so often infects other period films.Bravo.Grade: A"

I wasn't a big fan of classical music (still not!) - but I was definitely taken back with this movie.The movie focuses (for the most part) on Salieri - who desires musical greatness (with the help of god) and is maddened by the ""lack of effort"" that fellow composer Mozart exerts while creating heavenly, divine music.This movie is just fantastic - even though I don't like classical music - this film doesn't isolate people like me...  It may be all flashy period-piece - but don't let that put you off - it ain't too snobbish...The deepening obsession with Salieri and the ""deteriorating"" career and health of Mozart is very compelling.

The anger and jealousy that he portrays are truly frightening!  Some of the scenes in this movie   stay with you for a long time.. for instance when Salieri recounts how moved he was when he saw ""The Marriage of Figaro"".. it was so beautifully written! I think his performance was standout like Meryl Streep's in Sophie's Choice. The rest.. the editing... the writing.. the costumes and sets are all wonderful.

daasj1,"Dec 21, 2006",10/10,Movie Review Amadeus was a wonderful about the life of Antonio Salieri and Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and it tell whether Salieri is a murderer. The main characters were played by the phenomenon actor F. Murray Abraham as Antonio Salieri and Tom Hulked who played Mozart. Antonio Salieri was the psycho everyone said in this movie. This movie brought the spectacular music of both Mozart and Salieri. This tale was talented. It started out as old Antonio telling of the life of Mozart while in an asylum. It was a tale of pure talented and jealousy ending in tragedy. This movie was a good movie that director Milos Forman made to inform and also entertain the viewer of the life of such a great composer as Mozart. I give it 4 ½ out of 5 star. Get the DVD or VHS and watch it.
Neil_McCauley1,"May 1, 2007",10/10,"Amadeus represents a humanistic film on the grandest stage. An excellent period drama, the film draws the viewer into Romantic Vienna, cultivator of masterful talents, and home to a foreigner, the young, extremely talented, and quite conceited Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. The film beautifully contrasts Mozart's poor handling of his immense talent with his rival, Antonio Salieri's, contemplations on mediocrity and his attempts to carry out his only wish, to be the mouthpiece for God through his music.Alas, it could not come to fruition for Salieri, as he must sit back and admire the genius of Mozart while at the same time be appalled by his chauvinistic and childish mannerisms. Salieri always acts with composure toward Mozart and never ceases to assist the man in his times of need. Behind the scenes, however, Salieri questions his faith, even burning the cross of Jesus in a powerful scene. The man cannot understand how God could make Mozart the instrument of such musical beauty.The movie Amadeus is the centerpiece for some of the finest music ever put on film. The film's music is a character of its own, always in the background enhancing the action on screen. The film, despite its length, feels like a true journey into the heart of two men driven by music. It is hard to watch Mozart mishandle the great gift that he was given, but it is more painful to watch Salieri unable to move past mediocrity despite all of his attempts.Without question, this is one of the finest films ever crafted. It features amazing performances from the cast, and the script is amazingly adapted by the playwright Peter Shaffer. Its 8 Oscars are duly noted, for Amadeus presents itself on screen like few other films have in history.A powerful example of jealousy, humanity, talent, and music, the film Amadeus serves as an instrument for bringing the genius of Mozart to life and for bringing the real drama of two men's struggles onto the big screen in a very entertaining and emotional way. This film is a masterpiece of cinema, and one of the most deserving 10s I have ever reviewed."
conspracy-2,"Oct 19, 2006",10/10,"Amadeus is in no way the perfect Mozart/Salieri biopic. It takes tremendous liberties with the truth, but that's no matter: it's entertaining and inspiring beyond belief. Mozart's natural musical acumen which Salieri envies so much is portrayed beautifully, and I almost felt myself becoming better at appreciating the highest ideals of music through his descriptions. The scene in which Salieri and Mozart work on getting the Requiem down on paper is the highlight of this side of the film: hearing and understanding the separate layers before hearing them altogether is a goose-bumpingly great experience.And F. Murray Abraham is an astonishing presence in the film. At one point, a rather poor actor playing a doorman comes to the door as Salieri is giving a lesson. The doorman delivers his line flatly, but Abraham's acting, in comparison to that, is incredibly nuanced, natural-looking, well-performed and believable. That's when I discovered that he won that Best Actor Oscar for a very,very good reason indeed."
peacefrogx,"Jul 5, 2005",10/10,"Surely one of the best films of the 1980's, or even perhaps of the last quarter of the 20th century. Everything about this movie, from the complete character foil of Amadeus compared to Salieri, the conflict within conflict storyline of the rise of genius versus the toil of mediocrity, to the ultimate demise of 2 men, one whose talent is consumed by the ravages of alcohol and guilt while the other's soul is consumed by the power of envy. It's the very rare modern day film, with all the trappings of today's film debauchery (language, sex, violence, etc.) that could just as easily have been produced back in the golden age of Hollywood (pre-1950.) F. Murray Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is truly Oscar award worthy. What better way to teach history than to show it through the eyes of the third person in which every step of the title character's role is seen with enough detail as to not confine the character within the facts of histories already known. Yes, as within most Hollywood's rendering of history, there are surely many facts that have been left to the director/screenwriter's interpretation, but then again - this is entertainment, not education.A must see."
funkyfry,"Oct 8, 2002",3/10,"God, why do so many people like this movie?  I mean, I thought it was cool when I was a little kid and I saw it, but other than some cool performances from Hulce and Abraham, what has this movie got to offer?  Excerpts from Mozart's most popular stuff you could buy for $2 on any discount classics CD?  It's got director Forman's usual overuse of head shots and quick reaction shots, his usual reliance on audience reactions to carry the supposed impact of a star's performance (as seen also in his lackluster 90s bioflick, Man on the Moon), plus you've got a whopping case of historical falsification.  The whole thing about Salieri murdering Mozart is ridiculous historical fable that's been passed around by people for years, and has less validity than your average second gunner JFK story.  But viewers of this movie will, unfortunately, probably walk away from it thinking that Salieri was a bad, bad man indeed.  This is unfair to his life and his music, but the producers of this hero-worshipping (though also hero-deflating, in the modern ambigously ""realist"" style) flick couldn't care less.  I guess they just didn't see any other possibility for drama in the tale of the spoiled, brilliant musician and instead of concentrating on his professional laxitude and his obsession with sex (which did get an airing), they came up with the whole Salieri murder thing.  Bad idea, bad movie."
garage5inc,"Nov 6, 2002",N/A,"When the AFI released their 100 Greatest American Films of all time I was rather disappointed to find Amadeus at 53. This movie has the best and brightest set and art direction in cinema. The directing is fabolous, the camera is perfectly placed on every scene and moves exactly as it is supose to. Cinematography hasn't been this grand since The English Patient and Road to Perdition. Amadeus can best be described as a spectacular masterpiece and a must see for any serious film viewer.Amadeus is told through flashbacks by Antonio Saleri (F. Murray Abraham). Saleri was the court composer for Emperor Joseph of Austria during the Renaissance. He is at the top of his game and thanks God for all that he has been given. Emperor Joseph hears about Mozart (Tom Hulce), a musical prodigy that composed and wrote his own operas as young as four years of age. When Mozart comes to Austria to give a private concert, he mocks and completely outshows Saleri. After this we see Saleri sink into depression, enflamed with rage at God, and wanting to kill Mozart to reclaim his glory as the emperor's favorite.During the story we see beautiful operas and plays written and composed by Saleri and Mozart. The visual effects and the sound are absolutely stunning. The pieces that are played just add to the greatness and make it irrestible to look away or take in the music.Mozart was directed by Milos Forman who directed the Oscar winner One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, and later to go on to The People Vs. Larry Flynt, two Oscar wins and one nomination for Best Director. What Forman didn't realize was that he was going to peak Abraham and Hulce's careers, thus putting them out of good work that they absoluetely deserve. Both actors were nominated for Best Actor in 1984, and low and behold Abraham won. Abraham was forced to work in silly action flicks during the 90's including Survivng The Game and Star Trek: Insurrection, and a small role in Finding Forrester. Tom Hulce's career was eradicated. Hulce appeared in nothing major to this date, and remember he was nominated for Best Actor, and by the way he is very talented."
reg-37,"Jan 20, 2003",10/10,"Exceptional adaptation of the Peter Schaffer play. Milos Forman once again shows impeccably craftsmanship with this film, telling of the story of genius composer Mozart through the eyes of mediocrities such as Salieri and ultimately ourselves. Everything in this movie is grand. The music of course, but also the production, the sets and costumes. Top notch acting on all counts seal this as one of the best adaptations ever made. Admittedly, in strict comparison to the play, some important facets of the characters are missing, such as the depth of evil and conflict within Salieri and the sexual tension with Constanza. However, many a classic lines and scenes have been added to make up for it. Entertaining from start to finish, this is a film which will retain its quality for decades to come."
moviola-2,"Jan 31, 1999",10/10,"An extraordinary film. What can I really say that hasn't been said already. It's just wonderful - The cast, the set, the Direction, the music, the screen play adaptation. Everything is just excellent. It's a big ""must"" to see and own for everybody, not just music and good cinema lovers."
Sledgeh101,"Jun 21, 2005",10/10,"If you've never seen this movie before, you may be forgiven for thinking that you're about to watch a biography about Mozart. The truth is that the movie (and the play this movie is based on) take quite a few liberties in trying to make a dramatic point. Just as in other movies about larger-than-life personalities (think ""JFK"" by Oliver Stone, and you get the idea), the point of this is that it's a MOVIE first, and fact second (or possibly further down the line).Having gotten that out of the way, let me also say - IMHO, this is one of the best movies you'll ever see.The movie opens with a 17th century composer, Antonio Salieri, who one night decides to attempt suicide by slashing his wrists. He's soon brought to a mental hospital, and in the morning a young priest comes in to talk to him. He then goes on to discuss the events that brought him to this point - specifically, his jealousy and hatred of Mozart (it's quite amusing to see him perform a few bars of his own music for the priest, to try and get some recognition out of him, and only 'succeeds' when he starts playing Mozart's famous Eine Kleine Nachtmusik - you'll recognize it too when it starts playing).The movie shows in rich detail Mozart's life, primarily starting when Salieri first met him in person at a concert for the Archbishop of Salsburg. What makes Salieri burn is that Mozart appears to be a ""filthy, dirty creature"" with a foul mind - and that his music seems to come directly out of Mozart's head, ""without corrections of any kind"". During the course of the movie, Salieri's anger and jealousy start to consume him, until he devises a plot to 'kill' Mozart and get his revenge on God (the anger in old Salieri's eyes, and the fear in the priest's, make that scene the most powerful one for me).Besides the beautiful music of Mozart that fills the movie, one of the things that makes this movie work so well is how they made 17th century Vienna look authentic, giving you a feel of what life must have been like back then (of course, some of the stuff was probably also enhanced by the people making this movie, but you'd be hard pressed to point out any problems). My favorite 'play within the movie' has to be where Salieri is watching Mozart's version of Don Giovani. Besides the haunting music and wonderful singing, it's the attention to detail - including 'demons' swirling around with lit torches - that really make this movie stand out.Regardless of what type of movie you normally would watch - action, comedy, horror, whatever - I urge you to watch this movie at least once. You'll be better off for having done so."
movieman9,"Sep 6, 1998",9/10,"AMADEUS is a triumph in delivering a biography without the frills, all feeling and spirit, and no excessive druggie depression. F. Murray Abraham received a well-deserved Oscar for the role of the jealousy-ridden Salieri, with Tom Hulce in his finest role to date as the brilliant but childish Mozart. What is truly great about this ""music-bio""  is that there is no real hero to this story. Every character has the right to be hated or cheered for. Instead of glib facts, AMADEUS relies on human emotions to tell its tale, relating it with style, humour, mystery, and astonishment. This is truly one of the best films of 1984."
slokes,"Jul 25, 2004",10/10,"""Amadeus"" cleaned up on Oscar Night, 1985, and in its time was as much an event as a film. It even spawned a #1 worldwide hit, the silly but infectious ""Rock Me Amadeus."" Then the movie kind of disappeared. You didn't hear about it much when people discussed great cinema, even from the 1980s. The actors, all hailed when the film came out, seemed to slip back into relative obscurity, except for Cynthia Nixon, the future ""Sex And The City"" girl unrecognizable here as an innocent housemaid. Maybe that's why director Milos Forman and the film's producers decided on releasing a special Director's Cut when it was time to make a DVD.The result, as Salieri might have put it, is breathtaking. The film breathes with new life, shaking whatever period-film shackles held it back in 1984. We see Mozart struggling to make himself an instructor for rich, untalented girls; enjoy with the common people of Austria a rousing farce of ""Don Giovanni;"" and finally get a satisfying reason for one of the original film's few problems: Why Mozart's wife Constanze angrily sends Salieri away from her husband's deathbed. The end result: What was great before is perfection now.Its brilliance is not in its costumes, its set design, its bravura performances or crafty plot. It's not even the music, though classical-music snobs I encountered claimed that was the only thing in the movie worth noticing, though in its hacked-up state it was more ""Hooked On Mozart"" than anything truly edifying. No, what's great about ""Amadeus,"" what makes it rise to the utter top, is how all these brilliant elements are brought together in a way that carries the viewer with it from beginning to end. Even if you don't get it all the first time you see it, your appetite will be stoked enough for you to wish to see it again, and that's where the film really makes it mark.Like other landmark movies, ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Psycho,"" ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" and ""Jaws,"" ""Amadeus"" hits you a different way each time you see it. It's gripping tragedy, a sad love story, and in parts very funny, sometimes broadly so, like when the midget pantomimes Don Giovanni's entrance in the vaudeville show, or more subtly. Salieri is especially rich in this regard, the way F. Murray Abraham plays him. There's a great scene when he connives to sabotage a Mozart opera, only to have the Emperor arrive and undo his work in such a way to make Mozart think Salieri has in fact done him a great service. Mozart bows meaningfully in Salieri's direction, and Abraham's pained courtliness in his response is a sturdy laugh every time I see it.Abraham won an Oscar for his role, and deserved it, but there's great acting all over the place. Tom Hulce makes Mozart a high-living fellow with a juvenile mind and a poor understanding for the lesser talents of other composers, yet at the same time he makes you care about his many trials. Elizabeth Berridge is believably coquettish and lower-class as Constanze, and the Director's Cut really makes you better appreciate what a great actress she was and how unfair it was we never got to see her in another film this good. Jeffrey Jones provides much of the comedy as a Reaganesque Emperor Joseph, good-naturedly opaque, and there's a wonderful bevy of stock characters lurking in the background who all get their turns in the sun, like in a Shakespeare play.That's a good way to describe ""Amadeus,"" as the kind of film Shakespeare might have made had he plied his trade a few centuries later. The central theme involves one of those classic problems of life, of how one copes with the gift of being able to discern another's greatness without being able to produce the same in return, but there's a wonderful metaphysical mystery underneath, too, the kind W.S. did so well.Is this a film about the folly of seeing a religious design in the patterns of life, in thinking some divine being guides all and decides who is great and who is not? Some would say so. Others might incline to Salieri's own belief, that God is a being not of mercy but of caprice, striving to undo those who strive to be better than He intends. Finally, there is the idea, which I go with, that Salieri's great loss was not in being there when Mozart came to Vienna but to be so choked with jealousy as to not help him, despite the many opportunities to do so, and to suffer the consequences of seeing Mozart's posthumous reputation rise to greater heights while his own music ""grows fainter."" The brilliance of that last scene, of Salieri helping Mozart write the Requiem, is realizing that with a different, more positive and truly pious outlook, Salieri could have been Mozart's champion, and shared some of his boundless fame.Of course, this is all fiction. Salieri didn't drive Mozart to his death. Ironically, he was more a devoted servant of greatness, as history records him being the chief teacher of the one composer whose reputation arguably eclipses even Mozart's, Ludwig van Beethoven.But screenwriter Peter Shaffer doesn't let this get in the way of a great story, and so we have a great movie, and Salieri, a measure of notoriety his own music never brought."
Nick-153,"Jan 20, 1999",10/10,"This film is truly a work of art. The interweaved plot of actual history and fiction spun into a masterpeice! You need not be knowledgeable of classical music to enjoy this film, but must be able to tolerate it, as the music underscores the entire film.Stunning performances given by F. Murry Abraham and Thomas Hulce deliver, in my eyes, one of the 10 best films of all time!"
frankde-jong,"Jul 20, 2024",7/10,"As the name already suggests ""Amadeus"" is a biopic, but it is a special biopic.In the first place it is a biopic about a composer of classical music. Not the hero of the average moviegoer! However a beautiful soundtrack is guaranteed.In the second place the story is told through the eyes of the arch enemy of Mozart, Antonio Salieri, ""Kapellmesiter"" at the Habsburg court. The plot of the film is incidentally based on a play by the Russian poet Alexander Pushkin.In the third place the character of Mozart (Tom Hulce) is portrayed as a rather vulgar rascal. Only notice his hysterical laugh! Not the type we think of imagining a composer of classical music. In the film Mozart even acknowledges his shortcomnings himself in a conversation with the King: ""I'm a vulgar man, your Excellancy. But my music isn't."". In this respect it must be kept in mind however that the story is told by his arch enemy!A year after the release of the movie the Austrian singer Falco reinforced this rebel image by portraying Mozart as the popstar of his time (""Rock me Amadeus"").Towards the end of the film all this frivolity is gone. Mozart is composing his ""Requiem"" while is health is detoriorating. This part if the film reminded me of the Edgar Allen Poe story ""The fall of the house of Usher"" (already adapted to film by Jean Epstein in 1928) were a piece of art drains all life out of a human being."
sashank_kini-1,"Feb 3, 2012",6/10,"Give something that rhymes with Mozart and a kid today would say ""Old Fart!"" since Mozart is only reserved for those high-brow, supercilious opera-lovers who feign to appreciate actual music. Well, many people do pretend to be connoisseurs of art, but there are a few who can actually find a communion with music. One of them was Antonio Salieri, a decent composer but a brilliant connoisseur of music. To him, as he said it himself, Mozart was 'the voice of God', and Salieri could actually understand the genius' thought process behind writing the music. How would this man of extraordinary skills be of character? Would he silent the entire audience with his eloquence and profoundness, outside his music, as a person?In 'Amadeus', Salieri gets his answer; if the true Mozart were like this, which is highly unlikely, then he would think of these high-brows as 'dlo trafs!'. In fact, Mozart, in Amadeus, is a prodigy in music who never takes anything seriously. Salieri wonders how such a creature could possess such genius; he feels God has purposely avenged Salieri by bestowing upon him average talents while handing Mozart infinite capabilities. As a lunatic in his old age in an asylum, Salieri narrates his life to a priest. In the amusing scene, Salieri plays two of his compositions to the priest and asks them to guess the name of the song, but the priest isn't able to. Then he plays a very familiar tune and the priest immediately recognizes the tunes. Salieri sighs, and slowly tells him that it was 'not' his work, it was Mozart's. It does not come as a surprise here: when I type Mozart in Word document, I get no spell error, but the moment I type Salieri, it is underlined in red!Poor Salieri believes he has killed Mozart, and tells the priest about his lifelong dream to be a great composer and his contempt towards Mozart, the person while reverence towards Mozart's music. Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fiendish, vulgar, lascivious and crude genius who later shows his soft side while Salieri is a passionate, soft-spoken Italian who then becomes two-faced, contemptuous, and monomaniacal and later lunatic. Mozart and his wife struggle to earn money while get fame and respect, while Salieri gets money and fame but struggles to earn talent. For Salieri, it is an internal defeat and hence he tries to bring down Mozart in whichever way possible while wholeheartedly lauding his music.Much of the film is shown from the viewpoint of Salieri, but then shifts to Mozart's own personal life and hardships. The maid has been thoughtfully kept so that Salieri is able to tell from Mozart's point of view, in case some would be wondering how Salieri knew so much about Mozart's personal life. When Salieri tells about his first experience with Mozart, where the latter is shamelessly caressing his lover under the table in the palace, Mozart plays by telling his lover then wife, Constanze to guess the words spoken by him backwards, then speaks all lewd words. It does feel out-of-place hearing some of the lines here, especially 'eat my s**t' and 'kiss my a**' but nevertheless funny. The scenes with the Count in the palace are absolute bananas, especially to observe the stark contrast between Mozart and the others. Even Salieri's constant plotting is very interesting and enjoyable, especially his most knavish act with Constanze.'Amadeus', however, fails to provide a thorough justification to its initial build-up. We know how Salieri loved Mozart's music but hated Mozart himself but the moment Salieri's role diminishes and the focus shifts to Mozart, it is difficult to actually sympathize with Salieri's guilt. It is a very common phenomenon, like if we have one actor playing a character for a period of time and then another actor takes his/her place and the audience feels a bit alienated. Also, Tom Hulce gave his Mozart a one-dimensional comic book quality that showed him throughout the 160 minutes of the film as a person of mediocre talents except when playing in those operas in the theater. It is almost impossible to believe that this Mozart was so profound, and 'Figaro' and 'Requiem' were his compositions. I'm not saying that an artist has to have that aura always; I have foul-mouthed, alcoholic, erratic friends who are good actors/musicians/composers/businessmen but these people had a certain quality in them that I could associate with their talent. And this erratic Mozart should have had that quality in him throughout the movie which could make me believe that he was the Mozart indeed. And the incongruous accent doesn't help either.Salieri is played beautifully by F. Murray Abraham; his effectively gives his character the shiftiness while advising Mozart and honestly while praising his music. But I found the climactic scene between the two characters to be somewhat underwhelming; I know it was difficult to execute, but it still had to have so many more emotions stirring up in such circumstances. This also wore off the effect of the grand catharsis, which is similar but not as effective as the endings in Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove' or 'A Clockwork Orange'. Much of this I find fault with Tom Hulce's sterile performance.Out of the supporting characters, only Jeffrey Jones truly succeeded in playing his character with the right comedic seriousness. Elizabeth Berridge was competent but inconsistent, her accent not helping much either. The only turkey, according to me, was Simon Callow and the c-word was completely unnecessary in the movie. The music itself was brilliantly performed, all of them. One could see the faults with Salieri's congested arrangements and feel the depth of Mozart's compositions, especially in the requiem for his father. And I discovered that these compositions did have words- I was dumb enough to think these singers were warbling just notes, no words!"
rusoviet,"Jan 3, 2019",1/10,I was assuming this would be a study of the composer that was focused on his music - instead what I got was 'Animal House' antics by the main character - Mozart. It seems this film was from the 1970's directors mindset of Altman or Mazursky....if a critical insightful scene can be turned into slapstick then full speed ahead. As another reviewer stated save for F. Murray Abraham there wasn't another actor or actress worth a darn in this mess..Mozart was a genius and also had deep faith as noted by his final compositions - you'd never know it by this pathetic biopic just as the powers that be omitted in their biopic of Dutch Shultz in 'Billy Bathgate' his (Schultz) pleading to have someone get him a Catholic Priest to baptize and hear his confession before he died in Newark-NJ. His wish was fulfilled but Hollywood made sure that troubling fact wasn't included.
mozartdesklamp,"Feb 23, 2007",10/10,"Of all the many films known to me, Amadeus is the greatest. Most would say that this is a bold statement given the utterly unfathomable number of marvelous movies that have been created throughout the world; once you recognize the genius of the man behind the music, though, it becomes much clearer. Whether you first saw Amadeus in 1984 and many times since or are watching it for the first time, you're fascination with Mozart, his life and music will only be enhanced. Even if you have no interest in classical music, the passions of this film will reach every emotion. This film is a must see for all... truly a 'triumph deluxe!'"
etg1701,"Jul 28, 2006",10/10,"In today's pop-fixated culture, it's easy to forget that the techniques of harmony, musicianship, and so on were invented hundreds of years ago by the classical musicians. Unfortunately, I would say by now that classical music has all but become the real alternative music these days given its minority popularity. As such, I was quite pleased to see a film about Mozart and his rivals in the world of music.It goes without saying that the film has a great soundtrack featuring many of Mozart's best loved works. It also manages to be dramatic without being too heavy. Salieri's angst balances with Mozart's silliness to keep things both entertaining, even humorous, while dealing with a dark plot of unfulfilled dreams, growing madness, and tragedy. All in all, a great film and a reminder of a time before Elvis was king."
gaystereotype,"Nov 3, 2002",9/10,"This was the most enjoyable movie about classical music for me, a classical musician.  In addition to respecting the music itself, the characters were also 3-dimensional.  Immortal Beloved and Impromptu were totally cheeseball compared to this great movie"
Straight,"Apr 26, 1999",10/10,"I can recall no other movie employing music, especially classical music, so cleverly.Until 1984 I cared for only `classical' classical music, such as the 1812 Overture and Swan Lake.  But seeing Amadeus immediately piqued my interest in all classical music through its unique use of Mozart's music as not only a part of the plot, but also as theme music for each scene.Amadeus so moved me that I have read several books on Mozart's life.  I learned that Salieri once claimed he had killed Mozart.  However, he quickly recanted this.  Therefore, Amadeus is strictly fiction.  Once one recognizes that, he may enjoy the movie more as an entertainment than a biography, which it definitely is not.In fact, there are many theories as to how Mozart died.  One book even suggests that his wife, Constanze, poisoned him!  It is more likely, however, that he died of `natural causes,' which in 1999 could have been easily cured.Whatever the cause of Mozart's death, and whatever his personality might have been, Mozart's music is THE standard for all other classical composers. There will never be another like him.  And Amadeus gets this point across to people who aren't initially classical music fans.If this movie isn't a 10, there aren't any 10s out there!"
cheeze71,"Jan 29, 2002",10/10,"Before seeing ""Amadeus"" I expected it to be a boring movie, but wow! I was captured immediately from the starting scene of the movie. I like this movie so much because it gives me strong feelings. I think everybody who has a passion on something and want to work in the same field can somehow identify with Salieri... When you try v. hard to improve but what you achieve is work, not art; but others know exactly how to create perfection. They can't tell you how they make it but bong! there comes a piece of great art.The movie is so good that the characters give me strong feelings. I pity Salieri but dislike him for not being content with his own talent.My heart ached in the scene when Salieri was conducting his own opera (the one he invited Mozart to see). He was passionate in his work & he was soo happy when he heard the applause and when he's praised by the Emperor. Another person may already be content in his position but Salieri tortured himself so much by his jealousy. He ruined his own life. This character gives me so much mixed emotions. Both Salieri & Mozart give me mixed feelings. They can be lovable, hateful & pitiful AT THE SAME TIME! (the portray that Salieri loves dessert & the happiness he shows when he's praised give him a lovable side in his character) btw, the scene when Salieri helped Mozart to write down his music is v. successful to give me strong, mixed emotions. The pity for both of them, & the strange relationship % them. (think about how Mozart perceives Salieri )"
Segovia,"Aug 24, 1999",9/10,"I have seen this movie 6 or 7 times. I really liked it. Although there is some facts that they didn't happen in real life and Mozart wasn't too ""crazy"", I think the picture shows the genius behind ""the vulgar man"" as he called himself. That scenes when he writes his music are simply magnificent. The music inside his mind and he just writes it. Then how he is describing his own music. By the other side, there is no shown any pupil working with him. I know that wasn't the purpose of the director (Milos Forman), but it would be interesting at least if one of his pupils had appeared. That who finished the Requiem. But anyway, this picture is one of the best biographical pictures I have ever seen. Not for the facts but for how it is showing a ""GENIUS AT WORK"""
revelation59,"Dec 12, 2006",7/10,"I think this bit of history is the tragedy of the Roman Catholic church as well as some more recent Christian churches in America that have lost the meaning of the word GRACE. Mozart (Amadeus) was one of the greatest classical music composers of all time. Yet he was murdered through the use of psychology by a crafty satanic jealous Catholic priest-Salieri. He could not see how God could give such a great musical gift to a man who he perceived as being toally immoral! Salieri denied the Christina faith and sold his soul to Satan like Dracula in the movie BRAM STOKER'S Dracula! Some of the world's most evil people are connected to the church! As witness to what manipuLators clergy are and were, the chess opening, The Ruy Lopez, was invented by a Spanish Bishop of the same name!So, I really think I benefit from not being accepted in church. And I think I have some evil Salieri in my own life, some smug self-righteous religious jerk who tries to destroy my life as well. And as the movie ends, the point I also see is that at the end of even a great historical life, the Grim Reaper comes for you and they wrap your body in a shroud, throw you in a hole and cover you up with dirt!

Could it have been any more annoying?  I'm sure that's what Milos Forman was going for, but a little too annoying if you ask me.I must admit that I'm a bit surprised this film won an Oscar for Best Picture, sure it was good, but Best Picture?  Well, ok, I guess so.  I was also VERY surprised that the F. Murray Abraham won an Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role.  I thought he did a fine job, don't get me wrong, but I didn't find his acting to anything Oscar worthy.If you're into classical music, then you should most definitely see this film.  I wouldn't recommend this film to anyone that can't sit through a film more than 2 hours long and isn't into films of this type.

StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 19, 2005",N/A,"Completely fictionalized film about Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart the great composer.Mozart is played as a complete buffoon by Tom Hulce who must have thought he was still acting in Animal House. Peter Shaffer's play is not based at all upon the life of Mozart. The depiction of Mozart as such an idiot is a travesty. It's too bad people watch this film and think this is the way Mozart was. He wasn't.F. Murray Abraham plays Antonio Solierie, the now forgotten contemporary composer of Mozart who envied and admired him. He is also completely wrong historically.The only things accurate about the film are the costumes and the music so for those reasons it's recommended. Mozart's' great music will maybe gain new admirers through this film."
pauleskridge,"May 21, 2024",8/10,"Eight stars. Because, damn, that was bleak! My guess is that the actual
Mozart wasn't quite the idiot-savante that Tom Hulce played him as. But I've
known enough really brilliant people to know that the mix of arrogance and
naivete he portrayed was likely reality. Still, the film belongs to Murray
Abraham. He won that Oscar fair and square. The only real competition was
Albert Finney (I haven't seen Starman). Salieri had to be believable not only
as a villain, but as a man of talent, and of deep love for music. Otherwise
all his Machiavellian manipulations would just seem pointless. I don't know
how much the film makes up its story, but the fundamental lesson is that real
genius cannot be stamped out. Mozart died while still a young man, and is the
only one of the characters than any one remembers now. I don't know if Salieri
was really a villain, or just a by-stander whos light was drowned out by the
genius he found near him. But I do know that Abraham played a part for the
ages. The only other cast members that stood out to me were Elizabeth
Berridge, who began as window-dressing, but got stronger and stronger as the
film progressed, and Jeffrey Jones (one of the only other actors I recognized).Every now and again, I realize that there are still some stone classics that I
haven't gotten around to watching yet. This was one, and was three hours very
well spent! 14 May 2024."
simba-18,"Sep 30, 1999",10/10,"I love this movie and watch it every few months.  It is awesome and must be viewed with surround sound for the full effect.The story is compelling in the way it is told from Salieri's point of view. Salieri is an adequate composer in Vienna held in high position in the court of Emporer Joseph(Jeffrey Jones). But when Mozart arrives from Salzburg, suddenly Salieri feels threatened. Right away Salieri's image of what Mozart might be like is blown- seeing him ""rolling on the floor"" playing a childlike sex game with his future wife, Constanze. Mozart inadvertently insults Salieri at a meeting with the emperor and all the court composers so from that point on  Salieri is driven to revenge by jealousy and envy of his talent, which he hails, ""music already finished in his head, as if he were taking dictation.  Then I knew, this was no performing monkey, this was the voice of God, coming through this infantile buffoon of a man"".  (These quotes are not exactly verbatim, but you get the jist of it). This a well spent 158 minutes.  Although this is not an actual biography on Mozart, which was not the intention of Peter Schaffer or Milos Forman. The point that I derived from this film is the fact that society never appreciates true genius while they are in the present.  Mediocrity will be hailed in the present, but the true genius will be shunned (and you can see that fact true to this day).  That point is driven home as ""Amadeus"" comes to a close when you see Salieri being wheeled into the mental hospital claiming to be the patron saint of mediocrity while in the background, you hear Mozart's giggle, having the last laugh at all his rivals, in that his music will live on forever. I feel that not only did F. Murray Abraham deserve the Best Actor Award by the Academy,  I wish that Tom Hulce could have gotten it also.  It should have been impossible to exclude one, both performances played off each other perfectly."
Spuzzlightyear,"Sep 24, 2005",9/10,"I've seen Amadeus exactly twice now. Let's see, the first time I saw it was back in 1985 That was back when I was 16. I remember it being sort of boring, not exactly my type of movie. (If I recall, my parents didn't think it was so hot either). Well, 20 years later, I've watched this again, and my god, this is such a great and beautiful movie! The story essentially follows the last years of Mozart's young life, and his on again / off again feud with a rival composer, Salieri. Through the composition of several operas, including Figaro and the Death March, Mozart realizes that ambition can sometimes overwhelm the soul.F. Murray Abraham as Salieri and Tom Hulce as Mozart! Both are brilliant here, both deserved the academy award, but only Abraham got it. I DO like Hulce better. He's just simply amazing here. He really hasn't done anything since that closely resembles his performance here. The rest of the cast is great, including a real scene-stealer role from Jeffery Jones. He was known for his silly comedies, and this role was great to exposing audiences to another side of himself. (Oh, I could say something else here, but that would be too obvious).The costuming, decor and time period staging is done just so, but what really gets me, that this is one of the very few movies I've seen taking place in this time period that has a sense of humor about itself. I mean everyone doesn't seem to walking with a ruler down their backside, and it totally looks that living in this time period would have been, you know, fun!"
gaetanbac,"Sep 30, 2003",9/10,"I first saw the movie when I was around 8 years old. An old tape on which we taped over later. But I still remember the emotion I had at that time.Since then I have seen the movie again and I must say that I am every time delighted since the emotion is intact. The play it is based on invents this rivalry between these two passionate music lovers and brings a canvas of love, hate, respect, betrayal and magic.Milos Forman brings here a vision of the play in its most superb aspects such as the scenes extracted from several operas. Everyone will, after seeing this movie, remember the two main actors (F. Murray Abraham and Tom Hulce) but on my part the acting of the others have much to do with the quality of the movie such as the priest (Richard Frank), the father (Roy Dotrice), the emperor Joseph (Jeffrey Jones) and last but not least: Constanze (Elizabeth Berridge).Great movie, I never get tired of watching it My grade: 10/10"
kdmcqueen,"Feb 27, 2000",10/10,"What better way to portray one of the best minds of our time, than as a lunatic whos rival drives him to his demise?  In my opinion there is none and no one but Milos Forman can do it perfectly.  The actors are wonderful, and the movie is beautiful. It's a treat to watch anytime."
Quintana1-1,"Apr 9, 2006",10/10,"A movie with the kind of reputation Amadeus has can, sometimes, not live up to the hype. This is not the case with Amadeus. The movie is a brilliant work of art. Everything seems to fit in the movie, the acting, the sets, the costumes, the writing, and of course the music. Tom Hulce does a great job playing Mozart, but F. Murray Abraham stole the show. At some moments in the movie you find yourself hating Salieri but in the next you can't help sympathize with him. I went in to the movie with the high expectations of seeing a piece of brilliance put upon by critics, friends, teachers, and siblings. After seeing the movie I find it hard to disagree. If asked ""what did you think of Amadeus?"" I can simply and honestly answer ""One of the best of all time."""
ultra-theos,"Feb 7, 2012",3/10,"I re-watched AMADEUS recently for the first time in over twenty years and, I must say, it is pretty terrible. The characters have about as much depth as those found in Coen brothers' films; the whole Mozart-Salieri is nearly totally fictional; the sordid, soap-operish (no pun intended) relationships between virtually every character are pure Hollywood pap but most importantly (and offensively), there is NO historical basis on which to portray Mozart as an over-sexed, philandering drunkard who took nothing seriously other than his own fame. Yes, I know a couple of pornographic-songs-as-bad-jokes were found in Mozart's notebooks but, beyond that, all evidence points to the fact ol' Wolfgang was ever the faithful husband (not to mention a deeply devout Christian, as well). And where did the writer come up with this idea that Mozart hated and was rebelling against Italian opera? If it weren't so prominent in the film I wouldn't take issue with it but, once again, it is completely historically inaccurate. Mozart idolized and emulated Italian opera composers and his sense of melody is equally rooted in that genre as in the German masters of his youth. In other words, the Mozart in the movie isn't even a caricature but, rather, a complete invention. Historic bone-picking aside, even if this tale were completely fictional and there was no historical figure called ""Mozart"", the movie is just awful. The corny make-up of the aging Salieri, the acting of virtually every character other than Tom Hulce's Wolfie (which is not to contradict myself, it is admittedly a good performance), the cardboard cut-out characters and melodramatic direction all add up to create a near total artistic failure.What's that sound I hear... oh yes... it's old Wolfgang turning in his grave."
mermatt,"Aug 1, 1998",N/A,"No character other than Captain Ahab in MOBY DICK comes close to the obsessive, egotistic, insanely jealous Salieri. The music is wonderful, the sets and costumes are grand, but the performances are what really makes this the powerful film that it is.Slowly we are drawn into old Salieri's madness until we at last understand why he did what he did -- but by that time, we see what a patheic creature he is. He is, as he himself says, the ""patron saint of mediocrity."" His insane anger against God causes him to destroy himself -- and yet, he is allowed to live in order to see his own destruction. That is the real horror of the story."
lee-214,"Jun 8, 2003",8/10,"You have to hand it to Milos Forman, he really knows how to thrash out human experience on screen. With wonderful movies such as One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest, The People Vs. Larry Flynt and Man On The Moon under his belt he truly is one of cinema's finest biographers. Amadeus is a curious movie, for a multiple oscar winner its rarely mentioned among peoples 'top lists'. Stanger still is the fact that its leading actors F. Murray Abraham(Salieri) and Tom Hulce(Mozart) never really achieved much in Hollywood following the success of Amadeus. A shame really as those who've watched it will know:Amadeus takes an objective view of the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart by having Viennese Court Composer, Antonio Salieri narrate the tale. Salieri reveals his part in Mozart's demise and illustrates his legendary hatred for Mozart throughout the film. Yet underneath Salieri's hatred lies an admiration for Mozart's talent that stretches to adoration for Mozart's music. These conflicting emotions cause Salieri to conjure a fascinating portrayal of Mozart and his talent for the audience - Criticisms of the movie mainly revolve around the historical inaccuracies and the portrayal of Mozart himself....to these people I  say that all history is open to interpretation and that the movie itself is told from the perspective of Salieri(of whom little is actually known) who, for the purposes of the movie, resented the success and lifestyle enjoyed by Mozart - F. Murray Abraham's performance as Salieri was majestic, with his awe-stricken voice retaining an authoritative weight throughout the picture. Hulce is well cast as the giggling, and often arrogant young Mozart. Set largly in decorative opera halls and Royal Courts the sets are among the most lavish to hit film and are accompanied on screen by (inevitably) a glorious classical score(so make sure to turn up the volume) giving the audience a wonderful cinematic experience, both visually and aurally. Worth a look."
metrevej,"Apr 9, 2001",10/10,"I would like to join a large group of people praising the movie and say that it is one of the best films ever made. Everything is of highest standards in the film: plot, photography, choreography,music, acting etc. It is that rare case, when the words are not capable of expressing all the scale and beauty of the film. You have to see it, then to ponder on it, again to see it and so on. This is a real art: refined, elevated and human,inciting to fall to thinking, meanwhile giving an immense pleasure.Milos Forman, who I consider as one of the greatest movie directors of all time and with whom you have the highest possible chance to see a new masterpiece, has done an outstanding job. The film is not about music and the two composers, and therefore, can not pretend to be historically accurate (although I don't think it's far away from what was real). The film is about a genius and mediocrity, and their relationship. The film raises a question: why is that from the birth it is decided whether a man will be a genius or not. Further actions, the way of leaving, as well as personal characteristics, positive or negative, are less important. Forman masterly examines the human foibles, revealed in extreme conditions, and we start sympathizing with Salieri: it is even difficult to determine on whose side the director is. We support and like genius, but what we can do if the most part of the world is populated by the mediocre (ordinary) people? and in the final scene Salieri absolves the asylum inmates -and not only them- from the sin of mediocrity.Amadeus is a brilliant piece of the real art, shining out in twilights of today's depreciated art, including the cinematography."
mig28lx,"Sep 14, 2000",10/10,"This is one of those movies I can watch again and again and still be enthralled, mystified, and amazed every time.  I admit I may be biased because I am a lover of classical music, but I am also a lover of great cinema, and this is one of the greatest examples of modern cinema.  I may be biased also because, like Salieri, I too can recognize genius in music, acting, and even writing, and I sometimes grow envious and bitter as I watch undeserving hacks grow rich while the only way I can get published is to write little comments for IMDb.There is so much I could say about the underlying truths in this film about the disparity between those of us who struggle to reach above-average status and those who reach superstar-status without breaking a sweat.  But I won't. Chances are not a lot of people will read this review that necessarily care about that aspect of the film.  This is not a slam on fellow members; you wouldn't have become a member if you didn't care about good film.  But many of my views are so personal I can't express them without losing my objectivity.

mary-closson45,"Sep 7, 2024",8/10,"Great film. In this director's version, we find out more than we had before about this. Scenes of him quietly praying but at the same time crying out to God to help him have as great a gift as Mozart.Every failure and snub he receives in his life, from the arrival of the young genius culminates in his declaring God his enemy and burning the Holy Cross in the fireplace. The new scenes help build it to a better climax on that note.Along with this the expanded story of when Mozrt's wife secretly visits Salieri to show her husband's work to him,to gain a paid teaching post. This leads to the deleted section of Salieri telling her to ""come back in the evening"" , for illicit purposes.Once she later arrives and removes her top garment exposing herself,for whatever reason, he decides to instead have her shown out the door. I'm assuming out of his own sense of decency, he decided not to go through with it. It's Mozart he wants to punish, not her. Even though he has just the same."
Jim B-2,"Aug 10, 1999",10/10,"As a biography, the detractors are right. This film is only a 5 on that scale. But IMDb says the genre is Drama. I disagree. But if they are right then this flick is only a 7. And it is that high only because of the magnificent portrayal of the jealous Salieri by F. Murray Abraham. He has redefined Jealousy to include non-sexual jealousy, something Hollywood had forgotten. So classic was this rendition that Bill Buckley now calls Liberalism ""Salieri's Disease."" Once you see the picture you will understand the reference to wanting to destroy those who are more productive or talented. But the true genre is Musical. And the rating there is a 10, although the score is not reflective of the scope or the best of Mozart's compositions. Even so, this is Mozart. That makes the film a 10, and one worth seeing over and over and over!"
haridam0,"Oct 1, 2007",6/10,". . . That's the way the Director's Cut struck me. Simply too much of a good thing, especially toward the end when the drama should be nearing its wrap up. We have extraneous scenes that only confuse momentum toward a dramatic finale.As for the film itself, it seems fundamentally skewed, with the author taking what appears little more that a footnote in a Mozart bio, and blowing it up to enormous proportions. The result is long on entertainment, short on history.Some films benefit from director's cuts; Amadeus does not. Fortunately, the studio cut version remains the better choice."
albechri,"May 22, 2000",10/10,"Imperfection and unknown deceit.We are struck with truthful in humanity by this movie. We see Mozart in his lust, ego, self-love, and horse-laugh. We see him as a person.I cannot tell more, the movie is too beautiful to be written in words. You must see if with your heart and feel the beauty of it.Like the way you listen to Amadeus composition. A perfect combination of each instrument, creating a monumental piece of work. And Milos Forman had done it perfectly.The casts are perfect, the story is strong, the music is charming, and the messages are crystal clear.A must see for everyone."
Sergeant-4,"Oct 3, 2000",6/10,"Milos Forman did a good job, but a lot of his efforts are leading into an empty space. Abraham and Hulce do their best, and Mozart is no longer a mysterium, but a lot of things are forgotten after a short time. Art direction and costume design are outstanding, but it is not enough for such a great picture, as it is acclaimed to be. Six points - no more - no less."

vvgoff,"Jun 5, 2002",N/A,"I saw this movie when it first came out in 1984.  It is gorgeous, except for the introduction of evil in the persona of Salieri.  I was subsequently appalled to learn that this was a complete fabrication; the real Salieri was a colleague of Mozart's and was not the jealous, evil villain portrayed in the movie.  That entire plot device was artistic license to artificially dramatize the story; doing so at the expense of a real person's (living or deceased) reputation is unacceptable.  How much more I would have admired Peter Shaffer if he had not resorted to this gimmick and trashed a man's reputation in the process, especially a man who is no longer alive to defend himself."
HAL9000-16,"Jun 25, 1999",10/10,"In what I consider to be the fourth greatest film of all time. An unknown musical composer named Antonio Salieri, who is now in an asylum for trying to cut his throat, confesses to a priest that he was behind the murder of the greatest composer who ever walked the face of the Earth, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.Amadeus is nothing shy of a miraculous film. Oscar nominee Tom Hulce gives the greatest performance of his career as Mozart, the childish, immature brat that God chose to be the greatest musical composer ever. Hulce gives so much light to the screen annoying the hell out of everyone around him, especially F. Murray Abraham, (who overshadows Hulce with an Oscar winning performance) who plays Antonio Salieri, a mediocre composer who went insane with jealousy against Mozart for his God-given gift. Salieri, who is now comsumed by hatred and sorrow, swears vengeance on Mozart, and even God Himself.The film Amadeus, is like Mozart's music itself, miraculous. Tom Hulce and Oscar winner F. Murray Abraham add so much dramatic intensity to the 2 1/2 hr. film that it never seems half that long. You have to see it to really know what I'm talking about, but it is certainly well worth the time. In my opinion, there are only three other films the are better than Amadeus, (2001: A Space Odyssey, The Godfather, and Star Wars)"
THX 1138,"Jan 9, 2002",9/10,"Amadeus is a great movie and gains in quality after repeated viewing. It's right up there in my top ten list. Why historically inaccurate? Well, I am a big Mozart fan and I've read all the published letters he wrote to his father. Believe me, if Mozart had a disliking to someone, he'd mention it to his father without having reservations. If Mozart ever mentions Salieri in his letters, he refers to him as his colleague and doesn't have one nasty thing to say about him. Salieri never commissioned or helped Mozart with the Requiem score nor did he poisoned him (which also has been rumored) nor did he work him to death. I feel sorry for Salieri because he himself had only nice things to say about his colleagues. I think he deserves better and wonder why he's being portrayed as such a villain. (Bad enough for him no one knows his music...) By the way: Mozart's outrageous giggle which everyone loved and was the onset of an imitation-contest in Italy was ""made in Hollywood"". If the makers of Amadeus would have read the letters he wrote to his wife and niece, they could have dispensed with the fabricated intrigues and use factual material that would make Milos Forman's Mozart look like a choirboy. But hey: I still love to watch this movie, even for the umph-th time! Thanks Milos!"
knows_film,"Jun 30, 2007",10/10,"Amadeus is one of my all time unsurpassed movies.It's a biopic on Mozart. In terms of plot however it does not play like a biopic. The story is about as faithful to Mozart Amadeus Wolfgang as Forrest Gump was to Forrest Gump. Mozart in Amadeus is a drunken buffoon whose music talent comes so naturally it's merely something he does between scenes for shits and giggles. The real story is how green with jelly the films narrator gets. He hates Mozart yet we rely on him to tell us the story. At any minute during the film you expect the narrator to have a fit of jealousy and stop narrating. On the contrary it never happens because the narrator is a student of music. He loves Mozart's music as do we. This only further exasperates how jealous of Mozart he must be which in turn reinforces how funny it is.I love this film for its humor, for its music and most of all for its epic depiction of envy. No film or medium better encapsulates the essence of envy than what is presented to us in Amadeus in the form of Salieri."

I'm sorry, but nice photography and good sets & costumes don't make a movie. Although the acting is quite good here, it can't save this badly written movie. The script is completely at fault: it is incoherent and contains a really disappointing ending. How it ever won an Oscar, I will never know."
randyk,"Jul 25, 1999",10/10,"This is simply one of the best movies ever made, and ah! The music! Mozart was the end of the Classical Era of music, because simply, after Mozart, nothing further could be said in that genre.This is based on Peter Schaffer's play, however, resembles the actual history in that the people in it did in fact live. The events, however, bear little resemblance to the actual history of Mozart.  This does not matter one bit. F. Murray Abraham is spectacular as the scheming Salieri, a competent, if not gifted, composer forced to watch ""this crude little man"", Mozart, achieve all that Salieri wanted in his own music.See this movie at all costs. Blow off work. Sell your house. You will not regret it"
irishm,"Jul 22, 2014",4/10,"When this film was released in 1984 you literally could not escape from it ads were everywhere, all over the TV and print media. My usual impulse is to refuse to see any film that gets crammed down my throat hundreds of times before it even arrives in theaters, so it can be quite some time before I get around to seeing a movie even if the reviews are generally good. My impression from the numerous trailers for 'Amadeus' was that it was a farcical treatment of a real-life classical composer, starring a man with a stupid grin wearing a fright wig, accompanied by a lot of people in 18th century garb dancing in ballrooms.Yep, that's what it was. I finally watched it last night, 30 years after Tom Hulce's ventriloquist-dummy grimace first appeared on my TV screen. It was even the ultra-long director's cut which added about 20 minutes to what would have been a long film in the first place. I finished it, but I'm really not sure why. Obviously they spent a lot of money on it, F. Murray Abraham was good, and naturally the music was good, but I don't think it lived up to the hype and accolades. Maybe my taste is all in my mouth, but I don't regret not beating down the theater door to see it 30 years ago."
iainwatson,"Aug 23, 2002",N/A,"Peter Shaffer's 'Amadeus' is back on general cinema release today - in Forman's original 'Directors Cut'. With an extra 20 minutes of added footage the film that blew me away as a kid did it again.I sat like a stunned 10 year old in and was blown away all over again - I sat and laughed at Mozart's antic's, marvelled at the absolutely amazing music (especially the scene's of Mozart conducting his Operas), and gasped as he descends into an illness and madness forced upon him by Salieri.This is cinema as it's meant to be - MASSIVE. Watching it again after nearly 15 years I saw how it's influenced today's cinema - most notably 'Moulin Rouge'. Weighing in at nearly 3 hours, and with the seriousness of the film it's certainly not for lightweights - the largly empty cinema (3 other people were in there I think) a testament to that fact. I think this is a sad indication of the current filmgoing public when the horribly terrible 'Reign of Fire' was showing to a nearly sold out audience at 1.30 on a Friday afternoon (the dragon's were nice tho).This is a film that people NEED to see. It's about genius, it's about love, it's about hate, it's about tragedy. It'll make you laugh, gasp, and cry. It really is that good. If your into music the whole spectacle will make your jaw drop - if your not into music you should see the film at least 3 times until you are. It's definitely one of my top 10 all time faves."
msbloch,"Nov 20, 2011",10/10,"Okay, ""Equus"" (by Peter Shaffer) is clever and original but a little far out. But Shaffer's ""Amadeus"" raises the ante by adding enveloping universal themes in a compelling dialog deserving of its Best Picture Academy Award. Who could not be moved by Salieri, the court composer, who initially promises to devote himself and his music to God. Only to realize that he is and will only be ""mediocre."" He is merely blessed ""with an ear"", and the knowledge, to recognize the pure beauty of the work of the silly and vulgar Mozart. As Salieri's devotion morphs into a battle against God and His instrument, Mozart, and as Salieri's schemes succeed and fail by chance and design, the twisting of Salieri's mind is depicted with the painful whisperings and gestures of hands and face (of Murray Abraham) in a way rarely seen on the screen. Iago (from Shakespeare's Othello) has nothing on Salieri. Except that Salieri has fallen and knows it and seeks absolution. As you leave the theater, you may ask why health, success, and happiness comes so effortlessly to the wicked and why the righteous are often overlooked. Or you may ask why Salieri did not simply embrace and foster the beauty in his midst. Or ask why Salieri was not satisfied with the bounty of his life. Most of us are content to hear ""the duet change into a trio into a quartet into a quintet into a sextet with more complex harmonies"" without reviling the composer. But Salieri reveals our darkside that sees another's perfect dive, perfect pass, perfect statement, or perfect notes that prompt ""why not me?"" Of course, the meaning of ""Amadeus"" -- ""God's love"" -- is not lost on the viewer and only contributes to the 10 of 10 rating the movie deserves. Kudos to Shaffer, Milos Forman (director), F.M. Abraham, Tim Hulce (who moves way beyond ""Animal House"" here to create the mathematically musical facility and obnoxiousness of Mozart), and the lighting and musical contributors in fitting the puzzle pieces together so nicely."
Vartiainen,"Nov 16, 2016",9/10,"Amadeus is the fictionalized biography of one Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the most famous classical composer to ever walk the Earth. It tells the story from the point of Antonio Salieri, a contemporary composer, whose name has been largely lost to history except for those that study musical history.It's an all-around excellent period drama. The costumes and the visuals are top-notch, the score of course features some of the most recognizable pieces of classical music ever made and the production values in general are without any flaw. So it would be a pretty good film even if there was nothing else to it. But there is. This is one of my favourite character studies ever put to film. The character of Mozart, played by Tom Hulce, is a fascinating one. In this film he's portrayed as a musical savant. A buffoon of a man, endlessly consumed by the vices of drink, flesh and luxury, yet within him play the bells of heaven. The arias of God himself make themselves heard through this wreck of a man. And Salieri, a man who has dedicated his whole life to God as thanks for his musical ability, absolutely despises him because of this. Why Mozart? Why not him? What glory has this man achieved to be worthy of the kind of music he's capable of producing?And yet, despite all his flaws, despite all the contempt we heap upon him through Salieri, Mozart has redeeming qualities. His passion for music is unparalleled. His ability and sheer skill is without equals. He has flaws, vices, heavy leanings towards sin. And yet, though his music, the world is a brighter place because of him. And that has to count for something.Amadeus places the story before history. There are many facts which happened quite differently. Yet it is a masterful story. Enchanting, deeply personal, philosophical and, above all else, captivating, it will make you weep for these poor souls captured in the webs of their own mortal failings."
Geeky Randy,"Feb 1, 2010",8/10,"Shaffer adapts his play into film, which chronicles composer Antonio Salieri (Abraham) and his plot to ruin Amadeus Mozart (Hulce). Historically inaccurate, but then again it's not a biography. Even though Salieri knows Mozart is a genius, his jealousy craves the ranting towards Mozart's music, such as the Emporer's (Jones) criticism of one of Mozart's pieces having ""too many notes"". It appears Forman and Shaffer should have taken their own advice, as the film starts to drag significantly during the second half, mainly due to drawn out opera scenes. As the film comes to an end, the viewer can't help but feel satisfied by, not only a well-told story, but also (and more importantly) the brilliance of music contained in the film. Hulce was extremely critical about playing music, with musical scholars complimenting that every note of music matches that seen on screen, which is both a film and musical triumph!***½ (out of four)"
oscarhopkins,"Oct 2, 2005",8/10,"This is a love or hate situation.I've had friends hate this film, mainly for the historical inaccuracies, and I've had people hate it because Mozart annoyed them. Personally, I am enthralled every time I see it.The original stage play script offers a few vignettes that are missing in the film, but the heart of why Amedeus was as grand a film as a theatre experience is in the details.The scenery alone makes this film gorgeous. Ditto the costumes and the interior sets.Not a few talents were in high form as well; first and foremost F. Murray Abraham. His work here will seal him forever as one of the cinema's finest dramatic actors.Tom Hulce is also a treat, but perhaps too-often overlooked is Jeffrey Jones as Emperor Joseph II. His simple and charming performance is delicate and intentional.Much could be said, but perhaps the most important advice for viewers of this film is to take it for what it is: a rare morality play from master film makers. This is a film to think about long after it's over."
razing,"Jul 26, 2002",10/10,"I was blown away by this film the first time I saw it, but when I saw the director's cut (and on the big screen, baby!) the original theatrical release was put to shame.  So much more about the intricacies of the relationships between the characters (especially Salieri and Constanze) is revealed, which really completes the climax.  I don't want to give anything away--just see this movie!"
gilleliath,"Apr 17, 2021",7/10,"This does less than justice to Mozart as a personality, being based on the facile premise that if someone is capable both of coarse behaviour and sublime music then the music must be produced in some sense unknowingly - without a full understanding of itself - a bit like the philosophical chimp producing the complete works of Shakespeare. But of course people, and probably geniuses especially, are complex; coarseness and spirituality can both be equally genuine expressions of the same nature (though probably not at the same time!).Of course the boorish Mozart is necessary in order to concoct this pot-boiler story about the resentment of goody two-shoes Salieri; but to make your main character a bit of an a-hole is dubious policy. Wouldn't a more realistic, less febrile treatment of the man, with Haydn encouraging him rather than Salieri out to nobble him, have been more satisfying in the end?There are moments where Mozart 'the voice of God' shines through (though it would be more accurate to call him the voice of yearning for God), but they're too few in a film that is too long. The music and staging are lovely, though."
PayOrPlay,"Aug 15, 2002",9/10,"Amadeus is an almost perfect realization of its central conceit.  If you accept that conceit (and I find it tremendously entertaining to do so, for the sake of the argument) Forman's picture plays it out flawlessly, assisted by phenomenal acting: Abraham's great brooding self-hating Salieri, Tom Hulce's hilarious embodiment of Mozart as a sort of 18th century version of Jerry Lee Lewis, not to mention Jeffrey Jones' brilliant portrayal of Emperor Joseph as a stolid, well-meaning bureaucrat trying ever so hard to be a good and creative philosopher king in defiance of his true (dull) nature.  The music is performed and explained in a way that non-classicists can follow and learn from.  A moving delight that rewards repeat viewing."
aangelo861,"Sep 11, 2021",6/10,"Tells a great story about the lives of Mozart and his counterpart Salieri. The character portrayal of Salieri was complex and realistic, which was 3 dimensional and intimate, whilst that of Mozart was clumsy to say the least.The film was trying to make us hate Mozart, as we saw a lot of the scenes from salieri's point of view, but this doesn't seem to be realistic and seems like a caricature more than anything else.The film was quite anti-climatic in the depiction of mozart's death and it didn't allow the other characters to reflect on such the big event. I would have loved to see what happens to Constanze after Mozart's death ..."
C_Kivi,"Oct 17, 1998",N/A,"This is possibly the best movie I've ever seen.  The movie is really about the mediocre composer, Salieri.  The title 'Amadeus' (Mozart's middle name) translated means 'gift of God.' It was Mozart's gift that has Salieri diabolically jealous.  In this way the movie becomes a study of his emotions.  As Salieri, F. Murray Abraham's Oscar-winning performance was the best I have ever seen.  The use of Mozart's music as the score is perfect. Don't stray from this movie because you think it will be boring.  'Amadeus' moves well, the narrative format keeps things going fast, it's also very funny in parts, and as the film approaches the ending it becomes very suspenseful and even a little spooky.  This movie is a masterpiece."
hotham1975,"Apr 30, 2001",10/10,"This was the best film I have ever seen in my life.  If F.Murray Abraham reads this I want to start up your fan club!  Why are you not doing movies of the same calibre anymore????  I know top Hollywood producers are probably interested in this web site, and I am begging them to think of you, when they are casting!!! Unlike allot of films made in the last 20 years, this was actually a brilliant adaptation from the original play.  Tom Hulce was a bit of an odd choice as Mozart, (his accent slipping a bit) but he was still very convincing as Mozart. The only thing that spoils the film is that most of it isn't factually correct.  I just wish Hollywood could make more movies of this standard. I'd like to thank Milos Foreman for giving it a good hard try."
melaniet-1,"May 1, 2001",10/10,"Grazie a Lei, Milos Forman for your skillful direction.  Whatever a movie is supposed to be, Amadeus is definitely it.  Although the dialogue stumbles over some colloquialisms, the movie is otherwise extremely beautiful and well-thought out.  It made me almost regret my mediocrity and sympathize with Salieri.  Almost.I first saw Amadeus in my junior year of high school, after a friend recommended it to me.  It made such an impression that I decided I was going to go to the Mozart Music Festival in Salzburg the following summer. Probably what struck me most about the film was its dramatic portrayal of Salieri, a man who blended into the 18th century music scene so well, his history can only be linked with Mozart, and although not mentioned, Beethoven, one of his later pupils.  Watching Salieri struggle with his mediocrity created a pang in my side - how often are we all forced to witness genius and know that we can never achieve it?  What is even more interesting is the dichotomy between the side of him that longs to destroy Mozart and the side of him that worships every note Mozart composes. Mozart's character was more conventional in that it portrayed an artist who falls short of his work.  ""Your majesty, I am a vulgar man, but I assure you, my music is not...""  Even if the less than factual depiction of Mozart offends some people, the dexterous use of music alone is worth watching the movie.Go see the movie already, if you haven't."
Lemniscate433,"Jul 16, 2009",8/10,"The way the tag-line is written, the movie sounds like some Disney film. Amadeus. The man. The music. The magic. The madness. The murder. The mystery. The motion picture. Anyway, this movie is very great. The acting is great, the music is great, the scenery is great. It is just one of those lovable classic films.So I guess from just the title of the movie, you can assume that this film is based on the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. A biography if you may say. However, this movie is NOT a strict biography of Mozart's life. The movie is not a musical biography like Walk the Line or Ray. So if you were planning to learn all of the small details of Mozart's life, you ain't getting that in this movie. In fact, the background of the movie is based a lot on superstition and creative thinking with the relationship between Mozart and Salieri. We start off with Mozart's life in the movie with him proposing to Constanze, who is later known to be his wife and only wife. Before Mozart got married, there was so much more to his life as a child with the abuse of his father and having to travel all over Europe that could have supplemented his movie. Because in this movie, we learn that Mozart was not exactly a nice guy to be with. He was a social misfit, all because of a childhood he never had which was replaced by his father making him tour over Europe and showing off his musical abilities.The main premise in this movie is about Salieri and the whole idea that he might have killed Mozart. Salieri tells the story from his perspective to a priest in an asylum about Mozart. Salieri was the most famous composer in all of England, but once Mozart came about, Salieri became a has-been. This got Salieri angry and the growing jealously of Salieri got him to the point where he dedicated his whole life to destroying Mozart. And like I said before, we do not know if this is true that Salieri did kill Mozart.But enough with the negativity. I thought the acting was brilliant. Tom Hulce acts well as the unattractive and rowdy Mozart. F. Murray Abraham being Salieri was also just as great if not greater than Hulce. I mean they were both persuasive with their acting and used the material they were given for their characters and played it well. Also, there were scenes in the movie that you can tell required a lot of hard work to create because they either had a lot of men and women in the scene or because there was a great amount of sound editing going on. The director's cut clocks at three hours, but I guarantee you that you will be spell bounded for those three hours. Because although the movie does not have a fast pace, it still keeps you locked in.I would say that the movie did have some scenes were it felt kind of 80s such as Mozart's antics and sexual insinuation that was placed in the movie. But none the less, this is a great story and I am glad that it was not a strict biography, because to tell you the truth, after watching this film, I would prefer this film over a strict biography. The creativeness that Forman and Shaffer add to it makes the movie only more special.Low eight."
Starlily80s,"Aug 13, 2000",10/10,"This is without a doubt my favourite film of all time. I must have seen it hundreds of times but it never fails to enthrall me, and I'm always left with a lump in my throat at the ending.Tom Hulce is amazingly convincing as the hilarious, impish Mozart, and shows his versatility - he is alternately hilarious, engaging, arrogant, endearing, loveable, infuriating, and inevitably tragic.F.Murray Abraham is also terrifyingly convincing as the demonic, possessed Salieri, and acts well with Hulce. Please, please watch this film - although if you are reading this review you probably already have - it is truly wonderful.Without a doubt the best part of the film is when Mozart re-writes Salieri's little ode for him, to the astonishment of the Emperor, Rosenburg and co. (does anyone else detest Rosenburg with a vengeance??), and this is where we are first introduced to the famous shrieking laugh! I love that laugh so much, it never fails to put me in hysterics.Anyway, to summarise: Fantastic acting, wonderful soundtrack (of course), sumptuous costumes and backdrops, gripping storyline, range of emotions..... absolutely 10/10"
LeonLouisRicci,"Sep 30, 2013",10/10,"Accessibility is the Operative Word here, in this Glorious, Off-Center Presentation on the Genius, Influential, and Beloved Composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. Up until the late Sixties Classical Music was often referred to as Longhair. Meaning, of course, to the Lengthy Locks of Beethoven, Mozart, Bach, etc. It was sometimes used as a Condescension, meaning out of date, Ancient, High-Brow and such.Twentieth Century Youths and most of the Proletariat were unfamiliar, or vaguely so, of the Music or the Musicians or the Compositions that languished in thick, dusty, and heavy Record Collection Book-Albums and were considered to be boring, long, and Anachronistic to Modern Sensibilities. This was the age of Jazz, Blues, Swing, Country and Western, Pop, Rock n' Roll, Punk, and Rap/Hip-Hop.The decision to approach Mozart with a Reverential Tweakness was an Inspiration on Director Milos Forman's part. It gave Access to the Music and the Man, and Created a new appreciation for the Moderns who generally Loathed Classic Music and Opera. The Movie took much Criticism for its Bawdy, Gonzo take on a Sacred Cow.The Film is Loads of Fun with an undercurrent of Tragedy that is Beautifully Shot, Impeccably Costumed, and Superbly Acted. But most of all it is Highly Entertaining for a Mass Audience including those with little interest in the Subject or the Subject Matter.Even those with some Contempt, found in this Movie a way to Appreciate the Master, His Music, and the Period. With its Outrageous Costumes, Outdated Customs and some Hip-Lip. Simply put, this is a Modernization of Madness, both in the Film's Style and those that make up the Story. A Genius of an approach on the Portrayal of a Genius."
Hyyr,"Apr 18, 2001",10/10,"My girlfriend practically dragged me by my heels into the theater to see this movie.  I really could not think of a more boring topic for a movie than Mozart.  However, this splendid film completely captivated me, holding my attention so well that three hours passed in a virtual flash.  At the end, I felt as drained as the priest in Salieri's room.  Fantastic sets, wonderful casting and superb use of the camera made this possibly the best film I have ever seen. The plot was disturbingly well done- it was almost too painful to watch at times.  Like any really well-done drama, this movie is felt as well as seen.  I even had preordered the LaserDisc, so I could have this must-see gem in my home collection.Whether you are a classical music/opera fan or not, this is essential cinema fare."
AaronCapenBanner,"Sep 7, 2013",7/10,"Tom Hulce memorably portrays brilliant composer Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart(said to have perfect pitch) a deeply gifted musician with one big drawback: he is also a vulgar buffoon, with no real appreciation of his talents.F. Murray Abraham(Brilliant, unforgettable Academy Award winning performance) plays Antonio Salieri, another contemporary composer who is a sophisticated, cultured gentleman, but unfortunately, who also has only a fraction of Mozart's talent. This jealousy causes him to become not only a bitter enemy of Mozart, but estranged from God, because he cannot understand why God would give such an exquisite gift to someone so unworthy...Two towering performances and beautiful production compensate for over length and some pompousness, but it is really the philosophical duel between Salieri, Mozart, and God, that make this picture so good."
janardhanvidyut,"Sep 14, 2022",2/10,"When one makes a big screen movie like this, one expects it to be at the very least historically accurate. It is not. Depicting Mozart as some douche who got music without trying is so wrong. He might have been a douche, but he worked hard on his music. One expected to see the struggles of the musician, both external and intenral of which we see none. All we see him is bedding woman after woman. One would expect the filmmakers to have done basic research on how mozart actually helped bring music to the masses instead of reserving it for the hoiety toiety of the court which is precisely why he was more popular the Sallieri. But do we see any of that? Nope. They have made this into a petty envy movie between musicians competing for emperor's attention. There is so much surrounding the life of mozart and the changes he brought into how music was written and for whom. But the moviemakers decided we need none of that. We are content showing mozart as some sort of old timey axl rose and call it a day. I seriously dont understand why people like this. It doesnt make them any more informed about the bare history let alone develops their understanding of music. People will come out with this misinformation in their heads and feel informed. Do we really need that on top of the trash education system we have?"
Cal-5,"Aug 6, 1998",N/A,"F. Murray Abraham deservedly won an Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Antonio Salieri. Salieri is driven mad by his jealousy of Amadeus. Abraham captures Salieri's anger and jealousy perfectly. Tom Hulce is excellent as the great Amadeus. Milos Forman does a very good job directing, however, he tends to let the story drag along very slowly a couple of times."
peapulation,"Apr 4, 2005",8/10,"The bet of making a movie about not exactly the life of Mozart but the conflict between himself and a less talented composer, Salieri was well won. This isn't just a theory, it's also backed up by good researches and studies.This movie also shows the ultimate contrast between supremacy and mediocrity.The setting of Prague and Montemerano, Italy, give this movie a very realistic look and add dept to the dramatic-ism of the scenes in the movies.Pure genius, pure genius indeed. This movie not only deserves a look but also two thumbs up."
sloopbillyb,"Sep 16, 2001",9/10,"Every once in a while, Hollywood gives us a lush epic similar to the ones they made so often in the 50's.  Most of these films are not good.  Most of them are too long or are just ridiculous.  For ""Amadeus"" this is not the case.  Every wide-screen frame is lovingly packed with detail and color. It is perhaps the most beautiful movie of the 80's.  The script is impressive, and although the writers may not have been too true to history, they certainly appreciated the otherworldly genius of Mozart.  F. Murray Abraham does splendid work, and Tom Hulce is the ideal actor for the musical nut case.  (By the way, what's happened to Tom Hulce?)  The film is surprisingly witty for a period film.  Over all, ""Amadeus"" is definitely a fine epic worthy of butt-numbing for."
ww1red_baron,"Sep 20, 2005",10/10,"Amadeus is an excellent movie in every sense of the word.Recreation of Mozart's heavenly music ,great acting performances by F.Murray Abraham & Tom Hulce,excellent costumes...& the list goes on.Viewer's should not be swayed away by the depictions in the movie.Mozart was well versed with compositions of every leading composer of Europe & was not God to create music out of his mind.Depiction of Mozart as an alchol addict and promiscuous are not correct.Moreover Mozart knew how to behave in front of the aristocracy.Antonio Saleiri was a great composer and never actually tried to destroy Mozart.In fact his attempt to suicide was not due to any guilt conscience but possibly due to the shock he received when he heard the news of one of his favorite disciple's untimely demise.However the movie would have been drab and boring if Mozart's biography was depicted.The plot is good and enjoyable."
LillieK-6,"Jan 13, 2026",6/10,"The composition of the songs were obviously amazing, but I think the score wasn't to the best of the ability it could have been. There are hundreds of different Mozarts that they could have chosen to take samples from and it felt like they took different parts of the same three samples and called it a day. They really only used two-three operas, and his death requisite and found ways to add those four things into different parts of the movies. However, I also understand that it was about the end of Mozarts life, so I understand and see why it would make sense to have pieces from only a few of his operas. The movie, personally, did not resonate with me as much as some of the others did. To be completely honest, I fell asleep a couple of times throughout the screenings of the movie. Biopics are always either hit or miss, and sometimes throughout this one it felt like there could have been more added in to make it a bit more eye opening to the audience. Then again, it is a movie about someone in the 1700's, so really how exciting were their lives? A few of the scenes felt a bit unnecessary. I would have liked to have seen more of Mozart and Salieri friendship towards the end of Mozarts life, but from what we got I think most everything added up to each other and the scenes aligned nicely."
nikmahcapee,"Oct 1, 2024",9/10,"*Amadeus* (1984), directed by Milos Shaffer's acclaimed play, is a mesmerizing biographical drama that explores the life of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his rival, Antonio Salieri. The film takes artistic liberties with historical events, but in doing so, it crafts a deeply engaging and emotionally resonant story of genius, envy, and the fragility of human nature. It's less about the factual details of Mozart's life and more about Salieri's struggle to reconcile his mediocrity with Mozart's brilliance.The story is framed as a confession by the aging Salieri (played magnificently by F. Murray Abraham), who claims to have played a role in Mozart's untimely death. Salieri is portrayed as a devout man who believes that God has abandoned him by granting such divine musical talent to the immature and boisterous Mozart (Tom Hulce). This juxtaposition of Salieri's discipline and ambition against Mozart's effortless genius drives the emotional core of the film. Abraham's portrayal of Salieri is both tragic and terrifying, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor. Hulce's portrayal of Mozart as a genius with childlike exuberance and a crude sense of humor adds layers of complexity to the character.*Amadeus* is a visually stunning film, with its lavish period costumes and grand set designs capturing the opulence of 18th-century Vienna. The film's cinematography and attention to detail in recreating the world of classical music are breathtaking. Mozart's compositions are central to the film's narrative, and the way they are woven into the story elevates the film from a biopic to an almost operatic experience. The music becomes a character in itself, illustrating the emotional and spiritual depths of the film.One of the most powerful aspects of *Amadeus* is its exploration of the themes of jealousy, mediocrity, and divine talent. Salieri's hatred for Mozart is driven not just by jealousy but by a deep existential crisis-his realization that no matter how hard he tries, he will never be able to create music like Mozart's. The film makes Salieri a deeply relatable figure, as he grapples with feelings of inadequacy that many viewers might recognize. His inability to accept Mozart's natural talent leads him down a dark path of sabotage and manipulation, culminating in a deeply tragic finale.The film's success lies in its ability to balance humor, tragedy, and grand spectacle. Mozart's rise and fall are as much about human nature as they are about the music, and this is what makes *Amadeus* a timeless masterpiece. The film's portrayal of Mozart's decline into poverty and illness, and Salieri's torment, is heartbreaking, leaving viewers questioning the nature of talent, justice, and the role of divine will.Overall, *Amadeus* is a beautifully crafted and emotionally powerful film that transcends the traditional biopic. It is a celebration of Mozart's music and a deep meditation on the complexities of artistic genius, jealousy, and the human condition. With outstanding performances, masterful direction, and an unforgettable score, *Amadeus* remains one of the greatest films of the 20th century."

pdmarsay,"Jan 3, 2006",10/10,"I have only seen Amadeus: The Director's Cut, so I cannot comment on the original version unfortunately. This film has reached the no.3 spot in my personal list of all time favourites. It is so gloriously enthralling to watch, it is a cinematic experience like no other. It is equally terrifying as it is hilarious. ""Do you believe in that? Fire, burning you forever after you die?"" ""Oh yes."" That short exchange between Mozart and Salieri, (no matter how inaccurate my quoting of it is, apologies if it is,) is mind-blowingly frightening. I think that this film is for lovers of great music, classical in particular, intellectuals, lovers of great cinema, and even I think, theologians. It is hard to tell, or it is for me at least, weather this film is a direct attack on God, or a fearful thought on his existence. The characters in the film certainly believe in him. Being a Christian myself, these themes were more poignant in my mind, although there are many others, including love, hate, morality, and the value of life. Overall this is an incredibly beautiful, endlessly enjoyable story, which really made me appreciate classical music more than ever before. I recommend this very highly and hope you enjoy and and enjoy thinking about its themes. It certainly left me thinking very hard, with Mozarts music playing in the background of my mind. (Sorry, Salieri, I'm afraid not much of your music stuck in my head in quite the same way.)"

Peech-2,"Nov 30, 1999",10/10,"If I remember well, this was the second movie I saw in a theatre. When I came home, aged ten, I asked my parents if we had any records of this Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart. And if there were other people like him who wrote such music nowadays. Ever since, Mozart and his music, as well as many other classical composers, have been important in my life. As well as this movie! I dare easily say that this is one of the best movies ever made: the setting, combined with these actors, this direction and of course this music have made this movie a classic. 10/10!"
bat-5,"Jun 26, 1999",10/10,"I had the fortune of watching Amadeus for the first time on laserdisc a few years ago.  After that viewing, I fell in love with that movie.  The costumes, the art direction, and the music!  F. Murray Abraham is perfect as the tortured Salieri, a mediocre composer that plots and schemes against the loutish, but incredibly gifted, Mozart.  Tom Hulce gives Mozart a boyish charm, and that laugh!  That high pitched giggle that haunts Salieri till the very end.  The music of Mozart is heard constantly through out the film. You can see the foreshadowing and hear it, whenever Mozart's father appears. And when the Don Giovanni piece appears, it all makes sense.  The best scene in the film is when Mozart is ill, and Salieri sees this as his chance to get even with God.  Mozart hears the music that will eventually become the Requiem, all in his head.  As he dictates the score, Salieri becomes overwhelmed by the genius of Mozart.  But, the ultimate indignation for this great composer comes at the end.  The Lacrymosa is playing and we see Mozart's final resting place.  A mass, unmarked grave.  All dramacticaly punctuated by a massive choir, and you feel just like the priest that is taking Salieri's confession.  A great film that showcases music by one of the greatest composers ever to live."
Mr_Hulot,"Sep 23, 2002",8/10,"Was Amadeus a hippie, a hedonist, a proto rock-star, a rebel, or is Forman just portraying him as such to fit the patterns of his continuing cinematic exegesis of historical figures?  Forman was raised under two dire dictatorships, the Nazi and then later the Stalinist.  No doubt that such a background fostered in his heart a dislike for all formal authority, for legalistic structures, and inspired in his mind a love for that archetypical rebel figure, the one who does not so much fight authority, because he despises it, but through virtue of higher alligence, to his own personal vision or inspiration, simply comports his life as though authority did not exist.Mozart as presented by Forman fits this mold, and is a spiritual brother to Andy Kaufman, Larry Flint, and Randle Mc Murphy in Man on the Moon, the People vs. Larry Flint, and One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest respectively.  He is giving us the same character over and over again, and telling us the same story at different times and places throughout the ages. This is fair enough if Forman sees this as the essential struggle occurring within the confines of the cosmos, but does his vision also encompass the masses or is he giving us the anti- Tolstoy an view that history is driven only by the actions of a few isolated great men, visionaries and revolutionaries? Yes, I like this movie, but it does not give us the sweep and grandeur that would properly reflect the music of it's subject.  Ultimately it tells us more about it's author then it does about its main character.  Is this a case of the cannibalism of history in order to support a director's personal vision, or simple appropriation of powerful `symbolic' personalities in order to present a Manichean view of the universe? I cannot pretend to know.I know this, the film is energetic and amusing, like all of Forman's work that I have seen, and leaves the audience with a stronger feeling of connection with the misunderstood individualist visionary then it does with the gray world which is bent on crushing him, here represented by rival composer Salieri.  The best thing it can do is inspire an audience member to take the first few tottering steps out of hypnotic TV created reality and try to create a world of his own.  Why Forman hasn't gotten around to filming the life of Vincent Van Gogh is a mystery that remains unsolved.8/10"

Murray Abraham's performance was certainly of Oscar Caliber. I have given the move a rating of ""9"". I would have given this movie a ""10"" except for the inaccuracies and, in particular, the injustice to the character of Salieri. Salieri was not the court composer when Mozart arrived in Vienna; Gluck held that post. Salieri was the conductor of the opera. When Gluck died Mozart replaced him (Gluck) as court composer. Salieri's chief ""fault"" was his own self-deprecation. He often bemoaned his own limitations as a composer. It seems that if you claim to being a failure, people are willing to believe it to be a fact. Western Society likes ""winners"". In fact Salieri was a better composer than he thought himself, if not as great as Mozart, and was an outstanding musical teacher who's pupils included Beethoven, Liszt and Schubert."

This movie portrays all we feel today as people get better than us, but reminds us not to forget the fact that we must not get caught up in the obvious solution, but that we need to simply be free! Free from guilt, free from jealousy, and free from deception and disappointment!"
melz_the_great,"Sep 24, 2006",10/10,"This has got to be my favorite movie of all time. The music of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart has never been so powerful. Perfectly cast and backed up with beautiful music words cannot describe how moving and beautiful this piece of art truly is.The actors cease to be actors, they transform into their characters, and the direction is wonderful. The story is captivating, and the flashback way to do the film adds a wonderful artistic element to it. While the movie may not be historical accurate, 100%, it doesn't hurt it in the slightest bit. It achieves in great lengths in storytelling.Watching the musical grandeur, and how the classical music can affect us all is amazing. But the movie digs deeper then that, questioning the musical intelligence, relationships with God, feeling inadequate, and people's fear of mediocrity. The movie is not a biography of Mozart.The words written in the screenplay describing music are amazing.See this movie, you will not regret it."
blur13,"Oct 27, 2000",9/10,"For a movie that is based on a storyline that is - to put it mildly - an outrageous lie, Amadeus is still an enjoyable tale from start to finish. Even the presence of American accents (most notably, Mozarts wife) roaming the corridors of 18th century European nobility doesn't detract greatly from the experience. Yes, it's that good. Immerse yourself in the music and try not to take the storyline too seriously."
signlady,"Jun 30, 2024",6/10,"REALLY late to the show - but this was a good period movie - wardrobe production & Abraham especially as an elderly Salieri.Other than a few actual names, & a few random events very loosely interpreted as reality - this is just a purely fictional movie that simply portrays Mozart as a sort of amalgamation of many composers of the era.Here is a quote from a bio on Salieri:""Even as his (Salieri's) works dropped from performance, and he wrote no new operas after 1804, he still remained one of the most important and sought-after teachers of his generation, and his influence was felt in every aspect of Vienna's musical life. Franz Liszt, Franz Schubert, Ludwig van Beethoven, Anton Eberl, Johann Nepomuk Hummel and Franz Xaver Wolfgang Mozart were among the most famous of his (Salieri's) pupils.Salieri's music slowly disappeared from the repertoire between 1800 and 1868 and was rarely heard after that period until the revival of his fame in the late 20th century. This revival was due to the fictionalized depiction of Salieri in Peter Shaffer's play Amadeus (1979) and the 1984 film version of the play.The death of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart in 1791 at the age of 35 was followed by rumors that he and Salieri had been bitter rivals, and that Salieri had poisoned the younger composer; however, this has been proven untrue because the symptoms displayed by Mozart's illness did not indicate poisoning, and it is likely that they were, at least, mutually respectful peers. Despite denying the allegation, Salieri was greatly affected by the accusations and widespread public belief that he had contributed to Mozart's death, which contributed to his nervous breakdowns in later life.""There is also no indication that Mozart was suffering from 'daddy-issues' - or that his father was overly-controlling or overly-critical of his sons life. It appears that Mozart had natural talent & a prodigy-like ability with music at a very young age, which his father simply nurtured.Anyway, enjoy the movie, beautiful sets, wardrobe, & wonderful acting for itself, while aware that this story is 90% fiction.That said, I have this on DVD & watch it about once a year - which includes a very interesting & entertaining special feature of comments from almost all the production and several of the key actors."
dh-t21,"Jun 21, 2018",4/10,"The movie loses a lot of it's punch when you find out afterwards that a lot of the content is in fact BS. Mozart travelled to a lot of European cities during this time. His music was a lot more successful than portrayed in the movie. 
The 'paupers' grave was BS. It was common during that time for non-aristocrats to be buried in 'common graves' that were re-used 10 years later. 
The bitter rivalry between Salieri & Mozart, the basis of the movie & that Salieri killed Mozart are BS & most likely come from a Pushkin short story. The movie totally ignores that Mozart became a Freemason 7 years before death & the importance it had it his life."

If you own a copy on dvd, look at the extra info on the work they put into this film, it's enormous!! Two thumbs up!!

halnexus,"Sep 18, 1999",10/10,"There's a certain structure in Milos Forman's ""Amadeus"" which is bewitching in allegory, even if it proves somewhat shaky in execution.  Based on Peter Shaffer's play, ""Amadeus"" illustrates in flashback through narrator Antonio Salieri (F. Murray Abraham) the contradictive genius behind child prodigy Mozart (Tom Hulce), a man with a gift for musical symphony underlying a childish, though unintentional facade.  Caught in a tug-of-war between 18th-century censorship techniques of the Viennese court of Emperor Joseph II (Jeffrey Jones) and his own regrettable appreciation of Mozart's revolutionary genius, Salieri embarks upon a subplot which occasionally results in him being lost in his own autobiography.  This flaw would be more glaring if it weren't for a magnificent performance by Abraham as a man slighted by divinity.The movie begins with Salieri's confession to a priest in a hospital following his suicide attempt.  After claiming to have ""killed Mozart"", Salieri proceeds to explain his motivations.  These originated with Salieri's childhood dream of becoming a ""musical instrument"" for God, only to be taunted by the Almighty through Mozart's melodious compositions. Aghast at the aspect, Salieri forsakes Him and proceeds to plan his own bitter destruction of the ""beloved of God"".Even if the film were nothing more than a costume epic, it would still be a marvel to watch.  Women in busts barely concealing their cleavage and men whose masculinity protrude through even the most rigid of wear personify the lust still inherent beneath all those layers of decoration.  Patrizia von Brandenburg's set designs are nothing short of immaculate with their lavish plethora of details.The film's goal to balance Salieri's jealousy with Mozart's musical martyrdom seems at times implausible.  If the story is seen through Salieri's eyes, how can it intrude upon Mozart's married life?  Indeed, during the film's central act, Salieri tends to disappear for long stretches at a time.Nevertheless, one could make the argument that it is necessary to detail both lives in order to show the turmoil between conservative aristocracy and Mozart's vastly underappreciated compositions.  Of course, like Forman's ""The People vs. Larry Flynt"", the film makes inevitable comparisons to the modern-day debate of expression, including the emperor's traditional beliefs that there are ""too many notes!"" in Mozart's work.  This sort of modernized, countercultural philosophy is presented not only in Mozart's uninhibitedness, but also in various other elements: the unapproving father, the conservative establishment and the eventual degradation of classics into more accessible media, such as the vaudevillian treatment ""Don Giovanni"" receives.  Indeed Salieri, through the amazingly subtle actions of Abraham, sees the future and ""speaks for all mediocrity"" in condemning those whose extraordinary talents put others who are merely ordinary to shame.  This is an instinctual part of human nature: from schoolboy to occupationist, from 18th-century Austria to 20th-century America, there will always be those envious of one's superior talent.  But Forman and Abraham dramatize just how hard it is to pass the torch to potential scene-stealers.  While Mozart's music may lift us to otherworldly elevations, Salieri's story entrenches us into our own humanity."
jdoan-4,"Nov 11, 2005",9/10,"This movie very effectively combines Mozart's music with the plot. This movie wouldn't have been anything without Mozart's music. As it is, it is an extremely well made film. I understand that this movie is not entirely historically accurate. I don't think it is supposed to be. It takes the elements of a historical events and creates a very powerful fictional story. All the acting is superb. Murray is fantastic as Salerei. He is so hateful, so spiteful, and yet so astounded by Mozart's ability. This movie looks amazing. There is so much detail and so much texture in each scene, you can almost smell the environment. The sets are as important a character as any person in the movie. The costumes are amazing as well. I think the greatest character in this movie is the music. It lingers through each scene like a lifeforce. It permeates your senses and enraptures you. I says more than any other character in the film. Mozart's music lives in this movie. It is amazing."
hellodavey,"Mar 5, 2007",10/10,"Like many people no doubt would have said before this F. Murray Abraham's Salieri is probably the single greatest acting performance I have seen. It forms the basis of an already excellent idea for the story. Any story is made so much better when it is told well and I couldn't imagine it being told better than this.Virtually all ""the great"" films have their memorable soundtrack. The Godfather, The Good The Bad and The Ugly, Schindler's list...and if the music makes the film... well there's not much more to say here either.Number 79 is far too low a ranking for a film of this calibre. This is one of THE Great Films."
RiffRaffMcKinley,"May 9, 2009",10/10,"The director of ""Hair"" (which I contend was actually better than his ""One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"") and the playwright of ""Equus"" (which I have never seen) teamed up to produce one of the most powerful, lasting movies ever imagined.""Amadeus"" is the story of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart through the eyes of his greatest rival, Antonio Salieri. The odd thing is, neither character is inherently likable. Mozart is a disgusting slacker and Salieri is a whiny, jealous outcast. What makes the film entertaining is that precise fact... and the great portrayals by Tom Hulce and F. Murray Abraham, respectively.Also astounding is the look of the film, shot in Prague (you'd never know it wasn't really Vienna) with design by Patrizia von Brandenstein and Josef Svoboda. No backlot shoots for ""Amadeus,"" thank you very much.I could go on and on and on about the great performances (even by bewildering faces, like Jeffrey ""Principal Rooney"" Jones and Christine Ebersole), beautiful music adaptation, and incomparable dialogue, but they speak for themselves. All you have to know is that ""Amadeus"" will either be the masterpiece you've heard, or it will exceed your expectations.As the tagline promises, ""Everything you've heard is true."""
SMEGOFF-1,"Feb 4, 2002",N/A,"What can i say that hasn't already been said? It's a fantastic film, and i can look past the historical inaccuracies. Peter Shaffer never intended it to be a 'documentary', it's a drama. Just as Pushkin (I think it was him!) wrote a play called ""Mozart and Salieri"" on how salieri had poisoned Mozart, which in the day was a popular rumour (since disproved). It's entertaining and spectacular to watch, even if you aren't a big fan of classical music. I think it's a wonderful way to bring it to the masses...after all i saw the film first when i was 13 and it spawned my now 10 year obsession with Mozart and his music. Salieri i can relate to. Who hasn't felt the desire to do something but felt inadequate ""Why implant the desire like a lust in my body, and then make me mute?""...salieri ignoring the fact that he himself was quite talented...i certainly can't write an opera, he wrote 40! I love the depiction of Salieri's battle with God, and the title could not be more appropriate ""Amadeus"" which means, beloved of God. You can empathize with both characters, Abraham and Hulce give such depth to the characters. We see that Mozart is a childish, vulgar man, in his outward attitude but when it comes to his music he is nothing but sublime and beautiful. Salieri is an insecure, talented man who seems to feel sort of like the 2nd favourite child. The scene near the end when Mozart is composing the Requiem is almost breathtaking. It lends to the imagination what the composition process might've been like for Wolfi, but most importantly it demonstrates the complex layers of Mozart's music and how well they all fit together. He writes beautiful melodies, but the structure of his music as a whole is what makes it truly amazing ""misplace one note...and the structure would fall""."
fh147,"Dec 27, 2023",7/10,"I like this movie even if I didn't like how the wife performance filled a bit flat most of the time and I had to remember that this was based on a conspiracy theory and it's not real history even if it has a lot of real history in it.Interpreting I didn't really know who to root for but slowly I realized that villain composer was really entertaining and enjoyed every morni. He has of his speechos spiteful relationship with Mozart it is just so fun to ride him torture this guy who totally does not deserve it.And that portrayal of Mozart was really good. In the beginning I hated him I wanted him to suffer because he was such an insufferable break, but I begin to get sympathy for him and he was really sad when he slowly got tortured .What I enjoyed most about the performances was how over the top they could be like. Seeing the most angry Frau on a person and Mozart making the most hilarious laughs. It just went to 10 most of the time which were amazing for this time period because it feels like it was a play for how what's the top everything was.The way the characters act to the music love it. They want every minute of it. I could feel it and I enjoyed classic. I never like before because of their reaction to it.Please watch it even if it is 3 hours Long."
tj_director,"Feb 26, 2003",2/10,"now most classics, i can very well agree with their status, but this one i just can't understand why it's so acclaimed.. critics love bringing down any historical film down to it's artistic licences, but i'm amazed at how this one is so over-missed.. now come on Mozart speaking in an American accent, and most of the cast using contemporary dialogue.. i don't care how great the subject matter or production design is.. but really i can't overlook that fact.. A Knight's Tale having a moment where they sing Queen's 'We Will Rock You' i can enjoy, that film isn't taking itself entirely serious.. but Amadeus is!!! and there cast using american accents and contemporary dialogue in film set in Europe hundereds of years ago, is one of the biggest plot points i could think of.. i just couldn't take the film seriously, and it was pretty boring.i'm not some ignorant movie goer either.. in fact i know a hell of a lot, so don't think i'm some 14yr old movie buff wannabe..This film is seriously over-rated. Milos Forman has made many a great film (Cukoo's Nest, Larry Flynt, Man On The Moon [all set in the 20th Century i might add!]), but this in my mind was one of his absolute worst.. it's as if he was lazy enough to just leave the boom mike in shot the whole time, and leave in sounds of the crew working behind camera. .it's just that ignorant a film.It has enough fans (and oscars), that i don't think my blasting of it is going to hurt it one bit, but if you're REALLY serious about films, (and i don't just mean someone who watches a lot of films, but someone who thinks about films every other second of the day) don't go into this movie thinking it's the absolute masterpiece everyone makes it out out to be, it just isn't... the accents and dialogue totally overshadow what could have been a truly great film! because everything else is top notch.. but i can't forgive such easy and obvious mistakes in such a high profile film!!!"
paalrune,"Nov 17, 2001",9/10,"I never cared much for the music of Mozart until Forman made this brilliant film. Tom Hulce draws a believiable (sic!) portrait of an artist at work, while F. Murray Abraham is the incarnation of the evilness in man.  Having seen the movie again and again I still cry at the end scene accompanied by Mozarts own soundtrack ""Lacrimosa""Unbearably beatiful."
graemehill,"Aug 20, 2001",9/10,"Do not miss this film. It is wonderful in every way. F. Murray Abraham is great in his role, and Tom Hulce is hysterical and heart breaking. The supporting cast is also amazing, as usual Jeffrey Jones proves himself an extremely worthy asset and Milan Demjanenko, as Mozart's father, is chilling. One movie that was the right choice for Best Picture!"
anthonyx,"Jan 29, 2001",10/10,"i've read alot of peoples comments on this movie and the only real negative comment was that it was historically inaccurate.  it is a movie!! who cares!! if every movie was historically accurate, everything will be plain boring.  having said that, it was the only negative comment about this movie.  it was highly entertaining, even my brother with an attention span of a 12yo was taken by this marvellous peice of film.  exceptional performances by f murray abraham and tom hulce, an entertaining storyline, along with mozarts brilliant music made this movie a 10/10 for alot of people including myself.i started learning classical music/piano because of beethoven, but i fell in love with classical music because of mozart and this movie which i watched as a youngester.  they had picked out a great selection of mozart music for the soundtrack, showing a range of mozarts talents.this movie is my #1 drama movie of all time, i could not recommend a better movie to anyone looking for great drama that appeals to both sexes."
galileo3,"Dec 31, 2005",10/10,"Amadeus (1984)Number 1 - 1984Top 5 - 1980sTop 50 - All TimeAmadeus is a superb film, featuring unforgettable scenes, great acting and sublime classical music. The film is told by Antonio Salieri a now insane musician who was the finest in the city until Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart arrived with his perfect music. A true genius he was, but his character and manners were crude and rude. Winner of 8 Academy Awards Including Best Picture, Best Director Milos Forman, Best Actor F.Murray Abraham. From the director of 'One flew over the Cuckoo's Nest', Amadeus is an inspiring, wonderful, dark, colourful film. ""simply breathtaking""Amadeus is spellbinding, amazing, sublime: Forman has visualised 18th Century Vienna in breathtaking fashion; but beside all the sets and costumes, it is the characters and more simply the performances. F. Murray Abraham provides an exquisitely calculated, graceful, masterful performance that won him the Oscar. Furthermore, Tom Hulce, who plays Mozart is also astonishing.Classical music, stunning direction, breathtaking acting, lavish sets, extravagant costumes and a story that is beautifully woven into all the grandeur of this film; what can I say this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen. Amadeus belongs on my top 5 list. Superlative, sublime cinematic mastery.I initially gave the film a 9/10 and raised to 10, because I believe Amadeus is as a movie critic put it: ""as close to perfection as movies get""10/10"
tickboy,"Oct 2, 2000",10/10,"I rank this movie as my all-time favorite; not only because I am a lover of classical music, but also because of the quality of the film.  Perhaps the greatest aspect involves the editing.  None of Mozart's music is changed or revised in any way from the original.  All the editing of the film was structured around maintaining that consistency.  F. Murray Abraham's performance was one of the best of his career.  He portrays his emotions vividly and gives the viewer a true sense of what it must have been like to be a musician in Mozart's time.  I believe this movie to be well-worth renting, owning, and showing to any and all who have never seen it."
rchalloner,"Jun 10, 2006",10/10,"This is for me quite simply, the best movie ever made. The acting, photography, costumes, settings and screenplay are all top notch. Milos Forman brings the world of Mozart to life and all the characters are beautifully cast. I can't think of a single performance that wasn't spot on, which says a lot. F.Murray Abraham in particular gives arguably the greatest performance in movie history as Antonio Salieri. He manages wonderfully to convey the pathos and contradictions of his character, caught as he is between admiration and hatred for Mozart, between his humility and passion for music and his consuming envy of the foul mouthed little genius who outshines him. Practically every scene is a masterpiece. Add to that the music of Mozart, Salieri, Haydn and others and you have a recipe for sheer perfection. The proof of that is that it never loses its magic no matter how many times one sees it,which is the ultimate test of a great movie."
Rusalkathewaternymph,"Jun 23, 2003",N/A,"Of course, when Amadeus came out in the theaters, it was hailed as a triumph on just about every level.  It followed the prototype of big, splashy epic-like films of the early to mid-1980's (Gandhi, Out of Africa, Chariots of Fire) but this one was a bit different from all the others.  Not only was it a film about a real person, the back-bone of the film itself was its music.  And what glorious music it is!Amadeus was based on the stage play of the same name by British playwright Peter Shaffer.  It opened in New York in 1980 and starred Tim Curry as Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.  It won the 1980 Tony Award for Best Play and so it would only be a matter of time before Hollywood would come to call. Everything about the life story of Mozart cries out to be told in a grand epic-like film style and structure.  From the origins of Mozart's travails as he attempts to be Court Composer to Emperor Joseph the II of Austria to the writing of what some consider his finest work, the Requiem mass, it's all here.  Of course, as we all (should) know by now, much of Amadeus as both play and film is highly fictionalized.  Shaffer does a grand thing by having us want to believe the fact that Antonio Salieri actually kills Mozart, but in the end it is up to our imaginations to wonder if we are seeing the truth or not.Recently, the Director's Cut was released with an additional twenty minutes of footage cut from the original (1984) release.  If anything, the newly recovered footage draws out the story, but it also puts a bit more meat onto the bones of the life of whom many people think is the world's greatest composer of classical music.  We leave the theater (or the couch) feeling sated in our quest but always wondering could it have been true...or is this merely a great fiction just sculpted to look as if it was meant to be true.Amadeus was nominated for eleven Academy Awards, winning eight including Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Direction, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Set and Costume Design, Best Sound and Best Makeup. It was also nominated for Best Cinematography and Best Film Editing.My rating: 3 and a half stars"
acbryan,"Dec 3, 2001",10/10,"Amadeus is cinematic perfection.  I admit I have concluded Amadeus to be my favorite motion picture of all time.  Start to finish, this film is filled with so much.  I will attempt to name just a few of it's greater elements.Firstly, after reading a couple of serious, highly regarded and obviously heavily researched biographies of Wolfgang Mozart, I was shocked and pleased to discover that Peter Schaeffer and Milos Forman had clearly not only done mountains of research to perfect their sketch of this man, but these two men interpolated every little known nuance with exquisite perfection.  Thanks to them, Mozart is alive as real on the screen as if he were alive passing you by on the avenue today.  True, there are historical inaccuracies, but clearly they meant as artistic liberties, taken to create drama and flow (they demonstrate such intimate knowledge of all the little details that they are allowed to skew the big details).  The important point is that the composite picture of this man is a brilliant recreation of real life, to the best of anyone's knowledge.The acting is remarkable.  Not only are F. Murray Abraham's rushes unforgettable and poignant, but there are so many apparent accidents with respect to other casting choices.  Hulce's uncanny portrayal is exactly as one would have imagined him after reading any of the serious bios, to say nothing of that mad cackle.  Tom Hulce, of course, is not a prolific screen actor, but this rare performance is so incredibly strong, it is as if his entire life were tailor-made for it, and his contribution to cinema is as great as any actor's simply with this one role.  Roy Dotrice as Leopold Mozart is another seemingly accidental perfection.  Leopold is played with the precise mixture of intelligence, love, misery, and pathos to be the composite of how the real man is written about.  Once again, it is as if every player had done exhaustive research, conceptualized and made their character's lives part of their own psyche so that they act and react to new situations as if they were that person.  As for Jeffrey Jones as the Emperor, he was just wickedly funny.  All in all, the acting is simply astounding.The music of Mozart has been selected for the soundtrack by true masters. The pieces used are dazzling and truly encapsulate that dichotomous sense of bliss and horror that Mozart always strove to capture.  The music leaves Mozart-neophytes yearning for more, and long-time Mozart fans cheering their favorites.  When I first watched Amadeus, I belonged to the former group. I am now proud to say I belong to the latter, and when I re-screen Amadeus, I do cheer and weep tears of joy, bliss and shiver with terror at the marvelous orchestrations.  Salieri's analysis of the music is also fascinating, if subjective.The choice of Prague as the shooting location was brilliant.  Prague in 1983 (when this film was shot) was still part of the Eastern Block of countries and, as such, was untouched and unhindered by the West.  It's cobble-stone streets, cathedrals and tenements all still stood as they did in the eighteenth century, (and in all likelihood, as they did in the fifteenth century) without the desecration of Western-style neon signs, modern architecture or other such telling signs of the twentieth century.  In other words, it is the  perfect character to play eighteenth century Vienna; in a sense, another excellent casting choice.  Together with the flawless costume design, and all the perfectly selected character actors and bit players, the deception is complete.  We are all hypnotized into believing we have arrived in Vienna c. 1780's.I love every frame of Amadeus.  The plot takes liberties, of course, but that is the very nature of cinema.  Besides the above elements, the content is full of rich and substantial themes and sub-themes, leading the audience to further provocation: hatred, anger, mediocrity, the nature of savants, prodigy, beauty, envy, vengeance, the differences between (Salieri's fleeting) form (of fame) and (Mozart's lasting) substance (of fame), and the list continues."
