hitchcockthelegend,"Aug 26, 2010",9/10,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut of director and writer Quentin Tarantino. It stars Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, and Lawrence Tierney. Tarantino has a minor role, as does criminal-turned-author Eddie Bunker.It feels a bit silly to write it now, but there was a time when Reservoir Dogs barely made a ripple in the cinema loving world; in America that is. Upon its release in the States it was moderately successful and comfortably made back its $1.2 million budget. However, upon hitting the British shores it was a big hit and grossed nearly £6.5 million and then Pulp Fiction exploded on the world in 94 and Reservoir Dogs got reappraised in its home country. The rest as they say is history.Tarantino, the most enthusiastic of film fans, was once a video store clerk in Redondo Beach. There he dreamed of making his own movies and planned to make Reservoir Dogs with his friends on a relatively small budget. As luck would have it, Keitel got hold of the script and wanted in. With his name attached, and using his contacts, a serious budget was raised and so the Dogs were set loose. At the time of its popularity, Tarantino had to guardedly fend off accusations of plagiarism and a charge of just hacking from older classic heist movies. His argument was that he was making his own homage to the heist caper, but even so, the fact remains that Reservoir Dogs is spliced from The Killing, Kansas City Confidential, The Big Combo, The Taking Of Pelham One Two Three and we can definitely throw in The Asphalt Jungle as well.Yet Reservoir Dogs is still extraordinarily fresh and vibrant, raising the bar for crime movies in the modern era. Tarantino of course has since gone on to prove his worth with other projects, so in truth his homage movie was merely the foot in the door for the talented son of Knoxville, Tennessee. In terms of its dialogue, tho, and its gleeful use of ""ultra-violence,"" it has few peers. From any decade. It also helps considerably that Tarantino has assembled a quality cast to make his non-linear classic shine. Keitel is a given, but Roth is exceptional, as too is Buscemi, while Madsen is frighteningly convincing as psycho for hire Mr. Blonde. Then there's the 70s soundtrack, a vital part of the narrative as we hear the dulcet tones of Steven Wright Djing on K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies. If you have not seen the film yet? Then I promise you will remember Stealers Wheel-Stuck in the Middle for the rest of your cinema loving days.And that's the thing with Reservoir Dogs, it's crammed packed full of memorable things. A quip, a bang, a song or the WTF ending, as homages go; it's one of the very best. 9/10"
AlsExGal,"Jan 18, 2021",8/10,"... because the first time around I was somewhat disappointed. This was actually a commercial hit for Tarantino , and that usually means something that is appreciated on the first view.It is great nonlinear storytelling. You first meet these guys in a diner having breakfast. And you learn lots about their characters just from this very mundane setting and some arguing about the philosophy of tipping. And you wonder why they are wearing suits and thin lapels with white shirts and skinny ties, like they borrowed the Beatles' 1964 wardrobe. It is never explained. And there is all of this 70s music, again, never explained.Storywise it has been done a hundred times, maybe more. A heist gone wrong. But the gimmick is, you never SEE the heist. Most of the time I like for movie makers to show me not tell me, but this works brilliantly. You see this gang of people who do not know each other talk about the heist beforehand. You see the aftermath of the heist. You see the descriptions of the heist between this band of criminals not exactly matching up. And all of the scenes are mixed up chronologically. Where it shines is the crazy dialogue that happens between these hooligans. Their banter is ludicrous, villainous, and totally engaging. It's like Diner meets Dillinger.And speaking of Dillinger, a really great touch is having Lawrence Tierney in a supporting role as Joe, mastermind of the heist. Tierney was an actual star of film noirs in the 1940s, and he lost that career because in real life he was somebody who would probably have been quite at home with the characters in this film. He got into lots of bar fights and altercations with the police to the point that no studio wanted to deal with him anymore.I'd highly recommend this one, but you must pay attention to get the most out of it."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 31, 2006",8/10,"After watching this half a dozen times with a biased, anti-Tarantino, ""what the heck is so great about this guy, anyway"" view(which, as most anyone watching any film with that view and a fair bit of self-knowledge will tell you, is a rather fruitless practice in pointlessness... if you've decided you're not going to like it, there's very little reason to think that you will, no matter how good it is; you need an open mind), I finally decided to give it a fair hearing... and I saw it for what it is. An unusual film, at least for its time. A stylish film full of cool dialog, cinematography, editing and music. The whole thing comes together perfectly and is very short of creating a sublime film experience. The plot is excellently written and told. The pace is perfect. I wasn't bored for a second, nor did I ever really want it to move faster or slower. The cinematography is magnificent, and incredibly well-integrated. Pans, dolly trips and, lest we forget, the stationary shots... all perfectly used. Very stylized. The acting is top-notch all-round. With most of the cast being name actors, this is no surprise, but they really do shine. Madsen, Buscemi, Keitel, Roth... all incredible. The one role that had less than good... well, let's be honest, it had rather awful acting. I'm speaking, of course, of Tarantino's character. Now, don't get me wrong; in From Dusk Till Dawn, this man did great. But just about any other time I've seen him act, he just doesn't seem to have the first clue. Being a film-maker myself(albeit on somewhat of a smaller scale than Quentin), I can relate to wanting to cast yourself in a role... but sometimes, you just need to face up to the facts, and admit it if you can't act. Still, that is a minor complaint. Another one might be that there are at least two fairly big characters that seem completely and entirely expendable... they had no real role in the action and could very, very easily have been cut with no real loss to the overall product. I won't name them here, but anyone who's seen the film will know who I'm talking about. All the characters, however, are well-written and their actions credible. Tarantino knows his stuff when it comes to writing... something that also shows in the dialog, which, although somewhat drawn-out at times, is exceptional. Well-delivered, too. When it comes to direction, he shows how talented he is, as well. The film is very well put together. The editing is great, with the non-linear time-line telling the story far better than a ""regular"" film ever could. One of the many Tarantino-fans, in fact, the very person who originally talked me into watching this film, once told me that he had heard of someone editing films with such time-lines - this, Pulp Fiction, Memento, etc. - so that their time-lines were perfectly linear. I'm sorry, I entirely respect their right to do such a thing... and I won't claim that their doing so has less artistic value than the original films in any way... but I refuse to watch that. A big part of this being so well-told lies in the time-line. Also, I'm a firm believer of watching something the way the makers intended it. Don't edit, don't censor, don't make your own version and pass it off as anything but just that... your own version, and not the original. Sorry, rant over. Finally, I just need to comment on the music... the soundtrack of this is just great. Tarantino collected so many amazing 70's tunes for this film and used them great. All in all, just a really, really good film. Very little keeps this from being a perfect ten, most of which I've covered here. I recommend this to anyone who can stomach the violence and who likes their films with a side of style. 8/10"
Anonymous_Maxine,"Aug 18, 2000",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs is a testament to the idea that ""less is more."" This doesn't apply to the violence, the film is extremely violent from beginning to end, but the details of the botched diamond heist, which the entire film is based on, are conveyed only in the dialogue, except for one scene where Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) recalls his escape. The whole film takes place after the failed robbery is over, and the mystery that unfolds among the criminal participants is amazing to watch.This is not a normal crime film. The thing that really sets Reservoir Dogs apart from all of the others is that it is PURE. When you look at the screen, you're looking at reality. There are no Hollywood actors, there's no make-up to make them look pretty, there's little to no comic relief, and most important of all, there's no goofy romantic subplot clumsily thrown in, a detrimental trademark of so many action films, as well as  virtually all Jerry Bruckheimer films. Instead of all of that garbage, Tarantino decided to just present the film as simply and straightforwardly as possible, and by doing that he makes it seem that you're really looking at a bunch of criminals trying to figure out what to do after a suspiciously failed robbery.Even though most of the actors were known at the time this film was made, the film was delivered in such a way that you don't see the actors at all, you only see the brutal characters that they portray. It is genuinely frightening to imagine being in the same room with any of them, and this is a quality that is rarely achieved in any kind of film.Make no mistake, Reservoir Dogs is among the most violent films ever made, and some scenes are really painful to watch, but the way that reality is captured is something that justifies the violent excesses in this film. The violence is never glorified, nor is the criminal lifestyle. When films are overly violent, they usually get branded as such, but despite the extreme violence, Reservoir Dogs still manages to deliver an important overall message about the consequences of your actions. It remains high on the growing list of Tarantino's classic films, and it will not be soon forgotten."
jeleach,"Sep 5, 2002",N/A,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama.  The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession.  Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal.  Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang.  The delight is in meeting these characters one by one.  The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up.  The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime.  Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked.  The director has included a number of very memorable scenes.  This is not a linear film.  The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing.  This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."
ronnay_barkay,"Jul 15, 2005",10/10,"The first time I saw Reservoir Dogs, I was about 15, it had been banned in my country, and I heard it was extremely voilent. Naturally I did everything in my power to get my paws on a copy, and when I finally did see it, I was disappointed. I was just sitting there saying ""Wheres all the violence"", Anyway, I watched it till the end, and then I watched it again, and since then it has just grew on me.This is one of the movies I don't get bored watching time and time again. I still watch it at least once a year, because its not the kind of movie you watch to unwind or to pass the time. You simply watch it for the sheer quality and originality of the movie. The one liners are classic: ""Are you gonna bark all day..."", ""I'll make you my dog's bitch"". Mr.Blonde is totally believable as a psycho. I mean who stops to get fries and soda just after committing a robbery? The fact that everything is ludicrous, but you don't know this because these guys, and the way they talk is so impossibly cool that you just accept it. This movie is all about the dialog. The violence is used sparingly, and to better effect. The way the film is edited is genius. Its almost like you forget the whole movie after you watch it, and the next time you watch it, there's a whole scene that you forgot was there. The storyline is unpredictable and thrilling. This is better that Pulp Fiction and in my opinion definitely Tarintino's best movie. I didn't care much for the ""Kill Bill"" movies, but who cares, I'm not reviewing them.If you haven't seen Reservoir Dogs, just rent it, buy it or steal it right now."
mrmoustache0420,"Jul 17, 2002",10/10,"This is without a doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen and definately deserves its position on the Top 250. It's an acquired taste, but if you've been desensitised to violence (as i have), then you will want to watch this again from the minute it ends. Every single actor was perfectly fitted for its character. Steve Buscemi as the squirrely Mr. Pink, Harvey Keitel as the veteran Mr. White, and of course, Michael Madsen as the phsycotic Mr. Blonde. The list goes on and on.Some people said that the violence was unnecessary and didn't move the plot forward as it did with Pulp Fiction. I agree, but the violence was used to develop the character's personalities. It showed their disregard for human life and that our anti-heros saw killing a cop as being as stepping on a cockroach .I urge future viewers of this movie not to instantly compare it to Pulp Fiction and enjoy it as it's own film. An interesting thrill-ride crime drama from beginning to end, I give this film *****/*****"
brandonennals,"Dec 17, 2004",10/10,"I watched this movie for the first time without knowing what the movie was about. I remember hearing about how cool this movie was and I saw people wearing shirts and listening to the soundtrack, but I had never seen it. So when it first came out on DVD, I bought it without ever watching it before. In Tarantino I trust. For good reason. This is a classic movie, a throwback. A movie about a jewel heist gone wrong and the consequences of working with strangers. This flick has a great cast, great script, and flawless direction. Taratino films are great because they stress the story more than anything else. In all of his movies, the script is strong enough to carry the movie. Now add good over the top acting and you have a hit. The realism of this movie is what grabs you. You really feel like you are in that abandoned warehouse. If felt privileged to have bought such a movie without watching it first. An instant classic. I love this movie!"
Xstal,"Oct 16, 2022",7/10,"Mr Blonde has quite a nasty disposition, always eager to assist in a transition, from alive to being dead, he likes to cut and instil dread, a psychopathic, murdering, clinician. Mr Pink is quite uptight most all the time, as for tipping, wouldn't even leave a dime, continually he frets, he's quite feeble and quite wet, doesn't trust another soul when doing crime. Mr White can be quite tough but can be kind, not afraid to let you know what's on his mind, he can be the voice of reason, tries to add to the cohesion, though his finger's on the trigger and always primed.Several colourfully named rogues regroup after a failed heist and leave you wondering why Mr Orange wasn't called Mr Blood Orange."
SeminolePhenom,"Oct 7, 2005",10/10,"Four of six ruthless criminals await for their boss at an abandoned warehouse. After finding the diamond heist that they had all teamed up to accomplish was a trap, they realize that one of them is a police informant.The movie is told through a series of flashbacks from each of the criminals. I have never seen this done so breathtakingly. ""Dogs"" is an absolute masterpiece. It may not be Tarantino's best but is definitely one of the greatest movies of all time. There is absolutely nothing between the satirical writing or the hard-to-watch murders that could possibly make the movie any more perfect. Overall, the movie is absolutely incredible and I do not wish to say anymore to give away any sense of the ending.I highly recommend this movie."
zcpgjdps,"Feb 17, 2021",7/10,"The plot itself calls for a great movie, but much like many other tarantino films is filled with extended unnecessary/off topic dialogue, which bores and essentially takes away from the plot."
datorsiers2,"Aug 26, 2015",3/10,"Looking at the high rating of 8,4 and knowing that this is considered one of Quentin Tarantino's best movies i thought i was about to see a great masterpiece.I was absolutely shocked about how terribly boring this movie was. There is no progression in the plot at all, they didn't even show a second of the robbery the movie was about. For the first 50 minutes of the movie the viewer just sits through completely irrelevant and boring scenes, experiences next to no action and just gets bored, since nobody is presented with who is who in the first half of the film. It is impossible to be compassionate for the characters, since you don't even know who they are and all you see is just a bunch of useless drawn-out conversations, using a lot of useless sentences just to add to the screen time, which is only 99 minutes, by the way.The movie uses a lot of excessively drawn-out conversations, it is not necessarily a bad thing, but here it didn't fit, since the screen time is so short, leading into a very boring plot and irrelevant actions. I don't get what people see in this movie, yea the acting is OK, but otherwise, it is just garbage. Is it only because it is Tarantino? Is that everything people need to hear to give a positive review? I get that many people see this movie as ''different'' just to show others they enjoyed it, it would be awesome if everybody wasn't afraid of expressing their opinion and sticking to it.Overall a terrible movie, don't see that as a classic for sure, would not watch again nor recommend it to anybody else. Short, no action, zero plot progression, drawn-out irrelevant conversations, boring."
bob the moo,"Jan 28, 2004",N/A,"Crime boss Joe Cabot brings together a group of criminals to perform a big one-off job.  To protect each other, they all use colour coded names. However on the day of the job, the police ambush the gang and each makes their own getaway.  As the gang comes together at their warehouse meeting point they realise that someone within the gang must have tipped the police or be an undercover.  The accusations and suspicions escalate into violence in the confines of the warehouse.When this film came out in the UK it caused an absolute firestorm of controversy over it's violence, even to the point that it was banned in the UK for a while.  I still find this absurd and am very glad we have moved to a more tolerant society where generally the BBFC protect vulnerable groups but let adults decide for themselves.  Looking at the media's adoring welcome for the ultra violent Kill Bill one can't help but marvel at how things have changed.  Looking at Reservoir Dogs now (or even then!) it simply isn't THAT violent.  However what it is is very sudden and all the more powerful for it.Tarantino directs the film and writes the film in such a way that it was impossible to ignore him even if the film was only a cult hit.  The dialogue is both witty at points but, more importantly, very tough and loaded with testosterone.  It is the writing that makes us like these coffee shop jokers at the start before shocking us by suddenly throwing us into a backseat bloodbath.  The entire job happens off camera, and only occasionally do we actually see the immediate effect of violence - usually we get the aftermath.  It is incredibly tight and very tense throughout, I was about 16 when my father took me to see this film - it has stayed with me since and I still considered it to be one of the best `job gone wrong' films of my generation.  It may not be original (there's a thin line between a homage and a rip off) but it is certainly effectively done.The cast are excellent and turn the hardboiled dialogue into convincing scenes.  Keitel is wonderful.  His character is a father figure of sorts and he is wildly out of control at times and balanced at others.  Likewise Buscemi is wide-eyed and freaking out for much of the film, but he does it well.  Roth is more balanced but is still good for it; it is his job to carry the emotional weight of the film and he does it well, despite a wandering American accent at times.  Madsen is great, maybe not the best character but wildly out of control.  Tierney was a great piece of casting, as was Bunker.  Penn is good but not the best of the cast.Tarantino mercifully has little acting to do, but it is his film as writer and director.  The flashbacks during the film was a brave way to do it but it really works well - mixing stories with flashbacks and so on.  No matter what the time of the scene, it all keeps moving tensely towards the climax. It may be a homage and not as original as some films but so what - it is tight and tense, macho, violent, funny and very enjoyable."
SnoopyStyle,"Jan 3, 2016",8/10,A group of men are having benign banter in a diner. They have color code names. Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) brings a horribly wounded Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) back to the hideout. Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) is ranting about the quick police response as a setup. Joe Cabot hired the crew for a diamond store holdup keeping their identities secret from each other. Calm and disturbed Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) shows up with a captured cop.Quentin Tarantino deconstructs the crime movie by concentrating on the in-between scenes. He peppers the scenes with sharp extraneous dialog. It makes for some really memorable scenes. The diner scene and the torture scene are unforgettable. The whole movie does drag as we wait for the actual robbery action scenes but this movie is something completely different.
CharltonBoy,"Jan 3, 2002",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs will always go down as one of the most violent yet brilliant pieces of work ever to be shown on the silver screen. Tarrentino's script is brilliant and what is even more amazing is that it is his first movie. The acting is top grade , all the actors seem to come up with the performance of lives. There were calls when the film was released for it to be banned by the lilly livered liberals and while this is bloody and the language is coarse, for it to be banned would have deprived us of a classic Hollywood movie that oozes class as well as blood! 10 out of 10"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 3, 2023",10/10,"A jewel robbery at a store should be a simple task for a gang if hardened criminals, but the plan goes horribly wrong, prompting the members to think that one of them is a Police informant.Where to even begin with this film, there's no doubt about it, it's one of Quentin Tarantino's best, it's exciting, thrilling, uncomfortable and funny, it really does offer something for everyone.It's quite a simple storyline when you think of it, but it's the incredible character play that makes it so incredible, Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney and Tim Roth all fabulous.It's Michael Madsen who steals it for me, that dance scene is just incredible, that whole sequence is unnerving, unsettling, violent and just brilliant.It's loaded with classic scenes, the torture of that poor Policeman is the highlight, and of course that wonderful big reveal is terrific,The music is superb throughout, you'll be reaching for the tracklist after the credits roll.10/10."
fredrikgunerius,"Oct 15, 2025",10/10,"The urgency and immediacy of Quentin Tarantino's debut feature remain as outstanding now several years after its release as in 1992. And it becomes increasingly evident how revolutionary the film was for more than one genre in American filmmaking, though most notably the crime and action genres. Tarantino strips down every convention and presents a structurally refreshing, narratively ambitious piece that looks, feels, and smells like a free-standing, liberated work of art.The inspiration comes from '70s crime movies, but there is nothing in the film reminiscent of the more embroidered forms of tribute Tarantino paid later on in his career. Reservoir Dogs has its heart in the '70s and clearly distances itself from the conventionalism and lack of realism that typified '80s action. As an artistic expression, it is pure innovation. Tarantino combines a clever, well-tangled story with a completely unbiased and deeply insightful look into the human psyche. He manages to create energizingly authentic characters, even if their coolness is the first priority, and he constantly balances them on the edge between hero and villain. In remarkable fashion, Tarantino explores the nuances and borderlines between good and bad that arise in most situations in life - and he does it all while delivering an absorbing and atmospheric crime story.Although Tarantino didn't gain unanimous praise until Pulp Fiction two years later, it was with Reservoir Dogs that he created the stylistic universe that has come to define him. And it has never been more impetuous than here, running through the entire production - from compositions to thematics and narrative. There is a boldness and timelessness to this picture that can only stem from an ingenious, visionary filmmaker at his dawn. Going from a fifteen-minute completely inspirational conversation about nothingness to filming neo-poetic realism is a hallmark of this. The casting is sheer genius as well, combining old and new talent while replacing a traditional lead character with a small ensemble of character actors. They are all brilliant, but Harvey Keitel stands out in particular. Reservoir Dogs was a renaissance for him and a seminal work for the greatest filmmaker of our time."
moviewizguy,"Feb 3, 2007",7/10,"A gang of thieves carry out an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse. The police are after them so quickly that they suspect they have a rat in their company. This film starts right after the robbery, with flashbacks to before the robbery, and to the planning of the crime.After reading this plot, you know this is not your average crime film. In fact, I thought this film was about the whole diamond heist and that there will be a twist ending on who's the rat. It's absolutely nothing like that.Although an original way to make this film, this film is mostly boring, with an exception on the prologue of the film which I found entertaining for some reason. This film is very violent and bloody with shooting here and there and yelling about this and that. That's about it with the film.There's nothing interesting with the ""boring"" characters and ""bad"" story. The actings were relatively decent and this film is nowhere near one of the best films ever, although many people said it was, which lead me to buy the film on DVD, which I found a complete waste of money. One good thing about this film is that it's unpredictable and has funny jokes, which in real life would be just the opposite.This film is decent but not a very good film. It has some originality and clever humor but all squished with a boring plot and uninteresting characters. This is just my opinion but I should say for those who want to see this film should rent it first before buying."
gough-84368,"Apr 16, 2022",8/10,"This film has me from the opening diner scene. The dialogue makes the characters feel real and intricate. Their actions are explained through their personality, keeping continuity. The film isn't too long to too short, at times conversation can feel a little drawn out. Although, it all makes sense in the end. The film is violent and but it isn't corny, no one is invincible. The weight of bullets and blood is heavy in the film. I'd recommend this flick to anyone that can stomach blood and especially to fans of crime dramas."
maccas-56367,"Oct 7, 2019",3/10,"It's official. I don't like Tarantino movies. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the most overrated movies I've seen in a long time. Even the awesome soundtrack couldn't salvage some level of enjoyment from me.Steve Buscemi was great as he usually is. But beyond that, there just wasn't much I liked here. I love some violence and swearing as much as the next person. But here, I can't help thinking Tarantino used it in such way as to draw attention away from the fact there isn't much below the surface of this film.People love over-indulgent, long guitar solos in songs - and Tarantino movies often feel like the film-making version of that. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is no exception. This felt like some end-of-year final assessment in film school or drama class. I don't watch films for their technical aspects. My attention waned numerous times throughout overly long scenes and lengthy dialogue that had no purpose. ""12 Angry Men"" is an excellent example of how to do that in a way that is both artistic and entertaining. This is not.The use of flashbacks and change in timelines didn't do anything to keep me engaged either. The bare resemblance of a storyline just felt soulless and depressing, with it seemingly going nowhere. Unfortunately, far too often people consider yelling to be acting at its finest and most dramatic. The love for this movie and Tarantino movies in general will forever be the big mystery of cinema for me."
Infofreak,"Jun 5, 2002",N/A,"It's hard to get your head around the fact that 'Reservoir Dogs' has been around for ten years. It's almost difficult to remember a time before Tarantino made such an enormous impact (good and bad) on movies, but I saw this movie first time round before the hype. All I knew was that, like another ""dog"" movie from the same era that I saw, 'Man Bites Dog', that it was supposed to be violent, funny and disturbing, and that it starred a long time favourite of mine Harvey Keitel, and Tim Roth, who I mainly knew from Greenaway's 'The Cook The Thief His Wife & Her Lover'. Okay, I hope it's good I thought as I waited in the cinema listening to some half remembered 70s A.M. pop and a strange conversation about Madonna's sex life (the cinema was playing the soundtrack album before the main feature, but what did we know). Then the movie itself, electrifying and fascinating from the word go. It's impossible to describe the impact of seeing this for the first time without knowing what to expect! Still one of my greatest movie memories. Ten years later I've seen it countless times so the surprise has obviously worn off, but it is still a brilliant movie because beneath the violence and wise-cracks of Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi - 'In The Soup'), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen - 'Thelma & Louise'), and Nice Guy Eddie (Chris Penn - 'At Close Range'), there is a lot of  depth, that being the very human relationship between Mr. White (Keitel) and Mr.Orange (Roth). To me that is one of the things that elevates this above the many lame and unoriginal ""Tarantinoesque"" movies we've had to endure since 'Pulp Fiction'. His imitators just simply don't have a clue!Simply brilliant cinema, and a modern classic. This is absolutely essential viewing!"
chiragrathod09,"Jul 19, 2024",8/10,"Quentin Tarantino's *Reservoir Dogs* is not merely a film, it's a gripping exploration of loyalty, betrayal, and the stark shadows of moral ambiguity that permeate the criminal underworld. Released in 1992, this independent gem astonished audiences with its clever non-linear storytelling, sharp dialogue, and a unique ensemble cast that breathes life into unforgettable characters.The film opens with a group of criminals, each given a color-coded nickname to protect their identities during a heist gone terribly wrong. The brilliance lies in how Tarantino constructs his narrative, flipping back and forth in time, unveiling character backstories alongside the unraveling events of the heist itself. This approach not only keeps viewers on the edge of their seats but also allows for a deep dive into the psychology of each character, from the enigmatic Mr. White to the volatile Mr. Pink.What sets *Reservoir Dogs* apart is its razor-sharp dialogue, infused with pop culture references and darkly humorous exchanges that add depth and distinction to the film's intensity. Tarantino's script features moments that oscillate seamlessly between light-hearted banter and nail-biting tension, making the interactions among the characters feel strikingly real - and painfully relatable.The performances in *Reservoir Dogs* are nothing short of exceptional, with a cast that includes Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi delivering portrayals that haunt and captivate. Their dynamic interplay invites the audience to question not only the characters' motives but also the nature of trust and survival when loyalty is put to the ultimate test.The film is a masterclass in minimalism. Tarantino's decision to focus on dialogue-driven scenes, rather than extravagant action sequences, magnifies the impact of each revelation and twist. The sparse settings emphasize the claustrophobia felt by the characters, further immersing the audience into this crime-laden tale. Coupled with an eclectic soundtrack that enhances the film's mood, *Reservoir Dogs* becomes an audio-visual symphony of tension and anticipation.In retrospect, its influence on the crime genre and independent cinema cannot be overstated. *Reservoir Dogs* redefined narrative structure and character development, paving the way for future filmmakers to explore the gray areas of morality and characterization with the same audacity.*Reservoir Dogs* isn't just a film about a heist, it's a profound commentary on human nature, underscored by Tarantino's signature style. It invites viewers into a world where the lines between good and evil blur, leaving them pondering the truths of loyalty and deception long after the credits roll. A true masterpiece that continues to resonate, challenging and thrilling audiences anew with each viewing."
NewandykeFreddie,"Feb 4, 2017",10/10,"This is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It has the perfect amount of mystery, suspense, comedy, action and witty dialogue. It also is not too short and not too long, in that it does not drag on with useless scenes. I feel that every bit of screen time is utilized to the max.Six men who know nothing about each other, and only identify each other by their assigned colours, plan to steal a shipment of diamonds from a diamond wholesaler's. The heist itself is not shown and we can only piece together what might have happened from the stories the men relay afterwards. This causes a bit of a Rashomon effect, in that we don't really know %100 what may have happened. It becomes increasingly apparent that there is an undercover cop lurking among the misters and they must find out who it is before it's too late. The resulting consequences will go down in cinematic history.I have seen this movie at least 10-15 times just in the past year. I definitely would recommend this movie to absolutely anybody. You don't necessarily have to be a movie lover to enjoy this movie. Just sit back, relax and allow Quentin Tarantino to take you away to his cinematic universe."
TheLittleSongbird,"Dec 9, 2010",10/10,"Definitely up there with Pulp Fiction as Tarantino's best. Reservoir Dogs is simply brilliant in all aspects. It is very brash, abrasive and unrelenting, but works tremendously with that sort of tone. The cinematography is very good I think, and the soundtrack is very appropriate and fitting. The story is wonderfully compelling, while the dialogue is very hard-boiled and attitude-laced with plenty of pop culture references, and references to TV shows and hip movies. Tarantino's direction is excellent, and so is the acting. Both Harvey Keitel and Tim Roth give performances that are among their best, while Michael Madson and Steve Buschemi are outstanding. Overall, I think it is a must. Maybe not for all, but I loved it and consider it one of Tarantino's best. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
TheMovieDiorama,"Feb 27, 2018",8/10,"In terms of directorial debuts, this is a solid entry that assured Tarantino as one of the best directors working today. Now, as most of you know, I'm not a big fan of Tarantino. Just not my cup of tea so to speak. Yet this was a good crime thriller. After a heist goes terribly wrong, the group of professional robbers make haste and convene at a remote warehouse. During this time, they try to find out who snitched on them to the police. In glorious (see what I did there...) Tarantino fashion, there is a bucket full of blood and a script full of profanity that infuses rather well with the story. Fortunately the narrative is not linear, so we're flipping back and forth between character introductions and the aftermath of the heist, to keep the plot's pace rapid and fresh. The characters themselves may not be completely memorable, but their names are. Mr White, Mr Brown, Mr Blonde, Mr Orange, Mr Pink and so on. With one humorous scene involving a small argument about the particular choice of ""Mr Pink"" (who was played excellently by Steve Buscemi). It's a story that is dialogue driven, like most of his films, so the wit and dark humour is conveyed through sharp exaggerative banter between these characters. It works, stupendously well actually. Harvey Keitel was the most enjoyable to watch, and finally we have a film with Tim Roth that I actually like. Hooray! Quentin himself should not act in his films. Why? Because he is abysmal. Makes me cringe every time I see him. The torture scene is filled with gore and is probably the most engaging scene in the film. Don't get me wrong, it's a compelling script. But I find the execution extremely, how to put this, noisy. I like subtlety. Sometimes less is more which is why I'm not his biggest fan. Atleast it's not 3 hours long, my brain would've been numbed if that were the case. However in saying that, I find this to be one of his better films (behind Pulp Fiction and Django Unchained) with a punchy script filled with plenty of violence. A damn good directorial debut."
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Sep 13, 2006",8/10,"""I feel like a director who has not yet directed, therefore I don't exist."" Said an idealist, enthusiastic Quentin Tarantino back when he was working at Video Archives in the early 1990s, eager to start climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. At this time he was just a screenplay-writer, penning early works such as Natural Born Killers (a baby of his he felt he stabbed in the heart when he gave up to Oliver Stone to rewrite), True Romance and From Dusk Till Dawnall initially fruitless fares that no one dared to green-light. Production companies were choosy, cliquish and wouldn't give an untested director like Tarantino a break. Not even for Reservoir Dogs.Growing increasingly frustrated at navigating the world of hard-to-please production corporations to OK his project and pass him the director's chair, Taratino approached producer Lawrence Benderarguably the best choice of his career (he's been working closely with him ever since). Bender loved the script of Reservoir Dogsand who wouldn't? It pours crime, gangsters and humour into an exquisite blender and sprinkles it with heavy doses of edgy style. Together the two of them set out to do this film, and soon caught the eye of Richard Gladstein at Live Entertainment in Van Nuys, who would later agree to finance the little project.It really was a ""little"" project, too, with a budget of a mere $1,200,000which meant that the '65 Yellow Cadillac that you see in the film is Michael Madsen's own. Yet breathless and excited at becoming a debut-director and finally getting to tend to his baby himself which this position now afforded him, Quentin Tarantino and Lawrence Bender began the process and the mega cult hit that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" (1992). Harvey Keitel was first approached to star as Mr. White and with his name on-board, he himself convinced several star-actors to grace the cast list along with him. He told them they wouldn't get much money for it, but that the script alone was worth jumping on-board for. They agreed.That's some basic back-story for you on how this film came to be, and I feel it is important to keep in mind the fervent enthusiasm and gratitude with which Quentin Tarantino embarked on his debut-director journey. It translates in the eager, rapid-fire dialogue between the characters, the clever pacing of the story and the fresh edge of the narrative. This is a man with a deeply-rooted love for films and who wanted nothing more than to make his own--and now that privilege had been granted, and not a minute too soon. Upon the release of ""Dogs"", Tarantino was rightly vaulted into the great directors' fame and, I imagine, became even more enthusiastic about film-making.The end product is a very good film that sees five anonymous hit men team up for a big heist  an armed robbery on a Diamond warehouse that will be central to the wide variety of eccentrically quirky characters who all lend their skills to the job. The heat of the police clings onto them during this task because there's talk of a rat in their group... but who is it? The film starts at the end of the robbery, zooming in on a chaotic bloody state and then backtracks in flashbacksnon-chronologically and a bit babbling, but it still worksin an attempt to answer this question. Does it? Yes, but perhaps not in the way you think.Although this fare is devoid of any profound message, morals or statement and there's no discernible kind of symbolism, it is extremely enjoyable on a basic level. In fact, maybe its straightforward approach to a storybut with criminal diversions, twists and plot-devicesis what makes it so great. This is a clever heist, just take it or leave it. The interactions and actions between the characters are at focus, placing environment in the backseat; this means that Reservoir Dogs can proudly boast of having one of the greatest dialogue-driven scenes in film, and it takes place at the beginning at the diner when Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) explains to the other guys why he does not tip waitresses--the others are compassionate and argue that they are minimum-wage workers no rely on tip, but Mr. Pink is stern: ""Do you know what this is? Its the world's smallest violin playing just for the waitresses. ""The film is full of gems like these, full of great colourful gangster performances (in particular Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde--the most badass character in history) and full of clear-eyed and gory style. As far as heist films go, this is a grand accomplishment. If anything, it is a bit short (99 minutes). These characters are so interesting that we never feel as though we get to know them enough--it's a little rushed and a little dizzying at times. This is no surprise as Reservoir Dogs was originally written as a short film, barely stretching 20 minutes and with characters that weren't meant to be particularly developed or dimensional. They are more so in the final, long version, but it's still a little too rushed. Although I suppose is intentional on Tarantino's part to signify the hectic pace of the heist and the cops chasing them.Tarantino sported a modest wallet and a modest ego that had not yet swelled to a ""Cro-Magnon forehead""--as ex-friend and Natural Born Killers producer Don Murphy would describe it--when he wrote and directed this film. Indeed, this aspiring filmmaker loved films so much that he would make a lot of enemies and lose a lot of friends during the course of climbing the directorial ladder in Hollywood. No friends were harmed in the making of this film.8/10"
hishlea-ludea,"Aug 5, 2017",6/10,"From the opening moments of ""Reservoir Dogs"" you sense that you are watching a different kind of crime drama. The style and dialog of this picture bestows a level of intelligence upon it's characters that defies the reality of their chosen profession. Having said that,this movie is absolutely riveting in it's movements from the ordinary, to the grim, to the horrific aspects of a career criminal. Quintin Tarantino has written a tale of an almost corporate order to constructing a crime gang. The delight is in meeting these characters one by one. The particular crime is no more crucial to the film than a 7-11 stick-up. The crux of the movie is the portrayal of the rainbow of characters who find themselves involved in a life of crime. Much has been made of the violence in the movie, but it only serves to point out that all men are different......even the crooked. The director has included a number of very memorable scenes. This is not a linear film. The movie works more as a series of set pieces that weave together a story that is not as important as the individual parts that you have the pleasure of observing. This movie may take more than one viewing to truly appreciate."
daveisit,"Nov 11, 2000",10/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" has great casting, an amazing script, awesome characters and a classic sound track. Perhaps Mr. Pink should move to Australia, a society that tips only when someone deserves it and not because they are doing their job.It is very rare that I give a movie a 10 out of 10, but this movie is just gold."
ian_harris,"Jul 2, 2003",6/10,"I know that this film is highly regarded and that my adverse view is a minority one, but I found Reservoir Dogs unsubtle and uninteresting.I don't really like violent movies, but I liked Pulp Fiction, which I found clever and compelling.  Reservoir Dogs shows some signs of similar flair, but only the odd flicker of it.The strong language I was promised was not particularly ripe - I learned no new ways of saying ""f*** you"" having experienced the entire canon in Glengarry Glen Ross.  Indeed, Mamet does foul language better.  The introduction of the prefix ""mother"" in Pulp Fiction took the language genre much further.  Mostly this film is distinguished only by the gratuitousness of its violence, which is disturbing at times, especially Mr Blonde's frenzy.What little plot there is (and boy, is there little) didn't quite stack up for me, nor did it bring out any real complexity in the characters.I enjoyed the opening scene in the diner, haggling over the morality of tipping, but it was downhill from there for me.Good performances by Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel in particular."
Mr_Vai,"Aug 30, 2004",1/10,"I remember watching this movie when it first came out and I did not know what to think. I mean, it was different. I could not remember seeing dialog like this before or a scene where a guy cuts another guy's ear off. It was unique in that regard. Mind you, it was different, but not really special. Moreover, some parts were very boring. Other parts were so ""talky"" and somewhat over the top, that they strained credibility. However, there were some funny lines as well. After having watched this again, some ten years later, I can say with all honesty, this film has not aged well. On second look, you see what looks like a first year film student project. It still has funny lines, but the story is paper thin. The actors tend to over act and the dialog is so full of Clint Eastwood wannabe one-liners, that you just roll your eyes. Michael Madsen cannot act, sorry. He is cool, but he cannot act. Tim Roth's attempt at an American accent makes him sound like Ralph Cramden from the HoneyMooners. I was just amazed at how bad this film really looked to a more mature person. The funny lines just don't cover that constant posturing of characters that have no real depth. The movie is cotton candy, it looks filling, but is far from it. Perhaps there will always be 14 year old boys around to give this ""cool film"" high marks, but I fear it will grow more ridiculous the older I get. However, Tarantino has this cult of personality going and I am sure the 10s will continue coming in for this film and a 10 might mean perfect in here, but that don't make it so."
chaos-rampant,"Mar 25, 2016",N/A,"A great creative insight is to take things that we think of as separate and contained (like 'art', 'genius', or 'ideas') and realize how they are fluid and inter-dependent, conditioned by factors. This is not to expose anything as little, deconstruction for its sake; it's to show them to be doable, that a road leads up to them. (It's also one of the three main areas of Buddhist practice)One obvious way to do this would be to take this and note the many influences. This has been done to death already, every bit that Tarantino hoped to keep packed or wanted us to find out has been laid out in the open. But this just gives us someone, genius or not, who stole from the right places.Another way would be to see that it doesn't work the same way as it did when new because it has all been made ordinary by slavish followers, gobbled up by familiarity. The moments of simple banter away from plot, the fooling round with edges of story without showing the main center-piece, bleeding on a floor, following Mr. Blonde outside to pick up a can of gasoline; Tarantino was probably proud that he was being ""real"", making a radical break from Bruckheimer's Hollywood.It's bits and pieces of Godard, Cassavetes, Altman, and others. To see it now shows how theatric it is, not ""real"" at all. (The least theatric acting is by the bound cop. Roth is just woeful.) It's The Killers, with the violence and gum pop visuals as typical to see as The Killers was typical without them in its own time.Me, I'd like to settle for something else that brings us to real influence of a more elusive kind.Everything you see here is coming from a young guy who was at the best possible time in his life, lifted from obscurity and everything was beginning to click into place beyond expectation. Can you imagine how giddy he must have been to hear yes from Keitel and here's a check?It's Tarantino coming in from the outside as someone young and eager to make a dream come true; it's bursting with energy but disciplined, kept in check by not having everything at your disposal, being the new kid on set. It would be nothing without this energy.And it's Tarantino being rooted in his own world as he brings the dream alive, suburban LA. None of the story has any outlet into real lives, it's all bounced around movie cutouts. Gangsters showing up before a heist for breakfast in tuxedos? But it's the video clerk's imagination cruising through his own world. He has guys exchange banter about a stripper from Palos Verdes, Roth improvise a story about buying weed the summer of '86.So this is the most vibrant sense I get; someone making it, not having to prove himself because he's there, making a movie with name actors around town, relaxed and fired up at the same time. See if you can feel this off his screen presence (and what a stark difference from his surly presence now).His next one would be the apogee of this path. It can also be traced to the 30 year old who had flown himself to Amsterdam to write away from home like a Hemingway, living the dream."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 28, 2010",9/10,"I've been trying to see a lot of seminal films when possible. This is one that had me turning my head from time to time because of all the gore and disregard for human life. It starts with this great restaurant scene, Diner on steroids, where Steve Buscemi proves to be the selfish, cheap SOB that he plays throughout the film. I could watch this guy and his neurotic tics forever. I love films that put us at a point in time and then reconstruct the events leading up to it. Add to this, career criminals, some of whom are totally lacking in conscience. We have Harvey Keitel who is one of our greatest actors playing character with a little moral sense. He wants to find a little good. The characters all go by colors so they won't be able to identify each other if they are captured. Again, Buscemi gets into one of his gratuitous discussions when it is decided that he will be Mr. Pink. There is so much violence here, but the movie is at times funny and outrageous in a really insane way. Each guy is a powder keg and they maneuver for position. And, of course, there is ""the scene."" I really like the taut nature of this film, a mere 100 minutes. It moves neatly to its conclusion (well, perhaps, ""neatly"" isn't the best word), and things are tied up well in the end. Despite the huge amount of violence, I can see why people gravitate toward this film."
mbhgkmsgg,"Nov 13, 2020",8/10,"As Tarantino as it gets. Reservoir Dogs is exactly what you'd expect from him. It's funny, it's gory, it's brutal and above all else, it's absolutely ridiculous. This movie could've been so incredible, but unfortunately, it slightly misses the mark.What I loved about this movie is, no doubt, what everyone else loved as well. Those scenes in the warehouse are spectacular. The fact that you can make conversations between people so intense and thrilling is remarkable. And this movie nails that. Every scene in the warehouse is perfect. You never know what is going to happen and you are constantly on the edge of your seat. Had this movie been entirely in the warehouse, I'm sure I would've liked it way more.As is though, the movie doesn't do that. It almost feels like Tarantino knew how intense those warehouse scenes were and decided that the viewer needed a break. As such, the film goes on to give introductions to some of the characters. These introductions, however, felt completely unnecessary to me. Not only did they break the pace and intensity of the film, but they also broke the mystery and intrigue of the characters. I would've been perfectly fine with never knowing anything but the made-up names that each character had. Especially the introduction of Mr. Orange felt unnecessarily long and added very little to the overall story.This movie could've been near perfect had it kept true to its intensity and the thrill of the post heist moments. Using that confined location and nothing else and pitting these characters against each other in an endless barrage of doubt and accusation would've truly been a sight to behold. I wanted to be on the edge of my seat the whole time, especially considering the relatively short runtime. Alas, I was forced to take breaks and breathe for a moment just be brought back into the excellence of the warehouse.With all that being said, it's still a great movie. It has all the characteristics you'd want from a Tarantino film and it is immensely entertaining even in the slower moments. It probably isn't a classic yet, but it undoubtedly will be one in the future. As far as I'm concerned, it wasn't as good as it could've been, but that's just my opinion. And based on most reviews that I've read many consider it to be as good as it could've ever been."
ThomasGlebe,"Nov 9, 2025",8/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" from 1992, written and directed by Quentin Tarantino in his first screenplay and feature directing effort, is a taut, electrifying crime thriller that redefined independent filmmaking. The story follows a crew of color-coded criminals whose supposedly foolproof diamond heist collapses into a bloody, tension-charged nightmare of suspicion and betrayal. The crew includes the pragmatic Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and the nervous, resourceful Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), the sadistic and unpredictable Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), and the cautious and meticulous Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). Tarantino also appears as the enigmatic Mr. Brown, a habit he would duplicate in many of his future films, and proves to be a pretty decent actor. Lawrence Tierney dominates as the grizzled mob boss Joe Cabot, Chris Penn as his volatile son Nice Guy Eddie, and Edward Bunker brings raw authenticity from his real-life criminal past. Filmed almost entirely inside a Los Angeles warehouse on a shoestring $1.2 million budget, cinematographer Andrzej Sekula crafts a gritty, sun-bleached look that contrasts sharply with Tarantino's razor-sharp dialogue and bursts of stylized violence. The retro soundtrack, anchored by hits like ""Little Green Bag"" by George Baker Selection and ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" by Stealers Wheel, injects darkly comic irony, amplifying the carnage and establishing Tarantino's now-iconic pairing of pop music with brutality. Notably, Tarantino initially planned to play Mr. Pink, but Harvey Keitel's involvement lent credibility to the project and helped attract the investors who provided the actual funding. Compared with later works such as Pulp Fiction and Inglourious Basterds, the film feels leaner, tighter, and more claustrophobic because of its single heist focus and confined warehouse setting. But its energy, wit, and audacity hit like a gunshot or the sting of a cut-off ear. The mostly linear structure and minimal time shifts actually make it sharper, more immediate, and intensely focused, showcasing Tarantino's emerging mastery of tension, dialogue, and cinematic style. Tarantino's style and the brutal violence may not be for everyone, yet this is a genuinely thrilling debut for a rising young talent in Hollywood, easily launching his career into the stratosphere. Effective, intriguing, and compelling from start to finish."
richardchatten,"Aug 12, 2025",10/10,"'Reservoir Dogs' reverses the plot of 'The Taking of Pelham One, Two Three' - which had depicted a hold-up that evidently was the result of meticulous planning - so that Tarantino instead concentrates upon on the planning and aftermath.So just as the funniest scene in 'Who Dares Wins' occurred offscreen depicting Ingrid Pitt's mounting impatience as she supervised her colleagues clumsy attempts to do up their bow ties in order to disguise themselves as a military band; so Tarantino treats us to the sight of bunch of grown men squabbling over the assignment of their colours."
FiftyTwo_52,"Aug 29, 2025",8/10,"Thirty years later, Tarantino's explosive debut remains a masterpiece of tension and character. Reservoir Dogs proves that innovative storytelling trumps budget every time... this $1.2 million thriller delivers more suspense than most blockbusters. The wow factor? Tarantino's breakthrough feature film was shot in just 30 days!The genius lies in what we don't see. The heist itself happens off-screen; instead, we're trapped in that warehouse with increasingly paranoid criminals, watching trust disintegrate in real-time. Tarantino's non-linear structure isn't gimmicky... it's essential, revealing character motivations precisely when maximum impact is achieved.Harvey Keitel anchors the ensemble with weathered professionalism, while Tim Roth's dual performance as cop-playing-criminal creates heartbreaking dramatic irony. Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde remains one of cinema's most terrifying villains: calm, unpredictable, genuinely dangerous. Steve Buscemi's Mr. Pink provides paranoid comic relief that never undermines the stakes.The dialogue crackles with Tarantino's signature blend of pop culture philosophy and criminal pragmatism. Every conversation reveals character while building unbearable tension toward the inevitable explosion.8.5/10 - Reservoir Dogs launched independent cinema's golden age and remains influential because it respects audience intelligence. No exposition dumps, no hand-holding... just pure cinematic storytelling that rewards attention and multiple viewings."
mallory217,"Mar 15, 2023",6/10,"I was not satisfied with Quentin Tarantino's ""Reservoir Dogs"". The movie starts off with some lighthearted comedy and then transitions into more serious events. It is a good way to engage and hook the audiences, but unfortunately, this hook only lasts so long. The twist is easy to predict, and the movie is extremely dull. I felt none of the characters were extremely fleshed out, so there is not really any reason to attach to any of them. The ending was decent, but left me feeling a little disappointed. With already mostly unlikeable and boring characters being the center of the movie, an ending like this doesn't work. If you take away the one or two likeable characters it really disconnects the audience. Overall not my favorite Tarantino movie."
gabriel_sanchez,"Jun 10, 2018",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs (1992) is a slow paced story-driven flick about a heist gone wrong.It's a Tarantino's movie, so go on for it knowing that: plot is not linear, there's a lot of swearing, acting is great, story is awesome. Enough said!"
dr_foreman,"Mar 16, 2004",2/10,"People sure love this movie.  I have a friend who says that it's good because of the ear-slicing scene; most directors would cut away from such violence entirely, but here, we get to see the aftermath of a maiming.  Well yeah, ""Reservoir Dogs"" does push the envelope - but towards what?  Should we really praise a movie just because it wallows in violence more willingly than its predecessors?My ex-girlfriend says this is a Greek tragedy.  If that were true, the violence would be entirely justified, because it would help elevate ""Reservior Dogs"" to the level of an enlightening commentary on human nature. Alas, none of the characters is particularly noble; they start off as low-lifes and have nowhere to fall.  So, that defense doesn't seem to work either.In short, people have long tried to convince me that this is really a masterpiece.  But even the best parts - such as the opening dialogue in the restaurant - seem artificial and engineered.  Tarantino is ripping off older, better films and directors wholesale.  There are shades of ""The Taking of Pelham 123"" here, and there's also a dash of ""The Omen"" at the end.  Hitchcock, Frankenheimer, and even John Carpenter did this kind of stuff before, and they did it better.  No doubt Tarantino was a breath of fresh air after the shallow era of 1980s action movies, but he was not much of an innovator, and I don't think that his super-cool style has stood even the shortest test of time; he has, after all, practically dropped off the face of the earth."
kurciasbezdalas,"Oct 10, 2008",10/10,"What is good about this movie? Probably the same things what makes other Tarantino's movies good: great soundtrack, good actors, stylish direction and of course - violence (actauly there was only one scene which I would call really violent). The plot is pretty simple but it's portrayed out of chronological order (just like in Pulp Fiction). Probably that is what makes this movie different. Also everything in a movie looked pretty realistic (like violence) and all characters acted very natural (there were many memorable dialogs, so you could know each character better). This movie is very original, stylish and worth your time."
rgpaeplrp,"Jul 24, 2025",10/10,"So, I watched Reservoir Dogs, and wow - what a ride. This is Quentin Tarantino's first big film, and it feels like a game-changer. It's super raw and intense, but what surprised me is that it's not about the actual heist - it's about what happens after everything goes wrong. Most of the movie takes place in this grimy warehouse, and the whole time you're just watching these guys lose trust in each other. The cast is incredible. Harvey Keitel kills it as Mr. White, Tim Roth is amazing (and heartbreaking), and then there's Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde - that guy is terrifying in the best way possible. And Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink? Pure gold. What stands out, though, is the dialogue. It's so sharp and full of personality. Tarantino has this way of making people argue about random stuff, and it somehow feels more intense than the gunfights. The soundtrack is perfect too - it's cheerful in some dark scenes, which makes them even more disturbing. Reservoir Dogs is brutal and stylish. Not for everyone - it's violent and full of cursing - but if you like smart crime stories with amazing characters, this is a must-watch. My rating- 10/10. Absolute classic."
Boba_Fett1138,"Aug 26, 2003",10/10,"By owning this movie you own a little piece of movie history.The absolute most fantastic thing about ""Reservoir Dogs"" is the brilliant dialog. The movie is one big memorable quote and it alone makes the movie more then worth to watch.Another wonderful thing about the movie are the characters. Rarely has there ever been so many great, cool and memorable characters in one movie. Maybe it's because of the amazing cast, everyone is perfect in their role I'm not going to especially mention a few because I feel I then won't do enough credit to the others and credit they deserve!The story is told in an unique way by using flashbacks from how they all got the assignment for the mission and flashbacks from after the robbery, not shown in the right order. And it works wonderful! It's a shear pleasure to watch from beginning till end.The hand held camera work gives the movie an extra cool feeling, it might look a bit unprofessional but it's nothing more then a brilliant addition to an already brilliant movie. The nice and cool ""Super sounds of the 70's"" soundtrack also adds to this, especially the now world famous thanks to the movie ""Little Green Bag"" from the George Baker Selection.The movie is full with memorable moments such as the fantastic opening, the cop torture sequence and the Mexican stand-off at the end. But between all those scene's there are lot's of other moments which you will never forget.Brilliant movie. An absolute must see!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
badmOP,"Mar 8, 1999",10/10,"Simply put, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the greatest movies ever made. This 1992 predecessor to 1994's ""Pulp Fiction"" is truly in a class by itself.  This film has been a blueprint for basically every other wanna-be-like-Tarantino movie made in the last seven or so odd years.  The acting is truly superb.  Every one of the main characters turn in top-notch performances.  Harvey Keitel's turn as the o'er-the-hill criminal MR WHITE is perhaps his best ever.  Micheal Madsen's take as the psychopathic MR BLONDE is perhaps one of the most realistically frightening performances I've ever seen.  This was truly the role he was born to play.Rounding out the cast, you have the always enjoyable Steve Buscemi (MR PINK), Tarantino favorite Tim Roth (MR ORANGE), Tarantino favorite Quentin Tarantino (MR BROWN), Chris Penn as NICE GUY EDDIE and finally.....(whew)....Lawrence Tierney as the cranky mob boss JOE CABOT. The cast is utterly superb.One aspect of Tarantino's is his ability to say so much with so little.  Though the scene involving MR BLONDE'S shooting spree is never actually seen in the film, it is all too easy to picture Micheal Madsen in his JoeKool shtick, blasting holes into anything moving with eerie unemotional detachment.   Tarantino BUILDS his characters with amazing style. (see Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown, etc...)  MR WHITE'S compassionate struggle to protect and save the life of MR ORANGE is gutwrenchingly moving. True ""honor among thieves"" type stuff here.All in all, this movie is a classic.  Be cool.....man."
Xarx117,"Apr 22, 2022",10/10,"This movie is awsome! The dialog is perfect from start to finish. The opening scene is one of my favourite opening scene in movies. Just that first scene is a masterpiece of character developement and world building. Quentin Tarantino's humor in this movie is insanely good. The movie is extremly investing for many reasons. And the secrets of the plot are slowly told but once they are revealed its still has interresting. Each character have some very special aspects about them, and its probably the movie with the most different interresting characters. The ending is truly one of my favourite, and its very special because there is just a few writer that dare end their movie this way. The chronologic order is awsome also. This is also one of the best movie soundtrack ever. The movie has everything a perfect movie can have. Its an awsome dialog masterpiece!"

dave_wlogan,"Jul 21, 2008",10/10,"Tarantino's first film is perhaps the best. The dialogue is just people talking about normal stuff like music, TV, movies and random stories. The action has a realistic brutality to it which causes audiences to cringe and it has the best soundtrack a film has ever had. The cast is the stuff of indie film legend. Keitel, Madsen, Buscemi and Roth. Madsen shines above all these others due to his performance and the actions of his character. This film has been called overly violent but I didn't find it shocking to watch, entertaining but I grew up on Braveheart, Terminator and Pulp Fiction, three films I saw before I saw 'Reservoir Dogs'. This film is truly great, an instant classic and a must see film."
walion,"Apr 12, 2016",7/10,"I clicked the play button with huge expectations for this movie, alas 'Reservoir Dogs' did not show any evidence of being a classic one admired by most of the critics. The much-loved Quentin Tarantino impressed with his first work, which definitely shouldn't be considered as one of the best crime thrillers of all time. It would be a big mistake to think of it as one.'Reservoir Dogs' follows the story of a newly formed crew that has the simple, yet dangerous job, which eventually would go terribly wrong - a diamond robbery. The intriguing thing is that the 6 members (1 of them is an undercover cop) of the crew do not know anything about each other, and are given new names by the guy who hired them - Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney). The movie starts with a conversation between the members of the crew that of course has nothing to do with the film plot itself, reminiscent of a conversation between Samuel L. Jackson and John Travolta in 'Pulp Fiction'. During the robbery (which is just described), when the alarm goes off, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) starts shooting at everyone like a psycho. That's the moment when the police officers arrive and things go nasty very quickly. The criminals should gather in a barn after the jewelry heist. Unfortunately there's only 5 left of them, the other 2 are shot dead.The best thing of this movie was definitely the acting of Steve Buscemi. In the role of Mr. Pink. Steve shows that he has the ability to give the needed color to a movie with his unique acting."
Egg_MacGuffin,"Jun 17, 2005",1/10,"To quote the great Terry Rossio:""There are many films with the goal 'to find your way home.' But there's only one film where a girl clicks together a pair of ruby slippers.""What that basically means is that the goal of many stories is essentially the same. The 'find your way home' example is used in films such as E.T., The Wizard of Oz, and Back To The Future, just to name a few. Only one of those has ruby slippers. Only one has a bicycle fly past the moon. Only one has a time-traveling Delorean.The goal of 'criminals getting together to pull off the perfect heist' has been used is such films as The Killing, The Taking of Pelham One Two Three, and City on Fire...just to name a few. Only one had an un-chronological order to the events. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had the criminals use color-coded names to keep their identities anonymous. Until Reservoir Dogs. Only one had an undercover cop infiltrate a gang of crooks and befriend another crook, only to get shot during the process of the robbery, until he confesses the truth to his new friend. Until Reservoir Dogs.If you cannot see that this entire film is just a cut and paste job, then you have to be mentally impaired. And that is not an insult.As far as originality goes, Tarantino hasn't got to that point yet. The point where he creates something on his own. This is just a second hand, second rate cut and paste job that is only mildly entertaining on first viewing. Upon seeing the film subsequent times, it only gets worse, and it's (very many) flaws only stand out to an even more obvious extent. This is a bad movie even for someone who has never directed anything before in his life.The film starts with a discussion that might as well be about Jesus, pancake syrup, or the duties of the school crossing guard. None of these have anything to do with the story...much like the conversation we see before the opening credits roll. Which brings me to another discussion that takes place later on in the film...something about Lady E and a superglue incident. How is this any of our business? How does it advance the story? What do we get out of it besides a possible forced laugh of pity? It's not our business, it does not advance the story, and we get nothing out of that scene at all. You can literally remove it and be left with the same exact film, just without that scene. From the point before that scene started to after it finished, NOTHING HAS CHANGED AT ALL. It's complete filler. A total waste of time.This movie would have been pretty good without extraneous scenes floating around, popping up at random, and taking entirely too long to finish. The best example of this is the whole Tim Roth segment. It interrupts the flow of the story and it simply not fun to watch. It's a huge dead moment right before the climax of the movie and it's very easy to simply lose interest at that point. When the finale does come, it's more of a ""good, it's over"" point rather than any kind of realization. Tarantino couldn't even create a good third act when he literally just copied the third act from City on Fire, and in some cases...shot for shot!Resertvoir Dogs showed us nothing that we have not seen before...literally. The only positive thing about it is the cast, and that's even not so great. Most of the dialogue is just screaming and f-words being used like it's going out of style (and it has, thanks to films like this), and the ""infamous"" and ""extreme"" violence is about on par with The Lion King. So if you're thinking about watching this movie...just watch a good heist movie instead. I suggest:The Killing The Asphalt Jungle The Taking of Pelham One Two Three"
AKS-6,"Dec 11, 2000",8/10,"Reservoir Dogs is easily the best film Quentin Tarantino has directed. Much better than Pulp Fiction and Jackie Brown. RD is funny, entertaining, intelligent and actually not so violent as some people say. Sure, lots of blood, but not so much violence, according to me.The acting... Steve Buscemi has never been better, Harvey Keitel is great, but the stand-out in this great cast is Tim Roth. He's brilliant. Great flick. (8/10)"
Quinoa1984,"Jul 23, 2003",10/10,"Whenever the name Quentin Tarantino is mentioned nowadays, people treat him with the same reverence as Scorsese, De Palma, and other directors as such who have fiddled around with the crime/gangster genre to create personal, heavy-duty masterworks.  However, at the time this film was first released, as was with his still best picture 'Pulp', he was regarded as a filmmaker who makes violent movies, filled with violence, chock full of violence, ""too violent"" (if there ever could or should be such a thing in movies), etc. This is unfair.  True, Tarantino writes and works his actors to such an intensity that the feelings that go with violent acts and violent tension is there, and true he shows the blood, he lets us hear the cries of agony and despair, and indeed there are times that bullets fired into people are shown as such right in frame.Yet he never exactly displays any truly violent acts (he decided to leave the shot of Masden slicing the ear on the editing floor, unlike a director like David Lynch who gets right inside the matter) - his technique is to evoke and strive for all of the emotions one would feel in such asituation, movie or in real life, to the most honest, near heart-wrenching limits, and thus to someone who may have even not even seen the film the images that appear in a trailer or on a video box bring the notion of this being an overly violent movie immediately.  That the images we see throughout the film, bloody or not, stay with us long after the credits roll, is a testament to his dedication, and obvious trust, to his craft being as it is.The plot, while lifted from a Chow-Yun Fat film from the mid-eighties, is the first one to include his trademark non-linear storytelling design. Sure, this is not uncommon in most films, but since each scene has a meaty quality to it, with line after line of (purposeful, to story as well as character) dialog is spoken, you really don't know what to expect.  A crime boss (Lawrence Tierny) assembles different criminals of different backgrounds, removes them of their given Christian names, and gives them pseudonym colors as the heist comes up.  The robbery itself has a big hitch- cops are alerted sooner than thought, shoot-outs occur, some colors are wiped away, and the remaining assemble in the rendezvous to sort out what went wrong and who's to blame.For most films with such an ambitious and grounded script, nearly every performance is a crucial asset to the film's success, and Tarantino knows this in his bones, as well as in the casting of the right parts (i.e. Steve Buscemi auditioned for Mr. White but got Mr. Pink, makes sense doesn't it): Keitel and Tierny are like old pros merely portraying old pros; Roth has a true breakout performance as Orange; Busemi himself proves why he's needed in film today; Chris Penn makes for a fine supporting role; Masden is one of the most convincing of the 90's psychos; even Tarantino makes a perfect monologue for himself in the opener.  Right away these actors give off the only impression they should - these are people that we can care about, despise, or watch in a lack of judgment as they float away in a flash - they've got to be human all the way.So, is Reservoir Dogs for everyone?  Not necessarily- children under the age of nine or ten, I'd suggest, should stay away even if they can understand and take the violence since it's really an film for maturer mindsets.  But, for the passionate movie-goer, or for thrill seeking screen nuts, it's worth the ride.  For one thing, I'll never think of ""Stuck in the Middle With You"", or Steven Wright for that matter, the same way again.  My opinion- Tarantino's 3rd best effort behind Pulp Fiction and From Dusk Till Dawn, and nearly superior over Jackie Brown.  A+"
ciuca,"May 8, 2006",8/10,"Reservoir Dogs is a crime thriller starring Oscar nominee Harvey Keitel (who also starred in Taxi Driver) and Tim Roth (from Rosencratz & Guildenstern Are Dead). It is directed by Quentin Tarantino, directing his first feature-length film. I've got to confess that I was disappointed. I thought it was going to be fun, creative, wonderfully weird, etc. The whole thing didn't really seem to have a point. And the fun dialogue got old after a couple minutes into it. And it just kept building up and I thought it was going to lead up to an amazing climax, but it didn't. The whole film leads up to nothing. Thus it being pointless.One thing I have to give the film is it is creatively directed by Tarantino. The use of music during the torture scene really lightens the mood, even though someone gets his ear cut off. It just would've been stupid without the music. And the opening scene where all the guys are at a restaurant talking about normal things is amusing and one of the best opening scenes in a movie ever.But it all goes downhill from there. Like I said before, Tarantino makes you think like this is going to be a great film but it ends up disappointing. I really wanted to love this movie because of its creativity but the script completely ruined it for me.I don't recommend this movie but I do recommend Tarantino's next film, Pulp Fiction. All of the positive aspects of this film that I mentioned above are in Pulp Fiction but ten times better. Plus, Pulp Fiction has a good story and actually leads up to something. So I suggest for you to skip this film and watch Pulp Fiction instead."
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Jun 5, 2005",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Unmissable **** Very Good *** Okay ** You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead * Avoid At All CostsA film telling the tale of the after-math of a botched bank raid by a gang of professional thieves. The rapid alert of the police and word-of-mouth has also drawn the conclusion of an undercover police officer in their midst.Upon it's initial release, this flick caused the biggest stir in movies since The Exorcist. A generally violent, foul-mouthed movie at the best of times featuring the notorious ear-cutting scene. Although having seen it, I can't really see what all the fuss was about. The camera veers away from that shot, whereas in Robocop you saw a man get blasted to bits by a gang of crooks with guns (as well as seeing him writhing in agony whilst they laugh at and taunt him!) and another scene where you see a man's testicles apparently get blown off after an attempted rape, yet to the best of my knowledge that was never banned, or even Candyman 2 where you actually see a man's hand being severed off with a rusty blade whilst similar taunting is going on which was never banned. I suppose the graphic, real shot of the man who's been shot in the stomach at the beginning might have played a big part too, though (in a way, it's certainly a lot more shocking than that scene.)But all that controversy aside, we are dealing with a truly legendary film here. A small, low-budget, art-house production that leaves you more fulfilled than any big-budget, Hollywood production ever could. There is a genuinely impressive, shining quality to the writing, dialogue and story-telling at play here that no doubt cemented Tarantino's ascension to his current glory. Moreover, you can see what are probably the earliest hatchings of the 'reverse-plotting' trend starting here that lead to such films as Memento getting made.All of the cast are excellent, and it can only be the work of the hands of fate that while some went on to really make names for themselves (Tarantino, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi) others (Michael Madsen, Chris Penn) just got delegated to either supporting roles or straight-to-video roles. I suppose if I had to pick particular favourites, they would be Buscemi as the edgy, mechanical brains of the group, and Madsen, who has a quiet, un-nerving edge to him that seems typical of a genuine psychopath.It is basically a film driven by dialogue and atmosphere, with a cracking soundtrack from artists as diverse as Steeler's Wheel to Dolly Parton. It's controversy may have given it a helping hand and the name 'Reservoir Dogs' is never actually explained, but for far better reasons than that, this is a film that deserves never to be forgotten. *****"

jomayevans,"Jan 10, 2024",7/10,"Went to rewatch this for first time in decades but couldn't get into it however today I did. And it was a entertaining watch still despite its shot nainky in a small space. Madsen is the character you remember the most.. I finally heard Alabama 's named mentioned something I never noticed when first came out but since read Tarantions original script for true romance had Clarence die and Alabama get into the crime life. And although its a interesting prospect to have had more on her. Tony Scott did True Romance * Alabama justice with the right ending a happy 1. Harvey keitel is great in this as the criminal with compassion. The ending though from the rat didn't make sense he would do/say that. That's my only gripe with the story. When it comes to tarantino films they're usually better when directed by some1 else
But this and Jackie Brown. He did well with Jackie still my favourite. Pulp fiction I've never got the love for and find it so forgettable
I can't not look at Mafsen and see elvis lol."
gaus,"Nov 1, 1999",6/10,"A grim action movie with OK actors and OK story, but it's not a masterpiece. Tarrantino seams to add extreme violence and blood in all his movies just to shock the audience around the world. His characters are to one-dimensional to my taste, and I think his style will be exposed as a cheap way to thrill in the future.""From dusk to dawn"" was mush better, see that one in stead."
chiguy17,"Sep 9, 2019",2/10,"After not finding a reason to watch this the past few decades, I decided to watch it since it was on Showtime and there was nothing else to watch. I couldn't believe how disappointed I was.I didn't particularly care for Pulp Fiction, but at least it was original and somewhat creative. There just wasn't anything entertaining about Reservoir Dogs. The only thing I was surprised by was Tarantino's appearance in it (which would have not happened had he not written & directed it - I'm not sure how many people realize he's a failed actor).I'd heard enough about the film that I was prepared for the violence and gore, and while I didn't enjoy that aspect, it wasn't the reason I disliked the film so much. Although some of the language was a bit abrasive (the rampant use of the word in an early 90's film does seem... odd to say the least). It was just plain boring. The plot was thin and barely held together, and the ending was just completely unsatisfying.I just don't see anything about this film that would make any true cinephile consider this a masterpiece. It doesn't lend anything to the cinematic landscape of the genre or decade or film in general. The only people who would like it would have to be Taratino buffs (who are a breed of their own) and love it because it was his first big film - which apparently is a rip-off of an Asian crime film.Honestly, unless you're a hardcore Tarantino fan (in which case you've probably already seen it) skip it! Maybe it was a landmark in sheer amount of violence, but it's certainly not relevant nor does it offer any redeeming value."
jcanettis,"Dec 23, 2004",8/10,"I really find Tarantino totally overrated: He tries to make an impact by overwhelming his audience with unbelievably gory scenes, while his films lack any substantial and interesting element; the ""Kill Bill"" series are a prime example of this lame strategy. However, there is one single exception to the above: ""Reservoir Dogs"".To start with, ""Reservoir Dogs"" still has the necessary Tarantinesque blood galore and shocking scenes, although these are more limited compared to his other films. Moreover, blood is not what makes ""RD"" stand out: Instead, the film has a very distinct style, as it depicts the characters of the movie in a very ordinary, ""next-door-guy"" style, while they commit not-so-ordinary crimes. The dialogs, the setting, the suspense, everything is very simple and yet very different in its way, as the film has a structure which is elementary yet intriguing. The plot is also quite simple (five strangers perform a bank robbery and then try to find a rat among them), yet it achieves to keep our interest in high levels until the very end. The performances are good, with Harvey Kaitel being first among equals.Pity that Tarantino did not make any other movies like this one. 8/10."
RASTA-4,"Aug 10, 1998",10/10,"Ear Chopping, No Tipping, Comode Story telling, Jewellery store escaping, Mexican standoff shooting movie Reservoir Dogs.

You might not like this movie if you have trouble handling violence and vulgarity but if you get passed that this is a masterpiece that should be admired. I hate the Oscars for not nominating this for anything despite it was the IMDb's top movie for 1992.  This is the greatest film ever and everyone should watch it."
motrous,"Apr 16, 2021",9/10,"Tarantino hit the ground running and he's never really slowed down. It definitely feels like ""early Tarantino"" but it's a great movie. The way Madsen plays his character, especially toward the end, is chilling. But the entire cast is stellar. This is one of those movies that is carried by the actors and the dialog."
MrLunatic,"Jul 13, 2018",9/10,"Despite not being a high budget Tarantino film, it is my favorite one. I saw Pulp Fiction indeed, but there are some things:
1) The cinematography in Reservoir Dogs (for me) is slightly better, as it captures every moment perfectly.
2) Characters are more understandable.
3) Movie focuses on same characters who are connected to the same story which makes it easier to follow.I believe all of the actors did a pretty good job. Movie is violent no doubt so be careful if you're new to Tarantino. If you already know him and like his movies you've probably seen this but if you haven't, go see it. Also note that the gunplay is remarkably good.10/10 (Orginally a 9/10 but I had to give an extra point for the rewatchability factor)"
jluis1984,"Sep 8, 2006",9/10,"It seems that it was only yesterday when in 1992 the then unknown director Quentin Tarantino screened his debut film, ""Reservoir Dogs"", at Sundance with great success suddenly becoming the new star of independent cinema and an the most promising director of that ""class of 1992"". Of course, later came ""Pulp Fiction"" and what started as a phenomenon within the indie scene became a worldwide success starting a trend of imitators and making Tarantino a powerful figure in Hollywood. But despite the rights and wrongs of Tarantino's career, the groundbreaking ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a fine example of excellent cinema and a classic of the 90s on its own right.The plot begins with two criminals, codenamed Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arriving to an abandoned mortuary. Orange is badly hurt, and soon we discover that they are members of a group of criminals hired to make a robbery, and that the crime went wrong when the police showed up ending in a shootout where the two of them barely escaped alive. After another survivor, Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), arrives, the group realizes that they were set up by an infiltrated agent, but since only their boss knows the details about them (including the real names), anybody in the room could be the traitor. Finally, the arrival of another member, Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), complicates the plot, as the other three are sure that he is the one who betrayed them.Without a doubt, ""Reservoir Dogs""' greatest strength is in the remarkably well-written script by Tarantino himself. The four main characters are fleshed out in a way that makes them very real, very human; each of them with a distinct series of personal traits that one can't help to feel that you know really them (something ironic, considering they are supposed not to know each other). The whole situation, built as a heist film where the heist is never seen (only told via flashbacks), makes these four personalities collide and actually the relationships between them become the point of the film itself. It's not about the crime itself, but about the criminals who committed it.Tarantino's skill as a director is nowhere near his skill as a writer, but still he creates a very stylish film letting all his influences flourish, particularly the french new wave and classic noir heist films. Although it's safe to say that here they don't become as blatant as in this later ""genre tribute"" movies ""Jackie Brown"" and ""Kill Bill"". With very simple, but effective camera-work and a great use of incidental music as a soundtrack, Tarantino crafts a superb film despite its budgetary limitations shows a very promising talent with huge potential as a filmmaker.The four main characters are wonderfully played by a very effective cast of actors. Harvey Keitel (who also produced the film) shows off his talent as the experienced Mr. White, who becomes some kind of paternal figure to the newbie Mr. Orange, in another of Tim Roth's excellent performances. Steve Buscemi gives his usual high quality work and the cast is completed by a Michael Madsen with tremendous presence and total control of the screen. Supporting characters are played by the very effective Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney. Convict-turned-author Eddie Bunker and Tarantino himself appear in small roles with mixed-up results (Tarantino is not really a good actor).The film is remarkably well-done for its budget, and despite being set almost entirely in a single room, it never feels tiresome or boring. Tarantino's violent crime drama has hold up well and personally, it rivals his follow-up, ""Pulp Fiction"", and at times it surpasses it. Some minor flaws include Tarantino's own lack of acting skills and an use of violence (not graphic, but somehow disturbing) that may be excessive to some people (although it fits perfectly within the movie's theme and atmosphere). Almost a flawless film.Wheter one loves or hates Tarantino becomes meaningless at judging this film, its qualities makes it speak for itself as one of the best movies about crime ever made. It's hard to dismiss its raw power and creative craftsmanship. Maybe not a perfect film, but definitely the closest Tarantino has been to make one. 9/10"
snakejenkins,"Mar 23, 2004",7/10,"** / **** Reservoir Dogs is an interesting beginning to one of America's finest filmmakers careers. I loved Pulp Fiction in so many ways but most of which came from the last 15 minutes of the film in which we understand Samuel L. Jackson's journey in the film. It is that quality that is missing in Reservoir Dogs that, in my opinion, is the film's failing. The film is nothing but graphic pain and violence. There is nothing to endear any of the characters to us (unless you are endeared to people that like to mutilate people to hip 70's tunes). The characters have no real journey. The dialog is inventive (as we expect from Tarantino) but the plot is not. It's about violence for the sake of shocking the audience. It's disturbing in the ways that a horror film is disturbing without the payoff in the end. The film is extremely popular and that disturbs me more than the film itself."
johnnyboyz,"Jul 11, 2008",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs, at least for me, is one of those films that sneak up on you in terms of long term opinion. The first time I'd seen Reservoir Dogs was after a wave of Tarantino enthusiasm having watched and loved Pulp Fiction, a film released two years after this little masterpiece. But I was disappointed; I felt like I hadn't been taken through the roller-coaster ride of emotions; laughs and thrills that I had been with Pulp Fiction, a few months prior. But looking back and after many further viewings, Reservoir Dogs has snuck up on me because I now value it a little higher than Pulp Fiction and bizarrely enough, I get more of an emotional kick out of this film then Tarantino's follow up.Perhaps it was my naivety in regards to independent film at the time that I didn't take to this after the first viewing, but any doubts towards this not being an excellent and spell-binding film have since been laid to rest. Reservoir Dogs is a film that delves into the past from the present, setting up several characters; situations and stories within flashbacks that all combine to deliver a hair-raising climax with plenty of other dramatic, some more gruesome than others, moments thrown in for good measure. Reservoir Dogs is at its very core, a brilliant and emotionally fuelled film that twists, turns, creates doubts and delivers on levels of artistic creativity, out and out action and stupendous dialogue without ever feeling like a gimmick.Some of my favourite scenes in the film rely on slow motion such as the German Shepard police dog barking in the cloakroom amongst the other officers and Cabot (Tierney) lighting up a cigarette as he gives his opinion on the false story, smoke flying up all around him as another voice-over kicks in. Then there are the scenes in the warehouse in which Steve Buscemi playing Mr. Pink and co-producer Harvey Keitel playing Mr. White deliver some fantastic performances aided with dialogue that sums up the situation, mentality and emotions running high given that scenario they find themselves in. But the film knows how to rope us in and juxtapose our feelings and emotions without ever feeling manipulative. Some examples of this is are at the very beginning when, after a quiet and relatively subtle breakfast conversation, Mr Orange (Roth) lies screaming and bloody in the back of a car  something has gone wrong. There is also the incidence when Mr Blonde (Madsen), during that infamous 'ear' scene, leaves the action to go to his car in order to get a can of petrol. These juxtapositions and toying with the audience sums up not only the brilliance of being able to switch between scenarios but also highlights Tarantino's skill as a writer/director.The truth is that any scene that takes place in the warehouse rendez-vous is just pure genius, whether it is dialogue between two or three people or the torture scene or the unforgettable climax. A diamond robbery has gone wrong and the immediate theory of an undercover cop crops up thanks to the quick thinking of Mr. Pink; the more outgoing and independent of the thieves. But this seed planted in the audiences mind is one of a few things we are to concentrate on throughout the duration. Twinned this, we get numerous flashbacks and, indeed, flashbacks within flashbacks that tell us a greater deal of information involving the heist and the characters past situations. But here several things work at once: Nice Guy Eddie (Penn) arrives and maintains there is no 'rat', perhaps disbursing the theory of a traitor, challenging the audience to work it out. Mr. Blonde is established as someone who is just out of prison and his awkward situation involving parole officers and such doesn't faze him as he accepts the new job from his former employees of the heist. This creates a dangerous opinion of him in our minds, further emphasising the earlier opinion we had of him when it was established 'Blonde went crazy' and shot several people, including a young woman. It is an appetiser for what's to come, especially when he has a policeman at his mercy; but my favourite bit is when we learn he went to a drive-thru restaurant at a time of crisis and with a policeman in his boot.But these criminals in suits are not caricatures of mobsters from other crime/heist films. Mr. Orange screams and squeals in agony after being shot thus expelling any 'tough-guy' stereotype we may have of these guys in this genre. It is later established to great effect that he is a very humble and humane person, with bigger fish to fry. Tarantino executes a film here with random flashes of violence such as the torture scene climax and Mr. Pink's breakaway flashback. He lands his pop culture dialogue with talk of Madonna; The Silver Surfer and likens Gene Tierney to 'The Thing'. It even transpires some of the guys enjoy Lee Marvin's work. Shot on a budget with the help of Harvey Keitel but written with a budget of a lot less in mind, Reservoir Dogs shocks but entertains; humours but does not glamorise and generally gives its viewer a kick every time they watch it."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 21, 2005",7/10,"""Pulp Fiction"" had the shot in the car, and the ""Kill Bill"" movies had, well, various death scenes. But ""Reservoir Dogs""...ah, now this one will make your skin crawl. It focuses on a heist gone wrong. That's the most minimal description of the plot. Most of the movie has the various characters trying to figure out who did what. And then, there's the...well, let's just call it the ear scene. You will very likely squirm during that scene.If nothing else, we can say that Quentin Tarantino gave us a preview of his later films. Maybe his later films don't make your skin crawl, but but they all deal with lowlife culture. And you'd better believe that the characters in this movie are lowlifes. If absolutely nothing else, ""Reservoir Dogs"" shows us that violent, gross movies can be masterpieces."
dataconflossmoor,"Nov 9, 2007",10/10,"When viewing information about different movies, and their respective reviews on this website, officials posted that this movie was likened to the film ""Diner"". At first, I found this to be a very peculiar comparison!! The minute I popped this movie into the DVD player, I realized the similarity to both movies, particularly with regards to the introductory dialog... I like this type of opening scene, the gist of it being whereby the incongruity of conversation effectively depicts the twisted character portrayals of the pivotal actors in the film !! The camera angles to the coffee shop pontifications, as illustrated in ""Diner"" and in ""Resevoir Dogs"", were extremely poignant!! As was the case with ""Diner"", ""Resevoir Dogs"" depicted an overtly energetic camaraderie with everyone conversing at the coffee shop table. The film, ""Diner"" provided a succinct illustration of kindred spirits which were precocious, with ""Resevoir Dogs"" the bonds were rather macabre!! Focusing now on ""Resevoir Dogs"", that guy who was adamant about not tipping the waitress struck an intensely sensitive nerve cord with me, as I used to be in the food and beverage industry. How did I feel about that guy? Put it this way, if he thinks his manner of killing someone is gruesome and sickening, once a bunch of bartenders get a hold of him, he ain't seen nothing yet... While I detest the term ""ain't"" as it is a colloquialism for the illiterate, it is seemingly appropriate in this case!! Speaking of colloquialisms, this movie was full of them. The F word was habitually used in the film ""Resevoir Dogs"", in fact it was the movie's favorite colloquialism!! The F word is basically an interjection, however, the usage of the F word demonstrates an amazing versatility which accommodates virtually every part of speech, it is very amenable when used a as a gerund as well!! Such an excessive use of this word in ""Resevoir Dogs"" bares a precarious resemblance to the movie ""The Departed""... My G-Rated euphemisms are not displayed here because I am so delicate, rather, it is because I am aware of IMDb's comment guidelines!! This film was about a bunch of reprobates who were amused by their irrational conclusions, and delving into a complacently convoluted logic became their favorite hobby!! Why were all of the characters in this movie so thwarted? Come on!! I have to be at another appointment in about a half an hour!! When someone talks about seriously engaging in a first class felony, they get attention, once they totter with the idea of murder, people are all ears, at least they should be!! Such lamentations evoke a very lethal excoriation against the ""establishment"". Quentin Tarrantino directs this film, and, he is without a doubt, an unprecedented cannon of creativity!! His overall motif of blood and violence is his notoriously successful trademark, ""Pulp Fiction"" being his prize piece!! While compared to the movie ""Diner"" I may be one of the few who likes ""Diner"" better, of course, I am civilized!! Nevertheless, ""Resevoir Dogs"" is a remarkably well made movie which tries to use the recreation of murder as the ultimate and prevailing diatribe of circumstantial justification!! It (""Resevoir Dogs"") has an innovative approach to larceny, and a criminal's code of ethics!! You watch ""Resevoir Dogs"", I will guarantee you that you will not be bored!! The acting, the directing, and the aggregate creation of this film, falls into the category of sensational entertainment... I give this film a perfect ten!! See it when you're angry!!"
MovieAddict2016,"Jun 2, 2003",10/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is one of the rare films that lives up to its hype. Much like ""Goodfellas,"" this film did not let me down, but I actually enjoyed it much more than I ever dreamed.The film plays backwards, a bit like ""Memento."" It opens at the end, and recounts the last few days in the lives of crooks pulling a jewelry heist. But as we learn immediately in the beginning that the heist went wrong. Someone ratted to the cops; the cops showed up during the heist and all heck broke loose. But I may be getting ahead of myself.In the beginning of the film, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth) in a car. Mr. Orange has been shot. We don't know how, he just has. Mr. White brings Mr. Orange to a warehouse, and the two men enter. Eventually Mr. Pink (the wonderful Steve Buscemi) shows up, followed by Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), a crazy madman who opened fire on civilians at the jewelry heist. For the duration of the film, we are left to wonder who the cop is/was, and how everything happened.Things open up bit-by-bit. We are shown every Mr.'s life in the last few days before the heist, and what all happened. Of course, the men aren't really Mr. White, Mr. Pink, Mr. Orange and Mr. Blonde. These are their fake names for the sake of the heist. But we learn their real names and the parts they play in he robbery as the film moves on. And the last twenty minutes of this film is one of the most absorbing twenty minutes in film history. Things appear all of a sudden. For example, how Mr. Orange got shot. Once you realize who shot him and why, things start to make more sense. Because knowing who Mr. Orange is makes you wonder why he got shot. But who is Mr. Orange? Is he the cop? Or is he someone else? See the movie for yourself and figure it all out.""Reservoir Dogs"" ain't no ""Goodfellas,"" but on the level of film it is a masterpiece. The opening scene is one of the most mimicked scenes in film history. And the performances are extraordinary. Harvey Keitel fills in the shoes of Mr. White, who some said Robert De Niro would have been better for. In all respect, I do like De Niro better, and admit that the character carries many traits that De Niro's characters usually do. Cool under pressure. Smart. Always thinking. You can see his brain working like a clock. But I must also admit that Harvey Keitel did a very, very good job of bringing his character to life. You can almost see the chemistry between the actors boiling up. I like films where there aren't many characters, because you will almost always find the actors on screen giving some of the best performances of their lives. They are locked with these other actors, and their performance just gets stronger with every line they speak. Take, for instance, the tension between Mr. White and Mr. Blonde. Keitel and Madsen really go at each other, and it's great. And Buscemi, my personal favorite of the group, is not only funny, but fun to watch on screen. His performance is as great as his humor.""Reservoir Dogs"" isn't for everyone. It's rough, tough, gruff and at times sickening (see the police torture scene). But if you can handle some very strong violence and language, then this film is for you. It's got some amazing talents, some fairly unknown at the time, bringing together one well-written, well-directed film. Quentin Tarantino has said to be losing his charm for making a good film lately, but no one can forget this film.5/5 stars -John Ulmer"
dickjones-91895,"Sep 28, 2018",10/10,"I have to say- coming back to this film after so many years- it still packs a Tarantino punch. Very witty, edgy and gritty. Painful moments and perhaps some of the most violent scenes of our times. Not for the faint hearted but if you're into quirky badass gangster films, this one is for you."
BA_Harrison,"Mar 15, 2014",9/10,"There are two ways one can view a film like Reservoir Dogs (and, indeed, much of Quentin Tarantino's work): a) as an uninspired hodge-podge of ideas blatantly lifted from countless other movies (in this case, a large helping of '80s Hong Kong action thriller City On Fire with countless 'nods' to other crime classics along the way), or b) as an exciting, stylish and highly entertaining exercise in revisionist film-making that sees a bold director mining the work of others to forge a classic of his own.Even though I find description a) applicable to a fair number of QT's films, I cannot help but fall in the latter camp with his debut offering, finding it to be a testament to his deep understanding and appreciation of his medium and his remarkable acuity as both writer and director (he acts in the film too, but two out of three ain't bad, I suppose). In the hands of a lesser film-maker, such an 'homage' would simply be deemed a lazy and unethical exercise in plagiarism, but with Quentin at the helm, infusing proceedings with his unique sense of cool, the whole affair becomes a mesmerising melange of movie-making techniques, a patchwork of pulp excellence that bristles with pithy dialogue and contains many a memorable moment.I can't say the same about Jackie Brown, Kill Bill Vol.2, Death Proof or even Django Unchained."
marwanF9,"Jul 29, 2023",10/10,"Just wow .. What a masterpiece .. This is the third trip with my third director after Scorsese and Kubrick and now the role of Tarantino and frankly impressed me from the first film .. His way of narrating is great even though it's his first movie .. I loved the use of music in the film, especially the music of the 70s .. A film about a robbery, but you don't see a robbery in it and at the same time it grabs your attention throughout the film .. The dialogues are great .. Tarantino's way of writing scenes is very fascinating .. A film that makes you get along and enter into literally every dialogue with them .. A film full of violence, but surprisingly fun .. It's a fun movie to watch, but at the same time it hurts .. A lot of twists to take out and a great shooting angle .. I expect that this is where Tarantino really got his start and formed his own style .. A low-budget but great movie you don't find that much in the Hollywood world .. Tarantino's first film and first masterpiece .. A very great movie .. The negative that bothered me about the film is that sometimes there is a big exaggeration in the violence, an exaggeration in the length of the dialogue and it makes me feel lost .. But in general it's a terrible movie, it's an unforgettable movie and you have to re-watch it every once in a while .. My rating is 8/10."
TOMNEL,"Jul 26, 2005",7/10,"stars:Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel, Lawerence Tierney, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Eddie Bunker, Kirk Baltz, Randy Brooks, Quentin Tarantino and the voice of Steven Wright.plot: 6 strangers, a boss and his son make a plan to rob a museum, but the robbery doesn't go as planned when the copes come. Someone set them up, but who was it?review: This movie really has a good feel to it and has the usual good acting and cast that you'd expect from Quentin Tarantino, but maybe the dialogue goes way too far. This film starts out where Tim Roth(the undercover cop that they think is a thief) is shot and dying, and instead of being in extreme pain, he talks. I love this movie and could watch it over and over again and I do recommend it, but this is a movie that's trying to be more realistic. The way they just jibber-jabber on is stupid. On the brighter side, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi are great, and Lawerence Tierney is perfect.my rating-B(85%). rated R for some scenes of strong violence, language and some brief sexual discussions. 97 minutes."
mo-mack-daddy,"Jun 24, 2008",8/10,"Now don't think I'm being biased on my opinion because Quentin Tarantino is my favorite writer/director hands down, but you've gotta admit, this is one awesome movie. Another thing that makes this so special is that this is the first movie I've ever seen. But enough about that. This movie is down right amazing. The performances (especially by Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen, who plays a convincing psychopath) we're incredible. Also great and original, was the plot (about a bunch of criminals who team up to commit a diamond heist, but turning on each other when it goes haywire), but most of all, the script was the glue that held the movie together. It was funny, cool, pop cultered, and vulgar. The only thing that let me down was the short length (compared to other Quentin Tarantino epics), and the ending, but overall, it was a fantastic movie experience and one of the best movies ever made! Watch it!"
yarborough,"Oct 15, 2001",N/A,"The idea that Quentin Tarantino could be seen as a great filmmaker for ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" is ridiculous, and ""Reservoir Dogs"" is proof exhibit A. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is simply one of the most shamelessly plot-driven movies I have ever seen. First of all, what is the point of the commode story? In the movie, the crooks are supposed to keep their mouths shut, but Tarantino has Mr. Orange go on and on, pointlessly, about the commode story just so Tarantino can make an attempt at art filmmaking by showing Mr. Orange talking to the actual police officers in the bathroom and dry his hands in slow motion. Talking that much would only make it more obvious that Mr. Orange is a policeman, anyway. Also, as one viewer pointed out, Mr. Orange doesn't shoot Mr. Blonde before Mr. Blonde cuts off the police officer's ear. Want to know why? Because Tarantino needed Mr. Orange to hear the bad guys say they were going to return to the warehouse after ditching the cars, but he also needed the ear-cutting scene. What else was there to do except make Mr. Orange not give a damn about the police officer, which is totally ridiculous. Also, why in God's name was Mr. Blonde going to set fire to the police officer? Wouldn't that have drawn attention to the warehouse hideout? Sure, it would. But Tarantino threw out that logic just so he could make a ""thrilling"" scene as Mr. Blonde prepares to set fire to the police officer. Also, what sense does it make to have the warehouse in the middle of a neighborhood? What a bunch of smart crooks. It's no wonder they couldn't snoop out the undercover cop.This movie shouldn't even have made as little as it did (one million, I believe). And it figures that after about three years Tarantino's name dropped out of sight."
Thanos_Alfie,"Mar 15, 2021",8/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a Crime - Thriller movie in which we watch a group of criminals suspecting one another as a police informant after a jewelry heist. Soon things escalate and they have to figure out the truth before it's too late for them.I liked this movie very much because it had a simple but very interesting plot with many plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Quentin Tarantino was for one more time simply amazing and he did an excellent job on how he presented his characters and their connection to the crime. The interpretations of Harvey Keitel who played as Mr. White / Larry, Tim Roth who played as Mr. Orange / Freddy and Michael Madsen who played as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega were very good. To sum up, I have to say that ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a nice, interesting thriller movie and I recommend everyone to watch it because it is undoubtedly considered as one of the first masterpieces of Quentin Tarantino."
nydymfp,"Dec 25, 2024",10/10,"A very good movie to watch at home with your family! The film offers a perfect blend of engaging storytelling and captivating visuals that appeal to all age groups. The plot is well-paced, keeping you at the edge of your seat while seamlessly weaving in humorous moments that lighten the mood. The characters are well-developed, each bringing something unique to the story, making it relatable and enjoyable. It's a heartwarming narrative packed with valuable lessons about friendship, perseverance, and the importance of family. The cinematography is impressive, with vibrant colors and stunning shots that enhance the viewing experience. Overall, it's a delightful movie that entertains and resonates on a personal level, making it a must-watch for a cosy family night in."
JackHodges-13503,"Mar 7, 2025",8/10,"Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs (1992) is the cinematic equivalent of a high-stakes poker game where everyone is bluffing, sweating, and occasionally bleeding out. A crime film that rewrites the rulebook, it spends more time in a warehouse full of paranoia and snappy dialogue than actually showing the botched heist at its core. And somehow, that's exactly what makes it brilliant.The cast, featuring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi (in his natural state of exasperation), delivers performances so sharp they could cut glass. The script crackles with Tarantino's signature blend of profanity and pop culture, proving that even hardened criminals can have heated debates about Madonna lyrics.With a killer soundtrack, a color-coded cast, and enough tension to snap steel, Reservoir Dogs is a masterclass in minimalist storytelling. It's violent, hilarious, and impossibly cool, just don't expect a straightforward heist flick. Oh, and Mr. Pink was totally right."
aristotelisanagnostoudis,"Mar 17, 2021",8/10,"A classic Tarantino Masterpiece, maybe his best. This movie is a really interesting crime story that keeps you focused till the end. The killing scenes are out of the ordinary, which now is a landmark of the director. I would totally recommend this movie to people who love crime movies or just love Tarantino movies."
amarjunchu,"Nov 12, 2017",10/10,This is one of those classic movies that have aged very well. I watched an anime named Baccano which I really liked and I wanted more things like that then I read about how Baccano was inspired by Tarantino's style so I decided to go ahead and watch this movie and I gotta say its excellent. Its each and every dialogue is just there to entertain you and it does its job pretty well. I never found myself getting bored and always eager to see whats next. The non linear style also adds to the fun and I really like this type of movies which are like a puzzle which we can solve as we go along the joy filled ride!

JoanOoG,"Feb 16, 2023",7/10,"The truth is, the first time I saw it, I left with a bad taste in my mouth. I don't know, I just felt that I didn't fully like the movie. I was expecting something different, a different plot or better development.I felt perfectly that instead of lasting approximately one hour forty, it could only last one hour. I feel that the plot is a bit bland and I must admit that at certain moments, it got boring.What I can highlight from the film is how mentally ill the characters are and how two-faced they are, like ""Mr. Rubio,"" who at first seems to be a kind person, but in the end, it turns out to be the opposite. Also, I like the typical Tarantino scenes where everything is resolved by pointing a gun at each other. I sincerely hope that when I see the movie again, I like it better."
sol-,"Nov 15, 2017",7/10,"Suspicion and paranoia overwhelm a band of criminals after a tightly plotted heist goes sour in this feature film debut from Quentin Tarantino. The film is built on an interesting dynamic with none of the robbers actually knowing one another since they were all hired by a third party, given code names and were told to not tell each other their true identity. How much can they really trust each other's word and could one of them be a police informant? Intriguing as all this might sound, one's mileage with the movie is almost certain to vary depending on one's tolerance of the dialogue-heavy script. While some of the violence is quite brutal, there is precious little of it as the film mostly consists of the characters bantering back and forth, which unfortunately has a tendency to feel repetitive. The imbalanced time spent on each criminal's background feels a little odd too with some of them far more developed than others. All that said and done, the revelation of the police informant's identity is very well done and the second half of the film has many intense moments. The final few scenes are especially memorable with an outcome that resonates in the mind long after the film is over."
Leon-56,"Jun 28, 2002",1/10,"What to say.. a cliche story, badly told, with non believable characters 1/4"" deep.

jay-22797,"Jan 7, 2025",10/10,"The Fallen Dog ""by Quentin Tarantino's early works. Although it cannot be compared to Leonardo da Vinci's first egg or Einstein's first bench, regardless of whether it is great or not, Quentin's career in film has considerable value.To be brave, Director Quentin's catfish like face is as ""violent"" as his film, striking the viewer's heart and becoming more and more sinister as they watch it. Sorry, my words are disrespectful. Actually, they are not. Let me express my love for Quentin's film style superficially.Before the Water Dog starts, there are a bunch of bad ABCs that need to be blocked, most of which come from Young Master Kun's mouth. A table of 'party representatives' sat together, pulling from Mai Jie's' like a virgin' to the female servers who relied on tips to make a living, whether it was Toby Cheung or Toby Wong. This is the restless, excited, and confused 1980s. Since then, there have been signs of violence. Violent language is only enough to warm up the atmosphere, and only by using real weapons and knives can one gain momentum. Also note that this is not a Saturday movie, keep an eye on the kids and keep the remote control safe. Don't say Quentin is unkind, he didn't warn you."

And then I got it.I had never really watched a movie before that was so dialogue focused AND was also clever, interesting and funny.If you want a different experience, turn up the sound and enjoy the movie with your eyes closed!"
drexxau,"May 25, 2021",9/10,"Let's keep it short and simple:
This movie is pretty straight forward and set in stone the concept on which Tarantino would later build many more and also more complex stories.I can't decide on which is my favorite, but this one always comes to mind first.There is just no scene that could be cut out. If you stick with it to the end, you will not be disappointed! Great soundtrack as per usual.The way he tells the story with time jumps is not only there to make it more tense, but is told in a way where we learn the most important things about a character purely through dialogue with others at first and get the blanks and plot-twists filled in at a later point.The most interesting thing is, that this movie is still enjoyable after you know everything there is to know about the characters.Maybe it even gets better, since you get to sit back, relax and let the story and chars just unfold upon you.I'd give this a 10/10 if I only scored Tarantino Movies. Since it has to compare to other movies as well, this one is too niche for a 10."
antoniokowatsch,"Nov 24, 2017",9/10,"Reservoir dogs is a movie about organized crime. Well, it's really about a couple of hired guns who start to lose their cool when a diamond heist goes FUBAR. Everybody is fast to point fingers. ""Someone must be a rat!"", they proclaim as they try to make sense of what just happened. It's fast paced and has a lot of action to go along with. The cast was really strong and so were the performances. When you watch a movie with well-known actors and you start to forget or should I rather say disassociate their real identity with the characters that they're portraying that's when you know that something magical is happening. This movie has all of the above.Some might criticize the sporadic use of racial slurs in dialogues but truth be told; this is how mobsters back in the days used to talk. It adds an extra layer of realism to the movie.The opening scene of the movie is easily one of the most memorable movie scenes and sets the right mood for what's about to happen (in a a way). A bunch of guys sitting in a diner; jerking around and talking about ridiculous stuff. It gives you a good idea about the group dynamics.  Who gets along with who? What kind of people are they really?  Once the diamond heist fails we get to see each character from a different perspective; under extreme circumstances. That's when you realize that all of these guys are real criminals and things start to spiral out of control as suspicions arise as to who the rat is.While the movie is ultimately serious and sometimes brutal there are a lot of really funny scenes to contrast this reality with. Like e.g. the scene where all of them get code names assigned to them.  Let's just say that Mr. Pink didn't like his code name. I personally think that this scene was one of the funniest movie scenes I've ever seen. Took me totally by surprise because I wasn't expecting this type of witty and hilarious writing.Reservoir Dogs is still one of my favorite Quentin Tarantino movies of all time. As a matter of fact one might even argue that this is the movie that kick-started his career as we now know it. It has all the Tarantino signature elements. It's super-realistic due to the frequent use of profanity and the setting. A true masterpiece."

purvesgrundy,"Nov 14, 1999",1/10,"I first saw this film when I was 15. I thought it was brilliant, really original and generally great. However, now (3 Years later) I realise it is nothing more than a pretentious piece of garbage.Sure, it looks good, but when you really get down to it it's not doing anything. It doesn't have any real substance, it's not commenting on anything, it's just a totally throwaway product. Tarantino is talking loudly and saying nothing. And THAT narrative structure - it looks and feels original, but independent and foreign movies have been doing it, better, for years and years.A truly trashy piece of postmodernism at it's worst."
jasoncrespo-56276,"Aug 16, 2023",9/10,"Quentin Tarantino films have a unique but undoubtedly interesting style, overall Tarantino only produces timeless films. Reservoir Dogs certainly does not disappoint in that area, easy 9/10.Dialogue is the name of the game, the whole movie takes place in a few locations and most of the movie is pure dialogue and yet with minimal action shots Tarantino delivers multiple high tension moments. The scenes are long but feel real, the conversations between the characters are super engaging, entertaining and most importantly believable.There is a lot of attention to detail, small little details that add to the realism of the film, like a character not having a pack of cigarettes on them so they walk over to the next room to get one. I don't know, small things like that, everything feels so natural.The vibe, the pacing, the dialogue. The unfolding of events is gripping, the sense of mystery is great and the revealing of the truth is even greater.The final scene of the movie is powerful, a lot of emotion and it doesn't drag out, once it's over it's done and that's how real life is.Great film to turn brain off to after a long day."
appusnikhil,"Sep 28, 2023",9/10,"What a great debut for Quentin! I got some Glengarry Glen Ross vibes too. I have already watched almost all of Quentin's other movies, but this was something different. The movie was shot on a tight budget, and you can notice that from the details.Regarding the movie, it features an ensemble cast, and all of them have performed at their best. It's sad that many of the actors are no longer with us. Quentin also has a role in the movie. I would like to see this adapted as a play, and that would be great. There are lots of highly charged dialogues between the lead characters, so there's no point in fast-forwarding.This is one of the greatest films ever made, and it's not lengthy. Give it a go!"
OrangeSequins,"Oct 27, 2025",8/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a sharp, intense, and memorable debut from Quentin Tarantino. It is tightly focused, driven by strong characters and bold storytelling choices that still feel impactful today.The story of a failed heist and the growing distrust among the criminals is told in a nonlinear structure that keeps tension high. Even without showing the heist itself, the film generates plenty of suspense through dialogue and confrontations that reveal just enough at the right time.The performances are great across the board. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Michael Madsen stand out, each giving their character a distinct edge. The chemistry and conflict between the group create a lot of the film's intensity.The film looks stylish and confident. Tarantino's direction, combined with snappy dialogue and a perfectly chosen soundtrack, gives the film a unique identity. It is violent and harsh in tone, but never without purpose.Overall, ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a gripping and well-executed crime thriller. The writing, performances, and structure make it a strong and impressive start to Tarantino's career."

It's a good movie, but not top250 good.
Pulp Fiction, Inglorious Basterds, Django Unchained, Hateful Eight -
Literally among my favorite movies of all time.Now, Hateful Eight has a rating of 7.8,
While Reservoir Dogs has a rating of 8.3.
The ONLY reason for this, is the nostalgia effect.
People rate Reservoir Dogs higher because they remember
how it made them feel BACK THEN.
If you take a man who hasn't seen both of these movies, today,
I'm pretty sure he will crown Hateful Eight as the superior movie.Hateful Eight is better in every aspect, yet its' rating is lower.
The dialogues are more tense, the story is way more clever,
and every scene keeps you on the edge of your seat,
let alone the beautiful scenery.So, all I'm saying is, as a big fan, this is very overrated."
ronakkotian,"Apr 3, 2020",9/10,"It's so impressive to see a film like Reservoir Dogs come along and change the entire crime genre. With a budget of around $1.5 million, it goes to show how you can do wonders regardless of how low your budget is.Reservoir Dogs follows a group of criminals that are trying to find out who amongst them is the rat after a heist goes wrong.This was Quentin Tarantino's debut film and what a debut it was! This movie is packed with a stellar cast including the likes of Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Alongside that we were introduced to Tarantino's impeccible writing. This movie grips you with its tight dialogues right from the beginning with the infamous ""Tipping"" discussion and keeps you hooked throughout its short runtime due to the talent onscreen and fast pacing. The music choices were very fitting and suited the film's tone. Whilst the film does get really violent, none of it is unnecessary. I feel it reflects the personality of each character perfectly especially Madsen's character.The performances are all very strong. Harvey Keitel does an impressive job as well as Tim Roth. Steve Buscemi and Michael Madsen are really fun to watch and make their characters really believable. Lawrence Tierney and Chris Penn are also great in their roles and play them equally well.What I really loved about the film was the way it was structured. The fact that we don't see the heist from the beginning makes the film really unpredictabe as we're constantly doubting who the rat is. There are some really funny and memorable moments throughout that make you realise why this movie is such a classic. The only problem I had was the way some scenes were shot but it also shows how much Tarantino has grown as a director.Reservoir Dogs is really entertaining. None of the characters feel boring, the plot doesn't stray and the fantastic writing by Tarantino gave an amazing first impression of his undeniable talent."
Steffi_P,"Dec 14, 2011",7/10,"If you go on a screen writing course or read a filmmakers manual, it's likely that the one of the first things you will be told is to minimize dialogue to the bare essentials; that film is a primarily visual medium; that the images should be allowed to speak without unnecessary talking. And yet that notion is consistently challenged by one of the most popularly and critically acclaimed directors of the last two decades – Quentin Tarantino. In this, his debut, the dialogue is a constant accompaniment. The only time there is more than ten seconds without a spoken word is the credits.The gangster movie has long had a strong relationship with dialogue. That's one of the reasons there were so many of them in the early talkie era. The wisecracks are part of what makes the genre, and Reservoir Dogs contains some choice lines, like ""You shoot me in a dream you'd better wake up and apologise"". Tarantino – quite deliberately I'm sure – builds the story around numerous gangster clichés. Mr White, the hood with too much humanity. Mr Blond, the sociopathic killer. Mr Orange, the ""rat"". The dialogue is often used, not just to throw in some tough guy banter, but to add layers to these gangland relationships. Mr Orange tells the rest of the gang the ""commode story"" in order to convince them he's a real criminal. The story itself is about a narrow escape with some drugs under the noses of a bunch of cops. Meanwhile the cops in this fictional episode are talking about ""a civilian who came this close to getting blown away"". The anecdote-within-an-anecdote gives a tense commentary upon Orange's tenuous position.Another advantage of this dialogue-based approach is that there is a lot of information for the actors to play upon and a lot of time to get into their roles. Harvey Keitel is very impressive, personifying the honourable mobster. Lawrence Tierney, who was playing lead men of dubious morality four decades earlier, clearly knows just what his character is about, and portrays the formidable crime boss with laid-back ease. Michael Madsen is simply perfect as the creepy, quiet type (although quiet type in this context only means he pauses for breath between lines), giving off an intense presence while barely making a move. Steve Buscemi and Tim Roth both overact a little, although admittedly in Buscemi's case it is to good effect in depicting the weasely character, and even when Roth is waxing lyrical he makes you realise how poetic some of this dialogue is. Maybe it needs a bit of theatricality.Despite of his writing so much wordage for his own movie, Tarantino is still very much a visual director, whose camera seems to be finding angles on the action other than those which focus directly on the actors as they're talking. You have for example the wheeling camera in the opening scene, Tarantino's voice disembodied, a long-shot down the corridor as Keitel and Buscemi discuss their predicament, and the lengthy close-up on Keitel as Buscemi rants offscreen. Actually, these are techniques you see an awful lot in very early sound movies around 1930, when sound itself was seen as more of a gimmick than something fully integrated. It's as if the dialogue has its own entity, gliding over images like that radio show soundtrack.And indeed, a lot of the dialogue is simply there for effect. The essential exposition lines are all there as they should be, but unlike a more typically sparse screenplay, they are buried amongst reams of chitchat that serves only to amuse the audience and add realism and depth to the world in which the story takes place. Tarantino's opening spiel about Madonna's Big Dick is a prime example – completely irrelevant to plot or themes, uttered by a character who does barely anything else of significance in the whole rest of the movie. It seems it is just a funny little observation that Tarantino wanted to say (and, appropriately enough, it is literally him saying it). What we are witnessing with Reservoir Dogs is the beginning of dialogue for dialogue's sake."

slightlymad22,"Aug 11, 2019",9/10,"I just watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time in a while.This movie blew me away when I first watched it in the early 1990's and I still love it. I have always considered this Quentin Tarantino's best movie.The dialogue is amazing. After watching so much awful dialogue in movies lately, I appreciated this even more, this dialogue just pops!!We only see parts of the escape from bungled diamond heist in flashbacks, and we do not actually see the heist itself, instead we get the aftermath.As for the acting, everyone is superb. None more so than Michael Madsen, he has a menacing screen presence only a few actors achieve!! He is amazing. We're it not for Madsen, Harvey Kietel would have walked away with the movie. Steve Buscemi is fantastic as the frantic Mr Pink too. There is seriously not a weak link in the cast.Amazingly. this was filmed on a budget of $1.2 million.This is quite an achievement for a first time writer/director. A great movie.I was shocked to see it only grossed $2.8 million at the domestic box office. It grossed £6.3 million in the UK. True story it did not get a home video release until 1995."
mrdjx,"Nov 18, 2010",8/10,"Reservoir Dogs is the debut film of director Quentin Tarrantino. While its not a masterpiece like his later effort Pulp Fiction. For a first time effort coming from a video store clerk who didn't go to film school, this is a remarkable achievement in the world of independent cinema.The storyline is simple. Crime lord, Joe Cabot and his son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie have arranged a diamond heist. To cover their tracks, they hire several associates who don't know each other personally and thus can't give information out in case they get arrested. These associates are Mr White (played by Harvy Keitel), Mr Pink (played by Steve Buscemi), Mr Orange (Tim Roth), Mr Blonde (Michael Madson), Mr Brown (in a cameo by Quentin Tarrantino) and Mr Blue (played by real life former criminal Eddie Bunker). The heist immediately fails ending with a massacre that leaves Brown and Blue dead, Orange has been shot, leaving it to others to figure out who snitched them. What makes the plot interesting is not in the story itself but how it's told. When discussing mainstream cinema, Andy Warhol said that ""All the interesting bits of a film are left in the cutting room floor"". Reservoir Dogs is the anti thesis of Hollywood filmmaking. Yes, the heist happens but we don't see it. What we get however, is the events that happen before and after, feeding enough details to figure out what happened.This is Tarrantino's skill as both story teller and director, he can make details or characters we don't even see seem significant. Part of this is easily attributed to the excellent script. This is where the dialogue deserves a special mention. In an ordinary film, the dialogue is typically used just to explain the plot to the audience. Tarrantino breaks this rule by letting his characters converse from Brown's graphic explanation of Madonna's ""Like a Virgin"" to the humorous interaction between Eddie and Blonde. By avoiding the usual traps that plague Hollywood films, Tarrantino manages to make a movie solely dedicated to its characters and their knee jerk reactions to the heist.Raising the mark even further for the film is the carefully chosen ensemble cast. Harvey Keitel is superb as Mr White. His skills shine in the films early scenes where he shows his empathy with the dying Mr Orange. One might say that this portrayal is almost the exact opposite of the typical hardened criminal.Michael Madson, whilst having a limited screen time delivers the films most infamous scene as Mr Blonde, a psychotic criminal who is both brutal and cool. His dry deadpan delivery sets up most of the films tension. Perhaps the most memorable performance however goes to Steve Buscemi as Mr Pink. Out of the entire cast or characters, Pink is the most interesting which is ironic given that he is the only character we know nothing about. Buscemi manic performance proves equal match for Pinks loyalty and concerns about what is ""professional"" in the crime world. It is the films finest and most articulated performance. Reservoir Dogs is still not perfect though and I wouldn't recommend it to all people. For starters, Tim Roth's performance as Mr Orange while strong suffers greatly from his constantly slipping vernacular. You won't be sure is he's Italian American Mafioso, a street wise kid or simply a whiny brat. Thankfully, his most of his dialogue is kept to minimum as he spends much of his screen time lying in a pool of blood. Secondly the level of violence in this movie is bloody and gratuitous, peaking at the torture scene which was reportedly disturbing enough to prompt several people to leave the theatre. Yes the film is violent, but in the stylized way of the Hong Kong films that inspired it. Thirdly, the film is full of enough profanity laden dialogue to fill a text book. I don't actually mind it though, as it makes sense given that these characters are p*ssed off at the failure of such a carefully planned heist. But if you cant stomach excessive bad language, then isn't the film for you. These arguments should not be seen as detractors to the film though. Would I recommend Reservoir Dogs? That depends. If you're a cinephile, a pop culture fanatic or just want to see a refreshing film, by all means do. If however you're a concerned parent who wants to see something with the children or someone who cant stand such graphic violence and language, then avoid it all costs. Make no mistake though, this is a fantastic film that paved the way for the way for the career of a talented director."
coltongoose,"Jul 18, 2021",10/10,"From his original film, to his modern pieces, this is the best film Tarantino has made hands down."
kimma-moonshine,"Oct 15, 2014",10/10,"This is easily one of my favourite movies of all time. Quentin Tarantino has always had a knack for writing great dialogue in his movies, which spend less time dazzling you with explosions and hot actors and more time pulling you in with unique story lines and entertaining discussions that's not to say he hasn't had his fair share of adding flair to his films but I've always felt the focus was more on his characters and what they have to say as opposed to what they were doing. Reservoir Dogs is easily one of his best films, there is a certain sense of simplicity to the scenes, the writing is flawless and the characters are entertaining."
IMDB2892,"Oct 5, 2025",7/10,"Cast of a-level stars with a solid storyline. Recommend this film to anyone who likes a classy crime movie. The movie appears to be set in LA, and it fits well with what takes place. Each character has a style and they play their roles well. The film is gritty and shot down from earth, no special effects and unbelievable stunts. The story is a bit hazy in memory but what stands out is the cast members. The suit and tie aspect adds a nice touch of class."
PCC0921,"Mar 31, 2022",8/10,"Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut is a rollercoaster of a film. He uses plot devices, that were still fairly infantile at the time. His use of flashbacks, flash forwards and plotlines, coming from different angles, was still something that wasn't done a lot. Basically, the plot of the film revolves around a group of criminals, who attempt a jewelry heist, that goes bad. Once they all start to gather at the safe house afterwards, the problems begin to increase. One problem being, there is a mole in the nest. Each of the members of the gang are tagged with aliases, using different colors, in order to hide as much of what each other knows about each other. It is a way of hiding as much information, that police might get out of them later. You have Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), just to name the main ones.Tarantino's gritty storytelling techniques thrive in this film. This film is a textbook example of his style of exploitation. His need to give homage to classic 1970s-style, sensationalized crime thrillers, utilizing the exploitative aspects of those films, is what makes this film a real good one see. That is what makes all his films good ones to see. His use of sub-genres, taking them to their limits, exploring their gritty, violent, shocking sides, is what his style is all about. He also knows how to use them to his advantage, crafting a slick story, full of energy. His actors put all they can into the film, mostly from the respect that he garners from them. They are all very convincing performances, including Tarantino himself, as Mr. Brown. This is the Tarantino film you need to see first. It harkens to you, that which is yet to come. It is a fantastic filmmaking career, that is 30+ years strong now.7.8 (B- MyGrade) = 8 IMDB."
djurrepower,"Mar 10, 2022",7/10,"Certainly not for everybody. It's a dialogue heavy film, with characters mostly just bouncing off of each other. But the characters are very well acted, and the movie certainly has its style with most of the movie taken place in the same place. All in all, character heavy driven movie wich isn't for everybody. But overall well made film.7/10: quite good for what it is."
leonardwatson212,"Jun 22, 2007",1/10,"Unlike most of Tarantino's films this one I would not give a negative rating to. It shares all of the things that I hate about his other films (bouncing around in time & sequence, unnecessary blood & violence, no plot and no resolution) with the rest of his films, but for some reason this one does not make me want to sort my socks instead. I would still say that you should not waste your time watching this movie unless you really just want to waste time. The only redeeming quality of this film is that you can watch this one film and and you will have just seen every Quentin Tarantino movie ever made, because they are all the same. Just be sure that you can handle the violence and the blood because that is about all you are going to get from this film."
wc1n3xx,"Nov 12, 2001",N/A,"I thought it was boring, rambling and way over rated - and I did watch it three times to see whether I'd missed something as everyone was raving about it.It wasn't THAT original. Was it?The expectation of many people telling you to go and see was a bit too much for me, I think just maybe there must have been something deeply subliminal in the film, and my brain just doesn't have that part.Hype."
dogukanbsh,"Apr 18, 2021",8/10,"Tarantino must be my favorite script writer. As he says ""A story unfolds."". I knew my expectations and all the talks without watching the movie, i even knew who was the rat but it kept shocking me with those sudden moves. Script and the way he is telling it is breath-taking.At first sight visuals seems just average but then you realize the camera moves do an important job of telling the story. Especially, in the first tip scene.Only thing that i didn't like about the whole film is ending which was so sudden. If i were him, i would show a bit more to cool down the viewer. Paper unfolded but it is tore down suddenly..."

Many people don't like a non linear story but it works here. Quentin needs to be mentioned as this film would not be what it is if he didn't direct it. Tim roths character moves basically once in the whole movie and that shows how acting is all you need to make a movie great. action and spectacle are in this movie but the story is intriguing yet short and snappy"
aciessi,"Feb 21, 2013",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs was Quentin Tarantino's first motion picture. But even as early as his first try, you can see every element that defines Tarantino as the unmatched filmmaking legend that he is revered as. It just might be the greatest indie film of all time. No budget, no SFX, no big sets and no wide distribution. But the amount of emotion, humor, sadism and reality that this film conveys is more extraordinary than any big name blockbuster. The plot of the film is brief, but it works. It's about a well organized heist that goes terribly wrong. Truth is, there is a rat in the whole operation, but who? With that in place, Tarantino takes us beyond what is said on paper and retraces the steps it took these men to get to the predicament they are in now. We see the back stories of Mr. White, Mr. Blonde and Mr. Orange, all without ever meaning to place them in the middle of the conflict. Its a movie that only the viewer can interpret, and the important facts are placed at the forefront to help come to a conclusion. This information works in favor of the main narrative. Some have complained about not hearing the origins of Mr. Pink, Mr. Brown, Mr. Blue, Nice Guy Eddie and Joe Cabot. I agree. Perhaps more clarification of their purposes might have enhanced the narrative. Perhaps it would have answered the obvious question, What was the point of this whole operation? I'm sure Quentin would have made the film twice as long and incorporated all of their stories had he made the film today. Needless to say, It does not take away from the experience. In fact, the mysteriousness makes it even more entertaining. Also, Reservoir Dogs will always fall under the controversy of being too violent for mainstream audiences, as well as being highly unnecessary. Well, I disagree. Violence is the name of the game in the life of being a Dog. If that means chopping off an ear while dancing to K-Billy's Super Sounds of the Seventies, then why not? Reservoir Dogs doesn't exist to share a moral. Rather, it shows to us just how something so right can go so wrong. Even if the right was wrong in the first place. Reservoir Dogs is the precursor to the rest of Tarantino's career, and to get started watching the long journey of his success, make sure you pop in this amazing flick first."
SquigglyCrunch,"Feb 8, 2016",6/10,"I went into this movie with some expectations. Having liked all of the Tarantino films that I've seen I was hoping for another great movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't really anything special.Reservoir Dogs is about a bunch of criminals hiding out after a robbery went horribly wrong and waiting for each other to arrive. While I like the idea of everyone waiting in one place and having trust issues, I've seen it before in Tarantino's 'The Hateful Eight'. I do realize that Reservoir Dogs came out over 20 years before, but The Hateful Eight felt more like an improvement off of this movie. Plus it just shows that Tarantino is reusing ideas at this point. While I did really like The Hateful Eight and not so much Reservoir Dogs, I believe in giving credit where credit is due. Considering Reservoir Dogs came out first, I'm giving it credit for having the idea first, but The Hateful Eight did it much, much better. Otherwise, the plot is generally well done. I liked the beginning the most. For the last twenty or so minutes it's just kind of lame. It's anti-climatic in the end, and very obvious when and how it will end. For a Tarantino movie this is quite disappointing. It's probably the most average way for a Tarantino movie to end, only without the awesome overdone violence and tension.The characters are alright, but relatively rushed. They all have their defining characteristics, but it never really goes deeper than that.Overall Reservoir Dogs isn't anything special. It just feels like the most average Tarantino movie ever, and while it was one of his first movies, it doesn't hold up as the classic that everyone makes it out to be. It just feels like a worse version of The Hateful Eight. In the end I probably wouldn't recommend this movie unless your really interested in it. I really didn't enjoy it that much, and I'm only giving it credit because it probably inspired the idea for my favorite Tarantino movie."

conker123456789-2,"Mar 11, 2006",1/10,"This movie just bored me no end. It was so painful to watch. The direction by Quentin Tarintino was terrible and the actors were very miscasted. I watched this with my friend and he also thought it was terrible. Nothing to admire, no action, just cussing. There's no point going to the message boards saying that you don't like it, because if you do people at the message board will use anything as an excuse for you to love it. ""If you don't like it you don't get or you're an idiot. It was Quentin Tarintino's first film, go easy on him."" Don't let tall this get in the way of your opinion, because this movie was stupid and pointless. Very predictable too. So I wont even say anymore.I recommend it to anyone who loves Quentin Tarintino. By the way, I find Quentin Tarintino overrated, everything he does people think it's great, but it's not."
MovieAlien,"Aug 25, 1999",N/A,"All a Los Angels video store clerk had to do was show a script to an acting teacher. Lucky for him, this teacher happened to be the wife of Harvey Kietel, and since he's notorious for his depictions of mobs and the underbelly, Harv just happened to like it and decided to contribute funding it into a feature length film. Unfortunately for the movie, it's not too original and at times non-linear. It's been said that it took elements from Hong Kong director Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" and redefined film noir. Other way around, it was a rip-off to ""City on Fire,"" and an insult to film noir. Triteness is common in the world of Hollywood. I'm glad James Woods turned away from it.Added on to the stolen plot of the 1987 movie was gratuitous uses of the ""N"" word, 70s music/tends and anal sex. If this were done in one movie, it would be an unusual touch. If it's referenced in all of the director's movies, it's a lack of an imagination. And that is indeed the case if you take a look at Quentie's filmography.A movie that leaves you feeling something for the characters, even if they're low life scum, is crucial for an ending. After bullets went flying before the fade-out, I came away feeling nothing at all.Maybe that's just me; maybe it's just an irony that mediocrity outnumbers the innovative worthwhile in the entertainment industry."
owen-watts,"Mar 2, 2023",8/10,"Tarantino's feature length debut, despite some problematical tendencies in the dialogue of his intentionally unlikeable cast, has aged tremendously well. The twisty narrative rarely drags, the tension is amazingly drawn and the performances are fantastic. The real shock for me was the late Chris Penn who has such gravitas as Nice Guy Eddie that he pretty much carries the whole film with his amazingly pointy shoes. For a video shop guy to come out of the gate with this level of insane swagger is still a wild achievement all these decades later. Believe the ancient hype and get all of those 70s cheesy tunes rammed into your head for life as I now have."

fistofgonzo,"Aug 27, 2022",10/10,"In my opinion this is Quentin Tarantino's best movie. The story is stripped back and lends itself perfectly to what Tarantino does best: hearty dialogue. And nowhere in his catalogue is the dialogue better than it is here: we begin with casual lunch conversation and end with a heated standoff, which tension ramping itself up all the way through. It's a visceral film, but not nearly as gratuitous as his other movies. Here, our imaginations give the violence all of its impact and it makes for a more intense experience. The fact that almost all of the film takes place in one setting is a perfect example of ""less is more"". I for one would love to see Tarantino make one more gangster movie before he retires."

The movie is realistic,has logic and i realy like that,you understand why the characters do what they do.Something that i love about Tarantino is that he is not afraid to kill his characters, and thats so exciting,beacause with Tarantino you never know whos gonna live and whos gonna die. To be honest i don't find much to complain about the movie, I loved it.Reservoir Dogs is one of those movies that you don't see every day."

joeydean61869,"Jun 4, 2008",8/10,"***1/2 out of **** starsOkay...I've been a big fan of Tarantino's work since he exploded onto the scene in the early nineties. I've watched Dogs several times and watched it again tonight on IFC with the instantaneous intention to finally review it. Not for the squeamish, this one: large pools of blood; screams of pain; a severed ear; people (cops mostly) being blasted with deafening gun shots...so how can Dogs be so darn funny with so much carnage and suffering? Well, it's what makes Tarantino so darn special; the melding of gut-busting dialogue and gore, along with the prototypical wardrobes of black and white gangsta suits. Let us not forget Quentin's love for 70s nostalgia as well, which in one case is evident in his characters parleying about bygone blacksploitation movies and television shows. And what a fantastic ingredient to use Steven Wright's dead-pan voice to introduce all those archaic B-siders on K Billy's Super Sounds of the 70s.A lot of Reservoir Dogs could be a stage production. I can easily imagine sitting front row in a playhouse watching all the actors hit their marks with precision, and hearing their voices reverberate throughout the building. Obviously, I speak of the warehouse scenes. For me, this is quite an accolade because how often can actors work so wonderfully and successfully in two different mediums with the same story? I realize that Dogs has never been made into a play, but it could be...don't you think?Only a half-wit would bitch about Tarantino's formulaic storytelling. Does every movie have to begin, then go on to the very next thing, and the very next thing, and the next, and the next? Tick tock tick tock? Zzzzzzzz. What brilliance to amalgamate past, present and future with such rotating uniqueness. Keep teaching your audience to tune-up Quentin. Nothing wrong with starting your story somewhere in the middle and going anywhere you want from there. Way to go man, is what I say.It seems as if Tarantino's career will be a bit like Kubrick's: quality instead of quantity. The bummer is having to wait for his next project, which can never come soon enough for me. What I love most about Q is his obvious great love for film-making. He seemingly has a child-like enthusiasm for the creative process, and his love for simply viewing movies, let along making them, is very evident.Keep making movies as if you're watching them for $9.50 like most of us Quentin. If you do, you'll always have an audience that is just as excited about your stories as you are!"
justcoolb,"May 15, 2008",6/10,This movie was a total waste of time. The acting was OK and it just was not very interesting. The majority of the movie was swearing and shooting and flashbacks. This movie reminded me of The Departed. Mindless killing and pure stupidity. All this might be because I have not liked but one or two of Tarentinos films. However i watched this movie like all with an open mind and i was completely bored for the entire first half of the movie. The rest of the movie got me interested and then dropped it with the bad ending and the mindless violence and stupidity. It is just not very entertaining to me. Somehow people like it enough for it to be on the top 250 but i think it should be on bottom 250.
dannojames,"Feb 1, 2021",8/10,"I always find that films with tons of stars are more often rubbish, well that's not the case with Reservoir Dogs, or any of Tarantino's films. His obvious strong point is using big name actors effectively in casting them often in that exact spot where they exist in culture. This, his first film, is crystal clear that he almost needs to work in this way. I'd be curious to see him work with complete unknowns on one of his projects."

But I did enjoy this movie. The acting was fantastic and the plot was also very cool. The torture scene with the cop was very disturbing. Not to sound sick, but I do like these kind of movies. I loved how all the actors portrayed their roles. It just got too predictable for me. I knew who the rat was before he squealed. But I won't spoil.Like I said, it's a great film. I just need to jump into a new genre. But for a director's debut, I stand and applaud Quentin. The man knows his work.7/10"
bambanzeboy,"Mar 18, 2006",4/10,"I watched Ringo Lam's city on fire and I was upset to see how Quentin stole everything from it to make Reservoir Dogs, Yes I like the way he combines different movies to make one but reservoir dogs was like an American Version of city on fire with white actors (not in a bad way).I know it has been said before, but I recommend you to watch City on fire, things that didn't make sens or if you don't want to waste your time listening to those tough guys talking about what they did, City on fire will just show you what happened in a small box of time.But anyway, I think Mr Blond and Pink made it look pretty though.I am sorry, just in case he paid for the rights."
MrTomCherry,"Sep 24, 2019",N/A,"The movie revolves around a heist gone wrong and it is Tarantino's debut. I've never watched it before and finally did in september of 2019 because I've been listening, for all these years, how good the movie is and how everyone is hyping it. At the end it was disappointing. It is, in my opinion, highly overrated probably because Tarantino directed it. It is a decent extremly bloody heist movie and an OK pastime on a lazy weekend, but a masterpiece it is certainly not."
brosseauphilippe,"Mar 28, 2022",10/10,"Already an inveterate cinephile and brat stuffed with references, he offers us an original gangster film that talks about robbery without showing it and whose action is essentially behind closed Doors in a hangar. Parades because of a limited budget, of course, but which make Reservoir Dogs totally brilliant and which imposes the style of its director, capable of launching crooks on discussions as innocuous as the meaning of ""Like a virgin"" or the importance of tips for waitresses. His universe, riddled with references manages to exist and to make a place for itself without acting as a pale copy. On the contrary, the proofreading of the references is skilful and sufficiently assumed for the pleasure to be there. Whether in the choice of dialogues, the actors (Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen and Tim Roth form a quartet of shock) or the violence (the ear scene is just cult), Tarantino seems to amuse himself and benefit its viewer, delivering the first centerpiece of a brilliant and enjoyable filmography."
Zeyders,"Oct 27, 2025",8/10,"The first of many films by Quentin Tarantino, which immediately won the hearts of many, including me. I watched it as a child, but now I've rewatched it as an adult, and maybe it's not as good for me now, but it's still a good film.The plot moves quickly and is interesting. The dialogue is engaging with good jokes. The characters are memorable with their distinct personalities. There are several interesting cinematographic techniques.It's hard to say what's wrong with this film. Some people may not like the premise of the film and may have expected something different. Some people may not find the dialogue interesting and may find the events absurd.For me, this is one of Quentin Tarantino's best films, especially as a debut film."

Shilo_R_A,"Jun 15, 2021",8/10,"My first Tarantino film IS the first Tarantino film! How apropriate.Anyway, Reservoir Dogs is the directorial debut of one of the most famous directors out there - Quentin Tarantino. It tells the story of a bank heist gone wrong, backwards - I mean, the film starts after the bank heist, and we follow the characters as they try to understand what really happened, thinking that some team member sold them out. We learn what happend and about each character through flashbacks and dialogue, mainly.So, gotta tell ya, I get why this film is so iconic. This film is pretty fast-paced, so it just grabs you in and throws you from one iconic scene to another. The dialogue is so natural, and its flow is truly great. Each main character is so well-written too, and memorable in its own unique way. The acting is mostly solid - Mr Orange, Mr Pink and Mr White are quite legendary acting-wise. Eddie is the only one whose acting fell a little short for me from time to time, but it was decent most of the film. I love the structure, too - it may sound weird on paper, but it works so incredibly well here.The soundtrack is really on point as well, and I honestly think that this is one hell of a debut film.I mean...damn, it's only his first film and it's that good! Definitely looking forward to watch more of his stuff.Feeling an 8.9 on this one. Probably will grow on me with time, but that's for now. Highly recommended.P.s
I think that the symbolism that each color had here (I mean, the names of the characters). Pretty cool, Tarantino. Pretty cool."
lukem-52760,"Aug 10, 2019",8/10,"RESERVOIR DOGS was always my favourite of Tarantino's films growing up in the 90's, most people loved ""Pulp fiction"" the best, yes it's also BRILLIANT but i like the simplicity of his masterpiece Debut movie & his brilliant ""Jackie Brown"" infact it's his 90's films that completely gripped me into the world of Tarantino!!! My love has grown more now for the smart & intriguing storytelling & characters of his underrated Jackie Brown but his low-budget Cracking Crime Thriller RESERVOIR DOGS will always be my favourite Tarantino movie & one of my favourite movies ever!!!! His little Heist Flick is a memorable, iconic & extraordinary piece of filmmaking & one that i hold close to my movie loving heart.
I absolutely love his ""90s Trilogy"" as i call it as each film was outstanding, Reservoir dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown, what a set of films by probably the greatest director of all time!!!Anyway back to the dogs,
I love the ""set in one place"" situation such as the meeting place warehouse where all the intense drama happens after the robbery has gone wrong.TARANTINO shows how great he is from the beginning scene in the Cafe with the crew of criminals chatting & having Coffee together, here the witty & fun dialogue shines right through, it's funny & smart & so different from any other movie as this is a Tarantino movie & it's already unique.I grew up in the 90's & Tarantino was the Coolest Director out there, his films were all hit instant CLASSIC's such as Reservoir Dogs, Pulp Fiction & Jackie Brown plus From Dusk Till Dawn that he didn't direct but was a main star in it as well as producing it & he had written it, so Tarantino was huge.
Reservoir dogs remains a tight, intense & powerful Crime Thriller before Tarantino got longer & more talkative with his films, this remains a simple story that's not too long but is filled with Cool characters & excellent performances!!!
Reservoir dogs is a blood soaked masterpiece of Neo noir Crime & great story telling.This is probably still my favourite Tarantino film, I'm huge fan of his work as he is truly a genius but hey each film he crafts is excellent!!!I could watch this movie over & over again it's that great & smart, Reservoir dogs is such a Nostalgic 90's CLASSIC & for a debut film it's pretty much a MASTERPIECE.
I feel a connection with the genius Tarantino as i love movies like he does, i understand that obsession & I'm a movie geek too & i feel much safer in my movie world than i do in the horrible real world, the film world makes sense to me but not reality!!!
The 90's were the best for Tarantino though in my opinion as i have big Nostalgia for his first 3 films. A funny & compelling little low-key Genre film that is basically a cheap B-movie but crafted like a ""big"" movie thanks to the genius of Tarantino."
ak-15621,"Aug 26, 2021",6/10,Not perfectly written. The writer is supposed to tell story perfectly and in order. The main thing the heist on which the movie is based on was never shown in the whole movie.
baumhenrik,"Sep 30, 2019",10/10,"This movie proofs it. Tarantino became employee of the month on his first day at work. He already had his unique way of designing scenes and dialogues from early on and created a masterpiece out of nowhere.
It was this unique style that captured me from the first minute I experienced it. The way characters were introduced and scenes were arranged was so different to everything I had seen at this point and the dialogues had such impact without being over acted. But not only the spoken word stands out in this movie also the pictures you see on the screen have a whole lot of impact. The way the camera is used has something I can't really explain but it makes every frame of this movie look like a cool poster in my opinion (something Tarantino kept up to this day imo).
Also the story is a hell of a ride and the order which the story is told in is just pure genius and could not be done any better in my opinion.
The puzzle gets resolved more the further you look and collapses in a bangin End.
This movie catapulted Tarantino into my personal Mt Rushmore of Movie Directors and to this day he held his spot."
Doylenf,"Feb 18, 2007",7/10,"It took me fifteen years to get around to viewing RESERVOIR DOGS and my interest was piqued only because I've come to admire HARVEY KEITEL as an actor. And I might as well admit, I'm not a fan of Quentin Tarantino either, although I love a good crime film. This one has to do with tough gang members talking about the aftermath of a crime, where one of them is seriously wounded and they suspect someone has infiltrated their mob and tipped off the police.""Did you kill anybody?""""Three cops. No real people, just cops.""The brutal torture scene was a little too intense for me. But the story, about the cop inserting himself into the mob, is well handled throughout, building tension from scene to scene even though the flashbacks are not in chronological order.Standout performances from the entire cast: HARVEY KEITEL, TIM ROTH, MICHAEL MADSEN, CHRIS PENN, QUENTIN Tarantino and LAWRENCE TIERNEY (almost unrecognizable as the Lawerence Tierney of ""Dillinger"" and other '40s crime films).Warning: As usual with Tarantino, the graphic violence is a bit much with lots of kicking, stabbing, blood gushing moments--and the torture scene of a young cop is almost unwatchable in its intensity and cruelty.But all in all, a powerful film of its kind with a ""crime doesn't pay"" morality tacked onto the brutal ending. If only Tarantino could tell his tales with a little more finesse--but then, he wouldn't be Tarantino, would he?Warning: Not for children. Too intense, too graphic.Seen now, it's almost a forerunner of Martin Scorsese's THE DEPARTED with the same gangster brutality and the dialog peppered with profanity in practically every other word."
fubar-2,"Oct 23, 1998",1/10,"This repulsive, reprehensible trash for Quentin Tarantino has to rank as one of the worst movies ever made.  When I wasn't bored to tears by interminable dialogue, I was repulsed by the glorification of sadism as an alternative life-style.  The Marquis De Sade would have been proud.  Tarantino should put his talents to suitable use and just make a real 'snuff' film.  See 'Clockwork Orange' instead.  That is a work of real genius."
Scramtrix2548,"Sep 23, 2025",8/10,"In this movie Tarantino, made with a low budget a really good movie to start his career. This is a really good crime movie full of suspense and it speak about the succession of event that lead to the situation of when the movie beginning. In my opinion is in the top 10 of movie about a robbery. I definitely recommend it to a fan of Tarantino or an appassionate about the crime."
dansandiford-223-179331,"Nov 1, 2020",10/10,"Probably the cleanest, leanest writing I ever heard. Being relatively low on action, but highly descriptive, a play was my natural inclination.
Informed and intelligent dialogue became Tarantino's trademark."
grantss,"Apr 19, 2014",10/10,"A crime boss assembles a team of six experienced criminals to pull off a large jewellery heist. However, it goes badly and the team are ambushed by police. The survivors regroup at an abandoned warehouse where it becomes obvious to them that someone in the team is an undercover cop. But which one?Brilliant crime-drama. With a meagre budget, Quentin Tarantino made a masterpiece. Have watched Reservoir Dogs five or six times now and it never gets old or loses its impact, despite knowing how it's going to turn out. If anything, it gets better with each watching, as I spot little things I didn't see the previous times.All the Tarantino trademarks are there: the witty dialogue, gritty characters, graphic violence, elaborate and detailed - yet watertight - plot, the character development, the backwards-and-forwards-in-time effects, the excellent, well selected soundtrack.Tarantino's work behind the camera is the sort of magic that gets examined in film schools. The low budget probably helped - when you don't have special effects and all other expensive means at your disposal, you need to maximize the effect of what you have. Certainly the greatest ever directorial debut (if it is regarded as Tarantino's debut).Casting was spot on, and every actor plays out of his skin. Nothing seems forced, and the characters gel perfectly - you wouldn't even know anyone was acting.Considering the perfection of this movie, it is quite amazing that Tarantino managed to surpass it with his next movie, making the greatest movie of all time: Pulp Fiction."
alibrahim1,"Aug 24, 2023",8/10,"Extremely fun and enjoyable movie. Fast paced yet informative in some way with all the flashbacks. Also you feel a sense of discomfort and urgency the whole movie because of the injured man (Mr. Orange). He is hurt dying and drenched in blood the whole movie, yet you know in your mind as a viewer than he can be helped.There isn't much to the story it's very simple. No complexity. Could have added more suspense but as a rather short movie it's perfect. Bloody, full of violence, tension between the characters but extremely fun with the dark humor.Amazing directing and shot by Tarantino especially the cuts where he explained every character yet doesn't confuse you. Flows perfectly and structured in a non confusing way.Great watch for it being Tarantino's first directional movie!"

AlgisKuliukas,"Mar 17, 2002",6/10,"Ok, Tarrantino's films are exceptionally well made. This one too. But I have to say I didn't like it very much.Like Pulp Fiction this film has some wonderful dialog. It was the promise of that, that attracted me to it in the first place. (So, clearly I saw this second.) However, unlike Pulp Fiction, you are not left with warm and uplifting memories of delightful, witty conversations at the end, instead the movie leaves you depressed and feeling sick at having just witnessed humanity pretty close to its worst. The unnecessarily vicious scenes of violence and endless ranting of angry men screaming at each other are what you take away from this film.If that's your idea of a good night out, you'll watch this and enjoy it. For me it was too bleak, too depressing. There was just not enough positive stuff to outweigh the negative.I loved Pulp Fiction but this was just too bloody horrible to be enjoyable for meAlgis Kuliukas"
fernandoschiavi,"Mar 4, 2023",8/10,"In 1992, with all the limitations that a low budget brings to a production, he releases his first film: Reservoir Dogs. The feature film - written, directed by and starring Tarantino - tells the story of a group of six crooks - Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker) and Mr. Brown (Tarantino) - who plans and executes a robbery, but does not know that among its members there is an undercover police officer.Tarantino had already written the good scripts for ""Love at the Burn"", released in 1993, but previously sold to filmmaker Tony Scott, and for ""Natural Born Killers (1994)"" when producer Lawrence Bender decided to take over the ""Dogs of Rent"" alongside actor and co-producer Harvey Keitel, who was very impressed with the characters created by the former clerk at Video Archives. Many will roll their eyes at the use of the term ""originality"" in Tarantino's theatrical debut, as the director notoriously draws more than inspiration from previous cinematographic works, with ""Reservoir Dogs"" being, among others, heavily rooted in the excellent ""The Killing"", by none other than Stanley Kubrick and in the fun "" Lung foo fung wan"", by Ringo Lam. However, this eye roll is not only snobbish, but also unfair, as the director has never hidden his influences and has always known, since this beginning here, to employ his characteristic vision for each of his creations.Incidentally, this feature of the director is discreetly present in the superb preamble of Reservoir Dogs, in which, with several slow and circular shots, we are organically introduced to the entire cast in a characteristic US diner in which they chat about pleasantries just before the robbery. To a diamond shop, something we only found out later. Among the subjects, there are two reinterpretations of songs, or rather, a reinterpretation and a clarification. Madonna's Like a Virgin is explained by Mr. Brown (Tarantino) not as a puerile love story, but as a woman who meets a very well-endowed man who makes her feel like a virgin when they have sex. Then, ""Nice Guy"" Eddie Cabot (Chris Penn), one of the masterminds of the crime, reveals that, when he recently listened to the radio program K-Billy Super Sounds of the 70s (which accompanies the entire tape with narration by Steven Wright) , he discovered that, in The Night the Lights Went Out in Georgia, it is the singer who shot Andy, much to everyone's surprise. Tarantino seems to me very clearly warning that his work is exactly that: reinterpretation and clarification of classics.In a brilliant ellipse - thanks to the editing work of the director's partner, Sally Menke, who would accompany him until ""Inglourious Basterds"", passing away the following year - we are taken directly to the outcome of the more than failed robbery attempt, with Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), bleeding liters in the back seat of a car driven by Mr. White (Harvey Keitel) and that's where the story effectively begins, with the characteristic non-linear montage of Tarantino and Menke taking the film by storm, which allows returns to different past moments of the characters, including the robbery itself, which even so we never really see. Orange and White, due to the circumstances, establish closer ties, including revealing their respective real names, a basic ban on all planning. That connection is broken with the entry of the paranoid Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) in the warehouse that is the hangout of the ""Dogs"", who immediately begins to wonder about a traitor among them. Further ahead, it's the turn of the psychotic Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), who has a policeman hostage in to whom he begins to take out all his frustration and sadism.The growing imbalance and distrust in a confined space - the present action is all in the warehouse, something Tarantino would do again in an even more incredible way in ""The Hateful Eight"" - is the great highlight of the work, with the director extracting the best of each of its cast, with special emphasis on Roth, who does 100% of his work (in the present) lying and bleeding and Keitel, a well of sanity (something he would repeat as Mr. Wolf, in Pulp Fiction) between spirits completely contaminated by anger, desire for revenge and enmity. The warehouse of funeral coffins (note the decoration in the background) is the proverbial pressure cooker that the spectator knows will end up exploding one way or another, in a phenomenal job of building tension that is astonishing for its simplicity of execution, something seen even in the basic costumes - black suits - of each character.Another key factor here is Tarantino's almost unrivaled ability to curate songs for his films, and the casting for Reservoir Dogs is where it all began. If the highlight goes to Stuck in the Middle With You, a song that today is inseparable from acts of sadism, especially those related to ears, it is impressive to see how the director - who, according to legend, plays the songs on the set of footage to get everyone in the mood - he manages to dot in snippets from Little Green Bag, Magic Carpet Ride, Hooked on a Feeling and others in such a way that each song seems to have been composed for his handiwork.With few sets and locations, the director works his script in order to bring dynamism to each scene, something that became his trademark from then on. There are the main pillars of his cinematographic style: references to pop culture, stylized violence, a great direction of actors. Everything is already noticed in the opening scene, when in a conversation about the song ""Like a Virgin"", the work introduces us to all the characters that we will follow for the next hour and forty minutes. The choice to draw a non-linear narrative is another differential. Skipping scenes and events, the feature ends up being a robbery movie that is not necessarily concerned with showing the act itself, but its consequences. The tension between the characters grows naturally and the events have a very irreverent comic realism.We still cannot fail to mention the verbose dialogues (with the absolute performance of actors Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn in this regard), and sometimes cruel when dealing with delicate themes of the American puritanical society, such as racism, sexism, drug consumption, criminality and extreme violence. In addition, he launched symbolic elements that extend throughout his career from erudite cinephile bows, quotes to an extensive B-movie cinematography, and various references to pop culture, ranging from music (discussion of Like a Virgin, by Madonna) to TV (series Get Christie Love). Tarantino also elaborated a striking aesthetic repertoire, which transits between the seventy's aura, the gangster underworld, the white trash of the American lower-middle class, the Yankee kitsch, the diverse exploited and a lively gringo horror show that, invariably, ends in a bloodbath.Quite simply, the story - a robbery, which goes wrong, at a jewelry store, a situation whose tension increases due to the suspicion of the presence of a police informant within the group of robbers - has certain gaps filled in by means of flashbacks, which, however, are not inserted in a merely didactic way. Tarantino individualizes the characters through a structure formed by chapters in which each one gains certain prominence. The characters, however, have their identities duly hidden (they are identified by color, in order to avoid that some pass data on the others, if they are captured). Despite this impersonal designation, emotional bonds eventually develop between them, as between Mr. Orange-Freddy and Mr. White-Larry (Harvey Keitel), in that film played by a finely tuned male cast.In any case, the relationships are brutal, judging by the violence depicted on the screen. The contrast between the lightness of the soundtrack and sequences full of blood accentuates the perversion of some characters. The images of the tortured police officer, Marvin Nash (Kirk Baltz), and the shot member of the gang, bleeding incessantly, suggest that Tarantino seeks to value the extremes of the body - the extremes of pain -, a perspective highlighted at the moment when both, already almost without strength, they talk. This approach to the body connects Reservoir Dogs to the director's future achievements, mainly to the Kill Bill project (2003/2004). There is also a discreet link with Jackie Brown (1997) through the mention of Pam Grier and the issue of racism, constantly highlighted in the characters' prejudiced comments. Concise, rigorous, irreverent and disconcerting, Reservoir Dogs mobilized a cinephile generation in the early 1990s. The film fully survives the passage of time.""Reservoir Dogs"" is the amalgamation of the Tarantino style of filmmaking, something that many mistakenly claim to be nothing more than copying someone else's work, not realizing that this style became the basis for which crime and crime films of the following decades began to crave and be compared. The director establishes his school here, already in his debut, and, from there, he would move between genres with almost unscathed mastery. Not every debut work has this merit. Here in his first work, Tarantino exudes confidence with assured direction, using elegant camera transitions and a great soundtrack to establish his narrative. Even when we are faced with scenes of visceral violence, the director manages to soften them by employing a certain humor that brings identity to the film. It's not hard to say that in his first film Quentin Tarantino was already a complete screenwriter and director. Since then, he has only improved his technique. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is daring, fun, innovative. A young classic of cinema that ages better and better within the filmography of one of the greatest filmmakers the world has ever known."
Cinemayo,"Jul 3, 2004",6/10,"This is Quentin Tarantino's first movie -- a really down and dirty, realistic affair about gangsters and what can occur when they screw up a jewel heist. It starts out great (I liked those early diner discussions about tipping and the point behind Madonna's ""Like A Virgin""), and the torture sequence featuring Michael Madsen is disturbing and very effective. But there isn't much of a plot to all of the goings on, and the bulk of this picture consists of a lot of aimless cursing and yelling. I tend to think of the excellent PULP FICTION when discussing Quentin's other movies, as that was the first of his films I'd seen, and I fell in love with it...a real work of art, that movie. So after going back and discovering DOGS, it becomes apparent that Tarantino rehashed some of this for FICTION. Maybe ""fine tuned"" a few things. This is evident with moments like the aforementioned discussion and philosophies in the diner. And Tarantino's obviously fond of working with the same actors again and again.RESERVOIR DOGS is an occasionally interesting yet pointless start for the video clerk geek turned director, but he was to really improve and hone his craft with future movies like PULP FICTION and KILL BILL. **1/2 out of ****"
N667,"Nov 5, 2003",3/10,"Quentin Tarantino seems to concentrate his movies very much along the lines of ""cool"" and ""tough"" and pulpy storylines and characters. To me, his scripts come across as done by someone who reads too many B-grade comic books, mainly because his movies have very similar content.The story is very thin, and to sum up the what you see on the screen most of the time: there's a bunch of cookie-cutter emotionally retarded tough-guys who compete over who can deliver the coolest and toughest lines to each other and wave their shiny guns at each other with the right sort of swagger. That sort of thing is just so ho-hum, clichéd, and juvenile that I felt like tuning out right away.Mixed into this macho posturing is some gratuitious violence (even to the point of being repulsive at times, for example when Mr. Blonde gets his way with the cop) and a couple of ""cool"" stories in the vein of Pulp Fiction's story about McDonald's in France (what depth). Too bad it's pretty much gloss over content. The only flash of intelligence in this movie is right at the beginning where Mr. Pink delivers his speech on tipping. That's what kept me somewhat interested at first. Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there.This sort of movie doesn't appeal to me at all, although I'm sure it has some appeal to teenagers who consider the like of _The Fast and the Furious_ to be ""cool"". Me, I guess I'm just too old (27) to be impressed by this sort of trashy stuff. Had I seen it ten years ago, my review then might have been somewhat different."
josepaulo-72710,"Jun 5, 2021",9/10,"So, the in the first scene we have a dialogue where Tarantino explains his view on '' Like a virgin'' by Madonna and i really was into it. With an amazing style and compeling dialogues this picture catched my attention every second. What shows why this movie is so good is the fact that this is probably my favorite heist movie without showing any actual heist.Incredible. Just incredible.This movie also shows us the background of three characters by flashback which are all amazingly done and so necessary for this movie.I gotta admit this was the first Tarantino movie that I cried, the last scene was just too much....Thank you Tarantino, you're the G.

Tomsdoingstuff,"Aug 28, 2019",10/10,"It's the original Tarantino masterpiece in which events happen in a nonlinear timeline and overall it adds to the story by letting us know what happens and later on explaining how it happened while showing what happens after. It's quite something and I love it. It's the one where the legendary Diamond heist takes place and all the iconic colorful characters are introduced like Mr.Blonde,Mr. Orange. It's filled with iconic scenes,characters and their interactions between each other, music in the right places to enhance the expierience of whatever happens perfectly and you can never forget the K-Billy's super sounds of the 70s playing in the background in important moments. It just has everything needed for a great movie. It's still very enjoyable after all these years.It's the original time capsule for anyone who wants to go back to the early days to understand Tarantino better and watch how it all began and evolved over time.Would 100% reccomend to anyone familiar or not with Tarantinos work."

EmperorOfIceCream,"Jan 12, 2010",9/10,"From first impression, this film appears to be slow, difficult to follow, and completely random. However, 20 minutes into the movie you will find yourself glued to the television. Being Tarantino's first film, it's not his best but it is still excellent! It operates how you would expect a Tarantino film to do so - in a seemingly unclear, incredibly violent and dialogue-driven manner. However, just like most of his other films, the plot soon becomes evident as the action shifts between characters and time (yes, the film is not sequential, so this may not be the film for you if you have a tough time following these types of movies). If you enjoy movies that really make you think and question some things you believe, especially reality, then this is the movie for you! Tarantino presents a gripping plot that is as real as it gets - this is not your typical Hollywood-ruined crime film. This is reality (or at least, Tarantino's reality).The performance of Madsen as Mr. Blonde / Vic Vega is amazing! I don't believe that the role of this character could have been cast any better. Madsen will remind you of Al Pacino's Scarface with his attitude, and his acting is impressive. Tim Roth also offers an unforgettable performance as Mr. Orange - an incredibly deep character whose story is the most interesting out of all the others. Likewise, Harvey Keitel takes the film to a whole other level with his emotion as Mr. White, especially through his relationship with Mr. Orange and his actions at the end of the film. The ONLY thing I DISLIKED about the film was Tarantino's acting performance, which I found to be completely unnecessary, below-average and awkward (thank God he doesn't play a major role in the film). I understand that it is a staple of his films, but he needs to provide performances like the appearance he did in Pulp Fiction if he wants anyone to like him.Otherwise, this film is a MUST-SEE and belongs higher on the IMDb top movies list!"
djbeardpaperclip,"Jan 30, 2025",7/10,"This was the film that established Tarantino. It combines the now familiar ingredients: snappy dialogue, elements of pop culture, extreme violence, and humour.A collection of villains are hand picked for a robbery. They use aliases and are briefed regarding their roles for a carefully planned operation. Through the use of flashbacks and dialogue the events are slowly revealed, from the planning to the crime which goes fatally wrong.Steve Buscemi and Harvey Keitel ultimately steal the show as Mr Pink and Mr White, but all the acting performances are strong in a film which sustains the suspense from start to finish."

MoANjAm,"Jan 26, 1999",1/10,"So highly hyped yet totally fails to live up to any of it this debut film is remembered for all the wrong reasons: that L.A gangsters are cool, ""That"" scene and Mr T's inability to write a script that conveys anger, emotion or suspense without resorting to F words.

baileyshaw99,"Sep 3, 2025",8/10,"Probably my favourite Tarantino film, really great dialogue, camera work, spectacular acting (Particularly from Madsen and Keitel) and the character writing is absolutely brilliant. Like most Tarantino films you just get thrown into the action and the story you're being told really gets revealed towards the end of the film but upon my first viewing I couldn't keep my focus on anything but the scene watching Mr White's (Harvey Keitel) interactions with other characters he speaks to every character in a totally different way and you can tell exactly how he feels and what he's thinking about the person he's talking to because you can compare to dialogue we've seen earlier on, really amazing writing and acting I have to say. I also love a good soundtrack and this one's got it. The highlight would have to be the Stuck In The Middle With You scene which If you don't already know about, you gotta watch this movie to see it. Overall Reservoir Dogs is a really good film that I regret waiting so long to watch. If you like Tarantino, Good dialogue or great crime films you'll love this one."

prudhoeboy,"Aug 27, 2021",8/10,"This movie is now as old as the Hitchcock films it imitated were when it was made in 1991. Though not really my cup of tea, the movie is much like the playhouse theater movies of the 1950s and early 60s with emphasis on dialogue and noir violence rather than taking you somewhere. Obviously low budget but that goes with the genre. The cop bashing seemed over the top to the point of pandering and I doubt any cop these days would sacrifice himself to bust some garden variety mobsters. The three way shooting scene at the end also seemed a bit hard to believe given that the the subject of the argument, an informant cop who took a bullet to the gut was about to die anyway. These issues notwithstanding, what was really missing from the movie was one more big ticket star. The trivia says Tarantino tried several times to get James Woods for the movie but his agent didn't pass on the offer to Woods given that it was below what he normally gets for a movie. That is too bad, because Woods wood have been perfect in this movie, say as the wounded police informant. This is the one thing that separates this movie from a Hitchcock classic - Hitchcock always got big stars for his movies to make sure they will be iconic films. I don't recommend this movie because of all the violence and bloodshed. But if you don't mind that, go ahead."
ThreeSadTigers,"May 11, 2008",N/A,"For me, there's too much emphasis placed on Tarantino's technique of cinematic self-reference and personal homage. Although it has become something of a defining characteristic of his work - even more-so since the release Kill Bill Vol. 1 (2003) - it is simply one single layer of a rich tapestry of elements that make his films so effective. When Reservoir Dogs (1992) was first released, the referential aspect was almost completely ignored. Instead, critics applauded Tarantino for his strong characters, clever dialog, use of violence and music; and the effortless use of structure and narrative, which helped to turn a seemingly pedestrian crime-thriller into an exciting and enigmatic exercise in cinematic tension building. Over the years, audience have noted the references to films such as City on Fire (1987), The Taking of Pelham One Two Three (1974) and The Killing (1956) (though Tarantino claims to be more influenced by the original novel, as opposed to the Kubrick film) and dismissed these references as simple theft. This is foolish though, and flies in the face of the very cannibalistic nature of film, and the idea that every single story, character and theme analysed in 20th century art can be traced back to a secondary source related centuries before.If you've seen enough films, then you can easily draw surface similarities from almost anything made subsequent to 1970. In fact, in a world in which comic book adaptations and ""foreign language"" remakes dominate the box-office; Tarantino's approach is truly defiant. If he were a musician, he'd most probably be a hip-hop producer - someone like RZA or Danger Mouse - taking ideas and samples from a variety of different works and blending it all together to produce something new and exciting. So the themes may be well worn, but the presentation and technique is electrifying. Think of that opening scene in particular; a seriously minded discussion of the textual-interpretations of Madonna's Like a Virgin and a debate on the ethics of tipping that not only sets the scene - quite literally - for the use of dialog to follow, but establishes the single characters and their personalities perfectly. We take it for granted now, but try to think of any other American crime film made prior to 1991 that manages to successfully appropriate a scene of pop-cultural discourse into the opening sequences of a tense and violent thriller. Then, look at how it moves seamlessly into the credit sequence; a moment of decade defining cool that some have seen as a nod to A Clockwork Orange (1971), though it really serves a far more functional means of further introducing this broad ensemble of characters, so as not to over-complicate the actual viewing of the film once we get into the telling of the story.There's then a flash-forward, introducing the idea of a fractured narrative. Again, we take it for granted, but think about it; any other heist film and the scene of the heist would dominate. Here, we don't even get to see it. As a result, the botched robbery and the violence that is described to us takes on a more enigmatic purpose, creating something of a Rashomon (1950) like conundrum in which we're forced to take these varying characters at their word, and - much like the protagonists of the film itself - draw our own conclusions and allegiances. By not showing the heist, Tarantino adds to the tension, not only between the characters on screen, but between the characters and the audience. It's a radical move on the part of the filmmaker; as jaw-dropping as making a film about the D-Day invasions without ever showing the soldiers hit Normandy. The film is also remarkable for the atmosphere that Tarantino creates - both in the way in which he stretches out shots and scenes beyond the point that most other filmmakers would, and of course, in his careful use of framing, minimal production design and the use of hand-held cinematography - all to establish a sense of urgency and unease that escalates as the plot goes backwards and forwards on itself. It's a definite pressure cooker-like environment being developed throughout, as each scene builds and builds and then cuts back in on itself; giving us more of the back-story and further reinforcing the bitter ironies of both the characters and that ending.It is also helped by the fine performances, with every member of the cast defining these characters, not simply as archetypes or conventional components of the narrative, but somewhat believable human beings. This quality is pushed further by the use of the fragmented narrative, as Tarantino presents the story almost like a jigsaw puzzle, with information held back from us until the right juncture in the narrative, at which point we can finally put all of the pieces into place and then stand back to appreciate the view. Without question, Reservoir Dogs is a tense, coolly ironic thriller that not only subverts the usual codes and conventions you would expect to find in a heist thriller, but does so in such a way as to remain light, effortless and greatly entertaining. Today it is synonymous with changing the landscape of mid-90's cinema; creating a brief resurgence of intelligent, character driven films that were quirky, self-aware and filed with that spirit of independence. However, before the hype and the greater success of Pulp Fiction (1994), it was simply a great film; one that presented a clever story, cinematic characters and an unconventional approach to on screen violence that reminded people that you could have more from cinema than a bland reproduction of a story."

khalidmoubile,"Sep 5, 2023",8/10,"Reservoir Dogs.When a simple jewelry heist goes horribly wrong, the surviving criminals begin to suspect that one of them is a police informant.Well, this film is considered as Tarantino's debut and that is mind-blowing, I mean how this guy had his own style since day one, we don't get to watch such as movies, his pattern of directing is really too good for me, I can't say enough about this guy really .Reservoir dogs is a crime movie about a gang that suspects one of its member to be a rat, we've seen this quite a lot but the vibe here was different, the yelling and the chemistry were at a different level , Mr white and Mr blond were definitely my favorites and everyone else was great actually.The ending was kind of iconic, a memorable one.I watched this right after pulp fiction, I think I'm addicted guys."
B8MAN,"Sep 23, 2025",6/10,"The whole movie left me sort of unsatisfied. Not only the ending.If you're down for some cool guys having quirky guy conversations and it being packaged in a movie with interesting storytelling, filming and music, this might be for you. I just liked the randomness of some of the conversations, but it didn't make Reservoir Dogs into a good movie."
TheManInOil,"Jan 23, 2002",2/10,"I can only imagine that those who like this film find appeal in the violence.  It certainly isn't in the direction or story-telling.  It's an incredibly badly-written and episodic piece, full of irrelevant scenes without which it would only be an hour long.  What is relevant makes no use of the medium.  Characters are not introduced through telling actions, but by introducing themselves in some kind of criminal job-interview. Tarantino's 'genius' seems to be a habit of having the lowest sort of people engaged in violent pursuits converse as casually as ladies at tea.  It's a trick he uses and re-uses in all his films.  Maybe Reservoir Dogs was meant to have deconstructionist elements a la From Dusk Till Dawn, but I think it's just what it appears to be:  a really bad film.William Bell"
filipemanuelneto,"May 28, 2020",9/10,"I will start this review by making a warning that I give whenever I dedicate myself to a film directed by Quentin Tarantino: I am not an admirer of this director. On the contrary. I'm even quite critical about his work. Not even Jesus Christ pleased everyone, did He? However, from this filmmaker's long list of works, this film is one of the ones I liked the most, I must confess.The film is based on the failed attempt to rob a jeweler, in order to steal a load of diamonds. The gang is highly professional and was hired by a boss who is superior to everyone. The degree of professionalism and commitment of the thieves reaches the point of not even knowing each other's names, using only nicknames created for the purpose. However, the failure revealed that one of the elements is actually a police informant. What remains is to find out which of the surviving elements is that informer.Some say that this film is very violent. I honestly don't agree. There are a lot of films out there that manage to be much harder to see than this, and I am thinking, for example of the long lists of horror gore (""Hostel"", ""Saw""). In any case, it is a movie for adults, in which Tarantino shows that he is very good when he does not sacrifice everything that makes a film work in favor of the look, style and technique. Superbly done and well written, it tells a story with logic and coherence.The cast is excellent, and combines several big names like Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney and Tarantino himself. I would personally highlight the performances of Keitel, Buscemi, Roth and, above all, Tierney for their quality. Technically, it is a discreet film, which almost clashes if we look at Tarantino's stylized and very visual films. Perhaps this is due to the mere fact that this film was the first major work in the director's career. Cheap to produce, as befits a film made outside the big studios, everything takes place in a restricted group of scenarios and there are few exterior scenes or effects, being a film based on dialogues and the interpersonal relationships of the various characters. Even the blood looked fake, actually.This film is proof that it is not necessary to abuse stylization in cinema to make good films. Just having good actors, knowing how to direct them and telling a good story."
cagebox111,"Jun 3, 2021",10/10,"Tarantino's first, and best, movie is also his simplest. A heist gone bad, Reservoir Dogs relies on slick writing and stellar acting to deliver an utterly original and memorable experience. Quick, clever, and brutal, in Reservoir Dogs Tarantino has crafted a nearly perfect movie."
sasha-00416,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"Everything is brilliant in this film: actors, music, dialogues, atmosphere... because in one word - it's TARANTINO🔥
And although few people could imagine that the debut film of a former video rental employee could somehow surprise...BUT he didn't just surprise, he divided cinema into BEFORE and AFTER!Therefore, I advise you to watch this picture, because Quentin Tarantino's films are the best crime films of our time. This film was the beginning of the cinematic career of Tarantino and many actors who are world cinema giants today.Look where it all started😏"
aigoalies,"Aug 17, 2020",9/10,The plot of this movie isn't that exciting or action packed but the story comes together in an excellent way with tons of amazing acting and excellent scenes that make it an instant classic along with some amazing dark humor. The only thing that brings this movie down is Quentin Tarantino who looks very out of place and the fact that the pacing was a little bit slow at times. Other than those two criticisms this movie was very good in my opinion.
Luisgtz11,"Sep 23, 2025",8/10,"I don't know how I slept on this movie for so long, but Reservoir Dogs absolutely blew me away. It's tense, engaging, and works like a small-scale thriller with huge impact. The mystery of figuring out who the mole is keeps you hooked, but it's the dialogue that makes it unforgettable.Quentin Tarantino's writing and direction are just on another level here. You can tell why this debut cemented him as one of the best writer-directors of all time. The way he blends humor, tension, and violence into pure cinematic energy is just stupendous."
bradyjones716,"Apr 13, 2021",9/10,"Quinton Terrentino yet again proves that he is one of the best writers and directors in the game.I can not go on about this movie enough. I've seen amazing movies. The Departed, Zodiac, Goodfellas, 7even. This movie stands up there with them in that it was just amazingly written. Amazingly well screened. And amazingly well casted. If you are looking for a movie that is gangster. Crime-filled. Action-packed. And just overall ball-kicking amazing. This is the movie for you. A couple of things that took it a part from the rest is that the scenes were all very thought out and drawn out. Each scene ranged from 6 minutes to even 15 minutes. I watched this movie very late so I was tired. But even still I was drawn to the screen every second of it.The acting was absolutely impeccable. Every line was said without a stutter and showed you exactly what was going on in a crime gangster way. The language was a lot but very expected and well thought out in the moments. It fitted the situation very well which made it not stand out. There are a lot of movies out there that overdo the swearing a lot just to make it darker, which doesn't work a lot of the time. But this movie made it fit in well enough that you didn't even notice as much.The whole movie was filled with a tension and release method which made you drawn to the screen a lot like I said before. There were no scenes in the movie that didn't need to be there which made it enjoyable and easy to watch comfortably.I rated this movie a 10/10 and I will stand with that rating until I hit my grave. This is a ""must watch"""
Mr. Film,"May 19, 1999",5/10,"Many people believe ""Reservoir Dogs"" is a good film. It is not. Tarantino failed to make it into anything but violence and the combination of music and camera-work. The screenplay was poor, but the lines, or at least the way they were written, were convincing. This film has absolutely no redeeming qualities, and I use the word ""redeeming"" loosely about movies. Without a doubt, many movies are about nothing and are good. ""Dogs"" is about a group of men who messed up a bank robbery and went to a warehouse to talk about things and get very angry at each other.Many find the movie hip, but at best the movie itself is not hip, the pitiful characters may seem to be, but really the only hip character is Mr. White, played by Harvey Keitel. Anyone that thinks supposed professionals who can't do their jobs right, swear a great deal over nothing, get very tense, and lose their cool on a dime work well for a movie centered around nothing in particular are wrong. A very weak film."
dimitrisalomao,"Mar 23, 2010",10/10,"I don't know if this movie is worth a 100%, but the fact that I had the courage to give it a 100%, shows that this movie is something more than great, it's a masterpiece, and although I think it's not as good as ""Pulp Fiction"", it's almost there.Six criminals, who are strangers to each other, are hired by a crime boss Joe Cabot to carry out a diamond robbery. Right at the outset, they are given false names with an intention that they won't get too close and concentrate on the job instead. They are completely sure that the robbery is going to be a success. But when the police show up right at the time and the site of the robbery, panic spreads among the group members and one of them is killed in the subsequent shootout along with a few policemen and civilians. When the remaining people assemble at the premeditated meeting point (A warehouse), they begin to suspect that one of them is an undercover cop.Quentin Tarantino, which is one of the finest directors of all time, impressed me more as a writer than as a director in this movie. Right in its first scenes, we can see how well made the screenplay is, the conversation about ""Like A Virgin"", and about tipping are priceless (He really convinced me that I should only tip when the waitress really deserves it). The dialogue is incredibly funny and unusual, that in it's first film, Tarantino defined his own genre. Some dialogues are so original, like when Mr. Pink (Buscemi) asks Mr. White (Keitel) about Mr. Orange (Roth), ""Is it bad?"", and Mr. White answers, ""As opposed to good?"". Or when Mr. Pink asks Mr. White if he killed any real people, and he answers, ""No, just cops."". Or the classic ""Are you gonna bark all day, little doggy? Or you're gonna bite?"".The acting is really great too, Keitel makes a tough, but sensitive Mr. White, Buscemi makes a Mr. Pink that only cares about getting out of there without going to jail, not carrying about the others, and Michael Madsen does a charismatic psycho, and sadistic Mr. Blonde, that doesn't care about anything. It's hard to talk about the other actors, without giving any spoilers, so I'm not gonna do it, although they all deserve highlights.Verdict: If you are a Tarantino fan, you'll idolize this movie, and even if you don't like this director, you'll recognize this is a masterpiece."
nakeane09,"Aug 25, 2002",9/10,"this movie was terrible.  the first 35min are nothing but horriflying boring dialogue that would only seem interesting to those on crack.  Tarantino should be put to shame for writing/directing/starring in this movie.  I watched this because my friend and i throughly enjoyed taritinos pulp fiction, which is now one of my all time favorites.  But dont let this trick you.  This movie has 7min of action, which still sucks.  I would have to come up with a new set of words to describe the terror/horribleness/lame-ness put to the screen in reservoir dogs.  I give this film 1/10 becuase pulp ficion was awesome! PLEASE DONT SEE THIS MOVIE, AS WE SPEAK, I AM ON MY WAY TO BLOCKBUSTER TO GET MY MONEY BACK!"
baumer,"May 15, 2000",10/10,"I consider myself to be a film buff, a lover of the cinema, maybe even an addict.  I will see a film because it is a film.  For example, I knew I was going to hate the Virgin Suicides and I saw it anyway.  I have heard nothing positive of Battlefield Earth and I am heading there after this review is completed.  And on this logic alone I rented Reservoir Dogs for the first time in 1993.  I had heard of a new man on the scene that apparently was the talk of Hollywood.  I had also heard that there were some pretty interesting actors in the film and I had heard that Harvey Keitel was the one responsible for getting the film started.  So I was intrigued to see what the fuss was over this film.  However, the first time I saw it I was rather impartial to it.  It's not that I didn't like it but I just thought it to be okay.  I didn't really get what all the fuss was about but I did have a hard time watching the torture scene.  So I put Reservoir Dogs away in my mind until Pulp Fiction came out.  Because by the time Pulp Fiction came out Tarantino had penned the story for a brilliant True Romance and for Natural Born Killers and he had a few hysterical cameos in films like Sleep With Me where he attacked famous films like Top Gun and what they really meant.After I was swept away with Pulp Fiction, I went back and watched Reservoir Dogs again and this time I saw something that I didn't or couldn't see before.  I can't really put my finger on what it is or why it is that I didn't see it's brilliance before but I just didn't.  But Reservoir Dogs has to be one of the best movies ever by a new comer.  Forget how it is directed because it's direction is fine, but what Reservoir Dogs has that is sheer brilliance is an ear for dialogue.  There is not one character in this film that doesn't have at least one insightful thing to say.  Even Tarantino gives himself some great dialogue with his take on Madonna's Like A Virgin, or his displeasure with his given name by Joe ( ""Mr. Brown sounds too much like Mr. Shit!).There are certain films that perhaps should be mandatory viewing at film school, Pulp Fiction and Reservoir Dogs should be two of them.  This is one of those films that if perhaps you didn't quite like or understand the first time around, you should see again.  It hits you like an epiphany the second time.  In Tarantino's world, people are never one dimensional.  They have things to say whether it is about tipping or the name of an actress, or the rants of Nice Guy Eddie talking about them having places all over of the place.  I would love to see Kevin Smith and Quentin Tarantino get together and write a film.  It would probably be the funniest yet most serious film that has ever been made and it would certainly be one of the most entertaining.Reservoir Dogs is a film that you can watch over and over again and never get tired of and you can always catch something that you never caught the last time.  This is truly one of the finest films ever made and if you haven't seen it in quite some time, do yourself a favour and rent it.  It is one of a kind.10 out of 10"
tr91,"Aug 10, 2013",N/A,"Reservior Dogs is a classic film and Quentin Tarantino is just an absolute genius.I really liked this film, it was gripping and suspenseful. Straight to the point and extremely well acted. A few of the scenes were very gruesome but they needed to be. Michael Madsen as Mr. Blonde was just crazy but my personal favourite in this film was Chris Penn who played Nice Guy Eddie Cabot, I found him to be hilarious. The story developed at a good pace even though it was mostly set in one place with just a few flashbacks.Overall this is well deserving of its place in the IMDb top 250 list, a classic film that everyone just has to see.9/10."
DunnDeeDaGreat,"Sep 29, 2002",9/10,"Reservoir Dogs is one of the greatest films to come out of the nineties. Quentin Taratino made a spalsh in Hollywood with this film about finding out who's a rat. Taratino effievtely used the Rashmon cinematic device and filled with violence, profanity and humor. All the lead actors give great performances. But the real Amercian bad ass is Micheal Madsen as Mr.Blonde. I love this movie."
Vinel_Season,"Feb 9, 2021",9/10,"I recently watched Reservoir Dogs. And i thought it was underrated. This movie is a masterpiece on all levels. Great acting, great story, great editing, and most of all a great script. This is my 2nd favorite Tarantino movie (my #1 is Django Unchained). I do think this movie is better than Pulp Fiction because I like the fact that it is one story that is graspable, while Pulp Fiction is multiple stories with no particular problem or villain. And I love that there is so many long takes. I love long takes. Tarantino's first movie was an unforgettable masterpiece."
Mr Parker,"Aug 9, 2005",9/10,"I revisited this film a couple of days ago and a couple of things struck me about it. This is one hell of a film to have as a calling card. For one, the cast that this movie has is enough to inspire serious jealousy. Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Laurence Tierney, Eddie Bunker, Chris Penn... hot damn! You really see just why everyone wanted to make a film just like this one after it was released. It's funny but the film is so derivative of other crime films that it becomes an entirely new animal. Tarantino delivers a film that is completely sure of itself and what it wants to be. Yeah, some people complain that it's a ripoff of other films that preceded it, namely Ringo Lam's ""City on Fire"" but still, the film has so many memorable moments and gobs of instantly quotable dialogue that it is undoubtedly a classic of independent cinema. Tarantino's acting in this film is thankfully subdued. Violence comes in sudden jolts and reminds you of what kind of people it is you are dealing with within the film. The music selection is inspired and he does a great job of establishing these characters through their words and actions, which is why this film is so great. You have to love the characters, even in the case of Mr. Blue (Eddie Bunker) who gets much less screen time than anyone else in the film.I would like to at least give a nod of special attention to all of the actors in this film. Every single one is a crucial piece to this puzzle and are all very believable in their roles. If I had to pick one scene that was my favorite, it'd be very difficult. Whether it's an outburst of sudden violence or a conversation across a coffee table, this film delivers in almost all aspects.There really isn't much more that I can say about the film that hasn't already been said. The film is a bit rough around the edges technically speaking but hey, it was the guy's first film and it was filmed on a pretty shoestring budget. Regardless, this is simply the kind of film that one wishes they'd have as a debut film.RATING: ****1/2 out of *****."
ted-73,"Oct 9, 2002",5/10,"I have to think that this movie is one of the reasons that so many young filmmakers today think you can build a movie around random violence and cursing to no particular end.  I can't believe I sat through it.  Check out ""Cry Danger"" for a sanity check..."
Special-K88,"Jan 6, 2003",N/A,"Inventive, volatile, pulse-pounding and totally off-the-wall crime caper spotlights a group of total strangers who are brought together to try and pull off the perfect crime. Unfortunately for all those involved things go terribly (and violently) wrong, leading them to believe that there's a traitor in their midst. Contains scenes so startling and violence so intense that it may repel you, but it's so crafty and vividly realized that you go along for the ride. In true Tarantino fashion it's well-cast, highly profane, bold and shockingly brutal, yet amusing and completely convincing in its graphic depiction. Whether or not this glamorizes violence is debatable, but an entertaining fare nonetheless that is definitely not for the squeamish. ***½"
gavin6942,"Aug 2, 2007",9/10,"A group of criminals are assembled to pull off a diamond heist, but something goes wrong and all heck breaks loose. To top it off, the ones who escape must face the facts: someone in the team was a rat. But who was it? And what do they do with the cop in the trunk?I think many people consider ""Pulp Fiction"" Tarantino's best film, and I would agree that it's a fine film. But ""Reservoir Dogs"" uses the same formula even earlier, with a tighter script and solid actors (without relying on heavyweights like Bruce Willis). And, I think it's safe to say, this one has created more of a cult following and generates more homages (the walking in unison scene, the cop torture scene, etc.).We definitely get Michael Madsen's best performance here, and a strong Steve Buscemi. Was Madsen good in ""Free Willy""? Sure, but this is his defining role that kept him popular for the next decade. Buscemi always shines, but again he stands out here like he's not allowed to do anywhere else (with the possible exception of ""Ghost World""). Chris Penn (science bless him) and Tim Roth also are wonderful.Tarantino knows how to incorporate music into his movies -- you have to give him that. Taking lost or forgotten songs and making them sound fresh and new. Stealers Wheel was already known for ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" long before Tarantino put it in his movie, but how many of us can now never hear it the same way again? Radio play of the song likely increased, and we're all picturing the same thing...We also see his strong dialog writing skills. This is Tarantino's best skill: dialog. Sometimes this hinders him (some think it dragged down the pace of ""Kill Bill Volume 2"", almost all agree that ""Death Proof"" was too dialog-heavy). But other times it's the driving force. ""Reservoir Dogs"" is largely memorable for it's conversations, such as the Madonna conversation and the tipping conversation. Madsen and Buscemi are very quotable (""Are you gonna bark all day little doggie, or are you gonna bite?""). ""Pulp Fiction"" steps this up a notch (the watch story, Royale with Cheese, Big Kahuna burger), but the foundation really rests on this movie.If you haven't seen this one, see it. As of this review, it is sitting at the 65th best movie of all time according to Internet Movie Database. I have no reason to deny it that ranking. It might be better, it might be worse -- but it's clearly a strong movie."
bondgirl-3,"Dec 18, 1999",10/10,"This is one of the best films of all time. Really good. The message of loyalty and betrayal and honor amongst thieves really comes through. It shows the caring side of human nature as well as the bad, more violent side. I thought it was seriously good stuff."
nmcgraw123,"Oct 11, 2014",9/10,"The master piece that is ""Reservoir Dogs"" is hands down one of the most underrated movies in history. The independent film was directed by Quentin Tarantino, the genius behind ""Pulp Fiction"", the ""Kill Bill"" series, and ""Django Unchained"". Running at an hour and a half, every minute is filled with blood, violence, and foul language. Three factors that would go on to define Tarantino as a director. The movie revolves around six strangers who come together to perform a heist on a diamond store. Unfortunately the heist goes bad and leads the six men to figure out who among them is an undercover police officer. The film has received many great reviews (IMDB=8.4 / Rotten Tomatoes=8.8) such as Empire magazine calling it the ""Greatest Independent Film ever made"". Since it was an independent movie it only managed to produce $2,812,029 in box office sales. This falls way below the amounts seen on the All-time Box office earnings list. This statistic is not surprising but it does prove that independent movies should be taken seriously and that box office revenue is not a suitable way to measure a films quality."
mynameisneo,"Feb 22, 2006",9/10,"Before watching this film i had no previous expectation on the genre nor the plot of the film. People occasionally spoke comments about it, mostly praising it, but other than that i was in the dark.My first reaction seeing the cover was that it would be another action movie. However, when i began to watch the film i was very interested as it began to hook me. The dialogue is brilliant. Simply superb. The only other film that matches this sort of witty, catchy and super cool dialogue is pulp fiction.The whole film is brilliant from start to finish, showing that multi million dollar explosions and car chases are no match for dynamic acting and excellent writing.As for the story, well, i wont ruin it, but it is simply brilliant.Tarintino shows off all the skills and tricks he wanted to show off all the years he dreamed of becoming an director.If you are passionate about films, you Must see this.The actors in this film do not get enough credit, nor does the genius behind the film, the director."
lastliberal,"Apr 7, 2007",8/10,"Mr. Pink: You kill anybody? Mr. White: A few cops. Mr. Pink: No real people? Mr. White: Just cops.This is probably the most succinct characterization of this movie. We are talking hardened criminals here that have no regard for cops. Killing them is a sport. This movie shows the criminal mind better than any other I have seen. It is raw and hard and bloody and violent. It is not full of shootout and special effects. It is pure and clean and focused on conversation that gives some insight into what a criminal goes through. The anxiety after a botched job becomes paranoia and suspicion. Yes, it is justified, but here you see it to the extreme.Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, and Steve Buscemi were a joy to watch even though I would have shot Mr. Pink at the first opportunity just to shut him up!"
wiitigoo,"Jul 28, 2016",6/10,"Not bad - especially for a debut film. But really not a convincing film for me. I did not find it very fascinating, and the dialogues were not masterful, but rather boring. I think Django Unchained is a better movie for example, but maybe I am just not that big of a Tarantino fan.The limited resources for this movie can clearly be seen. Cinematography is still pretty good. Acting Performance also pretty good. Nice to see Tarantino himself as an actor (did not even know he had done so) and Steve Buscemi is one of my all time favorite actors.Only reason why I think Tarantino is so appreciated, is because of his dialogues (something that does not attract me that much).Would give a this movie a 6.5 if at first sight. Certainly not bad, but just not that entertaining and a bit too much the middle form me."
jamminjillo8,"Dec 26, 2009",9/10,"I had started and stopped this film many times before actually sitting down and watching it all the way through. After sitting through it, I can't stop thinking about it.The film was composed beautifully. Instead of a simple plot line, it was broken up and rearranged making the audience work until the end. The music and character transitions were perfect.Tarantino did a great job making the characters true to the people portraying them. Mr. Pink, Mr. Blonde, and Mr. White could have not been more perfect to their characters. The sheer fact that I hated and loved the various characters almost to a point of them being real is a feat in it of itself.I felt that the profanity was a bit much and it may be necessary to the plot and emotions, but at times it was a bit overbearing.Overall though, I was very impressed by the rawness of the story and how developed all of the characters were. Amazing!"
thinker1691,"Apr 6, 2009",7/10,"Director Quentin Tarantino has an exceptional ability to create action films like this one called ""Reservoir Dogs."" It is sure to rank among his very best. The script and it's dramatic storyline throughout the entire movie is a visual compendium of 'Waiting for Godot' meets 'Slaughter on Tenth Avenue.' Anyone seeing it for the first time is in for a real treat. The story is of an experienced gangster who attempts to create the perfect crime. Its simple enough, collect seven of the most professional and trustworthy men in the business, assign them code names, tell them just enough about the crime to do their part, snatch the haul, then rendezvous in a warehouse after the job and split the take. The men selected are top of the line actors like Lawrence Tierney as the Boss Joe Cabot, Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and Chris Penn. Like the best laid plans, the unexpected was not included and therefor becomes the focus of a violent shouting match with guns. Between themselves, the heist should have worked, why it didn't has much to do with the body in the trunk (Kirk Baltz) and will have them at each other's throats trying to fathom the reason. The final segment of the film makes it the most exciting climax since the shootout of the Wild Bunch. With dramatic flair and an excellent, but violent dialog, this incredible film will become a Classic. ****"
Gunn,"Dec 2, 2001",1/10,"What is wrong with Quentin Tarantino? The guy thinks of nothing but vile, despicable violence. His worst piece of trash is Natural Born Killers, but piece of crap..Reservoir Dogs is really disgusting. But what is more disturbing than the film is how so many people revere it. What have we come to? This film made me gag and want to throw up. What possible message comes from a film such as this? All I can say is God help us!"
ExtremeCloseUp,"Jan 18, 2024",N/A,"Reservoir Dogs has an interesting structure. After the opening scene, which is mostly a few guys chatting about various subjects such as the importance of tipping or the meaning of Like A Virgin, we jump right into the action. Or, actually, we jump right after the action and we witness the ramification of a failed heist unfolding.All the main action takes place in one room, a recipe he would follow again with success in The Hateful Eight. However, the narrative is non-linear and flashbacks are used to present the characters, as we barely know anything about them.So, that's Tarantino's debut and he's already developed his artistic identity, the elements that characterise his work are here: excessive violence (the ear-cutting scene being the obvious highlight), dirty mouths, realism taking a step back in favour of over the top theatrics, paying homage to his cinematic idols, a rather simple plot but extremely stylish storytelling. And of course the dialogue being constantly on the spotlight. His dialogue is almost always random, but usually it doesn't matter. In this case, though, I didn't find it particularly engaging. Linked to the above, I didn't consider the flashbacks really successful either, they disrupted the flow and didn't give us that much of an insight about the characters considering how much time they took.I liked the ending, the diamonds ended up where they belonged.Great soundtrack, heavy on the '70s."
Nick-4065,"May 30, 2025",8/10,"The most fun you can have with ""Reservoir Dogs"" is watching how much the all star cast play off of each other in such a loose and low budget setting. Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink is probably the highlight of the movie, as he's the guy with absolutely no morals who will step on anybody's back if he can get away with it.The script isn't the best thing ever, but it's a solid drama. There's also not a ton of violence, but the violence that's in there is mostly driven by great performances by top tier actors. Harvey Keitel is great in this movie, up until the final scene where you question whether he is principled or just angry."
bigplatts,"Jun 26, 2011",9/10,"Quentin Tarantino's first movie before he gained fame with pulp fiction, reservoir dogs is about a gang of criminals hired to do a simple robbery.The story is told in out of order scenes that show the events leading up to the heist and the things that happen after. The characters use colours instead of names so no one can rat them to the cops, and the entire cast give career-top performances. Harvey Keitel takes the lead as Mr.White and is in my opinion the best performance of his career, Tim Roth plays Mr.Orange in one of his earliest roles, playing the young member of the crew doing one of his first jobs. While Micheal Madsen plays the psycho Mr.Blonde in another top role. Other performances include Chris Penn and Tarantino himself.The story moves a lot quicker than other Tarantino work, while keeping all of his trademarks like a great 70s inspired soundtrack and chunky well written dialogue that moves the plot along.Overall Reservoir dogs isn't QT's best movie but is still a brilliantly fun crime movie that has became one of the most iconic and quotable films of the 90s. Its features tons of famous scenes that became huge in pop culture including Micheal Madsen's controversial scene with a policeman.I'd definitely recommend."
LoneWolfAndCub,"Aug 27, 2005",9/10,"Reservoir Dogs is Quentin Tarantino's first movie, and it's pretty bloody good. I was cautious of this one because I had read mixed reviews of this. But I eventually decided to rent this, it was a great choice.Reservoir Dogs is about a diamond heist gone wrong. They all meet up at a warehouse. This is where we enter a series of flashbacks and confrontations leading up to a huge finale.Sound familiar, OF COURSE. This is a typical Tarantino way of homaging movies he loved as a video store clerk. He really does a brilliant job with this movie. Even thought nothing will top Pulp Fiction this is his second best. This movie has a great cast. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Tarantino himself.This violent masterpiece has earned it's way into many fans and made Tarantino a legend in film-making.4½/5."
bellino-angelo2014,"Sep 20, 2022",9/10,"I have seen this for the first time in October 2017 and found it good. However, last February I rewatched and I found it even much better. Even tho is not for everone (don't let your kids or sensible friends see it) is still great and has to be seen at least once. I also respect that the movie was made on a tiny budget and not by a big studio. Quentin Tarantino managed to assemble a slew of actors known for villanious roles (Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn and film noir veteran Laurence Tierney) and it's in some sort an homage to film noir.Now, since it has to date 1289 reviews and it's on IMDB's top 250, I'll cut to the chase. Suffice to say that the aforementioned guys end in trouble after an heist doesn't go as planned and there is the suspect that one of them is an undercover cop. For the rest, is bloody, full of bad words and very violent... but brilliant and with a great ending."
aidosh94,"Jul 24, 2007",10/10,"I saw this movie about a month ago and I honestly didn't think it was going to be this good! It has everything; an great and cool story, an outstanding cast, cool and fun dialogs with great characters.Harvey Keitel is as good as ever, Steve Buscemi is so fun to watch and makes his character extra funny! Tim Roth and Chris Penn are as good as the rest but the greatest actor and character in this movie has to be Michael Madsen,'cause he made his character believable and cool and no one could have done it better! His character is at the top of my list of greatest movie villains in all of history.Quentin Tarantino is fun too in the movie and he has a natural talent to make these kinds of films and he should continue making them, although I doubt there's going to be a movie as good as this! This movie is really one of the greatest films ever and a special thanks to Michael Madsen (hihi), because without him this movie just wouldn't be the same!"
wickedjazz,"Feb 17, 2019",6/10,Tarantino could have done better. There's some heavy scenes here that were gratuitous without propelling the plot. Seemed like a reason to put A listers in a room together. Still- it's a genre I like so I watched it.
Stibbert,"Jan 10, 2006",8/10,"This is one of those movies you simply hate or simply love. It's a quite strange and slow movie. In my case I liked it, but on the wrong day I might not have.Reservoir Dogs tells the story of a bunch of criminals who's going to rob a diamond warehouse. When things turn south they start to suspect someone is snitching. The question is who.Let's start by saying that there are a lot of talking in this movie. It's basically all just talk. It's also kind of slow and almost the whole movie takes place at only one location. It looks like it's one long scene. The story is not really original, but it's well written. It's not too deep witch is good cause if you needed to pay close attention to all the talking you would be tired after half an hour. This film is about the characters and even though you don't get to know anything about their background you get to know them. You kind of feel like one of them. They don't know each other neither and you learn to know them by the way they act and do on this particular job. The characters are well written and by the end of the movie you have a good idea of who they are.The acting is good. Many famous names are on the list, but if they don't go well together it can screw up the whole movie. This is not the case for Reservoir Dogs. On the contrary, they all work well together and everyone gives a good performance. Steve Buscemi is good as always and Madsens ice cold psycho-performance is great. Tim Roth and Harvey Keitel makes a pair of aces.The cinematography is good. Nothing really good about it nor nothing bad either. There's not any really cool shots, but there are some that sticks. The composition is really nice, but the lightning is nothing too special.One thing Tarantino really know is music. The use of non-original music is genius. It's risky as people may have a relationship to that song and so they may get the wrong impression, but Tarantino manage to succeed. It fits the scene, looks cool and sounds great. This part is really half the experience.To watch this movie you'll need to have an open mind. It's not a ""normal"" movie (but then again Tarantio's not quite normal either). You can turn out to like this movie or you can turn out to hate it. I liked it quite a lot and it's a technically good movie. My personal advise; watch it!"
chera_khalid,"Feb 24, 2025",7/10,"Reservoir Dogs is a solid crime thriller with a gripping premise and intense dialogue, though it has some aspects that could be improved. The film excels in its sharp writing, non-linear storytelling, and memorable performances, particularly from its ensemble cast. The tension between the characters is well-executed, making for a suspenseful experience as the story unfolds.However, despite its strengths, the film isn't without flaws. Some scenes may feel drawn out, and while the dialogue is engaging, certain moments could have been more concise. Additionally, the film's reliance on extended conversations and stylized violence may not appeal to everyone.Overall, Reservoir Dogs is a strong entry in the crime genre, with standout moments and a compelling narrative, but it falls short of being a masterpiece. It delivers a gripping experience, though there's room for improvement in pacing and execution."
hven,"Sep 8, 2003",1/10,"First, I love Tarantino, because he is able (as a director) to follow his own unique style and made a very good movie like Pulp Fiction. But when making Reservoir Dogs, he was (in my opinion) maybe just searching for the borders of what other directors did not dare to do. A movie as RD with (just) a strong focus on violence is not enough for me to give it a high rating. Of course the acting and directing was very good, but I was missing a real strong script. And thats why I could not enjoy this movie and was just very disappointed because my expectations were very high (also based on the high rating on IMDB). So, when you not only like violence, but also care about a good script (story) than you also want to watch the Mob-movies of Martin Scorsese like Good fellas and Casino."
shunandra,"Mar 2, 2013",10/10,"UNC professor Kent Brintnall stated, ""Tarantino's film is, on one reading, a reductio ad absurdum on the cult of masculinity""; film-maker and critic Robert Hilferty noted,""violent language and violent acts define the power politics of male sexuality, on which Reservoir Dogs is a virtual tragicomic essay"".Every frame in Reservoir Dogs exists to expose the damaging consequences of our society's warped view of masculinity and how it is intertwined with violence. The film's emotional core, and what elevates it to greatness, is the profound bond that exists between Mr. White and Mr. Orange. Their non-traditional dynamic (in which they both exhibit ""feminine"" traits; White's compassion/tenderness, Orange's vulnerability) is presented as something superior that exists outside of the masculine. The way 12 Angry Men is a film featuring white men while exposing the trappings of white male privilege, Reservoir Dogs is a film featuring hyper-masculinity that celebrates gender non- conformativity. It is Tarantino's most moral and complex work."
Pedro_H,"Feb 8, 2004",8/10,"A set of criminals gather in a garage to discuss a jewel heist that has gone tragically wrong.What a fantastic film to start a career with. Tarantino shows that while he has never been to film school he knows what he wants and he knows how to get it. This doesn't take cinema to a new level but shows how to make a simple story - that could have been a cheap TV movie in someone else's hands - in to something epic. Yes epic, not a word I use very often.If you want proof that stories are in the telling, the mood and the music just look here. The story is nothing, but the delivery and the acting make it what it is.There really is no substantial plot. It is just throw you off balance cinema. Roth plays a man bleeding to death on a floor through most of the movie: what a fantastic device and so original. Who would have thought of that? Who indeed would not only have thought of that, but used it so effectively?The criminals (known by colours - or is it colors?) are funny, dangerous and strangely real. Real people that squabble over names, food and even tips. People that go from killing to small talk to humour as if it as all the same thing, in the same way that Prince goes from talking about sex to god as if it is also part of the same thing. Is this real? Is this how real criminals talk and behave. Not in the main, no, but probably true of a minority. The only problem - beyond this movie - is whether he can capture other types of criminals. The question remains open.Criminals, cops and  bystanders are all out to earn a dollar and return home to watch TV. The criminal is caught by one policeman and takes it out on another, who knows nothing about the original crime. People are in the wrong place at the wrong time. We have outlaws, but they are 9-2-5 outlaws, they want to eat out and drive nice cars. They are career criminals for whom the real world is too much like hard work. They want to live off the fat of the land, like the idle rich. They may have had real jobs (indeed they say they have), but it is not for them.As I said earlier, the plot is nothing. It is a frame for mood and atmosphere (what Kubrick took twenty years to learn Tarantino knows day one) and how it all turns out doesn't really matter. It is a journey, not a destination.Is the film moral? Not really. It is a mixed bag, but he is more moral than some comedies where out-of-work middle aged couples ride of in to the sunset having robbed a bank. Movie morals are different, it is not that people are dead, but how they died that matters. If you believe that cinema should include all people from society then films such as this should exist.Sadly Tarantino loses control in the ""ear"" scene. I have nothing against the haunted house experience, but you can only spend so much time in it before emerging in to light. Making the audience nauseous is no achievement. Nor is shocking it. We can all do it. In life or on film.All movies have to have drama and to create all drama we must have conflict. We haven't much to play with here. It is a minimalist playbox, although we have the robbery (used sparingly and not at the beginning as most fly-by-nights would use it) and some gun play, but these are sidelines. This is a relationship play. People (criminals) that want both anarchy and order. They come together for greed, but the pecking order has to be established. It is not easy being leader of the anarchist, they are, by nature free thinkers that play and work for themselves.It doesn't let anyone believe that being a criminal is easy or a good career options. After all, as I hinted above, who are you working with? Other criminals who only want to look after themselves and would happily steal for you as much as the original target. This doesn't make it as clear as say Goodfellers, but the message is there all the same.When this film came out it maybe it wasn't as big a deal as is made out to be now. However the industry stood up and took notice as did most film buffs. This is something new and - as has been shown with the better Pulp Fiction - the product of  someone that has the seeds of magic in his fingers. Sadly QT started to believe his own hype, and worse started thinking that he only had to please himself to please his audience.The problem is that QT is like the sexy girl your old school class. The problem isn't that she is sexy, the problem is that she knows it."
Bogey Man,"Oct 20, 2002",9/10,"Quentin Tarantino's love affair with cinema is clearly visible with this debut film of his, RESERVOIR DOGS (1992), a film which belongs to one of the most memorable and important American films of the 1990's. Tarantino wrote and directed this film and the result is great. This is the kind of film that doesn't require millions of dollars from some major studio and it's (of course) ten times better and noteworthy film than many of those which require.The story is taken from Hong Kong film maker Ringo Lam's masterpiece City on Fire (1986) which is one of Tarantino's favorite movies which I understand. A bunch of criminals unknown to each other and following a plan which was meant to be flawless and water proof rob a diamond store. Something went wrong and a violent gun battle and quest for life and freedom took place and it was obvious there was a ""rat"" among them who informed the force about the details of the robbery. The film is told as a flashback as some of the gangsters, Mr. White (Harvey Keitel), Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi) and Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), arrive to their meeting place in an abandoned storehouse waiting for the others, Mr. Orange very severely injured as a result of a gun shot wound. Other cast includes Tarantino himself, Eddie Bunker, Lawrence Tierney, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn and they're all as great and interesting as the story and its many sides.The film is a homage to masters like Martin Scorsese and several Hong Kong directors like John Woo and of course Ringo Lam. Their films usually depict honor and loyalty between men and criminals and how they are ready to risk their lives for a friend and the one they love. RESERVOIR DOGS has these same themes and they are as soulful and believable here as in GoodFellas or A Better Tomorrow, to name just a few films. Also the statement about tipping and the position of many ""uneducated females in America"" at the beginning is definitely an important one and despite the scene being pretty funny, it is also serious and important.The characters are great and speak much, but not in vain. They are interesting and real and the dialogue just secures this by forcing the viewer to go with the verbal flow inside the characters' soul. The dialogue is often very clever and also very funny and witty without being stupid. Tarantino is great screenwriter and story teller, too, and the flashback structure of RESERVOIR DOGS proved this for the first time. The soundtrack is again very nostalgic with many seventies classics which Tarantino grew up with so it is another homage this film maker wanted to make with this first film of his.The film is occasionally pretty violent but the violence is never glorified or made look good and entertaining. It is raw and painful and never without its results. Mr. Blonde (Madsen) is one of the most sadistic screen psychos of the nineties and he is definitely willing to use violence ""just for the fun of it"" but it doesn't pay in this film any more than in real life, either, and the gangsters learn it the hard way during the film and their fateful 2 minutes robbery.RESERVOIR DOGS is personal and intelligent film and began the film career its director had dreamt about during the years he worked at the video store, and this film once again proves what can be done when there are talented makers and ideas which don't require major studios and huge amount of money. It is great Harvey understood the talent of Tarantino and wanted to help him begin his life as a film maker.9/10"
Tcarts76,"Sep 24, 2012",9/10,"This was and is, by far, Quentin Tarantino's best work ever. I could care less about Pulp Fiction, that was a decent movie that did well commercially but this one is his crowning achievement.This movie is well arranged. The Dialogue IS the movie. You can sit and turn the picture off on this one and the audio itself tells the story. The Music is absolutely great and well chosen. The acting was not extremely great, but that itself was also a masterstroke. The budget was small, the sets almost non existent, yet Tarantino created a wonderful piece of film making art, and assembled a cast worth watching. There was plenty of dark comedy mixed with the signature violence and blood that always accompanies Tarantino.The Characters have no names and are introduced only as colors, and that is one of the best scenes of this movie. It is a perfect blend of comedy, violence, crime, character development, plot, all told in a unique and intriguing way.Tarantino will probably never make a movie as well as this one again. He now basks in his own cult following and his love of bad B horror of the 1970's, and seems content in giving us horrible movies, bringing back a genre that nobody ever wanted to see (except really crazy people that rarely get out of their own basements) and there was a reason Hollywood stopped making.I say celebrate this one outstanding movie and remember Quentin when he used to be a decent film maker."
Alvaro-5,"Oct 23, 1998",10/10,"One of the best characterizations I´ve seen for movies this decade.  Truly a work of art.  Tarantino´s emphasis on miniscule and details and great camera movements are a great relief for all those cookie cut director´s now adays. Pulp fiction is still his best, but Reservoir dogs is a pretty close second. One of the top ten movies this decade."
gigan-92,"Jan 31, 2011",10/10,"There are so many perspectives on which to praise ""Reservoir Dogs"". First and foremost, it has the edgy realism that began to slip away in the ""Kill Bill"" films (which I still very much praise and enjoy), and was completely discarded in his recent film ""Inglourious Basterds"". It's like recently Tarantino let his fame go to his head and just went all out without thinking about if what he showed on screen made any real sense. This film of his, basically his first three, are the ones I admire the most. Not to mention the way the story is told, it's just very intriguing from the start. We see only brief glimpses of what actually happened at this bank job that apparently went very, very, bad. The cast was phenomenal throughout and this film had the chemistry to really make the tension play out realistically and brutally later on. The atmosphere is solid and full of well acted malice and is pretty unpredictable. In fact, amidst all the insane and gruesome scenes which some may struggle to sit through (""Can you hear me now?"")is a very nicely paced plot that in reality is probably one of the greatest crime/thriller pieces ever written.The talent here is undeniable, and every performance is just awesome. The ones I really admired the most were that of Harvey Keitel as Mr. White, and definitely Steve Buscemi as Mr. Pink. And where as I believe every individual character stood out quite well, the two that stirred up the most in me was Tim Roth as the nefarious Mr. Orange, but over all Michael Madsen as the sadistic Mr. Blonde. I will never forget Madsen as the soda sipping psychopath. Tarantino does well himself I must admit, and kudos to the often over-looked performance of Kirk Baltz as the unfortunate Officer Marvin Nash.With its tremendously talented cast breathing life into these characters we know so little about, coupled with its very involving story and well placed music, it all comes together as arguably Tarantino's most refined work."
milky_rakes,"Jan 24, 1999",N/A,"Plot Summary for Long hu feng yun (1987) http://us.imdb.com/Plot?Long+hu+feng+yun+(1987)Yes, it seems that Chow Yun-Fat played the Mr. Orange in Reservoir Dogs part a year or so earlier.Quentin Tarentino was said to have worked in a video store at the time he penned the screen play. Whether he is conscious of the similarities is unclear.Regardless, by itself, Reservoir Dogs is an example of American filmmaking distilled from American filmmaking.  Tarentino has taken thousands of hours of film and video and produced a new piece of work.  The question whether this film is entirely original hurts, but not enough to remove this film as a new benchmark for filmmakers.To say it simply, films can demonstrate aspects of life that change our lives, sometimes long after the movie is forgotten.  There are very direct educational or industrial training films and then there are films that provide deep insight into human behavior and the relationships between people.I thought the black suits used by the gang of jewel thieves was ripped off ofOcean's Eleven (1960) http://us.imdb.com/Title?Ocean%27s+Eleven+(1960)And that's the heist movie that I used for comparison. I've always hated gangsters, in real-life and in the movies, and I always hated the images that Frank Sinatra purveyed as a gangster (in real-life and in the movies). ""Reservoir Dogs"" doesn't try to seduce the audience into thinking that the criminals are at all likeable. Frank Sinatra's ""charisma"" was just as slimy as his real life.I had always liked heist films, usually from the point of view of the thieves. But this film changed all of that. It is easier for me to realize nowadays that thieves would be much more like Michael Madsen's Mr. Blonde rather than the singin' and dancin' ""rat pack"" alcoholics.Life gets tougher. Harvey Keitel's ""Mr. White"" was the only character to show even a small amount of concern for any other living thing, and his care and concern was the mistake that brought the entire heist to its bloody end.Not easy lessons to learn. Certainly not the happy news I was hoping for. For me, spiritualism seem silly since we have so many real-life vampires and predators among us.""Reservoir Dogs"".  Most city water reservoirs are on hilltops or out of the way. Most cities buy up the land around the reservoir to add an additional buffer. These areas are usually wooded, kind of wild. The reservoir is kind of a ""no-man's land"" and any dogs seen there are probably wild."

Steady_Hands,"Aug 17, 2024",7/10,"Reservoir Dogs is one of Tarantino's best movies. While it copies much from the Hong Kong movie City on Fire, it stands out as a unique piece of storytelling. However, I do wish there had been a scene depicting the actual heist itself, as the film primarily focuses on the aftermath and the characters' interactions. The script spends a significant amount of time in the warehouse where the characters gather, which can become monotonous and even a bit boring at times. Despite these shortcomings, Reservoir Dogs excels in its sharp dialogue, well-developed characters, and outstanding performances from the cast. The interactions between characters like Mr. White and Mr. Pink are particularly memorable, showcasing Tarantino's talent for crafting compelling conversations that reveal deeper motivations and tensions. The film's aesthetic, while gritty, effectively complements its themes of betrayal and loyalty among criminals. The iconic soundtrack, featuring songs from the '70s, adds an extra layer of enjoyment, contrasting with the film's violent scenes and enhancing the overall experience."
me_is_we,"Jan 3, 2020",5/10,This movie is just another Hollywood script with no original twist. It was visually boring and nothing new under the sun.
newnoir,"Oct 18, 2000",N/A,"With all the hoopla about 'Pulp Fiction' many people forget that this QT film was much better, in my opinion.  Grittier, more violent, brutal, funnier.  It's amazing what a filmmaker can come up with when his whole story revolves around a bunch of gangsters hanging around an old warehouse and just talking, bitching and bleeding.  A nice little film noir flick. With influences by John Woo, Kubrick, Big Jim Thompson, and Scorsese.  I don't know why, but I also liked the nice shade of green the warehouse interior was painted.  The multicolored graffiti background that Mr. Orange uses as a mock stage to practice his commode story was a nice touch too. These are the weird little details of a film that only I probably like."

oldman007,"May 6, 2006",10/10,"This movie was very well made. Let me start off by saying that I'm not a fan on Quentin Tarintino. I can't stand his work. I thought Reservoir Dogs would be the same, but I was wrong. Just by judging the way the cover was, it looked like a gangster movie where they spend the whole movie in the bank, but it isn't. It's about the perfect robbery that gets organised and it goes terribly wrong. They then realise one of them is a cop, but which one, is it? It was quite a change to actually have a relationship with gangsters for once. It was good to know that gangsters are human too. In an evil way, but they are still human. Most people say ""They're gangsters, they're not human."" But it's not true. They are human. Quentin Tarintino makes them human. It explains their backgrounds and how they got their job, etc. It had great 70's songs too such as ""Stuck in the middle With You"" by Steeler's Wheel. The cast is fantastic. They do act childish in their situation, but who wouldn't? All he characters in this are so lovable. This film is very important because it's exactly what gangsters do and i'm 99% certain it's what they talk about. It's just good to have a relationship with bad guys for a change instead of the good guys all the time. I recommend it to Quentin tarintino lovers and people who love gangster films. 10/10 Advice: A lot of people hate reservoir Dogs, which is fine, but don't get mad. Don't say something like ""You just didn't get it and you're not adult"", it's the fact that they don't like it.Respect their opinion. You can't make everyone love the same movie. The world would be boring.Oh, and another thing, just so the people who haven't seen this, there's no action in this movie, it's all about the dialog."
rightback15,"Mar 24, 2007",10/10,"I watched Reservoir Dogs for the first time a week ago and couldn't really understand what all of the fuss was about and why people rated it as a good film, Then i watched it again, an then again and then i did start to understand.I think that Quentin Tarantino did a brilliant job with this film, (to say it was his first), and also casted a few characters out of this film into Pulp Fiction etc.But there was a little bit about this film that i did not understand, the Violence. It was supposed to have been banned in a few countries due to the fact of the violence. If you watch films today such as A Man Apart, that is an extremely violent film, but if you think about the Rating in 1992, violence and cinema has evolved a lot!I also think that the cast for this film is just, THE BEST! Michael Madsen, Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth and Steve Buscemi i think play their roles perfect and the film couldn't have been better! According to the IMDb, Reservoir Dogs is Rated #64 in the Top 250, i think it could be a lot higher in the list because i think that this film is a classic that will never become forgotten, its just one of those films that has made a huge impact since it was first released.Reservoir Dogs - 10/10 (I would advise that you watch this film without youngers, it does get abit Graphic:))"
Barky44,"Nov 9, 2005",10/10,"What a great movie.Yeah, it's horribly violent and profane, with lots of gore.But this really is a character study of a certain class of criminals.This represents not only the best of what independent films can be, but also how you can get tremendous bang for very little buck if you have a good script and good actors.Notice this film has very sparse sets, no chase sequences, very few stunts, and no special effects. Yeah, there's one dog but beyond that there are no tricks at all. Just great dialog well delivered.This is a classic. Quentin Tarantino at his near-best (in my opinion he parlayed this into Pulp Fiction, his best work).It's a shame that Tarantino hasn't been more prolific. But his handful of films truly revolutionized the whole indie genre.10 out of 10.Barky"
ChookieBomb,"Jan 26, 2000",10/10,"This movie is, in my opinion, one of the better movies of the past decade. Tarantino proves that you don't need glitzy special effects and a multi-million dollar budget to make a great film. If you liked Pulp Fiction, I highly recommend this."

You might say that I am a movie freak - at least I'm one of those people that even though I complain about lots of movies in the new millenium - I still faithfully sit and wonder how they still have the ability to sometimes amaze me in the movie industry... This is one of the few movies I have watched, that I really can not find a single frame that I would like to be different - and that is actually the greatest compliment that I can offer a film director... In this case Tarantino really started off with perfection and now... well we don't really hear anything from him anymore and Jackie Brown was a great movie but nothing spectacular. The scene with Michael Madsen and the poor policeman in Reservoir Dogs will haunt me for the rest of my life... never have I seen a scene so fascinating and yet so repulsive ! If you are one of those few people that haven't seen this movie, please rent it or better yet go to a movie theater where they show it... One of my best friends left the theater when I took her to see this movie - she could not stand to watch the violence - but she is also such a kind spirit... so if you only like romantic movies like Splendor in the Grass or When Harry Met Sally - then you should stay away from this one... Not that I have anything against Splendor in the Grass - actually I think that Kazan has made a very beautiful movie about the suppression of sexuality in a ""middleclass"", Christian society... but it was just to illustrate that this movie is as far away from that as possible... :o)"
andrew-hill515,"Dec 24, 2018",7/10,"Tarantino is a bit hit and miss. Some of his films are pretty good, some are good in parts, and some are just bad.
This is one of the better ones, up there with the first Kill Bill movie, one of the storylines in Pulp fiction (the scenes with Uma Thurman were a snooze and the Bruce Willis story should have been cut) and Django Unchained (until the stupid last couple of scenes after Tarantino shows up with an... Is that meant to be an Australian accent? South African? Dutch? Whatever)."
MaxBorg89,"Oct 23, 2005",10/10,"Pulp Fiction made him a worldwide phenomenon, but it was the very first screening of Reservoir Dogs, his directorial debut, at Sundance in 1992, that proved Quentin Tarantino, a former video store clerk with no formal training behind the camera (except for a failed experiment called My Best Friend's Birthday), was a force to be reckoned with: mixing Sergio Leone, the French New Wave and Asain thrillers in the same package (and adding a lot more on the way), his first feature doesn't boast that much originality, but it has energy, passion, violence and wit.Ostensibly a classic heist flick, Dogs is about a bunch of criminals who are brought together by the edgy Joe Cabot (Lawrence Tierney) to perform an apparently flawless robbery. These people have no real names, at least not when they're together: job-wise, they will just be known as Mr. White (Harvey Keitel, one of the driving forces behind this film's making), Mr. Orange (Tim Roth), Mr. Blonde (Michael Madsen), Mr. Blue (Edward Bunker), Mr. Brown (QT himself) and Mr. Pink (Steve Buscemi). With some minor help from Joe's son ""Nice Guy"" Eddie (Chris Penn), things should go smoothly.Obviously, they don't: by the time the opening credits are over, we know the job went wrong, as the surviving ""dogs"" (including a seriously injured Orange) gather in a warehouse and try to figure out what happened. Through a clever use of non-linear narrative, we learn how they were approached by Joe, the aftermath of the heist (the robbery itself is never depicted on-screen) and their suspicions regarding a potential undercover cop in the group.The storytelling technique is obviously borrowed from Jean-Luc Godard, who famously said: ""A film should have a beginning, a middle and an end, but not necessarily in that order"" (coincidentally, QT's production company, A Band Apart, is also named after one of Godard's movies). The plot, however, is the smallest of Tarantino's concerns. What really matters here is the execution, the style. And what a style: the seamless merger of images and music (see the opening credits), with the additional brilliant idea of having virtually all the songs (no original tunes here) come from an internal source, namely a radio program, the Scorsese-inspired long takes, the innovative use of violence (excessive but often amusing, rather than revolting, as in the famous torture scene).And then, of course, there's the dialogue, the primary reason to watch any of Tarantino's films. The audience at Sundance was memorably shocked by the opening sequence, which explains nothing about the story but gives precious insight regarding the characters: Mr. White has a short temper, Mr. Pink doesn't believe in tipping and Mr. Brown is firmly convinced Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"" has a pretty crude significance (in true QT style, the language is not something the easily offended will embrace). That's just one of many quotable sound-bites, which also showcase the talent of Tarantino's ensemble cast: the standouts are Keitel, Roth and the psychotic Madsen, but everyone, even Bunker, whose role is - on the surface - less prominent, gets a well deserved moment of screen immortality.The cast (Keitel most notably) is also further proof of how Reservoir Dogs doesn't ""look"" like a traditional '90s first feature. Unlike Clerks, which was deliberately constructed like a home-made extravaganza, Dogs never flaunts its small scale or limited locations (the bulk of the movie takes place in the warehouse). It's a little movie that thinks big, and the Weinstein brothers were clever enough to see it in 1992, when they bought the film and gave Tarantino free reins to do whatever the hell he wanted after that. The rest, as they say, is recent motion picture history."
alan_2519,"Aug 31, 2019",6/10,"I was looking forward to the film so much because of the vast amount of strong recommendations from friends and the online community. I think because the expectation was so high, I was expecting a block buster.I did enjoy the film especially the most exciting parts of the film. However, I didn't really care about some of the back stories because it didn't really capture me. I found myself looking at my phone to pass the time down waiting for the next scene to start. Overall, it's a solid film and a worthy one because it's quite short for an hour and a half. If it was any longer, then my rating would be a 5."
anthonyx,"Feb 21, 2001",N/A,"why do so many people like this film?  is it because theres heaps of swearing? is it because theres lots of violence? whatever it is, its certainly not because it has a good storyline or interesting characters. sure, there were some good classic lines in the movie, but over all it is a very dull and boring movie.  at the time of its release, i guess it gained attention because it was different and ""innovative"".  it should be cut down to 30 mintues and take ever 2nd f!@# out so only every 4th word is f@#$. pulp fiction is a far better movie.  so i wouldnt recommend this film to anyone except for kids who think eminem is cool cause he says ""f!@#"" alot."
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Jul 30, 2005",10/10,"Reservoir Dogs is probably one of the smartest crime films that I have ever seen. Quentin Tarantino is one of the most brilliant minded directors in the history of film-making who came out of a video store to making one of most popular crime film. Reservoir Dogs is capable of having small time actors (with the exception of Harvey Keitel) and making them put up fantastic and mind-blowing performances. This is what a great script can do to actors. The dialogue is so amazing, the music is incredible especially the song, ""Little Green Bag"" in the beginning of the film, and of course the acting is sensational. Reservoir Dogs is breathtaking and trust me I have a lot of favorite films, but Reservoir Dogs falls in my top 10. It is a pure adrenaline rush and is one of the greatest films ever made. I highly recommend it!Hedeen's Outlook: 10/10!! **** A+"
RainDogJr,"May 15, 2007",10/10,"I saw Death Proof last month and the first person that i want to comment about the film was my cousin, because he is a horror films fan and like me , he loves films and love Quentin Tarantino. The first thing that he told was: Tarantino is in decadence? I say, that Death Proof was a good film but he told that wasn't a Grindhouse film. Well we talk about Tarantino and i think that is difficult for a director to stay in the top for almost 15 years i well, i think that the masterpieces of Tarantino came very early for a regular director. Almost all the greatest directors in all the planet have like a good beginning but later, like 4 films later, it comes their masterpiece, like Scorsese with Taxi Driver, Coppola with The Godfather or Chaplin with City Lights.In my opinion a young director will grow up like 3 or 4 films later but i doesn't means that their first works aren't good like Mean Steets of Scorsese, that is a great film but is not his best.With Tarantino is was all different: his first film is a classic right now and his second film (i mean Pulp Fiction) is his masterpiece and also a classic.Then Jackie Brown, Kill Bill 1 and 2 and now Death Proof are all really great films but for me this 4 films can't be compared whit his first 2 films: Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction.The conclusion of this question that says me my cousin is that: Tarantino makes his best work in his first 3 years like a director with is two masterpieces Reservoir Dogs and Pulp Fiction but i don't think that Tarantino is in decadence for a simple reason: His latest works aren't so good like the firsts ones but still are really good films.Sorry and well now about the film Reservoir Dogs: This film contains an excellent cast that includes one of my favorites actors: Tim Roth, Harvey Keitel and Steve Buscemi. Also Michael Madsen, Chris Pen and Tarantino are very good but like a surprise the cast isn't the best part of the film, the best part are the dialogs.The dialogs of the song of Madonna or the dialog with Mr Pink about the tips are excellent and really funny.The films is short and you never bored with Tarantino. Excellent performances, excellent debut and is this Tarantino's best?? this is a hard question but i think that the best is Pulp Fiction but Reservoir Dogs is very close.Reservoir Dogs: 10"
sandnair87,"Apr 23, 2015",9/10,"Tarantino has an almost impenitent appetite for blood-spattered barbarism, we all know that. But in his gritty, brutal crime-caper Reservoir Dogs – a tantalizing debut feature that put the name Quentin Tarantino into the cinematic spotlight - his testosterone level is off every chart, as he happily wallows in his own adolescent love of criminals, violence, and vulgarity. So much so that, the movie appears to be set in a theme park called 'Testosterone-land', where nature isn't only red in tooth and claw, it's black as the heart of man and dank as any rag and bone shop of the human spirit.Tarantino gets things off to a spectacularly engrossing start, as Reservoir Dogs begins with the iconic sequence involving the coffee- shop banter of six morally ambiguous outlaws. Yes, they are meant to be an urban wild-bunch, but damn, if they aren't charming and charismatic! Decked out in matching black suits and thin black ties, they've been brought together by a mob kingpin specifically to pull off a heist, and they've been kept deliberately ignorant of one another's identities, knowing each other only by their color coded pseudonyms. The heist is to be a one-shot deal - one job and they scatter to the winds. Soon after masterful opening gabfest, when you start settling in with the idea that Tarantino has made a heist movie, he pulls a coup by skipping right over the robbery itself. Instead, it cuts straight to the aftermath, as we find our wolf-pack hole up in a warehouse after the heist goes belly up, each trying to figure out which one of them squawked to the police. Dissension and suspicion run high and soon, it becomes clear to the audience that at least one of these guys is a snitch, but which one?Tarantino's glitziest stroke in his heist drama is never to show the main event: the film's 'action' occurs after the heist. Tarantino expertly builds tension, interweaving scenes of the aftermath of the thieves' foiled heist with scenes depicting them getting ready for the heist, backtracking in time and point of view half a dozen times. Each flashback reveals just enough information to fill in a piece of the puzzle. His palpable enthusiasm, his unapologetic passion for what he's created reinvigorates this venerable plot and, mayhem aside, makes it involving for longer than you might suspect. His trademarks of amplified violence and vulgar dialogue are in full force, as are the flurry of obscure to not-so-obscure pop culture references woven into the dialogue. Part of the appeal of Reservoir Dogs is the way it makes all of it feel terribly authentic, a veracity that is a tribute to the skill of its actors, particularly Michael Madsen who is awesome as the sadistic yet painfully cool Mr. Blonde and Steve Buscemi who is deadpan funny as the always-on-the- edge Mr. Pink.Reservoir Dogs grabs you by the throat and digs its claws in deep. It may seem hideously ugly on paper, but in the sure way it's made, it's inconveniently dazzling - driven, beautifully made and completely wacko at once. It's pure outlaw art!"
beardsworthy,"Mar 4, 2023",9/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" is a crime thriller movie directed by Quentin Tarantino that tells the story of a group of criminals who are hired to rob a jewelry store. The movie features an all-star cast, including Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, and Michael Madsen, among others.While the movie does have the word ""dogs"" in its title, it's not about actual dogs. Instead, it's a slang term used to describe the undercover police officers who infiltrate criminal organizations. So, if you were waiting for cute and cuddly dogs to show up on the screen, you might have been disappointed.However, if you can move past your initial expectations, you might find ""Reservoir Dogs"" to be an engaging and intense movie that keeps you on the edge of your seat. The movie's non-linear storytelling, memorable characters, and sharp dialogue have made it a classic of the crime genre.So, while it's understandable that you were disappointed that there were no actual dogs in ""Reservoir Dogs,"" I encourage you to give the movie a chance and appreciate it for what it is - a gripping crime thriller that has stood the test of time."

The heist isn't well planned as they thought and the criminals also thinks that there's a rat in their gag. But time is running out for these criminals.Written and Directed by Quentin Tarantino (Kill Bill Vol.1 & Vol.2, Jackie Brown, Pulp Fiction) made an fascinating crime film with interesting characters, sharp dialogue and moments of dark humour. This independent movie was well received by the critics and did fine at the art-house circuit. The performances are excellent, especially by Buscemi, Roth and Madsen. Madsen has the most talked about infamous sequence in the movie. The picture was certainly a hit big on video.DVD has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong DTS 6.1 ES Audio (Also in Dolby Digital 5.1 Ex Audio). Disc One two informative commentaries. Commentary one is the cast & crew. Commentary two is by the film critics. Also Disc One has amusing Pulp Factoids opinion. Disc two has plenty of features for the 15th anniversary edition. Although there's some features are not in this new DVD, back from the 10th anniversary edition. This is certainly a breakthrough movie, it was Tarantino's first film. Since Tarantino has a top cast and crew. Keitel co-produced this movie as well. One of the best pictures of 1992. Super 35.

FilmCriticLalitRao,"Jul 19, 2007",1/10,"Everybody knows that criminals are big losers but still there is a strong tradition in American cinema especially in Hollywood of making films which glorify criminals.Everybody knows that Godfather,a film about a mafia family is hailed as a classic film.People know well as to what kind of things mafia do and how harmful they are to human society in general.Reservoir Dogs is one such dumb film which through its antics champions the cause of crooks without morals.Tarantino is believed to be a humorist however his humor is undoubtedly bland and mainly consists of filthy abuses.A word about the violence in the film: by showing macabre scenes of senseless violence Tarantino has shown that in the name of creative freedom and in order to gain easy publicity all rules can be broken and more the violence the more controversial the film is going to be.Good that this film has not been emulated by other film makers. It is a good development that till now no studio has come forward with the idea of making a sequel of this film.God save America who has Quentino."

This movie is for the 'thinking' man: no special effects and stuff like that just for amusement's sake.Buscemi at his best, and Roth not that bad. Each man gives the aura of urgency, while Keitel balances them with spooky calmness."

Unlike some recent overrated movies that are rated by nothing but meaningless violence or exaggerated Vfx, Reservoir Dogs its indeed violent, but in a unprecedented way, using its violence to build a great story with good character's personality development, that's why this movie truly deserves its reputation. In my opinion, the best Tarantino movie so far.I highly recommend this movie.10/10"
ericstevenson,"Apr 16, 2018",9/10,"This movie was Quentin Tarantino's directorial debut and is considered to be one of the best directorial debuts ever. You could tell he was destined for greatness. It's also easy to say that this was Steve Buscemi's best role. Like his later film ""Pulp Fiction"", it's told in an nonlinear form of storytelling. The final scene is still the final scene unlike that movie. The best scene is probably at the beginning with the tipping argument.Mr. Blonde is a complete sadist, yet he thinks it's immoral to not tip waitresses. I had seen bits and pieces of this movie before. It's certainly great, but not uh, one of the best movies ever made? I always want to see films in the Top 250. This movie tells the story of a diamond heist gone wrong. One of the six men involved is believed to be a snitch, but I won't spoil the rest of it. ***1/2"
hollywoodhorrorchick,"Apr 9, 2007",8/10,"I love this film because you can see all of Tarantino's potential as a filmmaker seeping out of every corner. Compared to Pulp Fiction, Kill Bill, etc, Reservoir Dogs is quite simple, lower budget, shorter, and noticeably less mature. But the magic is still there, and his style is already quite distinct. Kind of like looking at someone's baby pictures. He has always had an amazing ability to choose soundtrack material, and this movie is no exception. The cast is perfect, although there are no female characters. (Forgivable considering the plot, and he has more than proved his appreciation for the strong leading woman in subsequent films.) All are truly unique, at varying levels of likability, and there is never a dull moment with the lot."
Movie-Dood198027,"Mar 7, 2025",8/10,"So , finally watched the first film that was soley directed by Mr. Quentin Tarantino , His style is unique and his dialouges are very memorable and his cast picks are always good , Harvey Keitel , Steve Buscemi , Tim roth and other great cast , Quentin Also Plays Mr Brown which is a casual thing where Quentin Acts in his movies which is nice.The plot is kind of confusing when you first watch the film , the non-linear storytelling that was inspired by some VERY good films including (The killing) , A kubrick motion picture that inspired Quentin to make this film and i say that The killing is still better that reservoir dogs simply because of how good the non-linear storytelling was in that film.But this film was great, the acting was great , the dialouge was probably the best part , steve buscemi was the best character in the film also had the best acting performance in it.And overall the movie needs a rewatch because it kinda was lower than what i expected it was most of all dialouge and such but it's not a bad start for the legendary directing career of Mr. Quentin Tarantino."
t_gilks,"Aug 23, 2001",6/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" contains the same macho, profane, tough-guy attitude and non-linear story telling as Tarantino's other film, ""Pulp Fiction"", but lacks the love of dialogue and the diversity and interest of characters. The characters in ""Pulp Fiction"" all had views, mannerisms, and characteristics all their own. They loved to talk, and we loved to hear them, because, insightful, funny or just plain stupid, Tarantino made everything they say interesting. In ""Reservoir Dogs"" however, almost every word spoken serves only to advance the plot. The characters are more or less interchangeable. None of them say anything that you couldn't imagine another character saying. With the exception of Red (Madsen) and Orange (Roth) none of the diamond thieves have any background. There is very little uniqueness to any character in this movie.I mentioned the non-linear storytelling that was used in both ""Reservoir Dogs"" and ""Pulp Fiction"", unfortunately however, the concept that was so exciting in ""Pulp Fiction"", seems like a gimmicky way of hiding the movie's greatest flaw: Nothing much happens. The story involves a robbery (which we don't see) and the setup to the robbery (which we don't care about, because we don't see the robbery).With ""Pulp Fiction"" already out on DVD and video, there is very little reason to see this movie, apart from, of course, curiousity."

Gary-161,"Nov 20, 2001",N/A,Despicable thriller that reads like a manual for a south American death squad only without the cheap aftershave. Interesting to me only as an almost total inversion of Tarkovsky's cinema. It is set almost entirely in an (ZZZZZZZZ) abandoned warehouse. Rutger Hauer and Robert Patrick do not appear obviously due to a prior engagement at another abandoned warehouse on an even smaller budget. Any potential interest is drowned by verbosity such as a laborious show and tell by an undercover cop telling a rest room porky to impress some gangsters. Silliest moment appears when the gang commit a robbery in exactly the same conspicuous outfits they have previously been showing out with in a very public cafe.
justahunch-70549,"Nov 28, 2022",10/10,"I hadn't seen this film since 1992 and the only scenes I remembered were the opening with a bunch of thieves sitting around vulgarly talking about singers and whatnot, a cop tied to a chair in a warehouse and someone profusely bleeding in the backseat of a car. I had forgotten the plot itself and I am so glad I did. There were a few times that I was probably just as stunned by twists and actions as I was the first time. This low budget film about a planned jewelry heist by a first time director is some sort of masterpiece of violence, machismo and mayhem. That it wasn't even a hit when released is amazing. The direction is brilliant and the performances are all outstanding particularly Tim Roth, though again, the six principle actors are all wonderful. We all know about that first time director now. It's hard to tell what is Quentin Tarantino's best film, but this is in the equation. This is essentially a simple plot and he would go on to make much more complex and intricate films, but the roots of every Tarantino is here. This is short, tight, immensely effective with an awesome usage of songs, but that has become commonplace in his films by now. Time has not made this any less potent. I won't live long enough to forget most of this again."

It's always a good thing when the debut of someone is good, because it says that they'll go and do great things, which Tarantino has obviously done. Of all the things that this movie went through, it's still great that it is here for us to see. Or at least, the few who enjoy excessive violence, which is what this movie is immersed in. See it with adults.Still, I wouldn't venture to say that this is my favorite Tarantino movie, but it's still good regardless. Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, and Steve Buscemi are awesome as Mr. White, Mr. Orange, and Mr. Pink."
troy-daniel-bush,"Jul 12, 2021",8/10,"I've been watching through all of Tarantino's films and I have an unpopular opinion with regards to this one.As my rating and title implies, I love this movie! For a first movie it's really impressive. Most likely because Tarantino's a movie freak, it doesn't feel like it's written and directed by an amateur. After all, the first script he wrote, True Romance, doesn't feel like it's written by an amateur.As with all of his movies...
The characters are distinct and interesting.The dialogue is quotable.That scene that is meant to be disturbing is still disturbing.It's unpredictable.The humor is solid.The cinematography is superb.The soundtrack choices are very catchy.The acting is amazing.On top of all that...
The movie flies by.It doesn't feel low budget. You can thank Tarantino's deft hand.However, I consider this to be one of Tarantino's weaker movies. I know that's a hot take, but I think he's made better movies than this. This is my personal ranking of his films:Pulp Fiction 10/10
The Hateful Eight 10/10
Once Upon A Time In Hollywood 10/10
Kill Bill 10/10
Django Unchained 8/10

mtrburrows,"Aug 4, 2018",8/10,"As someone who considers Pulp Fiction to be one of the best movies ever made, I was looking forward to seeing a movie made by the same writer/director about a group of criminals playing off each other after a heist gone wrong. And when the Dogs are arguing, stressing out, fighting in that werehouse, you can truly see the roots of Tarantino's style, because anything that takes place in that warehouse truly had me hooked.Me White and Mr Pink are definitely the standouts, with both actors giving a brilliant performance and their squabbles feeling realistic and tense.However, the film begins to lose steam once the story begins to flash back, showing dull and uninteresting scenes that feel as if they were only included to get the picture to an hour and a half. These sequences truly drags the movie down as the conversations aren't nearly as compelling, and feel unneeded as they hardly shed any light on the current situation that couldn't have been told through the chafacgers in the werehouse.Ultimately, Reservoir Dogs is passable, and a decent first effort for the genius that is Quentin Tarantino, but it pales in comparison to his later works, as I feel there's nothing here that memorable or interesting."
Sickfrog,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"Quentin Tarantino proved his cinematic genius to the entire film industry with the revolutionary Pulp Fiction. Yet, several years before that, he burst onto the scene with this film, with just as masterful a showcase of solid, colorful ensembles of characters, dramatic empathy for usually unsympathetic archetypes and gory violence subdued and made watchable by mixing a sadistic sense of humor and style into the mix. Michael Madsen delivers one of the most frightening performances ever seen in modern cinema as Mr. Blonde, a devil-may-care sociopath. After watching his most graphic scene, you will never be able to listen to ""Stuck in the Middle With You"" in the same way again. Also, Havey Kietel and Tim Roth give the film its most touching edge, as Kietel's Mr. White develops a very paternal relationship to the mortally-wounded Mr. Orange, creating a trust and honor to protect him at any cost, which is just what he is challenged with. The cast is rounded out with equally remarkable performance by the likes of Steve Buscemi, Chris Penn and Laurence Tierney as this drama eventually hits a crucial peak, leaving you with a climax that won't soon be forgotten, even when listening to the spookily sedate Harry Nillson song ""Coconut"" as the credits roll."
argo0403,"Sep 26, 2013",6/10,"Tarantino made a memorial debut as a director on this, Reservoir Dogs.The story is quite simple describing six robbers who call each other by color. They fail to thieve jewels and become doubtful about each other.I know this movie gains high ratings but compared with Pulp Fiction, this doesn't look as good as that.  Although there're many great directions as ever, for me this lacks refreshment after watching.However, opening scene is cool and talk about ""like a virgin"" makes me laugh. Also, musics are nice. The actors Tarantino chose are always refined. Especially, I like Mr. Orange and Mr. White. Besides, Tarantino himself is attractive!In spite of skillful story-telling by moving axis of time, the important story itself fascinates me so much.  In the middle of the movie, I became bored.Still, there're full of humor and violence. You will be satisfied with them."

Morejambo54,"Mar 15, 2021",6/10,"I did enjoy this movie but I don't think it holds up 29 years later. I liked the middle to end of the movie the most. It held the most exciting scenes and had the least amount of dialogue, which usually is a bad thing but this movie was straight dialogue. The lack of music, although quite eerie made me bored and tired. It gets good when the music does begin to play and the movie begins to feel more relaxed. The twist towards the end, while not anything too unique was exciting and interesting, I'm sure at the time of its release it wouldn't have been seen anywhere. The characters weren't anything special, which was the point, the audience isn't meant to feel sympathy for any of the ""reservoir dogs"" through personal information. This allows the smaller characters that were mixed up in the violence to be the ones we feel for. I liked Mr.Blonde a lot, he was the most interesting of the group and I thought to be the best acted. The beginning is, for me, where the movie falls flat, it was slow and added barely anything to the film as a whole. The scenes where far to long to not have music to fill up the empty space. I can see how this is a masterpiece of a movie, in 1992, not anymore...sorry fans of the movie. 6/10"
victiminvesta,"Mar 28, 2023",5/10,"Well, this one is overrated for sure, but an interesting study of Tarantino's development as a director. It has all his hallmarks - dialogue, ""the speech"", violence, out of sequence narrative. It only lacks Uma Thurman's feet. In fact, it feels like a test run for Pulp Fiction.I guess the idea of a heist movie without showing the heist and ultra violence was novel at the time.What is the main issue? It feels like amateur stage play with characters' lines rather long winded, acting a bit over the top, especially Mr. Pink and Mr. White scenes that take good part of the movie.All in all, I think, cinematically the movie is carried by Mike Madsen and Chris Penn whose characters feel natural and thus more believable.What is this film about? It is about male insecurities and homosexuality. The theme of big dicks and homosexuality is all over the movie. Even starting with their black suits/white shirt/Ray Ban glamour getup. But particularly interplay between chattering Mr. Pink and others and especially between Mr. White and Mr. Orange where it is frankly hysterical.TBH apart from the torture scene and some mildly entertaining but overly prolonged dialogue in the beginning it is a boring movie.One thing struck me tho. There is a scene with Mr. Orange on a roof top. I wonder - had ""Disaster Artist"" famous ""Oh, Hi Mark"" scene been inspired by that one."
george.schmidt,"Apr 21, 2003",N/A,"RESERVOIR DOGS (1992) **** Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi, Lawrence Tierney, Chris Penn, Eddie Bunker, Quentin Tarantino, Steven Wright (Voice over only). Best described as ""Abbott and Costello Meet Sam Peckinpah"", this brutal and brutally black comedy/crime thriller balances sadism with levity, with panache and a taut story line reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's ""The Killing"". Chief thug Tierney calls a group of strangers (all given color coded aliases to avoid any mistrust) for a jewel heist, which goes horribly awry. Some clever camera work by rookie filmmaker/writer Tarantino (who plays one of the crooks in a brief role) and viscerally scary sequences (Madsen's torture of a cop to the tune of Stealer's Wheel's ""Stuck in the Middle with You"" is the cinematic equivelant of rubbernecking at a car wreck; you want to look away but can't) makes this one unique spin on the genre. Keitel and Roth are top notch as the bonding partners in crime as are Buscemi's weasel and psycho Madsen. Wright's voice overs as a disc jockey are hysterical as is the pre-credit dissection of Madonna's ""Like A Virgin"". One of the best independent films ever made."
ssjenkins,"Oct 13, 2022",9/10,"Took a girl to see this at the Glasgow Odean cinema (R. I. P) back in 93ish thinking that it might be a fun movie. Obviously this was before IMDB, and the opening scene changed the whole dynamic of my hopes that night. Never saw the girl again after that . Thanks Tarantino ! :) Anyway. Back to the review. The more I watch it now the more I appreciate it . Pulp Fiction had a bigger impact on me at the time back then. Think I saw that 3 times at the cinema which is a record for me. But I've just watched Reservoir Dogs again today , and as I said before. It's growing on me more and more. I don't think it'll ever surpass Pulp Fiction, but you never know."
bigmoviebuff,"Jun 13, 2001",10/10,"I first found out about this movie through the great Scream series in Scream 2 when randy made some Quentin Tarantino remark and thats when i got into his movies.This movie is just great.There are lots of great comments about this movie, and the one thing i like is that its not over rated.As good as it is it wasnt turned into a big Holly Wood moosh thing like Pulp Ficton. I think this movie shows the power you can have with a gun and a slick mouth.I could never come up with the stuff they said in this movie. So if you think this is over rated and stink, you stink. I may be young but this is still my #2 movie despite all the gore and language most people think think young people should not see.If you have seen ""From Dusk Till Dawn"" you would love this"
markyarsenal2003,"Jun 3, 2008",10/10,"I absolutely love this film and think Quentin is a great writer and director. It is strange people seem to either love or hate Quentin, much like Marmite. Well I hate Marmite but love his films. The dialogue was brilliant along with the screenplay. The actors themselves gave their own little bit of magic to the picture. It may be low budget, but it looks like a $10-15 million budget.The aspect which is the tip of the iceberg for me and what made me on the edge of my seat when I first watched this film back in 1996 is the skipping of one bit of the film to another. A genius idea by Quentin, I think this film doesn't get the praise it rightly deserves.I was so happy to see him make Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown and the Kill Bill series along with Death Proof. His screen play and story writing is also out of this world, for the other films he hasn't directed; True Romance, Natural born Killers, From Dusk Till Dawn.I wish I could rate this 30/10, but I can only rate it as a ten. Shame, keep them coming Quentin.."
becky-92346,"Jan 15, 2023",9/10,"Reservoir Dogs (1992) tells the story of a heist gone wrong, when the surviving criminals start to believe that one of them is a police informant. The film is a classic! A great start to Tarantino's filmography with some brilliant storytelling and equally impressive performances from all the actors.The film is very simplistic in its approach to the cinematography, and this works in it's favour. The colour palettes are very bleak and the deep colour of the blood in certain scenes contrasts well with the minimalist set design. I absolutely adore the use of 360 tracking shots, they really stand out and feel iconic to Tarantino films.The film also takes the simple route with the sound design, and once again, I see this as a positive as it was very effective. There is a prominent lack of score which adds to the unsettling nature and tension the film has. Also, the soundtrack is instantly recognisable and compliments some of the movie's most iconic moments.The movie is packed full of really great performances and the dialogue is snappy and well written, which is why it works so well as a dialogue driven film. Steve Buscemi is brilliant as Mr Pink and Tim Roth as Freddy was perfect casting, he's a very complex and interesting character that's easy to route for. In addition, the actors all have a lot of chemistry with each other and their interactions feel real and natural.The pacing is surprisingly slow, with an intriguing structure, resulting in a high tension watch. I really love that this film isn't in chronological order, this structure allows the film to gradually reveal details that layer the plot up very well. It takes some wild twists and turns and is a blast to watch, ending on a weirdly disturbing and shocking note."
h_ordek,"Dec 27, 2004",6/10,"For a low budget movie, it's remarkable how many great actors have been casted. Harvey Keitel, Steve Buscemi, Tim Roth and Michael Madsen are each worth of what the movie did cost.I didn't really enjoy 'Reservoir Dogs'. First of all, the locations of the movie were a garage, an office and sometimes the street. They were waiting and waiting for help for their wounded friend. This made the movie too boring. They didn't need to be there all the time. And when they left, the viewer stayed in the garage.Those were the disadvantages, but there's one very big advantage for this movie. The lines of the actors. Sometimes I had to laugh about them, and sometimes what they were saying was very serious. This saved the movie, in my opinion. The acting was great too. Especially Michael Madsen impressed me as the silent, but very sadistic hench-man.I give this movie a 6 out of 10. I don't want to join the trend of liking everything Tarantino is doing. Even when it has some serious disadvantages, and certainly when I compare this one with the extremely amusing 'Kill Bill' movies."
adrongardner,"Dec 7, 2005",7/10,"Dogs is a decent movie, but time has not made it better. I like a lot about Reservoir Dogs. The acting is good and even though the movie is small, we get a convincing Tarantino world painted around us. The dialog is good and funny as we expect but some of the writing is a little dry and plotting slow. The aftermath of the robbery and the history of an informant pervade the entire storyline. The limited set pieces keep the movie simple but also show that it was clearly written with a very low budget in mind, as such it feels limited in scope with some probably claiming that is part of the point. Whatever. I think there are a few scenes that are downright boring. Joe and Mr. White's exchange in the office is a snooze but the ""Comode"" soliloquy Roth memorizes to convince his fellow robbers of his authenticity is brilliant. The violence is effective, but not quite affecting. I wanted more cuts, more sets, more plot. Dogs could easily be transplanted to a stage and many times that's where it feels we are watching it, which to me isn't a good thing.On the whole its a great first film of course. If we only view films in the context of the time they were released, ET and Star Wars would never be surpassed in their brilliance, thankfully that is not the case. Dogs is good, but not as Brilliant as Empire magazine and other Dogs zealots would have you believe. My advice? Show the robbery in silence from a black and white security cam at the VERY end with the credits rolling and you have a better movie. I like it, I really do, but its not a Rashomon or Rio Bravo. Reservoir Dogs is a nice Point Blank. Nicely entertaining, convincingly executed and completely ineffectual."
swessels,"May 26, 2000",1/10,"It also has no entertainment value - it was a chore to watch.It's all about stupid people killing each other. The senseless violence is extremely offensive and although I could see the language being typical of the type of person, I found that offensive too.I could have spent my time better lying on my bed watching the ceiling for 99 minutes."
uffe-5,"Mar 10, 2000",N/A,"Even though 'Pulp Fiction' is quite better, 'Reservoir Dogs' tops most movies. Although the acting is so chemical, under it you can see that the team really enjoys to working together. Their teamwork is the main attraction to the movie. But, good acting is not really a savior. The directing, debuting Tarantino, and script, also QT, is what people will refer to as 'the old fashion Tarantino-style'. The movie is soaked up with blood. It is horrible, as in explicit content, but still, in a way cool and quite funny (if you can look closer?).This is simply a gangster movie that is out of the ordernal. 'Reservoir Dogs' doesn't get predictable, from the fact that the story has been rollercoastered around and the scenes are all in a great mess. But that is also a main attraction. I love this movie, because it has got a hidden meaning deep under the very intensive pulse of this gangster-classic.Harvey Keitel and co starring Tim Roth, Steve Buscemi, Michael Madsen, Chris Penn, Lawrence Tierney, Quentin Tarantino and Edward Bunker as the gangsters they would stick up on (nah, not really, but, kind of) are fantastic titles and brings this cult-movie up even higher, as I've said.The absolutely gross torture-scene (Michael Madsen, Kirk Baltz) should nobody miss. It's a classic.Rating: 9/10"
caspermonaxios,"Jun 10, 2023",9/10,"""Reservoir Dogs"" pulls off the elegent trick of creating great amounts of suspense with a story that mostly takes place in a single room. Decades years later, perhaps what stands out most is Tarantino's camera work. There is not a single dull shot in the movie, from the opening scene continuously circulating the breakfast club to the slow-motion Wild Bunch credit sequence. Featuring a tightly braided script, clever directorial style, cracking dialogue and a brilliant cast who truly achieves his picture as morally ambiguous criminals. The film never slows down, and Tarantino makes great use of dozens of long tracking shots. Fantastic movie."
Top_Dawg_Critic,"Jul 13, 2017",9/10,"The inspiring rise of a great and unique director, Quentin Tarantino.If you have or have not seen this amazing film, look for a segment in the trivia on how this was supposed to be a very low budget film, using the video store Quentin Tarantino used to work at as a set, until it got picked up by Harvey Keitel and then moved into a professional production. That alone is an aspiring true story in itself. The rest, is history!Starring Harvey Keitel, Tim Roth, Michael Madsen and Chris Penn, this movie set a new standard for film-making.Certainly belongs in everyone's DVD collection.It's a 9/10 from me."

Since so much will already have been written, applause to those who (hopefully) noticed how Tarantino knew precisely when to turn the lens away from his most gruesome moment of torture - thus intensifying your repulsion. He's a natural.

DzeFrenchman,"Mar 31, 2008",10/10,"This is one of those films you can watch over and over and over again, and never get tired of. Tarantino knows exactly what we want and gives it to us in so many of his films, just like he does in this one. The story (undercover cop ...) has been done so many times, but never it was made like this. How come Tarantino succeeds where others fail? There are lots of reasons, but let me just give you the most important one: the dialogs! They are brilliant brilliant brilliant!!! The movie begins with this one: Mr. Brown's vision on what 'Like a virgin' is all about... geniality! Every word that comes out of Joe, the big boss, is so hilarious! As I'm running out of synonyms for funny etc., I'll stop here. As in all Tarantino's films, the editing is also of a very high level, as is the music, but then again, how could the music possibly be bad: it's K-Billy's Super Sounds of the 70's!!! You can't but love the DJ. And on top of all that, we have the honor to see a top-cast in action. I'm talking 'bout Harvey Keitel, Michael Madsen, Steve Buscemi and I also want to mention Lawrence Tierny (Joe), cause he really made me laugh a lot of times.So, if you're a Tarantino fan, you'll definitely like it. For those unfamiliar with his work: watch it, really, it's the perfect film to get familiar with his style; and it's simply a really great movie."

tkdlifemagazine,"Jan 11, 2023",9/10,"This was Tarantino's first major work and it started an entire genre of filmmaking. This low profile character based, dialogue driven film is masterful. The facts surround a group of thieves getting together for a big score, which goes horribly wrong. Add in the element of a police informant and you have the basis for Reservoir Dogs. While the film has some graphic and shocking moments, it is the elements of character conversation that deeply resonates with the viewer. Through the characters we get a look into the mind of Quentin Tarantino. The film also establishes several elements that will continue in future films, such as Pulp Fiction. In addition to character connections, we see a great attention to details, and the use of a monster soundtrack as an additional character in the tale. This one will always have a special place for me in the Tarantino universe."
TJ_at_the_drive_in,"Nov 16, 2025",10/10,"I can never listen to stuck in the middle with you the same again. In Tarantino's debut feature, we got a heist gone wrong.The dialogue is top notch of course, it's darkly hilarious and it's violent. That's what a Tarantino film is, those 3 things. They always have a great soundtrack and iconic memorable moments. They have plenty of great discussions. There is a lot of talking in this film but that's why the dialogue being top notch is so important. You are entertained by the conversations and it makes you think about your own feelings on the matter.There's several different personalities so you'll find at least one relatable, if not more. There's some cool twists. We get different perspectives of the same story. This is a wild one and I feel bad for anybody that gave up on it too soon because this is an amazing directorial debut."
ametaphysicalshark,"Aug 26, 2009",N/A,"Was that as good for you as it was for me? Not really, Quentin. It launched your career and earned you a lot of fans well before ""Pulp Fiction"" came along, but it's not really all that great. Re-watching a film I'd seen once before in high school should prove interesting, but the movie was basically exactly what I remembered it as. Decent story, good characters, some superb dialogue, but nothing much to recommend as a film. This might have made a great theater production, but Tarantino doesn't create a lively atmosphere with his camera, he doesn't do enough to make this feel cinematic. He's no Mike Nichols on ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?"", that's for sure, but sadly I don't think he even does an okay job with it. The movie is dead, dull to look at. Cheap-looking even. But yeah, some great conversations, but that's pretty much it. I'm not a big fan, and certainly don't understand this one's rep."
bob_blank,"Dec 5, 2001",6/10,"Pulp Fiction was good. I have no qualms with Tarantino himself, seems like an interesting guy. But this movie...how did it ever make it on the top 250? Many people seem to like it and that's fine, go right ahead, but I found it to be fairly uninteresting and incomplete. Just a lot of talking, cursing, and the occasional bit of shooting. Oh, and the 'ear-cutting' thing really is not as appalling and disturbing as people like to say it is. Believe me, there's a lot of movies with a LOT more disturbing stuff than that, people.My score - 6/10. Not the worst movie, but doesn't deserve the attention it's getting."
V Hanna,"Jul 22, 1999",10/10,"This movie is better than Pulp Fiction. Let's get that straight right now. I have seen it a number of times and it just keeps getting better. The story line is fresh, the casting perfect, camera shots are unique, and the sound bites original. Oh yea, the soundtrack is great too. Six guys commit a robbery and you don't even see it. You spend the whole movie watching the planning of the caper and the turmoil afterwards. Harvey Keitel may have given his best performance of his career and Steve Buscemi is a classic. In fact it's Buscemi's 'Mr. Pink' (there is a great line in response to his disapproval to the color pink) weasel character that I feel is the gasoline in the Reservoir Dogs engine. He represents the voice of reason and clear thinking on one point and sneaky and scheming on the other. Michael Madsen's 'Mr. Blonde' was made for him. Tim Roth 'Mr. Orange' has his ground breaking role (I can't say what as because it ruins part of the plot). Chris Penn and Lawrence Tierney are perfect as the father son mob team. What is really great about this movie is the dialog. Some of the best ever and truly original. The dialog in Reservoir Dogs flows so smoothly and naturally that it gives a more than a movie feel to it. For example the part in the bathroom with the cops standing around talking was beautiful because that is how how cops chit chat to each other about who's butt they busted or how stupid this guy was. Tarantino even had the cops talking about it with that kind of smirky ego locker room talk. That and having Roth break in and continue his description of the story right there was great. Also, the opening scene is a bona fide classic. The Madonna speech, the discussion on tipping, everything about that was great dialog. I also love the way Madsen and Keitel go back and forth at one point in the movie (""I bet you're a big Lee Marvin fan""). If you haven't seen the movie yet be prepared because it jumps around between past and present like 'Godfather 2'. But, that is also part of the genius of it. It's bloody, so if you hate violence go rent a Disney movie instead and save yourself from stopping a great movie and complaining that this is what causes violence in youths. Wrong (that's another argument I won't get into but we can't make every movie for 10 year olds and if they happen to get a hold of it where were you when they did!). Reservoir Dogs goes on the classic list. It's a top of the shelf action movie with dark comedy and great lines to boot. One word of advice to Mr. Tarantino, stop putting yourself in your movies. You are not an actor! Stick to directing where you do your best work."
jaydin725,"Feb 19, 2007",7/10,"I was very excited to see this movie on the IFC listings because I had been aware of all the praise it had received for sometime. This movie is very well written and has a somewhat interesting plot.Steve Buscemi was excellent as well as the other actors, but with all the hype over the film I was expecting something more. I found it quite overrated. All the praise over this movie is misleading. It is also a matter of taste to whether you would like it or not. If you enjoy films about organized crime that lack no violence then it is a classic. If you are more into movies like Office Space or Garden State you might hate this film. Personally I think it is a quality film, but it has a deceptive hype."

Pjtaylor-96-138044,"May 14, 2018",8/10,"'Reservoir Dogs (1992)' is remarkably restrained for a Tarantino flick, a stripped-back thriller focusing on the tense aftermath of a robbery gone wrong. It's incredibly compelling throughout, with snappy dialogue driving character-based brilliance. The movie doesn't hang about, running around 99-minutes, and, as such, the limited premise is milked for every ounce of suspense before an explosive finale. 8/10"
luckynutjob,"Dec 7, 2022",10/10,"From the moment this starts I was on the edge of my seat, what this man pulls with this non-chronological storytelling is just delightful, keeping you hungry, intrigued, hooked, absolutely immersed in the story.Dialogues are clever, the characters are alive, the violence is gut wrenching and beautifully delivered.After watching the trailer I was caught off guard by the fact that the heist isn't shown much, if at all, but there's no need, as it paints a clear picture of what went down in your head, the flow is so good you're not ever given much time to think about anything other than what's in front of your face. Intense, gory, just great."
