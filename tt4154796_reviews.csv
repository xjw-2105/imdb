0U,"Feb 15, 2020",8/10,"There isn't too much in the way of suspense or surprises when it comes to the story, but there are some shocking moments and funny lines in this epic finale. Again, like many of the best Marvel films, the holes and flaws are covered up with humor and fan service, making everything okay. That being said, I did prefer Infinity War to this film, which really misses the leads of the other Marvel franchises that were ""snapped"" out. Overall, however, there are only a few ways you can wrap up the main story of the MCU, and this was a solid direction."
aryonda,"Apr 30, 2019",7/10,"I cried and laughed and blah, blah, blah. CGI was great, but I can't get past all the subtext to create plot rules and then completley blow them put of the water. I can think of about 5 minutes of scenes and a slightly different way to handle the last moments of the battle that would have covered those holes. I can't believe no one said ""Hang on a minute. This wont work."""
ritchiep-56574,"Apr 26, 2019",10/10,"First review from me. This film deserves it. A superhero film, marvel or not, does not have the right to send me on the emotional rollercoaster that End Game did. It has no right to do what it did, paying tribute to 10 years of films whilst changing the rules as to what a superhero film should be.I laughed, lots.
I cried, lots.
I cheered (quietly and internally of course), lots
I even punched the air in a ""go on!"" during one sceneI can honestly say, no film has ever moved me like that. Hours later, my heart was still pounding, the adrenaline still flowing from this epic piece of film making.Made by fans, for fans. Are there flaws? Yes. If you over think the story of course there is. But it works. It flows. It fits.Go with it. Enjoy the ride.Soak up every second, it doesn't feel like 3 hours, it feels like a flow of story reaching a conclusion that will shock and move you.I have nothing else to say.10/10. Well done Russo brothers. Well done!Fans! Assemble!"
davyjones-636363,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"This film is an emotional rollercoaster with some of the coolest superhero plot lines ever drawn up. It's straight up the most epic Marvel film that will probably ever be created. I don't see how Marvel could ever top this, but getting to see these characters all together at least one last time was a reward all on its own."
eandros-77451,"Apr 26, 2019",10/10,"Thank you Marvel, End Game is an ending that give me speechless."
dhiraj-yahoo,"May 8, 2019",10/10,"After watching Infinity war, I was looking forward to much more this time, still a perfect ending."
miniminnie-23063,"Sep 25, 2021",10/10,As always avengers didn't disappoint even with a few loops or inconsistencies. Hope marvel does more movies about some characters from avengers.
larshoeijmans,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"If you're going to watch this movie, avoid any spoilers, even spoiler free reviews.
Which is why I'm not going to say anything about the movie. Not even my opinion. All I'm going to say is:The crowd applauded 3 times during the movie, and stood up to clap their hands after. This I have never witnessed in a Dutch cinema. Dutch crowds aren't usually passionate about this. I checked the row where I was sitting, and people were crying. After the movie, I was seeing people with smudged mascara. That's all I have to say about the movie."
ahmetkozan,"Apr 25, 2019",10/10,"After Avengers Infinity War, we waited for the Avengers Endgame. We wondered how the story would go on, how our heroes would turn back, what would be the end of Thanos. Many theories related to this have been put forward. Avengers Endgame was undoubtedly the most anticipated film of recent years. Normally, the higher the expectation, the higher the probability of disappointment. But this is not the case for Endgame. Whatever you're expecting, you find much more in the film. This means that the biggest concern about the film has disappeared.On the other hand, another comparison comes up. Is Endgame more successful than Infinity War? We can comfortably say it Avengers Infinity War is just the beginning of the story. Endgame was the finale of the story. So we shouldn't think of these two films as two separate stories. There is only one story divided into two parts.Avengers Endgame is, above all, a great homage to the ten-year history of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story highlights the original Avengers team. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye are at the center of events. No character comes in front of them. Of course there are many characters that play an important role in the story outside the original Avengers team. Everyone's concern was that Captain Marvel, who was included in the Marvel world, overshadowed other heroes. We can say that this certainly did not happen. What is important in this struggle is not how strong you are, but how good you are. This comes to the fore in all areas. It gives good message about being a hero and a family.Of course, Avengers Endgame has some critical aspects. For example, is the three-hour period necessary in terms of the story? It can be discussed. The head of the story moves much slower than the rest. It also drags the heroes into an emotional predicament. Then the tempo is rising and the heavy scenes we are watching are getting more meaningful. The last 45 minutes of the movie is fully action packed. But the last 45 minutes goes so fast that you don't even realize it. Action and battle scenes are really successful. There is not even a slight distress about visual effects. There are also slight logic errors in the film, but in general the story is so successful that these details become meaningless and insignificant after a certain point.Lastly, Avengers Endgame doesn't have a movie end scene. Because after the film's final, there is no need for another scene. The Marvel legend Stan Lee appears with a small stage. But this is the last surprise scene in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Moreover, there is no clue about Marvel's future. This makes us wonder more about Spider-Man: Far from Home. 10/10"
CriticalThinking2,"Apr 30, 2019",6/10,"After Infinity War I had huge expectations. Unfortunately I think it doesn't follow the comic book at all because they wanted some kind of closure of the story.
I saw a lot of 10 star reviews and I cannot believe the majority of people like this movie more than Infinity War.
I'm not saying it wasn't entertainment to watch but the feeling is that all heroes were forced to fit in a movie paying a big price to the story.
There are moments in the movie where the rules from all other Marvel movies are broken and characters which were build over hours of screen time were reduced in order to make space for others.
The story is average at best with big flaws."
vert2712,"Apr 24, 2019",9/10,"I feel like I'm wasting my time writing down my thoughts about Avengers: Endgame, because nothing I (or any critic) could say about it would ever dissuade a prospective viewer from seeing it. But after having had the chance to watch it at a preview screening, I can't help but say a few spoiler-free words.I'm not your average fanboy -- most long-running franchises have bored me at this point, and I couldn't care less about the newest Star Wars episode or whether there will be another film set in the Harry Potter universe.But Marvel films have been consistently watchable, with many solid entries and a few great ones (Winter Soldier, Ragnarok, the first Guardians of the Galaxy among others). And after Infinity War ended with a cliffhanger, I was looking forward to the conclusion. Boy, was I not disappointed!Very few highly-anticipated movies live up to the hype, but Avengers: Endgame is one of them. It's the perfect follow up to Infinity War, and the absolute zenith of the Marvel franchise. It's hard to see how they'll be able to top this one.It's surprisingly inventive (even when you know where the story is headed, the plot takes a few tangents getting there), emotionally engaging (a few people were crying in the theater) and surprisingly funny (this is probably the most I've laughed in a Marvel film since Thor: Ragnarok). Visually speaking, it's a true spectacle (topping Infinity War in the 'epic battle' stakes), and even though it's three hours long, it doesn't feel bloated. The only times I glanced at my watch was because I was hoping there would be more time before the end.Yes, it's a superhero movie, but an immensely entertaining one (especially for fans who have seen all the pictures that came before it: there are tons of references and inside jokes to reward the faithful).If ""Return of the King"" managed to win Best picture at the 2003 Oscars Avengers: Endgame deserves at least a nomination. It's as good (and in many ways better) a conclusion to a fantasy/genre series as the Peter Jackson film,.Go see it."
S_QCP,"Jun 28, 2019",N/A,"I expected so much from this film but just feel so disappointed by it. A poor and incoherent story with so many contradictions within it plus a total waste of my favourite character - amongst others (like Thanos himself). I did go and rewatch it in the cinema a second time and realised that, without all the excitement and expectation I went in with the first time I was just really really bored.It did have some nice ""moments"", especially the anticipated big fight towards the end. Some characters get a good inning - love Antman and, of course, Iron Man but this is my least favourite MCU film.And the ending...........sigh!"
stevealfieholmes,"May 8, 2019",10/10,"Indulgent rubbish. Do yourself a favor and just watch infinity war because this film is boring and by the end, I just did not care anymore!"
rjcattermole,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,Avengers: Endgame is above all the best Marvel superhero movie to date. This is also the best and epic conclusion to the 21 movies in the first 10 years of the MCU. This is the epic culmination. The best storytelling ever told.
monks_89,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Unbelievable. For Marvel to pull this tour de force of a film is unreal. 21 films. 21 films culminating in the conclusion of endgame. The scope is incredible, I will only say it's definitely one of the best Marvel films out there, and there are many. I don't want to spoil anything. Watch it!"
jaacy-84600,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"I laughed , cried and was speechless. 3 hours well used. It was a perfect ""ending"" of the Avenger Movies.
I will watch it again and again and again. 10 points well deserved!!!"
ben6464,"May 1, 2019",6/10,Problem with time travel is if your not careful you make the whole plot impossible to believe. End game doesn't even come close to tieing up its loose ends. The remaining avengers act selfishly and arragently to the point you want them to fail.Thanos did nothing wrong. I hated this film.
laughingsaint66,"Aug 2, 2019",N/A,How did I not recognize Karen Gillan as nebula !! Funny at times otherwise kinda ridiculous
PaceOfChange,"Apr 29, 2019",8/10,"The Russo Brothers will be forever known as the directors that failed a franchise and insulted the very fans that embraced it.I have no idea why they felt their finished product would pay homage to Stan Lee's legacy or the characters he brought to life but this ""closure"" to a decade of greatness was, in fact, the most disappointing 3-hours of character assassination in cinematic history."
Mardolin,"Apr 24, 2019",8/10,"Don't get me wrong, the movie was great, but would I watch it a second time? Probably not - until the DVD comes out.I've seen infinity war at least 5 times, and it's one of my favorite films.That being said, i will compare the two movies for sure, and I just disliked the pacing, it was all over the place. Some Characters felt off, and some got little to no screen time, where others had too much.It's just too many characters for one movie, even though infinity war did it much better, with just as many characters. I just can't put my finger on it.The fighting scenes were alright, the first half lacked action, but the second half delivered some good solid scenes, nothing groundbreaking, but fun to watch. They can't reinvent the wheel, neither do they want to. They stick to what works, and that's alright.All in all, the movie was a close 8/10, the fanboys who give it a 10 are just blind to accept the mistakes the movie made. It's not a perfect film, even an 8 is really generous in my opinion. The Movie works with nostalgia and gives fans of the MCU the things they wanted, more or less.Still thinking Thor 3 was the best MCU movie. Sue me."
thomasdekoning1996,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,This movie proves the Russo brothers are in a league of their own when it comes to closing a franchise this big. In my opinion they pulled of the most satisfying ending this story arc could have.It's nothing without its previous 21 movies. Must watch for every movie fan.
ymyuseda,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Rating 10/10
Absolute perfection end game !! Good acting performance to all the characters. Great cgi's. Truly epic & perfect ending to a long journey of marvel movie. Go see it you wont regret it !! Perfection Marvel Endgame !!"
dummykenmen,"Apr 28, 2019",10/10,"I loved how the story of the Infinity War was conceived. With all the fight scenes and the emotional aspect of the movie, especially the end part, everything was superb. But this is supposed to be a wrap-up film. The directors and writers just destroyed it all. What's the point of doing a hype over Captain Marvel for this movie when you just give her a few minutes of screen time? It would be forgiven if you give her an amazing fight with the villain during the climax. But what have you done? With just a few kicks and punches and that's it. It doesn't give a scratch over Thano's face. What a crap!!!You also ruin Hulk! He is supposed to be the strongest Avenger after the events of Infinity War, after all the disappointment and frustration he has experienced when Hulk won't face Thanos. But this time, he's just as good as nothing Avenger. I wonder why they did not give Thanos and Hulk a fight of a lifetime. I'm really surprised that they did not even get face-to-face when all hell breaks loose.This movie is dubbed as an action movie but got 75% of the time talking and mumbling.There's no justice at all to those beloved characters and this movie. You have ruined my expectations."
sebastianjohnayres,"May 4, 2019",6/10,"Honestly felt like a completely different film from Avengers Infinity War. In fact the film had such a different tone from all the Marvel films before.The characters changed, the story line was poor. Incredibly disappointing end to phase three"
ravi2445,"May 12, 2019",9/10,"Right in the beginning, you know how the movie is going to end...the good guys are going to win. How anti-climactic that was.. The stage is not set right (half of all humanity is gone, but the enormity of that is not explored...)...when you have Thanos give his explanation as to why he did what he did, I found myself thinking - well, he actually has a point.
In the meanwhile, every single superhero is given time to fight, say some cute things, some say a few smart things, a few even manage to say profoundly philosophical statements...
The quantum physics explanations used to explain how things are done, are plainly non sense... ..they just made stuff up as they went on.
Alls well that ends well. Except we spent 3 hours to find that out."
james-84287,"Apr 30, 2019",8/10,I went in with the highest expectations and came out underwhelmed and disappointed. its nowhere near as good as infinity war !!!

Snowraven69,"Sep 2, 2019",9/10,"The dumbing down of Hulk and ruining his character by turning him into an utter wimp, turning Thor into a bumbling drunkard, really? Well done Disney on ruining yet another couple of hero's characters (See Luke Skywalker and Yoda in Disney's Last Jedi for extra confirmation of this) That's all I've got to say about this movie."
Random789,"May 13, 2019",N/A,Just a basic superhero movie. 3 hours but not much going on.
shiz-174-875258,"May 4, 2019",10/10,Probably one of the worst Avengers movie to date. The plot was extremely childish and did not make sense. Completely went astray from the plot described in the comics. Very disappointed...
prarthanabackup,"Oct 29, 2024",10/10,"This movie feels more like a culmination of all the Marvel movies. A perfect closing to the MCU uptil that point. It brings back all the major characters and settings throughout the whole Marvel franchise. Talking about the movie after almost 5 years even today I get goosebumps. It marks the end of a few main characters that will literally drive any Marvel fan to tears. The plot revisits a few great Marvel moments from earlier movies literally bringing in a wave of nostalgia. The film has remarkable action, splendid visual effect, moving musical score and an even greater emotional weight. Kudos to the actors, directors, writers and the whole team for making such an awesome movie that has left a profound impact on our generation. This movie will always remain special to me."
Unactive12345,"Mar 25, 2021",10/10,The Most Overrated Movie Of All Time. (Will Always be the Most Overrated and most Forgettable Movie Of all Time.)
mikekutsykh,"Apr 26, 2019",8/10,Absolutely strange how they could cut so strong first part of Avengers and spoil the second one! All dialogues are weak and absurd same as a few plot lines. The last 5 minutes of the film is all-around failure!
ericbaez26-953-178828,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Basically the title. Left me speechless. I was probably too hyped to the point of annoyance but it broke my massive expectations to the point that I'm watching it again 2 more times this weekend. It leaves you at the edge of your seat and the 3rd act is just insane and a masterpiece. Infinity War was fantastic but this is insanity, in all the right ways. The best series finale that I hoped it would be and then some."

Susisgud,"May 5, 2019",8/10,"It's a long film at 3 hours the last one being better because this concludes the 10 year story in at great and satisfying way. The first 2 hours are build up that is ultimately paid off but I felt the middle dragged on I just wanted to get to the end. Infinity war kept me interested the whole time, more than endgame. It's definitely worth the whatch and after you don't have to worry about spoilers.8/10."

portolourenco,"May 4, 2019",8/10,"This is my own opinion, but so many things that didn't make sense in that movie... like so much stuff that could've been utilised in a better way and so many stupid things that were put on wrong hands. The image and the graphics are really good but the plot is weak.

constantinejack,"May 1, 2019",N/A,"I think Marvel films are fine, I understand loving them I really do. Spider-Man 2 is my personal favourite, but please stop giving these movies a 10/10. Endgame is a 7 at best. It's probably the most flawed Avengers film story wise. It's popcorn fun, but it's like if we let Fast & Furious or Transformers films in the top 250. Meanwhile 2001: A Space Oddisey is lower than Infinity War."

berestov,"Mar 17, 2025",10/10,"It's funny to remember the reviews from 6 years ago in which someone talked about such a thing as a fan service. You see, going through some key events, meeting old versions/characters is a fanservice.Where are these commentators now, when literally all of Marvel's +-watchable projects are filled with fanservice? The rest are just bad and uninteresting.I don't understand any complaints. All the characters reach their peak of development and do the things they need for themselves. And the main villain manages to lose 2 times in 3 hours.Although repeated viewings do not give the same sensations as during the cinema premiere, I have a good memory, so I don't see any point in underestimating after a while. Few films can personally give me emotions of the same level. Maybe there won't be any more of them..."
leopineda-92600,"Sep 20, 2020",N/A,"Extremely overhyped movie, loved by marvel fanboys only. Its insulting to say that its the best movie ever, if that was the case, human race would have failed and we all should be killed by a meteor."
willtownsend-59710,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Avengers: Endgame is the final film to the Infinity saga in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The story is emotional, unpredictable, unforgettable, complex and intense. The story does continue on right after infinity war had finsihed, and I thought it was a good way too start because the characters can give you an understanding of how they are feeling. How much loss they have witnessed.
During the three hour film, you care so much for the characters that it makes you want them to live through the whole time, leaving with no casualties. The acting by the cast is outstanding, none of their lines sounded cheesy. Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr especially. The audience has never seen the two characters shine so bright and powerful over the last 11 years. The visuals are the most impressive, it is shown to be Oscar worthy and you would be hungry for more as the film continues on. The final battle was the bomb, the mother of all battles, better then Ready Player One's finale. It's so big and all of it fits in perfectly. Avengers Endgame is the perfect finale that has been set up over the last 11 years. Its a rewatchable film and you will never see the characters the same way as you have seen them from the past films."

andregezz,"Aug 6, 2023",10/10,"I just watched the Avengers movies and some of the infinity saga and I truly think this is a great movie, the CGI and acting were wonderful and the ending was truly a masterpiece and was probably the best ending for a movie saga (don't quote me on this). There are some low points but they are they don't effect the true rating which is a ten, this movie deservers the 8.4. Or an 8.5, I kinda have a bias. Cause i grew up with the marvel movies specifically Iron Man and stuff but the bias does not effect my rating. I live it and many others love it as well i regard this the end 0of the entire mcu from Iron Man - No Way Home, the other multiverse movies are mid and are very odd."
0maro0,"May 9, 2019",N/A,"Let's be clear - there was a lot of talking about this film, about how great it will be. Turned out? It was a pretty decent story about time traveling (I honestly like those). I even thought I like it, aside from some little things that don't even worth mentioning. But the ending - oh, let me talk about the ending. It is so horrible that it erased any good impression this movie could've left. I don't have the problem with how it ends, with events presented. I have the problem with how boring, non-aesthetic and amateur it was filmed. I'm furious that funeral scene turned out to be such a cheap vulgarity, such an emptiness that tries to play with viewer's emotions - and, sadly, fails. This is what the character died for? To be honored... With this? Boy, oh boy. I don't know how many people actually like this scene, but I sure do not.
Also - diversity. As a commercial product in the first place, a movie about diverse characters, well, completely non-diversed. Heteronormative, I would say, and in 2019 it is quite anachronistic. Quite obvious, of course, that the company is afraid of possible risks and profit losses - another reason to think about what good such soulless capitalistic approach can give us? From where I stand, nothing good. I don't want to be a consumer, I want to be a viewer that is not treated like a money account. Anyway, I was bitter about it just a little - after all, what can you expect from Marvel and Russos, really? They are not Taika Waititi after all (how honestly great it would be if Taika Waititi filmed all Avengers movies is story for another time), so even queer-coding isn't present. What got me furious is that Russo had the nerves to actually say they included LGBT-representation there. Leaving alone term ""LGBT-representation"" and why I have problems with this phrasing, let's see what we have here. And what we have, fellow viewers who don't enjoy tasteless similarity in their films, is a huge slap on our faces and our egos. This is what we can call a proper representation these days? I doubt it. It's so elusive I even didn't noticed it in the first place, thinking that the man could be talking about any people from his family. So, if I can read a text hermeneutically and headcanon some queer characters in there, does that mean a film has representation in it? Or, more important, does it mean director has the right to be bragging about such representation? Last one - certainly not."

I loved this movie, it was an emotional rollercoaster from open to close, and a fitting way to pay tribute to the legend of Stan Lee."
Marjuk_Ocean,"Sep 20, 2023",10/10,"""Avengers: Endgame"" - A Spectacular Culmination of Marvel's Cinematic UniverseEndgame is more than just a movie - it's the big, emotional payoff we'd been waiting for after over a decade of Marvel stories. From the very start, it hits you with the weight of what happened in Infinity War, but instead of rushing to the action, it takes its time, letting you feel everything.Every character gets their moment to shine. Tony Stark's journey comes full circle in a way that's heartbreaking and perfect. Steve Rogers? His ending feels like a warm hug to everyone who followed his story from day one. And the final battle... it's pure goosebumps. Every hero you've ever cheered for charging into the fight - it's impossible not to yell at the screen.The Russo brothers nailed the balance between epic action, gut-punch emotions, and those little bits of Marvel humor that make it all feel real. The soundtrack soars, the visuals are mind-blowing, and the crowd-pleasing moments are unforgettable.It's not just fan service - it's the ultimate thank-you letter to the fans. Endgame doesn't just wrap up the Infinity Saga, it sends it off in the most satisfying, tear-jerking, fist-pumping way possible.Verdict: A perfect finale. You'll laugh, cry, and probably rewatch it immediately."

shyam142012,"Apr 30, 2019",9/10,There are so many ways that the movie could have gone. But it is chosen to be this way. So the climax should not be criticised. The story is completed with no proper explanation for the rest of the avengers. Other avengers are not given importance in most of the places. Don't go to the movie if you know the spoilers. My experience has been spoiled by my friends.
craigearl,"Jun 22, 2019",8/10,"Loved Endgame but with a lukewarm feeling for The Eternals and Shang Chi on the horizon, I wondered whether the MCU should make more logical choices for the next phase. Obviously there are development issues with the FF and X-Men franchises and DC's Aquaman may well scupper a potential Sub-Mariner movie, but perhaps these would work:1) Captain Britain (we heard 'Braddock' mentioned by Peggy Carter in Endgame; Brian's father perhaps?)
2) Alpha Flight. With the Avengers having run their course, perhaps their Canadian counterparts could step up. It stands to reason that other countries would want to copy the Avengers model (I know they are the Earth's protectors but they pretty much belong to the USA).
3) Moon Knight. Although I would love to see Daredevil done right on the big screen, maybe Marc Spector could fill the void.
4) Silver Surfer. Norrin Radd was the best thing about the FF sequel. A space-based movie would give him room to soar. Look to GotG or the Ron Lim Thanos issues of Silver Surfer for inspiration.
5) Ka-Zar. Although often perceived as a Tarzan rip-off, Lord Kevin Plunder's exploits could open up a whole new playground with the Savage Land.I wonder if we'll look back in 10 years and see if any of these came to pass...!"
davidkog,"May 1, 2019",8/10,"I'm a huge fan of long slow-crawl movies (cue LOTR trilogy) but the first half of this culminating slog was way too slow and artificially melodramatic. This is in stark contrast to Infinity War's well edited, if not somewhat fractured fast paced scenes.If anything Infinity War could of used an extra 20min of dialogue and slower pacing edited out of Endgame. In the end, still a fun movie but not without obvious pacing flaws."
sajakram,"Jun 14, 2019",7/10,I don't really know what all the hype is about. Bored watching this as it's the same again just rehashed. Glad to see the back of the Avengers to be honest.
tatbtsisb,"Oct 16, 2019",9/10,"Endgame is certainly one of its kind. A movie that will be marked as the film of this decade. Building up from Iron Man to Captain Marvel, a 10 journey filled with joy, adventure and tears. And we need a perfect ending to all of that. Endgame is the perfect ending. A movie that has everything a fan will ever dream of, an amazing cast and a wonderful climax. It is such a huge payoff from 10 years worth of building up. To look at this from a Fan's perspective, it is an awesome movie and it is a masterpiece. But to look at this from a critic's perspective, it is not the best movie. It certainly lacks some elements to a perfect movie. But this to me, is such a wonderful movie and I definitely loved it. It has everything I wanted and I'm gonna give this movie a 9/10."
rgpaeplrp,"Jul 5, 2025",8/10,"Okay so Avengers- Endgame is the grand finale of the Marvel saga and, not gonna lie, it hits hard. Like, it's three hours long but somehow still feels like a sprint through your entire emotional range. Sad. Epic. Kinda hilarious. Then sad again. Then Captain America does something that made everyone in my theater scream like they just saw God. The plot? The Avengers are all depressed after Thanos did his big ""Snap"" thing and wiped out half of everything. So they go on a time-travel mission that's like a Marvel highlight reel on steroids. If you've seen the other movies, it's peak nostalgia. If you haven't, good luck understanding anything. Robert Downey Jr. And Chris Evans carried the emotional weight of the universe. Tony's arc? Brutal. Cap's ending? Chef's kiss. Also, the final battle? Bonkers. Like, every single Marvel character shows up and it's chaos in the best possible way. It made a bajillion dollars, broke every record ever, and people still talk about it like it's the Super Bowl of movies. It kind of was. Would recommend - just, maybe watch the other 21 movies first or you'll be very confused and also dead inside."
Alpharoll,"Aug 6, 2019",7/10,"I had to take several breaks, walk the dogs, play videogames and clean the house, while watching this absolutely ridiculous and nonsensical pile of rubbish and now afterwards, I'm asking myself why I put myself through such suffering. To what end. I guess I was hoping there would be one scene or at least one line that put a smile on my face or made me feel anything at all except extreme pain and boredom. There wasn't any of that unfortunately, so I just wasted three hours of my life I could have spent on basically anything else and it would have been more worth while. I can't decide which one was more painful to watch, this or Aquaman? Both equally and utterly disappointing I guess."
stefanvass,"Apr 26, 2019",7/10,"...and pull the hype train over.
Amazing fun, stunning spectacle great performances especially RDJ.
It's just not the whole sum of its parts.
Lots of great parts but not cohesively held.
Too much Comedy with one character essentially now just full comedy relief.
The most ridiculous coincidences and a couple of plot holes.
You will laugh, you will get gut punched and for some you will cry, but then you will wonder what really happened in that 3 hours.
Did it need 3 hours? No.
Is it better than infinity war? No.
Will you enjoy it? Definitely."

Stream2BigScreen_Movie_Reviews,"Jan 7, 2020",10/10,"Let's talk about the enormity of this film and what Marvel just accomplished.First, this movie did not disappoint. It is very hard to contemplate a movie that will ever have as much or more anticipation than Endgame. Just think about the build up of this film. From May 2008 to April 2019, Marvel, in 21 films, introduced heroes, villains, plots, side plots, family members, love interests and countless Easter eggs that culminated into this film.Second, in a movie full with 10+ main characters, Marvel did an unbelievable job featuring each one and staying true to the characters we've all fallen in love with. This point could easily be a thesis paper for a doctoral candidate. The development and story arcs of characters, individually and collectively, in the midst of struggle and triumph is nothing short of amazing. The attention to detail and thoughtful craftsmanship is true artwork. One knock fans may have is the forced fandom moments. We have so many beloved characters but these moments comes as certain team-up pairings during the big fight that are great but also forced and stereotypical.Lastly, this movie is beauty in motion. Mainly, the movie looks and sounds wonderful. If there is one knock against the movie, the final fight at points was too dark for some of the characters. Otherwise, the final fight displays exactly what many of the DC movies have failed with, Hero power display. Marvel did such a great job of making you feel every punch, kick, hammer throw but also made you feel like you were in motion with each character (thus why I believe 4D would be very good). The sound editing is very good and the song selections in this movie help the viewers follow the emotional roller-coaster ride everyone believes they are in for.Marvel created near perfection for fans (or a near perfect ending). And the ending of this movie, isn't even technically the finish to Phase 3 of their universe. That would be Spider-man: Homecoming coming soon. Phase 4 and 5 are also already in the works. Everyone that was a part of this movie and the first 3 phases should be applauded, but their work is not yet done because for those with the greatest power comes great responsibility."
lukag99,"Apr 24, 2019",9/10,"The first 50 minutes set up the movie very well but the second act lacks urgency and focus. The movie comes to a halt and feels as if it's meandering between scenes, not knowing what to do and not being very entertaining. The movie is also highly predictable and somewhat ruins Thanos's character due to a strange character decision. Iron man is given a lot to work with, which is compelling, same with Hawkeye. The ending is somewhat satisfying but also cringe. Overall it is a fine movie, not offensively bad but certainly not as good as it's predecessor."
angelmriam,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"This movie past over and beyond any expectation. Don't miss watching it..... will definitely watch it again and again. ""Endgame"" The name fits perfectly.
Total respect"
P97,"May 2, 2019",10/10,"It's every marvel fans dream come to reality, people can nip pick the time travel but that's not really a flaw because they done it right by giving the fans what they want, the movie has lot of fan services but it never hurts the plot it actually helps it and it shows how much the russo brothers cared about this universe, by time the movie ends you feel like a life time has past, the end of an era."
thevances,"May 6, 2019",6/10,"Enjoyable movie that takes to long to get into the action and doesn't make any sense once you step back and think about what they've done. Even their explanations on what they were going to do, what they did do, and the final outcomes make no sense. I believe the world would be an even bigger mess when they were done, and Steve broke all the rules!"
awesomeguy_92,"Apr 29, 2019",N/A,"I don't know why people are calling it the best Marvel movie till date. Come on guys did you not watched infinity war. To be honest, that was the greatest movie and this was no way near that. It has so many loopholes and extra scenes, I don't know what Russo brothers were thinking. It got lucky just because of all the buildup that the previous movies made, otherwise it would have end up just like justice league."
locutus-08917,"Apr 26, 2019",8/10,This film was hyped so much i couldn't wait to watch it....the film is good but i didnt get the wow factor i had when i watched infinity war.....all the trailers and the online leaks wasted the ending for me....i still love marvel movies and will go see every one that comes out but for me this was good but not as good as I/W
ni-cole-andrews,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,This movie has the absolute perfect balance of fan service and harsh moments. Lean into the tears and suspend a little disbelief. This movie is everything we needed and more than we deserved.
vandykeu,"Aug 17, 2019",8/10,"Endgame is a great popcorn action movie to ""finish"" a saga of popcorn action movies. This isn't serious entertainment and shouldn't be considered as such, and it reminds me of how George Lucas made Star Wars as an homage to the cheap serials like Flash Gordon. Especially as comic-sourced material, this is what the MCU is. Some part of me is actually a bit pained to like it as much as I do, given that it is just playing on base emotions to make money for a massive conglomerate like Disney.BUT... what a great way to end several major storylines that they invested in over the past 11 years. For people who have watched the saga, I feel like this is just the cherry on the top. My only complaint is something that you can't really get away from in superhero stories: the character ""powers"" are totally inconsistent from scene to scene, and movie to movie. This is a trope that there's no getting away from, because if characters like Captain Marvel, Thor, Scarlet Witch, and Hulk were always as powerful as they show flashes of, then the story wouldn't even be a thing. Any one of them could destroy Thanos in the blink of an eye, and have done similar feats in other stories (and even in other scenes within a given story). That they sometimes ""reduce"" their power to a lower level, without an explained mechanism, is pretty laughable, and makes some parts of the story a bit nonsensical. Yes, this constant Ex Machina is needed to maintain the drama and keep the plot going, but it's still something that takes me out of the story.What I really love about this movie, and the saga as a whole, is how good it is at developing the actual characters and their relationships. There are some similarities, but nobody is the same, and most of the arcs are believable. Thor's story, and apparent PTSD, is to me the best-done, but all of the majors (and some of the minors) are almost as good. I believed them. And for a popcorn action movie saga based on a comic series, I think that's a pretty high compliment."
sergiofabian_20,"May 4, 2019",8/10,I didn't like the acting. Thanos doesn't seem like the badass of the first movie
michaeltong-29180,"Aug 8, 2019",9/10,"Wow there are so many troll reviews by inarticulate rubes who can't even explain their opinions.People are entitled to their own tastes, and the super hero genre of the Marvel variety that is a pastiche of action/adventure, sci-fi, and fantasy doesn't appeal to everyone, but for what it is, for what it succeeds at being for its target audience, Avengers: Endgame is currently the benchmark as a satisfying grand finale in a cinematic universe.There can be no doubt that Infinity War and Endgame are masterpieces. That doesn't mean they're the best movies ever made, or that they're better than other masterpieces of different genres, it just means that it succeeds in every element required of it.The barrier of entry to The Avengers, especially the last two films, is quite high and requires someone to watch a lot of movies, and without an investment in those characters in the Marvel film that lead up to Infinity War and Endgame, a casual viewer will not care the same way a fan will. Yet that shouldn't detract from how skillfully the writers and directors manage to balance so many elements and fuse so many genres to deliver a unique piece of pop-entertainment that is full of humor, spectacle, and drama.The Avengers is not a particularly profound franchise. It doesn't attempt to be allegorical like The Lord of The Rings, it isn't as mind-expanding as The Matrix, it isn't as mystical as the original Star Wars, nor does it make any social commentary like The Dark Knight, but it has plenty of great archetypal characters who embody different aspects and struggles with heroism. Each character plays so well off the other and the cast has so much chemistry.No other franchise understands its characters better than Marvel, and no writers have a better grasp of heroic conflict and camaraderie than Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely. Comparing their work in Endgame to other franchises like the DCU's Justice League or the current Star Wars is night and day.That isn't to say Endgame is perfect. A Masterpiece doesn't have to be perfect, and most aren't. Certain elements of the plot feel rushed and loopholes are glossed over. Not all the jokes land, but most are pretty funny. Captain Marvel is way too powerful which constantly makes her a Deus Ex Machina. There are any combination of nitpicky observations I could make about parts that don't exactly make sense, but those are minor.Admittedly, I do have a bit of Marvel fatigue after this. It almost feels like Endgame was so epic that I don't ever need to see another super hero movie again. Sure, I'll probably see the new Spider-Man, and even though I really like the films and the character, it's reaching a point of over-saturation."
kwesipaa-80807,"Nov 5, 2019",10/10,Avengers endgame is one of a kind well done Marvel studios
ClearAllSpam,"Apr 28, 2019",6/10,"Honestly: at the 2 hour mark i was checking my watch to try and figure out how much more I had to put up with before it made sense.
The storyline was sporadic, and bounced around so much that it just got confusing and boring.
I have no intent, nor interest, to watch it again"

ivanmessimilos,"Nov 14, 2021",9/10,"It's definitely not as strong an impression as it was on first viewing, which makes perfect sense, but I still think the film was extremely successful on multiple levels. One of the better things is that the three-hour film is not boring at any point, it seemed to me to last ""only"" two hours, which is not easy to achieve. I also look at this film as the finale or the last episode of a series you've been watching for years, which on the one hand is actually true. So much has happened before this film, so many characters and events. This film is just the crown of it all, one big rounded whole. It is obvious that the Russo brothers had a plan because it is obvious that they paid attention to details and some smaller moments that real fans will easily recognize. Of course I have some objections that are related to certain characters and some scenes, but given the type of film and how much the film offers, I can just get over it and forget about it. I think this Marvel project is unrepeatable and it's something we should appreciate no matter what you think of movies like this."
gabbymelissa,"Nov 3, 2019",10/10,Great movie i almost cried and great ending to the series of movies
rockman182,"Apr 26, 2019",10/10,"The Marvel Cinematic Universe comes to a point where a film feels like an actual event. We have been waiting in anticipation for a year to see the final showdown that started in Infinity War. Actually, scratch that. The entire Infinity Saga started way back with Iron Man. 22 films, countless number of heroes coming together in the culminating battle against Thanos. So much anticipation, ticketing app crashes, and going through so much to try to see this on opening night. Now here we are. Does Avengers: Endgame live up to its high expectations? Absolutely. I felt like it was unique and carries the most emotional weight off anything in this universe but it absolutely serves its fans who have been loyal for years and years.The film takes place three weeks after the end of Infinity War. Half of the worlds population have been wiped out by Thanos and now the remaining Avengers (who just so happen to consist summarily of the original Avengers) must find a way to not only defeat Thanos, but also avenge the fallen and find a way to counteract the actions that occurred at the end of Infinity War. As expected the film stars a gigantic cast of Hollywood's best and watch out for the cameos from heroes who have appeared previously in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.I really would like to talk about this film in a spoiler review but as with every review on my site, there will be no spoilers. I will say that this film has a unique take almost immediately. The humor and banter is still there as it always is and the character arcs are as fantastic as ever at its near completion. The film carries the most emotional weight as anything this universe has seen. The film has so much fan service. I think if you go early on and with a packed crowd of fans you will see just how much this means to the audience who have stayed loyal to this saga.There were laughs, there were cheers, there were gasps, and yes there were tears. The film feels like it should be the very last that the MCU has to offer but of course we know there are Spider-Man and Black Panther sequels coming. The final battle brings just about everything you could hope for. If you're a fan of the series I think you will enjoy this film as it makes a case of being the best Avengers film. It goes hand in hand with Infinity War, of course both films were shot together.Members of the original Avengers put on performances that do their characters the utmost justice after being on this journey for a decade. The film builds up quite slowly but once the plot takes form and the battle lines are drawn it delivers in the way the Russo brothers know how to. Th action is there, and all of what makes the Marvel Universe such a sweeping phenomenon is always there. Some characters could get more screen time, sure. You have to remember that there are so many characters that the film has to juggle and it does that admirably as it is.The film will be a box office hit for sure and will be well reviewed in regards to the Universe as I can already see. I will be seeing this again tomorrow morning and have the same excitement going into a second viewing as I did my first. I found this to be a very special entry and feel like it ties up so much in such a perfect fashion. If you are a fan of superhero fans you need to see this as soon as possible and should do..Whatever it takes.9/10"

marta-20240,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Definitely not as good as its predecessor but one to be conjured with nevertheless.
The movie starts a bit slower than all MCU movies before it and it takes its precious time to get the action going, but once it does, its all forgiven and forgotten.
Although predictable, because let's face it, where could they go after Infinity Wars? It delivers on all fronts!
There were tears and laughter throughout the 3 hr long feature. The tears yanked out of you by Ant Man, Stark, Cap and Hawkeye and the laughter mainly by Thor who surprised everybody with his transformation, but also by Hulk/Banner who found a peaceful way to co-exist.
There were cameos sprinkled throughout the whole length of the movie, some very emotional, like Agent Carter, who actually didn't have to say a single word to get the tears flowing.
They tied up all the loose ends, revisited some great scenes from past beloved movies and, thankfully, did not give all the glory to insipid Captain Marvel, who despite being the most powerful of all the Avengers, delivers quite a forgettable performance.
There are some key characters who will definitely not be coming back, but there is still plenty left for future plots. Although it will feel a lot less exciting with some of the most beloved characters absent from now on.All considered, a very good movie to end it all, one that you may want to watch it again to take it all in as I will be doing. Well done to all involved and a great big thank you for such a ride that spanned for over 10 years."

comicnerd-22808,"Jan 9, 2020",10/10,"Avengers: Endgame is quite possibly the most hyped up movie of all time. The excitement surrounding this films release is a dream come true for Marvel Studios and Disney. With that being said, I have looked forward to this film since it was called Infinity War Part 2 back in 2015 or so. I really enjoyed my time watching this and it marked the end of an era. I finally realized a couple years ago how much the MCU means to me and how much these characters mean to me that I gladly would accept anything this movie did.The CGI was good, but the green screen showed a little bit (meaning the backgrounds looked fake sometimes), the performances from Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans were great because they treated this movie seriously, the cameos in here felt welcomed and the amount of locations in this movie really make it feel like the Avengers are desperate to go anywhere and do anything to save their fallen friends. With all this being said this is a very well made movie worth your time and money."
atikainu,"Aug 30, 2024",9/10,"The sheer scale of Endgame is both its greatest strength and its most significant weakness. On one hand, the film is an epic, three-hour-long spectacle that offers a rollercoaster of emotions-grief, hope, nostalgia, and triumph. The final battle scene, where all the heroes unite against Thanos, is a jaw-dropping, cheer-inducing moment that's destined to be iconic. The visual effects are top-notch, and the action sequences are choreographed with meticulous precision.On the other hand, the movie's scale can make it feel bloated and unwieldy. With so many characters and storylines to juggle, not all of them get the attention they deserve. Some heroes, like Captain Marvel, are underutilized, while others, like Thor, receive arcs that are divisive among fans. Thor's transformation into a depressed, beer-guzzling shadow of his former self is played for laughs but also feels like a disservice to his character development in previous films.The time-travel plot is another area where Endgame falters. While it allows for some fantastic callbacks to earlier films and provides a clever way to undo the events of Infinity War, it also introduces a host of logical inconsistencies. The film's explanation of time travel is murky at best, and the rules seem to change whenever it's convenient for the plot. This lack of clarity can be frustrating, especially for viewers who prefer a more coherent narrative structure."
aka-12377,"Dec 2, 2019",10/10,They are unhappy. Instead of movies bringing joy in their lives they just want their life problems spill over to others. Don't fall for it. This is a good movie.
randomStuff101,"Aug 22, 2019",6/10,"Unfortunately clumsy. I enjoyed all previous Avengers, and a few scenes in this are very cool and funny, but this one lowers the bar overall. For me the story petered out instead of maintained momentum from previous movies. The dialogue struggles to be interesting, boring sequences at time.Clumsy Avengers fit awkwardly together for group photo, like bad high school reunion. That said, I enjoy Avengers like everyone else for years, just not this one so much.The super-power woman, Capt Marvel, her powers are overdone. Too simplistic, too much power. No reason for her to lose any fight.Was a big collective of all heroes even necessary? Sort of not really.Some scenes linger way too long, drawing out already thin content. And where was Dr Strange? He hardly had anything to say, and very brief appearance, yet he was in possession of crucial aspect of story."

BarnsleyMick,"May 27, 2025",10/10,"Avengers: Endgame isn't just a film-it's a cinematic event, a cultural phenomenon, and arguably the most ambitious and emotionally satisfying superhero movie ever made. Over a decade in the making, it serves as the ultimate payoff for years of interconnected storytelling, rewarding both longtime fans and casual viewers with a breathtaking blend of heart, humor, action, and nostalgia. It's more than a sequel-it's a celebration, a farewell, and a victory lap all in one.What truly sets Endgame apart is its emotional depth. While the Marvel Cinematic Universe has always had a strong sense of character, here it reaches new heights. The film gives each of its heroes time to breathe, reflect, and grow. The stakes aren't just global-they're deeply personal. You feel the weight of everything that's come before, the burden of loss, the ache of failure, and the spark of hope that still lingers beneath the surface.The pacing is masterful. Despite its three-hour runtime, there is not a moment wasted. The narrative unfolds with precision, shifting effortlessly between intimate character moments and large-scale action set pieces. The story is bold and unpredictable, taking risks that most blockbusters wouldn't dare to try. Yet it never loses sight of its heart-and that heart beats strong in every scene.Visually, Endgame is stunning. From its sweeping cosmic landscapes to its gritty, grounded battles, the film is a visual feast. The CGI is flawless, and the cinematography enhances every moment with grandeur and gravitas. The action sequences are choreographed to perfection-intense, thrilling, and emotionally charged. But it's not just about explosions and spectacle. The film's quieter moments are just as impactful, with dialogue and expressions that hit harder than any punch.The cast delivers some of their finest performances to date. Every actor brings their A-game, fully embracing the weight of their character arcs. The chemistry between the ensemble is undeniable, and watching them interact, clash, and unite is a joy. The film is packed with callbacks, inside jokes, and Easter eggs, yet it never feels overstuffed or self-indulgent. Instead, it feels like a reward for those who've taken the journey since the very beginning.The score by Alan Silvestri is another standout, soaring in the epic moments and softening during the emotional ones. Music has always been a key component of Marvel's identity, and here it elevates the film to another level. The themes are unforgettable, enhancing both tension and triumph with every note.What makes Avengers: Endgame so special isn't just its scale, its characters, or its stunning visuals-it's its soul. This is a film made with love and respect for its universe and its fans. It ties up threads that have spanned more than 20 films and offers closure in ways that are powerful, heartfelt, and unforgettable. It's rare to see a franchise end on such a high note, but Endgame manages it with grace, grandeur, and an overwhelming sense of purpose.There's something truly magical about seeing all the pieces come together-every character, every storyline, every emotional beat building toward a conclusion that feels both massive and intimate. It's a film about legacy, about sacrifice, about rising when everything seems lost. It's about finding strength in unity, and courage in the face of impossible odds.Avengers: Endgame isn't just the best Marvel film-it's one of the best blockbusters ever made. It sets a new standard for superhero storytelling and redefines what a shared universe can achieve. It's a love letter to its audience, a heartfelt goodbye to beloved heroes, and a thunderous, emotional, jaw-dropping finale that will be talked about for years to come.Whether you're a die-hard fan or someone just discovering the magic of Marvel, Endgame will move you. It will excite you. And most importantly, it will stay with you long after the credits roll. A true masterpiece-and one that reminds us all why we fell in love with these heroes in the first place."

The character arch of some were strangely distorted. overall a great movie. loved the ending. Tony Stark, Captain America, thor, Hulk, Black widow and Hawkeye will always remain in our hearts."
kevinpro-63904,"Jul 9, 2019",6/10,"I am not a Marvel fans so I hadn't seen many marvel movies so far . I think a good movie
especially such magnitude like avenger 4 should let most people can understand content even I didn't see other marvel movies before. As a non marvel fans moviegoer , avenger 4 is not a good movie for the audiences like me . So that why I think this movie has wild room to improve because I still think audiences like me are not the minority"
andresfelipecortesg,"Nov 4, 2019",10/10,"Avengers Endgame is the culmination of 11 years of movies, in this vast universe of comics, as a fan since the first iron man movie, which hooked, I thought that the Winter Soldier was the best Marvel movie, but Infinity War and Endgame made me To think twice, this movie is something truly epic, I had not seen something like this since the Lord of the Rings: the return of the king, and even that has plot holes, and that he makes the same mistakes as his predecessor Infinity war brothers Russo did an incredible job together with the whole cast, it's one of those movies to watch before he dies, this movie does put an ""End"" on this Infinity Saga."
Ehrion,"Aug 29, 2019",6/10,"Hurts to be a fan and say something like this. Avengers: Endgame is a movie that takes too long to mesh, forcing a situation of drama that does not convince in many parts. Practically 2/3 hours of film with many unnecessary dialogues and misdirected performances. The plot holes and bad decisions of the writers is quite evident, except for those who do not expect much from a movie that should end a fantastic universe era built over eleven years. Even so, it has it's high points in 1/3 - great moments, solid acting, and so much fan service. It's a pity that's not in the same level of Avengers: Infinity War at all, but is an 'Ok movie' and don't deserves 10/10 and 1/1 rates."
saifuddinmigraso,"May 1, 2019",2/10,"Not the Avengers Stan Lee created.
Emasculates the heroes, and attempted to sell a new hero.
The character Stan Lee created is completely destroyed. Even the abilities are messed up.
This is not Avengers."

I ain't gat time to waste on this pathetic movie."
mhagain,"Oct 7, 2024",10/10,Endgame is definitely one of my favourite films out there. Love the cast there all great and it's got a really fantastic plot and follows on so well from infinity war which in my opinion was slightly better. However endgame does not mess up infinity war but in fact enhances it and makes it much better by covering up lose ends that were left in infinity war. Beautifully done with a great cast great acting lots of sacrifice and an absolutely beautiful ending that for me will be hard to match. This film is definitely practically perfect in my opinion. It may get very very slightly slow in parts but it is still a fantastic film and well worth the watch.
Rabid_dog-sr,"Oct 10, 2024",10/10,"I love films, but seeing this in the cinema surrounded by others was the single best cinematic experience I have ever had. Funny, emotional and inspiring.From the cameos, the references, the scope, and the audience reactions, the silences and the time jumps, all well crafted and edge of seet stuff.I am late to review but after watching again recently, I felt the need to remind myself by reviewing it. My only criticism is that one character didn't get the kudos or fanfare they deserved and it was noticed, hopefully the replacement of that character will make up for it.All I'll say is.... On your left!Incredible thank you 💕"
gettodamoofies,"Sep 4, 2024",9/10,"FILM: 8.5
Rewatching Avengers: Endgame, I'm struck by how well the Russo Brothers pull off the enormous task of giving each character their due. This film had a lot riding on it, and I still find it incredibly well-made, immensely enjoyable, and ultimately satisfying. The drama is especially well done here-Marvel finally nails it after a string of more digestible, lighter stories. The weight of the stakes is felt throughout, and it's a welcome change.The drama is where this film really shines for me. After several years of Marvel playing it safe with more easily digestible stories, Endgame takes a much-needed dive into heavier emotional territory. It's clear that Marvel finally got it right, delivering drama that feels earned and impactful. Downey Jr, Evans, and Renner are the standout beneficiaries of this approach, with the film both opening and closing with some of their best moments. Their performances anchor the story, making it feel grounded even amidst all the superhero spectacle.The action is, as expected, top-notch, but what surprises me is the level of violence-there's a bit more edge here than I'm used to seeing in a Marvel film. It's refreshing to see some real variation and consequence in the battles, something Marvel has tried to smooth over a bit too much in the past. Watching these characters face real stakes is immensely rewarding, and it adds a layer of intensity that makes the film all the more compelling.Comedy still has its place in Endgame, providing much-needed relief from the drama-heavy narrative. Thor and Rocket handle most of the humour, and while I enjoy their banter, I do feel that Thor's storyline pushes the comedy a bit too far. It sometimes feels like it's making light of what should be serious moments, which can be a bit jarring.After 11 years, Marvel truly delivered a fitting end to this saga. Seeing how successful it was, and how the franchise has failed to reach similar heights over the past five years, is a testament to just how well they wrapped things up.FORMAT: 4K Ultra HD Blu-rayVIDEO: 9.0

rastkomioc,"Apr 26, 2019",6/10,"For a Marvel movie it was ok, better than most. However this has no place being higher ranked than Schindler's list, Pulp Fiction, Fight Club, Forrest Gump, Every Kubrick movie ever made and many more. People should take of their Marvel fanboy hats and stop shoving these movies to the top. I'm not saying you shouldn't enjoy them, but stop inflating the reviews just based on the fact that you grew up with the characters and judge them on the movie itself."
kaintrust,"May 4, 2019",N/A,"Nowadays it is like a crime to say bad things against Marvel movies but someone has to tell the truth
This movie is extremely over-hyped. The first 2 hours there was almost no action, it was unnecessary endless dialogs, flashbacks and seconds chances.
When we thought we gonna see some action, it took 30 min only. And then back to aftermath dramas again.
I like dramas and deep stories in the movies but we already know these characters stories. why to over-extend that much?
Acting was empty and going nowhere, CGI was almost none since there was a limited action.
If it was up to me i would wait for torrents buy my gf wanted to see so much and in the end she also got disappointed."
mpnr-87736,"Apr 27, 2019",8/10,"I've been a fan of superheroes since I was little kid. When Iron Man was out, I couldn't believe it, it was so good. But, I completely fell in love with the idea of the MCU when I watched Captain America: The First Avenger.
Here we are, 10 years later, 10 years loving fictional characters, loving the actors, loving the movies, to have it ending like... well this.I think they had a great idea, a great way of saying goodbye to the most beloved characters, but I think the movie fell short. I was more emotional during the ending credits than the whole movie. I felt like I needed more, like there was many things left unsaid. Maybe I'll love it the second time I watched it? I don't know honestly, for now, I am a bit disappointed with this one."
ali_ayyaz,"Apr 27, 2019",8/10,"Couldnt help feeling that Endgame is to Infinity Wars what Dark Knight Rises was to Dark Knight.A good follow up but the bar was already set too high. Very entertaining, with a satisfying ending, but got there after quite a few plot holes and unanswered questions.It felt like the writers wrote the ending first and then tried really hard to take us to that end, regardless of what plot holes they were forced to leave in the wake.PS didn't really like what they did to Thor and Hulk. Good for laughs maybe, but the characters deserved better"
vautyodayoda,"Nov 20, 2023",9/10,"This films quality depends on how you watched it and who you are. If you watched most of the MCU up to this point like I did then this will be a revolutionary endgame that redefines all of film culture. Otherwise it seems rather bad and underwhelming. The film has a forward moving plot, great acting and some CGI actually worth looking at. This film didn't become the highest grossing movie of all time for no reason. It does have some obvious flaws tropes and plot holes but other than that acts as a brilliant finale to the infinity saga. Now don't watch the multiverse saga. It willn't ruin your opinion but they aren't good sequels either. All in all a film worth watching if you have watched the entire MCU up to that point, otherwise an okay film. And watch infinity war before you watch this, otherwise literally nothing will make sense."
EllaM44,"Sep 6, 2024",9/10,"Marvel's The Avengers is a landmark in superhero cinema, bringing together multiple characters from previous films into one action-packed, cohesive narrative. The chemistry between the ensemble cast-particularly Robert Downey Jr. As Iron Man and Chris Evans as Captain America-elevates the film, while Joss Whedon's witty script keeps it fresh. The final battle in New York is a visual spectacle, combining stunning effects with thrilling choreography. While the plot is fairly straightforward, it excels in delivering fan service and setting the foundation for future Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) films."
benji246,"Apr 30, 2019",7/10,"The first half of the movie have some slow and boring scenes, not an end game type movie, missing action and the power start, the second half and the last 40 minutes marvels best, can watch multiple times only for thanos"
JOSH_75,"Oct 23, 2024",10/10,"This movie is simply brilliant! The Ending is sad but a necessary Chancg for marvel. The New movies are mstly just trash! It is very sad to see such a great studio die. This masterpiece was a loveletter to All Fans. Its even for non-fans a must watch movie all the new multiverse trash is just marvels try to get the last cents out of the viewers pockets. Its very sad to see how disney and their greed ruined the entire franchise. So have fun enjoying this last masterpiece by marvel Studios. I personally love the Endingen, but i can unverstanden everyone, who disagrees with me!I think disney killed marvel and star wars!"
simonfineart,"Jun 23, 2019",7/10,"After all the hype, I expected to be extremely wowed. But I left feeling kind of meh. It was extremely long and dragged in several places. I felt like Infinity War was better overall. Good movie but seriously overhyped."

Let's just shut our brains off and ignore the absolutlely OVERWHELMING amount of stupidity and shallow, fake pathetics that these plots and heroes present us with.Not me!
I'll say that the Infinity War was actually good, this was far too much of a brain hurting cringefest."
maurodc,"May 17, 2019",10/10,"Hello again everyone! It's been almost a month since thousands of Marvel fans (including myself) got to see the one and only Endgame for the very first time, without having a clue of what could possibly happen. And as with most of the people who already watched it...there are no words to describe how this amazingly crafted piece of superhero movie-making just...blew me away.I will start by giving its credit to the acting work of everyone. When we appreciate that, we can see that this isn't just another sci-fi flick where no one does exactly a great effort to make a remarkable performance. No. This is a movie that presents us a group of heroes that, after long years of saving the earth from any menace, are giving the last of themselves in order to give the planet one last shot. The performances made it all seem authentic and real.Now, the story. God. The story is many things. Sometimes it's funny, as any other of the previous movies from the MCU. But also it's deep, melancholic, tragic, and most of all, undeniably exciting.10/10. Probably most of the people that will read this had already watched it. But in case you haven't, you really, REALLY ought to do so. Probably during quite a few years, there will be no other film of the genre that can possibly make you feel all of the emotions that Avengers Endgame made the audiences feel, and made me feel. Don't miss it for anythingPeace!"
alexduchien,"Apr 24, 2019",8/10,Good movie but a bit long especially during the 2nd phase (could skip 30min ez) and the end is not as epic as Infinity was last year...harcore fans will absolutly love it for sure for other it's just a good ending.
AmerAbduallh,"Apr 27, 2019",10/10,"I have never wrote a review about any movie I watch. I just feel that I have to document what just touched my heart. Growing up in the Middle East, specifically in Saudi Arabia, without cinema was hard for me. I remember I used to wait months after the movie comes out to watch it online. When I was in college, I used to travel to Bahrain to watch Marvel movies. I enjoyed watching all the movies. I have developed a strong connection with all the characters. I feel what they feel, I understand what they understand. It became a part of my life. My friends, even my close friends, used to make fun of me for watching superheroes movies. They always say that there is no story it is all CGI, what are you watching it for? They do not understand the creativity of developing characters and flashbacks, let alone understanding a complex plot with many planets and universes. I am so happy that I made it to the U.S and watched the movie in the opening day. With that said, Avengers: Endgame is one of the most epic movies I have ever seen. I laughed too loud, cried too hard, and smiled a lot. I will not write any spoilers, I am not that guy, but I wanted to share some of the feelings that I experienced in these epic three hours. The movie has everything perfect the writing, acting, and directing are all outstanding. If there is one wish that I could have in life is that watching this movie with someone I love who have the same admiration for Marvel movies. To the creators, actors and actresses, people behind the scene, and everyone participated in creating it I cannot thank you enough for what you have done. I know this is not a perfect review but I had to share it somehow."
athanasiosskoutas,"Apr 30, 2019",6/10,"I'll keep it as short as possible and spoiler free, I didn't expect this movie to be better than Infinity War but it was a disappointment, unfortunately...
The cons first:
a) This movie is almost an MCU clip show. I won't spoil the plot but to me it felt repetitive. Like eating reheated pizza.
b) Too slow. Do you remember the action sequences and the fast pace of Infinity War? Forget that. Literaly there's almost no action for the first one hour and a half!
c) Dispropotional screen time. Unlike infinity War, the majority of superheroes have too little screen time (I'm talking about fighting scenes). Again, I can't spoil anything but some heroes have two or three lines and a ten second action scene.
d) Thanos himself. Unfortunatelly Thanos wasn't as good (or should I say... bad) as he was in Infinity War, he almost feels like a heavy bag with a few lines (and I mean few).
e) Predictable plot (maybe that's only me).
f) The final big battle feels hasty and bad edited. There are too much going on on screen with a very little time for each character.
g) It has a pessimistic and dark tone.
Now the pros:
a) Solid conclusion. The movie is a solid conclusion of MCU's phase 3 (and perhaps MCU itself).
b) Good humor. That's not a surprise for a Marvel movie, there's plenty of tasteful humor and in the correct amount.
c) Good performances. Nothing to add here.
d) No political agendas. I hate it when it happens and thankfully this movie is ok (there are one or two cringeworthy scenes though, but nothing importand).
e) There are some good action scenes and the effects are awesome.
Overall, it felt rushed and it lacks the majestic feeling of Infinity War. I can remember plenty of scenes in Infinity War which gave me goosebumps, unfortunately there's none in Endgame...
Final verdict: 6/10 when I compare it to Infinity War (it's unavoidable), 7/10 as a stand-alone MCU film. In my opinion it's the third best Avengers movie (right below Infinity War and the first one). I didn't regret watching it at the theater, in fact I suggest you to do it, but I won't watch it a second time..."
shaun_gardneruk,"May 7, 2019",6/10,"Spoiler free.....
For those who have given this a 10, take that with a pinch of salt, it really isn't. There's a strong argument that suggests infinity war was an overall better film.
Endgame drags in places as it tries to cram in so much more, building up to a noteably predictable ending.
The direction some of the characters have taken this time around is polarising and didn't work for me. Some key MCU characters going forward we're also given limited screen time which, for those keen to know what the future holds.. I'm not sure anyone really knows now.Whilst the changing of the guard will be welcomed you do get a sense of, this is really the end of a great journey for marvel. Barring a series of solo follows ups and a play in the tv series space we're unlikely to see an avengers style films of this magnitude anytime soon!I've always been a fan ever since the iron man graced our screens, however for me, they have slipped up quite a few times along the way (Thor series) was poor and captain marvel was average."

pathumgunath-93252,"Nov 5, 2019",9/10,"It's not Perfect as we imagine, There is so many curious in avengers infinity war ending & that's why people came to watch this movie in theaters.. It's not the best movie in Avengers Series."
NpMoviez,"May 8, 2019",9/10,"After waiting for a year, Avengers: Endgame hit the theatres and shattered a number of box office records worldwide. But, was it really so perfectly great? No.Good : The first thing I loved about this movie was that it was the most character driven film in the MCU till date. In particular, Hawkeye and Black Widow got the most of character shine. And, it didn't have much of Captain Marvel. As someone who feels awkward when she comes on screen, it was a good thing. It did a great job of serving the fans. So many crowd pleasing moments! I was literally jumping and whistling when I was watching this film, literally. The third act is full of those moments. Those moments do come along with really good character background, a story and excitement. All of these do not make complete sense, but at least they weren't blant. And, many parts are quite nostalgic. It has tried it's best to give every character a proper arc. Performances are incredible. I didn't even hate Don Cheadle in this movie. On the whole, it was insanely entertaining and has ridiculous amount of great moments to say the least.Mixed : It's not a spoiler to say it's a time travel film. While this plot device served a lot to give us a lot of crowd pleasing moments, each of which I really loved, the whole time travel part could've been even more epic and exciting than it was. There were parts in Infinity War where it jumped from plotline to plotline. This one does the same, but it looked more choppy here. Not necessarily a bad thing, a movie of this scale would have such problems. But it was a bit more distracting than before. I admit I liked many arcs given to the characters. But, they were still a bit illogical, in particular that of Steve Rogers. Many things were entertaining as hell, but still quite paradoxical.Bad : It's a time travel movie. It generates a lot many plot holes and inconsistencies. It uses time travel as an excuse for getting certain things done. It has the most generic issues of a non sci-fi time travel movie. The timeline surely is messed up now. I don't know how the time travel in this universe works and how certain things were amended due to all of these time travelling stuffs. May be I will never know. And Thanos. He was treated more like a mustache twirling villain, rather than how he was in Infinity War. The way his character ended was the most disappointing part of the movie. It feels as if it tries to be as big as Infinity War while it clearly isn't.Conclusion : You can and must watch this film. It's a film by the Russo Brothers, you can definitely count on them for an entertaining film, but this is perhaps their weakest film in the MCU. It isn't well paced as Infinity War is, but still gives all the moments you can wish for. Infinity War is a whole lot better than this film, but is still a worth watching flick. If you stop thinking about the inconsistencies time travel creates in this film, this will be a much better experience.Rating.Score : 8.9/10Grade : A"
s_pablo,"Apr 25, 2019",9/10,"No one goes to see a comic book movie expecting to see an art house film. It happens sometimes but it is not the normal. What you expect to see is a fun movie with some philosophical concept and some emotional depth, comic books were never just about the action. So is this a great film? I don't care. Watching it I never stopped to think if there are plot holes or if the cinematography is good, I just enjoyed it. And enjoyed almost everything about it. The Russo brothers are not the new Goddard or the new Bergman (or even the new Spielberg) but they are talented and intellectual people, they had a goal and they delivered by not only doing fan service but also story service. The MCU has a great future.So, is it a great film? Comparing it with cinematic masterpieces I could give it a 6-7/10.

ocnajob,"Oct 2, 2019",6/10,"Seems that they separated every good parts and put them in Infinity Wars and leftovers into this one. Plot is ridiculous, with most of the heroes unused/underused. Are those actors even involved in making of this movie? It is more like clip show episode, made of chaotic parts from previous Avengers, where even CGI quality is different or in the worst case, they combine new things into old scenes, so difference in quality is even more obvious.Time will lower rating of this movie when hype stop. Now, this movie is first one in All time worldwide gross, so it will be more criticized (Avatar can rest now).I watched it in full cinema in first days of screening.

A perfect compliment to a two part epic. It was what I thought it was going to be, a lot of talk, a lot of planning, but amazingly it was not boring. Not for one second!
Infinity War was the moment we were all waiting for and then they tell us they are going to split it into two films. End Game could have gone south with this choice, but it did not. It's always exciting, especally if you are a comic book fan or have been watching these movies for now eleven years.
Don't want to say too much, but shine a light on Robert Downey Jr. who got to perfect his Iron Man persona to the point where Hugh Jackman can't even surpass him. Captain American is giving all us FanBoys everything we ever wanted to see and Thor...underperforms with hilarious results (and hopefully will create 2019's most popular costume for a certain type of man). Loved Mark Rufflo in this film and Thanos baby, still the baddest villain around.

eddie_baggins,"Apr 24, 2019",8/10,"DISCLAIMER- This is a spoiler FREE reviewWell, here we are.After 11 year's of top quality entertainment and planning that started all the way back with 2008's surprise smash hit Iron Man (do you feel old yet? I sure do), this part of Marvel's world domination comes to an end with what's likely to be one of, if not the biggest film's of all time, The Avengers: Endgame.It's a somewhat odd, occasionally emotional and fitting experience sitting back and concluding this part of the Marvel universe and while we know there's countless more Marvel film's coming our way, Endgame really does feel like the culmination of year's of hard work and adventures, that while not perfect, feels like a fitting tribute to what's come before and what still lays ahead.It's incredibly hard to talk about Endgame in depth without ruining the narrative the Russo brother's and their team have created but suffice to say the creative minds behind the scenes have given us another top quality piece of blockbuster filmmaking, that's likely to please diehard fans and more casual cinemagoers alike, the only problem is, when compared to it's genuinely surprising and perfectly paced predecessor, Endgame does feel slightly more formulaic and long in the tooth.It's picky for sure, but Infinity War gave us a Marvel experience that was unexpected, hilarious, emotional and epic and while Endgame has this in parts, it's not as all encompassing as last year's experience, even if by the rulebook, this was never going to be the case when tying up so many loose ends and finalising so much of what has come before it over the year's.A lot of these endings and plot tie ups will please those that have invested so much into a series that has been operating on an extremely high level for a number of year's, it's just that Marvel almost outdid themselves in Infinity War, making the more by the numbers plot threads and leaps of logic found in Endgame more highlighted than usual.The other minor nitpick with the film is Endgames much talked about epic 3 hour runtime and while the film starts with some unexpected and emotionally charged instances, there's a clear late beginning and middle section of the film that at times drags and cover's similar ground one too many times, even if by relative terms, the runtime in the Russo's film never is too detrimental to the fun to be had.This fun comes in many forms, with particular highlights being Thor's new found lifestyle, the Hulk's more prominent role and Captain Marvel's addition to the Avengers family, while the films big action scenes (that must be said aren't that abundant) are a sight to behold, with Marvel once more showing off their ability to handle spectacles as good as, if not better than, everyone else.At the end of the day, it's been an incredible period for Marvel, with arguably no outright failures and an abundance of big winners, we've been spoilt for 11 straight year's and while Endgame may not be the best of the best, it's still a mighty fine and emotionally charged finale that does the beloved cinematic universe proud.Final Say -While not as surprising or even as Infinty War, Endgame is still a top quality and fitting end to so much good work that's come before it and while it's sad to say goodbye to this particular era, it's exciting to see what lays in store for Marvel moving ahead.4 peanut butter and jelly sandwiches out of 5"

lachlanhommel-99153,"Apr 26, 2019",10/10,"After what happened in Infinity war, the only question I had was ""how can they top that?"" That question was answered, no other superhero movie will be able to beat Endgame. The movie just gets better and better and the huge finale is done spectacularly and has everything you want to see and much, much more. The set up for this was perfect, the build up to this was perfect, and the pay off was perfect. Avengers: Endgame is done flawlessly and perfectly."
peacedisturber,"Apr 30, 2019",6/10,"By no stretch of the imagination does this movie deserve a spot next to Dark Knight, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Inception, Shawshank Redemption or any where within the top 100 movies. It was alright. Not revelatory. The best thing that happened in the movie was the heroic sacrifice. That was awesome. They captured the emotion perfectly, it was sad, but appropriate. This had some feel-good moments with massive collaboration from most of the entire universe. Also, this movie could possibly have elevated to an 8 if they put Deadpool in...that would have been awesome and hilarious. It was not overly thought-provoking. It was just a little above the average popcorn Marvel movie-nothing truly profound, just fun verbal quips and too much fighting and too many missions that somehow ends alright (not amazingly though)."
jewelosco,"May 3, 2019",N/A,Expected more from the Hulk after his no show in Infinity War and then after that mess the writers turn around and make one of the mightiest hero's (Thor) a drunk. Infinity was was far better and it was the perfect set up for End game that the writers screwed up
cwt-73297,"Apr 29, 2019",10/10,"The 22-movie Infinity Saga of the MCU comes to a close in its best film yet. Avengers: Endgame is everything we wanted and more. It's hilarious, it's action-packed, and has one of the best scenes I've ever seen in a superhero film, let alone any movie. It's full of fan service and nods to the previous films. I don't really have any issues with the film, at least those that are not spoilers anyway. If I had one non-spoiler issue with the film it would be fact that the first hour is a bit slow but afterwards it picks up and never stops. Really any complaints I have with this film is shut out by everything else. My complaints are just nitpicks. It fits its three hour runtime very well and provides a highly satisfying end to the 11 year saga that began with Iron Man in 2008. The MCU has set a new direction and I can't wait to see what happens next."
srinathsriram,"Apr 25, 2019",10/10,Avengers: Endgame was mindblowing and awesome. It is the best MCU movie ever. It is even better than Avengers: Infinity War and it exceeded my wildest expectation.
tyler-catanzarite,"Jul 26, 2019",8/10,"This is getting a 10/10 mostly because how it doesnt flop on its head ending a 22 movie long plot. Is this the best marvel movie? No not even close, is this as good as infinity war? No, me 2 months ago would say it is but me now would say other wise. But simply for the experience of seeing the first iron man in theaters when I was 8 to now me as 19 and making me cry it is easily a 10/10 due to it being like no other experience. If it wasnt an ending to a 22 movie long era than mayhe my score would reflect like an 8 or a 7, but due to it being what it is I am willing to bump it up. It is still better than like 15 marvel movies, it's still up there for one of their stronger movies. It's not as good as infinity war and winter soldier is still my favorite marvel movie not counting spiderman movies.TLDR: Its simply unlike any experience in film yet, having a movie end a 22 movie long story and not flop on its face, usually movies cant finish a 3 movie long story without flopping, yet this movie managed to do it with a 22 movie long story. It isnt the best marvel movie, far from it, I would argue that infinity war is a much better movie, but I would say that this is my 2nd favorite avengers movie"
7twan,"Apr 25, 2019",10/10,"A fitting way to launch the next phase of the Marvel Universe, so satisfying and the 3 hours disappeared in a blink of an eye.
Will definitely watch again in general release."
mdyaser123,"Apr 27, 2019",10/10,"This movie is everything that fans and viewers wanted it to be. It clearly shows that the makers have put their heart and soul into the movie instead of just making money out of the popularity.It is 3 hours long but never felt like it. The sequence of emotions in the movie is sad, cheer, laugh, cry and repeat.Watch it before it gets spoiled for you!!!"
setiono82,"Apr 24, 2019",10/10,"Warning: This movie will exceed your expectation!!!Marvel has quite mastered the art of story-telling!The trailer has been teasing us with pretty much nothing and what a way to promote Endgame.In the rarity of today's world, where most trailers almost tell you everything in 3 minutes.This review is about to reveal nothing just like the trailer did other than what an epic conclusion!!Tears 7/10
Intrigue 9/10
Mystery 8.5/10
Ending 9.5/10p.s. There is no post end credit scene. Save yourself 10 minutes of time."
ndarvianp,"Apr 24, 2019",9/10,"A colossal conclusion, a proper ending for an epic saga.
It brought you to the beginning, it remind you of all the years you have invested. Then boom, here is that dessert that make you overwhelmed and craved at the same time.
It closed one door to open up another, there is still a new journey ahead of us.
Great execution by Joe and Anthony Russo!"
