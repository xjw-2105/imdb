jimfly_2003,"Jan 29, 2003",9/10,"I have watched this movie when I was a pre-teen at the cinema, and MY! It completely blew me away. It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it (too young to understand), I was deeply immersed into such rich story-telling and the fantastic alien creatures. The tensely build-up atmosphere and the space-ships, grips you so tightly it seems never to let go.This movie rocks, scares you right on to your face, very mysterious, have tons of special effects (not quite CGI though, but the mechanical aliens looks just so threatening and scary). James Cameron is such a fabulous story-teller in this Sci-Fi stellar! The movie ran at more than 2 hours but I didn't feel that at all. Actually James has cut out a lot of scenes for this theatrical release back then, but you can still get those scenes back on the DVD (extra 17 minutes footage).The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong-willed woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Queen's hatch to save Newt). I have watched other alien series (Alien legacy - All four parts), but I can say this part 2 of the series is my favourite, followed by Alien, then Alien:Resurrection, and lastly Alien3)I am quite happy to see this film stays high at one of the top Sci-Fi movies in IMDB)Till now as an adult, I still go back to watch this DVD occasionally and every time I watch it again, it brings in a completely new scare, and new thoughts, also the new meaning of what is a horror movie all about!Highly recommended if you haven't watched this yet. I give it an 8 out of 10! (Truly deserves the high IMDB rating at 8.2 to-date)"
ruth.boaz,"Feb 23, 2000",N/A,"I rate Aliens a perfect 10.  This second installment in the Alien series evolves the original movie's horror/sci-fi genre into action-adventure/sci-fi, setting a standard which has not yet been matched. I like this movie because it paints a picture of the future which is realistic enough to suck you in during the beginning of the film and then quickly introduces you to interesting characters who you become concerned with; some you love and others you hate.....but none of them bore you.  By the time the action starts it's possible to forget you're watching a movie (at least the first couple of times).  The plot is filled with tension that is occasionally broken by some of the most memorable one-liners in history (especially by Private Hudson).  The special effects are remarkable, considering the fact that they were accomplished the ""old fashioned way"" prior to digital manipulation.  I can report that I now own the Director's Cut and rate this version a 10 also.  The extra footage will be extremely interesting to fans of the 1986 release.  Either version gives you great characters, suspense, action, firepower, sarcasm, and wit.  Aliens is an outstanding show!"
carflo,"Dec 8, 2004",10/10,"I am just going to add my voice to the chorus of praise for this movie. It is as near to being perfect as any I have ever seen. I will not say that it is much better than Alien - which is just about near to being perfect also. But I do love all the characters in this movie. I have rarely seen a movie where all the characters were so well developed. Even most serious dramas seldom develops each character so completely. None of these characters are stereotypes even Paul Reiser as Burke, although the slimy company/government man villain is a prerequisite in disaster type movies. I would almost say that my favorite is Michael Beihn as Hicks, just because I like his work & consider him to be underrated. But I also like Lance Henriksen as Bishop, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Bill Paxton as Hudson, and of course, Jenette Goldstein as Vasquez. I liked all of these characters. I cared about their lives & deaths. The final scene for Gorman & Vasquez still chokes me up after seeing it many times.I am not ignoring Sigourney Weaver or Carrie Henn. Ripley is the template for the modern action heroine. In the 24 years since Alien, few have been able to measure up to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Even in Alien 3 & 4, Ripley was still powerful, despite the 3ed rate quality of the movies. As for Carrie Henn as Newt, she was the emotional heart of Aliens. Cameron's ability to develop well rounded characters does not detract from his ability to create great action scenes or to scare the audience out of a several years of growth."
BrandtSponseller,"Feb 7, 2005",10/10,"Series note: It is strongly advised that you watch this film only after seeing Alien (1979). This is a direct continuation of that story.57 years after the events of the first film, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found and awakened from hyper sleep to discover that a terraforming colony has been set up on LV-426, the planet wherein she and her fellow crew of the mining cargo spaceship Nostromo first encountered the titular aliens. When Earth-based communications loses contact with LV-426, a band of marines are sent to investigate, taking Ripley and a representative from the company that financed the colony, Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) along for the ride.For the difficult job of following up Ridley Scott's excellent Alien, director James Cameron decided to go a completely different route--to make a fast moving, slightly tongue-in-cheek, boisterous action extravaganza. Remarkably, he was able to do that while still maintaining a stylistic and literary continuity that melds Aliens seamlessly with the first film.Ripley is much more fully developed in this film, although unfortunately, some of the most significant scenes were deleted from the theatrical release (if at all possible, watch the 2-hour and 37-minute director's cut instead). Cameron fashioned Aliens into a grand arc where Ripley's actions at the end of the film have much more meaning as she's not only fighting monsters, but also fighting to retain a semblance of something she lost due to her 57-year hyper sleep. As in the first film, she is still the most intelligent, courageous and resourceful member of the crew, but she has much more colorful company.The marines accompanying Ripley back to LV-426 may be too cartoonish for some tastes (as for viewers of that opinion, most of the action and the film overall is likely to be too cartoonish), but for anyone more agreeable to that kind of caricatured exaggeration, it's a joy to watch. I'm a big fan of both Bill Paxton and Lance Henriksen, and both turn in wonderfully over-the-top performances, at their diametrically opposed ends of the emotional spectrum--Paxton as the spastic surfer/redneck and Henriksen as the intense, moody sage, with a surprising reality and an even more surprising conscience to go along with it. We also get a cigar-chomping Sergeant, a crazy, butch Private, and a complex, pensive Corporal as main characters, and a mysterious, bright young girl (played in a terrific performance by Carrie Henn). Much of the center section of the film hinges on the interrelationships of these characters, despite the action trappings going on around them.Cameron carries over the crypt/labyrinth motif of the first film, and adds a metaphorical descent into the bowels of hell in the climax. The action throughout is suspenseful. Aliens contains one of my favorite ""cat fights"" in any film. It's also worth noting the influence this film may have had on Paul Verhoeven's Starship Troopers (1997)--although admittedly, we could say that Cameron was influenced a bit by the Robert A. Heinlein book, as well. Throughout all of the varied action sequences, as well as the important early scenes of colonists on LV-426, Cameron is able to clearly convey the logistics of very complex sets, so that viewers remain on the edges of their seats.Part of what makes the monsters so effective is that we're not told too much about them. We only get glimpses into their physiology's, their behavioral patterns and their intelligence. Cameron gives us just enough to become wrapped up in the film, but not so much that we become overly familiar with the aliens, or start to question the logic behind the film. He also smartly carries over some devices from the first film that were abandoned to an extent, such as the acidic blood of the aliens, and he supplies answers to the few questions that the first film raised, such as why the blood doesn't corrode instruments and objects when a dead alien is examined.Aliens is yet another example of a sequel that is just as good as an original film in a series. Just make sure you watch both in order, and try to watch the director's cuts."
Derek237,"Aug 31, 2005",10/10,"James Cameron is an extremely talented action director because not only does he know great action, but he always backs the action up with a great story and interesting characters. Aliens is his finest achievement, as far as I'm concerned. Of course, I should specify: Aliens Special Edition is his finest achievement.In 1986 several scenes were cut to keep the movie's run-time reasonable but there was one scene that was incredibly foolish to leave out. The scene I refer to is near the beginning where Ripley learns that her daughter has died while she was away in 'hypersleep' for 57 years. ""I promised her I'd be home for her 11th birthday,"" cries Ripley. This is a very moving scene that adds a great deal the character's depth and makes more sense to why she cares for a little girl named Newt later in the film. She's seeking penance through Newt with her love and determination to keep her alive at all costs. The theatrical edition obviously doesn't elude to any of this, and even cheapens the relationship between Ripley and Newt- just a little bit. James Cameron has said that all of his movies are love stories, and Aliens is a story of parental love. He has also said that the special edition is his intended (if not definitive) version of the film. For about five years or so the Special Edition was the only version of Aliens you could get on DVD. It should have stayed that way.Aliens is a unique film experience: it's genuinely thrilling and exciting, unlike a lot of movies where people shoot the evil monsters and there's disgusting blood and rapid gunfire, and it's really meaningless. In Aliens' case, the aliens are very threatening and more than just target practice. We don't see any aliens for over an hour, but once we do, it's a huge payoff. By that time, we get to know some interesting characters: Hicks (Michael Beihn), a take-charge marine who also turns out to be sweet and sincere, Hudson (Bill Paxton), a braggart who turns out to be a coward and complains most of the time, Vasquez (Jeanette Goldstein), the iron-willed woman soldier who proves to be one of the bravest characters in the film, Bishop (Lance Henrikson), a robot that is very helpful for everyone's survival, Burke (Paul Rieser), the slimy company man who the audience loves to hate, and of course, the adorable little Newt (Carrie Henn), a girl who has survived unspeakable horror. Holding the whole film together is Ripley, played by Sigourney Weaver in her surprise-Oscar-nominated performance. I think the only reason why the audience cared for her in the first film is because she was the only person left and we wanted her to live. But for this film, James Cameron added so much to her. With all this investment in characters, we're really concerned for their well-being. We don't want those aliens to get them. Some die, and I'm always truly bummed out when it happens.Filled with amazing performances and an abundance of thrills, Aliens is one of the greatest of any genre it attempts: whether it's action, sci-fi, horror, or even drama. I personally liked it better than the first film, but it's really like comparing apples and oranges. I prefer the special edition and don't see why anyone should view the other version instead.My rating: 10/10"
Pluto-3,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"THE sci-fi movie. It's nearly perfect in every way: storyline, characters, menacing threat, suspense, action, direction, music, emotion, etc... It's always been a favorite of mine and still is. To me this is not just a film, it is an experience. The adrenaline pumps like in no other film and rarely have we had the chance to see a heroine as compelling as Sigourney Weaver. She can kick anyone's ass and still keep a heart and soul. (Why she didn't win the Oscar back in 1986 is beyond me.) When the action starts, you're in for the ride of your life. Truly a milestone in movie making. Now if they could only release it on DVD..."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Feb 4, 2020",10/10,"So often when you think of sequels you imagine cynical attempts to cash in on successful movies, efforts to bring in the coins with any old rubbish, when you think of the likes of Police Academy, Halloween and Jaws you can understand why, and then there is Aliens......Not often is a follow up as good as the original (and better in some ways,) but Aliens is, I would class it as one of the best movies of all time, a cinematic Masterpiece which seems to improve with age. It's a space horror, which is dramatic, action packed and funny at times.Aliens changed the genre, sci fi would never quite be the same again. This film will have you gripped, glued and on the edge of your seat, truly an adrenaline fuelled thrill ride, with amazing visuals, wonderful acting, and terrific music. Film makers of today watch and see how it should be done.A masterpiece. 10/10"
kustom135,"Dec 21, 2005",6/10,"James Cameron's sequel, simply put, lacks the style and depth of detail of Ridley Scott's original. It's also sadly Americanized. Wisecracking Marines with big, jutting guns, cigars, and knife games. A swarm of aliens instead of one solitary killer. Ambitious, mouthy, corporate go-getters. In other words, indulgence where Scott practised restraint ...And, of course, space travel has changed between 1979 and 1986. Oh, you're still put into hibernation but, in this episode, space is of little consequence, it seems. Yet in the first movie, everyone hated hibernation and space travel was a long, drawn-out trip! The crew in _Aliens_ flits about as if they're heading across town to kick some butt.Seems Cameron just couldn't resist putting his personal stamp on the film (and stamping out Scott's vision). He even glommed a scene from _2001_ and stuck it right at the beginning of his film.Cheap sci-fi action garbage with all the TRUE suspense taken out. _Alien_ was a higher standard than that. Cameron, you were out of your depth."
baumer,"Jun 15, 1999",10/10,"There are really good movies and then there's that select few that change your life.  For me movies like Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, JFK, Titanic and Star Wars did that.  By viewing a movie you see life in a different light.  Aliens also did that to me.  I didn't think a movie could scare me as much as Halloween did but this one certainly did that and more.  The atmosphere in this movie, and the lighting and cinematography and of course the direction are top notch, and some of the scenes are some of the scariest I've seen in my life time.  But what puts this movie over the top as one of the all time greatest films ever made is the casting.Sigourney Weaver is terrific but it is her supporting cast that shines and makes you feel like you know the crew that is heading to that desolate planet.Paul Reiser is perfect as Burke,the slimy corporate kiss ass that cares about profit before human lives.  Lance Henriksen shines as Bishop, the cyborg with a heart.  Jeanette Goldstein is the rough around the edges female marine that more than holds her own with all the testosterone floating around and Michael Biehn ( another Cameron favourite )is the perfect quiet leader that leads by example and not so much a loud demonstrative voice.  But the show stopper in this flick ( just as he always is in any movie that he is in ) is Bill Paxton.Paxton and Cameron have worked on Terminator 1, True Lies, Titanic and Aliens and Bill is one of those actors that steals scenes from every actor and was always a recognizable face even before Titanic.  Here, his Hudson character is the comic relief but he is also perhaps one of the true characters that we can all identify with.  His tough exterior is nothing more than camouflage for his frightened fragile interior.  He realizes the dire situation that they are all in and he can't hide his fear.  When he finds out that they won't be rescued for at least seventeen days, his response is "" Hey man, we're not going to survive 17 hours man!  Those things are going to come in here and they're going to get us and..... "" ( Ripley ) This little girl survived longer than that with no weapons and no military training. "" ( Hudson ) "" Why don't ya put her in charge!!! ""Paxton is a gift to any and every movie that he is in and this is his finest work.  He should have won a best supporting actor that year.  And if you haven't seen this movie, rush to see it if only for Bill Paxton.  He steals the show.  But if a tightly wound, brilliantly technical and unbelievably scary movie is your thing, then you can't go wrong here.  This is easily a ten out of ten, and one of the best ever made.  If Spielberg is the king is Hollywood, then Cameron is his heir apparent.  Oh, and one more thing, Paxton will win an Oscar one day."
LnineB,"May 25, 2018",5/10,"After a brilliant ,claustrophobic and atmospheric first film , Mr. Cameron takes the Alien franchise into the realm of what would become the fail safe formula of success for action movies . He does this a full decade or even two before it becomes the norm for every action film for decades after its 1986 release. For any other franchise this would be good. But after a Sci-Fi/Horror classic original, the second film is horribly dated and predictable. Cameron removes all the horror out of the film and replaces it with an all out assault on the viewers senses. He even changes Rippleys character from a sensitive but strong survivor female lead to an alpha female , who can do no wrong, including out boxing a natural predator while controlling a bulky and clumsy metal machine body crane. The first film appeals to all demographics while the second is an unapologetic attempt to appease the testosterone filled 20 year old audience. Everything plays second fiddle to the action including the cinematography, set design, acting and even the Alien, hince the need for multiple Aliens. It is simply TOO EPIC ,with too much action and having too much ego."
Muszka,"Jan 20, 2025",10/10,"I've seen this movie a number of times, just recently watched new newest in the series, Romulus, which was OK, it's hard to recommend, but if you like the series it's worth checking out. And then I think of this movie, and I go watch bits of it, just for nostalgia. How is it that after all these years this movie casually blows any Alien movies out of the water. Even after adjusted inflation it has a budget about 2/3s of the new one.If you can ever watch a Sci-Fi horror, this movie is the one. After almost 40 years it's still the movie to beat in this genre, and I would bet some money, that it's gonna be the movie to beat in another 40."
subarctic,"Feb 6, 2003",10/10,"ALIENS really does have it all.  Perfect direction.  Beautiful cinematography.  Intense characters.  Big guns.  Action.  Heroism. Courage.  Battles.  Friendship.  Bravery.  It is certainly the BEST sequel ever made in movie history, and one of the GREATEST MOVIES EVER MADE.At its core is Lt. Ellen Ripley (played by the badass Sigourney Weaver), a warrant officer, and tough as nails.  Her character is one of the greatest heroines of all time.  Sigourney really does pull it off.  No one else could have done it like her.  Ripley's maternal connection with the young girl Newt is amazing to watch...but the ultimate scene is her final battle with the galaxy's most deadly creature - set to a pulsing military score (James Horner delivers in a big way!).  Quite possibly my favorite fight scene of all time.There's not really much else to say - just go watch the movie on DVD, and you will not be let down.  You're in for a wild ride!!!ALIENS:  THIS TIME, IT'S WAR"
WoBiE1,"Jun 7, 1999",10/10,"Just recently, I have purchased the new Alien Legacy box set on DVD, and each one is excellent. Aliens is the second chapter in the Alien saga and is probably the most remembered by today's generation. Let's face it; it changed the way sci-fi movies were made forever,and it hasn't been for the best(I'm not saying Aliens is a bad film). Aliens set such a high standard in action sci-fi(basically the new genre the James Cameron has created) that none of the copycats can compete. Take the recent movies Soldier and Event Horizon(both directed by Paul Anderson). They both try to be Alien movies but do not succeed. My advice to Mr. Anderson is to stop trying to copy what has already been done. Enough said.As for Aliens, it is a perfect sci-fi action movie. Great casting(although ALL are stereotypes), great music(James Horner is the man), great use of technology and  a well written script are all present. Weaver's performance is outstanding; one of the best action heroes of all time just happens to be a woman. If you have a chance to watch the director' cut of Aliens, I suggest you take it(it's available in the new Alien Legacy box set or alone on DVD and VHS as well as on laserdisc). It expands on Ripley's maternal persona which makes Weaver's performance all the better.James Cameron came off making The Terminator and made Aliens. He used his expertise in the sci-fi genre and created an engrossing story that does not let up until the final reel of the film. For all the young folk out there that have not seen this film, watch it and see perfection in action movie making. A must see."
sqeaston9,"Feb 2, 2008",10/10,"What can I say that hasn't already been said? Every aspect of this movie is spot on, which I can only put down to James Cameron's obsessive attention to detail. The characters are distinct, memorable and believable. The plot builds slowly into the most tense, suspenseful roller-coaster ride I've ever experienced in the cinema. The special effects are good even by today's standards, and the sets are simply second to none. This is one of my top 10 favourite movies of all time.If you like this kind of movie and haven't seen this yet, what are you waiting for? Twenty years on and the only other Sci Fi action movie in the same league is James Cameron's Terminator 2. I can only hope he returns to this genre in the future, he is the master.Oh, and try to see the special extended edition if possible, the extra scenes make an amazing movie even better."
Leofwine_draca,"Mar 17, 2015",10/10,"What more can be said that hasn't been said before about one of the greatest movies of our time? One of Jim Cameron's top three films, this is by far the best of the ALIEN saga, an endlessly rewatchable piece of classic action cinema which can best be described as ""Vietnam in space"". The alien is back and has multiplied, so now we have the now-classic action premise of ""group of marines vs. invincible enemy"".From start to finish this is perfectly made entertainment with every frame minutely conceived to be the best. The music is eerily gripping and there are dozens of one-liners to be had from Bill Paxton, excelling in his first big role as the comic relief. The horror and gore quotient hasn't been reduced at all, this is definitely not a film for the kids. But oodles of gripping suspense and guns-blazing action violence is the main thing this sequel offers and it still remains one of the best action classics of our time. Even now, when some of the special effects are starting to look a little ropey (most remain fantastic, however, especially the Queen) and when you begin to realise there are no more than six aliens on screen at one time, this is still pulse-pounding entertainment, packed with horror, suspense, tension and plenty of thrills.The cast is efficient, an ensemble outfit that pays off nicely. Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance in her best role that she can never hope to better success-wise. Michael Biehn is the hard-but-human soldier who befriends her, Lance Henriksen has his mainstream breakthrough role as the likable android Bishop. Paul Reiser's Burke is one of the greatest portrayals of corporate evil I've seen, a fantastic show of strength, corruption, evil and cowardice from Reiser. The rest of the marines are great and, most importantly, believable and likable. The action never lets up and the extended version has to be seen to get the full story. Although it runs for two and a half hours this is a film that never runs out of steam; instead it will just age gracefully like the finest wines, sitting in its place in history as a classic of the '80s."
Harlekwin_UK,"May 8, 2023",8/10,"Ripley and Jones are rescued, but 57 years have past and humans now colonise the planet where the original Alien was found.Can the Company get a crew of Marines out to the planet in time to save them? Can they survive themselves?After being awoke from such a long hypersleep, Ripley's life is very different. The Company does not believe her story and she is striped of her profession. Even all her family have now passed away. She finds herself tortured by nightmares.When the Company loses contact with the colony, after sending some colonists to investigate Ripley's story, they have a change of heart and send the crack Marines in to rescue the colonist but need Ripley's knowledge.She eventually, reluctantly joins the trip as an advisor, as long as they kill the creatures they find.When the team find that the colony is completely overrun with the creatures, survival becomes the only concern.Strong sequel. Very different in mood, deliberately, as they move into a sort of siege story and the hide and seek of the first drifts away.As a result this is a less effective horror story but is a very effective grownup sci-fi movie.Although the Marines are all stereotypes, and they have the minimum required to cover all the options, they are well acted and the action is well paced.Sigourney Weaver's second outing as Ripley allows the character greater depth and flexes some different acting muscles too. There is a believable set of relationships and dynamics between Ripley and the other characters, especially young ""Newt"", played by Carrie Henn. Indeed, the child steals many scenes from the more established actors.Lance Heinrikson and Michael Biehn are always good to watch but Bill Paxton is superb as the 'comic relief' Hudson. Paul Reiser, very popular at the time, pulls in the slime as the Company man looking to make his fortune - at any cost.The effects are good and the sets again very believable. The final showdown again grips.Although this is a very effective sci-fi action movie it is not a traditional horror, lacking the menace of the original.Things to look out for: nightmares, inquiry, queen alien, grunts, Newt, loads of one liners, another android."
bilahn,"Apr 9, 2001",N/A,"I have been long a fan of the orignal ""Alien"", but somehow I never saw this sequel until now. If this were in fact the first or only ""alien"" movie, I would undoubtedly rate it higher than I do. It's edge of your set, exciting, and much better than most movies of this type. The special effects are great, and there are some real scary moments.But to say this is ""as good"" or ""beter"" than the original--that I cannot agree with.First of all, there is very litte original in this sequel. Indeed, it is more of a remake of the first Alien than a progression. The plot if very similar, and indeed, the ending is basically the same idea, right down to Sigourney Weaver in her underwear. So the mere fact that is not original is to be considered. What Aliens offers over Alien, is faster pacing, more and bigger aliens, and a generally higher adrenaline level. This is probably why a lot of people prefer it. And it is all very well done.But Aliens is basically a military shoot-em-up. The original, for all its comparative simplicity, is a much more subtle, deftly constructed, and very atmpospheric movie.  The spareness creates a feeling of claustrophobia and terror which is very effective and memorable.  I found Alien truly psychologically frightening, while Aliens is more of an in your face adrenaline rush.  Alien also has a more interesting cast, more human and subtle. The military posturing of the Aliens cast was pretty standard stuff. Sigourney Weaver, of course, is possibly even better than in the first movie. I also like the music in the first movie better.I find Leonard Maltin's comment on the Alien inexplicable. What he seems not to like about the first movie is there in spades in the second movie.Aliens is a darn good movie, but Alien is a sci-fi classic."
AlsExGal,"Jan 21, 2021",7/10,"When I recently revisited this film I was underwhelmed. I don't think I've sat through it a second time since it was in theaters in 1986. I remembered it as a great action film and it is still a great action film.The main problem that I had - the problem I have with most James Cameron films - was the dialogue. He writes lines for these characters like they are caricatures rather than actual people. The proceedings come off shrill where the original Alien was a masterpiece of originality - monsters with acid for blood so you can't even kill them without killing yourself and destroying your spacecraft. At least I can't complain about the lack of originality of the material, because Cameron is writing and directing a sequel here.It almost singlehandedly created the aesthetic of the ""space marine,"" which makes it really hard to not see their behavior as cliche, even if it did create the cliches. I also get that their macho posturing is supposed to contrast with
how quickly they dissolve under pressure, but that isn't really a particularly fascinating character or plot development. You know from the start that they don't have a clue what they are getting themselves into. Did they not read Ripley's report like they were instructed to do? Yet not a one says ""Yikes!"" prior
to first engagement with something that is not your typical big bad.And the cliched mother/daughter relationship just springing up between Ripley and Newt is rather grating on the nerves too. I've never watched the extended version, but apparently Ripley had a daughter in the extended cut of Aliens who grew to adulthood and died during the 57 years Ripley was ""lost in space"".
That would have had this spontaneous maternal reaction make more sense.Cameron hits all of the tent pole emotional triggers - although he does it completely without nuance - the evil corporation that is just too big, prejudices accepted in an earlier era going out of fashion, and some people deserve to be rescued while others do not???? Oh, well, it is a great thrill ride. Cameron always does that well, and does it well enough here to make the film a suspenseful rollercoaster as long as you don't think too hard."
one9eighty,"Feb 12, 2020",10/10,"57 years ago Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) was part of the Nostromo spaceship's crew that encountered a terrifying alien, as the last remaining member of the crew she has drifted through space in hyper sleep. Awake and alive nobody believes her, so she is asked upon to support a Colonial Marine outfit as they go back to Moon LV-426 - a now colonized moon where the original Alien came from. They have recently gone dark and potentially abandoned the moon, and the authorities want to know why. The Colonial Marines are outfitted with state of the art warfare machinery and an arsenal to potentially deal with any threat.This is an amazing film - on par, if not better than the first in the series. It takes concepts from the first film, and then changes the approach and dynamic of the plot - expanding the universe in which the story unfolds. Some sequels just re-hash what came before them; this takes the original and does an A-Team transformation on it, attaching guns, lasers, nitro, bells and whistles. The end result is a genre bending action horror sci-fi chase war thriller masterpiece. There are explosions, special effects, gorgeous cinematography and mise-en-scene, great plot, thrilling story, top actors delivering excellent performances, scares, frights, fights, character development - oh believe me, I could go on singing the praises of this film. When James Cameron was given the reigns to this after Ridley Scott's seminal ""Alien"" film a lot of film-goes where dubious - but given the proof of the ""Terminator"" movie, Cameron had the pedigree to be successful and boy did he deliver! Not just a tour-de-force of a visual spectacle, but also a film lecturers dream as the material further promotes lots of themes and discussions - none more than the heroine who is the vehicle for plot. If the first film made people look at Sigourney Weaver differently, this film went a long way to elevating her star power as she totally flipped action hero conventions on their head - to this day her performance is still synonymous with being a major player in the change from masculine dominated cinema. The matriarchal bond shown between Ripley and Newt is great, the character development goes some way to showing an attempt to fix the fragility of the broken bond exemplified at the start of the film when it becomes clear that Ripley's own biological daughter is resentful of the unjustified absence of a mother. Another well documented discussion this film birthed deals with the parallels to war films, and in particularly Vietnam themed war film - however rather than shoehorning academic thesis' into this review I'll just say that the film did more than just entertained, it became an icon in cinema.I seriously cannot give this film less than 10 out of 10. It scared, thrilled and entertained me as a child when I watched it (admittedly under the legal age), and it still keeps a smile on my face as I watch it as an adult."
grantss,"Oct 1, 2018",7/10,"Not as good as Alien, but well made and entertaining nonetheless. Great special effects. Is overly long though, and the acting by the secondary actors (Bill Paxton and co, essentially the Marine squad) was cheesy, wooden and overly gung-ho."

SnoopyStyle,"Oct 12, 2013",9/10,"It's 57 years after the first movie. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) has been lost in cryogenic sleep until she's discovered by a deep salvage team. She's asked to return to the planet to investigate why the colony there has lost all communication. She and a team of space marines must battle the aliens in an all out fight.James Cameron has taken this franchise from its horror origins to a great big action adventure. The change in style is seamless. The action is perfect, and it's a non-stop roller coaster ride. Ripley has transformed herself from the feminist icon into a powerful mother figure. There isn't a false note in this movie. The characters are all well drawn from the humanist robot Lance Henriksen to the comic relief Bill Paxton. They all work to create one of the most thrilling rides of all times."
MaxBorg89,"May 15, 2007",10/10,"Back in 1986, sequels had become very common (Superman, Star Wars, Indiana Jones), yet people were suspicious when they heard of a follow-up to Alien, Ridley Scott's acclaimed sci-fi horror from 1979. Most of the criticism was aimed at the fact that Scott had nothing to do with the new movie, which had been entrusted to an unknown (at the time) named James Cameron. Fortunately, Cameron had shown he knew the genre two years earlier with The Terminator, and by perfecting the skills he had developed on that film he delivered Aliens, which still stands out as one of the greatest science fiction flicks of all time.Given how the first film ended (all characters but one died), Cameron wisely decided to radically separate his movie from the original, and he does so from the very beginning by having Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) wake up from her cryogenic sleep and make a shocking discovery: although she hasn't aged at all, 57 years have passed since she left the Nostromo, meaning everyone she knew is either dead or very old (in a particularly heartbreaking scene, she talks on the phone with her grown-up daughter, who is full of resentment for her ""unjustified"" absence). In addition, no one believes her story regarding the alien since, as she's told by scientist Carter Burke (Paul Reiser), the planet where these creatures allegedly lived has been successfully colonized. Suddenly, though, all communications with LV-426 are inexplicably interrupted. Thinking there might be some truth to Ripley's tale, Burke asks her to join him and a group of soldiers on a mission to uncover the mystery. And while most of the participants are in it just for the money, our heroine realizes this is her only chance of confronting her worst nightmare and overcoming it for good.The main problem with Alien, some have said, was that, as great as it can be, the characterizations were reduced to the minimum (not that it really mattered, with Ridley Scott ensuring the film retained the right pace and suspense throughout). With Aliens, character development is the last thing fans should worry about, Cameron being fully aware of each individual's potential and exploiting it as much as he can. Ripley, who was just part of an ensemble in the original, is now allowed to carry the whole film, and boy, does she carry it: rarely has there been a more solid, compelling female role in a genre movie like this (the fact that Sigourney Weaver is the only actress, thus far, to have received an Oscar nomination for a science-fiction film is further testament to Aliens' immortality). The supporting cast is equally good, with a multitude of different characters ranging from funny (regular Cameron collaborators Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton) to weird (Lance Henriksen's android Bishop) and bringing something extra to the movie's unique atmosphere.Ah, the film's mood: that's the other aspect Cameron deserves all the credit in the world for. On a superficial level, it could be said Alien was a horror movie, while the follow-up is more action-oriented; that may be true, but one should also notice that every single spectacular battle scene actually oozes tension, never leaving the audience with a pause to breathe or relax. In fact, Cameron has succeeded where many other directors would have failed: he stayed faithful to the original's tone, but managed nonetheless to make the film undeniably his own.Relentlessly creepy, occasionally very violent and consistently compelling, Aliens is a pitch-perfect piece of adult science-fiction. Watch it on a double bill with Scott's version and you will get four hours of genre film-making at its finest."
gabrielalvesdesouza,"May 27, 2021",8/10,"Direct sequence to the events of ""Alien"", unlike its predecessor, the film bets more on action than on terror and has great success in that. Ripley shows how the representation of strong women in cinema should be, eliminating cliches and purely forced scenes, the character punches and kicks the viewer as the most Badass of all time, competing only with Sarah Connor from ""Terminator"". A film that shows how extremely brave women are."
dorotka24,"Jan 14, 2008",10/10,"Aliens is one of many movies from my adolescent years that is just as good today as it was back then. It is an adrenaline filled ride filled with creepy locations, intense action, thrills, much circumstantial humor and one-liners that will never grow old (mostly thanks to Bill Paxton). It is, unapologetically, a man's movie, filled with everything except nudity (which it did not need).All movies in the Alien series have a claustrophobic feel to them, and involve a relatively small cast of players. Aliens is no exception and really capitalizes on the fear potential of the locale. Cameron is not exactly known for injecting horror into his films, but provides enough here to satisfy.The characters are very well cast and the actors have great chemistry. I especially grooved to the fact that, even though the soldiers are supposed to be tough marines, not all of them were completely gung-ho about their adventures. In fact, a few were downright cowardly and indecisive in the face of combat - something I'm certain would happen to many in such a situation. Bill Paxton stole the show as the wisecracking space marine. With all the likable characters involved, the stakes were very high. When they start dropping, we feel the loss.Movies like this just don't come around very often. The pacing is very tight, even when the action is absent. The characters and situations are interesting enough - when the action hits, it just serves to suck us in deeper. I have nothing bad to say about Aliens. It is simply an awesome movie with a well deserved reputation for being such. See for yourself."
claszdsburrogato,"Sep 6, 2023",8/10,"There is a question among many people: Is Aliens (1986) better than Alien (1979)? I already advance that I don't think that and I don't think it comes close to being better. They are two films on completely different levels. Does that make this a bad movie? No way. Aliens is an excellent film with wonderful production design. Visually it's spectacular, and that's to be expected for a James Cameron film. His direction works very well and many scenes are striking and tense. The movie isn't bad at anything it does or tries to do, but it isn't perfect at those same things. The script is very good and the story is very well developed, but perhaps for the first one being simpler and in a more closed environment makes it better. Some characters don't work so well and you don't sympathize with them, making it just boring. Overall, it's an excellent film that looks amazing, but it's no better than its predecessor."
secondtake,"Mar 24, 2011",7/10,"Aliens (1986)I had a revealing experience these last two days. I heard ""Aliens"" without watching most of it (I was in the other room). And the script is really really bad. I mean stupid bad, with these quasi military people fighting against the monsters and saying canned military things that are taken not from real army dialog but from other movies. The events really boil down to a series of missteps, and even though this band of Marines is made of tough ""hombres"" sure enough, they can't seem to get along, or get things done, or even hold their overly heavy weapons up straight.I did watch for part of it, and I have seen the movie more than once before, and I'm a fan of the first one, ""Alien,"" from 1979 (on the heels of the ""Star Wars"" craze). I expected it to be pretty good, like the first one, which has real character development and an original kind of premise. But...well, think again.Hey, I agree with most--the set design, the sense of action, the light and camera-work, the whole larger than life experience of being in this forbidding place, this is all great. Even the over the top ""movie music"" is appropriately symphonic and big. There's no way around the fact the movie is well made, and feels convincing in these palpable terms. It looks great top to bottom, and even on contemporary terms (we are a quarter century later as I write), it is sophisticated. It has aged well. If that were all that mattered--and for some it might be!--then all is well.But for me, I was still thinking there might be some interesting, chilling plot to follow. This second installment, always confusing in its plural title ""Aliens,"" is filled with a combination of stale ideas (taken politely from the first round) and romping action adventure boy stuff. It is if more intense than the first (more fighting, more firepower), but it's far less creepy. It has more goo, and more gore, but less horror, and less fear.As with the original, the lead character is a woman, and indeed a whole bunch of the Marines are women, and so this is no simple manly movie. But it remains a macho movie, or a ""machisma"" one, and that will suit many viewers fine. But if you are remotely interested in the science fiction aspects, or even the terror of the first movie (which was truly terrifying), you might be disappointed to find you are continually battered instead. It's great battering, but if you actually listen to the dialog (when there is any--the best parts of the movie are merely sounds), you'll see what I mean.James Cameron, the director here (and not the director of the first one, which is credited to the more original Ridley Scott), does the famous Cameron thing, playing a kind of ""Star Wars"" game of making an epic suited for about a 17 year old. Not that older people (and younger) can't enjoy it, but movies have their target points, and that's it here. You can see it in the dialog and plot, of course, but also in the overall feel of things, which is a combination of early computer games (1986 is a long time ago in those terms) and swashbuckler classics. It's a vivid, fast movie.You will notice, in retrospect, some ""Avatar"" features that are interesting, beyond just Sigourney Weaver. Foremost, this is a military affair, very right wing, go-get-em stuff, but with the admirable (American) rise of the individual above the chaos of both internal logistics and the logic of the evil outer world.The monster? Monstrous. The famous designer H.H. Giger is not involved here except by carryover from the first. It's a good thing he was the originator because the basic visual and sculptural quality of the monster, the planet, the ships, and the sets, is under Giger's brilliant sway, and is a defining quality of the film. It makes no biologic or engineering sense, but so what? It looks great.In all, clearly, there are amazing things here, taken on their own level. But there are discouraging ones, too, for those who are willing to pay attention. The little blonde girl at one point says, ""Mommy...I mean Ripley, I'm scared."" And Ripley (Weaver) says, ""I know, Honey. Me, too."" That's the core of it all. Don't forget your grenade launcher."
Illia2002,"Aug 16, 2025",9/10,"Recently, I watched the sci-fi action film Aliens, a sequel to the original Alien, directed and written by Ridley Scott and released in 1986. This movie directly connects to the original film and continues most of the ideas of the first Alien. It was warmly praised by the audience and critics, earning $150 million during its theatrical run and making it one of the highest-grossing films of 1986 worldwide.The story begins with a shuttlecraft with Ellen Ripley on board. She has spent 57 years in stasis after her spaceship was destroyed and the crew was slaughtered by an alien. Once she is rescued by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, which organized the first mission to the unknown planet. They are wondering what happened to the spacecraft, Nostromo, so Ellen tells her story, but the employers doubt her claim about alien eggs on the exomoon LV-426. The company unveils a colony that was settled on the exomoon more than 20 years ago, and they have never received any messages about aliens. However, a few days later, contact with the colony is lost, so the company asks Ripley to investigate what happened there with a group of Colonial Marines. Still traumatized by her alien encounter, she agrees on the condition that they exterminate the creatures, and the mission begins.Overall, Aliens received generally positive reviews. For example, audiences gave the film an average grade of A on an A+ to F scale. Reviewers agreed that Aliens is a very successful sequel, compensating the plot's predictability with special effects, techniques, and a constant stream of scary scenes. The film even received two awards at the 1987 Academy Awards: Best Sound Effects Editing (Don Sharpe) and Best Visual Effects (Robert Skotak, Stan Winston, John Richardson, Suzanne Benson). Weaver was nominated for Best Actress for her role as Ellen Ripley.Finally, I found Alien to be a good sci-fi horror movie. Although it shares much of its storyline with its prequel, it's a gorgeous movie with thrilling visual effects. Also, the acting of the main characters is worth mentioning - as a viewer, I felt all the danger of fighting the aliens with them. I would recommend it to all fans of the Alien universe."
snoozejonc,"Jul 30, 2025",10/10,"Aliens has a great premise that follows the original movie perfectly.Everything that builds to the first major confrontation mixes great tension, entertainment and in some moments (traumatised child) is quite disturbing.When the action kicks off it showcases some of the most pulsating action scenes in film history. It is a relatively short but intense sequence that gives a taste of what the characters and audience are in for.The initial action subsides into a mid section that slows down the pace with strong character moments, a chilling horror suspense sequence (on par with the original movie), and sets up the final action scenes perfectly.As we see the remaining characters fight for survival, Aliens delivers one great action sequence after another that all flow perfectly into each other.It features a towering lead performance from Sigourny Weaver, who gives the perfect balance of strength, sympathy, heroism and vulnerability. She embodies protective maternal instincts, PTSD and courage under fire.She is supported perfectly by Carrie Henn, Lance Henrikson, Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, Paul Reiser, Janette Goldstein, Al Matthews, and William Hope.Visually and technically it is brilliant. One early transition from a character's face to planet Earth is amazing. It is difficult to single out highlights as everything is so good, but the creature designs, practical effects and the visual storytelling are some of the greatest of all time. Stan Winston's xenomorph's remain nightmare fuel nearly 40 years later."
acereaper-86733,"Jan 31, 2022",9/10,If the special edition was released as the theatrical release this would be a 10 out of 10 film but the cuts to the theatrical version I just knocked one point off.Absolutely worth watching still.
Xstal,"Dec 29, 2023",9/10,"Aliens (1986)...Allegorically and quite unintentionally a tale of a virus, ignorantly released its only aim is to destroy us, the wheels set in motion, a search begins for a new potion, but perpetuation has begun, and there's absolutely nowhere you can run - from the evolutionary transformations, variations and mutations, the prequels, sequels and un-equals yet to come.Just like all great frighteners, there are links to the real world horror of what the world of science mixed with mother nature might have in store for us in the not too distant future, or indeed may well be incubating in a laboratory nearby already.Aliens (1986)."
jack-now,"Dec 30, 2004",6/10,"Sequels are often hated with a passion. All sorts of action packed movies usually find a sequel - Batman had his, as did Superman. So did the 1979 classic science fiction thriller Alien, directed by Ridley Scott.Aliens, a catchy name for a sequel, was directed by James Cameron, who two years earlier directed the hit action science fiction movie Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger. Cameron, an action director, obviously had a lot to say in the production. So why didn't I like it as much as the first one?Number one has to be the cast. The cast in the first was a small one, maybe ten actors at tops, but they were all awesome. Weaver was much different, although I have no complaints about his work in the sequel. The cast in the second one I found really irritating, although many have loved Bill Paxton ever since, I found him annoying. As for Michael Biehn and Lance Henriksen, I have no complaints, they did a marvelous job. But the woman who played Vasquez, and the whole character of her's was just bad.Number two would have to be the way it's directed. It's no longer a science fiction movie, it's no longer a thriller or even a horror movie, it's an action movie, with lots of explosions and weapons and fire and all that. I was disappointed with the whole plot outline, the whole movie has just been constructed around battle scenes that many people appreciate. But not I.As a sequel that's been praised through the roof by so many, I have to say that the prequel once again triumphs. Scott's direction is much more beautiful, the cinematography is better, the score is better and the movie is scarier and more scientific as a whole than this one. I gave this one a six, I think I gave the first one a ten. But just to end this review, I highly recommend this to the people that like to find out what happens after the first one and to those who like action movies with some spooky scenes."
FilmIsDead-61480,"Jan 6, 2023",5/10,"Every time I watch this I can't escape the feeling that it reduces the brilliant, atmospheric original to an average action movie.What I find annoying about ""Aliens"" is the forced characterizations of the cliche space marines. Each one of them is an archetype whereas the crew members of the original movie were so realistic and memorable, I can recall each of their names and I feel like I know their individual personalities. I can only recall one of the marine's names, which would be Michael Biehn's character -- who was totally wasted -- and could have been played by anyone.Most annoying of all is the movie's overt attempt to portray its female characters as badass and capable. The most obnoxious example is the butch hispanic one who looks and acts ridiculous. Most embarrassing of all is the red-headed guy who serves as her hype man, literally giving her a high-five when she makes cocky remarks so the viewer knows they're supposed to like her and be impressed. When she is introduced, her ginger hype man literally says ""you're just too bad"". You know writing is weak when a movie has to tell you its characters are cool. In the original, we were sold on Ripley as she proved her competence in survival whereas here it feels like pandering.From my perspective, it seems that ""Aliens"" has been overhyped by the action movie fan. If that is your genre of choice, I can appreciate why you enjoy it, but I draw the line when I start hearing claims that this is superior or even equal to the original. I suspect that many of those who make such claims are the types who did not have the patience or appreciation for the slow burn of the original. It's kind of ridiculous to think that a movie like ""Alien"" needed an upgrade to begin with. Maybe in some people's minds, the thought of multiplying the number of xenomorphs elevates the material, but in my opinion all this does is diminish the scariness, which cheapens the whole subject.James Cameron essentially rebooted ""Alien"" with more xenomorphs and armed characters to allow for more action (that falls flat.) He swapped the Nostromo for the colonist base which pales in comparison. I found the colonist base to be uninteresting as a setting, unlike the Nostromo which felt claustrophobic, moody and more visually interesting with its memorable technologal aesthetic. ""Aliens"" is visually boring in comparison. The special effects are mostly good but somehow aged worse than the original's. The movie mostly consists of these characters lumbering down corridors wearing unconvincing costumes and spouting one-liners.Narratively, there really is not much to say. The planet from the first movie has been colonized but the downed alien spacecraft was never found even though it was established in the original that Weyland-Yutani knew about it. One family stumbles upon it and shortly thereafter the whole base goes dark. A team of marines is sent in and Ripley joins them as an advisor under the pretense the xenomorph will be exterminated, which she stupidly believes despite finding out for herself in the first movie there was a secret agenda to recover one. The ho-hum story is the same conventional narrative about shady coporations we have seen countless times that only serves to set up action set pieces.I feel that sequels to ""Alien"" suffer from the same problem as all the sequels to ""Jurassic Park"" because they don't really continue a thread or answer questions, they're just episodic excuses to place this character into a new creature-feature. My rating is not an attempt to bring the average down to be contrarian -- as a fan of ""Alien"" I just never got much out of watching this.I'd like to think that if Ridley Scott had a burning desire to do a sequel, he would have the story in a setting distinct from the first, such as Earth because there is great interest in what that looks like. (An ""Alien"" movie in a ""Blade Runner"" type setting would have been amazing.) ""Alien 3"" had the respectable ambition to return to just one xenomorph but the result was a dull and uninspired remake of the first movie that was much worse than this. The ""get in, get out"" story of ""Aliens"" brings ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" to mind so I don't get all the love for this movie. It is a technical achievement but far from a masterpiece in any other regard. People use that term too loosely. I'll take ""Prometheus"" over this or any of the other sequels any day."
Dannov747,"Jul 29, 2017",9/10,"This is, in my opinion, the best action movie of all time, and one of the greatest sci-fi and horror movies ever. Almost as soon as Ripley and her crew land on the Alien planet, the action, and the intensity of the violence, hardly ever drops. And this isn't just mindless action, the film expertly builds each character enough to make them more than just alien fodder. The action itself is of high quality, and the periods of quiet in between the action sequences expertly drum up the suspense. Easily the most intense movie I've ever seen."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 11, 2011",10/10,"Alien is a sci-fi classic, so when I saw Aliens I was expecting great things. Which is exactly what I got. Aliens I have often seen and heard being described as one of the best sequels ever made, and I have to heartily concur. Aliens is every bit as good as Alien, and just a brilliant film. The production design once again is immaculate with the spectacle surpassing Alien(to me), while the script is credible, the story interesting and well-constructed and James Cameron's direction brilliant. As with Alien, there are also some very genuine shocks and scares, and if there was something I marginally preferred here it was the suspense which was particularly nail-biting. The acting once again is top notch, all the supporting cast do great work but Sigourney Weaver is simply terrific and it helps that Ellen Ripley is expanded upon here. Overall, just like Alien, a sci-fi classic. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
ozorjustin,"Feb 4, 2023",10/10,"Considering this was already doing magnificently on imdb ratings, I didn't need to add mine but it left such a mark in my head and heart that at a point, I seriously doubted this was made in the 1980s. It's perfect in everything it did and tried to do. I can't just place my finger on a single fault and that's something I'm always guilty of. Some could say this is a classic but I think this is more than that. Something made in such a manner that it lives with you long after the credits roll, it deserves its own shelf in the hall of fame of movies. If you read up to this point and you are yet to decide on whether to watch or not, I have no words for you pal."
LordBlacklist,"Feb 8, 2006",10/10,"Review 2 of 4As the middle part of the Alien trilogy this film accomplishes exactly what any good second chapter must do, it builds on the world established in the first film and takes the story in new and interesting places. The emotional canvas of this story is broader than the original Alien, and the film as a whole is less subtle. I really like the theme's of family and the parallel character arcs of Ripley and Newt. They are both characters who have lost everything they ever cared about and through finding each other they attempt to fill the holes in their hearts that their respective losses have left behind. Cameron takes great time in setting up his characters from the start, something that was lacking in the original. The beginning of the film may be a little slow but like Cameron's next film, The Abyss, the payoff in the end would not be nearly as satisfying without all this time to get to know the characters and become emotionally invested. The setup is massively important to the rest of the film. Aside from the abundance of action this film benefits greatly from a larger emphasis on character. Hudson, Hicks, Vasquez, Burke, and Bishop are all very memorable characters, perhaps more memorable than those in the original film. It is the relationships between these characters that make it more than just an action film. Cameron has such a way with dialog and Aliens is a prime example. I have built entire friendships on mutual love of this movie. So many lines are so easily quotable. From a technical level this film is flawless, and like the original it has not aged much at all since its release twenty years ago.If in the first film Ripley was discovering her inner strength, Aliens is where she learns to master her fear. In this film we also learn the depths of her humanity that was scarcely present in the original film (the scene where she goes back to save her cat comes to mind.) Ripley is a character that continues to change and grow, and this film does a fine job of fleshing out her interesting (in under developed) character from the first film. Aliens is definitely a film to watch more than a few times, but for different reasons than the first. The mystery and ambiance of the original film makes it fascinating to watch multiple times, but Aliens is more like spending time with old friends, you want to spend two and a half hours with these characters. Aliens is quite possibly the perfect sequel because it gives you everything you got in the first film and much, much more."
eagandersongil,"May 17, 2017",7/10,"After 7 years, ""Alien"" is back, this time brought by another great director, James Cameron, shifting the focus of the movie a little, bringing it from terror to action, but still without losing its origin completely. With an apathetic script, where we have a situation to bring the legendary lieutenant Ripley back to action, even though not being extremely creative, the script never gives in to ridicule, on the contrary, it takes itself seriously and we take it too seriously. 57 years after the events of ""Alien"", Ripley returns to the planet LV- 426 to help families who explore the place, this time accompanied by a troop of soldiers, the ""Aliens"" end up being underestimated ... With less terror and more Action, the script still pleases. Technically the film is exquisite, having the face of the 80's, but better done, packed with visual effects that appeal to this day, James Cameron does well. Lastly, ""Aliens"" is a good continuation and a natural evolution of Plot, characters and context, but will never have the charm and impact of its predecessor."
Paul Kydd,"Feb 17, 2001",8/10,"Seven years after barely surviving events on board the Nostromo in Ridley Scott's classic sci-fi horror ALIEN, Sigourney Weaver reprised her role as Warrant Officer Ripley for one of the most compelling and critically-acclaimed sequels of all time.  Canadian director James Cameron had already struck gold with the Arnold Schwarzenegger starring vehicle THE TERMINATOR (1984), after his somewhat inauspicious feature film directorial debut with the long-forgotten, Dutch-backed PIRANHA II: THE SPAWNING 3 years earlier.  ALIENS would further cement Cameron's growing reputation as a first-rate director of high-tech, fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping action thrillers, from which there would normally be no let-up once they got going.When Ripley is rescued from drifting aimlessly through deep space, she is horrified to learn that not only has she been asleep for 57 years, but the planet on which she had encountered the original alien all that time ago has since been colonized.  At first no-one will heed her warnings or completely believe the story she gives at an official enquiry as to what happened to her and her fellow Nostromo crew members.  But then contact is lost with LV-426, and despite initially throwing Ripley ""to the wolves"" (as she herself puts in), The Company, through representative Carter J. Burke (Paul Reiser), suddenly finds itself in a position of having to ask Ripley for help, finally persuading her to return to the planet that still consumes her every nightmare, as an advisor to a motley group of very tough colonial marines expecting this to be just another run-of-the-mill ""bug-hunt"".  But how wrong that assumption turns out to be!I would argue that ALIENS far surpasses its celebrated predecessor in almost every aspect.  Obviously the sheer spectacle of what is basically a Vietnam war movie in space is particularly awe-inspiring - the impressive sets, the many excitingly-staged combat sequences, the aliens themselves (interestingly enough, although through fast cutting and appropriate camera placement it seems as though there are hundreds of aliens being blasted to kingdom come - or else picking off the gung-ho marines one by one - in reality no more than 6 aliens are ever seen in any one shot).  But the human drama element of this sequel is also greatly heightened, primarily by the introduction of ""Newt"" (wonderful little Carrie Henn, in her only film role), who turns out to be the sole survivor of recent events on LV-426, becoming a kind-of surrogate daughter to Ripley, which leads to several touching moments and gives the story a surprisingly effective emotional core in the midst of all the otherwise pre-eminent carnage.Amongst the talented supporting players are Cameron regulars Michael Biehn (THE TERMINATOR, THE ABYSS) and Bill Paxton (bit part in THE TERMINATOR, TRUE LIES, TITANIC), and Cameron's punchy dialogue includes such suitably macho wisecracks as - Hudson (Paxton): ""Hey Vasquez, have you ever been mistaken for a man?""  Vasquez (a pumped-up Jenette Goldstein): ""No, have you?""  Nominated for 7 Oscars, including Weaver as Best Actress (again this confirms the general class on display, as it is fairly rare for the Academy to recognize the acting qualities inherent in this type of predominantly action-driven movie), the film went on to win for Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects Editing.  Further, almost inevitable sequels followed in 1992 and 1997, but I prefer to think of the terrifying perils of Ellen Ripley as ending on this high note."
alexkzapf,"Aug 18, 2024",4/10,I recently watched all the alien movies. This is by far the worst one. It has no terror or suspense. It is an action flick. And. Not a good one. It is just one shootout after another with no emotion. You're not invested in the characters. Except Ripley. It just is not that good. It is boring at times. The best sequence is the beginning as someone else mention here. By contrast. Romulus takes us back to the old horror feel that made the first one such an amazing experience. This movie is more along the lines of AVP. It's okay. Not good. The writing is horrible. The dialogue forgettable. There is just not an alien movie feel to it.

Good blend of practical and CG! Great directing and cinematogrophy! Lots of atmosphere!If you ask anyone what their favorite is, there is a good chance its either this one og the first! This, along with Terminator 2 and Die Hard... remains a stable in action movie history!"
Toph-22,"May 2, 2021",8/10,"For me, 'Aliens' doesn't come close to its grandiose predecessor. In short, the reason for this is the lack of atmosphere. The first part shone through the certainty of the unknown. Sure, you didn't know what you were dealing with, but the whole way the eerie creature from a foreign world was staged and introduced to the viewer was brilliant.The sequel, of course, has the problem of some knowledge about the alien, which in turn means that the story has to be approached ""differently"".The first point that bothers me are the soldiers brought into the game. They are bursting with testosterone and try to outdo each other with churlish, clumsy and cliché-laden oneliner. There I was actually disappointed, because I had hoped the gloomy mood from the first part is continued. But then I knew the movie would probably be a completely different one.In the second section, 'Aliens' drifts into an action movie and consists to a large extent only of shooting interludes, in which an even bigger gun is unpacked. The entire location would actually provide an ideal basis for a thriller peppered with horror elements. But the setting can't work reasonably and can't spread in the viewer's mind.Towards the end, the movie really picks up speed and this section is also really good. This is mainly because the movie returns to the basic elements of its predecessor and focuses more on suspense and atmosphere. In addition, this is also because Ripley comes back more into the center. Ripley was a highlight in the first part and is again in the second.Overall, you have to say, sequels always have a hard time, 'Aliens' has tried to go new ways, has done that basically well, unfortunately it does not come to the genius of the first part. And without the fabulous last third, 'Aliens' would have been just a normal action movie for me."
l_cobern1989,"Feb 24, 2008",10/10,"When I first watched Alien i was really impressed and had to get Aliens. I wasn't sure if this could be as good because most sequels hardly ever surpass the first. But I thought this was a lot better. Don't get me wrong the first was brilliant but this was amazing. Everything was right. They had a brilliant cast, brilliant story, brilliant effects and brilliant acting.The thing i was most impressed about was the design of it all. It looked amazing. They Made things look realistic and the aliens looked really good as well. The aliens home was put together brilliantly. For a 1986 film they made the effects look really good and the set. The king alien looked very good and the set of it's home was very good as well. Yet again Sigourney Weaver puts on a brilliant performance as like she did in the first one and Jennette Goldstien as Pvt Vaquez gave a great performance and is one of the best movie heroes ever.With the first film it had a lot of parts that made you jump and had you on the edge of your seat. It was exactly the same with this one. There were lots of parts that made you jump and nearly the whole film had you on the edge of your seat wanting to know what was going to happened next and they had a lot more gore in this than the first which was good to see because i thought in the first it would be fairly gory but it weren't that much.If you thought the first was good you must watch this. You will be blown away by the effects and design and the great action sequences they have with the aliens. It is one of the best films made and it will keep you entertained from start to finish."
schuelererik,"Oct 15, 2020",6/10,Not a bad movie but the abundance of aliens and how easy to kill they seem in this film takes away a lot of the tension that the first movie so brilliantly built up. This is more of an action thriller than a horror movie and is less fun and thrilling to watch for me personally.
gtb-4,"Mar 13, 2001",6/10,"I remember when I first saw the original I thought it was the scariest film I had ever seen. On subsequent viewings I became more aware of the levels of craft and thought that went into this ground-breaking film. So you could say I was looking forward to the sequel, but even then I had my reservations. I was right to be reticent. What I got was Rambo in space with all the levels of forethought, scriptwriting skills and character development that made films like Commando and the Rambos etc. what they were - very bad movies. The makers of Aliens missed the point of the original completely - the original alien was scary because they couldn't kill it, the characters were imperfect and real and had real fears - in this gungho rubbish the aliens get splattered all over the place and the characters seemed only scared that the director might not get their best angle. So what we were left with was less than indestructible aliens and cardboard cut-out characters from the gungho 80s - the decade not quickly enough forgotten."
constanza-nm,"Aug 17, 2024",5/10,"I'm actually surprised of the rating on this movie. I've just recently saw the original Alien, I didn't have big expectations I've never been a big fan of neither science fiction or monsters horror but ten minutes in and I was already hook. The first thing that captured my attention was the cinematography, there isn't one bad shot on that film, it looks beautiful. The sets design and overall world building is great. Even without knowing anything about that world you feel like you're part of it and it absolutely feels like it's happening in out space. This one on the other hand, could be anywhere, it's more of a military base than anything else. It lacks identity. One of my favorite scenes of the original is when they talk to Mother and how they have to face the reality of being a small and insignificant part of something greater, something that they can't even begin to understand. Those themes are not even present on this sequel. A bunch of unlikable characters with terrible dialogues, a lot of guns, explosions, futuristic cars and fire. It's an action movie, nor horror or suspense. There isn't any tension. I guess if something can be redeemable is Ripley, who remains a compelling character and hers and Newt relationship, besides that the story is just weak. Ironically the reasons of why I didn't enjoy this movie are probably the ones why people like it so much. There's was definitely a time in cinema were *the bigger the better*"
mlambotinashe,"Dec 31, 2024",10/10,"James Cameron's 1986 sci-fi action film ""Aliens"" is a masterpiece that has stood the test of time. This iconic sequel to Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a must-see for fans of the genre, delivering a thrilling ride that's equal parts suspenseful, emotional, and entertaining.Sigourney Weaver shines as Lieutenant Ellen Ripley, a character that has become synonymous with female empowerment. Her performance is raw, emotional, and utterly captivating, making Ripley one of the most iconic characters in cinema history.The supporting cast is equally impressive, with memorable performances from Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, and Lance Henriksen. The chemistry between the actors is palpable, making the characters' interactions feel authentic and engaging.Cameron's direction is superb, expertly balancing action, suspense, and emotional moments. The film's pacing is relentless, with barely a moment to catch your breath between intense set pieces. The special effects, which were groundbreaking at the time of the film's release, still hold up today, with the Xenomorphs remaining one of the most terrifying creatures in sci-fi history.The themes of ""Aliens"" are timeless, exploring the consequences of playing with forces beyond human control and the importance of maternal instinct. Ripley's character arc is particularly compelling, as she confronts her own demons and finds a new sense of purpose in protecting the young girl Newt.The film's action sequences are legendary, with the iconic ""Power Loader"" exosuit scene being a particular highlight. The sound design and cinematography are equally impressive, immersing the viewer in the film's tense and foreboding atmosphere.In short, ""Aliens"" is a sci-fi classic that has aged remarkably well. With its suspenseful storyline, memorable characters, and groundbreaking special effects, it's a must-see for fans of the genre. If you haven't seen it, do yourself a favor and experience this iconic film._Recommendation:_ If you enjoy films like ""The Terminator,"" ""Predator,"" or ""The Thing,"" you'll love ""Aliens."""
jsbear-4-320623,"Jan 6, 2025",9/10,"It's truly astounding how well this movie has held up over the years. I have re-watched many movies, some not nearly as old, and they feel dated. It really makes me think how genius this movie is, the special effects, set designs, and the aliens are masterfully done. Was it the lighting that helps protect the realism? Also one of the few times a sequel is as good as the original, the movies are very different, Aliens being more of an action move in my opinion.I really just wanted to highlight my thoughts on this movies longevity and relevance. Certainly one of those movies that you always stop on when flipping through the channels, only a handful of movies fill that bill for me :)"
uasmae_simoi,"Dec 18, 2019",10/10,"The further we go in special effects, the more movies show us and ignore the unseen, the more people will return to dark horrors like this one.It's hard to look at this film without considering the sequels and knowing the alien itself, however when made the alien was mostly unseen and a mystery. It's difficult to forget what you've seen, but it's important to approach this film first if possible rather than joining the series late.It's amazing that this is over 20 years old - apart from the actors looking so young, the film doesn't feel dated at all. The sci-fi visions here are still bleak and futuristic as they were then - this is not the Star Trek vision of the future. The foreboding exists long before John Hurt spills his secret, Scott's direction is excellent throughout. Once the alien is ""born"" the tension is cranked up and the characters dispatched one by one (a formula we know oh-so well now!)"
IonicBreezeMachine,"Jun 4, 2022",9/10,"57 years after surviving the alien on board the Nostromo, Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is found on board her shuttle and returned to Earth, but 57 years have passed. Ripley is debriefed by the Weyland-Yutani Corporation who dispute her claims of an alien creature as well as the Ash synthetic who was allegedly operating under orders to secure the alien lifeform at the expense of the crew and Ripley is effectively sidelined in her career as she's the only one left to blame for the loss of the Nostromo. In the years since the incident, the moon where the alien came from, LV-426, has since become a terraforming colony with a population of about 70 families. When contact is lost with LV-426, Ripley is approached by company representative Carter Burke (Paul Reiser) to serve as a consultant on a rescue mission along side a team of Colonial Marines. As Ripley reluctantly agrees to join them, they soon find that the alien threat is even greater this time around.After the success of Alien, Brandywine Productions had been keen on doing a sequel as was 20th Century Fox head Alan Ladd Jr. Before Ladd left the studio to form his own company. With the change in management Fox became heisitant on a sequel and further delayed matters by using Hollywood accounting to claim that Alien had actually been a loss for the studio despite being one of the highest grossing films of the year. This resulted in Fox and Brandywine suing each other with the two eventually settling out of court when Fox agreed to greenlight the sequel. Legendary producer Lawrence Gordon was hugely instrumental in getting James Cameron's treatment and direction for the Alien sequel after the sleeper success of The Terminator, and Cameron himself was also instrumental in keeping Sigourney Weaver for the film as Fox were worried about a salary increase but Cameron stood fast and was helped by Lawrence Gordon. After years of stonewalling by Fox and attempts by them at undermining Brandywine and James Cameron, the movie was released to critical acclaim especially for Weaver's performance and even greater box office than the first film. Aliens stands as a testament to the possibilities of sequels and how they can build upon what was great in the original while still allowing themselves to take risks.While the first Alien was all about being Isolated and vulnerable with no hope of rescue from the outside, Aliens is about the isolation of war as Ripley and our team of marines find themselves surrounded by a faceless enemy seemingly with no end to their attackers as what at first seems like a rescue mission turns into a fight just to survive. The LV-426 moon is put to solid use in its ghost town type appearance where something horrible has happened, and the mixture of inorganic alien resin mixed with the gold grey steel of the colony's corridors makes for unsettling atmosphere in this labyrinth our heroes must survive. The effects this time are by Stan Winston who takes the original H. R. Giger design and builds upon it with his team of technicians to create some truly great sights.Much like the original film, Aliens gives us a solid ensemble. Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Academy Award for her performance as Ripley and deservedly so as she portrays a broken person out of time and out of place driven to stop the aliens from doing to anyone else what was done to her. In the extended director's cut the performance is made even more powerful with added scenes detailing Ripley's loss of her daughter Amanda to old age which only adds to the emotional weight of the performance, and had the director's cut been released in theaters I have no doubt Weaver would've won that award for her performance because of how heart wrenching it is. Carrie Henn is also quite good as a little girl the marines find on the planet who's managed to survive for weeks by scavenging food and avoiding the aliens, and the relationship between her and Ripley while already good is also improved by the director's cut. The team of marines is filled with solid actors like Cameron's staples Michael Biehn, Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton, and many others, but Paul Reiser is great as the company representative Carter Burke who serves as a secondary antagonist and is perfect in the role as his smooth talking negotiator surface conceals a darker more exploitative core.Aliens does what a good sequel should do: up the ante while maintaining the original core. From Weaver's great performance, James Cameron's intense direction, and a solid ensemble the movie delivers everywhere it should. The action sequences are intense and the atmosphere is so thick you can cut it with a knife. Much like the original Alien, Aliens has also served as a benchmark in the genre with scores of imitators trying to copy the formula."
dav07dan02,"Sep 27, 2005",6/10,"Director/Script: James Cameron, Cast: Sigourney Weaver, Carrie Henn, Paul Riser, Lance Henriksen, Michael BiehnPicking up right where the previous film left of, Ripley is wakened out of hypersleep by a salvage crew 57 years after the ship left the alien planet. She is brought back to the 'company' where she tells the story of what happened to the the rest of the crew. However, they don't believe her because the planet is now colonized with about 60 families living on it with no altercations. Evuantally, they loose contact with the colony so they want to send a group of marines to investigate and they want Ripley to go along as an adviser due to her knowledge of the planet. After they arrive on the planet, they discover that the whole colony has been massacred shy of a little boy and girl. The marines become victim.These alien films are rather interesting to review because they are all so different and fans of the series have such passionate differences of opinion as to what their favorite one is, most people favoring the first two. Aliens may be second only to the Star Wars films in the loyal following it gets from its fans. Aliens is unique amongst sequels in that it is actually favored by many fans. No doubt about it, this is a very effective film. It's got good special effects, cinematography, and action sequences. This plays much more like an action film than the previous. James Cameron did not want to duplicate Ridly Scott's film so he took a whole different direction. He had earlier made the Terminator with Arnold Schwarzenegger which was also an action sci-fi. Scott's first Alien film was a much darker film with more elements of horror.I am going to go against many fans (thank God IMDb doesn't list reviewers addressees!) but I was disappointed somewhat with this film. It's not a bad film by any means but I just don't think they were able to capture the same level of mystery or horror in this film which is also why I actually preferred the third one to this. I also felt this film to be to talky especially at the beginning. The marines where an overzealous, arrogant bunch much like the characters in Armagaden (although not that bad!). The crew in the first film were much more subdued in fact I'm not so sure they even liked each other! Anyhow, this is a good film overall but I am more of a fan of the first film."
xnmwwnsdt,"Oct 16, 2021",10/10,"This is an epic film which really feels like it takes you through a journey.It has a stella cast with Weaver playing a excellent strong female protagonist who matches well with the solid supporting cast. There are a number of incredibly quotable lines & now iconic characters.The special effects stand up well even now, which is helped by the excellent design of the aliens,If you have not seen this film I would throughly recommend it & it's predecessor Alien, sadly the franchise would go onto provide diminishing returns but this is truly a movie which had a massive impact on pop culture."
wisdomwasp,"Jan 19, 2025",8/10,"This was a great sequel, rather than redoing the Alien slow building horror route, this was an action film, more or less through and through with enough scares and tension to keep the viewer hooked.Its great to watch a film with a couple of truly noble, good characters who are prepared to sacrifice their lives just on the chance they could save another's.The world building is especially good, the action and tension is just as better, if not improved on the original. The use of Space Seals (or was it marines) is a cool touch and gives it a Predator vibe - each soldier brings something different. No need to even watch the first if not your thing!"
neozastrow820,"Feb 16, 2010",9/10,"Well, Alien is without a Science fiction/horror classic, but the 1986 sequel is the kind of film that in some ways surpasses the original, and can also do the series justice (corny I know) and pretty much becomes one of the most original, special effects gold, acted greatly (Weaver can't get much better than this), and exciting to watch sequels of all time! The music is some of the best i've herd of Goldsmith, if he composed, the way it sounds like something by todays standers and can really grab you're attention.The character development is better than I expected, seeing as you come to know these Marines and relate to us (much like in The Thing, one of my favorites.)The special effects are so good, most people say ""this move is way ahead of it's time!"" My response is, Agreed.The plot is at first view (for people we aren't SciFci nerds, I'm one) hard to understand, unless you watch this movie many times, What I did with the Thing.The quotes are really memorable; such as ""GAME OVER MAN! GAME OVVVERRR!!!"" or ""Get away from her, YOU BITCH!!! I love the dialogue, it's just plain good.Overall, watch this film if you enjoyed T2: Judgement day, The Thing, Alien, or Invasion of The Body Snatchers, or just want to have a thrilling, epic, long (I have the uncut version), cool, outstanding, groundbreaking, or just plain great this October, then you need to see ""Aliens"""
RM851222,"Mar 13, 2008",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Aliens"" (1986) is my favorite film of all time, and i'm a huge fan of Alien franchise. The first ""Alien"" was and still is an unmatched cinematic masterpiece of pure terror, suspence and an example still of how to craft an examplary film. ""Aliens"" on its hands is a relentless science fiction action thriller. What can i say about this movie that wasn't told hundreds time before? Excellent and perfect. Those are only words that can describe this movie. Directing by Mr. James Cameron was perfect. Acting is highly involving - each and every character are simple yet memorable because of excellent dialogs and pitch perfect acring. Cinematography is claustrophobic yet epic when it needs to showcase the scope of events and situations. But its the editing so brilliant that elevated its material above and beyond. Special effects were cutting edge back on the day and they still holds up strong even in 2025. Sound design is amazing, while music by James Horner created this pulse pounding film unforgettable and literally a journey into a rabbit hole. And there is Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley - best female action heroine of all time! Her dinamic with Newt and supporting characters is what makes ""Aliens"" work above and better then its material. And the late great Bill Paxton really deserved an Oscar nomination that year - his Hudson is unforgettable character.Overall, rewatching ""Aliens"" every time during decades i got from it something new almost each time. The overall mood and suspension will never be the same again as it was created in this film. When this film ends you literally feel as exhausted as its characters on screen. This is a brilliant film in every single department created by all time great James Cameron. This is in my opinion the best sequel ever made matched by only Terminator 2 and Godfather Part 2. It's as good as movies go."
estebangonzalez10,"Jun 20, 2012",8/10,"¨We'd better get back, 'cause it'll be dark soon, and they mostly come at night¨Many people consider Aliens to be better or at least at the same level as its predecessor, Alien, but I found it an inferior film in many ways. In my opinion Alien is a perfect film, while Aliens despite being very entertaining is not nearly as scary and has its flaws. This sequel was directed by James Cameron and his trademarks are all over this film. Ridley Scott had managed to direct a small psychological science fiction horror flick, while Cameron made a much larger film, with many aliens, more characters, and a lot more action. This is more of a blockbuster movie than anything else. I've always been a fan of much quieter films that focus on psychological scares than big budget action movies so that may be one of the reasons why I liked Alien much more than Aliens. There is no doubt about Cameron's ability to direct these big budget movies and he always delivers spectacular visual effects, but story wise his films are sometimes lacking in quality. The characters are many times one dimensional and that is exactly the case in Aliens. The only character I really liked in this film and that has depth is Sigourney Weaver's Ripley. Unlike in Alien where the main character seemed to be the alien despite not showing up much on screen; in Aliens we have plenty of screen time for the aliens, but I never felt like they were a main character. It's as if so much overexposure to them made me care less about the aliens and more about Ripley. So in conclusion Alien was the creature's movie, while Aliens is Weaver's film. She has a very strong role and her presence is what has made this film so successful. She carries the film and in a way makes us forget about the rest of the one dimensional characters. The story continues right where the original left off with Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) in the Nostromo shuttle in hypersleep along with her cat. She is awaken by a salvage team that has found her vessel drifting through space. Burke (Paul Reiser), who works for the same company that the original crew members worked for, informs Ripley that she has been asleep for 57 years. The company briefs Ripley as to what happened with the ship and the rest of the members, and don't believe her story. They say that if her story were true then the colony of over 60 families that has been living on the planet where she claims to have seen the derailed ship would have encountered the aliens by now. The colony has been there for over twenty years without experiencing difficulties, and Ripley is discharged as a space pilot. Some time later, when the company loses contact with the colony, Burke asks Ripley to come along with them as a consultant. The company sends a military team to find out what has happened to the colonists and Ripley is offered to come along with them reinstating her if she does so. This is just an excuse for Cameron to get the crew in the same planet as the aliens and have much more action. Ripley decides to travel with the team which consists of Lt. Gorman (William Hope), the android Bishop (Lance Henriksen), Cpl. Hicks (Michael Biehn), Pvt. Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein), Pvt. Hudson (Bill Paxton), Cpl. Ferro (Colette Hiller), among many other soldiers who are heavily armed and qualified. Once they reach the planet they find no sign of any colonists, except for a ten year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn) who has managed to survive and tells them that monsters have killed the rest, and that they will come for them as well.This film marked a breakthrough in action films, but isn't really as scary as the original movie. The suspense and psychological horror is replaced with action packed shootouts and explosions. There are many more characters and a lot more aliens so there are a lot of things happening. This is what makes Aliens more entertaining for some people. Cameron had recently come from directing The Terminator so he was already making a name for himself and was able to work with a good budget. He is among the best when it comes to visuals and special effects and many of the visuals in this movie still look great today. Aliens won two Oscars for this reason. I'm not a huge fan of Cameron's work, although I have to admit Terminator 2 is one of the best action movies ever and definitely my favorite James Cameron film. The screenplay was also written by Cameron along with the help of screenwriters David Giler and Walter Hill, and I had small issues with it, although the spectacular action sequences saved it. This is Sigourney Weaver's film and she truly broke out as an A-list actress with this movie. She shines as a true female action hero who's strong and emotional at the same time. Aliens is a good film, just not as perfect as Alien.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
garyk05,"Nov 2, 2005",10/10,"At around 10 years old i watched aliens and it gave me nightmares for weeks!!! I couldn't bring myself to watch it for years and when i did it blew me away. Everything about it, characters, scenes, props(pulse rifle, possibly the best movie prop of all time???) the whole shah-bang. It was a movie light years ahead of its time and showcased James Cameron in my eyes as one of the worlds top directors. There really isn't enough you can say about this movie, its just a shame the following films didn't live up to expectation. Does anyone else notice that it doesn't matter how many times you watch it different things appear that you never noticed before? Suppose thats partly what makes you go back to watch it over and over again!"
bob the moo,"Oct 17, 2001",N/A,"Starting with an excellent scare twist this film picks up years after Ripley's first encounter with the alien. It transpires that the planet where the first alien was discovered has been populated by a science colony. Ripley is sent with a military unit to discover why the colony has lost contact with earth.Cameron really took a risk here in following up one of the most famous sci-fi's ever.  However he takes Scott's vision and expands it to bring in more terror and more plot.  This situation sees more aliens, more action and introduces the sub-plot that the Government would surely be keen to capture any creature capable of killing enemies.  It's a terrifying thought in itself - all the more terrifying because it is very likely to be true!In terms of the action scenes the film tries to stay close to the atmosphere of the original and the terror of the aliens.  In this it succeeds, opening up what we know about the creatures and keeping the scenes darkly lit and moody.  Even though we see more of the creatures the shadows still keep the feeling of the unknown.Weaver is good and is surrounded by several well known character actors (Biehn, Paxton, Henriksen, Reiser) but there is little room for character development.  The fact that Ripley has slept while everyone she knows has died is not really investigated that much.  However this is a minor complaint about a classic action movie.It was never going to be easy to follow the original but Cameron does a good job.  However where the original movie was a sci-fi horror movie this is a main stream sci-fi action movie with guns and explosions taking away from the horror."
avik-basu1889,"Jan 1, 2016",7/10,"'Aliens' is the 2nd film in the Alien film franchise and probably the most popular film in the aforementioned franchise. Written and directed by James Cameron, this film begins after the events in Ridley Scott's 'Alien'. Ripley survives after her escape vessel is recovered after drifting across the galaxy while being in cryogenic sleep for 57 years. On Earth, no one believes her story about the events on the planet LV-426 which she experienced and she loses her licence. The Weyland-Yutani Corporation had already ordered the colonisation of LV-426 during Ripley's extended absence. But suddenly all communication with the colony gets lost and the company decides to send a team of tough, rugged, space marines to investigate the situation along with Ripley to help them with her knowledge.James Cameron did something exceedingly brave when he decided to practically change the genre in the sequel to an immensely popular original film. While Ridley Scott's 'Alien' was sci-fi horror with elements of tension and claustrophobia, Cameron's 'Aliens' even though it still retains some of the slow tension building in the 1st half, is basically a straight up action blockbuster which makes it much more accessible to the general masses. It has the 80s written all over it. This film raises the stakes and makes everything bigger and louder than 'Alien'. There are explosions, there are machine guns, and this time instead of one, Ripley along with the other marines faces a whole army of Xenomorphs. The film again looks beautiful and the visuals hold up on Blu Ray. Cameron's craft as a director can't be doubted after watching this. Cameron holds the tension in the first half and then bombards the viewer with one brutal action set-piece after another in the second half.When it comes to the themes, Cameron actually retains the theme of the ill-effects of capitalism that was a part of 'Alien'. But although this capitalism angle does appear in 'Alien', Ridley Scott was a little more subtle, while I felt Cameron went a bit overboard to drive home the evil corporation element in the storyline and at times it became slightly unrealistic. Another element is of course feminism. Ripley, I believe becomes the true action hero in this film more than in 'Alien'. She overcomes all the naysayers above her in the hierarchy and truly owns her power and evolves into a truly powerful woman. We also clearly see strong themes of motherhood running throughout the film which again is handled in a slightly overt way. But there also hints at racism in the script and this racism theme I think is what Cameron handles the best with the requisite amount of nuance.Unfortunately, this film didn't have the lingering effect that 'Alien' had in my mind. I preferred 'Alien's subtlety over the big and blockbuster feel of this film. The grand scale of the action sequences in this film genuinely makes 'Alien' look like an indie horror film. But I thought the endless action sequences although very well directed in the end to some extent diluted the overall effect and at times went into ridiculous territory. The film also has a number of endings like 'Return of the King'. There are also certain relationships that are forged in the course of the narrative that made me correctly predict who is going to live in the end and who won't.Sigourney Weaver is absolutely brilliant in this film. She richly deserved the Oscar nomination. She conveys every emotion possible in the film be it frustration, love, anger or fear. She also completely commits to the role and becomes a compelling action hero. Ripley evolves from the role of indefatigable survivor in 'Alien' to the role of the tough, bad-ass mother in this film. Although most of the characters in 'Aliens' lack the realism and are not as believable as the Nostromo crew in 'Alien', but they are entertaining and funny. I'll give a special mention to Bill Paxton, Jenette Goldstein and Michael Biehn.'Aliens' is a film that I can enjoy a lot and watch over and over again. But every time I do, it somehow fails to stick in my mind for too long due to the over-dependence on action sequences. It is a big 80s action film that is one of the best of its genre, but still in my eyes not as deep and satisfying as the original film in the series."
Billiam-4,"Sep 10, 2021",7/10,"Sensible sequel to a sci-fi classic and upping the ante on suspense and action, although there are some silly moments (alien mother riding the elevator)."
cinemais4life,"Jul 4, 2022",10/10,"My favorite movie of all time. It's one of those rare movies that is completely perfect in almost every aspect you can think of. The setting, the characters, the dialogue, the visual design, the writing, the storytelling, the pacing, and the acting. Oh my gosh, this movie is really one of the greatest movies ever made. It might probably be the best sequel of all time. It perfectly follows the story without changing or ignoring the stuff that happened in the original movie. It also has nothing but practical effects and miniatures in the action sequences and sets that makes this blow most of the CGI-filled 'movies' out of the water. And guess what, it has a strong female lead character. But the reason why this works is because there was no woke identity politics or forced diversity to pander to the soy filled SJW leftists on social media and Twitter because this wasn't even a thing in 1986. What mattered was actual good storytelling and writing which is the reason why most movies suck. ""We're on express elevator to hell, goin' down!"" Keep on rockin' on, Aliens!"
iainesmith,"Nov 27, 2017",10/10,"One of the greatest monster movies of all time. Some of the best sets, special effects, score, acting and scenes of any movie of it's time if not all time. Such brilliant actors, Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser, Bill Paxton and many more great performances. This movie has humor as well as scary thrilling moments. A well acted, shot and edited movie to rival any other."
nick-201,"Apr 24, 1999",10/10,"This is probably my favorite movie, period. Just about everything is perfect, the cast, the storyline, the effects (except the guys in the rubber suits in the ""tunnels""). My only real squawk is the music that James Horner ripped off (from himself!!) from Star Trek II, The wrath of Khan! When the ""vehicle""is running around, it's the same music as the battle scenes in ST2TWOK! This movie shows how sci-fi/action should and could be done, and everytime I think about it, I think of what Jurassic Park could have been with Cameron directing/writing, and given a Titanic budget! If it would have been done half as well as the book, it would have been one of the all time greats. If you never read the book, do it, and see if I'm wrong....."
Dany23,"Nov 4, 2022",10/10,"I only watched this film recently, and it's really weathered the test of time brilliantly. Was on the edge of my seat biting my nails, the tension was electric, the aliens are scary (the practical effects are great! Better than some CGI I've seen recently). Last but certainly not least, Sigourney Weaver is fantastic. I wish I'd watched this sooner.Ripley is a true masterclass in a good female character: capable, caring, tough as nails, and smart as hell.(Minor aside: I particularly loved Ripley's practical shoes and hair, a gripe I have watching action movies is the female action hero with loose flowing locks wearing sky-high heels while in close combat. It's ridiculous. Somehow it keeps happening, even in 2022!)"
santiroig,"Apr 30, 2023",10/10,"This is my favorite movie of all time. Everything about it is spectacular. The special effects, the casting, the acting, everything is perfect. This is one of my favorite James Cameron movies and is one of the greatest films of all times. The movie itself is a great thing to watch. I'm always very exited to show this movie to people who have not seen it before. I think that every human being should at least know about this movie franchise. This is in my opinion the best installment of the franchise and is an excellent film in general. More people should watch this movie to appreciate the great movie that it is."
nbfcblog,"Jan 25, 2018",10/10,"One of those rare sequels that is better than the first movie in every way.James Cameron manages to take everything that was great about Ridley Scott's original 1979 film and builds on top of it to make a superior sequel.It not only maintains the claustrophobic atmosphere of the first, but I found the characters more endearing and memorable (Ex. Hicks, Hudson, Vasquez) this time around.The action is great, the creature designs are better, and the visuals are simply awesome. The Queen Alien is one of the greatest monsters ever put on screen and it's amazing that the effects were all done in camera.Aliens also feels more textured from a character and writing perspective. I love the Vietnam War/Starship Trooper aesthetic (I personally like this movie better than the actual Starship Trooper movie) and the underlying themes of motherhood that is further accented in the extended cut.I also liked how Ripley is upgraded to be an action heroine and Cameron showcases this transition perfectly. It all felt perfectly natural and in keeping with the logic of the story (I'M LOOKING AT YOU FORCE AWAKENS!!).James Cameron back in his heyday really understood that in order for all this action and spectacle to matter, you need to have compelling relatable characters to anchor it.It kinda bothers me that there is this growing trend of stereotyping the film as a ""dumber action shoot-em up"" version of Alien, which baffles me to no end.Seriously, it's nearly a full hour before any gun is fired and there is literally zero moments in this story where the marines have the upper hand."
bennhogan,"Jan 26, 2021",7/10,The first film is great. In the first film the alien is some mysterious unstoppable force and James Cameron takes this idea and chucks it out the window. The aliens are killed so easily in this movie and doesn't fit in with the first film at all.
Andy44,"Mar 13, 2005",2/10,"Alien was a classic; this sequel is flashy junk.In Alien we saw ordinary people dealing with something unimaginable. We were shown their cooperation and conflict. The drastic isolation was overpowering. The technological twists were plausible. The scenes of ""discovering"" the alien were fantastic but natural.So, instead of a sequel that might involve some scientific inquiry or perhaps some narrative worthy of the cosmic ideas involved, we get: sweating warriors yelling at each other; a little girl survivor; Ripley grim and determined; hordes of monsters; a sneaky slimeball; lots of noise and Saturday afternoon serial ""suspence""This script is about as creative as a 13 year-old's fantasy. Actually I think a lot of 13 year-olds could have done better.Unless a sequel really honors the original, it's just parasitic."
ma-cortes,"Mar 29, 2015",8/10,"Stirring and superior sequel with plenty of thrills , intrigue , suspense , disgusting special effects and lots of blood and gore . The planet from Alien I (1979) has been colonized, but contact is lost . This sequel deals with an invincible squad of G.I.Joes (Michael Biehn , Bill Paxton , Al Matthews , Mark Rolston , Jenette Goldstein and several others) with breathtaking firepower commanded by a Lt. (William Hope) , being accompanied by Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) , a chief (Paul Reiser) of 'The Company' and again an android (Lance Henriksen) ; all of them go to the dangerous planet Alien . The rescue team has to confront an incredible power in a titanic fight .Nail-biting outing contains tension from start to finish , gory scenes aplenty , some strong scares , slime , emotion , entertainment and nice acting . This follow-up to Alien is also visually astounding , being masterfully realized by James Cameron with a good cast as Paul Reiser , Jenette Goldstein , Lance Henriksen , Michael Biehn , among others . All of the cast who were to play the Marines with the exception of Michael Biehn, who replaced James Remar one week into filming were trained by the S.A.S. , Special Air Service, Britain's elite special operations unit for two weeks before filming . Here Sigourney Weaver/Ripley stands out as one of the best action women of the cinema history . Sigourney Weaver's Best Actress Academy Award nomination for this movie was the first ever for an actress in an action role in an action movie . Moving and thrilling story by Walter Hill , David Giler and the same Cameron ; based on ""Alien"" characters created by Ronald Shusett and Dan O'Bannon . This exciting as well as heart-pounding movie contains shocks , stomach-churning violence , being packed with frenetic action , thrills and results to be pretty entertaining . It is a very good cinematic combination of Sci-Fi , monster movie and terror . This is a brutal , considerable violent and overwhelming sci-fi thriller that scales new heights of savagery even by the standards of the 70s , 80s , 90s and even 2000s . The result is a throughly violent but undeniably impressive action movie with an acceptable cast giving sweatily good value to their abrasive characters . Magnificently designed creatures , originally created by the artist HR Giger . Top-notch special effects by SFX designer Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff Jr . Although , only six alien suits were used, and even then they were mostly just a handful of latex appliances on black leotards , the appearance of hundreds of aliens is simply clever editing and planning, and lighting plus slime helped make the ""suits"" more solid. The Animatronics were controlled by a motion-control rig which could save her rapid movements . The ending part is particularly exciting with our protagonist battling the malicious as well as brutal alien mother and with impressive scenes that took various months to film . The picture packs an enjoyable music score by maestro James Horner , full of fury and frightening sounds , though he cannibalized previous scores he had done, such as elements from his Star Trek II -wrath of Khan (1982) and Star Trek III (1984) scores . Furthermore , a colorful and adequate cinematography by Adrian Biddle . The motion picture lavishly produced by Gordon Carroll , David Giler , Walter Hill and Gale Anne Hurd was perfectly directed by the great James Cameron .There was seven years between the release of Alien (1979) and Aliens (1986), six between Aliens and Alien 3 (1992), and five between Alien³ and Alien resurrection (1997). The original and the best was ¨Alien¨ by Ridley Scott , it was starred by Sigourney Weaver as a great action woman similarly to Sanaa Lathan ; it is followed by this ¨Aliens¨, considered to be its better sequel . All of them starred by the great Sigourney Weaver who performed one of the best female leads created in years followed by Sanaa Lathan . Furthermore, ¨Alien vs. Predator¨ (2004) that was first film in the ""Alien"" franchise to not feature Sigourney Weaver, who has said in interviews the idea of the crossover ""sounded awful¨ and ¨Aliens vs. Predator ¨ (2004) by Paul W.S. Anderson with Sanaa Lathan , Raoul Bova , Ewen Bremner , Tommy Flanagan , Joseph Rye . Followed by ¨AVPR: Aliens vs Predator - Réquiem¨ (2007) by Colin Strause and Greg Strause with Steven Pasquale , Reiko Aylesworth , John Ortiz , Johnny Lewis , Kristen Hager , Ariel Gade , Sam Trammell , Gina Holden , Ty Olsson and Robert Joy ."
sugarRay-4,"May 20, 1999",10/10,"I think this movie is the best movie made.  The graphic violence, it's realism in a non-realistic way, and the acting made it a high quality film. I've ordered the directors cut that comes out June 1, 1999.  I can't weight for the new stuff."
Paragon240,"Jul 21, 2022",10/10,"The original Alien (1979) set a new standard for sci-fi horror due to the fantastic vision and directing of the legendary director Ridley Scott. How could a green rookie director with just a handful of directing credits hope to top that? James Cameron found a way! Aliens improves on its predecessor in every way. Instead of a crew of civilian pilots fighting to survive a single alien, Cameron pits a squad of hardened space marines against an alien infestation. The experience, training, and advanced weaponry fail to protect them from the onslaught of alien xenomorphs, increasing the horror and hopelessness of the film. Cameron's camera work and perspective increase the tension, regularly showing the struggling survivors from the viewpoint of the stalking alien predator. The special effects, the action, the scale, the cast, the directing, the horror, and every other element of Aliens improve on the masterpiece of the original and result in the absolute gold standard of sci-fi horror."
dk777,"Feb 8, 2021",10/10,"A worthy sequel to one of the best sci-fi horror ever.
A spectacular film with a tense atmosphere full of interesting characters.
The cast is great, and Sigourney Weaver is perfect as Ellen Ripley.
The cinematography is excellent, as well as the directing and the film is
impressive and interesting.
A great combination of science fiction, horror and war film.
A lot of effort has been put into this film and it shows, the

Practical effects, when done so well, always look better and
more convincing than CGI.
An unforgettable cinematic experience."
BradenTheRater,"Aug 19, 2025",8/10,"""Aliens"" is not your usual run of the mill cash grab Sequel that is a million times worse than the original. It lives up to the hype of ""Alien"" but the only reason ""Alien"" has a higher rating is the first one is more thrilling, suspenseful, and it's more of a psychological thriller while ""Aliens"" is a more action sci-fi film with less gory scenes and gives lot less horror vibe. One last criticism I have with the movie is that the entire movie is extremely predictable, and during the action scenes, you can't see a single thing or what the heck is happening.In terms of parental guides, Alien is a much better movie, mainly because of the INSANE amount of swearing and dark humor. F-Bombs are dropped almost every minute and other curses are used like s***, a**, and b****. Also you might just get plain scared. (if you are a eight year old that for some reason wants ""Aliens."")In conclusion, I made Aliens sound like a horrible movie, but I'm comparing it to one of the best. It's still extremely good, trust me. Anyways, if you want to watch a true sci-fi classic, then this is the movie for you."
clf-73998,"Jun 28, 2021",6/10,"Aliens breaks the ""acid blood rule"" to become a movie about shooting at things that move in space. It's exactly like the Ridley Scott movie after removing all character development, pathos, morality, story and weight. But James Cameron does a good job of making it all look pretty. What a fantastically boring populism popcorn flic."
eva3si0n,"Feb 27, 2021",10/10,"Aliens is a showcase sequel. An excellent film expanding the universe, not as auntic as the original. But more dynamic. Cameron managed to make an excellent film, which surpassed in many ways the original. Suspense is at an excellent level throughout the film."
RonellSowes,"Oct 15, 2022",8/10,Aliens is perhaps the arguably the best sequel. James Cameron was taking on no small feat with making a follow up to a film as strong as Alien but he knew exactly where to take it. While the previous was a sci-fi horror with one monster killing off members of ship this was a sci-fi action with Earth's toughest taking the fight to a colony of xenomorphs. Its intelligently done and though it's a bit long at a 137 minutes each of those is time well used in this action packed adventure-thriller. Aliens joins the ranks of many great movies with the fact that it breaks genres it combines so many different aspects into this one complete film. Of course the star of the film is Sigourney Weaver as Ripley but Michael Biehn is something of a co-lead for the better part of this film and he delivers. It's puzzling how The Terminator and Aliens didnt lead to a larger action movie career for him because he's terrific in both.

Stubsy Magee,"Feb 6, 2025",10/10,"If you have seen Ridley Scott's Alien, you know it's a masterpiece. How could you one up it possibly? It will forever be up for debate, but James Cameron's Aliens comes about as close as it gets.Continuing with Sigourney Weaver's heroine Ripley, we go from claustrophobic horror to downright pulse pounding action. Stan Winston's (practical) special effects throw you right into a couple hours of edge of your seat movie making. If your jaw isn't on the floor during the last half hour at least, consult a physician. Plus if you can, always watch the Directors Cut (Special Edition). There is just more to love. Any science fiction fan will be drooling on every watch..."
LambChop21,"Dec 30, 2021",9/10,"The greatest Sci-fi action movie ever made , objectively (my personal favourite is Predator) but this is just unmatched as a complete production. On the edge, immersive and atmospheric, perfect pacing are some of the accolades here that modern film-making can't seem to replicate."
cormacfiggis,"Aug 6, 2022",10/10,"Arguably the best sequel of the eighties. The last hour is about as edge-of-the-seat, toe curlingly tense as you will see. You'll need a stiff drink or a holiday."
pontram,"Apr 18, 2009",N/A,"When I saw ""Aliens"" more than 20 years ago, I didn't like it because of the military presence. I didn't like the Army, and I didn't believe that in the future such an armed rabble would be used to make something like 'first contact' with possibly precious xenomorphs. I disliked the complete crew, and my understanding was that the movie was sympathizing with them. Maybe I was wrong and it is all humor, and the Army is satirized. I'm not that intelligent, you should know.At first, I liked the introduction. Ripley aged only a few years during her 57 years hibernation, I found that time line a good Idea. Unfortunately, script writer's imagination could not transport the effects of this half century, on the contrary, technology, clothing and behavior mention more a regression than improvement.First laugh (in a bad sense) was, when Ripley was accused for destroying her worthy freighter Nostromo. Of course was the Nostromo worthy like a supertanker, but isn't a ship of this size and the cargo insured ? They had 57 years to get the insurance sum, so what's up with this future ?Later it comes out that the contact to the colony on the Alien egg planet is lost. Surely they had no opportunity to report what happened. A colony around an expensive atmospheric modifier doesn't give any reports about what's happening or any dangerous incidents.Someone in the movie says that it lasts decades to transform a planets atmosphere. Meanwhile the colonists, which are obviously researching the surface, didn't find any trace from the huge stranded spaceship, which sent the distress call that led the Nostromo to her final destruction in the first movie. OK, colonists are dumb or simply blind.Also dumb are the marines. Confrontated with Ripley who is the last survivor of a deadly alien encounter, they are not willing to hear anything what she says. I as their officer would have made them shut up immediately, because every information could be important for surviving. If soldiers of the future are such idiots as shown here, there would be no need for powerful aliens to destroy humanity.I can't imagine that any officer wouldn't send artificial drones ahead to research the situation. I can't imagine, too, that anyone would send such a small and dumb team to investigate the possible alien-caused death of 70 families. The mission in the later ""AVP"" movie is much better prepared with scientists from all over the world. OK, here we have Bishop, but he doesn't seem to be very helpful, and he has no rights to make decisions. A few more Bishop's, especially for fighting purposes, would have made the mission more serious.The greatest disappointment in ""Aliens"" is the disappearance of the alien's being nearly indelible. When the alien in the first movie is not even destroyed by the escape pod's jet engines (it's adapting to the heat, i suppose), it is here like destroying cockroaches. You can squish them with your car, you can shoot them, or simple burn with a standard flamethrower. A bunch of well-armed soldiers with a little bit more brain than the people shown in this movie would be able to eliminate a complete alien population. For what purpose would the military use such a weak race defies me. Sure, you can infest a planet of your enemies, you don't have to care about them any more. But then your own world would be also in danger because of the revenge of the survivors. And the infested world is useless. However, I know, military is always interested in new and dangerous toys.The mystery of the aliens and the other race - the big stoned guy - from the first movie is completely gone. It is simply a bug slashing feature film. When they find out that the colonists have already caught two living facehuggers, Burke's mission would be done. Instead, they are going ahead for certain death.There are many errors in the script. One is, how did Burke mange to put the facehugger to Ripley's sleeping place. Did he carry the containment tank, or did he carry the alien under his arm ? Then, there is the first confrontation between the Queen and Ripley. Ripley fills the eggs with loads of ammo and explosives, Mother's bearing channel is slashed, and there is no acid burning Ripley and Newt. And in the final fight, the ladder where Ripley is hanging is always within reach for the queen's second hand. Instead, she is angrily swinging around with her free arm. And I thought (almost), come on, big lady, take the ladder, take it, please, and then eat Ripley for killing your babies. Poor mother, so big, so dumb.The positive side is, that - blinding out the mediocre script, visuals, dialogs and actors - the movie is actually thrilling. It's more thrilling than most of the movie's of it's time, and the idea to fight the queen with the cargo loading exoskeleton is really funny. I personally understood Ripleys decision to go for Newt into the burning reactor, but I also understood that the figure of Newt is only a vehicle to fill plot holes.I gave 5 stars even if it deserves six for the thrill of the hunt."
mjneu59,"Nov 2, 2010",3/10,"The sequel to Ridley Scott's repugnant (but memorable) sci-fi monster movie is nothing more than slick, professional, high intensity trash, with Sigourney Weaver reprising her role as the indomitable sole survivor of the earlier expedition. Here she returns to the planet of her nightmares with a company of marines assigned to exterminate the growing colony of voracious aliens, but unlike in the eerie, otherworldly original the emphasis now is strictly on cheap thrills: military firepower vs. insect acid slime. Writer director James Cameron clearly knows how to manipulate his audience: each shock is delivered on cue at a furious and exhausting pace, and every visceral effect (not to mention every line of formula dialogue) has been calculated to guarantee the proper response, whether laughter or revulsion or (says Weaver to alien threatening small child: ""get away from her, you bitch!"") a rousing cheer. The end result may be short on brains, but packs plenty of muscle; a lot of summer moviegoers apparently don't expect anything more."
vip_ebriega,"Feb 20, 2007",10/10,"My Take: Takes the already remarkable concept of the original and improves upon it in every way. Sequels have never been this great!(This is an extension of the review I wrote on February 2007)If ALIEN was the 2001 of monster movies, its sequel ALIENS is its STAR WARS. Here's a sequel that knows that the only thing that would satisfy its fans is to give 'em exactly what they wanted. Then ALIENS adds in a little more to that successful recipe: breathless action, gripping tension, reliable characters and the slimiest monsters in all of movie history. The result isn't only a sequel that's better than the original, its one of the best movies of the genre.Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) reawakened from here naturally-long hypersleep which began at the finale of the first ALIEN. Forward 57 years later. The world she knew was unlike anything she has seen before, but she really has no time to know anything else than this: the distant planet LV-426, the planet where they encountered the hostile space killer, has been colonized. And when communication on the LV-426 colony is lost, Ripley agrees to return to the hostile alien planet, this time, accompanied by marines, to investigate the sudden communication loss. Of course, this ain't just a technical failure. The slimy alien from the first film times 10 has overrun the colony, turning in into a dark, gooey wasteland; the perfect place for an all-out war that pits top-tech Marines against the slimiest monsters ever.As a monster movie, ALIENS gives you your due, but not contented simply to give you your money's worth, ALIENS offers more, unexpected surprises. For a monster picture, there are some genuinely pleasant characters existing here. Sigourney Weaver, who hit big time for being the most reliable female action heroine in the original ALIEN, is able to stretch the personality of her character here. This time, we are able to see Ripley's maternal instincts when she claims responsibility for the safety of Newt (Carrie Henn), a little girl who has successfully survived the apocalypse of the outside world she lives in by climbing through hidden ducts. The climax inside the exploding atmosphere processing station won't soon be forgotten, and I'm not just talking about the explosions. In fact, I bet ALIENS is one kind of film you won't soon forget. Not the words you drop on an explosive monster movie.Rating: ***** out of 5.154-min Special Edition DVD review (submitted March 10, 2009): And to think, I thought ALIENS was good enough as it is! This Special Edition DVD, which I bought a few days ago, is everything this ALIENS fan could ever want. 17 minutes of additional footage, deleted prior to the films original 1986 release, is added in able to deepen the emotions and character development of this terrific film, while it also adds an additional (though easily expendable) action scene. The first added scene shows the newly awakened Ripley discovering that her daughter has just died... at the age of 60. So much for being there on her 11th birthday. But the scene everyone will get a real kick from is the scene where we catch a glimpse of the LV-426 colony before it is overrun by aliens, as well as a look on Newt and her family. Another scene has Ripley and Hicks exchange first names, which deepens the relationship between them. Add to that, there are a few extended scenes on the Sulaco and the Colony stations, as well as the aforementioned action scene which has the aliens cleverly trying to pass through the barricade of automatic weapons. Then of course, the film is presented in a clear, pristine transfer which makes the film look good for something released back in 1986. The special features aren't big, but if the best possible way to see this modern classic is what I'm looking for, I already got my end of the bargain."
Xophianic,"Feb 1, 2000",9/10,"I do not believe the theory that all originals are better than their sequels, end of story. I think most originals are better, but any time I think of a sequel that is better than the original, two movies come to mind. One of them is Terminator 2.The other is Aliens. Aliens is by far, the best in the series of four ""Alien"" movies, and one of the greatest action/sci-fi movies of all time. As much as I enjoyed Alien, I believe that Aliens was better in many many ways.One of which are, of course, character development. Ripley is a much more interesting character in this movie than she was in the first one. You can see her determination in every move she makes. (I also recommend seeing the special edition, which has additional scenes within them. You get more of a feel for Ripley's character when you know more about her daughter.) I think the marines are extremely cool. I think Hudson is the most interesting character of all.  Gorman is very interesting too. You watch him turn from a cowardly pathetic loser to an actual brave soldier. Burke, who tried to betray the group for money, is also a great villain.The aliens themselves are much cooler. Now you can see that they aren't just brainless animals who do nothing but kill. They are actually very smart animals who do nothing but kill. In Alien there was only one, so you didn't get to see how well they work in packs, lead people into traps, guard the Queen or cut the power before going into battle. And of course, since there are more aliens that means more of them can be killed, which means more carnage and more excitement. (This also applies to the human characters).There is never a dull moment in Aliens. I love watching it over and over, it never gets boring."
nickrigato1986,"May 30, 2023",10/10,"After this film it is inexplicable how they didn't award Weaver as best actress with an oscar. What are they waiting for to give her a lifetime achievement award? That she becomes old decrepit? Aliens has all the special effects still practically unbeaten. Cameron's signature is undeniable, to the point that certain aerial scenes are reminiscent of the first Terminator. Everybody were Perfect as actors, but Bill Paxton gives that ironic and scoundrel vein to the general atmosphere and he fits beautifully. Lance Henriksen: another great key-actor to be commended forever. The ending of the film is surreal and physically impossible, in reality ripley's arm would have fractured in a second, but let's leave this sensationalist poetic license to James Cameron who saves himself scoring the maximum ranking with Bishop's quote: ""not bad for a human!"""
chuckinparis,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,I have probably watch this movie 500 times. It is the best sci-fi movie ever made. The story line is great. The acting is superb. The effects are amazing.
Spaced,"Oct 6, 1998",10/10,"Aliens is the best movie ever made for sci-fi action.  For the most part it is the best movie of all time.  Cameron used a perfect blend of action, characters, story, plot, special effects, etc. to create this masterpiece. If you haven't seen Aliens then you're missing out.The movie doesn't lean too heavily on one or the other.  For those who don't like sci-fi you can enjoy the action or visa-versa.  Those who don't like either can enjoy the story.  Or if you're like me you can enjoy them all. Nothing tops this movie.  People often say they are making the Alien-killer or whatever.  After those movies come out often is heard, ""It wasn't as good as Aliens though.""This movie rules."
dasa108,"Dec 7, 2022",10/10,"This film is a masterpiece of tension, pulse, rhythm, production, direction, music, special effects, and acting. James Cameron is a virtuoso who offers us a spectacular film that rivals the great first film directed by Riddley Scott. The characters have space to show what they are made of, their motivations and fears. As soon as the story begins to move forward, it presents us with a situation of permanent tension that grows until an extraordinary ending. Not everyone can hold the level and in this case James Cameron reaches immense heights to finally give us an ending that closes a frantic and distressing film. It is fantastic, second to none. They should not have continued with the franchise. If something cannot be improved, it should not be continued."
stryker1121,"Aug 8, 2006",N/A,"Many times replicated, never equaled, Aliens is the best action movie of all time. There is nothing that even comes very close. It's hard to articulate the effect this film has had on me. It's one of those rare cinematic experiences that doesn't spoil with time and so-called ""maturity."" The first time I saw Aliens was at a friend's house. I was 13 and I was totally blown away. I'm now 31 and Aliens still rocks my world. Where Alien is stark and slinking and great in its own way, the sequel is bombastic and balls-to-the-wall.So many scenes stand out. I'll never forget my initial viewing of the terrifying, kick-ass sequence where the creatures first attack the Space Marines (""They're all around us man!"") However, the brilliance of this film lies in the fact that the ""quiet"" scenes are as powerful as the action-packed ones: The hint of romance as Hicks demonstrates his assault rifle to Ripley; the look of despair on Ripley's face when she's told there are families colonizing the planet.I will always love Weaver for her achingly intense performance here. I've never seen another like it in the genre. The supporting cast is wonderful, as well. Standouts include Biehn (also awesome in Terminator), Henricksen, Reiser and of course Bill Paxton, who practically steals the show.You look at sci-fi/action flicks today, and most of em are soulless exercises in CGI. Cameron's models and costumed monsters are much more effective than anything George Lucas tried in the Star Wars prequels."
jovanderh28,"May 21, 2005",6/10,"I didn't think ""Aliens"" such a very great film really, even though I'm a huge Alien-Sigourney fan. In fact I thought the second of the four to be the weakest : this really was ""America saves the universe, once again"". I know that in space, no one can hear you scream, but you could hardly miss the tough talk of the marines, who, all of them, turn out to be true heroes. I think that every existing stereotype was neatly tucked into ""Aliens"" : the tough military bitch, the tough and dumb marine, the tough but not-all-that-dumb-marine, the brave little girl, the slick commercial weasel and so on... Even the score was annoying. Now I don't say I absolutely hated it, but judging from some of the comments, you might think that this is the best space-flick ever, which it definitely is not. I'm the first to accept that Ripley has managed to say frozen for fifty-something years, but not that she manages to integrate completely in the society she wakes up in, apparently in better shape than the marines. Even the little girl (who I thought quite endearing and very natural) was a better soldier than the military guys."
shakercoola,"Mar 1, 2024",7/10,"An American horror thriller and sci-fi; A story about a commercial space tug officer who joins a crew of battle-hardened marines to investigate an incident on an exomoon, but they find they are no match for what lies in wait for them. Essentially, it is a combat picture set in the future. It is visceral and has plenty of energy, successfully manipulating the audience through protracted scenes of claustrophia and then steadily building the tension that culminates in unremitting tension in the finale. As a film sequel, it could not replicate the novelty of the first film, but the marvellous craftsmanship adds a new form of distraction: better staging, better special effects, and better props, which confirm a graphic power. Sigourney Weaver is the best thing about the film, with her natural air of authority and a maternal instinct that make for an impressive 'battle of the females' idea."
sddavis63,"Feb 21, 2011",3/10,"Right off the top the movie made me shake my head with one of those ""it's just too convenient"" moments. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) - the only survivor from the first movie - is finally rescued by a salvage ship after being in ""hyper-sleep"" for 57 years. OK. She tries to brief the company that sent her and her team on the first mission on the dangerous aliens they encountered, but no one will believe her story. Why not? Because there have been human colonists on the planet now for over 20 years and there hasn't been a single report of a problem. Well, we know where this is headed, don't we. Now that Ripley's back all of a sudden contact with the colony is lost, which allows the company to send Ripley back to the planet to do battle with the aliens all over again. Apparently they were waiting for her to be found!Setting aside that moment of ultra-convenience, this movie is weaker than the original in the series. James Cameron took over the directing duties in this from Ridley Scott, and Scott's touch was missed. What made the first movie very effective was the shadowy nature of the aliens. Scott never really gave us a good look at them. They were shadowy figures which made the story quite suspenseful. Cameron dispenses with that idea completely. The aliens are front and centre once the team reaches the planet, and somehow that makes this movie less frightening than its original. Cameron (who also co-wrote the screenplay) also turns this into a pretty standard humans vs. aliens shoot out with lots of weapons and lots of explosions, etc. The characters in this seemed more one dimensional than those in the original. So you have an out of control Marine (Bill Paxton), an in control Marine (William Hope) and the requisite bad guy representing the company (Paul Reiser). Then of course there's Ripley who, while being far more aggressive here than in the original, also gets to explore her maternal side as she becomes a surrogate mother figure to Newt (Carrie Henn) - a little girl who's apparently the only survivor among the colonists. The scene in which Ripley holds the little girl tight as the alien is approaching and says to her ""close your eyes, baby"" is actually a virtual reshoot of a scene in which a mother comforts her daughter as a monster approaches them in a 1957 movie called ""The Monster Who Challenged The World."" And - wow - can Newt ever scream when scary things happen!No. I wasn't especially impressed with this movie, although I did get a laugh near the end, when Ripley appeared to do battle with the aliens inhabiting that big robot-like suit swinging away at the creatures without mercy, and I suddenly realized that - hey - that's where James Cameron got the idea for the same kind of suits the Marines used in ""Avatar!"""
anchoreddown,"Mar 24, 2010",9/10,"Holding the spot for the sequel of Alien, this film goes so much farther than what was in the original.With scaly aliens bent on destruction of humans for reproduction, each of the team members fights off the vile and cruel specie.Sigormy Weaver pulls it off again with a supporting actress, which gives off a very impulsive and highly upbeat climax of having to rescue the fallen comrade as the colony station begins to crumble away beneath their feet.Watch for Lance Hendricksen and Bill Paxton, who are the two people who have been killed off by an Alien, the Terminator and the Predator."
jolivarez-37256,"Nov 10, 2022",9/10,I'm gonna say Godfather two and this. I don't want to knock alien because I think it is a masterpiece but this thing has slightly surpassed it.Maybe a better way to say it is the alien is that slow burn suspense where you are trying to figure everything out. There's not really much mystery going on in aliens but it is still masterfully done in a way that keeps you on the edge of your seat. We of course know what the monster is already in this movie but we love it.I just read a whole thing about how David Fincher got screwed over on the third alien movie and I feel bad for him having to try to live up to the first two movies. I just don't see how you could ever match this. Cameron's a genius.
tonycairney,"Jan 26, 2024",10/10,"Sound ,visuals, cinematography, acting ,direction, lighting, costume, props, everything about this incredible movie is perfection on my first view I was glued to the screen caught off guard by the jump scares , fascinated with the army jargon the guns the science fiction with repeated watches I thought maybe that feeling of awe would lessen maybe it was just nostalgia that made me enjoy it on repeated viewings but no it stands up to the test of time the parctical effects make it so immersive visceral the lighting and set dressing make for science fiction with a sense of realism everything has a lived in feel ,when people say they don't make them like they used to this is what they mean !"
xXMetalrockeRXx,"Apr 27, 2017",8/10,"In this film, James Cameron not only did justice to the original, but added so much to this world that it changes (for the better) the way we view the first one. Even though this film isn't the same genre as its predecessor, it made the smart choice of attempting to be a fast paced action film and, wow, did it work. Great cinematography , pristine direction and action packed, suspenseful storytelling mix in to make a absorbing and visually striking movie. Weaver's performance was outstanding and Cameron's vision, spot on. Except for some green screen that doesn't hold up as well, this film is near flawless. 8.5/10 for me in the enjoyment factor, but being objective in its quality: 10/10"
Berry55,"Aug 21, 2025",7/10,I loved the first one so I watched this with high expectations but It did not delivered like the first one.Don't get me wrong tho this is a good movie but not as good as the first one.This movie drags in the second act. If the runtime was little less it would have been good.The first and third act are good but the second one has bad pacing.I hope next alien film has good pacing.
jordymadueno,"Jun 2, 2025",7/10,"James Cameron's *Aliens*, the sequel to Ridley Scott's 1979 *Alien*, expands the universe in both scale and ambition. Set decades after the events of the original, this installment trades the slow-burn horror of the first film for a high-octane action-thriller tone-without completely abandoning the psychological unease that made the original iconic.Technically speaking, the film is a product of its time-both in impressive and occasionally jarring ways. While the special effects and miniature models show remarkable craftsmanship for the mid-1980s, some of the space compositions now feel dated, particularly when different visual layers fail to convincingly blend into a single frame. Yet in many instances, especially within the spacecraft interiors and alien-infested corridors, the immersion remains strong. The art direction shines with detailed sets, practical effects, and weapons that feel both futuristic and gritty. The powered exosuit, for example, remains an iconic piece of sci-fi machinery, even if the illusion briefly falters.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, this time with a broader emotional arc. Initially skeptical and weary, her reluctant heroism evolves as she forms a protective bond with a young girl named Newt (Carrie Henn), providing the film with its emotional core. Though some character motivations can feel sudden or underdeveloped, Ripley's maternal connection to Newt injects depth into a cast that is otherwise composed of stereotypical military tough guys.That said, performances are a mixed bag. Some characters fall into melodramatic or theatrical territory, diminishing the realism. A few supporting actors stand out, but many fall victim to flat dialogue and rushed development. Still, there are moments-particularly in the second half-where the emotional stakes rise and the tension becomes palpably gripping.Thematically, *Aliens* retains some of the corporate cynicism from the first film, highlighting human greed and manipulation, especially through characters like Burke (Paul Reiser). However, the film's strength lies more in its pacing during the final hour, where suspense, action, and character urgency finally align. It's in this stretch that *Aliens* finds its stride, delivering memorable sequences that justify its reputation.While the plot sometimes relies on convenient or questionable logic, especially regarding the colony's survival and the underexplained technological limitations, the payoff in tension and action compensates for early narrative weaknesses. And though it mirrors the structure of its predecessor a bit too closely in parts, it does so with enough visual flair and thematic continuity to feel like a natural evolution rather than a mere retread.In conclusion, *Aliens* is an ambitious sequel that, while imperfect, manages to build upon the legacy of the original. It offers enough thrills, practical effects, and emotional stakes to keep viewers invested-especially those willing to forgive some uneven acting and plot contrivances. If anything, it sets a compelling foundation for future entries in the franchise."
esa_65,"Oct 16, 2015",3/10,"All the suspense of Alien is lost. The almost invincible intelligent predator has been diminished to a mindless beast, slaughtered in masses by Ripley, a corporate jerk and a bunch of military dimwits. The only character with any depth is the little girl Newt, who's lines are the only thing remembered from this movie, and the little first time actress Carrie Henn does a wonderful job with the role. The android character Bishop is also somewhat sympathetic, redeeming the reputation after John Hurt's memorable Kane in Alien. Even if you have seen Alien many times, it is better to watch it again than ruin the whole idea by watching this."
philmaddran,"Nov 3, 2022",10/10,"Anyone ever rates this lower than a ten and they know nothing about films. This is movie making at its best. A rare classic where, in my eyes out does the original. Classic lines that will be forever remembered. Some of the strongest female leads ever. Original version is awesome, and the directors cut just adds to the amazing story. The fact that this film was in the 80s and still test the time and is far better than 99% of the cgi films done today (and I'm all for marvel films before you judge me) says so much. Will always be in my top 5 films. Sigourney Weaver is just a bad ass and will forever be the ruler of aliens."
MickeyTheConstant,"Dec 5, 2021",10/10,"This movie has it all. Great action, suspense, horror. A really stunning sequel. Have watched it repeated times and never dates. Still absolutely smashes it every time. So many movies have tried to copy it over the years but none even come close. Immense cinema."
EdwardtheBlackPrince,"Oct 2, 2023",9/10,"When Alien first hit the Screen, it helped usher in an era of Sci-fi in its visual world-building and atmospheric appeal with round characters that were found but still had an element to it that was more than campy costumes and shooting lasers. Both Ridley Scott's and H. R. Giger's minds, combine to create this very other world feel to it. When James Cameron was brought on board to direct Aliens with the effort of past designers of the original, he managed to Honor the Substance and ominous tone of the Original while also expanding on the world. Alien was very much a Horror film in Space. A monster picking off Victims by one had a very ominous feel to it Whether there was noise, or it was complete silence. There was this feeling of isolation and low-level tension. This very much shows in the first half of the film When they are at the colony you still have the barren feel. You have these untrained everyday people against a single monster. How do you up that with a prepared Group? Enter the Colonial Marines one of the most Iconic Groups in Sci-fi History. Whether it's Bill Paxton as Hutson or Hicks or Vasquez. The chemistry between all of them is proud, Confident, Arrogant. The amount of charm and hubris Each of these characters delivers leaves a long-standing impact. Like most military, they believe they have complete control. And when you enter the base and see the hive it draws you in and then drops into the Action that this film delivers on a much larger heart pounding., but the movie still delivers on that human element one of the most important cores of the film is Ripley. Sigourney Weaver already made an impact with the original. The sequel cemented Her and the character of Ripley as Action Icon. She's just very rounded. She didn't just return to be there. The ordeal of She has been drifting in Space for 57 years and had a daughter who died and never married or had kids. The hearing You set her up as she lost having to find a purpose. When she meets Newt, she almost finds herself again being this guardian and mother to this little girl who lost everything herself. You feel a bond between them it's the drive of the movie not only to survival."
M-42,"Feb 25, 1999",10/10,"A great movie that proves that you can have a second movie in a series that is as good as the first.  Sigourney Weaver does a great job on the character Ripley.  Michael Biehn also does a great job at playing the smart Corporal Hicks.  James Cameron also did a great job on writing the script.  In all, the movie is a great one with good characters and has a lot of suspense."
nparnold,"Jan 3, 2022",10/10,"The greatest sequel in film history. Everything music, photography, acting is just top notch. Having just watched it again after a long break from it, it stands up to the test of time."
MOVIELOVER_1234,"Jan 19, 2024",N/A,"James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is a rare sequel that not only matches but in many ways surpasses its predecessor. The 1986 film took the suspenseful, atmospheric horror of Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" and transformed it into a high-octane, sci-fi action thriller without losing the essence of what made the original so compelling.""Aliens"" returns Sigourney Weaver as Ellen Ripley, the sole survivor of the Nostromo, now waking from hyper-sleep to a world that has moved on without her. When contact is lost with a colony on the same planet where the Nostromo encountered the alien, Ripley, still haunted by her previous experience, reluctantly agrees to join a marine expedition as an advisor. This setup shifts the tone from the claustrophobic, singular horror of ""Alien"" to a grander scale, combining elements of military action, horror, and science fiction in a seamless blend.Cameron's direction is meticulous and intense. He expands the alien universe with broader lore and deeper themes, including corporate greed and the maternal instincts of both Ripley and the alien queen, leading to a climactic showdown. The action sequences are groundbreaking, including the iconic Power Loader suit battle, which remains one of the most memorable moments in sci-fi cinema.Weaver's performance is the backbone of the film. Her portrayal of Ripley as a tough, resourceful, yet deeply human character set a new standard for female action heroes. The supporting cast, notably Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton, add depth and humanity to the marines, avoiding one-dimensional characterizations.The visual effects and creature design in ""Aliens"" are exemplary. The use of practical effects for the aliens and the environments they inhabit creates a tangible, immersive world. The film's pacing is another feat; Cameron expertly builds tension and fear, interspersing quieter, character-driven moments with intense action sequences.The thematic depth of ""Aliens"" is noteworthy. It explores the idea of facing one's fears, corporate exploitation, and the concept of motherhood in a way that is rare for action movies. This thematic richness, combined with masterful direction, strong performances, and innovative effects, makes ""Aliens"" a landmark film.In summary, ""Aliens"" is more than just a sequel; it's a reimagining that expands and enriches its source material. It's a film that successfully blends multiple genres to create a thrilling, emotionally resonant, and visually spectacular cinematic experience. It's not just a great sci-fi action film; it's one of the greatest films of the 20th century."
frankde-jong,"Jun 13, 2020",7/10,"""Aliens"" is the sequel of ""Alien"" (1979, Ridley Scott). It is only slightly worse than the first film (which is an achievement in itself) and a balanced mix of continuity and changes.In the first place ""Aliens"" is much more action oriented than his predecessor, especialy in the second half. The title of the film already indicates that this time there are multiple monsters. Also telling are the subtitles on the posters. The subtitle of ""Alien"" is: ""In space no one can hear you scream"" (loneliness). The subtitle of ""Aliens"" is: ""This time it's war"" (action). The action comes from the aliens of course but also from the heavy armed marines that form the crew of the spaceship. This marines are so heavy armed that they start to look like some form of Cyborgs. The sheer weight of their equipment causes them to move in a very peculiar way that ads to the tension of the movie.The second diffence is the theme of the movie. In ""Alien"" the best known scenes are related to the way the alien reproduces itself. So the theme of this movie can be labeled as ""birth"". In ""Aliens"" main character Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) takes care of an orphaned girl. In the final fight her opponent is the queen of the aliens population. So the theme of ""Aliens"" can be labeled as ""motherhood"".There is also continuity between the films. In both cases the crew of the spaceship consists of blue collar workers (which is unusual in science fiction films). In both films there are clues that the company behind the spaceship is willing to sacrifice the crew if necessary. In both films the first expedition outside the spaceship is to an abandoned place (a foreign spaceship (""Alien"") and a colony for earthlings (""Aliens"") respectively). These scenes have much in common. The tension is in anticipation of the monsters, that we do not see yet. After this scene ""Aliens"" becomes more action ariented and the films start to diverge in character."
isaiahwilson15,"Mar 6, 2015",10/10,"Aliens has literally everything I look for in an action movie. The cast is the base of this movie's greatness, as each supporting character has a very equal level of importance. You know its not a James Cameron film without the inclusion of a powerful female character, and Ripley serves as the archetype for the perfect female lead character. Ellen Ripley's roles as an astronaut, soldier, and mother help make her the perfect choice to lead this group of soldiers in the fight against the Alien. The Aliens in this movie are back and man are they scary. James Cameron's close attention to the special effects once again helps elevate all aspects of his movie. Everything from the Aliens to the movie sets add to the thrill and suspense of this movie. Finally on top of all of that, you have Hudson. Hudson well, you'll just have to watch the movie to see why Bill Paxton's Hudson is the best part of Aliens. Overall, if you are looking for a movie with action, comedy, thrills, and some frightening moments, than this is the best movie you could possibly choose."
cab-consumer,"Jun 22, 2008",9/10,"Aliens is a thrilling film. Throughout the plot is on a thrill ride which never seems overly contrived. And, in contrast to a lot of films I have seen, you actually come to care about the characters here. The motherly relationship between Ripley and Newt is particularly resonant; a tender eye of the storm of this monster yarn. You will come to love the marines too. Bill Paxton is great as Hudson, Michael Biehn as Hicks. You will boo at the sliminess of Burke and the wimpyness of Gorman.Signourney Weaver has a wonderful quality about her as Ripley. A stark beauty and a quiet assurance. Lance Henrikson as Bishop also plays a good character.This is a well written, expertly executed, brilliantly realised sci-fi yarn that will have you chewing your finger tips off with suspense. Top class entertainment, and it has a bit of heart too. And over 20 years old too."
deepfrieddodo,"Oct 24, 2022",10/10,"Whilst Ridley Scott's 'Alien' felt firmly within the horror genre, James Cameron's sequel switches from a single ominous menace to an onslaught in the action-packed 'Aliens'. Both films are perfect in their own right.A fantastic continuation of the plot from it's predecessor, 'Ripley' develops as a character from a (badass) survivor to a (badass) leader. The whole roster of other characters add to the military theme, and although a couple can be a little clunky at first, and more stereotypical than the first film would allow, they each grow into their own, providing their own memorable scenes and quips. 'Bishop' especially flourishes as an individual character due to the plot of the previous film.Weaver is simply excellent, showing her range from power to vulnerability, and her iconic character would not be the same without her performance. She is supported again by fantastic set work, costuming and puppetry, which are all unbelievably realistic.Horror is not at the forefront of Aliens, but tension still fills the film. A little longer to get into action, the foundations built on at the beginning of the film really contribute to the underlying arcs in the story, particularly for the likes of Burke.Thoroughly enjoyable, pulse-raising action to continue a great franchise build around an excellent lead character and her titular foes."
eternalsea,"Apr 4, 2006",10/10,"Sequels rarely stand up to the original. Jaws, Jurassic Park and Predator are all big Hollywood franchises that started at a very high standard but as time continued they simply grew worse and worse. However there are those sequels that many believe to be better than their predecessors. The Godfather part 2 and The Empire strikes back are a few of the names but in my opinion the best of this rare breed is the 2nd in the Alien saga. Aliens. The story starts with Ripley being found in space, shes has been floating their for 56 years but due to hyper sleep hasn't aged a day. The company Weyland Yutani picks here up and brings here back to a space station, where She tells them of her encounter of the Alien, which is met with ridicule and disbelief. However the company looses contact with the farmers that mine on the alien planet and together with a group of marines Ripley returns to face her demons. The acting is the best the series ever offered with Sigourney Weaver picking up an Oscar nomination and rightly so. Michael Biehn and Lance Hennrikson are very impressive, giving great depth to their characters. Carrie Henn is a great new comer, but for some odd reason has never worked again. The thrills are in high supply here as are the often grisly scares. The Aliens look even meaner here than they did in the original and the Queen when she appears is possibly the most frightening creature ever to grace are screens. Another great point Aliens offers is the fact you care for its characters, Even the asshole marine types. This means that when ever peril is near we feel even more anxious, simply because we have grown attached to those for whom the danger looms. Few movies these days have that quality, indeed the only action orientated film of the last 15 years that had this factor is the original Jurassic Park. So to conclude Aliens is really worth seeing. Its well acted, well written and highly entertaining. You would be a fool to give this one a miss."
G'aal,"Oct 29, 1998",10/10,"""Aliens"" is, without question, the greatest science fiction action/adventure movie of all time.  This is a spellbinding, jaw-dropping epic of a movie masterpiece that pulls off the rarest of feats -- it actually tops its predecessor, the inimitable ""Alien"", even going so far as to make it look the slightest bit campy and predictable by comparison (though it still remains a groundbreaking, chilling, landmark science fiction/horror classic).""Aliens"" interweaves competing themes and juxtaposes action, character development, suspense, cameraderie, fear and heroism brilliantly.  The movie is far more multi-faceted than the original, which surpassed it on the horror and suspense fronts only.  ""Aliens"" adds doses of realism to make the entire viewing experience seem more ""human"" -- the Hudson whining at times seems ad-libbed, the dialogue is unmatched in a movie of its genre and the heroism is, remarkably,  under-glorified.  The characters make mistakes throughout the movie, a deft touch by Cameron and counter to the typical Hollywood action hero ""kick ass"" mentality.Every single character in ""Aliens"" is likeable at one time or another, even the villain Burke.  Think of all the great ensemble casts you've seen in the past, whether they be on television (""The Mary Tyler Moore Show"", ""Cheers"") or on the silver screen (""Fried Green Tomatoes"", ""The Shawshank Redemption"", etc.).  Psychologically, this is an important method to convey and establish a connection between the viewer and the movie.  Conversely, movies that fail to develop that connection sufficiently tend to suffer as a result. ""Aliens"" far and away does the best job of this in the entire series, well ahead of the original and light-years ahead of the successors.Speaking of which, the third installment was flawed, choppy and illogically constructed but nonetheless a worthy effort and the fourth a debacle in both form and function.  My suggestion is that the viewer pop in the original, view and enjoy its atmosphere and cat-and-mouse terror, then immediately view the roiling, adrenaline-inducing, light-speed second installment.  You will walk away from that session marvelling at how this franchise was born and raised.  See the third one at a later date and consider the fourth one a wayward child and move on."
groovyuniverse,"Nov 21, 2011",7/10,"(I'm Dutch and do not speak/write English perfectly, beware!)Here and now, in 2011, I decided to watch both Alien movies. It was about time since I am 27 now and I love science fiction, but I never took the chance to watch these two movies. I'm not going to review them both of course, but Aliens is such a different movie than Alien is that I have to include my experience with the first movie.To summarize my night with the first movie: I LOVED it. Some viewers criticize Alien for having a slow pace but i think it is an essential feature of this movie being so effective. There are few scares, but the ones i got truly SCARED and HORRIFIED me. I also love the atmosphere, strengthened by the beautiful music and convincing effects, still holding up after 30 years. There is a loneliness in it all that just sucked me in, sitting alone myself in my room with the lights turned off.A few days later i started to watch 'Aliens', not knowing what to expect, besides a continuation of the story. Soon i discovered that Aliens is a truly different movie, and the difference in style didn't appeal to me first. Sure, Ripleys' situation is fascinating and the money-hungry CEO's made my empathize with Ripley even more but I really missed the buildup the first movie had. There, I felt isolated like the small crew in the ship, slowly being drawn to the alien horror. In Aliens, this feeling of isolation is largely absent as Ripley starts her second encounter being in contact with groups of people, being at safe distance from the threat.After an initial scare, the first half of the movie has a pretty slow pace compared to how the movie speeds up eventually. When the movie starts to pick up pace I loved most of the action scenes and after some early annoyance with Newt, I started to love the bond she developed with Ripley and I really wanted them to survive! So for me, the second half of the movie made up for the first half which I felt to be quite dull.But still, I feel the urge to write about what i consider Aliens' shortcomings because I had higher expectations of this movie. Maybe some of my points of critique arise because i am born in the eighties and raised with bombastic movies like Terminator (2), Robocop, Independence Day, and Starship Troopers. I guess I would have like this movie better if i would have seen it earlier, maybe then i wouldn't have felt the action movie deja vu feeling Aliens gave me.Deja vu, like the group of Marines. I've seen too many cool Marines on the big screen in my life. Sympathy for them did develop throughout the movie, but their 'badass' attitude made them far less human for me than the crew of the first movie. Talking about 'less human', I hated Burke from the start, it was just too obvious he was a lying weasel. I enjoyed him being killed, too bad the killing scene was too short in comparison with the disgust i felt for him!After 25 years, Despite my complaints, this is a pretty good movie with a fantastic finale. In retrospect it suffers from the existence of too many roller-coaster ride action movies which came out after 1986. And in this argument lies my appreciation of the first movie, it lacks explosions and bombast but that simplicity feels like a fresh breath of air in a landscape of action/horror movies trying to be bigger than the one before."
jomayevans,"Dec 23, 2022",10/10,"It may not be my favourite movie ever, not sure but as a unbiased opinion ALIENS is without a doubt the Greatest movie of all time even to this day.. it combines all genres into 1. Sarcastic comedy, sci-fi , horror, action and drama the set pieces costumes scenery are top notch and effects still better than anything to this day . And the acting is phenomenal. The creatures themselves are terrifying and you can always feel the umcomprehensible dread of ever having to face such a creature. The creatures themselves are pure genius. There has never been anything as scary. Ripley and vasquez are without a doubt the toughest heroines ever to grace the screen. Plus plenty of eye candy with Michael biehn amd Paxton great as always. Every actor plays the role perfectly. An epic ride that will mever ever be beat cinematic wise. It would be impossible to top a movie that is a 10 in every category it covers. People say they like the first best which I don't get as in my opinion its not even close to its far superior sequel."

MikaelPal,"Oct 8, 2003",3/10,"I must say that this was the last in the series of the four alien movies I saw. First I saw Alien 3, then the original Alien, I catched Alien: Resurrection in the theaters and finally I got my chance to see this one. I was pretty excited to finally see the film that everybody told nothing but good, but after the film... Well, I felt a bit betrayed.The original Alien was more like a Lovecraftian mystery than an action film. The creature that was hardly seen and when it was seen it looked like something diffrent than your normal man in a rubber suit (ala Predator), like something that could just stand next to the ships walls and dissapear to the dark painting of gaslines. This was something that Cameron refused to understand. Propably thinking of Starship Troopers without having to pay the rights for the book, Cameron wrote the story of Aliens. Ripley, after escaping the alien in the first film, is revived after drifting in space for a long long time and is given a change to make his revenge with a group of space marines at her side. First problem with the film is the script. It's very traditional following everything taught by the ""now you can write a script too""-books. No true surprises, everybody is motivated and follows their lines with boring results. A special thanks to Gormans actor for his campy performance during the first attack. Just the fact that Siquorney was nominated for an oscar for this role makes you wonder by what standards do they choose in the Academy. The dark gothic look of the Alien is gone, replaced by Camerons ""blue""-look than can be found in his every movie. The Alien has been redesigned to look more like a skeleton than the shiny tubular biomechanoid of the first one. It's a good thing they returned to the original design in Alien3. The action is your usual Cameron. Slow, with huge fireballs.Finally the idea about the Queen just destroyed the mystery surrounding the alien creature. In Alien the creature showed some strange signs by toying with its prey and propably raping Lambert. In this one, the creatures are just mindless drones thats main purpose is to kill. Thus Cameron manages to take away the horror of the original Alien. Even the facehugger gets a facelift to look a little bit less menacing. And the overhyped queen? Looking at the queen and comparing it with the dinosaurs of Jurassic Park 3 makes you just wonder if Stan Winstons studio can ever get that stutter out of their animatronics, since Jim Henson studios have been without it for years. The good things about this campy action movie? Well, there are some pretty good effect shots, like the ones of the dropship and the final battle. But in the end this film will be admired by people without the patience to look at something like Alien or The Thing. But in my mind it will always be like Commando: Funny as hell at the points it's supposed to be dead serious."
cheersfan213,"Jan 9, 2010",10/10,"Great action, great story, but most of all, just a fantastic cast that really knows how to humanize a story. Very much in line with the original, and James Cameron makes sure that he doesn't completely ignore the events of the first film which is so often what sequels with different directors do. There seems to be a lot more action in this one than in the original, which was basically a horror film with some action elements. The characters combat the aliens and in some cases are killed by the aliens in very memorable, distinct ways. The script is sharp as a knife and can bring a tear to your eye at any moment, but also is very funny and keen. Jim Cameron is a great storyteller/director, and when he does both write and direct a movie, you know you're in for a real treat. Aliens gets a perfect 10/10."
evanston_dad,"Mar 31, 2008",8/10,"Say what you will about James Cameron's attempts at more ""serious"" film-making (""Titanic""? Ha!), the man does know how to put together an action movie. He takes a completely different approach to this second film in the ""Alien"" series than Ridley Scott did to the first -- whereas Scott's film was slow, creepy and scarier for what you didn't see than for what you did, Cameron's is nearly non-stop hard-core action. It works though, and for all the difference in their styles, the two films cohere very well together.In this sequel, the focus moves away from the science/research angle of the first and instead focuses on a group of marines sent to a ghost town of a space station to investigate the disappearance of the colonists. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is along for the ride again, and Cameron uses her fear of what they could potentially be walking into effectively. Whereas in the first one, we were scared because we shared the scientists' cluelessness about what was going on and only learned things as they learned them, in this one we're scared in the same way Ripley is, precisely because we know what's going on and how terrifying it is. And Cameron ups the ante here -- instead of one single alien as a nemesis, this group of marines has to deal with hundreds of them.I'm not really a fan of the subplot involving Newt, the little girl the marines find and who forms an attachment to Ripley. But the story does give Ripley's character a lot of motivation and makes her stand off with the aliens much more personal.I've seen this film a few times, so you'd think it wouldn't hold any suspense for me now, but I just watched it again over the weekend and damned if I wasn't on the edge of my seat.Grade: A"
averjee,"May 21, 1999",10/10,"The sequel to Ridley Scott's successful ALIEN (1979) is a nonstop, high-tech, souped-up war movie - it does for action sci-fi thrillers what the original did for horror-flicks: namely, reinvent and soup up the genre.This is James Cameron at his very best: wonderfully suspenseful action sequences with our spunky, likable heroes (led by a female - A Cameron staple) taking on a villain that is literally out of this world.Cameron's villains have included relentless terminators and unstoppable icebergs, but the aliens he creates are something else. Killing machines par excellence, vicious and unremorseful.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley in an oscar-nominated performance; Ripley is perhaps the most convincing, exciting action heroine anywhere in filmdom.The rest of the good guys are a squad of hardbitten, foul-mouthed marines, tough and resourceful but fraught with human frailties in a crisis just like any of us. And that's where the fun begins."
rh86,"Nov 18, 2006",10/10,"If Alien is the best sci fi horror ever made then Aliens is most definitely the best sci fi action ever made. James Cameron made sure that his film was a different movie from the first and succeeds greatly.57 years after the end of Alien, Sigourney Weaver's Ripley is found floating in space and bought back to earth where her story is greeted with disbelief and the planet where she met the Alien is now a colony. And this is just the fist ten minutes of the movie. Once contact is lost with the colony, the story ramps up a gear as Ripley accompanies a team of marines to the planet. Did, I say ramp up a gear, I mean goes into overdrive.The suspense on arrival at the planet does well at building up the tension and also means that we get to actually know the characters, the incompetent lieutanent, Jeanette Goldstein's bad ass Private Vasquez, Bill Paxton's comic relief Hudson and Michael Biehn's Corporal Hicks. And once the aliens attack we're treated to a non stop roller-coaster ride of a movie. There's also a good human storyline as Ripley take's charge of the only colonist remaining, eight year old Newt (Carrie Henn in her one and only role) while the marines are slowly picked off and Ripley is forced to confront her demons.Despite being 20 years old now, this film still stands out. Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance while the effects did win. Despite massive advances in CGI and effects since 1986, the effects in Aliens still stand up and actually work better. The Alien's aren't computers, they do exist even the monstrous Alien Queen, making for the mother of all show downs."
Maverick-65,"Mar 30, 1999",10/10,"Despite the fact that the movie is now a bit dated, the special effects remain stunning.  Many have claimed that ""Alien"" is best movie of it's type. Many also claim that no sequel can ever surpass the first.  Aliens is better than Alien, because it does not drag out the suspense of waiting to see aliens quite as long as the first movie did.  As for action, it can't be beat!  Lots of creatures and lots of firepower give a gung-ho movie fan what he/she wants.  The acting is convincing, the technology is amazing, and the explosion of the reactor on LV-426 is simply out-of-this-world!  The only detractor from this movie is ""Alien3"", which takes most of ""Aliens'"" great characters and flushes them right down the toilet.  Anyway, ""Aliens"" is a great movie in it's own right and deserves credit for that.  Thank you.(P.S.)  Petition 20th Century Fox to release ""Aliens: Special Edition"" to VHS where it rightly belongs."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 5, 2018",7/10,"Switching the focus from suspense to action wisely reduces the risk of direct comparison, making this sequel one of the few that presents a solid case for perhaps besting the original. For me, 'Aliens (1986)' is slightly weaker than its predecessor but is still a fun experience with some engaging set-pieces (especially a tension-filled face-off with a face-hugger) and a fantastic finale. It is at its best when it brings in the suspense elements that the series so desperately needs, but it always keeps a keen focus on the horrific nature of its eponymous creatures even though their impact is severely diluted this time around. It successfully follows up one of the best horror films of all time and doesn't just rehash it, which is to be admired, but also manages to stand alone as a great film. 7/10"
Scott_Mercer741,"Jan 31, 2022",10/10,"A white knuckle ride from start to finish. Often given as the example of when sequels out-do the original (although that can be argued).Aliens' 2 1/2 run time never outstays its welcome as James Cameron smashes from one set piece to the next as we follow a rag tag bunch of marines with a reluctant Elen Ripley in toe as they head back to LV-426 from the first film to find out what the hell is going on down there.This film absolutely rocks! It's script is snappy delivering endlessly quotable dialogue, the special effects still look awesome and the imagery designed by Giger still shocks and disgusts to this day. The cast features the standard Cameron recruits including an excellent Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton who arguably steals every scene he is in.Aliens is a film that took its source material and revolutionised it acting as a framework for how movie sequels should be made. Not just a re-hash but a reimagining. It is a shame many film makers don't pay attention to the lessons learnt here.For any science fiction fan this is mandatory viewing."
thechrisfigaro,"Dec 28, 2024",7/10,"While Aliens improves on the first film in some ways, it still suffers from questionable character decisions, though thankfully there are fewer outright idiotic ones this time. The stakes feel higher, and the action is more engaging, making it easier to enjoy.One standout is the robot, Bishop, who is not only competent but also a genuinely likeable and reliable character. His calm and logical presence contrasts sharply with the chaos surrounding him, and he's a refreshing addition to the story.That said, some of the character choices still defy common sense. For example, when a man finds the alien ship, he doesn't even consider taking his family to safety before exploring it-an absolutely baffling decision. These kinds of moments remind you that while the film is entertaining, it's far from a masterpiece.Overall, it's an improvement over the first film, and I can say I actually liked it, but it still falls short of greatness."
siit,"Jan 21, 2006",9/10,"Aliens highlights and perfectly illustrates the arrogance of man's (and especially the American) attitude and supposition of superiority over all things. It also highlights the despicable lengths that corporations will stoop too to generate money. Maybe thats a cynical view but none the less it is true.The movie itself is fabulous. Gone is the rackety bucket of the Nostromo and in its place is the next evolutionary step what is expected 50 plus years later. However the technology is not overbearing and is entirely plausible for soldiers. The ships look fantastic, the weapons are awesome and I am still waiting for the 'Loader' as a Christmas present.The cast is excellent. Ever since Terminator, I have been a massive Michael Biehn fan and he didn't fail to deliver. Bill Paxton's Hudson is an instant classic and he is responsible for some of the most truly memorable lines in the movie. The human villain in Aliens plays his role so well, I was actually guilty of not liking the actor for years because I couldn't overcome his absolute credible portrayal of a man consumed with loyalty to his corporations avarice.Of all the Alien franchise movies, Sigourney Weaver puts in her best performance. You feel her xenophobia and believe the outright terror she feels. The solo preparation of her ride down the elevator is some of the best acting I have ever witnessed. The interaction between characters is surprisingly in-depth and varied to say Aliens is primarily a sci-fi action movie; true camaraderie, distrust, blossom of love, deep respect, intense dislike and more are examined in and unfolded in a totally believable and well executed manner. I also loved the mix of male and female in equal risk taking/responsibility roles and I love the fact the 'true' equality is not rammed down the audience's throat.We get to see more of the 'alien' in this outing but realistically it's more quick edited shots. However the mother of all aliens makes her appearance and she is phenomenal. If you haven't seen Aliens, the first time you see her, you will be awestruck.The major difference between Alien and Aliens is the way the horror and thrill is extracted from the audience. Alien is very claustrophobic in its suspense and setting and is so successful. Aliens on the other hand has some elements of that claustrophobia, however the pace is higher and the audience is swept along with multiple jumps, startles, and action scenes all to a brilliant and most befitting musical score.Aliens is a must see cult classic, and like all the movies in the Alien saga, the Director's cut is the version that is essential to view. A large majority of Alien saga fans rate this movie the best, it is certainly close."
swan-swan,"Nov 7, 2005",10/10,"It's not one alien this time. It's called ""Aliens"" for a reason.A quick, short comment on this; this one kept me hooked until the very end. I stayed up until six in the morning watching this in a darkened lounge...terrifying, gripping, and incredible. That goes for the Aliens as well...My main opinion on this movie is this. I wish that I could give it an eleven or twelve out of ten, because I gave Alien full marks, and this one was much better. Sigourney is brilliant, the plot is original and intense, and no matter what, you jump.12/10."
bsideleau-62176,"Mar 28, 2021",10/10,"Aliens is one of those films that is perfect on virtually every level and also stands the test of time. The practical xenomorph effects (particularly the final fight with the queen) look better than any released today. Thanks to the flawless direction by Cameron, the action sequences are seamless. The characters and acting are also all top notch. One thing sorely missing from modern day action/monster movies are compelling human characters. Like in Jaws, the human characters in Aliens are even more memorable than the beasts themselves. Ripley, Hicks, Hudson, etc. We will remember these names and their lines for the rest of our lives. Aliens is an action benchmark that has yet to be equaled."
JPupReb,"Jul 22, 2015",10/10,"It's hard to sum up how much I love the entire 2hr 17mins of pure awesomeness that comprise this film. Did you know that you can wear out a DVD? I have done so with Aliens - twice. I even played, and enjoyed, the terrible Colonial Marines video game.Some people argue whether this or the original Alien is the better movie, but for me there's really no contest. And the less said about the later sequels, the better.I imagine you've already seen Aliens and are just reading this review to see how great other people also think it is, but if not, or if you haven't seen it for a while, then I recommend watching it again soon. It's amazing how good it still is, getting close to being 30yrs old.I had the good fortune to watch it on the big screen last year as part of a Halloween double bill at my local cinema. It was heaven.If you're watching it at home, I highly recommend the Blu-Ray version to get the full grainy goodness of the original picture.10/10 perfection!"
jonathanmark-77048,"May 7, 2015",10/10,"Plot: After floating in space for 57 years, Lt. Ripley's (Sigourney Weaver) shuttle is found by a deep space salvage team. Upon arriving at LV-426, the marines find only one survivor, a nine year old girl named Newt (Carrie Henn). But even these battle-hardened marines with all the latest weaponry are no match for the hundreds of aliens that have invaded the colony.I have loved this movie ever since I saw it as a kid years ago. This was a Perfect sequel to Alien. One of the things I love about it is that it doesn't try to copy the original, it becomes it's own movie in a way. Sigourney Weaver is fantastic as Ripley who becomes a stronger character than she was in the first film and earns that in the end. Every actor does an outstanding job fully realizing their characters whether it's Michael Biehn (in my opinion) his absolute best performance as Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bill Paxton as Hudson, Jeanette Goldstein as Vazquez, William Hope as Lt. Gorman, Lance Henriksen as Bishop, Carrie Benn as Newt and many others. Each character is more memorable each time I watch it.I personally found no flaws in this film. It is well paced with great action, great dialogue, a well-rounded story with a satisfying conclusion and a terrific score by James Horner. This is my favorite movie of all time and nothing will change that."
spencergrande6,"Jul 27, 2017",10/10,"This film just works, like the first one does, it's as simple as that. Cameron found a way to preserve the spirit of the original while taking it in a new direction and expanding on its characters and universe in what feels like an effortless and wholly inevitable follow up to the original classic - he knew the same old shtick just wouldn't cut it this time around.So instead the film jumps genre - a lot of people regard this as an action movie though I think they're off by one. This is an action- thriller, or an action-suspense movie. The scenes of gun shooting and alien running and jumping is played first as suspense, and then as thriller, wrapped in an ostensible action package. It's more like trying to fight back against the invincible boogeyman than it is just mowing down hordes of faceless baddies.The special effects by Stan Winston are out of this world. Maybe the best mechanical and miniatures of the entire series (it's ironic that the parts that aged the worst are the old CGI). The Queen and her egg laying is just as gnarly as ever. The Alien slowly rising out of the water behind Newt is an all-time iconic shot.Sigourney Weaver is never better than in this film. She's given just a bit more characterization this time around, involving the subtext of mothers and daughters, but it never overtakes the story and most of its emotion is brought through in her performance. There's a shot of her smoking a cigarette near the beginning, with a long untapped piece of ash hanging from it, that says everything just from the way she holds herself. She has to go back and fight, there's nothing left for her in the ""real"" world. She takes what she learned in the original and here becomes an ultimate badass heroine for the ages.This is a prototypical Cameron movie. I'm not sure how he does it but he takes seemingly simple plots and characterizations and makes them fresh, exciting, thrilling, and acceptable to the audience, while honoring the pacing and rhythms without flourishes or indulgence and still manages runtimes in excess of 2 hours. The 2 1/2 hour director's cut here is superior in every way, and it doesn't even feel longer."
NightmareOnElmStreetFan,"Feb 8, 2019",10/10,"Aliens (1986) is a masterpiece one of the best action sci-fi horror war films of all time hands down. I love this movie to death it is my personal number 1 best action sci-fi-horror movie that I love to death. In my opinion this is James Cameron best film ever don't get me wrong I love The Terminator, I love Terminator 2: Judgment Day to death, they are both my personal favorite James Cameron films because Cameron is a legend I appreciate him. The same time my personal favorite films of all time will always be Aliens and Rambo: First Blood Part II because James Cameron wrote the script for it. It is a bad-ass film and I wrote a war because this time is war in the planet LV-426 Platoon of US Space Marines fights against Aliens.I know a lot of people compere this film to an action and sci-fi genre but doesn't compare to horror genre. There's plenty of horror in it: the opening scene the dreams sequence in which Ripley has a nightmare and we see Ripley been cocooned from one of those Alien creatures in her stomach that was scary sequence in which her cat Jones start hissing and creeps me out every time I see it. The creepy atmosphere of the LV-426 colony, and the heart pounding face hugger on the loose scene in the medical bay that is horror sequence.I love James Horner's music score for the movie which is his best soundtrack ever, who is no longer with us anymore. R.I.P. you are missed.I love all the characters: Ripley, Newt than the marines: Corporal Dwayne Hicks, Bishop, Private Hudson, Lieutenant Gorman, Private Vasquez, Sergeant Apone, Private Drake, Private Frost, Corporal Ferro, Private Spunkmeyer, Corporal Dietrich, Private Crowe, and Private Wierzbowski I love them all in this movie and they are memorable.Sigourney Weaver returns as Ellen Ripley, who travels with a platoon of US Colonial Marines to investigate a loss of contact with the colony established on the same planet discovered by the crew of the Nostromo in the original filmI love the action, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) finds the Alien nest, saves Newt (Carrie Henn) destroys all the eggs of the Alien. Battles with the Alien Queen one-on-one she gains a new daughter, when her real daughter was dead. Ripley comes back to colony LV-426 to face her fear once and for all so that she want have any nightmares and she and Newt will be safe. We have Bishop here a synesthetic android, he saves Ripley and Newt. Lance Henriksen is excellent as Bishop I love him in Hard Target (1993) and I love him in here to death.I love Michael Biehn as Corporal Dwayne Hicks this is my favorite role of the actor he played. I love Private Hudson (Bill Paxton) he was the best, rest in peace I really miss you. Ellen Ripley is a bad-ass warrior Sigourney Weaver was the best in this movie. Carrie Henn as Newt was the heart in this film.I love this film to death, I am cherishing with all my heart. I have this movie on Blu-ray disc and I am constantly watching it. I used to had the DVD version but I trade it for Blu-ray because of the better picture quality, better special features and the DVD cut scenes from the film away even the special edition did that. DVD did not had any special features at all. 10/10 my personal action, sci-fi, horror masterpiece war movie of all time I love ""Aliens"" to death!"
itamarscomix,"Sep 23, 2011",5/10,"Aliens is, by all accounts, a very solid and effective sci-fi epic. James Cameron shifted the horror/sci-fi blend of the 1979 original towards a more action/adventure oriented film, and as such, it works: The action scenes are good all around. But as a follow-up to one of the finest sci-fi films ever made, it fell short for me, and the constant referring to it as the best film in the series is, in my opinion, heavily unjustified. Even if taken at face-value as an action movie, it doesn't have a lot of substance on top of the action, and unlike Cameron's Terminator films it's often lacking in structure, pacing and especially in self-awareness of any kind - Aliens is dead and dull serious all the time.And when compared to the first movie, a champion of tension and atmosphere, Aliens is almost constantly predictable, and failed to get me into any state of real suspense. Also, while Alien was filled to the brim by a cast of first rate character actors - John Hurt, Harry Dean Stanton, Ian Holm, Tom Skerritt - which made every death a shocking moment, the cast of Aliens, except for Sigourney Weaver's admittedly excellent performance (though I preferred her scared survivor in Alien over her kick-ass action girl in Aliens), is pretty dull. Lance Henriksen is good in his few brief scenes as Bishop, but Michael Biehn is as unimpressive as ever, Carrie Henn doesn't get any real sympathy, and as for Paul Reiser - his cookie-cutter evil-corporate-shell character is as dull as his perfect clone, Giovanni Ribisi's character in Avatar.I may have overstated the movie's faults - it's not, by any means, a bad one, but for those reasons (mainly) I can't consider it one of my favorites, while Ridley Scott's original is. Interesting to note that many of those reasons are the same that make me dislike all other James Cameron movies, all of which are, with the exception of T2, unbelievably and ridiculously overrated."
camdendace,"Jul 30, 2023",10/10,"I just bought this movie on Blu-ray and it was one of the best movie's I saw! It was a terrifying film and one of James Cameron's best movies yet! It had an amazing cast, had intense violence and horror, and definitely triggered my claustrophobia! It's also a good movie because it doesn't have any inappropriate scene's or that bad of language. I personally thought that this sequel was even better than the original film! Unlike the first one what was about plain survival, this film was about survival AND protecting other's and using teamwork to save people and kill the aliens, The Alien trilogy is the best sci-fi horror series I have ever watched! I would highly recommend this to EVERYBODY who is not scared easily and loves sci-fi action or horror! 10/10 because I couldn't rate it 100/10!"
Moosey-2,"Jun 5, 1999",10/10,"Although I really hate the movie Titanic, I must say that James Cameron's ""Aliens"" is positively the best in the Alien's legacy. It has the best lines (amazing that James wrote this isn't it?), the best story, the best effects, and no doubt the best characters. My family and I got the Aliens DVD and it has scenes never before seen.  It has seens from the colony before the Alien's attack and even shows Newt and her family.  It also has things about Ripley's daughter and Hick's and Ripley's first names.  So if you do have a DVD and you enjoy this movie I would definitely recommend you get it on DVD."
BrodyMoazzeni,"Aug 5, 2025",10/10,"It rocks!I have watched this movie when I was a pre-teen at the cinema, and MY! It completely blew me away. It has got my adrenalin pumping so hard that I almost wanted to slip back to my seat and take a breather! Although during that time I didn't quite understand most parts of it (too young to understand), I was deeply immersed into such rich story-telling and the fantastic alien creatures. The tensely build-up atmosphere and the space-ships, grips you so tightly it seems never to let go.This movie rocks, scares you right on to your face, very mysterious, have tons of special effects (not quite CGI though, but the mechanical aliens looks just so threatening and scary). James Cameron is such a fabulous story-teller in this Sci-Fi stellar! The movie ran at more than 2 hours but I didn't feel that at all. Actually James has cut out a lot of scenes for this theatrical release back then, but you can still get those scenes back on the DVD (extra 17 minutes footage).The acting is good especially from Sigourney Weaver, Paul Reiser and Lance Henriksen (as the robot). Sigourney's Ripley is such a strong-willed woman, that even put shame to men (somehow I feel this is quite unbelievable, because she has got so much energy, especially the scene where she gets back to the Queen's hatch to save Newt). I have watched other alien series (Alien legacy - All four parts), but I can say this part 2 of the series is my favourite, followed by Alien, then Alien:Resurrection, and lastly Alien3)I am quite happy to see this film stays high at one of the top Sci-Fi movies in IMDB)Till now as an adult, I still go back to watch this DVD occasionally and every time I watch it again, it brings in a completely new scare, and new thoughts, also the new meaning of what is a horror movie all about!"

Thulemanden,"Jan 5, 2002",5/10,"To balance the reviews, I have to call this movie highly overrated.Action and lines are highly cliché-like and many features are too unrealistic even for fiction.Take the motor vehicles (tractor like bulldozer-thing) with their noisy combustion engines. Surely we can expect something better in the distant future of Aliens.Or think about a marine on combat mission entering a potentially hostile environment on a planet in her bare skin. No protection gear. Reminds me of Iraq. (ed. Jan 2005).Communication equipment connected by cable? I mean, this is sci-fi, remember? Couldn't they at least have thought of wireless? We've had radios for a hundred years. Intercomm with cables??Besides the actions lingers on with no purpose for at least 70 minutes.Calling this a great film is simply crazy. At best it's a waste of good time."
Calicodreamin,"May 16, 2022",9/10,A worthy sequel that adds scale and big guns. The storyline feels like a natural progression from the original and has some continuity. The characters are well cast and acting is decent. Effects and creature work are off the chain. An enjoyable watch.
StevenKeys,"Dec 6, 2022",9/10,"Bishop: ""Not bad, for a (monster movie)."" Sigourney Weaver, the John Wayne of cinema Space, returns for this super sequel to the box office hit, Alien (79), playing the sole survivor of the prior mission who, after awakening from a nightmare (gulp), is asked by corporate sponsors (Reiser) to return to the scene of the crime, so to speak, as an advisor to a privatized military mission sent to assess a non-responsive settlement. Michael Biehn (Hicks) co-stars as the Marine corporal who assumes command, fellow Terminator cast member, Lance Henrikson is the resident android, Bill Paxton nervy Pvt Hudson (""Game over!"") & little Carrie Henn (Newt) makes it a family, she, like her adoptive mom, a sole survivor & top strategist (""They mostly come out at night, mostly"").Additional Terminator talent would join the project in director / writer James Cameron (+ Giler Hill), producer Gale Anne Hurd and actress Jenette Goldstein (T2-JD) (Vasquez). An action-horror film never had so much love, and, like expansive sequels Bride of Frankenstein and T2-JD, surpassed its innovative original and should've been the finale, the franchise becoming more tiresome with each new one spawned. An interesting note: In the future, according to Aliens' writers, the people of Earth will no longer be saying 'awesome' every sentence. There IS hope (4/4)."

Sigourney Weaver is terrific again; I can see why these films launched her career.I will say parts of this 1986 flick are a tad repetitive from the original and a few bits are predictable, e.g. The arcs of Lance Henriksen's Bishop and Paul Reiser's Carter, but when judged overall it's another entertaining release from this franchise.I look forward to seeing if they made it a hat-trick with 'Alien³'."

Journey_with_a_Cinephile,"Nov 9, 2021",9/10,"This film is one that I saw before the original. It was in a regular rotation for me and my sister growing up. What is interesting though is that it didn't start from the beginning on the taped VHS he had. It wasn't until college that I finally saw this movie all the way through. I've since then giving it a few viewings. Most recently it was with Jaime as this appeared on our poster for the top 100 films on the Internet Movie Database. The synopsis here is fifty-seven years after surviving an apocalyptic attack aboard her space vessel by merciless space creatures, Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) awakens from hyper-sleep and tries to warn anyone who will listen about the predators.As the synopsis states, we start in the escape vessel where Ripley is still in deep sleep. A salvage ship found her and she is taken to a spaceship. It is there that she meets with Burke (Paul Reiser who relays information to her, including that her daughter has passed away. It is taking time for her to readjust as she has nightmares from her encounter.Part of what she has to do is inform a board about what happened on this planet. They don't believe her though and part of the reason is that it has been colonized since she went into her hyper-sleep. They found nothing of what she claims to have happened. She loses her license with the company. To make ends meet, she gets a job working on the docks as a loader.In the extended cut, we shift to this planet where a family travels toward a destination. They are subcontractors and check out a ship that's crashed. It is the same one from the first movie. The mother freaks out as something has attached itself to her husband's face and their daughter sees everything. She goes by the nickname of Newt (Carrie Henn).We cut back to Burke coming to visit Ripley along with Lieutenant Gorman (William Hope). They've lost contact with the colony and the company wants her to go with a unit of marines as a consultant. If she does go, they will restore her to her status. She declines at first, but Burke leaves his card. Ripley has another nightmare of aliens and decides to go.This unit is led by Lt. Gorman. Under his command are Corporal Hicks (Michael Biehn), Private Hudson (Bill Paxton), Sergeant Apone (Al Matthews) and Private Vasquez (Jenette Goldstein) to name a few. They have an android along with them by the name of Bishop (Lance Henriksen). Learning of this upsets Ripley with what happened last time. He tries to put her fears at ease, but it doesn't work. The marines are tough and ignore Ripley when she tells them about the alien race they will encounter. They think they can take out anything.The group is filled in on their mission and arrives on the planet. They find it empty. All of the colonists are missing. That is until they find Newt. She's been hiding out in the ducts and Ripley is able to get to her. They try to figure out what happened here, but she is mostly in a catatonic state. The unit expands to find that all of the colonists are kept in another location. They go there to find out what happened to them and get much more than they bargained for. Ripley thought her previous ordeal was bad, but this is much worse than she could ever imagine.That will be where I leave my recap. Something I wanted to delve into first would be that growing up, I preferred this sequel over the original. I have come to realize they are two different types of movies. Where the first one is all about suspense, the fear of being trapped while they are stalked by the alien, where this is one is more of an action film where they have to battle to stay alive. There is a lot of action in this one that is good. Jaime even prefers this one for that reason. As a more purist horror fan, I've come to love the original more.As a sequel, this movie does what I want from one. We have Ripley, our lone survivor from the original so we have that familiarity there. I like that instead of a crew that isn't trained in killing, we get a group of space marines. Seeing the xenomorphs lay waste to them makes it even scarier for me since they're more capable of handling threats. It is great to see Ripley do more of what she did previously since she is more resourceful. She also knows how dangerous they are compared to her counterparts.The last part for the story I want to delve into here is that not everyone considers this to be a horror movie. This is more of an action, adventure, sci-fi movie for sure. I would still put this into the horror movie category though, especially with how the aliens came to be and how they tear through our characters as well. It just isn't the first genre that I would put it into.That should be enough for the story, so I'll take this over to the acting then. Weaver is great once again as Ripley. She is this role and we see growth for her. The most recent view that I did was the theatrical cut. I noticed it left out a bit of her back-story which I think is a misstep. It explains why she clings to Newt like she does. Speaking of which, Henn isn't great. She's also a kid so I won't harp too much there. Biehn is solid here. He just works so well in action movies like this. Reiser I think is good as this character that we don't fully trust in the beginning since he's a company guy. Where he ends up makes a lot of sense. I like Henriksen as Bishop. Paxton does a lot of overacting here that does wear thin. The role of Hope is an interesting one. From there I'd say Matthews, Mark Rolston, Goldstein and the rest of the soldiers are good.So then the last things to go into would be the effects, cinematography and the soundtrack. For the former, I like the look of the xenomorphs here. We are expanding on what we got in the previous one which is good. The familiar ones are back and we get more of them. There is also an added bonus during the third act that is interesting. The cinematography is well done, but knowing that James Cameron was behind the camera, it makes sense. Other than that the soundtrack fits the movie for what is needed as well.In conclusion here, this movie is still solid to me. It isn't as good as the original, but I like for my sequel to build on what made the previous one good. We are getting more of the xenomorphs, a higher body count and just more interactions in general. I don't think the acting is as strong, but not by much. The effects are good along with how this is shot and the soundtrack fits for what they needed here. My stance on this one has come down the older I've gotten. I still enjoy this one quite a bit and think it is a good movie.My Rating: 8.5 out of 10."
bendypretzel,"May 3, 2025",6/10,"Review of Aliens (1986)Aliens is often hailed as one of the greatest sequels of all time, but honestly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. Yes, it's the second installment in the Alien series-following Ridley Scott's atmospheric 1979 original-and while it ramps up the action and explosions, it loses much of the eerie tension that made Alien so iconic.Directed by James Cameron, Aliens trades horror for heavy-handed action, turning what was once a chilling sci-fi thriller into a very loud, very American shoot-'em-up. It's packed with military bravado, over-the-top set pieces, and a script that leans more on one-liners than actual substance. The acting felt especially weak; characters came off as caricatures rather than believable people, and their decisions were often frustrating or laughably bad.What puzzles me most is how Aliens is so widely praised while Alien 3, which at least tries to return to the series' more introspective and grim roots, is often trashed. To me, Aliens feels bloated and shallow by comparison. If you're looking for guns and explosions in space, this might be your thing-but if you want something with nuance or atmosphere, this sequel falls short."
pabpab-ala111,"Apr 23, 2021",8/10,"The film was tense, gripping and a thrill sci-fi ride throughout. The score helps solidify this as one of my most memorable sci fi films of all time. Hats off to the special effects team as well. Definitely recommend."
skylerkennethkidd,"Oct 25, 2025",8/10,"I gotta say this movie is a classic! First time seeing it and im in love. So good! The first movie was great and better than I could have thought, but this movie blew it out of the park! Sigourney Weaver is amazing and I've loved her forever. The work they did with this movie is applausable. It has a ton of action and they kept true to the spirit of the first movie. Not often the second movie is better than the first but they really nailed it. I hated that this wasnt alien 2 at first but honestly aliens fits even better. When you have one alien vs aliens. Idk. Bold but good move I think. Just confusing when you don't understand. I can't wait to see how the third one is.Watched on app on 10-25-2025."
waynedutchin,"May 24, 2021",10/10,"After this movie they should have stopped here. Or continued in the same timeframe. Maybe Disney will give us a colonial marine show !The script and cast is perfect. I remember watching this in the theatre and the shock silence of the full house during the first alien encounter. As a kid from the 89's how many times did you yell out ""LETS ROCK"" randomly."
Baschkenshaala,"Dec 21, 2020",10/10,If anything deserves rating 10 it's Alien and Aliens. Can't get better than this. 34 years after it was released it still is unchallenged. Truely a masterpiece.
ryanfarnin,"Dec 15, 2017",6/10,"Loved this movie as a kid, & even more when the directors cut came out.But its a massive turkey.If you take out all the Military jargon you're left with about 30 minutes of script/Dialog.& the last Arc of the movie - I usually just switch it off now.Decent Sci-Fi up until Ripley goes back into the complex to save Newt.Cringe-worthy family friendly Alien movie, with very little actual Horror!"
tdavidson-60822,"May 24, 2022",10/10,"It's not just one of the best movies from the 80s but still holds up very well in 2022. An outstanding sequel and hell of a cast put together for this sci fi thriller/action film which is truly iconic. Obviously Ripley is the star but Hudson,Hicks and Vasquez really steal the show. Newt, Bishop, Apone and Drake were underrated in their roles as well. Can't forget about the cowardice, snake-like Burke either who really makes you despise him. Fantastic movie with plenty of thrills, action, humor and story that will have you revisiting time and again if not already."
auuwws,"Apr 21, 2021",9/10,"A great movie surpassed the first part, in my opinion, the story in this part was better than the first part, but most of the soldiers' characters were bad, especially Vasquez, who was one of the worst characters in the movies before me, and Jenette Goldstein's acting was very bad, although I did not like Ellen's character Ripley is in Part 1, but Part 2 made me change my mind about it. I felt like the movie was more of an action thriller than a horror movie, few scenes terrified me in the movie, but it's still a great movie and I'd recommend watching it. My rating for the movie is 8.5."
sanctummorium,"Jun 23, 2022",10/10,"I LOVED this movie! The intense action, the gripping horror, the characters, the aliens, the ascetic...everything. And it takes its time to give us all the little hints and clues from the first film as we venture into this thrilling ride. Though I have much respect for Ridley Scott's first Alien film, this one just takes it to a whole new level in a way the first never could. THIS is how it's done."
nytol1-798-466578,"Sep 19, 2021",9/10,"I've just seen this at the cinema for the first time, as I was only 10 when it was originally released.I've seen this movie probably 50 times in the last 33 years, and it is still an awesome classic.There were only a few seconds here and there where it showed it's age, and they could easily be cut with nothing lost.The lack of CGI and constant quick cuts made for an indescribable experience.Modern movie makers could learn a great deal from looking back, rather than forward.With the exception of 'Nobody', I genuinely can't remember the last time I saw what I'd consider to be a great movie?"
amesmonde,"Mar 10, 2010",N/A,"The planet from Alien (1979) has been colonised, but contact is lost and a rescue team is dispatched. This 1986 sequel is action packed, bigger, louder, very gung-ho with Vietnam parallels.I'm torn I must say that at the time Aliens was the best action sci-fi films ever and probably still is, but overtime, I have grown less fond of Aliens and prefer the first Alien and re-edit of the 3rd.What is superior about Aliens is that it builds on what Ridley Scott created in first film, (even though some of Aliens ideas are based on cut scenes) surprise killings, misdirection and so on. The design and movement of the Alien is greatly improved, making the Alien far more menacing and agile than before. Space is stark, dark and cold and James Cameron captures the isolation and ominous atmosphere perfectly, with an effective use of lighting, shadow and set design.There's no doubt that Cameron is an exceptional director and writer. All the characters are built up slowly, Lance Henriksen as the synthetic Bishop and Paul Reiser as Burke give subtle performances. Michael Biehn as Hicks and Sigourney Weaver are terrific. Ripley as a character is fleshed out further and the effects and sound are amazing (winning Best Visual Effects and Best Sound Effects).Aliens is an unsurpassed solid sci-fi horror sequel packed with action and suspense but in retrospect it really is Alien pumped with more Ripley, testosterone and guns."
anton-6,"Sep 29, 2001",6/10,I haven´t seen any of the other Alien films so I don´t know if they are good.The acting by most of the cast is bad and it´s pretty silly.But the special effects it´s amazing and overall it´s pretty exciting but Terminator 2 is much better.RATING:3+ out of  5
WAYNE76,"Sep 8, 2022",10/10,"Seven years since the original ALIEN that in my opinion was premature by decade, This re-boot offers a world of spectacular effects clearly absent from the original when a crack commando search and rescue team accompany Ripley to the Alien planet that is now inhabited by tera formers, Super hi-tech weaponry and vehicles provide the Sci-Fi magic and the creature effects are another level for this non CGI masterpiece. A by the numbers mission turns into anything but when these commandos find out that Ripley's Xenomorphs are no BUG HUNT. James Cameron produces another world class effort here and after the success of TERMINATOR you can say no more, again spawning a timeless franchise these movies are untouchable and still unmatched by any modern cinema magic...probably the best Sci-Fi movie ever made highly recommended."
yourfavoritecritic,"Aug 1, 2017",7/10,"Seven years after the release of Ridley Scott's Alien, James Cameron took the helm of the sequel, Aliens, starring Sigourney Weaver and Bill Paxton. Aliens, picks up five decades in the future, with the discovery of Ripley still in her cryo-chamber. After her recovery, Ripley is tasked with a rescue mission, to find out what happened to a group of colonists after their signal has been lost. Alongside Ripley, is a military group that brings heavy machinery and firepower, but is it enough to put an end to what is going on, on the colonist's moon?Hailed as one of the best in the series, and an iconic action film, I went to Aliens with pretty high expectations, and left feeling completely underwhelmed. The film itself felt very generic, and slow, I was never completely interested in what was happening on screen, so much of the film sets up to these huge action moments, and though the sequences were well choreographed and cool, everything else about this film felt very bland. Many of the characters in this film were just complete morons and never found myself rooting for them. Outside of Ripley, I did not like one character. I'm not sure whether that was Cameron's intention, but with so much of the film based around these military personals, and their development, I couldn't wait to see some of them die. Now if the army boneheads weren't aggravating enough, the filmmakers thought it'd be a brilliant idea to bring a child into the mix, and oh, man. What a mistake that was. I can understand the writer's choice to add Newt as a character to the story, as it adds more dilemma to the plot, however most of the time, it just seemed like a plot convenience to further extended the runtime of the climax and the actresses chosen to bring Newt to life was just awful. Many of her awkward line deliveries and forced screams, so rather than care about this character, I just found myself getting annoyed.Now this film isn't all bad, like I was saying the action in this film is fantastic, and the practical effects used, really held up and still looked good to this day. It's just a shame that this movie suffers so much from being uninspired, I never felt moments of intensity and half the time I was just bored. Maybe it's because I've seen films like this done better nowadays, and it's just a movie stuck in its time, or my feelings of disdain towards this movie, is drawn to the concept mainly being used in a science-fiction horror movie and not sci-fi action.I've seen this movie a couple times now, and both times, I've felt bored and disappointed, I can see the love some individuals have for this film, but it is just not for me. It is a competent film, however it suffers from weak characters and a lack of originality. If you were a fan of Alien, I would recommend checking this film out, just know it is not for everyone and definitely not perfect, Aliens gets a 5/10."
hall895,"Oct 8, 2013",4/10,"The first Alien film is considered a classic but I didn't particularly like it. This sequel is also considered a classic and I like this one even less than the first. At least the first one had a little tension. This one is just a shoot-em-up action thriller. See Aliens, shoot Aliens. Repeat as necessary. This makes for a thriller which is not particularly thrilling. Things get rather repetitive and monotonous. The film can't surprise us, we already know what the Alien is, what it's capable of. This time there are just more of them.The film picks up with our heroine Ellen Ripley awaking from a 57-year nap. While she was dozing a human colony has been established on the planet where she encountered the Alien all those years ago. In an amazingly convenient plot contrivance contact with that colony is lost soon after Ripley wakes up. Gee, what could have happened? A reluctant Ripley is sent back out into space with a team of Colonial Marines to investigate. These Marines are, by and large, idiots. They get to the colony. Surprise, nobody's there! Oh wait, they do find one survivor, a little girl who spends the rest of the movie screeching ""Ripley!"" at the top of her lungs in exceedingly annoying fashion. Speaking of annoying the most idiotic of the idiotic Marines is Pvt. Hudson, played in excruciatingly terrible fashion by Bill Paxton. With this character we're talking Jar Jar Binks levels of annoying. Just shut up. Please. Every time this guy opens his mouth you dearly wish an Alien would turn up and devour him.In the first film Ripley was not the only character you cared about. There the rest of the crew, with one notable exception, were sympathetic figures as well. No such luck here. There's one guy, Corporal Hicks, who comes off reasonably well. The rest are a collection of morons, jerks and slimeballs. With an incredibly annoying child thrown in to boot. Sigourney Weaver does the best she can, turning in a solid performance as Ripley. But she gets precious little help. Michael Biehn is pretty good as Hicks and Lance Henriksen has some good moments as an android but everyone else is quite terrible. Paxton goes way beyond terrible, he is truly wretched. The story, such as it is, doesn't thrill you. The movie takes its sweet time getting to the Alien planet and once we get there it's just a shooting gallery. Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. More Aliens attack, they get shot. Eventually we come to the big finish. Here the movie does have some surprises for you if you haven't already lost interest. But ultimately this ending, like everything which precedes it, falls flat. The climactic battle is visually impressive but really quite silly. Honestly you can say that about the film as a whole. It looks good but the story is a dud. Genuine frightful moments are very few and far between. Suspense is sorely lacking. Characters say and do some of the stupidest things. And an Alien apparently knows how to work an elevator. Going up? No, this movie is going down, crash-landing with a thud."
shaikhirshad-41223,"Aug 2, 2025",9/10,"A James Cameron classic - that's the first thing that comes to mind after watching this phenomenal sequel. While the original Alien leaned heavily into horror and suspense, Aliens shifts gears into a full-blown sci-fi action thriller - and it does so brilliantly.James Cameron's effort is evident in every frame. From the fast-paced, gripping screenplay to the bold shift in tone, he delivers a cinematic experience that's as intense as it is satisfying. The direction is sharp, the character buildup is compelling, and the visuals are stunning. Cameron's use of slick camera work, grounded world-building, and top-notch cinematography creates an immersive battlefield where danger lurks in every corridor.Though I personally wished for a touch more horror, Aliens compensates with high-octane tension, emotional stakes, and a third act that absolutely explodes with adrenaline. The climax will pump you up with its explosive action blocks and unforgettable confrontation.When it comes to performances, Sigourney Weaver is the shining star. From start to finish, she commands the screen with powerful presence, resilience, and depth. Her character arc is executed masterfully - evolving Ripley from survivor to fearless protector. The supporting cast also deserves credit for delivering solid performances that elevate the intensity of the story.The music and sound design add another layer of brilliance - especially the haunting Alien score that kicks in during key moments, sending chills every time.Overall, Aliens is a rare sequel that not only lives up to its predecessor but redefines its genre with action-heavy flair, spectacular visuals, masterful direction, and unforgettable performances. An edge-of-your-seat sci-fi thriller that firmly holds its place in cinema history."
taldarus,"Jul 17, 2021",9/10,"This, like it's original, is really two or even three smaller stories that are all entwined. It is also masterfully done, and a personal treasure. I have definitely watched this movie too many times.It is also nothing like the original. It is very definitely an action movie. Don't expect the same story and you should enjoy this movie."
Kysugo,"Jul 7, 2025",9/10,"The opening credits with the font and the ominous music is so good. James Cameron is definitely able to capture the creepiness and atmosphere that made the first movie so iconic. But here, he takes it up a notch with all the fast-paced action, bigger cast and explosions. It's definitely more 80's. Sound design and soundtrack are immaculate. The visuals/imagery are impressive, memorable and iconic. The cinematography is on point. It's such a masterfully put together movie. A really well made movie. I love how they setup the premise, almost feels like a video game. I love Bill Paxton, he's great in this. Ripley really shows how badass she is in this movie. Going into the nest all by herself takes some immensely huge cojones. The way the aliens crawl along the walls is terrifying. The reveal of the Queen is so good, very effective. Her concept design is terrifying. The sound of the alarms is so anxiety-inducing.There's great ideas in this movie - the cargo loader mech is just one of many. It's a fast-paced movie that doesn't waste any time. They do an amazing job building tension. It's suspenseful and intense. The set designs/pieces and lighting are immaculate. The movie makes good commentary on corporations and how they try to profit/capitalize on anything, even on dangerous unknown creatures - typical. A must-watch! One of the best sequels of all time and a staple in the sci-fi action genre. Raw score: 9.0/10."
stupid_llama,"Jul 31, 2025",6/10,"Aliens definitely dials up the action compared to the original, trading in the slow-burn dread for a more full-throttle war-movie feel. It's bigger, louder, and filled with memorable one-liners and high-intensity moments. You can tell James Cameron wanted this one to move.The cast has some strong personalities, and Sigourney Weaver keeps things grounded with another solid performance. The creature effects still look great, and the atmosphere has that gritty, lived-in sci-fi feel that holds up. But for me, some of the suspense and sharpness from the first film got a little lost in the noise.I get why people love this one, and it's absolutely a fun ride. I just didn't connect with it as much as I hoped. It's a solid sequel, no question, but it leans so hard into action that the tension doesn't always land the same way."

Geeky Randy,"Sep 2, 2010",4/10,"Sequel to one of the greatest sci-fi/horror films ever made—a genre so difficult to execute so wonderfully—comes along and sucks out any horror aspect that made ""Alien"" so fantastic. Instead, James Cameron replaces Ridley Scott in the director's seat and inserts sci-fi clichés and predictable thriller aspects, resulting in this overlong and unnecessary picture.Cameron seems to spend a good length developing characters that are either unlikable and just there for the sake of dying, with a total disregard for driving the story forward. Even in comparing character development to ""Alien"", the sequel proves weaker. ""Alien"" was able to develop deeper and realistic characters in a much shorter timeframe, and didn't need more characters than the story required.Anything new to Cameron's picture is nothing more than convenient plot-devices, thus lacking any shred of cleverness. Aside from Weaver's presence, the film hardly reminds us of the original. The film leaps too forward without any respect for its roots, totally lacking gratefulness.At no point in the film is it easy to actually point out how ""Aliens"" is a necessary/needed follow up. The film may very well have worked better as it's own with all new characters and no continuity to ""Alien"", but it simply just doesn't work as a follow up; which is actually disappointing because if you want to look at what a ""good"" sequel is, Cameron accomplished it with ""Terminator 2: Judgment Day"". Everything on which the story stands relies on ""The Terminator"", however it doesn't need the ""remember when""s to move forward. With ""Aliens"", the story itself is not heavily relied on by ""Alien"", and again, pretty much Weaver is our only feeling of continuation. And again, given the fact that it's just a small and irrelevant reminder, the movie simply doesn't work as a sequel but rather a film of it's own. The fact of the matter is, it's not a film of its own; ""Aliens"" is a sequel, and it simply wasn't done right.Was it entertaining? Sure, whatever. But upon examining filmmaking basics, however, the film fails at the follow up aspect story-wise and goes way off in a direction of its own. That's not a bad thing if it's an original movie. It's not even a bad thing for a sequel of the film shows heavy purpose in the decision to ranch off.After watching ""Aliens"", if the question rose: ""Why does this particular story need to be a follow up to 'Alien'? What is it about 'Alien' that this film needs to be in the same continuity?"" The answer is that it doesn't. ""Alien"" was a successful film, therefore the studio can have a head-start at making another film by throwing in meaningless nods and references to the successful film preceding it in hopes that this film (""Aliens"") will be just as successful. Cameron probably wouldn't even be able to give a solidly confident contradiction to this claim.** (out of four)"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Apr 22, 2008",8/10,"One of the problems of these is that each director, albeit to varying degrees, were selfish... not only adding their respective styles and touches to their separate efforts, each also tried to make theirs the definite piece(and little was left for the next director to work with). I won't claim that Cameron wasn't, as well... nor for a second deny that he by far had the best starting place(you'll know what I mean if you've watched the first, and perhaps also this... and if you haven't, you shouldn't find out from any other source)... but darn it if he doesn't live up to it and deliver the goods(not everyone manages to, no matter how solid the hand they're dealt is). Where the first has adequate atmosphere, this has it in spades. It had maybe three or four jump scares, this is continually exciting(this actually affected me far more often, and typically more lasting). This also has humor. It looks magnificent, technically and visually speaking. I'm afraid I just cannot claim that I see how Alien measures up to this. Effects are superior(how much better could they really have gotten in seven years? Besides, if you can't get something to look convincing on the screen, why are you putting it up there?). Characters are interesting and strong. The action is awesome, some of the best for the genres(I'm not kiddin'). Direction is effective all the way, and James just gets something much more satisfying, entertaining and engaging out of the title creature. This takes the next logical step in the franchise, and does so almost flawlessly. The plot is marvelous. Pacing is excellent, this is never boring(neither version). Acting is about spot-on(and frankly much more involving and involved than that of its predecessor, with Weaver, Henriksen(nailing his performance unbelievably well), Biehn(by far one of my favorite male actors, and when James Cameron directs him, it gets kicked up a notch of considerable size) and Henn(9 years old, and so talented) being just the top picks in a film which seems devoid of poor performances. Paxton provides perfect comic relief, without being goofy or lame. The sci-fi aspects of the film are also amazing(not to ignore what Alien did have, which should also be noted), and everything about the Marines is great, cool and obviously very thought through. The Special Edition holds about 17 minutes more material, and it's invariably worth the extra time. That cut also has a commentary track, and it is rather good... Bill and Michael are so fun to listen to, and their camaraderie comes off so genuine(though they do also all partake in the, one would presume, mandatory love-fest), Gale, Stan Winston and James have quite a bit to say... even Carrie, if she doesn't throw her two cents in as much, is a pleasant inclusion. All in all, the best of the series, and definitely the most intense(and perhaps scary) of them. I recommend it to fans of Cameron and/or of the Alien series. 8/10"
moviesareawayoflife,"Jul 2, 2023",10/10,"Aliens is rightly regarded by many as a classic and for good reason too. The film serves as a continuation of the story set up by Alien, but expands on that narrative, and features non stop action and horror. Directed by James Cameron this has his visual direction stamped all over it, and he really was in his prime in this period of time. The casting is perfection no weak performances with Sigourney Weaver giving an even better performance than in Alien. The marines have some recognisable faces with Michael Biehn and Bill Paxton among them with Paxton putting in a brilliant performance as a marine unravelling at the seams. The tension in the film is allowed to build up slowly allowing us to get to know the characters and then for the last 90 minutes it is all out action and war. Instantly quotable and suitably horrifying Aliens hits the mark in every way. This is a film i revisit a lot and for very good reason, it is a classic of its genre. Just don't ask me to pick my favourite film between Alien and Aliens....."
TheDeadMayTasteBad,"Jul 3, 2008",9/10,"... and there's a reason the summary headline is in quotations-- it gets thrown around a lot when referring to this film. Rightfully so.Perhaps what separates 'Aliens' from all of the other sequels that followed 1979s 'Alien' is that it has heart. Not only are we entrenched in the stark, gritty and imaginative future that Cameron has built for us- we are emotionally connected to it. And how's that so? Well, it is the product of much hard work and imagination. Whether you appreciate the sequel as much as the original or not, 'Alien' never attempts to copy or even ""outdo"" its predecessor. Instead, director James Cameron respects what Ridley Scott accomplished in the first film and takes it in a completely new direction while maintaining the dynamic presence of Weaver's Ripley as a key means of continuity.The characters are the heart of the film and the unfamiliar world in 'Aliens'. We even become attached to a android (who would have suspected that, especially after 'Alien'?). In just a few scenes, there is more humanity established in Michael Biehn's Cpl. Dwayne Hicks than in any other buff and brawn character in the future sequels.Another key factor to the films' greatness is its special effects, crafted by the (late, sadly) Stan Winston. I have a feeling that even years from now, moviegoers will still look back on this film as one of the greatest technical accomplishments in cinema's special effects history.As a adolescent boy, 'Aliens' was my favorite entry into the series. It was full of testosterone, centered in atmosphere, and riddled with some of the most imaginative and coolest characters and creatures ever placed on film. It still remains a favorite to this day."
mockay,"Jul 24, 2006",9/10,"There have got to be very few people left in the world who actually have'nt seen or been blown away by Aliens. If you are part of that really small minority, and really have to log on to the net and read reviews about this movie in order for you to decide whether to check it out or not, then you are a really sad person. Unless you're really young, you have missed the best movie ever made in entertainment history. I really hope that one has'nt been unlucky enough to have seen Alien-3, Alien resurrection or God forbid, AVP, before actually having seen Alien and Aliens for the first time. To maximize your enjoyment and understanding of Aliens, watch Alien-1 first and then go buy a home theater or locate a cinema hall where this is running and then only see it. While you can still watch it on DVD over and over again, a home theater or cinema would do the movie justice."
crukeg,"Feb 17, 2007",10/10,"In aliens, elen ripley is rescued by a military establishment that have sent colonies to lv246 (the planet on which the first alien came from). She joins them in their quest to reestablish contact after it is lost. However, the team are bombarded with monstrous aliens after finding a young girl called newt on board. Ellen makes a srtong bond with the youngster and vows to rescue her after she's kidnapped. And the ending is a complete rollecoaster of thrills and sheer horror.Sigourney weaver was fantastic in this (well deserved Oscar nod), and the action was non-stop. I prefer this to the first, which is a huge achievement in my mind.Watch aliens, you won't be disappointed."
dieseldemon85,"Nov 29, 2021",8/10,"I saw Alien (1979) at a scary movie marathon in 2020. It was ok, but found it dull in spots, and most of characters unlikable. Now for Aliens (1986), moves at a much faster pace and keeps your interest from beginning to end. The characters in this film are more likable, and newt's acting was very well done."
DonaldDooD,"Aug 30, 2014",6/10,"Alien was a suspenseful, sci-fi horror film. Aliens decided to add more aliens and abandon most of the suspense and horror in exchange for action. That'd be fine, if it weren't so meat-headed.The first major problem is the film uses a large number of people as cannon fodder, nothing else. Nothing is more infuriating than when an action film has absolutely no respect for human life. These mercenaries are annoying jock stereotypes whose death has zero effect on me. Seriously, these wastes of space have no wonder or fear over monstrous aliens? Nuts to that. Those scenes sucked.The other issue is how the action is shot. Normally, cinematography is not something I pay attention to. Its like controls in video games - its just assumed you can shoot stuff right. Maybe some rare talent can create something impressive. But its impossible to ignore how jumpy the camera gets when the action picks up. Gunfire, CUT, alien screams, CUT, guy fires again, CUT, guy gets bitten, CUT, show his face, CUT, back to his arm. Jesus Christ, calm down! You don't need to hide these special effects!Once the mercenaries are decimated, and the camera decides to act normal, it gets better. Once again, the setting and effects are great. You truly believe we are on some different planet. And the aliens are as intimidating as ever, although some of their majesty is lost since they're killed so often. And the ending is pretty awesome. The characterization has improved, too. It could have been better, but I had a greater idea on who Ripley was. I'm iffy on Newt - she doesn't add much to the story, but she does provide a contrast between Ripley and Newt and the xenomorphs.Aliens is far from a perfect action film. Even ignoring higher standards for art, some scenes destroy their own suspense. Sure, its pretty good. IMDb Top 250? I don't think so."
M-and-A,"Feb 17, 2009",3/10,"Average imagination and average aims must be the combination behind this alien sequel. To take an example near the beginning, the capsules where the spaceship crew sleep are shot three times over from a very boring perspective (the foot of the beds slanted in a row to the left, the edge of the first bed slanted to the right); or, when part of the crew are investigating a tunnel where aliens might be hiding, the two men and a woman are pictured from the front, at the knee level, as in a tourist photograph.These ordinary camera angles would not matter, if the director was not only interested in technology but also people. But besides Sigourney Weaver's Ripley we have vehicles for one-liners. I just appreciate it if several people in a film are given some character: it does not have to be more complicated than, say, the four different old men in Clint Eastwood's ""Space Cowboys"" (2000). Also, I failed to notice any special amount of humour, which some say is there. Regrettably, Cameron's alien is just a competent action film, with good acting by Weaver."
hitchcockthelegend,"Sep 18, 2009",10/10,"Ripley has been found in deep space by a salvage ship and brought back to a space station to be awoken from her 57 year sleep. Here she is mortified to find that the planet on which herself and her now deceased Nostromo crew found the Alien, LV-426, has been colonised by Weyland-Yutani Company. Suffice to say that when The Company representative, Burke, tells her that all contact is lost, she's not in the least bit surprised. Unable to get anyone to believe her about what happened to the Nostromo crew, Ripley is cajoled into going back to LV-426 with a crack team of space marines to seek, destroy or rescue...How do you make a sequel to one of the finest, most loved modern era films ever? This was something that director James Cameron must have pondered on many a dark night once he had agreed to make Aliens. The answer was to rightly not copy the format so brilliantly laid down by Ridley Scott and his team for Alien, but to embrace its mood and enhance it with thrills spills and exhilaration. This was only Cameron's third feature length movie, and here he was working with the crew who had made Scott's movie so special. Also writing as well as directing, this could have gone very wrong indeed, but Cameron rose to the challenge admirably and set up his marker on how his film would succeed. Keep the premise simple and seamlessly connected to Scott's film, and lets have more. Not just one bad ass acid bleeding alien, but an army of them, and their mother too!They mostly come at night - mowstly.Where Alien was a splicing of sci-fi wonderment and basic horror terrors, Aliens is a blend of war film staples to compliment both of those earlier picture things. Thus in keeping with Cameron's more is more work in progress skeleton. Another thing that Cameron instinctively called right was to make Aliens about Ripley (Sigorney Weaver simply brilliant), it's her story. Be it a parental thread or a feminist heroine fighting off the phallic hoards, cinema got in Ripley's extension one of its finest and strongest female characters ever (Weaver was nominated for Best Actress but lost out to Marlee Matlin for Children of a Lesser God).Thematically Aliens has been pored over in regards to metaphors about Vietnam, foreign policy and corporate greed at any cost, and rest assured that Aliens isn't merely one big excuse for a shoot them up bonanza. But realistically, and explaining why it was such a huge box office success, it's with the thrills and terror that Aliens most succeeds. The action scenes are slick and at times breath taking, and the tension is often palpable. None more so as we enter the film at the half way point, because here we realise that we have characters to care about. Blood, brains and brawn, all led by a heroine of considerable guile and guts. 10/10"
Luv2Spooge,"Sep 24, 2022",10/10,"If you want to read praises on this film, there are many reviews here you can read. What I like to mention is how this film set the standard for other sci-fi and eventually created a subgenre of its own. Many overlooked the originality of this film, this was the first. Every idea, concept, in this film from the marines being overwhelmed by a horde of aliens to even the simple drop ship was original and would influence future sci-fi to come.One most obvious comparison is Starcraft, which borrowed many elements from this film. Some would even say that story aside, Starcraft was essentially Aliens the video game and they gone pro with various mutations and form. Movies like Edge of Tomorrow, The Tomorrow War, etc... are also heavily influenced by this film.This is what 80s/90s were all about; action, originality, entertainment, and none of the problems which plagued today's entertainment business. Anyone noticed Private Velasquez, praised for being a strong female minority character in the film, was played by Jenette Goldstein? She's actually Jewish who played John Connor's stepmother in Terminator 2. Yet nobody back then cared about that, they only cared she was an awesome character. Why? Because back then people weren't filled with the ""message"" of hate and division.10/10."
jzappa,"Jul 16, 2007",9/10,"Ridley Scott's superb Alien opens in a completely foreign atmosphere, making us want to be there, attracting us mysteriously. The camera moves around slowly and quietly, exploring this place, and it makes us want to be there. This is how he elusively draws us in and begins building suspense right under our noses. James Cameron's Aliens is too impatient. There is no build-up of suspense, there are constant close-ups, everybody's made up to look attractive, and the exposition is only long because it seems to think that extension equals suspense, or that there's some quota to fill and then you can play around with your big guns and gore all you want. Cameron presents us with an action film, big fun, special effects, blow this up, blow that up, but there is an hour and 45 minutes of waiting around for it, and less than an hour of action and violence. There is a good 20 minutes of nonstop action that is actually paced quite well and feels very intense, but it's aggravating to be kept from it for so long just so the film can appear as patient and effective as the original.The original Alien knew the magic of claustrophobia and the effect it can have. Cameron's nature is to do everything he can to outdo. So, he makes a bigger movie, with a bigger cast, and a bigger spaceship and bigger, louder scenes of violence, when that is not what you need to outdo the first Alien. There's nothing wrong with making the sequel more of an action film than a suspense film, but instead, he donned the film with the appearance of being patiently suspenseful and, since the film is about a big bunch of marines going to blow everything up and the film makes no attempt to be subtle, all we're doing is sitting and waiting, whereas in Ridley Scott's original, we were sitting bruising our dates' forearms.One thing I must add though, is that Jennette Goldstein should've become something bigger than she was. She is a fantastic actress, and extremely hot at that. She's the biggest highlight next to Bill Paxton here in Aliens, as she is to Paxton in Cameron's once wife Bigelow's Near Dark. She should've become a star."
ryanskywalker-87402,"May 16, 2017",10/10,"There are very few sequels out there that have managed to surpass the originals and overcome the expectations of the first chapter's loyal & faithful fans. And James Cameron's Aliens is one film that accomplishes exactly that by taking the universe of Ridley Scott's Alien and expanding upon it in ways most sequels are afraid to, for this second chapter is much bigger & more action-packed than its predecessor, and succeeds not only as a great sci-fi horror but as a redefinition of action filmmaking as well.The story of Aliens takes place 57 years after the events of the first film & concerns the solo survivor Ripley, whose account of what happened on the planet is dismissed by her executives as the very desolate planet is now inhabited by humans. Things are set in motion when the contact with the planet is lost & Ripley is requested to join a group of space marines to investigate, which she refuses at first but joins in eventually in order to face & overcome her fears once n for all.Written & directed by James Cameron, it's so heartwarming to see him expanding the universe of the previous film instead of crafting a loose sequel of Alien by repeating the same concept of the first film. Cameron in my opinion is an extremely talented filmmaker not because he knows what great action is all about but because he's always able to back it up with a highly compelling story which is further elevated by jaw-dropping visuals. And this film is a perfect testament to that.While Alien was a slow building masterpiece of atmospheric tension, Aliens replaces the survival horror of its predecessor with a highly intense, bombastic & violent war between two species. And even though there is less suspense in this film than the last chapter, Cameron makes up for it by turning his feature into an action- thriller filled with intense moments of relentless terror & highly potent combat sequences which ultimately culminates with a bone- chilling climax, that is executed to perfection.Coming to the performances, while Alien gave equal importance to each of its characters, Aliens places more emphasis on Ripley and is basically her journey from undergoing severe traumatic nightmares caused due to the events of the first film to facing her fears head on in this sequel. And Cameron has penned down her character with extreme care by providing Ripley more depth & emotional dimensions to explore, which Weaver makes full use of to deliver a career-best performance while also becoming the first real female action figure in cinema.The supporting cast is no slouch either as just like the previous film, there are almost no death fodders in this and the space marines are one bunch of badass characters, each nicely written & given a distinct personality. As for its technical achievements, the art direction & set designs may not have surpassed the artistic levels set in the previous film but it certainly comes close. Visual Effects however is groundbreaking, sound is expertly carried out and James Horner's score perfectly balances the tone of the film throughout the runtime.On an overall scale, James Cameron's Aliens is a wildly entertaining, immensely satisfying & one spectacular roller-coaster ride of non- stop action that refuses to age even after three decades and continues to rank amongst the most intense & fulfilling pieces of action extravaganzas ever made. Arguably the best film of the franchise, certainly one of the greatest sequels of all time, and undoubtedly one of the finest & most influential examples of its genre(s), Aliens is a perfect follow-up to Alien and, just like its predecessor, is immortal for its contribution to cinema."
HigashiFilmEnthusiast,"Apr 9, 2023",10/10,"As a fan since my early years, Aliens stands out as one of the action films from the '80s that remains on par with modern movies of the twenty-first century. After experiencing the first Alien film, I anticipated a continuation of its horror and suspense in Aliens. While it indeed maintains those aspects, it goes beyond with the perfect infusion of humor that balances out the intense action sequences.The action in Aliens is nothing short of flawless, with the effects team truly outdoing themselves. The aliens and the queen are rendered incredibly, and the cinematography of the action scenes amplifies the thrill factor to the max. Every moment on screen is a visual spectacle that keeps you at the edge of your seat.However, what truly sets Aliens apart is its unforgettable characters. Each one is memorable and terrific in their own right, making you genuinely care for them throughout the runtime. You fear for their safety every time the aliens attack, as the chemistry among the actors enhances the realism of their performances.Aliens is a movie that should be on the must-watch list for anyone who loves sci-fi or simply enjoys movies. Its gripping storytelling and engaging action will make two hours feel like a mere couple of minutes. From beginning to end, Aliens continues to captivate me, and it remains a film that I can rewatch endlessly and still be enthralled by its charm."
enlight,"Oct 8, 2000",N/A,"Perhaps the best praise in a review is brevity. This is the single best science fiction film ever made.Cameron is an obsessive genius, with a fixation on detail and obsessive consistency that makes Lucas and Spielberg look like a couple of Troma interns. The ""hard"" special effects, executed by some of the best in the business on carte blanche budgets, are what make the current digital state of the art look fake. The acting is on target and the story is dark, cerebral, inventive, and as utterly believable as it is fantastic. A standard is set here which has never been matched since - this movie makes the Matrix look like a bad Barney episode. I must warn you, seriously, that once you see this, you will be ruined for other science fiction forever."

TakeTwoReviews,"Jan 4, 2025",6/10,"I've kicked off 2025 watching all the Alien films in order, that's the plan anyway. Some I've seen before, some will be new to me. Aliens is a rewatch. James Cameron takes over from Ridley Scott and it shows. Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) is back and now very much the focal point and the star. We meet her here in hypersleep on the frozen ship she escaped in at the end of Alien. Rescued, but now on a space station, she meets Burke (Paul Reiser). An irritating company man, he'll only get more annoying as the film goes on, but that's his point. The tech has all improved, that's because she's been floating in space for 57 years. The average IQ hasn't though. The bureaucrats don't believe her story... but they'll soon realise they need her. It turns out that planet where the Alien ship was found last time, is now in the process of being colonised by workers that soon discover they're not alone and off we go again. All the slow build tension of the original is tossed out the window. I guess we've seen how a face-hugger works, but this is still clunky. The company lose touch with the colony... obviously and ask Ripley to return, with a bribe to give her back her officer status after destroying her last ride. Ripley though only has one reason to return, to wipe the Aliens out. Cue a tooled up rag-tag bunch of soldiers accompanying her back in to deep space. All instantly dislikable, not a brain cell between them. Dull dialogue machines. Honestly Cameron, he really is a terrible director. One of the few characters, alongside Ripley, with any nuance is Bishop (Lance Henriksen) and he's an Android, which of course Ripley isn't keen on. To be honest with all the ridiculous yahoo American bravado, I'm rooting for the Aliens to kill em all. As the team reach the colony planet, it's like Vietnam in space. A handy atmosphere stabilising machine does away with the need for space suits though, so really this could be anywhere. I mean, why on earth are they wearing camouflage gear. All its many issues and monolithic inaccuracies aside, it is a good suspenseful action thriller. Weaver, although given some terrible lines is great and the Aliens are of course fantastic. It benefits a lot from everything set-up in the original, but adds little to it. It knows it's ace are the Aliens, so we're made to wait. Slowly teasing. The discovery of Newt (Carrie Henn), the last survivor of the colony adds a little more sentiment to all the posturing and she does add at least one more character that you want to survive. It does look good too. A nice mix of scrungy of the time miniatures that look cool and occasionally a bit Thunderbirds. The budget has clearly gone on the Aliens, that quite frankly still look incredible. Trapped, the remaining cast go full A-Team as they try to make it to the end of the bloated 140 minute runtime and eliminate the Aliens. Except that's not the brief is it. This is the era of the franchise boom that we're still suffering. If you don't like endless films bleeding an idea dry, blame this... and Rocky. It's a terrible sequel considering what it had to work with, but the finale, nuts as it is, is undeniably iconic and worth sticking around for."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jan 17, 2016",10/10,"Whereas the first, and original, ""Alien"" movie from 1979 was more of a thriller / horror Sci-Fi movie in space, then this 1986 continuation steps it up a notch and turns it into a fast paced action movie. I could imagine that some fans of the 1979 movie would not particularly enjoy this change of genre, but personally I did enjoy it quite a lot. In fact, I think that ""Aliens"" is the best movie of the entire ""Alien"" franchise so far.What makes ""Aliens"" special to me is a myriad of things. First and foremost it is the abundance of alien creatures that are present in this movie. Sure, the cat-and-mouse chase from the 1979 movie with a single alien was nice. But having a whole hive of aliens running around in the 1986 was just much more menacing. And the slight evolution and changes made to the alien creatures in this 1986 movie compared to the first movie was also a welcomed detail. Secondly, director James Cameron managed to put a very interesting story to the screen, and he directed the movie quite nicely. Thirdly, the characters in the movie were all very well-detailed and fleshed out to help tell the story of ""Aliens"". And finally, the ensemble of cast, which were just fabulous.""Aliens"" is a definite MUST watch if you enjoy Sci-Fi, and especially if you enjoy the ""Alien"" franchise and universe.The characters portrayed in ""Aliens"" were all quite well-detailed, as I mentioned above. And they all did add a lot of flavor to the story, despite not giving us much background story to their persons. But their backgrounds were not important here, as they are soldiers and their personalities more than spoke for themselves. The gallery of characters in ""Aliens"" was really good, and a big thumbs up to the team of writers who came up with these characters.Equally impressive was the ensemble of cast hired to portray these fleshed out characters. And this feat is really one of the key ingredients to ""Aliens"" being such an enjoyable movie. Sigourney Weaver is, of course, the embodiment of the franchise, and she had much help from talents performers such as Carrie Henn, Michael Biehn, Paul Reiser, Lance Henriksen and Bill Paxton.The special effects in ""Aliens"" were great, with lots of nice details and personal touches to the individual marines. And the environment was realistic and believable.As I mentioned earlier, ""Aliens"" is the best of all the movies in the franchise. And if you have a chance to watch the special edition or director's cut edition, by all means do so, because it has so much extra contents that just adds a whole new layer of enjoyment to the movie experience."
bowmanblue,"Oct 19, 2014",10/10,"If you're into sci-fi then you should have seen Aliens by now. It's the - not particularly imaginatively - titled sequel to the 1979 'haunted house is space' film Alien. And, depending on how you like your science fiction, will determine exactly which of the two you'll like the best (it's worth noting that whichever one you pick, you'll probably agree that they're both up there with the best science fiction films ever made).Alien is dark, quiet and moody. Its successor is loud, brash and big as it follows the sole survivor of the first film, Ellen Ripley, as she returns to Earth after floating in space for 57 years, only to find that the planet where she first encountered the xenomorph has been colonised. Then - guess what - all contact is lost with colony and she has to accompany a team of space marines in a rescue mission (that does not go well).Sigourney Weaver was nominated for an Oscar for her performance. However, it's hard to pick out a stand-out performance here. It's rare in a movie when you know that half of the cast are going to end up on the wrong end of a monster's teeth to really care about them. Yet, here you find yourself rooting for even the lowliest of cast members.The best part of Aliens (just like Star Wars) is that it's 'timeless.' We're now nearly thirty years on from its creation and yet it still looks as good. The special effects (and general atmosphere) beat anything made today and current films could really take a lead out of its book when it comes to using miniature models over excessive CGI.If you haven't seen Aliens, you should. Normally I would recommend it for fans of the action/sci-fi/horror genres. However, this is a film that defined the genre and has been copied (poorly) to this day (think the Resident Evil films to name but a few). Therefore, I truly believe people that don't always want to watch horror may ever enjoy it (maybe not as much as me, but I think most will appreciate that this is a behemoth in modern film history and should at least be respected, if not adored as much as I do).And remember... there's something moving in here and it ain't us!"
Richie-67-485852,"Jul 8, 2017",10/10,"You never know how a sequel will go. Well this one goes and keeps going and if you are not strapped in you will go too. Suspenseful, intriguing and adventure in space. Throw in some Marines, a good story and who didn't want to see a following to the successful first one called Alien. I remember when the first one ended, I couldn't wait to see where it picks up. I wondered and waited and out came this gem Aliens. Here we have more than one to contend with but we also have a squad of Killer Marines too so lets get it on as they say in this movie. Well get it on they do and the viewer is almost exhausted from rooting and fighting just from their own seat. Non-stop action, good story, outstanding monsters and excellent directing too. It is no wonder this movie was a success too. I have seen this so many times but it still delivers in the moment it is being watched. When I caught this in the movies, it was because my preferred movie was sold out. My family of five quickly bought tickets to this and sat three rows from the front as there were no other seats. We were just glad to get into a show. I looked over at my family and the audience during this flick several times only to see everyone glued to the screen with expressions and emotions on their faces and I wondered do I look like that? LOL yes I did. Excitement and tension does that. There is a scene in this movie where you get the chills more than once but this one stands out. It is when they discover that the Aliens are not just animals but thinking creatures. I have the collectors edition and enjoy the extended version which is almost 2.5 hours long yay! Great movie to eat while watching and popcorn or decent snack a must with a tasty drink. Keep these coming but make them good"
stanheckjrr,"Jun 23, 2017",10/10,"James Cameron improves on the Ridley Scott film. This film is wall to wall action. It really shows how flawed ""Alien"" is. In fact if you watch these films back to back you will see how BORING the 1979 film is!In 1991 when this film was released on Laserdisc James Cameron extended the film. There is several minutes that add depth to many characters. James Cameron would later extend ""Terminator 2"" and ""The Abyss"".Get even more chills and thrills in the Special Edition of Aliens, featuring a custom intro from Academy Award-winning Director James Cameron! The terror continues as Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) returns to Earth after drifting through space in hypersleep for 57 years. Although her story about the Alien encounter is met with skepticism, she agrees to accompany a team of high-teach marine's back to LV- 246... and this time it's war!There has been many more ""Alien"" films produced since this one and non of them are even 1/2 as good!"
chaos-rampant,"Sep 18, 2012",N/A,"You simply cannot fail to study the Alien films. Individually, they range from great to below-average, but the journey and transformation of vision is fascinating and precious. It starts with Dune, the scrapped Jodorowsky version. The ambitious project collapsed, scattering the team of visionaries. In the meantime, Star Wars came out through the more business-savvy Spielberg-Lucas model and convinced execs that something like Dune can be done if you build with dedication from bankable parts instead of trusting genius.Alien was brilliant - all about the dissonance of different kinds of logic working in discovery of the same thing.This is something else entirely. The second explosion was that the Star Wars-Alien success was so immense, pieces of their mechanism rained all over Hollywood: new SFX worlds, ambition, coherent mythology. Several Scott-originated ideas for a second Alien were quickly proposed, most of them dumb (eventually retooled into Prometheus). Lucas had his own. Meanwhile, the Roger Corman factory was hard at work picking apart the films to build their own miniature models. The story goes that a young truck-driver, awestruck by Star Wars, decided to pursue screen writing, and naturally drifted to Corman's stable.Anyway, young Cameron got his break doing second unit work in the Alien-inspired Galaxy of Terror, which led to the Piranha gig. Long before any of us would know him as mogul and overambitious despot on set, the guy was a workhorse, a whiz-kid of DIY filmmaking. And he was getting hands-on practice right in the middle of an assembly-line where he had to puzzle about dressing and refitting all those spare parts. And you can again see all of that in the finished film here, only his second one.Nevermind the shift of tone from horror to action and war. We go from Scott's journey of dissonant discovery to one of efficiently getting a job done. From the shared adventure to uncharted space and new vision, to one woman's obsessive vision of something she knows and has to exterminate.As a result, you go from a film of multiple individually-perfected fabrics and different machinery, remember in Alien you went from Giger's biomechanoid alien ship, to the clean Kubrick-space of Mother's room, to the scrapyard maze of Nostromo's bowels, and different cameras for each space, to one man doing all, one fabric of camera and one practical logic throughout.There is no dissonant intrusion of alien- space and logic, like you had when injecting Moebius and Giger- fluid disharmony into Scott's clean vision. Both humans and aliens exist in the same workshop-space, and that blue-collar workspace of junk, papers and spare parts everywhere must have been the feel of the Corman factory of disassembling vision for study that Cameron intimately knew.And that emphasis on making something work shows in the creature itself (the product of vision) and the introduction of narrative for the encounter with it.In the original, you had the volatile omnipresence in shadows of something mysterious and ever-shifting that was not human at all, but an abstract being you understood had inscrutable biology and purpose. There was no narrative, we knew nothing about it.In Cameron's practical vision that's scaled down from near-metaphysical presence to a much more understood critter, understood both in terms of structure (beehive and presence of a Queen, Cameron-designed no less) and understood in terms of story, motherhood. Meanwhile Ripley herself in that outer space of unreason is slaying her own darkness.Those are not at all bad choices: clarity in both mechanics and narrative logic, practical purpose, no dissonance, efficient tension.It is just different to the original journey, less dangerous. It is a workingman's assembly-vision of what he does, building worlds. It works, he was extraordinarily competent with the parts. So competent in fact, that Spielberg himself had to sit down and take notice."
shakur96,"Jul 24, 2003",6/10,"I enjoyed this film although I disagree with many who thought this was the best of the four. It doesn't touch the first. It may have been made 7 years after Alien but Aliens looks far more dated, probably due to the more frequent and more ambitious special effects. The aerial shots in particular look badly dated, I think that Cameron, unlike Scott bit off more than he could chew in terms of use of technology at the time. Alien has and will continue to stand the test of time.In addition the dialogue is poor and is made worse by one or two sub-standard performances, in particular Bill Paxton who was unconvincing in his nervous, worrying, ""what the f**K are we going to do"" soldier role. Though I enjoyed Paul Reiser & Lance Henriksen playing the roles of the menacing Hicks and the inhuman Bishop.Overall a good film, one of the few good sequel movies, though certainly not worthy of neither the 8.2 score on imdb or the #83 rated movie on imdb (at July 2003). 6.5/10."
tvcunningham,"Feb 26, 2009",10/10,"There's at least a dozen video-games released every year that blatantly rip off it's character, setting and plot. The movie is 23 years old people.No Aliens= No Halo, No Resistance, No Gears of War, No Doom, No Quake, No StarCraft...No random bunch of space marines dropping into enemy territory and blowing it to kingdom come.Now that's saying something.It's got great characters, an awesome slow, suspenseful build of the kind you just don't see anymore, It's got gore, action, emotion and one of, if not the greatest, movie monsters ever...multiplied by 100.If you're a gamer, you have no excuse not to watch this."
alex_with_a_P,"Oct 23, 2021",6/10,"After re-watching both Alien movies since twelve years ago0 I was surprised how much this movie aged compared to Alien. I have to add that my first contact with the Alien franchise was in fact Aliens and I always loved it in the past. As a matter of fact I used to love both movies equally, never holding one in higher regard, since both are different genre films.But ever since revisiting both films, I noticed that the devil is in the detail. Which isn't to say that there aren't any positive things about Aliens, the movie is in itself an achievement with the limited budget and means for the time, it has outstanding practical effects. I also liked the themes of motherhood as a continuation of the 'birth' themes from the first movie.Unfortunately some stuff did not age so well.Let's begin with the dialogue: the dialogue in this movie is very, very cheesy. And although most of the soldiers are well established for their minimal screen time, they are like cartoon characters compared to the tone of the first movie. The Nostromo crew and their banter felt very authentic and is one of the main reasons why the movie feels so relatable although it takes place in a distant time in outer space. Especially a character like Hicks shouldn't be such a blank slate.There's also something very unique about the first Alien movie that none of the sequels (except maybe Alien3) bothered to include and that is the weird sexual undertones. No other sci-fi movie before mixed horror and sexual imagery in a very disturbing way. Not only was it inherent in the designs by HR Giger. But there were horrific scenes like the death of Lambert which was disturbing in the way it was sexually hinted at. Since this is an American movie the sexuality got replaced by fetishism of weapons and guns.The other thing where the movie missed it's mark is the designs of the Alien drones. None of the sequels ran with the original idea of HR Giger to create a bio-mechanical-hybrid creature that no one quite understands. Instead we're introduced to the trend of making the creature more slimy, organic and animal-like. It's baffling how all the sequels (including AvP) dropped the ball on this. Bigger is not always better and although the Alien Queen is beautifully designed, it's shown too often. I get that Stan Winston wanted to showcase his work, but I feel like less would have been more.The cinematography of this film is solid but never reaches the peaks of the first movie. Just compare the great waking up sequence of the crew in the first film with the one in the sequel. They are worlds apart. The other thing is music. The score of the discovery of the alien ship is one of the most haunting scores in cinema history. Whereas Michael Horner delivers a strong orchestral score which is of course more bombastic but also very traditional.I don't want to crap too much on this sequel since it's still one of the better sequels to come out of this franchise. But unfortunately it didn't hold up as well as I wanted it to be."
Theo Robertson,"May 20, 2003",8/10,"I remember having a conversation with a work colleague in 1983 on horror films ( In those days video nasties like I SPIT ON YOUR GRAVE and NIGHT OF THE DEMON were all the rage ) and he mentioned that he thought ALIEN was a great film . "" Hmm "" I replied "" I didn`t think it was that good Benny . It would have been better if there was more people getting killed by lots of aliens and a lot more action "" It could be that James Cameron over heard my conversation and decided he was going to make a sequel solely to please me , but it`s more logical to assume that he recognised the obvious faults of the pretentious arthouse original and went for a no holds action blockbusterI really loved the action setpieces of ALIENS , the flames , the explosions , the gunfire , the high body count and the nerve jangling tension . Cameron does a great job and unlike his later films never goes overboard on the production values and a special mention should go to realistic little things like costume design . All too often directors shoot themselves in the foot by making the future look futuristic and fail because of it , check out UFO , THE GREEN SLIME and SPECE 1999  for a few examples , but here the costumes look very functional as opposed to futuristic . And Cameron has written a very good - though possibly overlong - script . Notice that it has - Unlike his script for RAMBO FIRST BLOOD PART TWO - a slightly left of centre viewpoint with the marines being jingoistic American stereotypes and the bad guy being a corperate capitilist ? This no accident on the part of the screenwriter I`m sureSo with a few rare exceptions like MAD MAX 2 this is a film that outdoes the original . I know that some critics prefer Ridley Scott`s version and they`re entitled to their veiwpoint but Cameron proved the doom mongers ( And there was a lot of them in 1985 )  wrong when they announced that ALIENS wouldn`t come close to equalling never mind surpassing the original .I`ve no idea what Benny thought of ALIENS  though"
mjw2305,"Jan 15, 2005",10/10,"This time its James Cameron who is charged with bringing the alien to the screen, an entirely different approach is used and it has to be said that this sequel is not as scary as the original, however it is slightly better (probably because it was made 7 years later and visual effects were much improved).This time we get to see the alien in all its glory and the frights are due to the sheer number of them terrorising the heavily armed soldiers intent on destroying them.This is definitely less of a horror film and more of an action movie. I think the reason that it works so well is that everyone was is ready to see the aliens in all there terrifying splendour, and had the sequel tried to recreate the suspense of the original would undoubtedly have failed.Sci-Fi action at it's very best 10/10"
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",8/10,"Aliens (1986), directed by James Cameron, takes everything that made Alien a classic and cranks it up to 11. If Alien was about isolation and dread, Aliens is about combat and survival, a perfect blend of sci-fi action and horror that captures the raw intensity of human endurance. Your 8/10 rating reflects its brilliance, though it may still leave some room for those who prefer the slow-burn terror of the original.This sequel catapults Ripley (Sigourney Weaver) back into the fray, this time not as a survivor but as a warrior. The pacing is faster, and the action is more intense, but the film never loses its grip on the horror elements. It opens up the universe, shifting from the haunted spaceship corridors to the gritty, colonial marines setting, and that shift works remarkably well. The change in tone is one of Aliens' greatest strengths-it's not just a monster movie, it's an all-out warzone where Ripley's maternal instincts and newfound strength become a central force in the narrative.Sigourney Weaver's performance is nothing short of legendary. Ripley in Aliens is tougher, more battle-worn, and filled with a new sense of purpose. Her bond with Newt, the young survivor she protects, adds layers of emotion and stakes that elevate the action. Ripley isn't just fighting for her life; she's fighting to protect the innocent, giving her character a deeper emotional complexity that resonates strongly with audiences.The supporting cast, including Bill Paxton's unforgettable Hudson, Michael Biehn's Kyle Reese-style Hicks, and Paul Reiser's sleazy Burke, each bring a unique energy to the film. Paxton's wisecracking, over-the-top performance provides levity amidst the horror, while Biehn's stoic heroism gives Ripley someone to lean on. Reiser, playing the morally questionable company man, creates a perfect foil to the team's camaraderie.Cameron's direction is relentless-every scene, every shot builds toward the next moment of tension or action. The xenomorphs, now a full-scale threat, are terrifying, but Cameron wisely gives us a variety of ways to experience them, from the suspenseful first reveal of the aliens in the reactor room to the pulse-pounding final battle. The action is thrilling, but it's the suspense that keeps the audience on edge. The aliens aren't just killing machines-they're a living nightmare, and the human cost of dealing with them is palpable.Visually, Aliens is stunning. The colonial marines' drop-ship sequence is iconic, as is the use of miniatures, practical effects, and innovative production design. The atmosphere is oppressive, with a distinct industrial, military aesthetic that complements the horror of the alien menace. The Xenomorph Queen, a technological marvel in creature design, is a crowning achievement in monster-movie filmmaking.The score, composed by James Horner, adds layers of intensity to the film's already high tension. His music is both epic and menacing, underscoring the film's action sequences while enhancing its moments of dread. The score's use of heavy percussion and stirring themes brings the story's emotional beats to life.In short, Aliens is a rare sequel that not only builds on the foundations of its predecessor but expands the narrative and the genre in bold, exciting directions. It's a film that mixes adrenaline-pumping action with deeply human stakes, and it remains one of the best examples of how to evolve a franchise while staying true to its roots.Your 8/10 rating suggests that you recognize it as a thrilling, high-quality experience, but perhaps you feel there's something about the slower, more atmospheric tension of Alien that remains unbeaten. Still, Aliens is a classic in its own right, a perfect blend of horror and action."
eugene-sn,"Jan 26, 2022",10/10,"Like the first part, the movie provided work for decades of filmmakers who shot many clones. Great artists, great acting, special effects that have been at their best for over 30 years."
xiaoli7377,"Dec 16, 2022",10/10,"""Aliens"" retains the story, setting, and characters of the original 1979 classic ""Alien"" and discards most of the rest. Gone are the atmosphere, the mundane life aboard a freighting vessel, and the claustrophobia. According to conventional wisdom, abandoning the elements that make a classic so amazing is a terrible idea. But ""Aliens"" is able to crank everything up to eleven and blast open the airlock in terms of crafting a well-rounded sequel. It does what very few sequels attempt to do: don't rehash the original and just ""play it safe."" And it does what very few of what those very few attempts succeed in accomplishing: stand on its own two feet and stand on a pillar alongside its older sibling as one of the pinnacle films of their respective genres (horror and action).Sigourney Weaver is even better in this film as her iconic role, Ripley. I love almost all of the supporting cast, they are all memorable. I especially found Bill Paxton's Hudson hilarious and charming with his one liners.Great action direction from James Cameron; this movie is up there with his two ""Terminator"" films as the perfect mixture of Hitchcock-ian suspense with testosterone induced mania.I would argue that this film, in many aspects, is able perhaps even overshadow its original (at least in terms of having a fun popcorn crowd-pleasing effect on the cultural zeitgeist). Many video games such as ""Doom"" and ""Halo"" take near direct influence from the aesthetic and story beats of this film. You owe it to yourself to watch this movie and just sit back and have fun with it.One word: awesome."
Bumface69,"Nov 24, 2023",N/A,"The heading says it all.It has been my favourite film since it was released, and has stood the test of time.Considering its age I have still yet to watch a film that comes anywhere near it in story, action, and special effects. It is an absolutely masterpiece of cinematic art, and if I were wearing a hat I would take it off to James Cameron and the cast and crew behind it. I need to use up another 200 characters, but I don't think typing ""brilliant"" another 14 times will do it justice. I just wish they would have brought out a 3rd film on par with this. The story in Earth Hive would have been great, but if anyone in Hollywood needs my input as to what a true fan would love to see next, just let me know.For those who haven't seen this film, you need to.For those of a younger generation of when this came out, please appreciate it for what it is. Brilliant."
imdbfan-6000261674,"May 6, 2025",10/10,"James Cameron's historic work in the science fiction/action genre has aged like fine wine and is every bit as awesome now as it was when it came out. This movie has everything: incredible story building on the original sci-fi/horror title in the franchise, tremendously colorful and compelling characters, awesome effects for its era and a villain species that has broken the mold for originality, aesthetic appearance and terror.Above and beyond it all though is Sigourney Weaver's utterly brilliant depiction of Lt. Ellen Ripley...a seminal female hero never to be surpassed with her unassailable combination of intelligence, fortitude, bravery and motherly energy. Ripley is everything you could possibly want and more in a female protagonist and in my opinion there has never been any better created.One of my favourite all time movies for 4 decades and counting; if somehow it has alluded you then you need to stop whatever you're doing now and watch it."
SpaaceMonkee,"Oct 27, 2021",6/10,"Alien was a groundbreaking, incredibly suspenseful thriller in which a small crew of ordinary people, including Ellen Ripley, attempted to survive and escape a terrifying creature. Aliens takes place in the same narrative universe, but involves taking the evil creature from the original film, multiplying it by a hundred or so, and shipping a hero-ified Ripley back to the forbidding planet with a group of space marines, including Bill Paxton playing a scared, rather dim-witted meathead as prone to toss out bad one-liners as he is to fire his rifle.In short, if you wish Alien had more, well, aliens, and way more explosions and gun battles, then Aliens is the film for you. It's an over-the-top action extravaganza. The movie starts veering into ridiculous territory as it approaches the conclusion, then it really cranks it up. It's preposterous, but it has a high ""cool factor."" After all, have you ever seen a front loader do karate before?"
kcrateau,"Jun 14, 2022",10/10,"I have watched this movie probably 50 times. No joking. The plot, the pacing, the effects, are better than any movie I've ever seen. John Carpenter definitely did this one right!!!!"
ZCDomingos,"May 16, 2021",10/10,"If only all sequels were like this! Really, only James Cameron could make movie history after Ridley Scott!Phenomenal in every way of the word! Admired as a kid and still amazes me in 2021. I loved rewatching this masterpiece of a sequel.It's everything anyone can expect from James Cameron and so much more. It's a good example for filmmaking and in 2021 it still is a masterpiece!Amazing how in 2021 we still see so many mediocre films, sequels, reboots, and remakes only for more money, like screw the material. It's not like no one wants more money, but make it meaningful, not just a cashgrab and specially don't tarnish the brand only for a couples of bucks. That's just unfair and ungrateful of Hollywood (but something we already expect from it, unfortunately).Once again, this is a movie that will always be a pleasure to watch again and again!"
faramirjcb,"Dec 3, 2021",9/10,Watching Aliens I almost forget this was 1986. The special effects still looked great. As good as Alien. Alien was a little more creepy while Aliens has more action. Disney Plus has it and I think it must be the extended version because there were scenes I didn't remember. The extra scenes add even more to the feel of the movie. Get a bit of background on the company and the settlers on the original alien seeded planet.
wtsttx,"Aug 27, 2024",10/10,"Terrific film: the pace builds slowly but relentlessly culminating in a series of heart stopping scenesEssentially a war film set in space we follow a troop of soldiers and a couple of civilians investigating why a colony of settlers have suddenly stopped communicating- needless to say the reason is not anything pleasant.Additionally, there is an entire cast of memorable characters but none more so than the redoubtable Ellen Ripley; a heroine for the ages.Of course the real stars of the film are the xenomorph aliens who surely take their place near the pinnacle in the pantheon of great ( and terrifying) monsters of cinema.Aliens is not only the greatest sci fi film of the 80s it is one of the best full stop."
Edge49,"Aug 29, 2023",8/10,"We know, sequels usually aren't as great as the first and most of them are just down right lame. Off the top of my head T2 was the only great sequel I can think of. This one did not disappoint!I loved the premise how she was found and her role in this movie. I loved the continuity of it all. The suspense was on par or even better than the first. The action was all top notch. Just some good ole hardcore 80's action. Gotta love it.It was pretty long though. I think a little shy of 3hrs but it did not feel like it. Also the ending was kind of similar to how the first one was but that's ok.I thought the franchise would have peaked with the first one but I was wrong. I hope this third one is great too!"
TheBigSick,"Sep 12, 2017",N/A,"James Cameron is just a born genius in filmmaking, who always improves the sequel over the original film. ""Terminator 2"" is better than ""The Terminator"", and here ""Aliens"" exceeds ""Alien"". So there are reasons to expect that ""Avatar 2"" is upgraded from ""Avatar"".First of all, the visual effects are improved in ""Aliens"". In ""Alien"", due to the technology limits, only part of the alien is shown to the audience. But here in ""Aliens"", a full-sized alien is filmed. Secondly, the emotion of ""Aliens"" is stronger than that in ""Alien"" because of the new character Newt."
aciessi,"Dec 8, 2020",9/10,"When it comes to sequels that are just as good as the first, the gold standard is The Godfather: Part II. But Aliens, I think, should be looked at in the same regard. It's one of the rare sequels that keeps what made the first film great and only expands upon it, while also switching franchises all together. Alien is a haunted house horror movie. Aliens is a sci-fi action movie helmed by the master of the genre, James Cameron. It's a complete change of tone and you know what? It rocks. Ridley and Co. are badass. The screenplay is also sharper and yes, funnier. Bill Paxton for the win."
johnnyboyz,"Apr 30, 2019",7/10,"There is a moment about half way through James Cameron's ""Aliens"" which seems to very deliberately turn back to its 1979 predecessor and say 'yeah, I see your effort, and I raise you'. It occurs when a bevy of soldiers are trooping through the remains of a settlement on a desolate moon: it has been ransacked by a series of violent creatures whose sole purpose is to seemingly seek organisms and attack them. As they march through the crime scene, we realise that they are essentially traversing an area which has seen events play out that were very similar to the first film: a group of (largely) unarmed people trying to defend themselves from these animals in a zone they cannot escape. ""Aliens"", however, is just getting out of second gear by this point...Cameron's film somehow manages to go bigger and, dare I say it, a bit better than ""Alien"" - marrying the genres of action; horror and science-fiction to excellent effect. Indeed, like the best of anything science-fiction has to offer, you get the feeling you are in another world - a world of superior artificial intelligence, of space vehicles designed for things we are still a long way from pioneering ourselves and of distant worlds.The terror Cameron seems able to inject into proceedings stems, I think, from knowing there are multiple enemies; indeed, an endless supply, about whom we know very little but always seem to be conniving to get you one way or another. One would think lots of these creatures dumped into a film alongside a group of gun-toting protagonists would make for a disaster after the menacing calm of the first film - perhaps I once thought that myself, but having seen the film again recently, I'm of the opinion that Cameron executes the material really well.""Aliens"" begins with a military-style drum roll over the opening credits, briefly foreshadowing the militaristic content this edition will possess. We pick up, quite literally, where the first film ended: the lone human survivor of the transport ship Nostromo, Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), is drifting through space in an escape capsule. When she is found, a rare and amusing moment occurs: an outside agent, totally unaware of what they have stumbled upon, crack open the door and send in a probe to make sure it's safe - they are afraid of what we know is perfectly fine, and yet we as an audience are unsure of what has found our heroine and so are oddly uneasy as well.When Ripley comes around, the film allows us to share in her shock at the fact some 57 years have passed since the events of the first film. She has lost a daughter who has outlived her and, gut-wrenchingly, entire families have since settled on the moon the initial alien's biological origins were discovered. Her only friend amidst a sea of disapproving bureaucrats, unsympathetic to her story, is a smooth-talking company employee named Burke (Paul Riser), whose pleasant manner makes certain later reveals all that more surprising...Burke wants Ripley to traverse to the moon when, inexplicably, communications with the settlement suddenly cease, only he wants her to accompany a platoon of marines, as she has first-hand experience of the creature and nobody can take any chances... What Cameron does impressively here is he allows for the opening act to calmly break us into this sequel, which is at once both very similar to ""Alien"" but very different: loose ends are tied up, Ripley becomes grounded again; we sneak a glimpse of mugshots of the first crew on a monitor; she accepts her daughter's death and even reconciles with the cat of the first film.Once Cameron senses we are ready to roll, act two arrives, and the film begins to play games: the marines themselves strike us as unprofessional in their messing around and cracking crude jokes. They are not especially well-drilled - one of them even seems to echo the dialogue of the doomed crew of the first when they speak about not being paid enough; the commander confuses two marines, Hudson (Michael Biehn) and Hicks (Bill Paxton), and we are afforded a shot of Ripley looking on in horror at her escorts.When the time comes, of course the film breaks out into action - armed soldiers versus a nest of beasts when it's discovered a process similar to what befell John Hurt in ""Alien"" occurred to an unwitting inhabitant of the colony. But, without question, the film is more than merely two hours of blazing guns and wretched shootouts - there is variety to the set pieces and they're executed really well: pulsating gunfights in rooms drowned in red light give way to retreats into ventilation shafts; there is a dramatic confrontation in the cargo bay of a giant spaceship, which refuses to end when it spills into the airlock. Midway through, Ripley is trapped in a small bunkroom with a crawling specimen eager to attach itself to her face where every little rattle and clank is unnerving. What additionally struck me was just how difficult it was to predict who was safe and who wasn't.Moreover, the film is a poised character study of Ripley negating this new nightmare with an infant girl called Newt (Carrie Henn), orphaned by the monsters, and allowing Weaver's character a kind of second chance at good mothering. She may have failed to live up to the promise she made to the daughter we find out about, but damned if she's going to fail to get Newt out of this jam. The arc is eventually afforded closure as Ripley and an alien queen, responsible for the eggs from which the aliens essentially harbour their existences, confront one another and we remember it was one of the queen's own offspring which ultimately took Ripley's time with her own little girl away from her. ""Aliens"" is a taut, well-made sequel and well worth seeing."
paulinebracq,"Oct 14, 2019",4/10,"In my humble opinion this is the most boring and unimpressive movie out of the 4 main;
I think the plot is far better than the super lackluster number 4 but I have to rate this last higher as at least there is personality and ideas in the way it's shoot anc acted.
Alien 2 is ""just"" an action movie with big explosions, and very cliché and dull characters."
joberfeld113,"Aug 28, 2015",10/10,"Everyone says that sequels have a tendency to suck. Then there are the sequels that do not improve upon the original, but are still good movies on their own. Then there is Aliens. A sequel that is not like other sequels. Aliens is one of those sequels that is either as good as or better than the original. The film continues Ripley's story arc at exactly where the first one left off. Ripley has been floating around in stasis for 57 years. When she returns home, her employer, the Weyland-Yutani Corporation, asks her what happened. Ripley tells them the entire story which none of them believe. She is also suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. Ripley is told that there are now colonists on the planet LV-426 which is the crew she served with found the ship from the first film. Burke, a high level representative from the company, tells Ripley that communication with the colony has stopped and convinces her to return there with marines and be an adviser. Unfortunately when they get there, the colony is destroyed and the colonists are nowhere to be found except for one survivor, a little girl named Newt. They find out that the colonists did discover the ship and everything that happened on the Nostromo is now repeating itself in the colony. This sequel was directed by Terminator director James Cameron, not Ridley Scott. But it still does not matter as Aliens has a lot of what made the first film great. H.R. Giger's designs from the first film are improved upon. That goes more than double with one of the aliens late in the film. The marines in this movie are armed with state of the weapons that can easily kill, but the film keeps all of the tension by having them completely outnumbered and at a disadvantage with them not knowing what they are up against, despite Ripley telling them earlier in the film. While there are the dumb marines, Hicks, Vasquez, and Hudson either leave a lasting impression or remain quotable. Newt is not your typical kid character. Most kid characters in films get annoying, however Newt is a lot fun to watch. She is also smart and realizes that the best way to survive against the aliens is to run. The acting in the film is also impressive. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley and owns the role so much that it is likely the best performance she has ever given. Hicks, Hudson, and an android named Bishop are all played by Cameron film regulars Michael Biehn, Bill Paxton, and Lance Henriksen. All three of them suit their roles very well. Aliens is another one of those movies that ages so well over time. It probably gets better and better with each viewing. While Alien perfected slow-building, atmospheric tension, Aliens packs more of a punch, and features what I think is Sigourney Weaver's best performance."

kosmasp,"May 19, 2020",9/10,"Well many would strongly disagree. But this is not about the quality of this sequel (some even suggesting this being superior than the first movie, that's not my decision to make), it is about one of the characters spewing many memorable quote. Bill Paxton has done a lot of movies and he has shown his skills in many roles. This may be the favorite for some, but he is not alone.And the Alien is also not alone (see what I did there?). That's another reason this sequel is named Aliens (as in more than one). Now apparently Weaver came back to this franchise having some thoughts of her own. None of which where implemented by Cameron, but were later taken not just under consideration but made into ""reality"".But back to this, that has a lot of Aliens and a lot of weapons. Weaver herself is anti gun, but as Cameron stated, it is not Weaver shooting, it is Ripley, her character. So this is way more action packed and it also continues the story of the first movie. Effects are great, cast is amazing, some communication devices have dated though. Also a nice spin on the android-phobia from the first movie throughout the movie. Really well thought out and well made, one of the best sequels to an arguable classic"

heisenberg12,"Feb 8, 2019",6/10,"Aliens is an excellent action-packed, sci-fi movie with standout performances by Sigourney Weaver, Michael Biene, and Lance Hendrickson, as well as a solid supporting cast of marines, most notably Bill Paxton.Cameron does an excellent job directing, as all three acts are perfectly constructed. Once the action gets going, it rarely lets up and will keep you on the edge of your seat. The aliens are so creepy and scary, and the movie has lots of horror elements. Some great scenes are maximized by stylish camera work and slow motion that really make it stand out.All in all, it's a great sci-fi movie, but a little bit of 80s cheesiness and a couple of parts that were a little bit dumb in the middle made it have a couple of flaws, which is the reduction in score. I still think part I is better, but this is well worth the watch, and for a sequel it is definitely up there among the best.8/10"

someokiedude,"Feb 14, 2021",8/10,"In 1979, a young James Cameron, along with many other moviegoers, film lovers, and science fiction and horror fans were transfixed by a unique and revolutionary film that would come to define the science fiction horror sub-genre: Ridley Scott's Alien. Like many, he would be in awe of just how Ridley Scott and crew managed to make a film that felt so fresh, so reinvigorating, and so original. I know that I, as well as anyone would be terrified in taking this on, but somehow Cameron makes a film that has the same feel of Alien, but also distinguishes itself from Alien at the same time.A sequel to one of the greatest science fiction horror films of all time sounded odd to most people, with Cameron himself later admitting that even he initially didn't want to see a sequel for Alien, or to make one for that matter. Yet somehow, inexplicably, Cameron would go on to make what many people consider to be a film that's as good, if not even better than the original (which I contest, but I'll get to that as I go along).Aliens is a slightly different beast from the original film, Ebert would go on to call Aliens a roller coaster ride of intensity, rather than its more quieter, subtler predecessor. I wouldn't be surprised if Cameron took a note from John Carpenter in how to combine theatrical intensity and genuine suspense. Much like with the original Alien, Cameron never allows you an out when dealing with these creatures, either you're all in or you're completely out. But it's not afraid to be fun either, it's certainly a film that knows what it is, and it has no fear in being fun and awesome while also being suspenseful and tense. It's a feat that few directors can pull off, and Cameron manages to do so with finesse for the most part.On the other hand, I was quite surprised by the sensitivity and intelligence that this film was sometimes able to demonstrate, particularly with its characters. Not unlike Alien, much of the best conflicts that are in this film comes from the characters, their personalities and motivations, and the film is careful not to over indulge in the action to the point where one may get annoyed and demand to get to the aliens already, not unlike Alien, it allows you to invest in these characters and their lives, makes you cheer for them and fear for them and hope that they all get out alright, it is this that I think sets Aliens above other action films of its type.Weaver is excellent in this film, and is clearly the strongest part of it. Much like with Alien, she brings a level headedness to the role, she's the only one who's willing to act against all other circumstances, she's smart, can think on her feet, she's the only one who can be calm and think clearly in a high pressure situation. Much like with the first Alien movie, her change from a completely traumatized wreck of a woman into a hard boiled badass, but also isn't afraid to show a sensitive side to herself, such as with her connection to Newt. The rest of the cast are also stellar, with some of them going on to become noted character actors like Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, and Michael Biehn.But is it better than the original film, as some say? Some say yes, but I give a firm no. While it can't be denied that Aliens is well written, directed, and acted, with great action and suspense, I found that the film was missing the psychology and subtlety that made the original Alien such an engrossing and lasting feature. It made the Xenomorph less of a frightening, unstoppable force, more than another movie monster to shoot and kill. Certainly, it was still menacing and threatening, but it wasn't quite as suspenseful, not quite as disturbing, it was more cliched and predictable, more Hollywood to put it frankly. I would expect Cameron, who has a notorious reputation for being a stingey perfectionist to understand this, but I was disappointed that he didn't seem to fully comprehend it.But Britton, one may say, there's the quiet moments of suspense in the film, surely you can't ignore those moments. There were, there's no denying it, I felt like it was having too much fun with itself, too in love with the spectacle of the action and theatrics, rather than any lingering suspense or tension. As previously said, I found that Aliens had slightly missed the quiet intensity and subtle psychological horror that made the first film so endlessly engrossing and fascinating, and it's something that I continually struggle to forgive.Despite its flaws however, Aliens proves to be a worthy successor to the original, even if there were aspects of it that I find were lacking. It is certainly better written, directed, and acted than many of its contemporaries, and even more so than many films of its type today. If you asked me which order you should see the Alien films, I'd recommend the first one and this one, and then leave out all the rest."
Spenser,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"Bar none, the best movie of its kind, and one of the few sequels ever made that actually eclipses its predecessor (Alien) in quality, action, and storyline.  Alien was a very good movie, and Aliens improves upon it, making for an excellent double-feature!Aliens is the measure by which all other movies in its genre are judged, and many years after its release, it still reigns as the definitive example of its kind.A must-see for any sci-fi, horror, or action movie fan!"
itsrabbi,"Jul 28, 2023",8/10,"Aliens (1986): An exceptional science fiction film that still captivates viewers with its thrilling action and profound ideas. James Cameron demonstrates his skill as a director by effortlessly combining fright, tension, and intense fighting scenes. Sigourney Weaver gives an outstanding portrayal as Ellen Ripley, a strong and determined main character. The movie's amazing special effects, combined with its famous heart-racing soundtrack, produce a fully engaging and memorable encounter. Aliens not just pushes the limits of the category but also examines human feelings and connections amidst encounters with beings from another world. Although some portions might seem a bit old-fashioned, overall, it is still an essential and timeless movie to watch."
safods,"Jan 14, 2022",9/10,"Saw this as a kid and enjoyed it for the action and the gung ho marines. As an adult I realised how insanely well written this action movie is. Every character brings something to the table and have their moments in the movie which means I care for them, some I root for, some I hope end up on the Alien menu(looking at you Burke).But I'm involved in their fate and journey through the movie. The Ripley character goes from reluctant to involved to taking charge, all done without being obnoxious or condescending. Talk about strong female character. Yes ma'am. It's all done without relegating the male characters (Hicks, Hudson, Bishop, etc) which in turn only elevates Ripley's awesomness. In short, a great well written script makes this a classic 80's action movie and rewatchable."
insectus,"Apr 2, 2001",6/10,"Yes, indeed a miracle. This is one of the few movies that follows up and changes the formula of an excellent film and doesn't loose anything at all in quality, relative to its genre. In a very clever way, this movie transports the universe from the sci-fi epic ""alien"" into an action movie that is probably the best of its type. James Cameron shows great talent while directing this film, always keeping connections to the Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" so that the idea of sequel isn't broken despite the great difference between the films. The acting is good, and excellent in the case of Sigourney Weaver (however, how polemic this may sound, I think she's even better in Alien 3). The plot is very simple like in the first movie, but as the few twists come it becomes quite convencing. The special effects are quite good for its time showing a clear improvement from the first movie. The alien queen is quite impressing. The action sequences are memorable and have inspired many ""imitations"" in other movies and even in some video games. This film only receives a worst score than the first because if we put aside the different genres, the movie itself is quite worst than the first, it is in the action genre that it is great."
stimpy_tr,"Nov 18, 2021",10/10,"This is the second movie of the legendary Alien series. The movie weighs more on the action side rather than suspense as in the first movie. It was a very clever move as the expectations were high. The cast is enlarged with interesting characters and Sigourney Weaver keeps the lead role as usual. The movie involves a lot of stunning action sequences with different kinds of horrific creatures, all taken without the use of CGI.It has numerous unforgettable scenes such as the fabulous knife trick of Bishop, huge Alien Queen laying eggs and Bishop getting ripped in half. When we were children, the day after seeing the movie, we used to imitate the knife trick with pencils at school.The movie is still mind-blowing 35 years later. After all those years, I watched it with the same excitement. Due to its engrossing story and breathtaking action scenes, this movie has become one of the greatest sci-fi movies of all time."
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 9, 2006",7/10,"Most people have probably heard how the second one continues the story but takes a little bit different direction: the first one was a horror movie and the second one was more of an action flick. Well, you'd better believe that they go all out. The story picks up fifty-seven years after the original, and sure enough, there are more aliens. Ellen Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), however, is not to be deterred. If those drooling fiends are around, she's ready to take them on.I should say that the movie seems a little silly at times. Since this is an action flick, there are a number of army types, and they all have their macho lingo. Fortunately, ""Aliens"" doesn't pretend to be anything but an action flick. If anything, the little girl adds a sort of humanizing aspect to the kick-ass stuff. But this is definitely a guy movie, albeit one carried by a woman. If I may say so, Weaver becomes as much of a bad-ass here as she was in ""Ghost Busters"" (of course, this time she's not possessed).Anyway, this movie has something for everyone, and you're sure to like it. Really cool. Also starring Lance Henriksen, Bill Paxton and Paul Reiser.I wonder whatever became of Carrie Henn."
reverse_hsalf,"Aug 14, 2001",5/10,"In my opinion Aliens is everything that is wrong with movies. The director uses cheap replacements for essential movie parts, Darkness for Atmosphere, Action for plot and language for aggresion. Anyone could have made this movie and in my opinion this particular director has. Terminator, T2 even Titanic ended in a chase, water chasing the good guys. All the other Alien movies have a redeeming plot but this is just machismo shots for adrenaline junkies. In my opinion but who am I."
jerryhollando,"Dec 2, 2025",10/10,"OK so maybe my review title might be biased. But this action movie has everything you could want! Action! Suspense! Horror! Aliens! Great story! Badass heroines and heroes!I suspect most people that are reading this review have watched this movie by now, but if you haven't, what are you waiting for?!?!?It doesn't get any better than this."
warrenbarnes,"Nov 9, 2021",10/10,I've seen hundreds of movies maybe thousands and non have come close to aliens except alien and even that is not as excellent as this. Sigourney weaver is a power house bad ass and puts the men to shame and for 1986 it was unheard of in movies. James Cameron direction is perfect so if you've never seen alien then please watch my favourite movie of all time.
benxrichardson,"Jan 26, 2022",9/10,"As an action movie sequel, Aliens is absolutely top notch. Ripley becomes a character we truly care about. The action and special effects are brilliant for their time and the set design is perfect.The suspense created in Aliens will keep you riveted to your seat."
yearspew,"Jun 21, 2008",9/10,"James Cameron's Aliens is one of the best sequels ever made. Being a sequel to the brilliant Alien is not easy, yet this movie manages to hold its own and create its own atmosphere and tone. And succeeding at it.What impresses me is that the Alien universe allowed a fantastic suspense/horror first film as well as a fantastic action sequel.The fact that it's an action movie does not bother me. It wasn't trying to imitate the original or to be a suspense movie. It was trying to be a more accessible shoot-em-up movie loaded with guns, explosions and humor and I think James Cameron did an amazing job with the script and the direction.The characters are well-written. You know they're disposable, yet they have each one a different charm that I really like in ensemble casts. Bill Paxton being particularly funny as Pvt. Hudson.Sigourney Weaver and Michael Biehn are great together as Ripley and Hicks respectively. The chemistry was good and it allowed the characters to have some valuable interaction without distracting from the action.The aliens were cool-looking and they make some great villains. They are not scary like the creature in Alien was, and they are killed like bugs by the marines, but still, they fit as well in an action movie as they did in a suspense/horror one."
the_ghostman0,"Mar 16, 2008",10/10,"Of all the sci-fi films I've seen, this is undoubtedly the BEST sci-fi action film out there. With a mix of suspense, action, humor, love, horror....this film tops them all. Although it is an old film with low graphics compared to today's standards, it still is awesome and completely believable. Hollywood needs to know that sometimes, CGI doesn't make monsters look better, let alone action. The most important aspect of this film is its dynamic storyline. It starts out with a futuristic world, then comes down to the dark and gloomy techy hallways of doom with which the Aliens lurk. Nothing tops that! I'm pretty sure the rating for this film says it all and there's no other way to get you to know how good it is unless you watch it. I so wish that Hollywood would make another film like this one.....:("
philip_vanderveken,"Apr 10, 2005",7/10,"You have to know about me that I'm a big movie buff, but that I'm not a fan of most Sci-Fi movies. It's just not my kind of movie. Most of the time they just aren't good enough and aren't able to make me believe the story. But the Alien-movies are something different. Somehow they are able to get my attention and to keep me focused from the beginning until the end.Aliens is the second movie in the series and the story starts half a century later. Ripley, the only survivor from the previous movie, has been found by a salvage ship, adrift in the shuttle she used to escape, in a deep sleep. She's taken back to Earth, where she hears that a colony was established on the planet where the Alien once was found. But since a while, all contact with the planet has been lost and a rescue mission, coordinated by the Space Marines, will be sent to see what has happened. Ripley is asked to join them as their 'advisor' and so she will meet her biggest fear ... again.Even though it is still my opinion that sequels should be forbidden, since most of them are only intended to get even more money out of the pockets of the fans, I'll have to review my opinion for once. This movie certainly isn't as bad as most sequels are. It's still full of action, the acting is good and let's be honest, a Sci-Fi movie that doesn't look dated after 20 years time is something special. That's why I give this one a 7/10. Certainly worth a watch"
pmedeirosapc,"Dec 6, 2021",9/10,"Aliens (1986) Theatrical Cut ReviewAfter viewing the Aliens theatrical cut tonight, I became aware that I had not seen the theatrical cut since the special edition was released in 1991. The more I think about it, I may have never seen the actual theatrical cut. The first time I saw Aliens was during the television premiere broadcast on CBS in 1989, and even this version had additional scenes including the scene where Ripley discovers that she has outlived her daughter. There's a slight chance that I may have seen the theatrical version when it was shown on HBO, but I have no specific memory of that. I've even owned both versions for many years in my Legacy, Quadrilogy, and Anthology box sets, but always opted to watch the special edition.So, after finally seeing the original 1986 theatrical cut of Aliens, beautifully scanned and transferred in the Anthology set, it is a far better version of the film. This may go against popular opinion, but I now realize that nearly everything that I disliked about Aliens came from Cameron's special edition.First, on a technical level, the theatrical version is more tightly edited by Ray Lovejoy. Without the unnecessary special edition scenes which drags the film down, the pacing is quicker, intensifying both the action and the suspenseful scenes.Stylistically, the theatrical version is closer to the original Alien (1979). Again, without the extraneous scenes, the film is more visceral and mysterious, providing better continuity between the two films.Perhaps the biggest difference between the two versions is the addition of the scenes and dialog involving the fact that Ripley had a daughter and that she outlived her during her long hyper sleep. I understand that this might give more depth to her character and a more emotional connection to Newt, emphasizing Ripley's motherly bond, but again it was unnecessary.In fact, I've always questioned the entire idea of Ripley as a mother. First of all, Ripley is quite young in the first Alien film. It seems unlikely that a young warrant officer on a commercial towing starship would be a mother. These voyages into deep space would be long and arduous which would match better with a more detached lifestyle.Thus, the childless Ripley of the theatrical version of Aliens is more in line with the Ripley of Alien. Does not having a daughter take away from the motherly nature of Ripley after finding and caring for Newt? Not at all. On the contrary, it allows for her character to grow into a mother, which I find more positive and endearing. The familial nucleus of Ripley, Newt, and Hicks becomes more refreshing without the unnecessary angst created by the special edition.I won't go into other scenes that were added to the special edition in great detail, but while they make for some interesting visuals, they also feel contrived and forced. It just so happens that it's Newt's family seen entering the derelict spacecraft. Do we really need to see that? We can infer that something like that happened when we see the devastation in the colony. By not knowing what happened exactly, this creates more mystery. Also, Ripley confronts Burke regarding his directive to send colonists into the derelict. So again, seeing it visually doesn't add anything to the story.In the final analysis, most of the added scenes and dialog from the special edition are examples of bad writing. I always felt James Cameron's writing is quite infantile, so the theatrical cut greatly improves the film by eliminating the bad and unnecessary scenes and dialog. This is a great example where less is more. The first two films now go together much better and I can finally feel satisfied. For me, I'll just ignore the special edition and treat the additional scenes as just interesting bonus material. The theatrical cut is my preferred version of Aliens."
Gunnar_Runar_Ingibjargarson,"Jun 17, 2008",7/10,"Aliens is one of the few cases of a sequel that far surpassed the original. Sigourney Weaver returns as Ripley, who awakens on Earth only to discover that she has been hibernating in space so long that everyone she knows is dead. Then she is talked into traveling (along with a squad of Marines) to a planet under assault by the same aliens that nearly killed her. Once she gets there, she finds a lost little girl who triggers her maternal instincts--and she discovers that the company has once again double-crossed her, in hopes of capturing one of the aliens to study as a military weapon. Directed and written by James Cameron, this is one of the most intensely exciting (not to mention intensely frightening) action films ever, with a large ensemble cast that includes Bill Paxton, Lance Henriksen, Paul Reiser, and Michael Biehn. Weaver defined the action woman in this film and walked away with an Oscar nomination for her trouble."
DistrictSix,"Sep 25, 2002",4/10,"Such a shame that this movie is lauded so greatly. The original movie has atmosphere where this has darkness. The original movie has suspense where this has fast camera action. The oriinal movie had a plot where this movie had an excuse. People saying this movie is the best in the series are clearly deluded. Adrenaline in movies is the reason such travesties as ""the fast and the furious"" or ""xXx"" get made. This is simply taking a fantastic actone and crapping all over over it from outer space. Well it's the only way to be sure it's going to make money. Movie for the braindead that need guns and attitude to enjoy a couple of hours.You like this movie why not rent Terminator 2 or Titanic and watch it again."
neisesjason,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,Siqourney Weaver at the peak of her acting career. Its very rare to see a sequel surpass all expectations. The movie does a great job at making you feel the tension at critical moments. They also manage to advance the plot in a good direction that makes sense.possibly the best sequel ever made.
owenpont-70803,"Dec 30, 2021",10/10,This film is awesome. In every possible way this is a SCI-FI epic for the ages. Everything from the plot that continues the franchise perfectly. The new characters who are the most memorable characters in the franchise and the old characters who get more development and its all for the better. The aliens are cooler and the final battle is the best part of the film. Also the quotes are so memorable.
julie-james80,"May 25, 2008",10/10,"Aliens is a great example of a decent film, it ranks high as a sequel and definitely is the best one sofar. The whole thing with James Cameron is he loves to over exaggerate which is why this is such a good movie.Its not often you get a good 2nd movie although there are some great underrated examples: Rocky 2, terminator 2, Rambo 2 and this just has to be included as its a fist gripping action movie, beans role in this film is far by the best and i highly recommend you buy this movie, another 10/10 from here! Alien World meets earth! I hope you found this review useful. Because IMDb demands at least 10 sentances and i question why!"
gnperuti,"Jul 12, 2025",10/10,"Taking the original, which was a claustrophobic, slow paced monster movie in space and following it with a sequel that's more action oriented may seem like a weird choice. But credit where it's due, this film not only delivers, but blows expectations out of the water. Like the first movie, it does take a while to get to the actual aliens (more if you're watching the extended cut). However, thanks to the fantastic set up, payoffs from the first film, and great cast, it's never boring. Plus, once the action starts, it's pretty much nonstop, while never sacrificing the confined horror of the first. In fact, some of the scenes here are even scarier than anything in the first.Five years before Sarah Conner did a much welcome complete 180 in Terminator 2, we get to see Ripley go through a similar arc, that of a survivor traumatized by the horrors she witnessed forced into action and along the way becoming one of the coolest female characters ever. The writing and Sigourney Weaver's performance that earned her a well deserved Oscar nomination come together to create a pitch perfect heroine. That, plus the bond she develops with Newt, a delightful character who proves that pairing an action star with a kid isn't always a recipe for disaster, especially when they work so well off each other. The rest of the cast is spectacular, too, with Bill Paxton and Jenette Goldstein especially standing out.While some of the effects and directing choices in the first film haven't aged well, the ones in this have aged like fine wine. After cutting his teeth on The Terminator, James Cameron got to hone his craft here while upping the ante from the first. After seeing the horror one alien wrought, the idea of an army of them is terrifying, and the film takes full advantage of this, showing them mercilessly swarm the heroes and be an incredible nuisance to kill. Then there's the alien Queen, one of the most frightening creatures ever put to film who takes full advantage of her limited screen time. The action is fast paced, chaotic, and loaded with cool weapons and kills. And the sets and music are even more impressive than before.Overall, Aliens is right up there with some of the best sequels ever, not just in the sci-fi genre, but in general. It tops the already excellent first, and is the only film in the series so far I'd give a perfect score. The less said about its immediate sequels the better."
ahifi,"Dec 12, 2009",9/10,"Aliens is a classic. Even 23 years after its release and multiple watches later, it still captures my attention when channel flicking. Everything in the movie is top-notch and I mean EVERYTHING. Acting, script, plot, story, direction, editing, sound, props...you name it, it does it to such a high quality.Ripley returns and proves that she truly is one of cinema's most iconic characters; a kick-ass female who's more in-tune with her feminine side than Sarah Connor, but no less dangerous. She's joined by the likes of the hardened but amiable Hicks (Michael Biehn), Bishop (played by the fantastic Lance Henriksen) and many other memorable characters.Aliens is pretty much the highest quality action/sci-fi movie out there, even all the way down to the subtext. It surpassed its sequel, but at the same time it's a different beast to its predecessor. It has yet to be beaten in its class and rightfully so. 10/10"
