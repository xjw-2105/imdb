mark-lovellsamuels,"Jul 27, 2009",10/10,"No matter how many times one sits through this Hitchcock classic, Anthony Perkins always manages to surprise you. It is a sensational performance - for which he didn't even get an Oscar nomination - I have no way of knowing how much preparation he dedicated to the creation of Norman Bates, maybe no more than usual, but the details of his performance are astonishing. Never a false move and if you follow the film looking into his eyes, you'll be amazed as I was. The madness and the tenderness, the danger and the cravings. A mamma's boy with hellish implications and yet we see, we feel connected to the human being, we are not horrified by him but of his circumstances. In short, we kind of understand him. That alone puts him miles and miles away from other cinematic monsters. From Richard Attenborough as the real life Christie in ""10 Rillington Place"" to the hideous, unredeemable Christian Bale in ""American Psycho"". Here Hitchcock and Herrman create an universe that Anthony Perkins inhabits with the same kind of electricity, nerve and shyness that Norman Bates projects throughout the film. Janet Leigh falls for it if not him. She, like us, sees the boy trying to escape his dutiful son's trap. He is in my list of the 10 most riveting characters ever to be captured on film."
arichmondfwc,"May 19, 2017",10/10,"Getting into Hitchcock's Psycho, 57 years after its original release is like assisting to a masterclass of sorts. We can now identify what made this little lurid tale into a classic. Hitchcock himself, naturally, but now we know the first director's cut was a major disappointment and that Alma Reville - Hitch's wife - took over, re edited and the results have been praised, applauded and studied ever since. Janet Leigh's Marion Crane created a movie landmark with her shower scene. Bernard Herrmann and his strings created an extra character that we recognize as soon as it reappears under any disguise but, what shook me the most now in 2017 is Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates. His performance has evolved with the passing of time and its effect has remain as chilling, as moving, as funny and as real as it was in 1960. It's interesting to watch Gus Van Sant's 1998 version with Vince Vaugh as Norman Bates. If you look at the film, shot by shot with Berrnard Herrmann's strings - it's pretty fantastic. - Play it in black and white if you can. The problem and it is a monumental problem, we wait for Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, if the casting of Anne Heche was really bad - not a hint of Janet Leigh's humanity, the casting of Vince Vaughn was incomprehensible. Not just not credible for a moment but annoying, very annoying. Anthony Perkins brought something profoundly personal to Norman Bates and as a consequence we connected with his sickness. We felt for him. Okay, sorry, I didn't mean to go there but I felt compelled to because I saw again Psycho (1960) ad Psycho (1998) at 24 hours from each other and realized that the main flaw of the 1998 versions is the absence of Anthony Perkins."
Xstal,"Mar 31, 2024",8/10,"An opportunity presents that can't be ignored, to escape from a world that's been making you bored, with dollars galore you ride out of town, pestered by a copper, who keeps hanging around; you seek to find shelter, somewhere to hide, the motel of Bates is the one that you've spied, there's a curious fella who's friendly, polite, you pay for your stay, and wish him goodnight; after taking the key you retire to room, then into the bath for a showery flume, but before you're all clean you get into a lather, as the curtain is shred, by a psychotic slasher.Still a wonderful piece of filmmaking all these years later."
AlsExGal,"Mar 25, 2017",10/10,"...from the first time I saw it at age 14 until today whenever I run across it.This is the rare example of a much-ballyhooed film that is truly deserving of all the hype surrounding it. It would have been nice to have experienced the film without any knowledge of the plot twists. Unfortunately, for most viewers, the big surprises are not possible since so many of the scenes are part of our popular culture.There were, however, so many unexpected surprises.The opening scene with Janet Leigh and John Gavin in the hotel room was amazing and (pardon the cliché) so real. Hitchcock and Janet Leigh did a brilliant job of pulling us into Marion Crane's story, that of a woman in love with a divorced man who might as well be married considering his heavy financial obligations that leave him unable to marry in a practical sense even though he can in a legal sense. He doesn't even have a proper home - just a room in the back of the store he owns.Marion is then seemingly set up as the center of the movie as she thinks she has found a solution to her problems - a felonious one. Then the focus is skillfully shifted to the Norman Bates character as the ""protagonist"" victimized by his insane mother (or so it seemed) and then the focus is shifted once again to Marion's sister's search.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.This film is mentioned in the documentary ""Moguls and Movie Stars"" as an example of how films were becoming more like TV as the 60s began - spartan art design and a script that was bold in the amount of sex and violence it had, even if the vast majority is implied. You have to be impressed by the versatility that is Hitchcock. Making movies in England? No problem. Making movies in the American studio system? No problem. Modernizing to deal with the evaporation of the production code? Again, no problem.Weird factoid - for you TCM fans out there Robert Osborne is credited as ""man"" in Psycho, although I don't remember him ever mentioning it. The only person it could possibly be unless he never comes close to having his face on camera is the parson as the sheriff and his wife are exiting church. See what you think."
littlemartinarocena,"Nov 23, 2007",10/10,"Robert Bloch wrote the original work, Joseph Stefano adapted it into a tight screenplay but it was Alfred Hitchcock with the extraordinary complicity of Bernard Herrmann who transformed this lurid tale into a classic, horror masterpiece. The score propels us into the moment before the moment arrives provoking the sort of anticipation that verges on the unbearable. The fact that the key scenes have become iconic film moments: copied, imitated, emulated and parodied, have not diminished its impact, not really. The anticipation, underlined by Herrmann's strings, creates a sort of craving for the moment to arrive. That doesn't happen very often. No amount of planning can produce it or re-produce it - otherwise how do you explain the Gus Van Sant version - so, the only possible explanation is an accident, a miraculous film accident and those do happen. Everything falls into place so perfectly that even the things that one may argue are below the smart standard of the film, are needed, the film without every frame is not quite the film. Try to turn away after the climax during Simon Oakland's long explanation. You can't. I couldn't. Partly because you know you'll soon be confronting those eyes, that fly, the car..."
slokes,"Aug 10, 2004",10/10,"What can you say about a film that's been talked about to death? Just this: If you've never seen it, you owe it to yourself to do so, not because it's a way of paying homage to the one true master of modern film, but because it's so fun to watch.Janet Leigh plays a bored office drone who decides to steal some loot from her boss's obnoxious client and parlay it into a new life with her all-too-distant boyfriend. All is going more or less according to plan until she stops in at the wrong motel, where she befriends a friendly if somewhat nerdy desk clerk only to find it causes problems with that clerk's possessive mother, who as her boy explains, ""is not herself today."" I'll say she isn't, and so would Leigh's Marion Crane, who maybe should have put up that ""Do-Not-Disturb"" sign before taking a shower.You can feel the decade literally shifting out of '50s and into '60s with this one. Even the opening shot, where the camera looks over a Western U.S. city in the middle of the afternoon and zooms in on what looks exactly like the Texas School Book Depository overlooking Dealey Plaza. Norman Rockwell touches abound, like the decor of the motel, but look at what's going on around it. People dress well, they still wear fedoras and jackets, but in their tense conversations and hooded gazes you can feel the culture just ticking away like a time bomb waiting to explode.Most especially, there's Anthony Perkins, who plays motel clerk Norman Bates in a very oddly naturalistic way, complete with facial tics and half-swallowed words, not the polished image one expected to see then. Just compare him with John Gavin, who plays Marion's boyfriend in the standard-actor-of-the-day way. Perkins manages to be so weirdly magnetizing, even in small moments like the way he stumbles on the word ""falsity"" or notes how creepy he finds dampness to be.He shines in bigger scenes, too, like his tense chat with Martin Balsam's boorish but diligent private detective character, Arbogast, who along with Perkins and Leigh delivers a landmark performance. The way both actors play out the awkwardness in their conversation makes you literally sweat. Then again, you're always uneasy around Norman. You definitely feel wary of him right away, but you find yourself liking him, too, even when he's busy covering up ""Mother's"" misdeeds. Not since Bela Legosi played Dracula did you get a horror movie with such a compelling central figure.If you are sampling the many other comments here, be sure to look up Merwyn Grote's. He makes an interesting, compelling case for how director Alfred Hitchcock used his television series as a template for ""Psycho."" Certainly ""Psycho"" looks more like early 1960s television than any of the more sumptuous fare Hitchcock had been bringing to screen at the time. Not only is it in black-and-white, not color, but the sets; a ramshackle motel, a mothbally old house, a couple of cheap looking bedrooms, a bathroom in a used-car dealership, are deliberately low class.It's thrilling to see Hitchcock move so effectively outside his normal element, and move things along with such clinical detachment and low-key technical finesse. Thrilling, too, to realize this is one of his most accomplished products; made by a man who was experienced enough to know how the game was played, and daring enough still to break the rules; indeed, start a whole new ballgame.Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.Often imitated, parodied, referenced, and analyzed to death, ""Psycho"" still isn't played out nearly 45 years after it came out. You owe it to yourself to pay a visit to the Bates Motel; Norman has a room ready."
llihilloh,"Nov 25, 2000",10/10,"This is one of the best movies ever created and Alfred Hitchcock is one of the most intriguing film makers ever to live. (in my opinion) There's just so much to say about this film I hardly know where to start.I first saw this movie about five years ago and wasn't impressed at all. Of course, I was about ten years old at the time. I didn't think that the famous shower scene was anything to frightening and the characters seemed a little boring. A little less than a year ago, I became very interested in the history of the film and not so much of the film itself. I read articles, reviews, anything that I could get my hands on. Then, Psycho was shown on AMC and I immediately thought that it was a masterpiece. Shame on me for not appreciating it sooner.The film as a whole is spectacular, but I like to break it down into little sections. First, I was very surprised and impressed with the actors that played Marion Crane and Norman Bates. Janet Leigh isn't given to much exposure to the film since she is killed off in about the middle of it. I thought that she did a good but not great job. On the other hand, Anthony Perkins blew me away. Both Norman and Anthony are very interesting. Norman's life that is set up and shown to us is so well depicted that I can't imagine anybody else playing the part. All of the characters including Arbogast, Lila, and Sam are so well created.Obviously, the plot is so unique and odd that you can't help but smile at it. A young woman on the run after stealing $40,000, and then accidentally falls into the wrong hands of a psychopath. It's great! The best thing is that nobody has ever done anything quite like it, and they won't be able to because then the magic will be gone.Even though the ever so famous shower scene is said to be one of the most chilling death scenes in history, I think that it may be a little overrated. I love it as much as the next person, but it's not all that scary. Who said it was supposed to be scary? Nobody, I know. But the majority of the Psycho audience gathers it to be very frightening. I do still think that it is one of the greatest and shocking scenes ever.The setting is very well set up as well. The Bates motel and house is so cleverly created that it brings a special atmosphere to the audience. It has something about it that you just can't forget.Finally, that music played throughout the film is one of the most spookiest sounds I have ever heard. Great job to the music composers and to Hitchcock for this scary addition to the movie.I think it's safe to say that everybody has heard of Psycho, but not everyone has seen it. For those of you who still haven't seen this amazing flick, go see it! It's a must see."
Popenoe,"Jan 17, 1999",N/A,"When you look up the phrase ""Horror Film"" in the dictionary .. a picture of Janet Leigh screaming in a shower should appear next to it. Undoubtedly, Psycho is the greatest horror film ever made, bar-none. The story is incredible. The acting is near perfection. The cinematography is godly. The soundtrack is perfect. It's hard to find anything wrong with Psycho. Perhaps the only imperfection I can find with Psycho is the inability to stand the test of time. One of the reasons the shower scene has become so notorious is that it's not only filmed to perfection, but because the elements of sexuality and murder are so surreal. In 1960, seeing a nude women being murdered in a shower was something that no-one had experienced yet, and was quite shocking. Nowadays, seeing Jason double-spearing two lovers having sex is nothing uncommon. I envy those who experienced Psycho in 1960 in the theaters .. those experienced the full terror of Psycho.Aside from this though, the movie is flawless. I won't even go into to how incredible the cinematography is. One thing I think people seem to forget about the movie is the incredible soundtrack. Sound is such an important element in movies and Psycho is undaunted when it comes to sound. The only other horror movie that even comes close to using sound with such perfection is Halloween (1978).The movie is perfectly casted as well. Janet Leigh as the beautiful Marion Crane, Vera Miles as the concerned sister, Lila Crane, and of course the unforgettable performance from Anthony Perkins as the eerie yet charismatic Norman Bates.I would recommend this movie to any horror movie film fanatic. I would especially recommend this movie to any horror movie fan not desensitized by Friday The 13th, Nightmare On Elm Street, or Scream .. if such a fan exists."
Cornpick,"Jul 19, 2007",7/10,"As with most very old films, Psycho is unlikely to have the same impact on a modern audience than it had upon its first release. So those who are watching it expecting the 'masterpeice' they are often told it is, prepare to be disappointed. Having said that, if you take Psycho of its pedestal as 'one of the greatest films of all time' (though through a historical perspective and in terms of influence, the title is richly deserved' and watch it treat it for what it is, a psychological horror, than the film remains very enjoyable. The acting performance put on by Anthony Perkins is highly believable and at times chilling and, if you have not been exposed to the shows twists and ending already, they still have the potential to shock and surprise even the most seasoned horror fan. On the subject of horror fans, it is worth a watch on that merit alone or for any fan of cinema, to see the film that has shaped cinema today more than almost any other film"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 15, 2023",10/10,"Marion Crane steals $40,000 from her employer, running away from suspicions and her own guilt, she checks into The Bates Motel, a quiet, out of the way establishment, run by Norman Bates.Oh boy, this film is quite something. Hitchcock truly was the master of suspense, but he proves he could do horror to, Psycho is the perfect fusion of Horror and Suspense.What audiences in 1960 must have thought when they say down to watch this for the first time, when you think what had come before, this film truly was a game changer.Pacing is sensational, it doesn't hold up for a second, the suspense element is tremendous, first time viewers are in for several shocks, when the big moments come, they are hammered home.There are several sensational scenes, but that shower sequence, that rates as one of the greatest movie moments of all time.Anthony Perkins delivers a performance which is nothing short of remarkable, he's so soft and gentle initially, but the switch up, is incredible. Why he wasn't Oscar nominated is beyond me.The music, as big a character as Norman Bates himself, even on the opening sequences it's powerful and alarming, but the score that accompanies the killings, talk about hairs standing up on the back of the neck.One of my top ten greatest film of all time.10/10."
sddavis63,"Jun 1, 2011",6/10,"""Psycho"" has gone down in Hollywood history as one of the greatest of horror movies, and even if you've never seen it (which I hadn't until today) you still feel a certain connection to the movie just on the basis of its reputation. That in itself can be a problem, because you're expecting a lot when you watch it for the first time. Unfortunately, for me at least, this didn't quite live up to its billing. It was a good movie, Alfred Hitchcock did a good job of directing with a number of what are today recognized as typical ""Hitckcock-ian"" touches, particularly with some very effective camera work, and basically the cast, headed by Anthony Perkins as motel owner Norman Bates and supported by Janet Leigh, Vera Miles, John Gavin and Martin Balsam (I would say in that order of importance to the story) did a fine job. Still, I was expecting something more.First, I would call this more of a suspense movie with a touch of slasher movie thrown in than a horror movie, although that's admittedly through a modern lens. There are really only a couple of scenes that were ""horrific"" - one being the famous shower scene and one being the revelation of Norman's mother near the end of the movie. Otherwise you get a mystery - with the end surprise being fairly clearly telegraphed to anyone who was paying attention. The suspense starts with Marion (Leigh) stealing a large sum of money from the real estate agency where she works and running off, eventually coming to the Bates Motel to spend the night. Since the murder in the shower is the classic scene of the movie, you don't expect it to come as early as it does, and you don't expect that so much of the movie is going to revolve around Lila (Miles) and Sam (Gavin) as they search for Marion. Somehow, I expected to see more of Janet Leigh. Still, there is good suspense even if the surprise about Norman's mother is pretty clear from even a mile away.What knocked this down a bit for me, though, wasn't the obvious solution to the mystery. It was the seeming need to offer a very in depth psychological explanation near the end of what Norman was all about. Maybe there was a sense that movie-goers in 1960 would need such an explanation. I found what was virtually a closing soliloquy (and a very long one) by Simon Oakland playing a psychiatrist who's called in to examine Norman to be tedious in the extreme, and largely unnecessary; filled with psycho-babble. Norman could have been explained - if an explanation was felt necessary - much more succinctly.One can't diss this movie. There's really very little wrong with it, except that its reputation makes it very hard for it to live up to when you watch it. Undoubtedly, when watched with late 20th-21st century eyes (well conditioned to the point of being almost oblivious to slasher-type violence) it comes across as a bit dull, frankly. Equally undoubtedly, it didn't come across that way to audiences in 1960. Still, I found it to be a little bit of a letdown compared to what I was expecting of it. (6/10)"
stevenfallonnyc,"Jul 22, 2007",5/10,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling.And the ""shocking"" cellar scene almost plays like a comedy skit nowadays. When ""Mother"" is turned around in the chair, what you see just looks too funny not to laugh, and when Norman comes in, combined with his face, the way he was dressed, and the ""Psycho music"" at full bombast, I couldn't help but crack up for ten minutes at the hilarious combination of all this. Sorry to say, what was supposed to be such a frightening scene, is just too comedic to truly scare anymore.It's unreal to think ""Psycho"" was voted one of the scariest films ever made. Who does this movie actually scare?And the cop at the end, with his long-winded speech that sums up the whole picture (conveniently with the rest of the cast sitting and listening intently), is just too blatantly pandering that you just want to say, ""ok, I think we all get it now!"" You almost expect the cop to turn to the crowd in the theater and say, ""ok, does everyone understand now?""Even the very last shot of Norman is kind of funny, with the expressions he is making. The skull kind of saves the scene, but still.""Psycho"" is still recommended viewing for any old school movie fan, just to see Hitchcock's work. But the challenge is not to laugh at many certain scenes. The ""Making of"" documentary on the DVD is pretty decent (if not somewhat long winded itself) but the omission of deleted or rare scenes is definitely noticed. Janet Leigh is still very sharp though, and still looks great."
the rock-17,"Aug 30, 1999",10/10,"I am a big fan of Alfred Hitchcock.  I have seen all of his movies, and think all of them are excellent.  This one, however, is at the top of the food chain.  Psycho is brilliant.  Hitchcock gave this film excellent direction, and the acting was superb.  Especially Anthony Perkins playing the role of Norman Bates.  He always talked so fast, like he was nervous and anxious all the time.  When he talked to Marion Crane about his mother, it gave me chills down my spine.  ""She just...she just goes a little mad sometimes.  We all go a little mad sometimes.""  At that era, I don't think a better person could have delivered that line than Anthony Perkins.  What makes this movie so great is its originality.  Sure, there have been lots of films about ""psychos,"" but this is pretty much the first one.  The script was excellent, the acting was excellent, the direction was excellent, the cinematography was excellent, the music was excellent, the scenery was incredible, especially that dark old house where ""Mother"" lived.  I could just go on and on about what a great movie this is.  My grade: A+"
LoveCoates,"Jul 31, 2001",10/10,"Yes, everything you've heard is true. The score is a part of pop culture. The domestic conflict is well-known. But nothing shocks like the experience itself.If you have not seen this movie, do yourself a favor. Stop reading thse comments, get up, take a shower, then GO GET THIS MOVIE. Buy it, don't rent. You will not regret it.""Psycho"" is easily the best horror-thriller of all time. Nothing even comes close...maybe ""Les Diaboliques"" (1955) but not really.""Psycho"" has one of the best scripts you'll ever find in a movie. The movie's only shortcoming is that one of the characters seems to have little motivation in the first act of the movie but as the story progresses, you realize that Hitchcock (GENIUS! GENIUS! GENIUS!) in a stroke of genius has done this on purpose, because there is another character whose motivations are even more important. Vitally important. So important that you totally forget about anything else. I was lucky enough to have spent my life wisely avoiding any conversation regarding the plot of this movie until I was able to see it in full. Thank God I did! The movie has arguably the best mid-plot point and climactic twist in thriller history, and certainly the best-directed ending. The last few shots are chilling and leave a lingering horror in the viewer's mind.Just as good as the writing is Hitchcock's direction, which is so outstanding that it defies explanation. Suffice it to say that this movie is probably the best directorial effort by film history's best director. I was fortunate enough to see this movie at a big oldtime movie house during a Hitchcock revival. Janet Leigh, still radiant, spoke before the film and explained how Hitchcock's genius was in his ability to 1) frighten without gore and 2) leave his indelible mark on the movie without overshadowing his actors (like the great Jean Renoir could never do). ""Psycho"" is clearly its own phenomenon, despite all the big-name talent involved.Hitchcock does not disappoint by leaving out his trademark dark humor. His brilliance is in making a climax that is at once both scary and hilarious. When I saw it in the theatre the audience was both gasping in disbelief while falling-on-the-floor laughing.One more thing...Tony Perkins. Janet Leigh got much-deserved accolades for this film, but it is Perkins who gives what remains the single best performance by an actor in a horror movie. He is so understated that his brillance passes you by. He becomes the character. The sheer brillance of the role is evidenced by the ineptitude of the actors in Gus Van Sant's 1998 (dear God make it stop!) shot-for-shot ""remake."" Though the movies are nearly identical, Hitchcock's is superior mostly because of the acting and the atmosphere (some of the creepiness is lost with color). This is made obvious by the initial conversation between Leigh's character and Perkins, a pivotal scene. The brilliance of Perkins in the original shines even brighter when compared with the ruination in the remake even though the words and the shots were exactly the same. The crucial chemistry in this scene lacking in the remake gives everything away and mars our understanding of upcoming events. The fact that Perkins could never escape this role - his star stopped rising star as it had done in the 50s - proves that he played the part perhaps too well.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.Eleven-and-a-half out of ten stars."
Whizzer-2,"Oct 1, 1999",10/10,"Hitchcock was very fortunate to have cast the young Anthony Perkins in the leading role.  At the time there were some other young aspiring actors who might have qualified for the part, namely:  Michael J. Pollard; Jack Nicholson; Bruce Dern, Dean Stockwell, Victor Buono and Dennis Hopper.  However, it's hard for me to imagine anyone other than Perkins playing Norman Bates with complete authenticity, it's seems the role was simply made for him and only him.  Could you possibly imagine anyone other than Nicholson in the role of Randall P. McMurphy in ""One Flew Over The Cuckoo's Nest"" or Dennis Hopper as Billy in ""Easy Rider""?  Keep in mind the introverted, insecure Mama's Boy was not really PSYCHOpathic as Hannibal The Cannibal was in ""Silence of the Lambs"" - a cold-blooded killer with no conscience - but rather criminally insane, plagued by schizophrenic delusions and seriously in need of multiple reality-checks.  Anthony Hopkins did a wonderful job as the vicious Hannibal, and also as Corky, the schizo-killer ventriloquist in ""Magic"".  I think he just might have pulled off a convincing Norman, but don't believe he was available back then.  Oh well, so much for speculation...Perkins did a great job."
darkjosh,"Sep 12, 2000",9/10,"Most modern-day horror films make the killer to be an absolutely inhuman, grotesque, unimaginable monster in order to scare the audience out of its wits.  Most of the time, however, these stereotypes create a generic murderer a raving, ranting, clearly demented psychopath.  One of the few memorable cinematic killers that does not adhere to these restraints and cliches is, of course, Anthony Hopkins' Hannibal Lecter, whom manages to effectively cause the audience to recoil without such drek as the aforementioned devices.Anthony Perkins' skillfully crafts his performance as Norman Bates, avoiding a ranting, raving, drooling, murder-happy, manic characterization; instead his performance as Norman is subtle, creepy, cool, and unsettling.  He is brilliant; from his quiet conversations with Marion Crane amidst the stuffed birds, to his weasling wimpiness when confronted by Arbogast, his performance is so exact that it chills the viewer, all without the unnecessary disturbing images prevalent in more modern films (read The Cell, Henry: Portrait of A Serial Killer).Perkin's fine performance, a tight script, and Bernstein's classic score make Psycho a film that is now and will always be remembered as one of the pinnacles of the horror genre."

The highlight of the film is , of course , the shower scene , it was made with 70 cameras to shot the 45 seconds of footage and the creepy sound effects were realized by stabbing a knife into a melon . Magnificent credit titles by Saul Bass , he's usual on Hitchcock films .Excellent black and white cinematography by cameraman John Russell , as Hitch thought it would be very gory in colour . Bernard Herrmann's legendary musical score copied and endlessly imitated , aids to create a thrilling atmosphere . Film is directed with exquisite taste and intelligence by master Hitchcock who makes an impeccable control of every scene and maneuvers your emotions , infusing with a deliciously macabre wit , it makes ¨Psycho¨ far superior to the several movies what tried duplicate , or imitate it ; these are the following ones : ¨Psycho II¨ (1983) by Richard Franklin , ¨Psycho III¨ (1986) by Anthony Perkins himself and for cable television : ¨Psycho IV¨ (1990) by Mick Garris. Hitchcock's Psycho belongs to his best period in the 5os and 60s when he produced his finest works , perfecting the art of suspense in a series of masterpieces : ¨Dial M¨, ¨Rear window¨, ¨Vertigo¨, ¨North by Nortwest¨, ¨Birds¨ and specially ¨Psycho¨ , all of them are still studied and copied today . Rating : Indispensable and essential classic movie."
doodles-2,"Oct 15, 1998",N/A,"I saw this movie as a teenager when it was first released in the 1960's. The promotional hype for the film ensured you did not have a clue what it was about and people who had seen the movie were asked not to reveal the ending. You went to see it anticipating something scary and thats what you got. Even 30 years later I still remember sitting in a dark theatre with my heart pumping and everyone, and I mean everyone, screaming their lungs out.The movie set a new and very high standard in horror movies which I don't believe has ever been equaled. The characters were great, the direction perfect and the music, which I thought was absolutely fantastic, made this a classic.I still get scared when I see it on TV."
SoulersTV,"Dec 26, 2020",6/10,"Psycho is an extremely suspenseful, scary and wonderful film. For being filmed in Black and White, it also has an artistic feel to it like all Hitchcock films. The acting, dialogue and filming in this film are fantastic, something that feels it shouldn't be out of 1960 but is. At the end, (which I won't spoil) I was absolutely shocked, to say the least I didn't see it coming.Psycho is easily Hitchcock's best film and if you haven't watched it I would highly recommend.10/10"
shuhaabshah-3,"Oct 16, 2013",1/10,considering this was in the top 250 of IMDb its hard to not watch this movie. i was expecting great things and what not. but alas it was disappointing in every way imaginable. may be it was something amazing or different in 60's but today it is just another predictable movie which wont impress today's audience. Just after the first murder i predicted its ending and not to my surprise the ending was just as predicted by me (trying not to write any spoilers) ..why its in top 30 movies is just beyond me. maybe only old people are rating these movies. and there might be a lot of them.so yeah. its just not that thrilling or horrifying or anything it claims for today's audience. i am breaking the DVD right now.
Evilmike,"Sep 4, 1999",10/10,"I saw Psycho last night at the campus movie theatre and it was great, not to mention scary.  I mean I had never seen it before (except for parts on TV when I was small) and had no clue about the plot or the ending.  Untill the final scene I still thought it was the mother.  Now I'm one of those guys who can pick out the ending like half way through the film, but Psycho had me fooled all the way to the end.  Psycho may be great to watch again and again, but its even better the first time."
mardalsfossen01,"Dec 11, 2018",9/10,"I have never seen a movie that gave me this type of chills. VERY recommendable Horror/Mystery/Thriller!This movie is so far more than the one bathroom scene everybody knows.Watch it, you won't be disappointed!"
revival05,"Apr 19, 2000",10/10,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!"
TheLittleSongbird,"Dec 9, 2009",10/10,"I am a huge fan of Hitchcock, and have really liked all of the movies of his I have seen so far. My top 5 favourites are Vertigo, North By Northwest, Rear Window, Rebecca and this masterpiece. Before I saw this, I considered Vertigo as his masterpiece. After seeing this movie, I think Psycho outshines Vertigo.Psycho is a film that you see once and never forget, and one of the few movies out there that has left me traumatised. The infamous shower scene is without doubt one of the most terrifying murder scenes in any film. When I first saw that scene on the 100 Greatest American Films, I was so terrified and I admit it I have never recovered. I had a similar experience watching the Disney film Sleeping Beauty with Maleficent enticing Aurora to the spinning wheel, and Mrs Gulch turning into the Wicked Witch in the Wizard of Oz.The shower scene isn't the only effective or chilling scene in the film- in the events leading up to that scene I was biting my nails. The scene with the old woman in the chair also made me jump out of my skin. The whole of Psycho is terrifying, suspenseful and shocking. Two elements made this so. One was Hitchock's direction. The great director proves how truly great he is by directing Psycho in a masterful way, and manages to deliver the shocks when needed. The other is Bernard Hermann's music. What a creepy score! I loved his score for Vertigo and Miklos Rozsa's for Spellbound, but the high violin motif in the shower scene is the main reason why that scene in particular is so effective. I admit it, when I hear that motif, I start screaming. There is just something about it that makes your blood run cold.Other pros are a good plot, a well constructed screenplay and beautiful black and white cinematography that is perfect in conveying the creepy mood. And the ending did surprise me. The acting though was exemplary, with Janet Leigh giving one of the deservedly most memorable female performances in a Hitchcock movie, and Vera Miles also giving a stellar performance. Stealing the film is Antony Perkins as Norman Bates, he didn't just play creepy, he WAS creepy, his face, his voice, his mannerisms.. in short it is one of the most chilling performances of all time. All in all, a Hitchcock masterpiece! 10/10 Bethany Cox"
horrorkid87,"Nov 18, 2000",N/A,This movie is the best movie by Alfred Hitchcock ever.  That is hard to do to.  Because he did all the good scary movies back then such as Rear Window and The Birds.  I loved it I own the movie and parts 2 and 3 I like the shower scene.  Another good thing about this movie was that it had a good back ground the motel off the main highway and the creepy old house on the hill behind the motel this was scary for its time but not now.  However it still is a real good movie a classic.  The remake was ok but it can't match to this one.
mightyjoeyoung74,"Jun 12, 2005",7/10,"There is a difference between a serial killer movie and a good movie about a killer. To those sad few who think the movies like Gacy, Ed Gein, and Dahmer are of some quality, please burn those movies and simply watch a good movie about a killer ... PSYCHO! If you want to watch a good story about John Wayne Gacy, I'm sure one on A&E will be on any day now! Watch a documentary if you want the facts, if you would rather watch serial killers for entertainment, at least watch a movie with some quality and one that doesn't live off the infamy of the subjects last name!Check out my more in-depth review on my site timothynoble.com!"
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jun 12, 2018",6/10,"""Psycho"" is a true classic, which I doubt anyone would really argue against.It has a good story and an equally great presentation of the storyline on the screen.The movie has a good cast to perform the various roles and characters throughout the movie. And I will say that Anthony Perkins is just amazing in the role of Norman Bates, and he alone truly made Norman Bates immortal.""Psycho"" is adequately paced, because director Alfred Hitchcock truly was good at building up suspense and letting scenes lead up to interesting climaxes.While ""Psycho"" is not your average slasher movie with high body counts and gore in abundance, it has the right amount of suspense and thrills to make a proper movie. If you haven't already seen this classic horror movie, then you definitely should take the time to do so."
Scream-11,"Dec 13, 1998",2/10,"Okay, I'll agree that the shower scene is one of the scariest in movie history.  Hitchcock did an amazing job with that.  Unfortunately, the rest of the movie doesn't measure up.  The scary start whimpers away into a movie of confusion that can only be described as creepy at best, dull at worst. It's a classic, but that doesn't mean it's good."
pizandeng,"Mar 21, 2020",9/10,"It's a shame that Hitchcock never got an oscar proving that sometimes, the acadamy is just a joke."
hveiti,"Nov 27, 2000",10/10,"Not much to be said about this that hasn't been said before.  Only the second Hitchcock film I've ever seen, and so far there isn't a single positive thing that's been said about him that I can disagree with. Calling someone 'The Master' is terminology that I would usually frown upon as being too dismissive of other greatly talented people, but after witnessing the directing, the cinematography, the subtle performances, the inimitable atmosphere and the quiet genius of this masterpiece, I find myself forced to agree.  The notorious shower scene manages to be shocking, brutal and understated all at once, and its infamy on the pages of motion picture history is well-deserved.  Anthony Perkins is subtly explosive, like a match waiting to be struck.  He plays Bates with a boyish, grinning charm that generally belies his chilling insanity.  Also worthy of mention is Bernard Herrmann's incredible score, possibly one of the best I've ever heard.In a curious way, the one thing I find disagreeable about this movie is, indeed, its legend.  I cannot imagine how much I would have enjoyed it had I not known any of the plot twists beforehand, and could have gone into it unknowingly.  Still, perhaps somewhat paradoxically, the legend is completely due, because this film's merit becomes obvious when you consider that first-time viewers of my generation (I'm 21 years old), who have become inundated with the blood, gore and overblown special effects of today's blockbusters, can still find its subtle ingenuity chilling and scary in equal measure.  Beautiful. 10/10"
md006,"Feb 26, 2001",10/10,"Psycho is the all time greatest movie ever made in movie making history. It has this special style that could only be achieved through the eyes of Alfred Hitchcock and the excellent actors in the film.  There is this mysteriousness that presides over the movie, and that is what adds to the overall feeling from Psycho. Hitchcock's eye for great suspense really does the trick for this movie. He also chose to go Black and White in this movie, instead of color for his own stylistic purposes (and to hide the redness of...yeah.) The B&W really makes the movie more ""scary"". No one can forget the Bates Motel or the mysterious house on the hill behind it with ""that person"" in the window.  Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates also has his best performance of his career in this movie, bringing the character of Norman Bates to life. Even 40 years later, no movie is able to stand up to Psycho or make a larger impact on world culture.  Truly the best movie of all time, definitely a 10/10."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 16, 2024",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho,"" released in 1960, remains one of the most influential films in the history of cinema, setting new standards for the thriller genre with its groundbreaking techniques and psychological depth. From its iconic score to its masterfully crafted suspense, ""Psycho"" has left an indelible mark on filmmaking and storytelling.The film introduces us to Marion Crane, played by Janet Leigh, who impulsively decides to steal a large sum of money and escape from her mundane life. Her journey leads her to the secluded Bates Motel, where she encounters the enigmatic and unsettling owner, Norman Bates, portrayed brilliantly by Anthony Perkins. What unfolds is a captivating story filled with unexpected twists and turns that keep viewers on the edge of their seats.Hitchcock utilizes innovative filmmaking techniques that were revolutionary for its time. The stark black-and-white cinematography enhances the eerie ambiance, and the carefully composed shots create a sense of unease that permeates the film. The famous shower scene, with its rapid cuts and haunting score, is not only a pivotal moment in the narrative but also a striking example of Hitchcock's ability to manipulate viewer emotions.The score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is another standout element of ""Psycho."" The shrieking strings evoke tension and terror, perfectly complementing the film's startling moments and enhancing its psychological impact. Herrmann's music has since become emblematic of horror cinema, signifying dread in the most minimalist yet effective manner.The performances are outstanding, particularly Janet Leigh, whose portrayal of Marion Crane invites sympathy and connection from the audience. Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, straddling the line between charm and menace, and leaving viewers questioning his true nature.""Psycho"" delves into themes of identity, morality, and the darker aspects of human nature, inviting a range of interpretations and discussions. It challenges characters' motivations and decisions, presenting moral dilemmas that resonate throughout the narrative, leading to a haunting exploration of the human psyche.Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" is a timeless thriller that combines suspense, psychological depth, and innovative storytelling. Its influence on the horror genre and cinema as a whole cannot be overstated. Even decades after its release, ""Psycho"" continues to captivate audiences, proving that true horror often lies in the complexities of the human mind. This film is essential viewing for anyone interested in the art of filmmaking and the nature of suspense."
HK Cat,"Feb 20, 2000",N/A,"In reading the comments of some, I think that to have seen Hitchcock's Psycho when it opened in '60, is to fully understand its impact today. It was a masterpiece then and remains a masterpiece today. Superior direction and camera work, and as one person commented, the film was released at a time when [psychological] monsters in the form of the ""boy next door,"" was not explored in films. Yes, Psycho started slow by today's standards, but the style back then was to move from the pleasant familiar to the darkest of horrors. Hitchcock understood how to create atmosphere and mood. His shower scene, while some today wonder what the hoopla is all about, set a standard of horror in an ordinary setting. How many films have copied this scene? I remember as a kid, fearing showers and hotels after seeing this flick. Hitchcock reportedly said that it was a good thing he didn't place Crane on the toilet (sic), or people would have a phobia about toilets. Ironically, in Psycho 3 (?), a character was killed while on the toilet. The remake of two years ago sucked--big time. Hitchcock's Psycho not only had the master at the helm, but it was also a matter of timing in cinema history. Those elements cannot be duplicated."
Pteromysvolans,"Nov 7, 2003",6/10,"Sorry, but I've never understood why ""Psycho"" is considered by so many people to be the best horror movie of all times (I give it only 7/10). Very influental it is, yes. Maybe also I've just seen a bit too many dozens of mass murderer movies based more or less on ""Psycho"", that the original doesn't feel so special anymore?I think that a good movie must stand time and can be watched many times over and over again. Why should one want to watch ""Psycho"" again? The plot is so easy to guess even when seeing the movie first time that I find there not too much excitement.What's the plot and idea of this movie? Some nut just goes killing innocent people, because he's crazy, and that's the whole story. Period. Scary? Well, as much as irrational violence is scary.I also find it disgusting that in many horror movies psychotic people are often portrayed as the cause of all evil, when most of them are only very sick and mostly not particularly harmful to anyone. What is really scary - in real life or on a film - are people basically having everything ok and a good mental health, but still often doing horrible things, including irrelevant violence. Most violence in the world is done by such ""normal"" people.I think that Hitchcock has many better movies than ""Psycho"". For example ""Rear Window"" is a true classic in its minimalism, though maybe not particularly scary, at least in the way modern horror movies playing mainly on special effects are. Anyway, there you have just an ordinary guy, could be your nextdoor neighbour, who cruelly kills his wife etc., Now that's a scary idea, and the plot makes you think too."
AgentDice,"Oct 21, 2013",10/10,"Without a doubt one of the most influential films of all time. Timeless classic.Whether this is a true slasher film is debatable, but it's influence on the genres of horror and suspense/thriller is undeniable.This masterpiece uses amazing black and white cinematography and a very low bodycount (yes, that's correct, a very low bodycount) to weave a fascinating story of a woman caught in a criminal web of her own doing who stops off at the wrong motel on a wet and rainy night. She meets the inn-keeper, a fragile and soft spoken young man who is emotionally and verbally pushed around by his overbearing mother.What follows is a tension filled and horrifying tale of psychological suspense. I have heard others comment that this film is not really ""scary"", and I beg to differ. Nothing to me could be more terrifying than the reality that people like some of those presented in this film truly exist in our world. It takes a lot more than fake blood and overly-gory special effects to impress me, and the sad thing is that today's ""horror"" films and even some claiming to be suspense films rely too much on the supernatural or just plain disgusting to achieve their affect. None of that for me thanks.One of my true pleasures is to see someone view this film for the first time. Moments in the film tend to shock or surprise people who think they've seen it all. Those who have seen enough knock-offs (and there are a TON of them) may figure out some of the story's plot before it is revealed, but only because so many films have shamelessly ripped this one off. See it for the first time (and even a tenth) and enjoy a master director at the peak of his craft."
xyzkozak,"Jun 1, 2015",7/10,"Below are 2 quotes from actor Anthony Perkins who had played the pivotal role of Norman Bates in Hitchcock's ""Psycho"". I think these quotes are sure to be of some interest to anyone who is at all familiar with this film and its legacy to the genre of horror.(1) ""Hitchcock thought of Psycho (1960) as a comedy. When it first came out, it was greeted with screams of laughter. People laughed all the way through, so much so that he declared it was the first time he had ever been out-thought by an audience. He knew it was going to be funny, but he didn't realize it was going to be that funny.""(2) ""Not many people know this, but I was in New York rehearsing for a play when the shower scene was filmed in Hollywood. It is rather strange to go through life being identified with this sequence knowing that it was my double. Actually, the first time I saw Psycho and that shower scene was at the studio."".... Well, there you have it."
THE FRA,"Jan 16, 2000",10/10,"Ever wonder what the movie history would be like, if the ""genius"" of Hitchcock, were never brought to silver screen? Aside from the story line, the cast, and the acting, the highest point of this film, to myself, is the camera direction. Being a past film and tv school grad', all I can say is, this one is a masterpiece. The angles and the way he let's the camera, lead or suggest to the viewer, the next scene,is alone, among the best direction of any movie. To see what Im saying, when next shown, turn the volume off, and just let the camera , under his direction, tell you the story. I believe one will get a different understanding of this film, and a greater appreciation of the director."
jotix100,"Nov 1, 2005",10/10,"""Psycho"", the Hitchcock masterpiece of 1960, is still a scary ride. TCM presented it on Halloween night, which was an appropriate way to add to all the horror being shown on television.As the film opens, we are treated to Saul Bass' titles that herald some of what one is expecting will come in the film. Then, one hears the magnificent opening bars of Bernard Herrmann's music score and one realizes this is not an ordinary movie. The crisp black and white cinematography by John Russell, as well as the intelligent editing by George Tomasini, surpass any doubt this was one of Alfred Hitchcock's best work. Of course, the film owes a debt to Joseph Stefano who adapted the Robert Bloch novel, in which the movie is based, with great flair.""Psycho"" works because of the wonderful cast assembled for the movie. Anthony Perkins was an actor who could play anything. His range was enormous, as he shows in the film. His Norman Bates shows a man that appears to be in complete control of himself. We watch him as he begins to unravel when confronted first by Arbogast, and then by Sam Loomis. Mr. Perkins' performance is one of the best he ever gave in his film career.Janet Leigh who plays Marion Crane is perfect as the small would be criminal who happens to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time. It's a tribute to Ms. Leigh's talent that she underplays Marion because she is battling with her own conscience as she realizes the enormity of what she has done. Alas, she was not going to make good on her resolve.The supporting cast is also interesting. Martin Balsam plays the private detective well. He is instrumental in cracking Norman's confidence, but of course, it comes with a high price he must pay for trying to shake the sick man. Vera Miles and John Gavin are seen as Marion's sister and boyfriend.""Psycho"" will remain an exercise in horror by a man who knew how to scare us, Alfred Hitchcock!"
maestrocomics2,"Feb 6, 2000",10/10,"I feel that this movie is superior to Alfred Hitchcock's other films and that it, rather than ""Vertigo"", should be considered his masterpiece.  Even though it was shot on a small budget, its suspense, thanks to Hitchcock's direction, Tomasini's flawless editing, and Bernard Herrmann's still holds up on multiple viewings.  Also important to the film is solid acting from Anthony Perkins, Janet Leigh, Vera Miles and Martin Balsam and John L. Russell's constantly under-rated photography."
Leofwine_draca,"Jul 28, 2014",10/10,"PSYCHO truly is an excellent film, a movie which, along with the same year's PEEPING TOM, managed to kick start a new genre of psychological thrillers which continues to this day. It's perfectly made, with an excellent story (thanks to the reliable schlockmeister Robert Bloch), a great script adaptation, and assured direction from Hitchcock.It's hard to know what stands out here the most: the brooding cinematography, in which features such as the Bates Motel become characters in their own right, or Anthony Perkins's most famous role. Perkins encapsulates Bates perfectly, making him a bogeyman far more frightening than the OTT fantasy creations of a Freddy Krueger or Jason Vorhees.Watching it today, it's tough to imagine sitting through it without knowing the various twists beforehand, but they must have been mind-blowing to newcomers. And one of the things I like best is that the film is already great, and thrilling, even before the action shifts to the Bates Motel. Add in a great Martin Balsam performance and you have one of the greatest masterworks of 20th century cinema, in my humble opinion."
Rosebud-49,"Sep 21, 1999",9/10,"Only a sinister organization such as the Academy would bypass Alfred Hitchcock as Best Director in 1960. Psycho is a masterpiece and Hitch will be remembered for centuries regarding his classic portrayal of a young Norman Bates, his run-down motel, and the mysterious relationship and death of his Mother. From Sam Loomis, Marion and Lila Crane, Detective Arbogast, Mr. Lowry, and even the used car salesman, Psycho is filled with astonishing characters, suspenseful plot twists, and a climax that would make every child in America think twice before entering the basement.Alfred Hitchcock was an American icon and Psycho is a true reflection of his genius. To his day, Psycho remains one of best films of its genre. Further, Hitchcock's talent has stood the test of time, ultimately earning him the most honorable surname ""The Master of Suspense""."
alicevipgirl,"Dec 9, 2015",6/10,"I'm not putting a spoiler because I'm talking about the shower scene, and if you don't know that scene, I'm sorry but you must not know anything. THIS is why I was so hard on Frankenstein! This is what horror should look like! It actually gets to you! We still have a ways to go, but this is definitely an improvement. That shower scene? After watching it, I realized just how easy it would be to kill someone in the shower. You're virtually deaf to everything going on outside of the shower! I realized that before, but now, my imagination can run wild with the idea of someone trying to break into my house and kill me in the shower! This is what horror and psychological thrillers are supposed to do! Mess with your head! Oh, and the camera-work and lighting were awesome too! There were some moments that were kinda unrealistic, but that's part of Hitchcock's thing. So, all in all, I really liked this movie."
flygirl-on-the-roof,"Jan 29, 2005",10/10,"This film will never be outdated. It's a perfect example of the art of shocking and disturbing an audience without ever having to resort to graphic violence and gore. Excellent atmosphere, superbly talented actors, and a brilliantly demented storyline -- those easily add up to an entertaining movie night no matter how many times you have watched it in the past. You know all the lines, you know the ending, but you're still pulled in from the first second to the end credits every single time. It's a rare film that accomplishes this with such a massive audience.This film deserved better sequels and it definitely didn't deserve the terrible late 1990s remake, but the merit in this first installment actually helps all of those to hold up better than they otherwise would.Absolutely timeless, and SO much more than just a classic! :)"
Superspy,"Sep 20, 1998",10/10,"I just saw Psycho for the first time about 3 weeks ago....and I'm still in awe. Alfred Hitchcock is the greatest film-maker of all time. Every shot in that movie, couldn't have been done better. I was amazed that I hadn't heard about the movie...well, what happens in it, in all my 20 years :)  And I'm so glad that I never heard anything....cause it was so fun to watch :) Anthony Perkins, IS Norman Bates. No one could have picked a better man for the role. He's just so darn cute :) It is a WONDERFUL movie...and beautifully done. Hitchcock is a master in his trade :)"
Neve_Fan,"Aug 11, 1998",10/10,"Psycho is just unbelievable!  The dialogue, the camera work, the suspense, the music!  Everything!  Just seeing how disturbed Norman Bates is, is a very creepy thing.  Hitchcock filmed this without one imperfection.  He used a lot of mirrors in Psycho, and I personally think the scariest scene in the entire movie is where Marion's sister goes up to ""Mrs. Bates"" room, and she thinks she sees someone behind her, and turns around, but its just herself in the mirror.  Another very interesting thing about Psycho was all the bird references.  Marion's last name is ""Crane"" Norman even says to her ""You eat like a bird"" and Norman's office is filled with stuffed birds.  Psycho's shower scene is by far the most suspenseful moment in the history of film.  I think so anyway!  To finish this up, I'd just like to say that Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is a classic, and no one should be remaking it!!! !!"
Hitch-26,"Sep 9, 2000",10/10,"Revolutionary in its time, Hitchcock's Psycho still shocks today when viewed.  It is the standard that every horror movie is judged by.  Filmed in black and white, everything in this movie--the music, the dialogue, the scenery, etc. is perfectly in sync and is a big reason this movie is a classic.  One bad thing is that I read somewhere that one of the goofs in the movie is when Janet Leigh is killed in the bathroom and staring at the camera, you can see her adam's apple moving.  I had never noticed that, but after reading that I noticed it the next time I watched it and it sort of ruined the illusion for me.  Oh well, that was about the only thing wrong with this movie.  Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Vera Miles, John Gavin, and Martin Balsam are all outstanding.  Herrmann's score is one of his best, and there are so many memorable scenes that you just need to go watch it right now. One of Hitch's 5 best."

If you haven't seen this movie and like horror flicks WATCH THIS.  And even if you don't like horror that much watch this anyway.  It's truly great film by the master of suspense."
Brian-272,"Nov 4, 2000",9/10,"Hitchcock's 1960 classic Psycho has it all to start with romance, embezzlement, disappearance, secrets, voyeurism, a dead corpse, a split personality of a man who thinks from time to time he's his dead mother and of course death in the most famous scene of all time the scene of Janet Leigh getting stabbed to death in the shower. The first time I saw Psycho as a kid and seeing the shower scene it terrified me so much I actually became afraid to take a shower I had great fear of getting stabbed to death even in my own home. As any child would do myself included they grow away from the terror of scare scenes as age increases, but recently I have looked at the famous shower scene from a different perspective. Many are unaware but it took seven days to shoot the shower scene, seventy camera positions for the forty-five seconds of very famous footage not an actual bare breast or plunging knife is to be found in the final cut, just illusion through montage. Now I begin my discussion on montage for those who don't know it's meaning or importance. Montage is a distinct type of editing that brings more drama to film and it links shots of film together and the editing separates and makes a film different from other forms of art. Montage was developed from the Soviet Union. Montage was used in very distinct ways in Psycho mostly crafted from Russian editor and director Eisenstein whose editing technique clashing of images or more properly known as a graphic match in film. Actually both similar terms can be explained first clashing of images create conflict just as in the shower scene the images flashing quickly of the knife and Janet Leigh's body symbolize the action and drama of the film while tied to the music of the Psycho shower scene. The term graphic match is very symbolic to show that life goes down the drain. To explain in the shower scene as Janet Leigh is stabbed and her body slides down with the shower curtain breaking the camera does a very close angle shot of her eye and then the camera slowly but surely makes it way to the blood and water flowing down the drain to symbolize death. This is a great example of graphic match it does exactly what it says by taking two unlike objects as in this case an eye and a drain of a tub to compare the action and drama that just unfolded in a scene with blood and water going down the drain symbolizing death while the eye open and an open drain show that life is no more. Finally enough about the famous shower scene everyone should know by now the story and technique behind it and how it was done to perfection, but I end my discussion of the scene I don't what you to think that your in a cinema history class! Hey don't forget how great a film Psycho is it has several other good reasons for it's classic ranking besides the shower scene with montage to start the intelligent directing of Alfred Hitchcock he simply was the master at keeping people in suspense and Psycho is full of suspense from start to finish. Also another interesting moment is to notice Hitchcock as the pedestrian outside the office in the very first few minutes of Psycho it was common for Alfred to make small appearances in his movies. And Anthony Perkins was great as the best and most liked Psycho character of our time the famous Norman Bates. The character had such intelligent wit and yet evil twisted means. So make reservations to the Bates Motel you will enjoy this classic of strange happenings at a rundown motel. I added this movie to my video library just this year and I recommend that anyone add Psycho to a personal movie collection of their own. After 40 years and beyond we all still have the right to go a little mad."
tjooljo,"Aug 23, 2022",6/10,Is there something I missed or did it so happen I was to tired to properly enjoy this movie? I had heard so many great things about this movie so I thought I would enjoyed it more. Instead I almost fell asleep 6 times. The twists for me at least were easily predictable and I already knew the famous shower scene. Maybe I should re-watch in a few years and I may enjoy it more. Or maybe I expected more? Maybe I thought the movie would deliver more than what it had to give? There are hundred of thousands of reviews on this movie and almost everyone rates it high for once I feel special.
invisibleunicornninja,"Nov 22, 2018",4/10,"This movie is so bad that I almost would've thought that I watched the wrong movie if it hadn't been for the opening credits. Are all these positive reviews fake? Has no one that has seen this movie also seen a good horror movie? Are people really that easily manipulated? I don't know. I'm going to try to avoid any spoilers in my review of this mess, as people seem to care about it, but honestly there is so little to this movie that there isn't really anything to spoil.The first hour of this movie is extremely boring. Everything is dragged out to pad the runtime. The entire opening scene doesn't even have anything to do with anything that happens after. Towards the middle of the movie, there is a scene in a shower that is so poorly edited and acted that it left me laughing hysterically. I'm pretty sure the scene was supposed to be scary, but honestly I can't see anyone being on the edge of their seat from a performance like that. After that scene, a detective character shows up, and he is kind of interesting, but he dies after less than 10 minutes, so it's kind of pointless. The movie remains mildly entertaining after that, but it's not amazing or anything.The main thing that makes me hate this movie is the closing scene. The truth about the villain is revealed in an exposition dump that lasts like 5-10 minutes. The reason why I don't like it is because this could've been a very interesting plot point that could've been developed over the course of the movie, but is instead just relegated to a plot twist. If we had spent the movie following a villain like that, it would've been really interesting, or maybe even scary. You could say that they didn't do this because they were focusing on the victims, but this movie has no character development. No one grows over the course of the movie, and you don't learn about the personalities or backstories of pretty much anyone.The filmmaking is ok. It's competant. Nothing special. The only interesting shot that stands out is one around a staircase. That's it.Overall, this is a really boring, pointless, and meandering movie with a wasted concept. The only reason why anyone is praising this is because people like Alfred Hitchcock. Or they're just easily scared? I don't know. I really don't recommend watching this one."
RESERVOIR SIM,"Nov 24, 1999",9/10,"I watched this movie  because it was Hitchcocks anniversary and it was one of those films I'd been dying to see and I thought it was great {I didn't think it was as good as a lot of people had told me though}. The twist about mother was cool, second  best in history next to the Sixth Sense. I thought 2 and 3 were cool too.  Anthony Perkins  was really good as Norman Bates."
bkoganbing,"Oct 18, 2006",9/10,"During the Mid Eighties I attended a science fiction convention in Manhattan and the feature attraction there was Anthony Perkins. There was Mr. Perkins, the celebrated Norman Bates of Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho among all the Trekkies and Doctor Who fans, etc. I think he looked on it as an opportunity to promote the succeeding Psycho films.Tony Perkins was clearly ill at ease among the Sci-Fi crowd. People like the Star Trek cast members know what to expect at these gatherings and act accordingly. Perkins did not really know how to handle the banter, he was in my estimation a serious guy who must have thought he was in a freak show. I asked him about appearing in Friendly Persuasion with Gary Cooper and I told him that that was my favorite role he did. He looked grateful that someone knew he did something besides Norman Bates.But for better or worse, Norman Bates became his career role and it's what we remember Anthony Perkins for. He does create an indelible impression on the screen with Alfred Hitchcock's direction as the shy mother fixated man running a flea bag motel in an area where a new super highway has taken all the potential business.Psycho has a simple plot. Janet Leigh on an impulse embezzles $40,000 in cash from her employer and goes on the run. She winds up in the Bates motel run by Norman and his mother. Later on private detective Martin Balsam goes after her as well. And finally John Gavin as Leigh's boy friend and Vera Miles as her sister go looking for the both of them.Simple enough, but Alfred Hitchcock creates a mood of terror and suspense that lingers long after you've seen the film. My favorite shot of the film is not Leigh's legendary shower stabbing, but of Martin Balsam being knocked down and falling down that flight of stairs and then being stabbed to death. The camera work showing Balsam falling backwards is the most terrifying part of Psycho.Though Anthony Perkins did so many other good things, the average cinema fan will tell you 99 out of 100 times that Norman Bates is the role he remembers Perkins for. So Perkins went with the flow.It was repetitious for him, but a treat for fans."
harpo-19,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"Anthony Perkins is absolutely perfect as Norman Bates.  He should have been at least nominated for Best Actor.  Hitchcock keeps us on the edge of our seat, we never know what is coming next.  The ""shower scene"" is definitely one of the most frightening scenes is motion pictures--because it was so unexpected.  Highly recommended!!"
pinewood35jack,"Feb 21, 2000",10/10,"This is one of the most stunning movies my eyes have ever gazed upon. Anthony Perkins was electric in his performance as a deranged motel owner. I feel the direction was quite magnificent. I was amazed every time the camara pointed up the path to view the house on the hill where Norman Bates lived. The suspense was immense, at the beginning where Janet Leigh is about to steal the money and then sees her boss when she's leaving town to what would be a terrifying death. Movies this good are very rare and if you don't own a copy then I advise you get one as you can watch it over and over again."

dougdoepke,"Sep 2, 2013",N/A,"In sixty years of movie watching there's one extended scene in Psycho that I count as being of unsurpassed brilliance. That's the about 7-minute scene in Norman's parlor where Marion has a bite of dinner shortly after arriving at the motel. To get an idea of its impact and significance, the setting is important. The parlor is dimly lit, casting shadows appropriate to the Gothic plot. Norman sits on one side, a stuffed raptor on the adjacent wall. It's shrewdly placed since the menacing wing-spread can background Norman when Hitch so chooses. Marion sits on the opposite side in a more conventionally lit setting, bespeaking her more conventional nature. Significantly, Hitch cross-cuts between them the entire time, never showing them in the same frame, thus emphasizing Norman's uniqueness and dominating part of the conversation.Now Norman is clearly unsure how to talk to the attractive woman alone with him in this, a private room. So he launches into a safe topic for him, but completely inappropriate to the light meal Marion is eating, namely his hobby, taxidermy. That is, how he likes to stuff birds but not the gore that comes with beasts. This tells us the important point that Norman is inexperienced socially, an aspect that fits in as the various parts of his nature come together over the movie's time-line. Throughout the tete-a-tete, Marion maintains a cautious but polite reserve as Hitch crosscuts between them. Her role here is mainly to draw the boyish stranger out.From taxidermy the dialog takes a more intimate turn. What emerges from the next topic, namely how to fill one's time, is that Norman is uncomfortable with his life with Mom. At the same time, however, he tries to casually laugh it off, one of his main defense mechanisms. Marion suggests that perhaps he should leave, that is, go away. But Norman senses something. He may be confused about a lot of things, but he's intuitive when he interjects that Marion must be running away from something, as indeed she is.At this point the conversation takes on a momentum that is revealing more and more about Norman's inner life. That's apparent when he starts talking ominously about private traps from which no one can escape—how we ""scratch and claw"" (like a bird) but never to any avail. To Marion, this is a challenge to escape the embezzlement trap she's gotten herself into. To Norman, it's a disclosure of how he views his own life, and an excuse for not doing anything about it as though in his madness he could.At this point, Marion senses Norman's problem lies with his mother and suggests that he get away from the motel and from her. Once the topic turns to Mother, Hitch frames Norman in the foreground with the ominous stuffed bird (Mother) looming over him. Now we know Norman is indeed trapped and that Marion is venturing into dangerous territory. She accelerates the danger by suggesting that he should put Mom away, like ""in an institution or something"". This triggers a sudden, hostile response as Norman associates strangers and unfamiliar surroundings with thoughts of death, as indeed it would be for him. But true to his defense mechanisms, he does an abrupt 180 and laughs off the suggestion with the supreme irony that whatever her problems, at least Mom's ""harmless"". Then in another note of supreme irony, he trivializes her problem by saying that anyway we all go ""a little mad sometimes"". This of course would include Marion by inference, who now has a sense of her own embezzlement predicament and breaks off the conversation by resolving to return to Phoenix and face the music. At the same time, Norman reverts to his usual affable façade. And the scene ends. But unbeknownst to Marion, she may have resolved one trap, but has now entered a far more deadly one.This is the central scene of the film. It's not the most dramatic, but it is the one where we gain important insight into Norman's mental processes. Now as good as the writing and direction are, it's really Tony Perkins's exquisite performance that makes the seven minutes absolutely spellbinding. Watch how quickly and persuasively he changes expression and mood. Because of his expertise, we know that something's seriously wrong with Norman, but can't be sure exactly what, while it takes the rest of the movie to find out. One moment, he's all boyish charm, the next he's glaring darkly with inner fire.Of course, Janet Leigh's superb performance as Marion should not be overlooked. In this key scene, her task is to politely draw out Norman's feelings, an essentially secondary role, but demanding in its own way. Note how delicately she balances her bites of food with proper emotional composure as this strange man reveals more of himself to her. Without doubt, this was an actress with more than just a pretty face.To me, Perkins' eccentric performance is clearly Oscar worthy, ditto the picture itself, along with Hitch's masterful direction. But industry prejudices against horror movies was just too strong then and perhaps now. Of course, it didn't help for Oscar purposes that the production was also low-budget b&w. But I doubt the audience impact would have been nearly as great had that unforgettable package been upscaled in any fashion. At the same time, a big part of the classic flick, in my book, at least, rests with that 7-minutes of emerging horror, so brilliantly understated."
chloehorror,"Jul 30, 2015",6/10,"A lot of people have different opinions on this, mines rather mixed. There is only one bit of this movie i didn't fully understand (and I may sound completely dumb for mentioning it, it's probably something rather easy to understand!) but in the film, the male hotel keeper carry's his mother down the stairs after asking her to hide and you can see him carry his mother down stairs but later on in the movie the policeman says he dressed up as his mother and acted like her etc? If that's so, who was the women that he carried down the stairs? All in all, it's an alright movie, most of the women really reminded me of Marilyn Monroe It's a good old horror though! :)"
divyanshthegreat,"Oct 27, 2014",3/10,"Granted, this movie might be of a lot of artistic value, with all the cinematography amongst other things, and also it might have scared a lot of people in the older generations. But I don't see any reason why this movie should be rated 1st amongst the Horror movie genre top 10 in contemporary times. Imagine an average Joe who wants to spend his precious weekend day watching a good horror flick with his girlfriend to get to cosying up. He would expect the no. 1 in horror genres on IMDb to be pretty scary to say the least.Not only did this movie failed to ""horrify"" the both of us, we did not find this much of an entertaining thriller as well(as it is just that--a thriller). Not sure why it's listed in the horror category. Do not recommend this movie if your situation is similar to what I described above. Maybe if you're a movie enthusiast who loves the cinematographic detail, go ahead..."
bamamatman,"Dec 29, 1999",10/10,"To cinema lovers everywhere, Alfred Hitchcock was a god.  And while he may not have created the heavens and the earth, he did create something possibly more amazing: Psycho.  Hitchcock once said that he did not care about the acting so much as the technical elements of the film, but he pulled uniformly outstanding performances from Janet Leigh, Anthony Perkins, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles.  But, as many other reviewers have noted, it was not the actors that made Psycho one of the pinnacles of cinema; it was Hitch himself.  His skillful use of lighting, effects, editing, and camera work have never been evidenced better than here.  Hitchcock's magic was that he could take such a horrific story and make it so beautiful that you the viewer are entranced by it, not able to wrest yourself away for any reason. Psycho is the only movie I've ever seen that grows scarier each time I watch.  The titles are a work of art in and of themselves, the photography is absolutely amazing, and Anthony Perkins's subtle, nuanced portrayal of Norman will almost have you rooting for him.  Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho is truly a classic in every sense of the word, and in every sense of the film to which it can be applied."
MovieMarauder,"Apr 18, 2000",10/10,"Three years ago at the tender age of thirteen, I watched this great film, and loved it from beginning to end!  Not only does it sport a fantastic cast of old character actors (Vera Miles, Jeanette Nolan, Martin Balsam etc.), but the classic, instantly recognizable, scissor-like score is one of Bernard Herrmann's best since his days with CBS, composing for Rod Serling's the Twilight Zone!  You must see this film, especially if your an old-film nut like me."
uffe-5,"Oct 24, 1999",10/10,"**Please excuse me for some spelling mistakes**This is the BEST HORROR/THRILLER/SCARY MOVIE IN THE WORLD! I just love this movie! Since I am a true movielover I do not mind that it is in black and white at all. The actors were great and still today it is a bit creepy when the thievish Marion Crane chooses the wrong place to spend the night on (and the wrong shower, ha ha ha). Perkins is SO perfect as Norman Bates and the voice of mother really made me shiver. The movie is filled with classic lines that I won't forget even if I'll isolate myself for 20 years. For those who can't stand old movies, or are'nt any real movielovers this will be a sleeping pill. But for us with a good taste it will be a very good experience. Don't get me wrong, i mean ''The Blair Witch project'' for example is scarier than ''Psycho'' but ''Psycho'' is creepier and better than any other thriller!Watch out for the remake from 1998, it really sucks!!!!!!10 out of 10 OF COURSE!!!!!!!!"
mcca-62051,"Oct 20, 2020",9/10,"Its one of those movies that is by far one of the best of all times. The story is exceptional. The acting is wonderful. The sick and craziness of the theory of Norman Bates is awesome. It takes the genre of Horror and Suspense to whole different level. Perkins made Norman more than a character. Hitchcock delivered a Masterpiece that many would try compare to, but can't."
Chuckles-6,"Sep 16, 1998",9/10,Alfred Hitchcock is still my favorite director and with Psycho he proved that a great director can make a great film for less than one million dollars. The shower scene could be the greatest scene ever put down on film. Everyone puts in 100%. From Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's chilling all string score Psycho can never be remade.
papjimbob,"Nov 5, 2005",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock takes over an hour and a half in his movie masterpiece, Psycho, to set up the audience for the dénouement scene, i.e. the scene in which Norman Bates' mother first reveals herself. The truth about her is so unexpected that it startles the first-time viewer into immediate and involuntary contemplation concerning the nature of the relationship between her and Norman.The first-time viewer is virtually coerced by Hitchcock to start thinking and theorizing in order to satisfy the viewer's own inherent need to make sense out of what is happening in the movie. It is reminiscent of some of William Faulkner's best work, in that it conjures up all sorts of unshown images in one's mind.The most amazing aspect of this great movie consists of its utter believability from beginning to end. These bizarre events could all really have happened! Go see this movie on the big screen. Don't talk to anyone who has seen it about its many secrets. You are best advised to discover those secrets for yourself, in due course. You will be artfully manipulated and mesmerized by the unexcelled genius of Alfred Hitchcock, in a way that is only rivaled by the likes of the great Orson Wells.If you have heart trouble, don't go to this movie. Although the movie really is wonderful, it's not quite worth dying for. Really."
DzeFrenchman,"Feb 2, 2011",6/10,"I agree with the fact that it has been of (most) importance for the movie industry because of some new elements it introduced. But besides that and the good directing, it totally lacks of brilliance. The actors were OK, but not worthy of all the praise they were given for it... Just take a look at what they have achieved in life: Anthony Perkins: 1 Oscar nomination (for supporting role), Janet Leigh: 1 Oscar nomination (for Psycho, which tells us a lot), and I won't even mention Vera Miles simply because there is nothing to mention. These are no great actors, not in any other movies, and neither in Psycho. Then we come to the story, the part of the film I really did not like. There's simply nothing brilliant about it, it's merely a plain story. Also, it was a little too obvious, referring to the fact that Norman's mother was already dead. This should have been worked out better, just like the shower scene. OK, the idea was brilliant, but I just can't believe, even back in 1960, that people find this shocking. It was such a let-down, I had expected so much more of this scene... It really looked like a big comedy. I know that many of the Psycho fans will disagree with my opinion, but let me just quote Hitchcock to add force to my opinion: ""To me Psycho was a big comedy. Had to be."" Then I wondered, how come it still has become a classic? Well, allow me to again quote Hitchcock: ""Even my failures make money and become classics a year after I make them."""
drewberiou,"Aug 3, 2023",10/10,"This movie is a classic for a reason. The lack of special effects, CGI and stuff used in movies now does not stop 'Psycho' from sending a chill down the spine. Unlike movies like 'The Exorcist' that relies on swearing, disfigured face and the infamous pea-soup vomit (which, by the way, makes the movie much less scary when watched today, but it is understandable why it was such a classic horror flick in its day) to produce its scares, 'Psycho' relies on its actors and their performance - which is why it still holds up today. There isn't a single boring or unwanted scene, and the plot is fast-paced enough to hold our attention, and at the same time, not overwhelmingly so. This is a movie that still remains a classic even though sixty-odd years have passed since its release. It deserves at least one watch and won't be boring even if you re-watch it."
moonspinner55,"Oct 26, 2005",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock has no sympathy for the victims in ""Psycho"", and he views them dispassionately. This relatively low-budget film is in silvery black-and-white, eerie and beautiful, with gliding camera-work and clever production touches which warrant repeat viewings, however it is much too merciless towards its characters to be a black comedy. It's also not much of a murder-mystery (we have an early idea of what's going on), yet the suspense in the third act is mounted with cunning precision. Mostly, Hitchcock seems curiously fascinated with plot-exposition and details, although the picture is still quite chilling. Anthony Perkins' tightly-controlled performance as Norman Bates is hypnotizing: his boyish good looks can be taken either way--gangly or crazily disconnected--and his eyes, which are frantic, dart around like an impatient child's (it's the role of a lifetime). I didn't much care for Simon Oakland's psychology report at the end, but the final shots and the voice-over are masterfully pulled-off. *** from ****"
geniusatwork-1,"Aug 17, 2006",1/10,"When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Billy Wilder and Orson Welles are much better directors, in my opinion. Sorry for my English. I'm from Russia."

The ultimate thriller, and the movie that created the template for slasher-horror movies.Solid plot, but the genius behind this is Alfred Hitchcock's direction. Hitchcock builds the tension and constantly keeps you on your toes. His use of camera angles is superb. This, all while keeping the movie moving along at a brisk pace. At no stage does it drift, or get bogged down.Hitchcock is aided by some excellent performances. Anthony Perkins is calculating menace personified as Norman Bates. Janet Leigh shines and deserved her Oscar nomination.Truly a classic, and one of the greatest movies of all time."
planktonrules,"Oct 24, 2024",10/10,"I was fortunate that the local film society had a viewing of PSYCHO on the big screen. I'd seen it on TV a couple times...I liked it but didn't love it. However, on the big screen it really comes into its own....with amazing black & white cinematorgraphy (the angles and lighting are exceptional). It still isn't quite as good as the cinematography in THE THIRD MAN...but it is close!While I could summarize the film and write a lengthy review about what I liked, I won't. After all, there are over 1600 reviews! But I did think it's about as good a Hitchcock film as you'll ever find.By the way, if you like the film, try finding PEEPING TOM. It's very similar and, perhaps, a bit better! Unfortunately for the filmmakers, however, PEEPING TOM was found so disturbing that it was banned in many places! Today, it doesn't seem overly violent or depraved...just brilliant."
reedmilder,"Mar 2, 2001",10/10,"Although it is extremely difficult to pick a single film as one's favorite, this would be my pick if I were forced to choose.  No, it is not because it is the most shocking or original film ever made (as if there could be).  In 40 years, the film has lost much of what made it revolutionary in 1960.  It is simply a fantastic screenplay that keeps me on the edge of my seat at all times.This is Hitchcock's best work as a director in my opinion.  Though he rarely made a bad film, most of Hitch's films are commercially-directed. I think of North By Northwest, Suspicion, Notorious and The Man Who Knew Too Much as examples.  Though each is a fantastic film, they are not terribly stimulating too watch and have minimal artistic merit.  Psycho, by contrast, is a true work of art.  No one could have expected it to be a hit at the time and was a great departure from Hitch's 1950s films.  There are no Cary Grants or Jimmy Stewarts here.  Just minor stars like Anthony Perkins and Martin Balsam.The two aspects of Psycho that set it apart are its cinematography and score.  There are no panoramic views typical of great cinematographic works. In fact, the whole film has the feel of a B movie.  One need only watch the famous shower scene to understand what I am talking about.  It is perhaps the most breathtaking 2 minutes ever put to film.  Hitch's close up shot of Marion's eye is still jolting today.  Imagine watching the scene on the big screen in 1960!  I guess what truly sets this film apart is the score. Perhaps no film is as tied to its score.  Bernard Herrmann may be the best there ever was at his profession.  His scores for Vertigo and Marnie are also top notch.Just watch this film.  If you've never seen it, it will provide a unique and surprising experience.  If you've already seen it, watch it again and enjoy Hitch at his best!  If you love Psycho as I do, check out Polanski's Repulsion, the French film Diabolique, and Hitch's first talkie Blackmail."

The direction is extremely original and credible and the adapted script is one of the most interesting, in that the main character within the movie fluctuates. I think this is a very interesting and clever idea which makes ""the shower scene"" more shocking. The music is also infinitely effective in creating atmosphere within the film. If you haven't seen this movie try not to find out too much about it - although I guess it's inevitable because it's a genuine classic.

witch king,"Oct 22, 1998",10/10,"The psychological threads of the film are so complex as to be nearly inexhaustible; this feature alone contributes to its place in film history as one of the great celluloid efforts of all time. Like any genuine work of true genius, it may be enjoyed on more than one level. Alfred Hitchcock forced film-goers to confront head-on just a few of the shadowy corners of the human psyche: the Oedipus/Elektra complexes, jealousy about sexual [or perceived sexual] rights, guilt, and self-hatred [as in Norman's cross-dresssing], to cite just a few examples of neurotic behavior. Perhaps the most frightening interpretation of the film is that one is responsible for one's actions and cannot, ever, alter the designated course a particular act has set in motion. Here, it is Marion Crane's decision to steal the $40 grand from her employer in order to race to Fairvale to be with her [illicit] lover, Sam Loomis. The opening vista, a bleak mountain and desert landscape over Phoenix [note the metaphor for both the geographical location and the town's name], is replete with the futility of the lovers ever forging a permanent bond with one another. The film is a terrific essay of human desperation and its stray threads: the hunger for sex, for a safe haven, for an ascendant place in one's tiny universe. The barrenness of the emotional landscape is shiveringly mirrored in Bernard Herrmann's shrill, spiky score, which speaks of the desolation of all humankind. Both murders are violent acts of mutilation and hatred, one thinks, not only for the victims, but also for the perpetrator. Fittingly, the killer's ""cleansing"" ritual takes place in a swamp, the normal repository for all kinds of secrets and unclean, dangerous organisms lurking beneath the stagnant surface. Finally, I found most interesting the title on the record label on the turntable in Norman's room: Beethoven's Eroica Symphony [No. 3]. This majestic, noble work bears no resemblance to the music one would justly associate with the tormented mind of young Bates. One can only guess that the boy's impressionable mind was at one time quite normal and receptive to elevated experiences such as a hearing of this great work of Beethoven's, but that jealousy, perhaps having been spurred by an intimacy with his mother, drove the boy to madness. Guilt, one of the human being's great purgatives, finds no outlet here, as we see in Norman's feral smile at the film's end. Hitchcock's use of mirrors works wonderful psychological tricks upon us, forcing us to wonder if what we see in our real and fancied mirrors, is real."
tasosk3,"Feb 21, 2000",10/10,"I watched this one last night for a third time. As always with Hitchcock's movies, this one looks better with every time. What more can I say that hasn't already been said? The direction is amazing (and very much ahead of its time), Bernard Herman's score is possibly the best piece of music written for a motion picture, a true work of art(and it's a pity there is not a soundtrack album out) and of course Perkins' performance is totally out of this world. And forget about the famous (and too much copied) shower scene, or the detective's murder; the most horrifying scene is the one at the end where Norman Bates sits alone, thinking  his mother's  thoughts, and then gives to the camera THAT look- it has me scared sh**less every time I see it. A true masterpiece."
salatiello,"Mar 4, 2001",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's crisp efficiency is not unlike that of Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), the dutiful son who cleans up after his mother in the landmark thriller ""Psycho.""  Not only is this a masterfully directed suspense chiller, it actually set standards by which all fright films since have been measured.  The cinema has produced some great scores, but Bernard Herrmann's music is incredibly enhancing and simply unforgettable, one of the best ever (and it did not even get an Oscar nomination for Best Score). The more I watch ""Psycho,"" the more I prefer the first half, with its sense of dread and a fascinatingly cool Janet Leigh (Oscar nomination for Best Supporting Actress). Hitchcock, of course, never won the Best Director Oscar, but was nominated for ""Psycho,"" one of 1960's biggest box-office hits.  Shockingly, Anthony Perkins, in a career-making role and one of the most famous performances in screen history, failed to win a Best Actor nomination -- probably because the performance was too edgy and disturbing (which is what made it great).  Some scenes are dated, of course, but this film almost never falters.  It gets a ""9"" (and a very high nine at that) from me."
Andreus3000,"Apr 7, 2018",9/10,"A seminal classic of horror by master Alfred Hitchcock, with some of the most memorable iconic scenes in the history of Cinema. Tense, horrific and a superb lesson in filmmaking, it offers well-constructed characters, a lot of revealing dialogue and a huge regard for details.
Hitchcock's classic ""comedy"" featuring the world's most famous mother's boy is one of the most influential films ever made; every serial killer and slasher movie owes something to this, one of the true greats of cinema."
dee.reid,"Jun 27, 2009",10/10,"I have to admit that I have a terrible habit of getting around to watching classic movies when it's really late in the game. I guess my excuse is that I'm only 23, and most of the so-called ""classic"" movies of the 20th century were made well before I was even born. I'm ashamed to say that I fell in love with both ""Jaws"" (1975) and ""Halloween"" (1978) just last year; this year, just about a half-hour ago, I had the great pleasure to see Alfred Hitchcock's classic 1960 suspense-thriller ""Psycho.""A lot has already been said about this film, so I won't comment too much on what it's actually about, and instead I'll only comment on significance and my reactions to it. ""Psycho"" has a plot based heavily in reality: adapted from the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch, the book and film were loosely based on the crimes of real-life Wisconsin serial killer Ed Gein. ""Psycho"" finds its story revolving around Marion Crane (the late Janet Leigh), a lowly Phoenix, Arizona, secretary who embezzles $40,000 from her boss and hits the road, later stopping in at the isolated Bates Motel, and meets the owner and sole employee of the establishment, Norman Bates (the late Anthony Perkins).The rest of the plot is well-known to anyone who has seen the film, so I won't describe it. Plus, to really describe the rest of the plot in any sort of detail at all will ruin the shocks and surprises that the film has in store for the viewer (most notoriously, the infamous ""shower scene,"" which has to be seen to be believed, and experienced). The ""shower scene"" itself is one of the chief reasons to see this picture; it's shocking, Bernard Herrmann's theme slices away at your eardrums, and it's one of the iconic death scenes - one of the most iconic scenes, period - in movie history.""Psycho"" is a phenomenal piece of film, from a master filmmaker and an equally talented cast and crew; it's a true cinematic landmark. Most importantly, and the reason why I now hold this film to the high degree that I do now, is that ""Psycho"" is partially (or is it entirely?) responsible for influencing entire generations of filmmakers, particularly those in the horror genre. ""Psycho"" has almost single-handedly influenced, and given rise to, the slasher sub-genre of horror, which of course gave rise to, and is populated by the likes of, Leatherface (from ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" series), Michael Myers (from the ""Halloween"" series), Jason Voorhees (from the ""Friday the 13th"" series), my personal favorite movie slasher Fred Krueger (from the ""Nightmare on Elm Street"" series), and countless other imitators. ""Psycho"" would itself become fodder for the slasher genre nearly two decades after its release, when it was followed up by three vastly inferior sequels, with Anthony Perkins reprising his signature role as Norman Bates in all three films.""Psycho"" has also been the subject of a lot of psychiatric and psychological analysis, for those interested in understanding the criminal mind and how it functions. As a criminal justice major in college, in my studies I've across several opportunities to study ""Psycho"" (but never did) and exactly how it influenced the slasher genre and why it's fascinated criminology experts in the decades since its release, thus having even greater influence outside of the film community and American pop culture.Alfred Hitchcock proved that he was a cinematic genius with ""Psycho,"" since I understand that it is arguably his best and most popular film. At least now I've finally had a chance to see a movie that I've heard so much about and never previously got the chance to watch.10/10"
valadas,"Aug 3, 2006",6/10,"I never was a great Hitchcock fan and this movie did nothing to change my mind. It's indisputable that he makes very good movies from the formal-technical point of view and that he knows how to create a suspense and (or) horror atmosphere with great mastery and skillfulness but the stories he tells us are too fanciful to be real (despite the fact that they are presented as real)and when he dives into the psychological pathology of his characters he becomes much unconvincing. For instance in this movie the psychiatrist's explanation which takes place in the final scene doesn't seem to me to have great scientific rigor, looking more like pure fantasy. Nevertheless it's true indeed that this movie (like others he has made) keeps us stuck to our seats and wrapped up in the story unfolding from the first to the last scene. Only later and after the movie ends do we emerge from that spell to realize that all that has very little juice in terms of psychological reality. This movie has however also a remarkable feature in the performance of the great actor who is Anthony Perkins who makes and excellent character very well adapted to the role that the movie's director gave him and with great and talented sobriety."
sergi-6,"Jan 4, 2001",6/10,"...the best of this film is, without no doubt, his music (by Bernard Herrmann, of course). I think that 'Psycho', like most of Hitchcock's films, is getting older and older. I suppose it was a hit on his era, but today..."
Movieman-133,"Jul 16, 1999",1/10,"Well,   what can I say about this film.   It's merely okay and the black and white makes the film seem completely dull and frankly quite boring.  I don't understand what all this talk about the color being artistic but I found it repulsive.   The acting in the movie was very mediocre, especially from the stiff John Gavin,   the ever so proper Vera Miles,  and the so serious Martin Balsam.   Try watching the new Psycho and you'll find that these characters can actually have personalities. As for Janet Leigh, well she was good,   but Anne Heche seemed more innocent,  more human,  and more sympathetic.   As for Anthony Perkins,    he's also so monotone, barely ANY emotion,   and I struggle to understand why people rave over his dry performance.  As for the ""mother twist"",  well that was good but there are twists in about every horror film now a days and they are usually more entertaining than this joke. And then there is the shower scene which everyone says is so scary?  Where have they been ,  I could pick out a dream sequence from any A Nightmare on Elm Street sequel that was done more creatively and powerfully.  It was a simple knifing in the shower for god's sake,   isn't watching the opening of Drew Barrymore in Scream ten times more chilling and exciting? Give me a break,  when I went to Universal Studious they said the shower sequence was one of the most famous scenes of all time.  Well,  give an audience an opportunity to watch either that or the astonishing death of Piper Laurie in Depalma's Carrie,  or the thrill of the finale chase in Halloween,  and well see what brings more reactionary emotion of the audience.  Well,  what can I say about a movie that I will never understand?  When people made the new Psycho some thought it was stupid because of the story--and so I know I'm not alone.   It's just that these old foggies are so hung up on old movies that they are blind to see that modern movies provide for much more entertainment.    Some old horror films like Rosemary's Baby are excellent,  but this is not.  As for Bernard Herrmann score,   it's overplayed,   can't he think of anything new to compose? Compare Pino Donnagio' lush score from Carrie opposed to this and see what's more creative and effective.  What can I say besides people, this movie is simply average and that it might of have been good back then, but it's simply OK now.  Do we still rave about the type writer just because it was original back then?  I have spoken and I guess that Blockbuster Video agrees with me that the movie is too much of a joke to be placed in the horror section.  It's in the Drama suspense category,  and certainly a thrilless and dated film to belong anywhere else.  Psycho remains as the most overrated film of all time and the new Psycho is a much better improvement."
Herb-Mitchell-Reviewed,"Apr 26, 2019",N/A,Anthony Perkins characters monologue was psychopathic but psychotically endearing.
TheClapper,"Nov 22, 2014",9/10,"The strings of Bernard Herrmann combined with the screams of Janet Leigh, the knife of Norman Bates and the cuts of Alfred Hitchcock makes the movie moment that penetrated pop culture like no other.My impression is that Psycho is perceived as purely a great piece of craft and entertainment, but in my mind what makes Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho such a singular work is the deep and personal poetry it contains.Hitchcock was completely fearless in his ideas at this point. He makes his most radical and innovative film. The movie is heightened from his famous thrillers to a pure and modern horror movie. The visual universe is now dirty and grim as opposed to beautiful and glamorized. The icy and sophisticated blonds are gone and there are no traces of sympathetic heroes.Everyone who has seen an interview with Alfred Hitchcock knows that he hides behind an inflated and parodic character. In his interviews he is very secretive and doesn't revel anything about himself. The opposite is true in his films. In his movies he is often completely open and naked. He exposes the most shameful truths about himself and his life. In Psycho he does a personal examination on a level beyond anything I've ever seen. He puts himself in the space where he is the most vulnerable. He offers a ""peeping hole"" into the darkest corners of his personality. The movie is extremely revealing, but in very subtle ways. One has to work to find the treasures of Psycho.Psycho is like a novel in the way images are often suggested and has to be completed in the heads of the audience. The sexual and violent scenes are never explicit. This makes the movie even more disturbing than it ever could be if we had seen the images, and this was also the only way Hitchcock could convey what he wanted to convey and still get past the ridiculously strict American censorship laws of the time.Sexuality is always a theme in a Hitchcock movie, but he never explored it as profoundly or intimately as he did in Psycho. The shower scene for example feels like a rape as much as it does a murder(the feeling intrusion, the nakedness and so on). Norman desperately desires Marion Crane. He is sexually satisfied by killing her(it might be a stretch, but I see the knife as a symbol of the male sex organ). This scene is all about the childish shame of Normans sexuality. Norman, or the mother side of him, tries to suppress his sexuality completely. This is one of the examples of the openness of Hitchcock in this movie. His catholic upbringing would suggest a lot of shameful sexuality in his life as well. Something he has in common with his biggest contemporary director hero, Luis Bunuel. Bunuel are one of very few directors who explored his own sexuality with anything close to the amount of honesty of Psycho.Psycho is such a rich movie. It is filled with details. I believe you could watch it fifty times over and still find something new the fifty first time you watch it. Pay for example attention to all the little symbols and metaphors scatterd all over every single frame. Notice all the fascinations or ""fetishes"" of Hitchcocks that he put into it. The stuffed birds and the way they mirror Normans mother. The way food and eating connects with murder and sex. The peeping hole as a symbol for voyeurism and the movie camera. The cellar as a symbol of the suppressed and the shameful truths about Norman Bates. I really want to go into all these details, but like I said, there are too many and too much to discuss. It wont fit into the format of an IMDb review...If you don't see the same things I do in this movie, please watch it again. Even more than the magnificent ""Vertigo"" Psycho has the ability to grow immensely on a second viewing, and continue to grow on the third, fourth, fifth, sixth... In my heart it has grown to be one of the absolute best films in movie history."
Zycho-3,"Aug 18, 2000",10/10,"The first time I saw Psycho, I watched the first 20 minutes and stopped the tape. I thought it was boring. But, alas, I rented it again a few weeks ago and I didn't like it. Didn't like it at all. I bloody loved it! Psycho is a freakin' masterpiece! It is easily Alfred Hitchcock's best film, and it is definitely an unforgettable chilling classic. Anthony Perkins was brilliant as Norman Bates, I will certainly look out for more of his work in the coming months. Janet Leigh was also very impressive, she was a real gem of Psycho.So, don't make the same mistake I did, watch this classic today, and I guarantee you'll never forget it.Rating: 10"
hitch1960,"Nov 22, 2000",10/10,"Films like Psycho should be remembered throughout history.  A work of technical and psychological brilliance, I am stunned that someone could find this film boring and not frightening.  This was undoubtedly the scariest movie ever made.  Only Hitchcock could make this film a classic. With only two murders, it is infinitely scarier than any of these slasher films with a murder every two seconds.  This movie was not about the murders, although that was what you were lead to believe by the first murder.  This film was, for lack of a better term, a horrifying character study.  This film will go down in history and be remembered forever for it.  It should never have been remade, and one can only hope that perhaps someday they will re-release it into theaters."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 29, 2013",9/10,"Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) steals $40k from work, and runs away. In a stormy night, she stops at the isolated Bates Motel where she meets creepy Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins).This one has Alfred Hitchcock as the master salesman. It's the biggest show in show business, and he's the master of ceremony. He pulls out all the stops like the secrecy and the refusal of entry to late arrivals. It helps to have the most iconic movie scene of all times.Janet Leigh isn't just a damsel in distress or a shrinking violet. She is a woman with a dark side. The fact that she's an A-list star used to mean that she'll last until the end of the movie. When the super creepy Anthony Perkins joins her, it was set up for a prolong creepfest. Then comes the most well made important scene in history. The second half does have a little struggle to reclimb that peak, and I didn't like all the pontificating at the end. But those are tiny problems in a great movie."
hellorutik,"Aug 11, 2022",7/10,Ok i know this movie came out way long time ago in 60s and that makes it a great movie of that time. But I watched it in 2022. And i have watched more better movies that were made after that. Hitchcock started it and it only got better. It's a good watch. But not the greatest. I have seen better psycho killer thrillers.
plato-11,"Dec 28, 1999",10/10,"I love this movie! I've literally watched it hundreds of times, and every time I notice something new. Tony Perkins gives his best performance as Norman Bates. All of the other performers do a great job as well. This is my absolute favorite movie. It still has the ability to shock people today, which is a testament to its power. The shower scene is one of the most effective murder scenes I have seen, all without actually showing the knife penetrating the skin. That just goes to show that today's slasher movies are going about scaring people the wrong way.This is a movie that is impossible to become bored with, no matter how many times you have watched it. This is Alfred Hitchcock's best film."
halfbloodprince777,"Jun 4, 2019",6/10,"Well the plot is pretty simple and straightforward. There is nothing horror/scary about the movie. Maybe it was a good movie in 1960. But it doesn't live up to its hype for the present generation.
The good thing about the movie was its climax. Though Anthony Perkins didn't seem to be scary throughout the movie...only after the revelation about the murders (trying to avoid spoilers) , his face was way too scarier. Even when I think of him , it is really scary."
thisisaj-2,"Oct 27, 2000",4/10,"I watched Psycho for my Perspectives on Popular Culture, and I was not impressed at all by the shower scene.  The one thing that was really intriguing was the character of Norman Bates, who would make an interesting study in probably any field. I guess what made me dislike Psycho is that I knew the plot ahead of time. I bet that if I saw this film in 1960 I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It reminded me a little of the Sixth Sense, another psychological thriller.L.R."
treacle,"Oct 8, 1998",N/A,"Psycho is a timeless classic. I am teaching it to a class of sixteen year old students and they love it. Even though horror films these days may have more immediate impact, my students have said that the film lingers long in the memory afterwards. It has made an impression on them and I think that that is the highest compliment that can be paid to this great film."
Jonny_Numb,"Nov 6, 2006",9/10,"Strange what the passage of time can do to a film. I remember seeing portions of ""Psycho"" when I was very young on local TV; when our household became cable-ready a few years later and AMC showed actual movie classics, Hitchcock's film was regular on the rotation. I remember being shocked and impressed by Janet Leigh's shower demise and Martin Balsam's staircase tumble, but not too wild about the actual narrative. When you're less than 10 years old, you take for granted a lot of the nuances of film-making that only make sense when you're older.And ""Psycho"" is almost entirely nuance and technique. From Anthony Perkins' legendary performance as the quiver-lipped, boyish Norman Bates to Bernard Herrmann's piercingly authorative, all-strings score to Hitchcock's intersection of characters (where misunderstandings and misplaced responsibility are the norm), the film is a masterful blend of all the elements that make for quality cinema. And for all its pop-culture influence (as it was one of the first 'psychological horrors' put on screen), ""Psycho"" remains extremely subtle and surprising, even if you know all the plot turns in advance.See Marion. See Marion embezzle $44 grand from her boss. See Marion on the run from her own guilt. See Marion make a fateful stop at the Bates Motel. See Norman. See Norman talk about his abusive, domineering mother... (I needn't go any further.)Since there is really no creative way to write about a film that has already been so extensively written on, I offer some of my personal favorite moments: The head-on shots of Marion (Janet Leigh) driving away from responsibility, listening to dialogues taking place far away, her facial expressions our only indicator of emotion. The judgmental look of the used-car salesman. The way Norman leans his head forward in the parlor, becoming somber and defensive over the word 'someplace.' The shriek of strings as the shower curtain is pulled back. Norman's awkward reaction to Private Investigator Arbogast (Martin Balsam)'s casual questioning. Arbogast's oblivious, seemingly slow-motion ascent of the staircase. Mrs. Bates' closing monologue, delivered in an acrid voice whose tone will literally make your skin crawl.And there's a lot more. As much as it's been said already, I will have to concur that ""Psycho"" is probably Hitchcock's masterpiece (I haven't seen all of his films), a near-seamless blend of story, character, irony, and technique."

xander34,"Oct 29, 2007",7/10,"Reviewing Alfred Hitchcock's famed black and white opus Psycho from a 21st century perspective gives the film less credit than it deserves. For it's time, it was revolutionary. Now, it is just a well acted, yet somewhat dated horror film. The editing in the shower scene has become a cliché in pop culture, but one cannot deny the original brilliance of the scene. The movie really only works as well as it does because of the performances of Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins. Perkins never really had another role he was better in, save Mike Nichols' Catch-22, a personal favorite. After Hitchcock died, he later starred and directed in numerous Psycho sequels before Perkins' eventual death. Hitchcock's killing of Leigh at the onset is also quite ground-breaking. It was mirrored in Wes Craven's Scream with the Drew Barrymore character, as well as in many other pictures.Psycho also created the character of Dr. Sam Loomis, a name later used in the other revolutionary horror film, John Carpenter's Halloween. Overall, the movie doesn't age as horrible as some other select black and white 50's-60's horror films, but nevertheless it does age a reasonable amount, leading to many cringe worthy and laughable scenes, most likely due lackluster performances by the rest of the cast, low production values, and shady effects and ""skeletons."""
laurenspierre,"Dec 22, 2023",10/10,"""Well, a son is a poor substitute for a lover.""Have to bump this one up to 5 stars. After this rewatch, as part of my ongoing Hitchcock marathon, I can now confidently say that Psycho is my favorite film of the master and that it sits firmly in my top 20 films of all time. The number of memorable quotes, indelible images and iconic scenes is quite frankly insane (wink, wink), and yet, Psycho amounts to more than the sum of its exquisite parts.There really is no other film like it, from the unique way it is structured, to its visual inventiveness, and the complex psychology of it. Indeed, Psycho's bold and successful experimentation when it comes to both the arts of storytelling and filmmaking must be applauded. However, this is not just an ""important"" film, merely a piece of academia to be studied by film scholars. The reason these creative visual techniques and the revolutionary story structure are still studied after all these years is, after all, because THEY WORK. So even if you don't care about actively analyzing Hitchcock's technical and narrative innovations, Psycho will still take you on a cinematic joyride, as it is just an utterly engrossing and immensely entertaining film.The synopsis of the film: Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) embezzles 40k from a rich client at the bank where she works and subsequently goes on the run with it. This is, of course, the greatest red herring in the history of cinema. Everything that's going on with the cop following her and the used car salesman, then the storm hitting, checking in at the Bates Motel and Marion's drawn-out conversation with Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), which then seems to make her change her mind. Through this meticulous, slow build-up, Hitchcock demands our full investment in Marion's predicament, but of course, none of that matters anymore after THE SCENE.The shower scene in Psycho. Probably one of the most well-known (and most referenced) scenes in film history, and I got nothing to add. The screeching violins and the quick editing, conspiring to make every 'film cut' feel like a 'knife cut', it's just so very, very good. I can't imagine what it must have been like to see this in theaters in 1960 (which goes for the whole film really).The subsequent scene, while not as iconic and formally inventive, is just as effective in conveying some crucial story and character elements. As we see Norman methodically cleaning up the mess, his mind racing while still acting calm and collected, we realize he's been here before. In a minutes-long wordless sequence, we get to see every painstaking detail of the cover-up, up until the dissolution of the car in the swamp (another great visual moment), and it all feels oddly satisfying. On an unrelated note, I feel like Vince Gilligan must have watched that scene A LOT, because it reminded me of those extended wordless set pieces he used to create in Breaking Bad/Better Call Saul, where we just watch men at work, usually executing some complicated scheme, the intricate details of which are only slowly revealed to us.Back to Psycho. It's as if another film begins during that clean-up scene, as the story definitively shifts from Marion Crane to the film's real protagonist, Norman Bates. We realize now that we have been taken for a ride by that sly Mr. Hitchcock with the whole money theft storyline, as the true crux of the film slowly comes into focus: what is going on with Norman Bates? What about that domineering mother? What other unspeakable events have taken place in that motel and in that large gothic house towering over it? The answers are more horrifying than we could have imagined, revealed (partly) during the masterful climactic sequence, through some memorably ghoulish imagery.My only small gripe with this film upon first viewing was the part right after that, with the psychiatrist explaining everything we just saw at a rapid-fire pace, as if he was tasked with wrapping up the film in a couple of minutes. This time around, the exposition dump didn't even bother me, because A) although it still feels like a somewhat clunky bit of storytelling, I also feel the explanation is necessary to fully unpack the film's final twist and its inherent complex psychology and B) I knew what was still coming: one final high note to end the film on. And sure enough, we get that deranged voice-over as the camera slowly zooms in on Norman's/Mother's face. One final lurid image to be imprinted on the viewer's mind, with Norman's creepy face and smile superimposed on Mother's skull.Anthony Perkins' portrayal of Norman Bates is, of course, another key to the success of this film. I truly believe he gives one of the great performances of all time here. He imbues what could have been a stereotypical 'horror movie villain' with creepiness, charm, vulnerability, intelligence, loneliness and desire, all at once.Obviously, there is so much to unpack psychologically with this film, it makes your head hurt. Once Norman Bates' true nature is revealed, the murder retro-actively becomes an incredibly layered act: on a surface level, it is of course Norman killing Marion, with the act of murder possibly being a metaphor for rape (Norman is clearly shown to be attracted to Marion physically). But as explained by the psychiatrist, it is in fact Mother taking over, triggered by Norman's arousal and (sexual) desire, and it is really her who kills Marion. Finally, I felt as if it was also Norman killing Mother (again), represented by Marion, as she is also having an affair with a married man (surely this is no coincidence). I won't dive into any more of the complex psychology at play with Norman Bates, as this character is already one of the most studied subjects in 'Psychoanalysis' (pun very much intended).One could say that Psycho invented 'elevated horror' before horror itself even existed as a real genre. In addition to having a complex and layered main character, the film boasts a stunning cinematography and maintains a tense atmosphere throughout, while relying on prolific visual techniques to evoke visceral reactions from the audience. Today, that's basically what we would refer to as 'elevated horror'.In conclusion, Psycho is one of my favorite films and a landmark in the history of cinema. If Hitchcock's radical formal inventiveness alone isn't enough to ensure it of that status, consider that Psycho remains one of the most daringly creative films of the 20th century on a narrative level as well, in the way it so boldly broke the established conventions around story structure and incorporated complex psychology into a 'simple horror story'. Not to mention its 'killer twist'. Finally, add to that Bernard Herrmann's iconic score (I can't believe I almost neglected to mention the film's legendary music in this already overlong review!) and an all-time great 'horror villain' (albeit an unconventional one) performance by Anthony Perkins and you have, with Psycho, not only one of the most influential films of all time, but also a film that still holds up today as one of the best ever made."

fullthundermoon-36564,"Nov 18, 2021",10/10,"A day in the life of Marion Crane is expertly documented. Note every detail, every nuance, everywhere. Marion' morning is humdrum. Everything then changes - in an impulsive decision. Then, the game of consequence begins and ends in a living nightmare. Yet, Hitch manages to distort time and reality. The audience imagines Leigh is only on screen for a few minutes. Musical score is phenomenal."
akarobo,"Jan 8, 2025",10/10,"For me, Psycho is the perfect movie from start to finish. While it's by no means Alfred Hitchcock's best work, it undeniably stands as one of the greatest films of all time. From the title alone, the viewer is drawn into a web of intrigue-who is the ""psycho""? First, we suspect Marion Crane, then the ominous cop, and so on, as Hitchcock masterfully leads us down one false trail after another. The shocking twist ending remains one of the creepiest and most perfectly crafted in cinema history. This film didn't just captivate me; it made me fall in love with cinema and the timeless allure of classic films."

truemythmedia,"Jan 30, 2020",10/10,"""Psycho"" is a masterpiece of both filmmaking and storytelling, and it's also probably one of the most influential films ever made (no hyperbole needed). While Alfred Hitchcock's career is stuffed to the gills with thrilling, horrific stories (""Frenzy"", ""The Birds"") and intriguing mysteries (""Vertigo"", ""Rope""), this film is sort of the best of both worlds; it starts off as one thing and morphs into something entirely different. ""Psycho"" has some of the best subversions of expectations I've seen brought to screen, and that's only looking at this movie from a storytelling standpoint; from a filmmaking standpoint, this film is a technical marvel, and that infamous shower scene is to this day being touted as one of the best edited minutes of cinema history (if you've got the time, check out the documentary ""78/52""- about the seventy-eight setups and fifty-two cuts used in the scene). This is my personal favorite of Hitch's films, and I think it's also the best thing he ever made (sorry ""Vertigo"", ""Notorious"", ""Rear Window"", ""North By Northwest"", and ""Rebecca"")."
RickBrands,"Nov 27, 2010",7/10,"While I know I'll anger a lot of thriller fans, here's my two cents: this is one of the least enjoyable Hitchcock classics. To clarify: if you compare Psycho to North by Northwest, Strangers on a Train, Vertigo or Rebecca, I can't see how any self-proclaimed film fan wouldn't conclude that it falls considerably short. Even other Hitch classics I don't particularly love or hate (such as The Birds, Rear Window or Marnie) trigger a wider emotional response than the pretty simplistic shock effects which are all Psycho has to offer. Of course there's some great cinematography, but it isn't backed by any involving factors other than sheer horror, or the kind of hammy pseudo-psychology Hitchcock already tried his hand on in Spellbound.My reasonably kind rating of seven out of ten is mostly motivated by its historical importance - even if you take into account that Peeping Tom, which I think is a far superior film with a similar theme, relentlessly flopped earlier in the same year - as it opened the mainstream public's eyes regarding the horror/thriller genre. But if you've seen Psycho once (which, in fact, any film fanatic should), to me there's no real reason to watch it again."
stryker-5,"Dec 30, 2000",N/A,"A respectable 30-year-old spinster steals $40,000 from her workplace and takes off on a solo car journey to nowhere.  She makes the fateful mistake of staying overnight at the Bates Motel ...There is a difference between a great film, where the cast and technicians seem inspired and the project is carried along on the energy of its ideas, and a merely good film, in which the cleverness is calculated, and the tricks are consciously inserted.  ""Psycho"" is merely a good film.But what cleverness!  The incidental music of Bernard Herrman, Hitchcock's composer of choice, has a discordant, staccato leitmotif in the strings which repeats constantly, building almost hypnotically towards the shrill climax of the shower scene.  Hitchcock deploys a battery of subtle devices to keep the viewer feeling vaguely uneasy.  Sexual frankness was a shocking thing in a mainstream movie in 1960, and the opening scene (showing Marion's ""extended lunch hour"" with Sam) is so sexually honest that it cannot have failed to disturb contemporary cinema audiences.  Faces are lit from below or the side, creating an inchoate sense of foreboding.  Owls and ravens, traditional omens of evil, preside silently over Norman's parlour. The windshield wiper which fails to clear the rain is a symbol of Marion's guilty conscience.The film's abiding mood is one of creepy uneasiness, and this is reinforced at every turn by Hitchcock's system of visual imagery.  There is, of course, the Old Dark House, but far less obvious techniques are also at work.  As Arbogast mounts the stairs, the camera retreats disconcertingly before him.  The tines of the rakes in Sam's store are raised like bony, clutching fingers behind Lila's head.  Marion's unblinking eyeball is compositionally echoed by the circular plughole, the water draining out as her life force ebbs away.In the long dialogue scene between Norman and Marion (""We all go a little mad sometimes""), the rhythm of the cutting is exquisite.  Sometimes we see the speaker, sometimes the listener, as the rapidity of the cuts forms a counterpoint to the text, and emphasises the discomfort of the characters (Marion wary but self-possessed, Norman outwardly affable but painfully shy).The cinematic axiom, ""Show it, don't tell it"", is beautifully illustrated in the scene in Marion's bedroom.  The camera closes in on the bundles of banknotes lying on the bed, then pans to the packed suitcase, telling us without the need for words that she has decided to take the money and run.Then something puzzling happens.  The film seems to lose all belief in its own precepts, and the rich visual symbolism is abruptly abandoned.  Lila opines, ""I'll feel better when all this is explained,"" but she is wrong. The explanation is a huge let-down.  We get Dr. Simon, a psychiatrist, lecturing us at tedious length about Norman's condition.  ""Show it, don't tell it"" flies out of the window.  Maybe Stefano, the scriptwriter, realised that the running time was already over two hours and the thing needed its loose ends tied up rapidly.  Perhaps the flat, prosaic ending is the price Hitch has to pay for the slow painstaking build-up in the early reels (it is almost half an hour before Norman makes it onto the screen).  Whatever the reason, I for one found the closing section very disappointing."
mbhgkmsgg,"Oct 27, 2020",10/10,"Where do you even begin with a film like Psycho. Everything about it is so masterfully done that there is very little that can be said. In addition, anything that could be said has already been said by others. Regardless, I will now tell you how I feel about Psycho and why I think that it is one of the best movies I have ever seen.Where this movie really shines, is in building tension. Not a single scene or moment goes by where you aren't kept wondering what's going to happen and how it's going to happen. As soon as Marion leaves in her car, the tension starts to build. And not until the words, 'The End', appear on the screen, does that tension ease. There are, of course, stand out scenes, such as the infamous shower scene, or the staircase scene with Arbogast. However, what to me is even more impressive, is Hitchcock's ability to keep the viewer on the edge of the seat for the entire run time.Everything about this film is simply sublime. The music, the sound effects, the acting (especially Anthony Perkins as Bates), the locations, and perhaps most importantly, the pacing. The steady stream of clues and new mysteries keep you guessing throughout the film, making sure that there isn't a dull moment.If you haven't seen Psycho already, make sure you do. It is one of those rare films where I can't think of anything to change or add. And to be completely honest with you, I believe, as do many others, that this is one of the finest pieces of cinema ever created."

BeegYoshi69,"Dec 30, 2024",10/10,"Yeah yeah, it's as great as everyone says it is. This is my first experience with Hitchcock aside from a inattentive viewing of Rear Window a few years ago. This really has encouraged me to check out his other work now. He directs scenes so excellently, and is yes a ""master of suspense."" I won't go on anymore, I mean what more can I really add to the discussion of a film as revolutionary as Psycho? Glad that after so many years I finally got around to watching it. I'm thinking about giving the sequels a viewing. I'm also thinking about not taking showers anymore and start taking baths. Just kidding!"
mathhater4life,"Nov 17, 2001",7/10,"What made me love this movie was Norman Bates. He seemed like a such a nice every-day type guy...that just so happens to be psychotic and stab people in their showers. Janet Leigh (who is a much better actress than her daughter) was a great choice for her character. On the other hand, I really hated the whiny girl they cast as her sister. What made psycho work as a thriller/ horror phenonemon was the way it was marketed..because, let's face it--the shower scene isn't THAT scary. The reason why its so memorable is because of the way it shocked people who didn't know what to expect. I mean if you watch the old trailers, it doesn't give away much. So Psycho really should go down in history as a classic."
Paul216,"Dec 26, 2024",10/10,"Everyone needs love, respect and acceptance from others, and once this requirement is not met, the mind will be distorted and people will go to the opposite side. Many psychologists believe that being loved is a basic need, and that the ability to love is one of the criteria by which a normal person can judge. This is important in Freud's and Rogers's teachings. Rogers believes that we all have a natural need to be accepted and respected, and that when the satisfaction of such a request is conditioned, it often causes us to involuntarily meet such conditions in order to maintain the respect of important others. At this time, we tend to see ourselves and act from the perspective of others, and instead of listening to the guidance of our own inner experience, we become more and more a product of social consciousness, and this is the origin of various mental diseases."
jldmp1,"Apr 17, 2006",7/10,"Hitchcock declares up front that we're going to be on the edge of our seats while he has us captive. The music is shrill, obsessive.We float in through the window on two lovers breaking up. A tailing police cruiser drifts out of the rear glass while we watch the girl watching her mirror. The camera floats out of the girl's dead eye, pulls back on her face frozen in fear, it swings around, pulls in on the newspaper, then swings away to the haunted madhouse on the hill. It levitates up the staircase, focuses on the 'conversation' in the next room, backs away and upwards and views the hallway straight down, all in one movement...a more impressive minute than the entire contents of many other movies.Required film school viewing, absolutely. But also for us more casual viewers, this is a key movie we all need for understanding where visual vocabularies come from.The later borrowings from this are uncountable. The most literal borrowing from the shower scene is in the ""Raging Bull"" Lamotta/Robinson bout, matching the cuts from angle to angle and in the same rhythm.Brilliant vision and music, medium story and acting, though Perkins made every tic and stutter count."
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Aug 1, 2007",1/10,"After having heard all the noise surrounding this film,I decided to watch this film as I had to give a presentation of a Stephen Rebello's book based on this film for my teacher Monsieur François Thomas at Cinema studies section of the University of Paris 3 Sorbonne Nouvelle. I was utterly disappointed as this film was not so chilling as I had expected it to be.Psycho is more of a character study of some oddball persons.In the beginning Hitchcock takes us on a guilt trip of a woman who is in love with a married man.Funny thing is that both of them know that they cannot find any happiness in their so called secret love.Later on we are taken for a ride as this bizarre woman steals a lot of money and without any rhyme nor reason decided to leave her hometown.Now everybody knows what happens after that.Psycho is a film about matter of taste. It might have appealed to the people of the sixties with their fascination for things black and white.But Psycho does not make any sense in the colored era of 2007."
klsmith18,"Oct 29, 1999",N/A,"I have been reading some of the comments about Psycho and was shocked to read that some of the viewers thought that it was rubbish. You have to realise that for its day it was a shocker. It broke all the conventions of the horror films in that day. Every shot was carefully thought out, for example, because of film laws, Hitchcock couldn't show the knife touch the body in Shower scene, but the way that it was shot made you believe that you were seeing it.Many people prefere the new version because it is in colour. Colour films had been around for quite some time when the film was made. Hitchcock decided to make it in Black and White for a reasion. You have to agree that it makes the film very scary. The shadows are enhanced on the house and Norman's face appears to be horribly hollow, just like the final image of his mother.In my opinion, the new version is good, but the use of colour changes the initial image that Hitchcock wanted to put across."
ssghassem,"May 29, 2023",9/10,"This is definitely one of my all time favorites among the classics. It still holds up even in 2023. The acting and cinematography in an all black and white film is mesmerizing. It's satisfying and well done. It's not scary for a typical ""horror"" film yet it has a nice plot twist that some may see coming but it is so well down that even if you do see it coming then you can still appreciate it. I love how the ending is full circle. It explains everything and leaves you not wondering what if or how. Everything is spelled out for you. It makes it so satisfying. The music is also classic and beautiful and memorable. I love this movie and it is rewatch-able over an over again. A semi slow burn but yet captivating and well done!"
Ms_Carter,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,In my opinion Hitchcock's true masterpiece I got to see this when the internet was non existent and spoilers weren't really a thing I envy anyone going to see this for the first time poor Marion just wasn't a very good robber Even if mother and Norman hadn't gotten her The authorities probably would have in just a matter of time Although the shower scene is a classic It's not my favorite kill (Best kill for me) Detective Arbogast The scene seemingly comes from out of nowhere and completely caught me off guard When he goes flying backwards down the steps spiraling backwards and flailing arms Literally Scared The CRAP Outta Me.

FilmOtaku,"Aug 5, 2005",9/10,"The plot of Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 film ""Psycho"" is by now the stuff of legend; Marion Crane (Leigh), a secretary in Phoenix is desperate to marry her boyfriend Sam (Gavin), only Sam is still paying off debts from his previous marriage. One Friday a man comes into her real estate office with $40,000 in cash to purchase a house for his daughter. Instead of taking the money to the bank as her boss directed, Marion packs her bags and leaves town with the money, presumably to give to Sam so they can finally make a life together. After driving for a day and a half, she ends up stopping at a motel only 10 miles from Sam's home. The Bates Motel, operated by one Norman Bates (Perkins) is a creepy place shrouded with mystery, particularly the mystery that is Norman's mother, a driving force that looms over the property and controls Norman himself. When Marion does not show up for work on Monday, her sister Lila (Miles) comes looking for her as well as a detective, Arbogast (Balsam) hired by Marion's employer. Unfortunately they all find that as one mystery begins to unravel, another one, more quizzical and shocking is ready to take its place, and none of them are safe from the danger of the Bates Motel.I'm pretty sure that there isn't much more to say about this film that hasn't already been said; ""Psycho"" being one of the most studied and analyzed films in film history. (I myself took a class in college that examined parts of the film frame by frame, and have read books analyzing the film) However, I have to wonder if the sensation of the film and the fact that it is an instant classic, regardless if someone has seen it or not (truthfully, I have heard people say, ""Oh, that is such a classic."" And then later admit that they haven't yet seen the film at all.), sometimes waters down its mastery and the impact this film had (and continues to have) on the film industry as a whole. If you ever get the opportunity to see the art exhibit ""24 Hour Psycho"", wherein the artist slows the film down to make the running time span an entire day, or if you were to read the excellent book Shower Scene in Hitchcock's Psycho: Creating Cinematic Suspense and Terror by Philip J. Skerry, you can see how incredibly impeccable each frame of the film is. If you were to lay out any scene in the film and look at it frame by frame, you would have some incredibly compelling photographs, and that was exactly how Hitchcock intended his presentation to be.Aside from being a work of art, it is well known that ""Psycho"" changed the way that moviegoers attended the cinema. Because of the big event that occurs halfway through the film, Hitchcock could not have people continuing their normal practice of strolling into the theater whenever they felt like it. If any of these people came to see a Janet Leigh picture, they would be pretty confused at that point. So Hitchcock, ever the showman (and his own greatest publicist) announced that no one would be admitted into the theater after the movie began. This was HUGE for its time. Besides changing the attendance factor, it was one of the greatest publicity stunts of its time. If people weren't going to go to the film before, they sure were going to check it out now. I'm sure that ""Psycho"" doesn't have as much of an impact to people who grew up on slasher films or other horror films, but despite the fact it was released 45 years ago, its secrets are now the stuff of general film knowledge, and personally, the fact that I have studied it clinically, when I went to see it at the classic movie house two weeks ago, I still found that my heart was racing and the hair was standing up on my arms during the very last scene of the film. Even more of a testimony to its impact is the fact that a friend that I attended the film with, who isn't much of a film fan, much less a classic film buff not only said that he was so tense during the film that he was on pins and needles, but that he wanted to see it again, and soon. Why does this film have such a forceful impact nearly five decades after it was first released? I'm sure that one of the several hundred books written about this film and Hitchcock's filmography could give you several reasons at length. But a simple answer may sum it up best for now: It's simply a damn good movie. 9/10--Shelly"
ryanjpeed,"Apr 5, 2014",10/10,"Psycho is a film that marks its place in movie history. From beginning to end, you are focused, listening to every word they say. But when stuff goes down, you are hiding behind your blanket, trying to protect yourself from what you're about to see. Yeah, it's from the 1960's, but this isn't like a 1960's horror movie. The film is thrilling and violent, but most of all, it's entertaining from beginning to end. With a killer soundtrack, it's no wonder you jump out of your seat when something surprising happens. And, yes. The twist ending is the father of twist endings. It's great. Long story short, see this movie. I recommend it to everyone reading this, and everyone not reading this, still see the movie. It's really good.10/10"
miguelsanchez69,"May 26, 2003",5/10,"This is a well directed and extremely well-scored movie. Unfortunately, while the movie is interesting for its place in cinematic history, (just look at the accelerated editing in the shower scene) it really isn't at all scary, or even all that interesting today. The production values for the movie are amazingly low, and it often shows (it was filmed on the cheap on a hitchcock presents TV lot). The script is weak and reeks of an exploitation film. The acting is good, though not great. Bad material handled by a great director that's worth watching if youre interested in cinema or too old to enjoy a gory, though better film. If you're looking for the zenith of this genre look elsewhere (ie: Halloween). If you're looking for the pioneer, this is it."
chris-636,"Oct 29, 1999",N/A,"I saw this movie for the first time in 1974 at age 16 and Anthony Perkins' chilling portrayal as mama's boy Norman Bates frightened me throughout the whole film.  It also shed a new light on taking showers alone at home.  Even today, in 1999 at age 41 I still get nervous when I hear strange noises while taking a shower."
EdwardtheBlackPrince,"Jun 24, 2023",8/10,When it's comes to Alfred Hitchcock Pyscho there's been much to been said about it there has also been that can not been said about it. That being it was a film of its time and ahead of time all around. It was the precursor to the Slasher as well the mind of the human mid. While seen as very tamed from a modern perspective it was very bold of its day. How it delved into the themes of brutal violence and sexuality adds to the scenery of suspense. The use of soundtrack and the shots of he stairs to the overlook of the Motel. The movie has a very eerie somber tone to it. Adding a sense of mystery and suspense. The cast give great performances of course Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates a lot of character to both of them and as you watch you begin how they both feel like prisoners running from their problems.
westersnows,"Apr 8, 2014",10/10,"Another favorite. I'm pretty sure this film is to blame for my early and unending love of thrillers and horror films (only the good ones though). As usual, the photography is my favorite part, as well as the editing, since both aid each other extremely well. I'm not even going to touch the shower scene, that's been analyzed to death (but I do love it). My favorite part of the photography is when she's asleep in the car, and the cop comes and talks to her through the window. The close ups in that scene are amazing. A+ acting too, perfect amount of tension. I also like when she's driving and all the bright lights are blinding her from the other side of the road. I'm so pleased they decided to film this is b&w.There are a couple other things I'd like to mention too. First, this film totally flaunts the code, right from the opening scene. I normally wouldn't have noticed it as a casual viewer but bearing in mind film history, this is the beginning of the end of the code (finally!). Second, the score is absolutely brilliant. About 90% of my music collection is film scores and I've been a fan of Bernard Herrmann since realizing he did a great number of soundtracks for Hitchcock films (North by Northwest is great, and some non Hitchcock films like Mysterious Island are good too). But wow, the Psycho score is really quite amazing. It's so unobtrusive yet brilliantly sets the mood. And I'm not talking about the screeching strings, even though they're the most famous."
MCandy14,"Nov 13, 2014",10/10,"By far the greatest work of The Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock. When I watched this film for the first time aged 16, I was sucked in by the plot, the characters, Bernard Herrmann's score and the terrific acting. I went in knowing one thing about the movie, and that was that there is a shower scene. It was the first Hitchcock film I'd ever seen and it was the first mystery/thriller I'd ever seen. Now I am a big fan of both Hitch and the genre.The best aspect of this movie is the fantastic acting. What can you say that hasn't already been said about the performance of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates except that it's a tragedy he wasn't nominated for an Oscar. His delivering of the script, his shyness and sudden twists is one of the best acting performances I've witnessed. But that doesn't take away from the rest of the cast. Janet Leigh is wonderful as Marion Crane, and supporting talent from John Gavin, Martin Balsam and especially Vera Miles, make for a film you can watch over and over.This is the first film I ever saw where afterwards, I wanted to know everything there was to know about it. I watched all the making of documentaries I could find, I wanted to watch all the sequels (Psycho II is also very good by the way) and I even chose the film as my specialist subject in a quiz we did in my college.I recommend this film to everyone. It's full of twists, turns and surprises that keep you guessing right until the end, and I mean the very end. You can't take your eyes of the screen. You're engrossed by these characters and the plot that you don't want to miss a second.Suspenseful, sophisticated, chilling, thrilling and an absolute masterpiece of film making."
Jerm-2,"Sep 8, 1998",10/10,"This is by far and away the greatest movie I have ever seen. Hitchcock did a great job directing this movie. It grabbed your attention at the very first and then something else happened, and then something else, and things kept piling on until you had no clue how the ending was going to turn out. This is the kind of movie you think about for hours after you see it because there's so much to it! And then of course the marvelous ending. I won't say it here in case if you haven't seen it, luckily when I saw it I didn't even know the ending. You must MUST go see this film if you haven't yet, Hitch's best."
Vartiainen,"May 3, 2018",7/10,"One of Alfred Hitchcock's most well-known films. Regarded as one of the very first examples of the slasher genre. Still one of the most beloved thrillers ever made and an all-around classic. The shower scene movie.And yet, if that's all you know the movie from, you're missing a lot. The shower scene was scandalous back in its day, much like the rest of the film in general, but it doesn't encapsulate the film all that well. It happens near the middle of the film and a lot happens after it. Sure, it is the most striking scene in the film, but I would personally put more weight on the overall performances of Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates and Janet Leigh as Marion Crane.With these two powerful actors Hitchcock manages to tell a truly haunting and nerve-wracking story. Because, to be honest, nowadays the movie would be a bit boring and a lot predictable. The viewer is never truly confused as to where the film is going. But in a way that even enhances the experience. Because you can so clearly see why these characters would make these decisions given the amount of information they have.Add in some masterful camerawork, some really insightful use of surroundings and shadows, the two main actors and a one of the creepiest scores ever produced, and you have a masterful film in your hands.A must see film for all fans of horror and still a really, really good experience all around, despite its age."
rsilva,"Oct 12, 1998",10/10,"Psycho is one of the great movies because of the way it manipulates the audience. Everybody these days has at least an idea of who Norman Bates really is and what he does, but the movie still has the power to fascinate and to induce terror no less than poor Miss Crane's. The use of amazing photography and lighting schemes, the classic score, the ""McGuffin"" of the stolen money, and captivating performances by all actors (especially Janet Leigh and, famously and typecasting-ly, Anthony Perkins) add to the mix, pushing the audience's emotions one way and then another: tension, humour, humanity, terror, confusion, and a final horror. Ultimately, it is a visceral but above all highly entertaining experience."
CriticsVoiceVideo,"Mar 6, 2021",3/10,"I can't believe this movie is regarded as some brilliant cinema classic. It was going great until the last fifteen minutes, in which it became absolutely ridiculous. It went from being hilarious and intriguing to downright fatuous. The murder scenes are completely cheesy and laughable. Her eye moved twice when she was dead. The monologue the psychiatrist gave at the end was embarrassing. I can see how in 1960 this would have been groundbreaking and shocking, however it does not stand the test of time. I give it a three for good acting."
machette,"Mar 11, 2000",N/A,"This is the father of all slasher films. it is also one of the best. Without Norman Bates there would be no Michael Meyers, Freddy Krueger, or Jason Vorhees(whom I might add will kick Freddy's kentucky fried butt in Jason vs Freddy). The makers of Halloween realised this and even named one of their main characters after a character in Psycho: Sam Loomis. So if wanted to see the movie that stared  the slasher genre this it. Worth the time and money to see."
braddugg,"May 4, 2014",10/10,"Probably, the most terrific thriller made. A film that terrifies even 50 years after it's made.To pigeonhole this as a thriller would be wrong as per me. It has a murder mystery, a psychological thriller, a huge amount of drama, and even a family backdrop. With all such elements, it would be wrong if I were to categorize this as merely a thriller. Yes, it is filled with thrills and for the 110 minutes of running time, there is hardly any dull moment.I have seen this movie, a number of times before and each time it had a terrific impact. Also, I have always found something new, maybe a new frame, new shot or a new background sound. The discovery does not seem to stop. This I attribute to the many elements that are involved in this film.From placing the camera, composing the shot, revealing the right emotion and making the audiences wait till the shocking aspect is revealed, Hitchcock is at his best in this film. This is indeed one of the more simpler stories he dealt. Yet, he made it so impact full that it continues to surprise audiences even today. Thanks to the music by Bernard Hermann, whose contribution to the film is very important. I cannot imagine this film without the music and I believe that it's because of the music, that the resonance was acquired.If it's the shower scene that is most talked about in this film, I believe there are couple or more scenes that are under rated yet very impact full. Now, I do not want to reveal those and give away some details. I can simply say, I was terrified by the climax shot where the mother is shown, more than anything else.The cast is perfect equally, Anthony Perkins does a wonderful job as Norman Bates. He is cold blooded and yet looks so deceptively humane as an extremely caring human. This film and ""The Trial"" are perhaps the most important films in his career.It is the first psychological thriller of it's kind as I read in various other sites and perhaps it is also the most violent films made. Though the violence comes for less than 10 minutes, it haunts so brutally, as if it was there all through the film.It's a definite 5/5 for one of the finest films of all time by one of the greatest directors.http://braddugg.blogspot.in/"

I've seen this marvel of cinema many times and watched it again last night (19th Sept 2019) and it's stil got the magic.It's amazing to think at the time that this film wasn't even nominated for best picture category at the oscars and now 59 years later its listed as IMDb's top rated films at number 40 has embedded itself in our worldwide pop culture has a metascore of 97, it's rated fresh on rotten tomatoes with a 96% with an audience score of 95%These aren't all just lucky coincidences folks this film really is that good and better and if u haven't seen it what's stopping you.Just don't take a shower after watching this film :)"
jhaggardjr,"Jun 17, 2000",10/10,"""Psycho"" is Alfred Hitchcock's best film. The Master of Suspense directed a lot of great films throughout his astonishing career such as ""North by Northwest"", ""Vertigo"", ""Rear Window"", and ""The Birds"". But ""Psycho"" is my all-time favorite Hitchcock movie. Everything about this movie is great in every way. From the splendid performances by the entire cast (especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh in their most famous roles) to Bernard Herrmann's eerie and famous music score to Hitchcock's use of unusual camera angles to the site of the Bates Motel and the creepy house that sits above it to the dark humor that is presented and to that unforgettable shower scene, ""Psycho"" is a brilliant horror film that will live on for years to come. Now just forget about that stupid shot-by-shot remake from 1998. The original 1960 picture is definitely the one to see.**** (out of four)"
Tremor,"Dec 30, 1998",10/10,"What more can be said about ""PSYCHO"",Alfred Hitchcock's 1960 classic that spawned an entire genre...the slasher film. To prove that this masterpiece truly stands the test of time,I recommended it to two of the 7th grade students that I teach (who have been subjected to the whole ""Halloween-Friday The 13th-Nightmare On Elm Street-Scream"" recycling bin)...and they loved it! The black-and-white cinematography is gorgeous,and the legendary musical score by Bernard Herrmann has never been matched (with John Carpenter's creepy ""Halloween"" score as a worthy runner-up). The 1998 remake is a pointless,cheap,waste of time (as it wastes the enormous,combined talents of Vince Vaughn,Anne Heche,Julianne Moore,William H.Macy,Philip Baker Hall and Robert Forster). As a movie buff and horror film addict,I cannot recommend ""PSYCHO"" enough...it is the definitive slasher film,and in my opinion,the best horror film ever! I'm not going to waste any time summarizing the now-familiar plot. Let's just say that no one twitched like the late,great Anthony Perkins,and the only actress to match Janet Leigh's shower scream is her daughter Jamie Lee Curtis of ""Halloween"" fame. **** A+ (10/10)"
mcfly-31,"Jan 12, 2001",7/10,"What else can I add about this film?  One of the more famous settings ever (the motel), one of the most famous movie names (Norman Bates), and of course, probably the most memorable killing on film (shower, anyone?). There's no real point in summing up again, but, what the hay.  Leigh embezzels money and skips town.  She ends up at a remote motel and has dinner with the owner (Perkins).  Though long winded, the scene in the parlor stays captivating with the dialogue and the subtle music softly in the background.   They both discuss the things wrong in their lives, his biggest problem, his domineering ""mother"" (and I always wondered if people who haven't seen the film thought of when every critic always put quotations around mother).  She retires for the night, and while unwinding with a shower, is brutally knifed by some woman.  The mother?  You'll find out if you haven't seen it.  The rest of the film deals with Perkins trying to cover up the crime, as others come looking for Leigh.  I say it's Hitchcocks best, but that's mostly based on the fact that I didn't like his other movies (""Frenzy"" was ok).  Performance wise, you couldn't ask for much more, as Perkins is terrifically understated as Norman, the role that pidgeon-holed the rest of his career.  He pretty much carries the film as the others, good actors no doubt, have little screen time.  A sequel followed 23 years later(!), one I went for more being a kid of the 80s. Part III was good as well (Perkins directed nicely), but IV was a lame made for cable film.  There was also an awful remake in 98, check it out at your own risk.  As far as the beginning of it all, it can be slow in spots, but is a well told story and one of only a few films before the 80s that I liked."
TheCorniestLemur,"Aug 27, 2020",9/10,"I wasn't all that impressed with Rear Window or Blackmail and was ready to write Hitchcock off as a director that just wasn't for me, but I definitely can't say I've been as scared by a film anywhere near this old before. Those strings. And that cinematography.
I realised it's all the little things Hitchcock does that makes him the ""master of suspense"", even in the first act before the Bates Motel is even remotely part of the film, it's still so nail-biting watching Marion make her escape, but when it culminates in THAT scene, christ.
I do feel as though the second act is a little too slow and predictable, however, but the third, and ESPECIALLY that final scene, bring it home so well.
""She wouldn't even harm a fly..."" ughhhhhh the chills"
sandeepmessi1993,"Aug 6, 2013",7/10,"Many claims it to be Hitchcock's best but I disagree. 10/10 are from those who didn't see the twist coming. After watching Rear Window, I had high hopes for this one and well it was another wonderful movie too but didn't live up to the IMDb ratings and class expected in my opinion. Not that it isn't great, maybe I'm one of those 1 out of 100 people not to be fazed by this film. As the title of the film suggest, I anticipated the twist and it the part which is supposed to 'blow your mind' was way too predictable for me. But top notch direction again. The characters were strong and the suspense is well documented to thrill the audience, but this isn't Hitchcock's finest, not by a mile."
senorpigeon11,"Apr 26, 2002",4/10,"Compared to many of Hitchcock's other works, this movie is a bust. Although it may have been extremely scary at the time, today it is laughably bad. The story sucks and the acting isn't great.  The one thing I do give Hitchcock credit for doing well is the famous shower scene. Without it the movie would have never even been heard of."
dieselh12,"Mar 29, 2000",N/A,Well this movie still is one to remeber. Why.Well it was the one that started all the slasher movies. It was the movie that inspired Halloween.The characters in the movie are pretty good. The story was strong and some what powerful.I also liked the setting and the dark skies and the rain. It made me relaxBut it will always be the best black and while movie along side Night of the Living Dead
kenty,"Jun 17, 2000",10/10,"What more can be said? For sheer terror there is only one Psycho. It's part of our national psyche. Alfred Hitchcock and Bernard Herrmann; the Master Director with a masterful score by Mr.Herrmann. Hope,Love,Lust,Insanity; it's all here...and much, much more. Is there a more beautiful victim than Janet Leigh? Is there a more kind killer than Anthony Hopkins? Great!!!"
JoshtheGiant,"Dec 27, 2005",10/10,"Psycho is considered by many critics and audiences as the best horror film ever made. I don't think it is that but it is still impossible to say that it is not a great film and is one of the best horror films ever, maybe top five, but not one. Alfred Hitchcock is on the other hand the best director ever to grace the cinema. He has created some of the best films ever and has never made a bad one. Some of his best are the original The Man Who Knew too Much, Psycho, and North By Northwest. The plot to Psycho is amazing, every thing seems more real than you would expect from this kind of film. The screenplay is also great. With very good characters and dialogue. The screenplay is also very daring doing very new things. The performances are also great. Anthony Perkins in particular is amazing but everyone give great performances. Janet Leigh is probably second best in her Oscar nominated performance. She brings her character to life very well, but Perkins doesn't. He just becomes that character, and that is one of the best performances in history. The visual effects are excellent for the time and would stand up fairly well for today. This is one of Hotchcocks best films and is one to watch over and over and over again."
Roderick-3,"Aug 18, 1999",10/10,"Stunning performances, especially by Anthony Perkins who was never in the future so good. Great photography in b/w. Hitchcock's best film and a masterpiece of directing. The chilling music from Bernard Herrmann I can't forget. I love the scene in the shower, which was later in dozens horror films and the killing of detective Arbogast. I must see Psycho soon again. The sequel was also good, but the color was for me disturbing. Parts 3 and 4 was bad and the new version was very bad. Why make the same movie with bad actors? Vince Vaughn (as new Norman Bates) is better in the film Clay Pigeons. There he is also villain and I can this movie also recommend."
JoakzUy,"Sep 29, 2025",9/10,"The film is good, intriguing, and from the moment you start, you can't take your eyes off the screen.It's a very tense film, and I generally love it, but there's one aspect where the film really shines, and that aspect where the film goes from being just a good '60s film to becoming one of the best films in history: the ending. The plot twist at the end is insane; it was so surprising that it was at that moment that I understood why this film is so critically acclaimed."
lasherxl,"Sep 3, 2000",10/10,"What more can be said about this, but it was Hitchcock at his very best. It made Anthony Perkins and Norman Bates both household names. Hitchcock changed the face of film making forever and no director will ever surpass his genius. Absolutely fantastic!!"
Stelly_cookie,"Feb 2, 2025",7/10,"First thing first I need to say that I'm not used to black and white movies and since I love cinematography I'm trying to watch as much cults as possible and building a culture.At he begging I thought that this was a boring movie about a girl and her life with a plot twist but then things went crazy and seeing how the movie gets progressively crazier was very interesting and convoluting, of course the ""special effects"" are old so it's not a terrifying movie since the scary scenes are not scary, of course there is suspence but nothing really scary extra honestly.I watched this movie with my dad who already Knew the plot and it was good, I give 6 stars since It's a very nice movie but it's not Not my kind of movie but I really enjoyed it and suggest it.It's also very interesting seeing psychological traits and explanations at the end, especially from an older point of view.Freud would've enjoyed this movie very much."
moors,"Aug 4, 1999",10/10,"A brilliant film. It still scares people today. This movie has Hitchcock's signature all over it. No one else could have done it. Suspense from start to finish. One of the finest,if not the finest,horror movie ever made."

dannyward-10963,"Feb 27, 2021",5/10,I've been watching a lot of critically acclaimed films lately and this is the first to let me down. I didn't find Psycho to be the least bit scary and I saw the 'twist' coming from a mile away.The only positives I take from the film is Anthony Perkins did a very good job as Norman Bates and the music in the film was quite good. I understand it may have been scary for the time of release and that audiences back then may not have been accustomed to a plot twist but this is a 'classic film' that unfortunately does not hold up today.
Steve-331,"Jan 11, 2000",N/A,This movie was the best Psycho movie ever. The Remake did not have half the good acters in this film.I think this movie did a good job on telling about all the characters and who they are and what they do.I believe this was the film that made Anthony Perkins famous.It starts with a women named Maron Crane. A Secretary for some rich company. So when she is asked to deliver money to the bank she takes the money. But the money never got there. As the day went by she had so much stress on her mind. So she left town and that was the last anyone had saw her. So on that night it was raining hard so she stops at a low down hotel called the Bates Motel. She then meets the owner of the Hotel Norman Bates. Who lives in a House above the hotel. For awhile the 2 talk with Norman having a crush on her. Then somtime later Maron is taking a shower when she is attacked by a killer.For days the town and Marons sister tried to find her. But no luck.I won't ruin the rest.
Dracula-8,"Aug 12, 1999",9/10,"I watched this movie because someone said it is Hitch's best. I haven't watched all of his movies, so I can't say if it is his best or not. However, it is a really good movie, mostly because of the great performance of 'Norman Bates'. I don't understand why somebody will consider his performance as dry or dull. His performance is fabulous! It was so scary when you saw him having that evil smile on his face, in the dark when he just said goodbye to Marion. You know there's something wrong with him but you don't know what will happen next. You can guess he's probably the murderer but don't know why. The ending is quite surprising. I like the ending. Very special. Not something we'll see these days. Highly recommend."

Michael_Pilkington,"Mar 12, 1999",10/10,"""Psycho"" still remains a classic after thirty-eight years.  It had been imitated by so many slasher films such as ""Halloween,"" ""Friday the 13th,"" ""A Nightmare on Elm Street,"" and ""Scream.""  Not even the pointless 1998 remake can beat Alfred Hitchcock's original.  Anthony Perkins delivers a sincere performance as the mama's boy, Norman Bates who runs a motel.  Janet Leigh also turns in a good performance as the embezzler Marion Crane who checks in and gets stabbed repeatedly in the famous shower scene.  Even the Bernard Herman score is very suspenseful.  The only slasher film that comes close to perfection is ""Halloween.""  Remember: the key is suspense, NOT blood and gore.  My evaluation: **** out of ****."
Herr Nosferatu,"Dec 13, 1998",10/10,"Psycho , Alfred Hitchcock's classic about a guy and his mother is the movie that is at the origin of all horror movies ever made . It is truly an experience to live !!!!!!!!!!!!The music has a great part in this movie .Anthony Perkins is the ultimate psychopath ever !!! He and his ""mother "" are the best killer duo ever produced.The new version is good but not quite as great as the original.Still I urge all movie lovers to see it , whether it's the original or the new version , GO SEE THIS ULTIMATE EXPERIENCE!!!"
Semih,"Jun 6, 2000",9/10,"Ofcourse Hitchcock is a great director. But try watching this movie without Bernard Herrmann's score and it will lose almost everything about it. Hitchcock wanted to shoot the shower sequence (most memorable but over-exagerated scene) without any music. Big mistake. Mr. Herrmann thought so too. And now it has become a masterpiece. Talking about the shower scene being over rated; my favorite scene in the film is where the lady is driving at night and it starts raining and she turns on the wipers and she keeps looking at the rear view mirror and then she finally ends up at the motel. That whole sequence is brilliant film making that owes much of its brilliance to Herrmann's score. You feel her anxiety because of her feeling of guilt for what she has done, and we as an audience have a feeling that there isn't something that pleasing awaiting her at the end of the road. How do we know that? Pay attention to how the fast pace of the string ensemble comes to an abrupt change with pizzicatos and low resonance bows, once we see the sign of the motel. And notice how the cue leads up to that part; pure genius at work here, ladies and gentleman. If it weren't for Herrmann's musical score, this film would be just an average movie."
livieelynn,"Dec 17, 2015",6/10,"For a black and white film, this was extremely well done. The lighting and contrast was perfect and really set the mood for a good film. It wasn't too bright or too dark and it outlined characters faces and the blood during the ""violent"" scenes. The camera was great when shooting at different angles. Especially in dramatic scenes, the camera would focus in and out of the scenes to add more flare to the subject and take long shots. I felt like the meaning behind the movie wasn't that strong because it was just a ""horror"" film. Behind it, though, there was definitely a hint of mistrust and deceit. It kind of showed that psychos are everywhere , no matter where you go and that you should be very careful in going to new places and with strangers because they could not be who they say they are. Acting was okay and some scenes you could tell were really fake but a good film overall."
kalina2,"Apr 28, 2006",10/10,"I saw this movie in a packed house in 1960 without any knowledge of the plot--and judging by the reaction of the audience when the shower scene occurred, no one else had knowledge either.When the scene began developing, there were gasps. When the curtain few open there were screams, and they continued during the stabbing. A state of fright literally hung over the theater. When Ms. Leigh slid down slowly, dying, people were still gasping and crying out. They were there! They had witnessed a real murder! Nothing in any previous movie had prepared the audience for this kind of shock.It was years before I could take a shower and not re-experience that state of fright again.Maybe you had to be there to understand this."
tsheridan94,"Feb 8, 2010",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho was the movie that revolutionized horror forever. This is a must-see for anyone who calls themselves a connoisseur of horror. And while not the scariest film ever, or even in the top tier, it still provides a marvelous psychological aspect, and some genuinely terrifying moments.Psycho also has one of the most famous horror sequences, and even movie scenes in general. Is there anyone who hasn't heard of the shower scene? This scene is famous for a reason. The eclectic shots, switching so frequently that it almost looks like still frames create an atmosphere of realism. This seems like a newscast, a real event. And that's what is so scary about this movie. It seems completely real, as if these events could happen. Hitchcock caters to the imagination, his brand of fear rooted in emotion, not visuals.Hitchcock's classic black and white tale of passion and horror was revolutionary for the time, and consequently has spawned a slew of imitators. None of these emit the intensity so easily shown in Hitchcock's Psycho. There has even been a remake, a travesty to the original. In the spirit of honor, the 1998 film with Vince Vaughn should change it's name so it won't be associated with this 1960 gem.Hitchcock was, and actually still is, a force to be reckoned with in this league. He is a force of nature. New horror movies come and go, and, aside from a very select few, are forgotten in a matter of months. Hitchcock as shown his staying power in the dog eat dog world of horror by creating not one, or two, but countless classics. The greatest of these, though, was unquestionably his little came changer called Psycho."
psycho_153,"Dec 28, 1999",5/10,"Psycho is a classic, and a great watch. I t may not be the best movie like many people have claimed, the movie isn't very scary and the shower scene is very quick and over in a few seconds, but I guess it was made in the 60's when nothing like this had ever been done before. Yes I enjoyed it very much and I was thinking the whole way through. Anthony Perkins plays the role of Norman great, his friendly smiles, his comments his speeches ""We all go a little mad sometimes"") and just his general acting, the way he walked and moved. The story is Janet Leigh steals some money from her boss and takes off in her car to go to another city for the weekend. She stops off during a stormy night for a stay at the Bates Motel, run by Norman Bates. She gets into the shower in her room, but never comes out. Janet's family come looking for her, questioning all the places in the area, and they are curious about the Bates motel, for Norman isn't normal, and his loveable mother who sits in the house behind the hotel, isn't so loveable either. I long running time, but every second of it was needed and worth it. A must see!!"
e-jane,"Dec 26, 1998",8/10,"The best way to approach Psycho would be with no previous knowledge at all. As it is, the shower scene has become one of the most notorious film shots of all-time, and the secret of the Bates family is no longer quite so secretive.However, even with this in mind, this is an amazing classic : the original horror movie.  Hitchcock has always been the master of suspense, and Psycho is just about his most sinister ever.  From the Gothic setting - the imposing mansion on the hill - to Norman's boyish manner and tortured intensity, Psycho delivers.And if it doesn't make you scream (or at least think twice before talking to that self-effacing stranger), nothing will.  Psycho truly is an incomparable portrait of a mind twisted into homicidal mania that fully deserves the accolades it has always received."
MovieFan983,"Feb 10, 1999",10/10,"Psycho is a pure classic, that along with Halloween is the scariest movie ever made. Anthony Perkins stars as the famous Norman Bates, who in fact is a psycho. Now how he comes in the story is this: Janet Leigh plays Marion Crane, she steals $40,000 from her boss, flees the town, and buys a new car. She decides to stay at a hotel, cleverly named The Bates Motel (Vacancy). Run by a timid, yet sweet man whose name is Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), now this man, is attracted to this woman, asked her for dinner, she declines. Now for the most famous scene in a horror film, she decides to take a shower, while he watches. He hears his mom calling him, so he goes up and sees what's wrong. While Marion Crane is taking a shower, the mother comes down and brutally stabs her to death. After all this, and people start to notice that she is gone, her sister and her boyfriend, decide to check out this motel. They hire an investigator to look into it. He finds nothing wrong with the place. What happens to him? Well you'll have to see the movie. Anyway, the sister and boyfriend, investigate and find out what Norman Bates really is. The film is extremely well-acted, not to mention directed by the master himself, Alfred Hitchcock. All the cast-mates support a wonderful script, and make this lively, scary, and classic horror movie a must-see. A 10!!! Unrated/Rated R for intense violence and some brief nudity."
MrskiViletic,"Nov 15, 2018",10/10,Psycho is more terrifying than any slasher flick in existence. Hitchcock shines as the master of suspense in his masterpiece which has found a place in pop culture and is groundbreaking for numerous reasons. A must watch for every horror and cinema fan in general.
viper-78,"Jun 18, 2000",9/10,"I didn't see all of Psycho, but what I did see of it I liked. The way Hitchcock killed of the ""main"" character in the first half hour was utterly amazing. The suspense was some of the best I've ever seen, and he did it without nudity. Now thats a sign of a great film-maker."
Eaglegrafix,"Feb 23, 2008",6/10,"It took me 48 years to see this movie. Not a fan of the horror genre, I generally avoid them. But there have been a few that I've see that are really good. Psycho is a good film but time has passed it by, it is a movie out of time and just does not carry the punch it did in 1960.Technology advances degrade much of technique used in this film. Audiences today are too sophisticated to be drawn into a film like this. Modern horror movies depend heavily on special effects and not on the subtleties used in Psycho. Being released in black & white is an advantage and helps give the film a feel of being the classic it is.Anthony Perkins is superb in the role as Norman Bates. Other than Martin Balsam and Perkins though, the rest of the actors deliver only average performances. The lines are rigid and often lame, again the effect of time passing the method by. Perkins however can take the worst role and give it smoothness.I'll not reveal any spoilers but for a movie so referenced and so often used in comedy and serious pieces, it is impossible to see this movie today without knowing what happens to the main characters."
erin_ed1981,"Jun 1, 2005",9/10,"I love Psycho so much I can't begin to describe what it means to me. The trouble is it has been over-sold in the last twenty years or so that it is known as the film with THAT scene in the shower. There's so much more to it than that. It is arguably the most influential film ever made, and the best directed one at that. Without it, there would be no Jaws, no Godfather, no Star Wars. Psycho may not be the greatest film ever made, nor the scariest film ever made, but is probably the best crafted thriller and a fine example of cinematic manipulation. Psycho continues to influence filmmakers. Look at the Psycho references in 2005's Houseof Wax (preservered mother, twin sons/ split personality, scary house on the hill.) Psycho is simply Great."

The_Jew_Revue,"Oct 10, 2025",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho remains one of the greatest thrillers ever made, and it's easy to see why it left such a lasting impression. Starring Janet Leigh as Marion Crane and Anthony Perkins as the unforgettable Norman Bates, the film is a masterclass in tension, atmosphere, and psychological storytelling. Perkins gives an epic, haunting performance-his polite awkwardness masking deep madness beneath the surface. When I first saw this film as a kid, around eight or nine years old, it didn't scare me as much as it fascinated me. It was the movie that first opened my eyes to Hitchcock's genius and set me on the path to becoming the film aficionado I am today.What makes Psycho so brilliant is that it's not built on supernatural horror or jump scares, but on the frightening realism of human insanity. Hitchcock uses logic, psychology, and shocking plot twists to create fear rooted in the believable. The film's stark black-and-white cinematography and Bernard Herrmann's piercing score enhance its unsettling tone, making it both elegant and terrifying. Even after all these years, Psycho stands as a testament to the power of suggestion and suspense over gore, and it continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences alike."
FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Feb 4, 2005",10/10,"Psycho is the one true horror film, it's better than other great horror movies like The Shining, Halloween, The Exorcist, and it's better than Hitchcock's classic The Birds. This is the movie with the shower/murder scene that is possibly the most referenced scene in movie history. Everything about that scene is classic, from the camera angles, to the music, to the blood running into the sink(which was chocolate syrup since the movie was in black and white).This is a very difficult film to write a review on. What I can say is take the advice given by Alfred Hitchcock at the showing of this movie when it was in the theater. His advice was to not even enter the movie if it had already started, because it can only be seen from the beginning. That is exactly how this movie is meant to be seen. Despite being in black and white, this movie is still a shocking experience. I think it should have been a crime to do what Hollywood did, they made a remake of this. When Hollywood does a remake of such a classic film like Psycho, then you know that they are very desperate to make money.Everybody should see this, it is almost a perfect movie and is still shocking today."
syrtis,"Aug 1, 1998",10/10,"I've heard so much about this film before I watch it. Luckily i didn't know the ending of this film, if not, things would be so different. I think this is one of Hitchcock's best movies. If you've seen the film, you'll know that this kind of plot could easily turn out to be banal. This revealed the splendid skills of Hitchcock in handling such kind of movies. Apart from this, i must say that Anthony Perkins did very well. He was made for the role of Norman Bates. This is my favourite film of all times. Everyone who hasn't seen it yet, better watch it NOW."
mrgray83,"Feb 19, 2005",10/10,"I consider myself relatively new to Hitchcock's films. Before Psycho, it was The Birds and Vertigo. Vertigo got me hooked, so I decided to give the 1960 Psycho a day in court after seeing the 1998 remake. I now see why a remake was such an infamous move, at least remaking it word for word and scene for scene. Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho stands rightfully so as one of the greatest horror/psychological flicks of all time. Alfred Hitchcock's direction as always is on point and the acting is wonderful, especially the Norman Bates character. A truly deranged individual. If you pay enough attention, you can piece together the ending before it actually happens, but even then it's still shocking based on Hitchcock's amazing shooting style. I give this a 10/10. A definite classic in my book."
evanston_dad,"Oct 31, 2005",10/10,"I can't decide whether ""Psycho"" or ""Rear Window"" is Hitchcock's best film. My answer on any given day is usually dependent on which one I've most recently watched.There's no need to go into the performances, or the shocking story, or the Bernard Herrman score (one of the best ever in film history). All that's been covered. Having just watched this film again in honor of Halloween weekend, I was struck fresh by the movie's frankness, which had to have been beyond uncomfortable for film audiences at the time. Supposedly film executives on screening this film were shocked more than anything else by the shots of the toilet in the hotel bathroom. If that was enough to shock, then what about references to transvestites, sexual arousal and release, and the blood-splattered bathroom that Hitchcock shows Perkins cleaning up in rigorous detail? The movie is so honest about the human body, its more unpleasant urges and physical qualities, that when the camera follows a swirl of blood down the shower drain, you half expect to see a big clump of hair sticking out of it. And to think this film came out at the same time as Douglas Sirk was making his films, in which women are as carefully painted and polished as china dolls.The true test of a great film is how well it stands up to the test of time, and whether or not you can revisit it and find something new in it each time you do so. By that measure, ""Psycho"" is truly one of the greats.Grade: A+"
btjohnson2000,"Mar 4, 2023",6/10,"See it once and that is enough. Not an epoch film. When I read the novel, it really creeped me out. Not long after I watched the film and was disappointed. The only thing I liked in it were the story (which is absolutely the same as in the book), b/w cinematography and acting from Anthony Perkins. Shower scene and the scene when Bates runs in his mother's outfit were hilarious. What makes the film good is its story. Thanks to Robert Bloch, not Alfred Hitchcock! And come on, Hitchcock is overrated. Most of his films are very theatrical and acting in them is not credible. Hickcock criticizes other dramatic producers for their method of surprise but it exactly his method. I'm sure he is a kick at Hollywood parties."
sriramthestranger,"May 30, 2020",5/10,May be this is a brilliant movie as it was one of its kind in those times. Did not work in today's scenario having seen countless movies like this.
Michael_Elliott,"Sep 23, 2015",N/A,"Psycho (1960)**** (out of 4)There's really no point in giving a synopsis for this film. If you don't already know what this movie is about then you really need to stop reading this right now and go watch the movie. I've seen this movie dozens of times over the years from VHS to DVD to Blu- ray and I've seen it at least five times on the big screen and for my money this is Alfredy Hitchcock's greatest film and one of the greatest ever made. I know VERTIGO, a brilliant movie, gets all the love and respect but for my money this here is his greatest film.Where do you start with a movie like this? Everyone knows that the budget was slashed on the director and it certainly helped the film because had this been in color or had it been lavished with a big budget then it just wouldn't have the same feel. The movie has some of the most historic moments in film history that everyone knows about. These moments are of course the shower sequence as well as the ending. Both certainly deserve to be mentioned whenever you discuss brilliant scenes but for my money the greatest sequence in the movie is what happens before the shower sequence and it's the discussion between Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) and Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins) as they discuss what is basically holding them back.The performances between the two actors are just so flawless and this scene is so important because it tells us everything we need to know going into the second half of the movie, which is pretty much after the shower scene. The first portion of the movie we're worried and caring about the Crane character but we get the shock of what happens and then our sympathy immediately turns to Norman and him helping his mother. The way Hitchcock pulls this off is rather remarkable but the shocks keep happening with one terrific twist after another leading up to the ending.What's always amazed me about this movie is how your initial viewing is nothing but pure shocks and gasps but then on repeat viewings, even when you know all the secrets, you can enjoy it just as much because you can then enjoy the film by watching a master handle the material. You can watch for the clues and see all the winks that Hitchcock is giving the viewer. No matter how many times I watch this film I can simply sit back and enjoy it on so many levels. It's a movie where you brain knows what's going on but the film is just so great that you can enjoy everything and wish that the character's fate changes somehow.Everything from the performances to the score to the cinematography are flawless. This is without question one of the most impressive movies ever made. It's certainly a ground-breaking picture that has its legendary director at the top of his game. PSYCHO has been copied countless times over the past fifty-five years but nothing has come close to its impact."
graddy_uk,"Feb 25, 2005",8/10,"Only a week ago I sat through this movie in my English class and lets say that I was anticipating a whole lot of scares that worried me.The way the movie switches from calm to kill works well and I like the use your imagination rather than the gore.But the shower scene though great would have been pointless without the eeh eeh eeh music.The other psycho score was to up, down, fast, slow and was unmemorable and unhummable.The fact was that even though I saw the finale (lacks luster) I missed the revelations at the end (because the teacher left and people then started talking and throwing things) I want to see this movie again now! Its the only horror I've sat through other than the mummy/returns not that I'm a wuss I love scary games Half life 2 anyone?"
Smoknjoeyc,"Feb 26, 2005",10/10,"This had to be Alfred Hitchcock's best movie. In fact, it was my favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie. This movie was perfectly executed by Hitchcock. The acting was unbelievably tremendous. Each actor did an excellent job(especially Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh). The screenplay was great and the writing was tremendous. It's a movie about a woman(Leigh) who is out driving on a rainy night(after stealing a lot of money) and she stops at a motel where the owner has a mother, but is very lonely and befriends her. When she takes a shower, the figure of an old lady walks in and stabs her to death in the shower(this is remembered as the famous ""shower scene""). This was excellent and I give it a perfect 10 out of 10."
criticj,"Jul 30, 2022",10/10,Psycho delivers the suspense unlike any other thriller film that ever could! Cultural references to this film's most famous shower murder scene reigns it supreme as one of the Classical Hollywood Period's best known films today!!!
SKG-2,"Mar 15, 1999",10/10,"1960.  Alfred Hitchcock is, for his time, king of the world, with a string of hit movies, a hit TV show, and even growing critical respect (from ""auteur"" critics like Andrew Sarris and Francois Truffaut).  Flush with all of this success, did Hitchcock continue making the glossy entertainments he excelled at in the 1950's?  No.  Instead, he made a low-budget film which was obviously influenced by B-movies (notably the ones made by William Castle) and what he had learned on TV.  The result was PSYCHO, and it's safe to say movies were never the same again.Many articles have been written claiming Spielberg and Lucas have been responsible for the decline of movies today, and have been responsible for more cheap rip-offs than anyone else.  It seems to me Hitchcock and PSYCHO have inspired (if that's the right word) more rip-offs than Spielberg or Lucas put together.  Not just the obvious ways, like the many horror films which pay homage to it (DRESSED TO KILL, HALLOWEEN), or the films which have spoofed it(HIGH ANXIETY).  There's also its influence in narrative(speeding things up, instead of taking time to tell the story), its reliance on fairly thin characters, sparse dialogue, and of course, that music.  Someone more qualified than I could go at length at how Hitchcock's technique here has echoed throughout moviemaking today, but that influence to is undeniable.  I guess to sum up, PSYCHO does what Spielberg, Lucas, and every blockbuster film have been accused of doing; making a B-movie on the scale of an A-movie(of course, Hitchcock had a lower budget, but he did have stars like Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins, and well-known actors like John Gavin, Martin Balsam, and Vera Miles).As the rip-offs shouldn't put you off the Spielberg and Lucas films, nor should the rip-offs put you off of PSYCHO(I haven't seen the remake yet, but I still want to).  No matter how many times you've seen it before, the shower scene still packs a wallop.  So does the climax in the basement, and the final shot of Norman.  Perkins avoids the mistake most movie psychos (pardon the expression) make today by hamming it up; although you suspect something, you're prepared to dismiss him until you find out the truth.  This isn't my favorite Hitchcock (that honor goes to NORTH BY NORTHWEST), but it's a classic."
melea052002,"Apr 29, 2005",9/10,"I was first introduced to Alfred Hitchcock when I was very young, however, it was not until now that I knew what a monumental influence he had on film. In my college film class we had the chance to view Psycho and i have to admit at first, i was not extremely excited about it. However, I was hooked in the first five minutes of the film and I couldn't keep my eyes off the screen. I love psychological thrillers that make you wonder and think ""outside the box"" and i think this was one of the best i have ever seen. I think that Alfred's choices for the movie, (director, characters, etc.) were great. I thought all the characters did a fabulous job. The story line and plot were very creative too. I felt like i was being surprised every five minutes. I also like that this is an old black and white film. I don't think that it would have had the same impact on me if it was a modern story in color. It is definitely a classic!"

dominik-schmelzer,"Dec 3, 2014",3/10,"I do not get why this movie is so popular. I wouldn't watch it again either not only because the movie is black and white, but also the story is simple, but crazy. It do not get into time nowadays. But still the actors were good. I knew this movie from my parents but I expected also a bit more than the movie showed. What I actually like is that the movie is about real happenings, so that it interesting on the other side. It wasn't very exciting. The audio is cruel from todays view, but great for older times. The story was not awaited and simple. So for me it is a movie which was good in times before I lived, but I would rather watch horror movies that are in cinemas today."
Dtkoyzis,"Feb 12, 2001",N/A,"The first time I saw this film I was quite disappointed.  So much of it has become cliché in the four decades since its release, including the famous shower scene, Perkins' oedipal relationship with his mother, and even Bernard Herrmann's unsettling score.  I had known the identity of Perkins' ""mother"" even before I saw the film and had to be told by a sibling that the audience was not supposed to be aware of this up to the last.  It was like knowing the punch line in advance and not really getting the joke once it was actually told.  It is, to be sure, a tribute to Hitchcock that this film has become so much a part of North American popular culture, but the downside is that the element of shock that so affected audiences back in 1960 is almost entirely lost on a later generation of viewers.  One thus has to imagine what it would have been like to see it during its first run in the movie theatres.Had I been there at its opening, I think I would still have judged this film to be inferior to the string of excellent Hitchcock offerings preceding it during the previous decadefrom ""Strangers on a Train"" to ""North by Northwest.""  Why?  So much of his previous work had relied on the use of suspense to draw the viewers into the plot.  A good thriller builds this up carefully and deliberately until the final climax at or near the end of the film.  Good suspense leaves much unstated and works its way subtly into the imagination.  It's what you don't see that's the scariest. Think, for example, of the murder in ""Rear Window.""  You hear a crash and a short, shrill scream followed by ominous silence, but you're not really sure what's happened until much later.  Here, on the other hand, Hitch kills off his heroine brutally near the beginning of the film, leaving little if anything to the imagination, and largely putting aside the issues we had been misled to think the plot was building up to.Moreover, despite Hitch's tongue-in-cheek claim that he had intended it as a comedy, there is little of the director's famous humour so much in evidence in the immediately preceding film, ""North by Northwest.""  There is not much humour to be found in shock, while there is great humorous potential in suspense.  He should have stuck with suspense and left shock to a lesser director.I alluded to Herrmann's score.  Without it, I think this would have been judged a far less effective film and less the classic it is generally reputed to be.  Imagine Leigh driving along the highway without the composer's jittery music in the backgroundor, perhaps more accurately, the foreground.  In such scenes it is the music that almost entirely creates the suspenseful atmosphere.  Without it there is nothing of the sortjust Leigh driving and looking in her rear view mirror.  Period.  Not very scary.Is it a classic then?  It is, insofar as it influenced a whole generation of movie-goers and film makers who sought to imitate it.  But on its own merits, I don't think so."
lokifen,"Nov 26, 1998",10/10,"I viewed this movie at the age of 9 years old. It has been my favorite movie ever since. Almost 20 years. The two movies that affected me most as a child were: ""The Amityville Horror"" (I've had more dreams about that house than any other thing..ever!) and ""Psycho"". After watching ""Psycho"", I never viewed ANYTHING as being 100% safe. No castles, no zombies, no monsters. Normal people in risky situations exposed before all. Everyone has skeletons in their closets. Even those who seem to be as harmless as a fly. (Such as Norman Bates). This movie not only changed the course of movie history, by killing off the apparent heroine 1/3 of the way through the film (making history) but, proved that their was absolutely NOWHERE to be totally safe. It revealed inner demons of the two main characters which reflect on the entire world and maybe the truest description of how the world really is. Deep down we all have these bad thoughts, but unlike Norman Bates, most of us can bottle them up inside and carry them to the grave.After all, ""we all go a little mad...sometimes""."
moviewiz-4,"Sep 16, 2000",8/10,"I do not enjoy seeing black and white movie, by chance my cable tv shown this movie couple of years ago then i decided to watch it.I do not really know what this movie is all about until i see the part where Bates talking to his mother and i assumed the person is really his mother. A rather strange and make me guessing as the shower scene come out and the famous tune ""ing ing ing ing, deng deng..."" It makes glue to my sit and watch the entire movie instead.At the end of the movie, i then realised the mother is already dead and Norman Bates is considered as a person with psychiatric problem who impersonated his mother. It is really shocking and make me feel this movie is a must see thriller.Then the remake appeared and of course the audience will know what happen. The difference? colour,sound. The old movie is much more glim and dull with mono sound.8 out of 10"
punctate,"Aug 20, 1999",10/10,"Said to be Alfred Hitchcock's most terrifying film and it sure is with its compelling story and stunning score. Marion has stolen a large amount of cash and is driving to meet her boyfriend Sam. She stops at a place called Bates Motel, which is run by Norman Bates and his apparent overprotective mother. ""She just goes a little mad sometimes"" according to Norman Bates in his conversion with Marion. This leads to the famous shower scene and the compelling events that follow when Marion's sister is trying to find out what had happened to her. The ending of this movie is shocking and surprising. This movie was number 18 on the AFI hundred greatest movies. This Alfred best movie even according to the public I would say so myself. I can watch this movie over and over again; I would still not be bored with it. 5/5 for this frightening classic. Followed by 3 sequels and a remake."
BratBoy-2,"Nov 3, 1998",10/10,"I think this is one of the best films ever made.  It's a true classic.  I have seen it over 20 times and I find something new in it every time I see it and it never gets boring.  I'm really disappointed that they chose to remake it.  But 50 years from now, people will remember the original and not the remake. A lot of people these days will be turned off by the movie because it's old and in black and white, but everyone should see.  It's a technical marvel, Hitchcock was a wizard with the camera. There are also terrific performances by Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins.  This movie basically started the whole slasher film genre that John Carpenter kick-started in 1978 with Halloween.  In addition to being a great movie, it's also one of the most influential ever made.  Look at films like Brian DePalmas's Dressed to Kill and Halloween if you don't believe me."
Primtime,"Aug 29, 1999",9/10,"Psycho is more than just one of the best films of all-time. It is the inspiration behind a great number of films since and will forever be THE ultimate in both plot twists and suspense. Who would have ever imagined killing off both the main character and what seemed like an interesting story only a third into the film? Well, Hitch did and even told the moviegoers at the time to show up for the beginning of the film or else miss the wonderful Janet Leigh.Psycho has it all. A great story, well two as a matter of fact. One of the greatest scores by Bernard Herrmann (how many people don't know the skreetching violin and deep tuba sounds that really make the shower scene a classic?). The acting is superb with the chilling, almost-too-real portrayal of Norman Bates by Anthony Perkins and the running scared, almost-too-clued-out portrayal of Marion Crane by Janet Leigh. The supporting cast complete the film like few other casts do. Vera Miles makes the role of Crane's sister, honestly real and more than just a plot device.This film succeeds in all aspects, including the ending which is often said to be overlong and unecessary. Without hearing the inner thoughts of Bates, however, would leave a gaping hole in the production. The double image of Bates face with his mother's scull remains chilling, even in today's glorified, Natural Born Killers-like ultraviolence. Hitch's direction and shot techniques are as innovative as those seen in some of his earlier films like Vertigo and North-by-Northwest. Next time you watch Psycho, slow down the shower scene just to see how many separate shots Hitch put together to make it so great. Quite calculated.It's a shame that a film like Psycho had to have been marred by a few sequels and a terribly awful shot-by-shot remake. Unlike a continuing storyline like that of ""The Godfather"", this story should have ended here.Full recommendation.9/10 stars."
mr.pink-4,"Jan 26, 1999",10/10,"Anything i would say has already been said but still it's worth crediting this masterpiece again. What else would you want with a movie great direction, superb acting,great set,great story With one of the best acting performances of our time Anthony Perkins created something that other actors have never been able to accomplish that is successfully he made someone you'd never suspect. Sure you might have thought him to be the one when you first saw it but he crafted a man whose emotions you would think would definitely help his mother but wouldn't join with her Hitchcock who is also the best director of all time sends a never again greatly crafted 100 K Diamond to the screen with a magnificiant  SHING!!! of the blade"
Psychett,"Jun 18, 1999",10/10,"I have watched this film about four times now, and I can safely say that this is the best horror movie ever. The actors are the best thing about it. Anthony Perkins is superb as the shy, gorgeous, boyish Norman Bates. His twitchings and stammerings are scarily flawless, and the scene where the car stops momentarily sinking into the swamp, and he stares with a look of pure terror in his eyes, then ultimate relief when it continues are unforgettable. His ""...I wouldn't even harm a fly"" face at the end is inimitable. As for Janet Leigh, she couldn't have gotten into her part more. She looks genuinely desperate when confronted by the police officer. Hitchcock controls the audience as if he were pressing keys on a piano with this film. Everything is perfect about this film, and has become one of my personal favourites. If you haven't seen it, see it now."
S6F,"May 24, 2021",7/10,"Yeah yeah its a classic but in the current time it's not that impressive, it's still fun to watch, had one decent plot twist at the end, at the time it was the best, now it's an decent horror film with some mystery."
killer13,"Apr 20, 2000",5/10,Psycho**[2 Stars]- There is nothing good or bad about this movie. Its just an ok movie. The acting isn't great nor bad. But Anthony Perkins gives an excellent performance as Norman Bates and theres nothing great about any of the other actors. Also the shower scene is effective but it should have been longer. If you're a major Alfred Hitchock fan than I would recommend this movie to you but if not than skip this and go on to 'Psycho 2***[3 Stars]''.
walrus-5,"Jan 29, 1999",10/10,"Can anyone not be frightened by this masterpiece? It's being almost 40 years since the release of this Hitchcock classic, and it's still scary. And it's not just scary, it's also revolutionary and intelligent, like no one else can do. Alfred Hitchcock gives us a perfect technical motion picture, in the camera movements, cinematography, editing (how can you not get thrilled in the shower scene) and special effects, with a surprising and inspired screenplay, that keeps the viewer hypnotized the whole length of the film, a music score that matches the film perfectly, a display of the human experience, with greed, betrayal, sexuality, repression, morality, insanity, instinct, desire, violence, motherhood and passion, and outstanding performances by Anthony Perkins and Janet Leigh, without mentioning the rest of the cast, which is great too. This is just a few comments on one of my top 5 films of all time, but now I gotta go. Need to take a shower."
Chuck-149,"Aug 16, 1999",10/10,"This is what great thrillers are all about.  It's rather hard to tell a lot about this masterpiece without spoiling some of the surprises contained in it but I'll try my best to spoil as little as possible.This is definitely Hitchcock's best picture and it's really great.  For this movie, Hitchcock took many actors that were rather unknowns and made them movie stars by having perfectly directed them.  Plus, the idea and the script are exceptional and don't have any flaws.  And if that's not enough for you, just think of all the people that are afraid to take showers when they are all alone in their houses because of the traumatizing shower in the movie.  Anthony Perkins is brilliant as the hermit called Norman Bates who lives alone with his ""mother"".It's pure genius and keeps you guessing until the end.  Martin Balsam and Janet Leigh are excellent as well in their supporting roles.  A sequel was made but I recommend only the first one (Hitchcock didn't direct the second one anyway).  You must see it."
Mulder-51,"Aug 18, 1999",10/10,After all these years Alfred Hitchcock decided to make himself the master of horror. Psycho is the film that terrified the generation of '60.But the weird and spectacular thing about Psycho is that it can terrify as well our generation. When I first saw this film I could not have a shower for at least one week! I had the impression that Norman Bates could kill me at any moment. Sir Alfred Hitchcock is the master of horror!
RJ-21,"Nov 26, 1998",10/10,"This film is without doubt a classic.  One of very few films to maintain any sort of mystery and suspense despite its ageing. Some films stand the test of time, and Psycho is brilliant.  It freaked me out when I first saw it, despite everything: black and white, actors I'd never heard of, and my first Hitchcock experience.  If you haven't seen it, you're either too scared or haven't had the opportunity, but either way, you're doing yourself a great disservice."
RobertF87,"Jan 16, 2005",10/10,"This film has to rank as probably one of the most influential films ever made. It's one of those films that is referenced constantly. By the way, this is a film where the less you know about it beforehand, the more powerful it is. In fact in the original advertising, Hitchcock asked viewers not to reveal the film's shocks to their friends afterwards, and also that viewers had to be seated from the beginning of the film (when ""Psycho"" was released people were in the habit of walking into movies at any point). As a result, i will try my best not to give too much away.Based on a fairly good thriller by Robert Bloch, inspired by the life and crimes of real-life serial killer Ed Gein, this movie constantly unsettles the viewer. Hitchcock knew about suspense and he knew how to manipulate an audience which he does here brilliantly. Almost everything in this film is pitch perfect and the shocks are still striking. The actors, especially the brilliant Anthony Perkins, are all superb. Special note has to be taken of the famous score by Bernard Herrmann.Whether or not you're a horror movie fan, this is a must-see."
BeamMeUp,"Nov 4, 1998",10/10,"The first time I saw this movie it scared me incredibly.  I have been an avid fan of the ""Scream"" movies since they first came out, and I must say, this movie surpasses them to be #1 on my favorite horror movies.I wasn't expecting many scares from a movie made in 1960, but once again, Alfred Hitchcock proves why he is the Master of Suspense.I don't know how the upcoming remake can accurately mimic the original's creepy and frightening feeling, but I'll still be there on opening weekend. BTW, make sure you watch the original BEFORE watching the remake.I know you've heard it a thousand times, but if you haven't seen this movie, MAKE IT A TOP PRIORITY!  It's simply incredible."
Falko_h1,"Jun 1, 2024",7/10,"""Psycho,"" directed by Alfred Hitchcock, is a seminal work in the thriller genre that continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. The film follows Marion Crane (Janet Leigh), a secretary who embezzles money and ends up at the eerie Bates Motel, run by the enigmatic Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). What unfolds is a chilling tale that redefined horror and suspense in cinema.Hitchcock's direction is meticulous, employing innovative techniques to build tension and unease. The infamous shower scene is a testament to his skill, creating a sense of terror without explicit gore. Bernard Herrmann's haunting score is iconic, its screeching violins adding to the film's menacing atmosphere.Anthony Perkins delivers a haunting performance as Norman Bates, portraying a complex character with a disarming charm and underlying darkness. Janet Leigh's portrayal of Marion is compelling, making her sudden exit all the more shocking and effective.""Psycho"" is more than just a horror film; it's a psychological exploration of human nature and madness. While some elements might feel dated, its impact on the genre and its ability to disturb and intrigue remain undiminished. For anyone interested in classic cinema, ""Psycho"" is a must-watch, offering a blend of suspense, horror, and masterful storytelling."

elvircorhodzic,"Mar 7, 2017",10/10,"PSYCHO is a psychological thriller with elements of horror in which tension is gradually giving way to a sort of creeps. It is based on the novel of the same name by Robert Bloch.During a lunchtime in Phoenix, a real estate secretary discusses with her boyfriend how they cannot afford to get married because of his debts. Forty thousand dollars in cash accidentally come into her hands. This is a great temptation for a young and unhappy woman. Her boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank. She instinctively takes the money and plans an escape to a new life. California is a famous destination of most of the fugitives. She has, because of the strong cuff, decided to spend the night in a small motel. A pleasant dinner with an attentive owner of the motel will be the last in her life...The story is very tense and shocking. It has offered some of iconic climax in the genre. Mr. Hitchcock did not give up from a classical narrative. He has managed, regardless of the situation and the probability to transfer tensions from one character to another. Hitch has paid attention to small details. The secret of the main plot lies in these details.A ghostly atmosphere has completely corresponded with violence, deviant behavior and sexuality. The soundtrack is excellent. All the protagonists are changing throughout the film. It is a kind of trap by Mr. Hitchcock. Compassion and understanding toward one of the antagonists in the film are certainly possible. However, a viewer loses a firm stance with regard to any kind of identification with the main antagonist. We hear a voice of the killer, we know some of his features, we are witnesses of his murder, but we do not see a clear character.Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates has offered an excellent and intriguing performance. The duality in his character has reflected through a family melodrama, violence by parents and a psychotic obsession. His unpredictability and alienation can cause a fear and admiration at the same time.Janet Leigh as Marion Crane is quite convincing in the role of an insecure and nervous woman.Both characters are in strong conflict with themselves. Norman has struggled with obsession and fear. Marion has tried to overcome her own passion and discomfort. He is completely disturbed person, who can not make decisions alone. She is an unfortunate woman who tries to escape from everyday life.The film has become unique in the combination of a sophisticated music and upcoming murder scene. Hitch has, in an intriguing way, played with the human psyche."
bobsgrock,"May 31, 2009",10/10,"One of the most famous of all films, so much so that people who have never seen it know about the shower scene, or can quote, ""A boy's best friend is his mother."" Yet, Psycho is so much more than ""that scary movie with the shower scene."" In fact, it is not even a horror film by any stretch of the imagination; Hitchcock was too sophisticated for that. This is a mystery thriller, the first part being thriller and the second being mystery.One of the elements that make this a timeless piece of cinema is the way Hitchcock sets up the back story to the character of Marion Crane and the relationship between her and Norman Bates. From the moment these stories begin, we start to get involved without knowing that Hitchcock is toying with us. I cannot ruin any spoilers, since this is a film to enjoy the first time and then maybe a second time. But, it is important to know that even though this has influenced practically every horror movie since, it is nothing like any of them. Hitchcock shot in black and white to not appear gory and used old-school tricks like music and editing to create images in our mind much scarier than on the screen.Speaking of music, has there ever been a more perfect score written for a film since this masterful work by Bernard Herrmann? In every scene it is used, it underlies the drama and increases the suspense in a way no modern director could ever do with blood and grotesque imagery.The cast is wonderful, especially Janet Leigh as Marion and Anthony Perkins as Norman. As good as Leigh is in bringing us to her side, Perkins gives arguably one of the greatest performances in all of cinema. The little details, the stuttering, the twitching, the eyes moving all around go unnoticed the first few times. Then, after awhile you notice it and see that he almost completely makes us sympathize with this character. If you've seen this before, you know what an incredible job it is, although it is a shame Perkins never got out from under Bates' shadow. What is even worse is that they made three sequels to this movie, focusing more on Norman and the violence that I am sure ensued. Forget those attempts to capture your attention and be sure to view this masterpiece at least once. That's all it takes before you will look at your mother a little differently."
saeedahmedsasoli,"Nov 28, 2020",10/10,"Is it the best Hitchcock movie? It's definitely one of his best, right up there with ""The 39 Steps"" and ""Strangers On A Train"" and ""Sabotage"" and ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" He only once again came close to making as good a film, with ""The Birds,"" while Janet Leigh and Anthony Perkins never escaped the greatness they helped create here. Poor John Gavin had to quit the biz entirely, and became an ambassador.The movie was adapted from a novel so some of the original audience would have been familiar with the plot of the book. In the novel, Norman Bates was a middle-aged man. I think it was a brilliant stroke to have the Norman of the film as a man in his twenties, a boy who never grew up in a man's body. Anthony Perkins is so identified today with his role of Norman Bates that it was surprising to see how endearingly he played him in the early scenes. And he did one of the best stammers I've ever seen in a movie when he was being questioned by the private detective (Martin Balsam) who is also searching for Marion. I also wasn't expecting to see how protective the local sheriff and his wife were of Norman when they were being questioned about him and his mother. You could tell they didn't want somebody (Norman) whom they thought had been dealt a bad hand to have anymore publicity and scrutiny than he already had.I keep using the word brilliant, but I cannot hide my enthusiasm for this movie. It is wholly unlike the overblown, overbudget, overlong fluff spewing all-too-often out of Hollywood today. ""Psycho"" is simple, well-crafted and just the right length.It's easy to take PSYCHO for granted now; it has been imitated so many times in so many ways by far lesser talents. Indeed, it's one negative is that it inspired so may pale imitations, including its own three sequels and a very bad remake. Yet even so, PSYCHO remains a one and only original. And its iconic status can't be denied; it redefined the concepts of what a Hitchcock film was and what a horror film could be."
kevin_sheehan_,"Nov 2, 2025",10/10,"I had the pleasure of seeing this film for the second time with a live orchestra and on Halloween night which made it even more special. Hearing the phenomenal score live while watching the film was just amazing.When it came to the famous shower scene the orchestra did not disappoint at all. Hearing the high pitch violin piece live was exceptional. I actually only realised during the performance that the score is string instruments only which is pretty interesting.Since this was only my second time watching the film I forgot about some things that happen throughout it. So in a way it was a somewhat first experience.Overall, this is a fantastic film and a massively enjoyable watch. It is a perfect Halloween night film.""She might have fooled me, but she didn't fool my mother.""Norman Bates."
mslabeau,"Jun 12, 2015",7/10,"The plot was small, but interesting and I enjoyed how the scenes were shot and cut, but considering how this is not the early 60's anymore, people shouldn't watch the movie if they want to get scared because the story itself isn't all that thrilling, not because it was badly written, but because the plot twists have been dulled due to their being so famous now. Janet Leigh, a popular name back in the day and Jamie Lee Curtis's mother, has enough screen time for her character to be better appreciated and Anthony Perkins's portrayal of Norman Bates is both amiable and creepy. I would recommend watching the movie as a regular movie rather than a horror movie because the picture is still beautiful and the story is interesting, but it's just not all that scary anymore."

But she makes the fatal mistake of stopping at the Bates Motel for the night.One of the best films of all time; presenting terrfic direction, striking sets, memorable lines, and one heck of a shower scene.

This film has great suspense while not going into the horror genre. The editing and camera cuts to different angles really builds the suspense. This music used in the film really deepens the eerie feeling you get while watching. This movie shows Hitchcock at his finest, the shower scene is now iconic and the twists and turns in the plot make this movie unpredictable in the best way."
hayden_boxing,"May 4, 2014",8/10,"I generally find the oldest movies are overrated just because they are ""classics"" but this truly is a classic. It may be slower than most modern movies today, although you really follow the plot, and feel the evil and insanity that lies within Norman Bates. The only problem I found with this movie was it had a little bit of a slow start. Once the movie gets rolling though it becomes a suspenseful thriller filled with memorable scenes, some you may have seen with out even watching the movie. The movie contains a great sequel 22 years later that holds up just as good as the first. You will feel like this was the first real horror movie ever made (although it's actually not) This truly is a timeless classic. If your a horror fan or even just a movie fan in general you must watch this, you want regret it."

jamiecostelo58,"Jan 15, 2007",10/10,"Psycho is THE ultimate horror movie. What a brilliantly told story and equally powerful acting from all concerned. This movie details the aspects of shock and the macabre to chilling effect, and surely scared the wits out of cinema-goers back in 1960! Of course back then, a gruesome murder wasn't really seen on film before, not such a gruesome killing anyway, but it's highly common today. Hitchcock delivers a heart-stopping, gripping movie which doesn't let down for a single second. It's much better that the film was released in black and white; had it had been in colour, the fear and suspense may have been lost to some effect.Janet Leigh portrayed Marion Crane with wonderful agility, but we all know the real star of the show was (and is) Anthony Perkins. Norman Bates is probably the most twisted and scariest characters in the history of film, and Perkins delivers the vulnerabilities we see in Bates to stunning effect. I have huge respect for Vera Miles, and she was also well cast as Marion's concerned sister, Lila. A very underrated actress.The suspense to Psycho starts right from the word go, what with the extremely haunting music to the opening titles, which continues in certain scenes throughout the film. An equally powerful and shocking ending too...Psycho is simply the ultimate horror movie, it hasn't been bettered, and cannot be bettered. The gruesome 'shower scene' featured not one violent shot - just illusion. But boy what illusion! Terrific, brilliant, excellent, superb, I can't go on enough!"
RileyLikesMovies,"Oct 4, 2021",10/10,"""Psycho"" is a 1960 thriller film, directed by the famous Alfred Hitchcock, and is an extremely weird and creepy movie but is excellently done. It's about a secretary who steals 40,000 pounds from her boss and while on the run stops at the only motel she can she through the pouring windshield Bates Motel, and the owner of the hotel has a unusual relationship with his mother. The movie is extremely famous and is probably Hitchcock's most notable film of his career.The acting, Plot, and movie in general is amazing, it was based of a book in 1959 and nowadays Psycho is still watched to this day and is enjoyed by many people who view it.10/10!"
nickdove,"Mar 27, 2003",5/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Psycho"" has gone down in history as one of the most psychologically disturbing thrillers ever made. I strongly disagree. I started this movie fully expecting to be disturbed and scared, but finished it feeling robbed. The problem with this movie is the hype. Had it not been hyped as the scariest film ever made, than it would have gone over better. But as it stands, Psycho DOESN'T stand. Back in 1960, movie-going Americans were not at all expecting this, had never seen anything like this, and were probably very shocked when they did. This movie started the endless number of slasher-type films we know today, such as ""Halloween"", and the Jason series. Of them, I can't say Psycho is any better. Hitchcock does well with the cinematography, but falls short in the suspense area. His predecessors, such as Ridley Scott (Alien), Robert Zemeckis (What Lies Beneath), and many others succeeded where he failed. The acting in Psycho is pretty good, though sometimes mechanical. Bottom-line: If you have NEVER seen a horror film, particularly of the slasher type, than you will find this a chilling film. But for modern, decensitized America, it will only be looked at as a good B-movie."
NPG,"May 15, 2000",N/A,"this film is a masterpiece of suspense, semi-horror, and mostof all romance. All three are haunting as they are placed through Hitchcock's outstanding touches and twists.In the first viewing by you, it will probably be a suspense thriller. The 2nd and 3rd viewings will put interesting questions in your mind like ""Will Marion go with Norman or Sam?"" or ""What ever happens to Norman later on?"" (of course two sequels were made to solve this one)but most of all this movie should be remembered for being based on probably the greatest murderer of our time named Ed Gein (who is even more psychopath than this movie describes him as). This film is the most haunting film I have seen, Halloween, Scream, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, and I Know What You Did Last Summer are all just a bunch of stupid bloody teen flicks. But this film is a piece of art."
lucasbusby,"Sep 14, 2019",10/10,"A Masterpiece By A Genius is all I have to say, this is something that everyone must see atleast once. The suspense is superb and it shows that you don't need SFX to have a good horror just a good idea. I'm only 13 and I appreciate this so much, just to think that it were made in the 1950-60s. A much watch for absolutely everyone!"
davidmetzer,"May 12, 2022",10/10,Janet Leigh plays a bank teller who goes missing after she steals money. Her sister and boyfriend have to find out what happened to her which leads them to the Bates Motel which is run by a strange mother and son who have a few secrets of their own. A mid-film twist still packs a punch and Bernard Hermann's string heavy score will jangle your nerves.
mklvntwar,"Jun 28, 2021",7/10,"Psycho takes place in December , yet not a Christmas decoration in sight and no one makes reference to the Yuletide season. Other then that good for it's time , but the film has aged and the plot holes have become magnified. Still wondering how Bates didn't suffer any financially with so very few customers. What income did he live on?"
cgvsluis,"Oct 27, 2025",6/10,"While Psycho is known as a Hitchcock classic it is not my favorite by any means. I would argue that Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt and even The Trouble with Harry are all superior films.There are some interesting aspects to Psycho that make it worth watching. The opening scene for starters was pretty risqué for it's time showing an unmarried woman in a state of undress in a cheap motel on her lunch break for what is clearly a quickie with her divorced out of towner boyfriend. The two have a fairly intimate conversation with Janet Leigh (Marion Crane) in her bra and slip and John Gavin (Sam Loomis) with his bare chest. The two discuss the fact that with the alimony that Sam is paying and his current debts, he can't afford to marry Marion.Marion returns to work only to have one of her boss' clients flirt with her and whip out $40,000 in cash, the money her boss tells her to put in their safe deposit box in the bank. She asks to go home afterwards and proceeds to abscond with the money. Marion ends up on a wet and rainy night at the Bates Motel, which used to be on the main highway...but is now off the beaten path.Marion is checked in by Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins), who seems like a likable fellow...the two have kind of a sweet conversation in the parlor over food.""We all go a little mad sometimes.""-NormanAfter their conversation Marion decides to go home and return the money in the morning. Only then Norman notices she used a different name in the registration book and we see her in the shower...also pretty risqué for the time, where she is stabbed repeatedly until dead by a somewhat obscured assailant who we are lead to believe is Norman's mother.This brings me to the second interesting thing about this film. When it was in theaters Hitchcock insisted that no one be let into the theater after the film had begun. A real change from how films were viewed up until that time with individuals routinely coming in during all parts of films and then staying until the part that they came in on comes up again before leaving the theater. This started a new age of seeing films in theaters from the beginning. Hitchcock's insistence was to prevent several secrets about the film from getting leaked, thus ruining the film for its spectators.I'm sorry to say without knowing the secrets, I was able to figure out who the REAL killer is and frankly it was Norman's fascination with taxidermy that gave it away.I really enjoyed John Gavin in this film. I thought he played an excellent concerned boyfriend as did Vera Miles play an equally concerned sister, Lila Crane. Personally, I thought Janet Leigh's performance was a little too frenzied with the exception of the opening scene with John Gavin. Now let's talk about Anthony Perkins...phenomenal. It is easy to see why he had trouble getting romantic leading roles after this film, he did such a wonderful job playing this mentally deranged individual. As kind and innocent as he played, he has this particular head tilt and look that sends chills down my spine he is so creepy. This is distinctly a defining role for Perkins.I do think Psycho is worth seeing once and that Hitchcock fans and maybe fans of horror will appreciate it. My final note as a forensic scientist, there was not nearly enough blood for the kind of stabbing that we witness...shower or no shower. I did like the clean up attempt, however."

barbapapa-2,"Nov 27, 2023",10/10,"Psycho is a masterpiece of suspense and horror that has stood the test of time. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, the film tells the story of Marion Crane, a young woman who steals money from her employer and ends up at the Bates Motel, run by the mysterious Norman Bates.The movie is a perfect example of Hitchcock's mastery of the craft. The film's screenplay, written by Joseph Stefano, is a work of art, filled with twists and turns that keep the audience guessing until the very end. The movie's score, composed by Bernard Herrmann, is also a standout, adding to the film's suspense and tension. Pay particular attention to the film's use of colour and light - although black and white, you'll notice things like Marion wearing white vs. Black at times, which I won't get into for fear of spoilers, and shadows galore.The movie's cast is also excellent. Janet Leigh delivers a standout performance as Marion Crane, while Anthony Perkins is unforgettable as Norman Bates. Un. For. Gettable. The film's supporting cast, including Vera Miles and John Gavin, is also excellent.Overall, Psycho is a movie that is not to be missed. The film's clever screenplay, excellent direction, and outstanding cast make it a must-see movie. I highly recommend it!"
adil-iqbal77,"Dec 28, 2015",10/10,"There are rarely any movies that revolutionize a whole genre. Hitchcock's Psycho is undoubtedly one such movie. The movie unfolds at a pace which is perfect according to modern standards. It is a guarantee you'll be spiked on your seats for the entire length of the movie. The acting is outclass with special reference being to Anthony Perkins, the stammering motel manager and of course Vera Miles (also John Gavins acting for me). Hitchcock brings out his best direction techniques and methods in this movie. Everything about this movie just stands out, its cinematography, acting, direction, story telling.. just everything. The plot, though simple, is created with so much suspense that you'll be submerged into the movie. The climax may well be the best we have ever seen (not even comparable to climax in The Usual Suspects). For the climax alone i would rank the movie 10/10. This is one horror/mystery movie that revolutionized the way mystery movies were made. All assured, Vera Miles' screaming picture would be etched in your mind for a long time. A definite watch."
cricketbat,"Oct 19, 2021",10/10,"I consider Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho to be a perfect movie. Not a frame is wasted in this iconic thriller. This film skillfully introduces relatable characters and develops engaging plotlines, and it masterfully builds suspense before pulling the rug (or shower curtain) out from under you. This is my favorite Hitchcock film. And if you happen to find someone who doesn't know the twists and turns of this terrifying tale, it's so much fun to introduce them to Norman Bates and his mother."
RwRobo,"Jul 8, 2001",10/10,"""Psycho"" stands alone in the realm of horror and thriller movies. It is one of the few that delivers to fear and feeling into the misbegotten souls of it's characters. Director Alfred Hitchcock delivers superb direction and forces you to put your trust in ""Psycho""'s many seedy characters. Anthony Perkins delivers the performance of a lifetime as Norman Bates, the poor pawn of his 'mother'. The film, brilliantly shot in B&W, has become a staple in any movie lover's eye. The entire story revolves around the theft of 400,000 by one Marion Crane(Janet Leigh). This theft entangles her sister(Vera Miles), her lover(John Gavin), a private eye(Martin Balsam), a sheriff(John McIntire), and a lonely hotel manager(Perkins). ""Psycho"" is capable of being rewatched over and over again with little secrets hidden through out. Each character holds some secret: Marion stole some money, Gavin is seeing her on the side, Marion's coworker took tranquilers on her wedding night, her boss has alcohol in the office, client holds undeclared money from the IRS, and Norman has the biggest sequel of all. ""Psycho"" also contains the greatest score of all time which contains only strings which was wonderfully composed by the late Bernard Hermann as well as the best directed scene of all time, the infamous shower scene. I believe ""Psycho"" is the greatest film of all time. I give it a 10/10."

Prince-P,"Oct 14, 2022",6/10,"The '50s had been something of a success story for Alfred Hitchcock. He had done some great films, with some huge stars. Gary Grant, Ingrid Bergman, James Stewart, Grace Kelly and Henry Fonda had all worked for him. In 1955, he also started ""Alfred Hitchcock Presents"", a TV show with millions of viewers. But now it was 1960. The director wanted to try something new.In ""Psycho,"" Anthony Perkins plays a repressed young man named Norman Bates. He seems completely dominated by his disabled mother, but still tries to manage his run-down motel as best he can. One day, an attractive young woman (Janet Leigh) walks through the front door, setting in motion a fateful sequence of events.Unfortunately, Paramount Pictures wasn't interested in the new project. In a desperate attempt to get ""Psycho"" made, Hitchcock offered to pay for the shooting himself if the company guaranteed to distribute the finished film. And ultimately Paramount said yes. Convinced that ""Psycho"" would be a box-office flop they also agreed to Hitchcock's demand for a 60% cut of the film's (unlikely) profit.Hitchcock immediately set to work. To keep costs down, he only used personnel from his own TV series behind the cameras. And he shot the whole movie in black and white on a spare movie set. With a budget of $800,000, ""Psycho"" was the cheapest film Hitchcock ever produced.Surprisingly, the picture became a smash hit at the cinemas. Thanks to his deal with Paramount, Hitchcock personally earned over $15 million from the box office. In the coming years, ""Psycho"" also became a successful franchise with three more new films, as well as a color remake of the original. Not bad for a tiny little flick that the movie company hadn't even believed in."
tbugera,"Apr 22, 2023",4/10,"""Psycho"" was definitely a decent film, no surprise as it was made by the great Hitchcock at the top of his game. But the film was just too predictable and had too many laughs where they were not supposed to be.I mean seriously. I can't speak for the crowds in 1960, but if anyone watches this for the first time today, it's pretty obvious where this entire picture is going after we go to the motel for the first time. The title itself is clue enough (he's a ""psycho"" after all) but really, I can't see anyone not guessing the big 'secret' of this flick way before the ending.The film's main characters are cast superbly. Janet Leigh looks great and sexy, keeping the film from being too boring because she's so beautiful and good on screen. And of course Anthony Perkins does a pretty decent job. He doesn't give the awe-inspiring heart-stopping performance that fans of the flick seem to think he gives, but he is very good indeed.The ingredients of the movie are put together very nicely, with the music and editing utilized for the maximum effect. Hitchcock definitely shows why he's known as such a great talent in these respects, putting it all together beautifully.Unfortunately, the film suffers from too many laughs where they aren't supposed to be. When Norman first indicated he's a little ""psycho,"" it's very funny watching him and his serious face as he gives clues he's such a nut case. With ""Mother,"" whenever ""she"" talks (and yells), it's just too funny not to laugh at it. Even the scene when Norman carries ""Mother"" form her room is funny, as she talks her nonsense as he carries her out with her legs dangling."
Hal-77,"May 18, 1999",N/A,"Let's face it, Alfred Hitchcock was a genius! He managed to capture the true demented character of Norman Bates. In the 90's Psycho does not seem to be one of the scariest movies around. But the way Hitchock managed the lighting and camera angles, made it so obvious why this movie became such a hit. I just saw this movie a few months ago, and even then, everyone I watched it with seemed delighted to scream again at the geinius of Alfred Hitchcock."
msnakeairsoft,"Jan 28, 2022",10/10,"What makes Psycho immortal, when so many films are already half-forgotten as we leave the theatre, is that it connects directly with our fears: Our fears that we might impulsively commit a crime, our fears of the police, our fears of becoming the victim of a madman, and of course our fears of disappointing our mothers."
breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com,"May 16, 2014",10/10,"There's a lot to say about Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho (1960). For one thing, it would not have lit the fuse to the explosion of other unique slasher villains that everyone comes to know and enjoy at the movies. As crazy as this idea was back in the day, Hitchcock was able to push the boundaries of suspense and create a legend that practically no one can forget. Thankfully everything here is put together in such a way that it amounts to a very clever, creepy and disturbing movie.The story is about a girl named Marion Crane (Janet Leigh) who is given a huge sum of money and is expected to deposit in the bank. However, she becomes greedy and decides to run off with it. While on her escape, she decides to rest at an old motel owned by a man named Norman Bates (Anthony Perkins). There she learns that Norman is under the strict rule of his mother and that he's a slight bit unsettling. However, she doesn't realize how unsettling Norman really is. Co-starring Perkins and Leigh are several other veteran actors like Vera Miles, John Gavin, Martin Balsam and John McIntire.The writing is based off of Robert Bloch's work of the same name. Bloch himself had based it off of the disturbing real story of Ed Gein of Plainfield Wisconsin in 1957. What's great though is that Hitchcock kept everything identical to the book. Every scene that is depicted gives momentum to the plot and helps make the tension that much more gripping. The best actor here is Anthony Perkins. Not only are his reactions real but also feel genuine. For example, when telling a lie and then being found out, he tries to cover his tracks. He is able to do so but speaks nervously.As for the year, 1960 had some graphic violence come into play. Not enough to shock anyone, but creative enough to let the audiences' imagination run wild. Also, just because the film is in black and white doesn't mean for any viewer who doesn't like the ""old"" films, can't be entertained either. With the simplicity of color, there are other things for the viewer to watch and notice. Having only black and white actually simplifies the viewing experience for the audience. Accompanying that is Bernard Herrmann's all string score, with one of the most iconic tunes taking place in a shower scene. If you want to know where slasher films began, it's here.Norman Bates is the original slasher villain. Audiences will be clinging to the disturbing story, the acting is great and the music is memorable."

The real horror lies within the suspense that the movie contains. Some scenes are shocking.Hitchcock is a real legend in the world of horror, and it's very evident in this movie. If you haven't seen Psycho yet, don't bother calling yourself a real horror fan. It's a must see for horror fans of all ages and it's the iconic, classic horror film."

torrascotia,"Sep 30, 2023",6/10,"I eventually got round to watching what is probably the most famous Hitchcock movie and I have to say it was a bit of a let down. While the story is obvious to anyone who hasn't been living as a hermit their entire life, I still should have been able to engage with this movie much better than I did. Its simply not in the same league as something like Rear Window.While the movie does have a few great stand out scenes overall it doesn't have the same grip you come to expect from Hitch. The first act focuses on a woman who rips off her boss to the tune of 40 grand, she's also an adulterer so you obviously don't care for her, but then the movie does a 180 and focuses on Norman Bates. This is quite a jarring switch and seems a very odd choice in terms of narration. I would also argue that the conclusion is a huge let down. There is a minor action scene and then we are subjected to what I can only describe as a psychobabble explanation of why Norman is why he is. But unfortunately its complete nonsense, there is no such thing as a ""split personality"" and the psychiatrists speech is pure bunkum. Had they bothered to write a story about someone with an actual diagnosable DSM/ICD illness and write the story around that, then sure. But to basically invent a mental illness and have some pretend psychiatrist take up the final act talking nonsense is unforgivable. While I am sure it may impress some people who have no clue about mental health, the Norman Bates case is laughable to anyone who knows about mental health.The pros of this movie are the cinematography and a couple of stand out scenes. The negatives are the entirely fictitious mental health issues and the ropey script. This isn't an 8.5 out of 10 movie, it's not even an 8.5 in terms of Hitchcock. Its a just above average thriller that is unlikely to shock or thrill the way it may have in the 60's."

Justin765,"Jun 26, 2014",10/10,"Is Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho a masterpiece? In short yes, and is one movie to define a genre for decades.Psycho is the story of a young woman running from a bad decision.

On the run from a team of private investigators she comes across the Bates Motel, a hotel in the middle of nowhere ran by Norman Bates. Norman lives alone with only his mother, a mentally disturbed woman. This simple story will progress into one of the most thrilling films of the twentieth century.Alfred Hitchcock directs this terrifying tale with expertise; no detail is left to wonder with all credit due to this monumental director. The script is also top notch with every scene feeling unique and engrossing. I have to say there is one scene in particular that will forever haunt my imagination. To compliment the excellent direction is solid performances by all of the actors, the standout being Anthony Perkins as Norman Bates.This masterpiece of the cinema is in every way phenomenal, it will leave you terrified to take a shower and in awe of the plots complexity."
inkblot11,"Jul 3, 2019",10/10,"Marion (Janet Leigh) works for a real estate agent and earns, most likely, very little bucks in the late fifties. She loves a handsome gentleman named Sam (John Gavin) but, alas, his divorce has left his prospects dim, as a good deal of his money goes to his ex-wife. In fact, he lives in another California town, behind the hardware store he runs. Marion is getting tired of meeting Sam in cheap hotels and listening to his weak promises. One day, a crooked businessman comes in with $40,000 cash for a house he is buying for his daughter, who is marrying soon. Marion's boss is aghast to hold this much money so he sends Marion to the bank on a Friday afternoon. The money never gets deposited. Going a bit ""crazy"", Marion takes the cash and runs north, thinking this will allow Sam to marry her. But, a heavy downpour makes Marion stop at an out-of-the-way motel, The Bates. Greeted by the motel's owner, Norman ( a superb Anthony Perkins), Marion soon learns she is the only guest and is given the best room. Norman even brings her a meal, over the objections of his mother, who Marion sees in a window and hears from the 'big house"" behind the motel. After she eats, Marion decides maybe she should take the money back in the morning and steps into the shower. Suddenly and ghastly, Marion is stabbed to death by, its assumed, Norman's mother. Norman cleans the place up and sinks Marion's car, along with the money, into a pond near the motel. All too soon, Sam and Marion's sister Lila (Vera Miles) are looking for her. A private eye goes snooping, too, hired by the man with the bucks, for he can't notify the police. When the PI gets to the Bates, Norman's mother makes short work of him, too. Another car goes swimming and sinks. But, when Sam and Lila likewise trail Marion to the Bates, will more deaths ensue? Is there bigger secrets afoot? You bet! This classic tale of a psychosis and murder is rightly one of Hitchcock's most famous films. DEFINITELY SCARIER THAN SCARY, many folks never take a shower again after viewing it. Perkins is beyond great as the weird Norman and Leigh, Gavin, and Miles do their parts quite nicely. The twist at the end is compelling while, even in black and white, the film's production is stunning. Don't miss this one if you dare!"
wmnzr,"Oct 17, 2021",10/10,"""Psycho"" is the kind of movie that you really have to make sure that you see if you're going to be the kind of people who want to talk about the history of Hollywood movies. Like some others, Mr. Hitchcock produced or directed quite a few famous films. The basic idea in this one is to tell the story of the strange things that happen after a woman checks in at a spooky old motel. In a way, many might claim that this movie by itself could show you that Mr. Hitchcock belongs having a reputation for doing the very highest quality work, but I'd especially recommend ""The Birds"" if you just can't resist a little more scary stuff. And try to get back to the car safely when you're all done!"
