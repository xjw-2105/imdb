Ben_Cheshire,"Feb 6, 2004",9/10,"If you ever watched Pulp Fiction and thought: movie cool was born here, or maybe you saw any single Sergio Leone movie and thought: this guy invented movie-cool (if you haven't, i thoroughly recommend it - Kill Bill is nothing to his Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West), then experience Yojimbo, or The Bodyguard. Kurosawa's camera sits behind Toshiro Mifune's man-with-no-name, inviting us to look up at the back of his head as he walks the earth, inviting us to be in awe of this man. And as he walks, super-cool walking-the-earth music plays. Later on, when he's taunted and asked to prove himself, he slices a guy's arm off and plays the petty, money-grabbing rival factions in the town he wanders into off each other.If you have it in your mind that a guy called Kurosawa couldn't make movies that would impress you, that the cultural gap would be too great - be assured that Kurosawa's movies are rife with Western values. Sure, they are rife with Japanese values (i am told), but Kurosawa had a great appreciation of Western culture. He based many of his movies on Western texts, like Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, or American gangster fiction and film. Yojimbo is one of the latter - inspired by the Dashiell Hammet novel Red Harvest (Hammett's novel The Maltese Falcon was put onscreen moment for moment by John Huston in the movie of the same name which immortalised Humphrey Bogart).Actually, the history of the story of the lone wolf, the wanderer with a weapon, who rides into town to play off two warring factions against each other - is quite a story itself. Dashiell Hammett, an American, wrote a novel with an American private eye as the stranger. In 1961, Akira Kurosawa transposed this story to medieval Japan, after the fall of a dynasty, where a Samurai finds himself with no place to go (at the beginning, we see him throw a branch up in the air and walk the direction it falls), and no master to serve. A bodyguard with no-one to protect. In 1964, Sergio Leone transposed the screenplay of Yojimbo (nearly word for word) to the spanish desert, and he brought along a young television actor named Clint Eastwood, and together they revolutionised the western with Fistfull of Dollars, and created an entire genre, the Spaghetti Western, which sported among its attributes a gritty, desolate landscape, and a cynical, postmodern lack-of-values ideology (traditional American westerns had quite plush landscapes and were always black and white (good and evil) in their value system. Despite the massive influence of Fistfull of Dollars, it pales in comparison to both its predecessor Yojimbo, and its sequals, For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But still, both Yojimbo and Fistful are iconic movies, and very cool movies.With cool music, a cool anti-hero, a fun script, and a visually spectacular canvas of an image, painted by the eye of an artist (it is said that Kurosawa storyboarded his movies in full-scale paintings), Yojimbo is one of the coolest movies ever made."
elvircorhodzic,"Apr 13, 2017",9/10,"YOJIMBO is an action drama about a rōnin who finds himself at the center of a conflict between the two crime lords.A hungry and tired rōnin wanders through a desolate Japanese countryside. Soon, he arrives in a small town. A local caterer advises him to leave because, two local clans fight every day on the streets. However, a stranger decides to stay. The situation in a town is very good for one rōnin. This is a good chance that he earns some money. However, he does not need a bloody money. He wants to destroy local crime lords...This tense story is full of lies, doubt, turning, pranks, blackmails and excellent fights. A careless and seemingly insensitive samurai is actually a peaceful and good man. Mr. Kurosawa has, under the influence of a western and noir, made a very exciting and visually impressive film. Of course, he has not neglected the significant situations that are related to the Japanese culture and tradition.Close-ups, almost perfectly, reflect an evil, arrogance, fear, invincibility and contempt on faces of some of the protagonists. There is a large number of villains, which are quite different in character.Toshiro Mifune (Kuwabatake Sanjuro) is a resourceful, interesting and determined as a wandering rōnin and master swordsman. He, apparently, enjoys in his machinations, however, his goal is extremely benevolent. He's kind of a lone hero, regardless of a tactical evil and theatrical swagger in his character.His support are Tatsuya Nakadai as Unosuke a wild and insolent gunslinger and the biggest threat to a samurai. He is interesting because he is a completely different character from Sanjuro. Kyū Sazanka (Ushitora) and Seizaburo Kawazu (Seibei) are fairly inconclusive as crime lords. However their primary relationship ""of a teacher and his student"", could be interesting. Isuzu Yamada as Orin is the the wife of Seibei. She is perhaps an initiator of conflicts. Daisuke Katō as Inokichi is a visually the most memorable character. A character, who is capable to commit a vicious murder, but also make the greatest stupidity.Simply, Mr. Kurosawa has managed to combine several styles in a small masterpiece."
Tigereyes,"Nov 11, 2001",N/A,"If I had to choose only one movie for film students to learn from, this would be it. Other films may be more profound, or their imagery more groundbreaking, but this one is so tightly constructed that nothing - not a frame, word, or gesture - is extraneous.Toshiro Mifune, one of the world's most charismatic actors, is perfection as a tough loner of a samurai who takes it upon himself to clean up a town corrupted by two gambling clans. Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.Kurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there's a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.A wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!"
Peach-2,"Sep 26, 1999",10/10,"Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft."
faraaj-1,"Oct 17, 2006",10/10,"Yojimbo, based on noir writer Dashiel Hammett's Red Harvest is a magnificently entertaining film. Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.Yojimbo (aka The Bodyguard) is one of the coolest and most stylish films ever made. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite actor, as the scruffy looking Samurai, Yojimbo has all of Kurosawa's qualities and none of the flaws. The music score is an essential element of the plot and strikingly good, but admittedly bettered by the Ennio Morricone version in the Spaghetti Western remake Fistful of Dollars. The visuals are great, from the samurai swordplay, to the desolate streets, the town crier announcing its 3 a.m. to the brutal torture scene.One of the unique things about Yojimbo is the central character. He is an anti-hero. We see him initially as a killer and a man greedy for money. But then, he saves a family by re-uniting mother and child and giving them all the money he was advanced. Mifune has never been cooler than in this film and Eastwood could only aspire to equal such a performance.Of the two remakes, I liked Fistful of Dollars for starting the Spaghetti Western genre, although Yojimbo is a far more superior and stylish film. The gangster version, Last Man Standing, was not very good and Bruce Willis made for a poor substitute to Yojimbo. This film looks fresh and undated even today - watch it!"
funkyfry,"Nov 9, 2002",10/10,"Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled.  Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting.  It's possible to see ""Yojimbo's"" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa's films, the fact that the characters' motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.Wonderful images, and skillful direction that keeps the pace of the storytelling tight and tells most of the story through images -- this is the kind of film that is so good it can be watched a silent film without losing too much of its impact or meaning.I think that if Kurosawa had spent more of his time in litigation and less making movies, he might have made a living for the rest of his life off all the movies that have ripped off this movie.  Certainly Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" character owes a lot to Mifune's contribution; not only in Leone's films (the first of which borrows its entire plot from Kurosawa; a court settlement ensued which made sure Kurosawa made most of the profits from ""Fistful of Dollars"" in Asia his own) but also in Eastwood's best film as a director -- ""High Plains Drifter"", which borrows scenes such as Eastwood's rebuke of the villagers from ""Yojimbo"".The really funny thing about all this, and what not too many American critics or audiences have noted, is that ""Yojimbo"" is itself a western.  All the ingredients for a western are here, and the film's plot and style obviously owe a debt to Zinnemann's ""High Noon"".  ""Yojimbo"" even borrows the device of time, setting up a confrontation at 3:00 a.m. as shouted by the town crier.  I like ""Yojimbo"" better than ""High Noon"", so I don't want to go too far into this line of thought...."
InzyWimzy,"Oct 28, 2002",10/10,"I just figured out why Toshirô Mifune is so mesmerizing to watch.  It's just the way he expresses himself.  This guy's amazing!I've been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it's getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he's in Gonji's place lying on the floor.  He doesn't brag, but when he goes into action, that's it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn't seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it's great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it's really funny).  Great thing too is he's not really a hero and he's not entirely a villain.  He doesn't hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have ""characters"" including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.Yojimbo's mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic."
OttoVonB,"Sep 17, 2002",10/10,"After a string of classic masterpieces, Kurosawa confronted his influences head-on. Throwing John Ford's Western aesthetics into a blender and painting them pitch black. The results are Yojimbo and its legacy.Yojimbo (""the bodyguard"") is the tale of a flea-ridden wandering swordsman, Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune, in his finest performance). He arrives at a gang-war ravaged town and starts hiring himself out to both sides, playing them off against another, in order to wipe all the scum out. Sound familiar?Even though Yojimbo the film is a thrilling ride and very funny dark comedy, it is hard to imagine what a bombshell this was for audiences at the time of its release. It is as far removed as can be from the then squeaky-clean aesthetic of samurai films: you can almost smell the sweat and the grime of the sordid town and characters. The action is fast and furious, enhanced by Kurosawa's deft use of telephoto lenses and Masaru Sato's avant-garde score. With all that, Yojimbo was a massive kick in the pants of a fossilized genre.It exploded beyond the confines of its own country and genre, forever influencing the very Westerns that had inspired it, particularly a new wave out of Spain and Italy at the time. One Sergio Leone copy/pasted the whole plot into his own revisionist Western and gave us the Dollars trilogy. The slightest of Spaghetti Western enthusiasts owes Kurosawa a debt of gratitude.As with all truly great work, its greatness exists even devoid of context, and for all the historical precedents it set, all Kurosawa wanted to make was an entertaining film. That he bloody well succeeded is the least you can say about Yojimbo."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 18, 2020",7/10,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that 'Yojimbo (1961)' is familiar if you've already seen 'A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)'; Leone's western is pretty much a shot for shot remake of the Kurasowa classic. Its long stretches of silence before a duel, its grimacing faces of weather-worn goons and its brief flashes of stylish violence all clearly inspired the design of the entire 'Dollars' trilogy. This is only really relevant to the experience of 'Yojimbo (1961)' if you watch the two movies in reverse (as it were), as they really are almost identical in narrative and tone. It's a good thing, then, that they're about as good as one another. This samurai story sees a nameless wanderer work his way between two feuding gang bosses, making as much money as possible and maybe just saving the people who really matter along the way. Mifune's protagonist is a bit of a blank slate, his underlying morals hidden behind a facade of unflinching toughness. For as good as he is with a blade, he rarely has to use it. This lack of action isn't a problem, however, as it simply makes the few fights there are all the more impactful. They're fast, frenetic and dirty, stained with beautifully shot black-and-white blood. There's a coldness about the killing that mightn't sit right with a good chunk of the audience and that's a valid criticism. Still, the thing moves fast enough that no cruelty is ever lingered on, focused on delivering a tight and engaging plot right from the start. It's an entertaining film, even if it isn't as deep or emotionally impactful as some of Kurosawa's other work. It's carefully crafted and stands the test of time, too. 7/10"
Platypuschow,"Oct 21, 2018",6/10,"At time of writing Yojimbo presently sits as the 115th highest rated movie on IMDB, it's not the only one of Tohos movies in there either. Generally I disagree with IMDB's top 250, and this is no exception.Feeble compared to the considerably superior Seven Samurai (1954) it tells the story of a lone samurai who arrives in a small town tormented by two gangs. In a bid to save the town he plays mind games with them both in an effort to get them to kill one another off.The plot is simple but well handled, the film looks the part and it's character development is great. As if that wasn't enough we have legendary director Akira Kurosawa behind the camera and Toshirô Mifune in front of it. Mifune is great and is on form here, but is it just me or does he always play essentially the same character?I wasn't that keen on the films finale, I also felt that it dragged in places but regardless is a watchable Toho effort and a must watch for fans of the genre.Enjoyable but top 250? Hardly.The Good:Some great comedyLooks very crisp for its ageToshirô Mifune is on formThe Bad:Drags in the middleFinale could have been handled betterThings I Learnt From This Movie:The Great Khali was a Japanese actor in the 1960'sToho movies give me sake cravings"
FilmOtaku,"Jul 7, 2005",5/10,"""Yojimbo"", Japanese for ""bodyguard"" is the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake, (Mifune) a samurai without a master or anyone to protect who walks into a small Japanese village that is rife with violence caused by two feuding groups. The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it.""Yojimbo"" was later remade into ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective ""heroes"". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Rashomon"" or ""High and Low"". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that ""Yojimbo"" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception. Because the film was decent, but not great, I'm giving it a decent, but not great rating  an average 5/10.--Shelly"
Infofreak,"May 15, 2004",N/A,"I'm not going to waste time debating which was the ""greatest"" or ""best"" of Kurosawa's movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it's 'Yojimbo'. 'Rashomon' and 'Throne Of Blood' are probably deeper and more substantial, but for sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat! Being a Kurosawa movie it's no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. The two made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watch the most. I love looking at Mifune's face! His expressions are awesome. He was without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars. 'Yojimbo' was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically 'A Fistful Of Dollars', but before you bay for Sergio Leone's blood, please read Dashiell Hammett's detective classic 'Red Harvest', published in 1929 and you'll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it.  I see no mention whatsoever of this source material in the credits for 'Yojimbo', so let's just leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincingly argued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westerns anyway. Walter Hill later ""remade"" 'Yojimbo' (or 'Red Harvest' depending on your perspective) as 'Last Man Standing' and David Lynch gave a small nod to it in his 'Wild At Heart'.  You can certainly see both the samurai and spaghetti influences in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 1 and 2, that's for sure. ""Influences"", ""inspirations"", these are things that go around and around, it's what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. 'Yojimbo' is a classic action movie. Maybe only 'Wages Of Fear' is better. Every film buff needs this movie in their collection!"
Witchfinder-General-666,"Jun 6, 2006",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa is widely (and rightly) thought of as one of the most important filmmakers in the history of motion pictures. ""Yojimbo"", one of the masterpieces that have earned him this more than deserved reputation, is not only one of the best, but also one of the most influential movies ever made. Only three years after its release another great director, Sergio Leone, who named Yojimbo one of his favorite movies, used it as the model for another masterpiece, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and rose the Italian Western to an international level.In 1860, a time when the sword is still the most common weapon in the Japanese province, but gradually gets replaced by the revolver, a lonely Ronin, a Samurai without a master to serve,(Toshiro Mifune) who dashes around the county, comes to a little town terrorized by two bosses and their criminal gangs and decides to end the people's suffering and free the town. He is hired by one of the gangs as a bodyguard, only to switch sides and pit the two, already hostile, gangs against each other.Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest character actors of all time, is impressive in his role of the Samurai, generally the acting is great in this movie, the supporting cast contains such actors as the great and unforgettable Takashi Shimura. The cinematography is great and the movie's brilliant score, composed by Fumio Hayasaka, is one of its kind. The writing and directing by the inimitable Akira Kurosawa is more than brilliant. One of the greatest movies by one of the greatest directors of all-time, and an absolute must-see for everyone interested in cinema!"
PureCinema,"Dec 26, 1998",10/10,"Kurosawa's influence in film is most easily recognized in the western. The Seven Samurai was remade in America as The Magnificent Seven, and our next film, Yojimbo was remade almost scene by scene as A Fistful of Dollars.The story takes place in 18th century Japan, a time when Samurai wandered the lands. A lone samurai, Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) drifts into a small town. Soon he discovers that the town is divided into two groups who are constantly fighting with one another. Sanjuro sees this as an easy opportunity to make money by lending his services to both sides, but soon he becomes too much involved and is tossed into prison. After escaping, he sees that the two sides are locked in a fierce battle and decides to end their feud once and for all.Yojimbo was an instant hit across Japan as well as internationally. Kurosawa also directed the sequel, ""Sanjuro"" a year later"
freemantle_uk,"Jun 30, 2013",9/10,"Yojimbo is one of Akira Kurosawa's most celebrated films in his career and was remade by Sergio Leone into A Fistful of Dollars. It is considered an essential film and a classic in the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune was excellent as the nameless ronin who sets out to protect the town, being a man of few words. Kurosawa is of course excellent at setting up the conflict in the town and how it affects the people whilst also delivering on fine samurai sword fights (a man even has his hand cut off). Kurosawa wonderfully lets his scenes play out with plenty of long shots and small camera movements. Kurosawa and his actors also inject some occasional moments of humours to help lighten the mood when need be. But for the most Yojimbo is a serious drama with some very dark elements. Out of the Kurosawa films I have seen I personally prefer Seven Samurai for its scale and Rashomon for its ambition, but Yojimbo is still a worthy film and true film buffs need to watch it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 16, 2012",10/10,"Akira Kurasawa is one of my favourite directors as of now. And Yojimbo does nothing to make me change that, if anything like Seven Samurai, Ran, Ikiru, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon and Throne of Blood it is another of his masterpieces. Like Hidden Fortress was a major influence on Star Wars, Yojimbo did the same for Fistful of Dollars. I've seen them compared a lot, but all I will say that for me both are milestones of their respective genres and both are movies to watch if not done so already. Back to Yojimbo, as always for a Kurasawa film, it is superbly made and made absolutely beautifully with epic scenery and great, stylish use of camera techniques. The music adds much to the story, and is remarkably atmospheric, the script is a fine mix of comedy, intrigue and sudden and quite unrelenting violence and the story is compelling and always entertaining, managing to both celebrate and subvert(but in a subtle way) the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune I have yet to see a bad performance from, and again he is a superb lead, who could be seen as an anti-hero as he sells his skills yet dupes both sides of the feudal community into slaughter. Overall, another fantastic film from perhaps the King of Japanese cinema. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
ma-cortes,"Aug 9, 2018",7/10,"Set in Japan , 1860 , at a little town that is a den of wrongs . Sanjuro, a wandering samurai enters a rural town in nineteenth century Japan and he finds himself the location run by two parties commanded by Ushitora and Seibe and their hired thugs . The samurái sells his activities to both parts with devasting resulting for all ; as he then sets out to rid the town of all these ominous people .The noisy town is full of injustices , inequity , violence and killings , due to the hordes of gamblers and murderers that inhabit it. After learning from the innkeeper that the town is divided between two mobsters , he plays one side off against the other . As 2 clans vying for political power bid on the services of a silent masterless Samurai , a quiet Ronin . His efforts are complicated by the arrival of the wily Unosuke who often uses a bloody gun . There is a massacre , but the samurai runs away with the help of the innkeeper ; but while recuperating at a nearby temple, he learns of an abduction carried out by Unosuke, and goes back to the town to take on enemies .This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being his international breakthrough one . Yokimbo , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The known film Leone¨For a fistful of dollars¨is mainly cribbed from this Japanese samurái action classic ; however , some reviewers tell this Yojinbo bears little resemblance to Sergio Leone film . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a Samurái who attempts to play the two warlords off against each other . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune . At the beginning , Sanjuro seems to be a good Samurai , as being beaten after he reunites an abducted woman with her husband and son, then massacres his father's opponents. As well as Tatsuya Nakadai , still acting , as Unosuke, the son of one of the gangsters, who owns a revolver.This fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy ."
raoul-guariguata,"Sep 21, 2006",10/10,"Well, I'm a great Toshiro Mifune fan and for that, this is one of the movies you have to watch. This Kurosawa story was remade by Sergio Leone as a Fistful of Dollars and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing. It was one of the first action flicks ever made; and for the first time presented the nameless action hero, who comes to town to set it free. He is always cool, always confident and a master of his skills, loves drinks and takes outs his enemies in a second. The acting of Mifune is superb and his figure inspired Clint Eastwood to stick a cigarette in his jaw just for the coolness factor in the old western movies (Mifune chewed on straw). I don't think Western action cinema and the representation of the main ""hero"" would have developed in the fashion they did, if Mifune never would have worked together with Kurosawa. Their influence is definitely large."
jldmp1,"Aug 30, 2006",10/10,"What Kurosawa did in a short space of years is nothing short of revolutionary. American cinema (post WWII to Vietnam)was largely confined to self-affirming stereotypes -- especially in Westerns dominated by the Ford/Wayne cartoon good guy paradigm.He turned all of that upside down (aided and abetted by Leone). His samurai existed more as a tragic Greek figure -- afflicted by a fatal flaw -- rather than the guy who simply wears the 'white hat'. This is combined with Mifune's remarkable skill at creating the character and making the character (not the actor) live in the cinematic space.The key to this movie is the unprecedented visual composition. Images assemble into the frame, stacked two and three layers deep with no vanishing point. All of the elements are in the same focus, resembling a Japanese watercolor painting. Then Kurosawa cuts to a right angle shot (to the imaginary 'left' of the framing shot), twisting our perception around of just how deep the placement is. He also composes scenes that openly reference that this is 'being watched' - note the characters peering through windows at a second layer (usually mimed action) in the background, again all in the same focus. The effects here are striking, to say the least.Try to imagine Clint's man with no name characters, or 'Star Wars'(hacked off arm, a la Obi-Wan), or the 'Kill Bill' volumes (the one against many swordfights and beating inflicted on the bride) -- these are some off the top of the head examples, and there are countless more -- without the influence of this movie. It's impossible. By the mid-60's, Clint's amoral, stoic gunfighter had displaced his forerunners, changing the equation forever.Essential viewing."
winner55,"Jun 25, 2006",10/10,"In the middle '20's, Dashiell Hammett (best known as author of ""The Maltese Falcon"") wrote two unrelated novels, ""The Glass Key"", about Ned Beaumont an alcoholic gambler who uses duplicity to save his mob boss from taking a murder rap for a corrupt politician (all the while fending off a rival mobster), and 'Red Harvest"", in which a nameless private eye (also alcoholic, a status shared by many Hammett heroes) is hired to clean up a small town kept in fear by two warring boot-leg mobs.I believe ""Red Harvest"" did make it to film in the '30's, but I haven't been able to track that down and never saw it. ""The Glass Key"" was first made into a (not too successful) film in 1935, and then re-made in 1942. The remake concerns us here. Directed by Stuart Heisler in a style that compounds the typical crime film briskness of the '30's with the shaded undertones of the then developing 'noir' genre, it is actually quite a good film, and in a number of ways daring for its period. True to the novel, literally everyone in the film is corrupt in some way, and especially fascinating is the appearance of William Bendix in a minor role of an overtly homosexual sadist of a thug. Alan Ladd plays Ned Beaumont as a true anti-hero, cold, calculating, true to no ethic but his own - a type Hollywood at that time was having problems presenting, since the strong ethics of the character undercut all the assumptions of sociopathy of such types popular at the time. The film finally betrays itself with a ""kiss-and-make-up"" final scene that completely undercuts the ethical problematic of the novel (in which Beaumont finally betrays his boss by running off with the boss' fiancée). But until then, the movie moves towards its dark ""who-dun-it"" revelation rapidly and filled with tension.There is a scene dead center in ""The Glass Key"" where Beaumont is captured by the rival mob boss and tortured by the sadistic thug (which is from the novel), and filled with Freudian undertones due to the homosexuality of the torturing thug (Bendix) (also implicit in the novel). I think it was Japanese cinema expert Donald Ritchie from whom I remember an anecdote that it was this scene that fascinated Akira Kurosawa to such an extent that he felt compelled to make a film based on a Hammett novel. Interestingly, he did not do a remake of ""The Glass Key"", however. Instead, he transposed ""Red Harvest"" to the Japan of the civil wars of the 1860's, rewriting the nameless private eye as an equally nameless wandering samurai (played with exquisite panache by Toshiro Mifuni), while at the same time parodying the typical *chambara* (swordfight film) popular in Japan. I refer of course to ""Yojombo"" (1962). Nonetheless, the the torture sequence is lifted from ""The Glass Key"" and interjected as a pivotal scene in ""Yojimbo"". A couple of subtractions and additions need be noted here: Kurosawa strips the Freudian subtext out of the torture sequence completely, so that the torture becomes a study in the what Hannah Arendt referred to as the ""banality"" of evil"" - the torturers are just doing a job. This fits neatly with the critique of capitalism implicit in the film, and which is equally implicit in the Hammett original, so the loss of Freudian content goes by unnoticed.On the other hand, Kurosawa and Mifune add an earthiness to the nameless hero lacking in Hammett's tension filled original: Mifune's samurai is always scratching, eating, cringing or sneering. Perhaps this is to make up for the subtraction of the element of alcoholism that was the chief weakness of Hammett's anti-hero. But it also has the effect of rounding out the character so that he becomes human to us in a way Hammett's anti-hero is not."

""Cooper... two coffins *stops, looks back* maybe three"") also i love Ushi-Toras brother, Ino, i think his name was ""Hey I know you! you're really strong!"" and at the sake shop with Seibeis wife when they're fighting over the samurai.well anyway... im starting to ramble now. but any one who hasn't seen this movie see it as soon as possible!"

In some parts, it is very difficult to follow the story, since I can not understand Japanese. Further, there is a bug and the DVD freezes at 75:51 min. I tried two DVDs and both presented the same problem. The solution is to go back to the 'Menu', select the next chapter and 'rewind' back to 75:52 min.

The_Void,"Sep 24, 2004",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa's tribute to the western is a marvelous piece of cinema. Toshirô Mifune stars as a ronin (samurai without a master) that goes to a small town, which is divided by two gangs of criminals. While there, he decides to play one off against the other in order to defeat both gangs. Yojimbo lacks the depth of some of Kurosawa's other films, such as Rashomon or Seven Samurai, but it is, on the whole, more entertaining and much more accessible than those two mentioned films, and most of the rest of Kurosawa's oeuvre. That's not to say that Yojimbo lacks substance however; there's more than enough here to please fans of Kurosawa's other works. Just like the majority of Kurosawa's films, Yojimbo is spectacularly well filmed. The black and white cinematography looks absolutely incredible, and the some of the scenes, in particular that involve rain, are extremely atmospheric and lend the movie a great gloomy style.Toshirô Mifune's performance in this film is, in my opinion, his best. Mifune has been in some great films and given some great performances, many of them under the direction of Kurosawa; but the one here eclipses them all in my opinion. In this film, Mifune is most definitely the 'star'. In many other Kurosawa films, Seven Samurai especially, Mifune hasn't been alone, and although he isn't alone here either; he has to carry the film a lot more than he has had to with other films, and he does a great job of it. The answer to the question of whether or not he is believable in his role isn't even debatable; he is. So believable in fact that it's hard to believe that he's an actor playing a samurai, and not an actual samurai. Like a western, Yojimbo features several weird characters that add to the feel of the movie. The actors playing these smaller roles aren't as pronounced, or indeed as great as Toshirô Mifune; but they all still excel in their small roles, making the support cast a very nice ensemble indeed.Yojimbo's influence can be felt across cinema. I dread to think how great cinema might not have been if the Japanese master; Akira Kurosawa had never picked up a camera. His body of work has influenced so many styles and genres that the mind literally boggles. If he never had made a film...well, it doesn't even bear thinking about. It is well known that for one, Yojimbo was remade into Sergio Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars', which in turn kick started Leone's career. That's just one great director we may have been without had it not been for Kurosawa. That's not all Yojimbo has had an impact on; the Spaghetti western sub-genre is littered with influence from this film, and even recent favourites such as Kill Bill have obviously taken influence from this masterpiece. Of course, cinema would be no worse off if Kill Bill was never made; but it's still credit to Yojimbo. Overall, every film fan should see Yojimbo. It's too important a film to miss, and not only that but it's guaranteed to give you 105 minutes of enjoyment. Highest recommendations from me."
Tashtago,"Mar 25, 2010",6/10,"I've seen a few Kurosawa's and by far the Seven Samurai is his best. In fact it's hard to believe Yojimbo was directed by the same guy. There's nothing in Jimbo like the stylistic battle scenes in Samurai. And the character development is far more limited. The fight scenes look static and the acting is real real over the top like live Shakespeare. Mifune does okay , but scratches his beard once too often.No make that twenty times too often. For me Kurosawa's two best are The Idiot and Samurai with portions of Ikiru,especially the scene with the stripper. This one is over rated . Oh and by the way iancowie I like Kind of Blue and listen to it every May 5th."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Sep 28, 2018",2/10,"My Rating : 2/10If you want a good Kurosawa film watch 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashômon' or 'High and Low'.Yôjinbô alongwith Ran are two of the least favourite of Akira Kurosawa movies for me. Some may undoubtedly like them.This is an easy pass for viewers like me and according to me this movie should be out of the imdb Top 250 as it's pretty terrible in all the ways, bad script, dialogue and most of all the directing and pacing.Don't waste your time here. 2/10."
Razzbar,"Mar 3, 2000",10/10,"If you like Mifune as a samurai, this is the one not to miss. Unlike Seven Samurai, where he's not really a samurai, in this one he is a fully-qualified, if masterless samurai. This is more of a ""pure samurai action"" movie than Seven*. The story is simpler and moves along faster, and Mifune doesn't have to share the spotlight with others so much. It's his movie, and is he ever ""bad""!There's a scene in the movie that puzzles me, I had to watch it several times, and still don't get it: It's where some government officials visit the village our hero's ""saving"", and soon find themselves passed out on some spiked sake... the man who's serving them goes up to each of the two passed-out officials, and replaces their little bottles from behind, and then gives their sleeve a snap as if to straighten out the fabric, and gives a little snappy salute or something I can't figure it out, maybe you can.If you like samurai movies, you just gotta see this one, no getting out of it. Dig the theme music for Mifune's character played on a baritone sax.. he's baaaaaad!"
Portablechad,"Jul 31, 2011",10/10,"I recently watched Kurosawa's Yojimbo and now I'm looking at how to watch the rest of his films.Yojimbo really changed the way I look at action movies. The whole theme of ""don't look away"" was good for the action, in my opinion. I feel as if the jerking, oblique and changing camera usage found in most modern action films, takes away from the action, not improving on it. There would be a single-camera throughout a whole fight scene which added to the realness of the action. I also have to say, for the fighting, the western-samurai combination was well used.The cinematography was great; Kurosawa really uses the camera to his advantage. As discussed, cinematography for the fight scenes was great a 'less-is-more' situation for me. I loved the camera angle - for when the two houses slowly approach each other, unwilling to fight - as the Samurai watches like a god from above. The camera was often far away from the subject, which gave me a feeling as if I was more in the film than any other film I've seen before.The Western feel throughout the samurai film was portrayed through its art direction. The art director did an extremely good job with the city and roads, the single-street town with the occasional tumble-weed gave off the old standoff feel. Other western elements would be with the two sides fighting against each other, and the lone-ranger only looking out for himself, and oddly the good of the people.The film has a good story line. Although, the film has a fairly predictable main story with side points that cause some confusion yet a good amount of mystery and a closer look into the main character's morals. The main character is similar to any good action movie character, quiet, strong, and with a sense of justice for the common people.Kurosawa's one of my new favorite directors; directing, Yojimbo, Seven Samurai, Ikiru, Kagemusha, and Ran. I can't wait to watch them all. I greatly recommend Yojimbo for anyone who is looking for a good action movie and doesn't have too many graphics or gives you a headache from oblique camera shots during fight scenes. Yojimbo was a great film that isn't outdated from its black and white exterior, but greatly appreciated over time for its amazing directing and a great one-of a kind, film."
OllieSuave-007,"Oct 25, 2013",9/10,"This is an excellent and exciting samurai movie starring Toshiro Mifune as a clever ronin, who tries to save a town from two rivaling gangs by playing them against each other.Mifuni gave a solid performance as the sword-wielding samurai, providing much action and humor in a film full of drama and twists. Each and every actor gave a very memorable performance, creating an eerie atmosphere that makes the movie unpredictable, but memorizing at the same time. It is fun to watch Mifuni's methods of operation as he deals with the two gangs, thinking what kind of cards to play to get them to defeat each other.I haven't seen much of director Akira Kurosawa's work, but he surely did a great job in directing this film. It is not too long, not too short, but just right, filmed in a pace that will keep the audience engaged. Masaru Sato's haunting music score was perfect for this movie.This surely is one of my favorite action movies; all action movie lovers will be, I believe, thoroughly entertained by this feature.Grade A"
SnoopyStyle,"Feb 27, 2014",8/10,"Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) is a wandering ronin who arrives in a town ruined by two warring gangs of thugs. When the old warlord died, he left it all to his weakling son. The next in command objects and forms his own gang. Sanjuro makes money by pitting the two sides against each other. Then Unosuke returns to town with a revolver. Sanjuro rescues beautiful Nui for her pathetic husband and son.Many have drawn inspiration from this Akira Kurosawa movie. More importantly, they have drawn inspiration from this character. He is the iconic anti-hero and an inspiration for the man with no name. The movie starts with a son who runs away to be a hired thug. He rather live it up and die young than to live a long bland farmer's life. Then when Sanjuro first gets to town, he sees a dog walk off with a severed hand setting the tone for the movie. So much of this movie is memorable. When the gangs face off, they hilariously can't quite get the fight started. This character isn't the classic white hat good guy. He's in it for the money. Even the victims are pathetic to him, but he still has enough morality to rescue the innocent."
gbill-74877,"Apr 8, 2020",8/10,"Toshiro Mifune is cool and perfectly understated here - his character is a samurai who can dispatch a circle of guys around him in about ten seconds and everyone knows it, but he doesn't flaunt it, and is the ultimate tough guy. As many have commented, the debt that Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood owe to Kurosawa and Mifune can't be overstated, and at the time, I don't believe that was adequately understood despite the plagiarism lawsuit that resulted.If I'm honest, though I loved this film I thought its first half was too slow, in particular after it became apparent that Mifune's character was going to watch the townsfolk and rival gang members through a window and drive up a bidding war for his services. It builds to a glorious second half though, with some nice turns to a plot which was seeming to be all too linear, and iconic imagery. Seeing Mifune standing out on that street in the distance, the dust swirling around him, as a row of guys start advancing toward him, is an indelible image.Most of all, I love the complexity in Mifune's character, which seems other-worldly. He's the man with no name, a wandering samurai at a time when Japan was modernizing and they would soon be gone. He seems to have no sense of morality or honor, and yet we don't know what he would have done had he not overheard the clan he first pledged himself to talking about betraying him, and later he's an angel of mercy to a family, at the risk of his own peril. He's a man of the world, often seeming to care most about getting his next meal and some sake, and yet he also seems to have been destined by a higher power to come to the town to cleanse it of evil elements, of which there are many. The scene where he's in the cemetery and looks beat up and absolutely ghoulish amplifies this feeling for me. It's a remarkable character and performance.My only regrets for the film are its pace in the first half, as I mentioned, and in how cartoonish the gang members are. We see a lot of cowardice, calling for ""mommy,"" and idiotic behavior. Maybe the buffoonish character with the unibrow and moronic expression exemplifies this most, and I would have preferred it if it had skipped the comedy. There is certainly a comment on humanity or the modern, dishonorable world here, which instead of being happy to live in peace are endlessly fighting over material possessions, but it undercuts some of the menace facing the ronin. I loved how one of the characters (Tatsuya Nakadai) comes to town with a gun, truly upping the arms race and representing the new world, and he's very effective. There's another who is very tall and wields a huge mallet, played by 6'7"" wrestler (Namigoro Rashomon), and I wish that weapon had been used in battle.As it is, though, that final showdown is brilliant. The moment with the gun towards the end is as well, as the ronin's action defies the expectations of the audience, and could be interpreted as supreme courage, world-weary indifference, or prescience. Maybe the film is saying there are very few truly kind or brave people in the world, and they are destined (or perhaps blessed) to remain somehow apart from it."
mcallen,"Oct 5, 2000",N/A,"Attending a Kurosawa film festival in Los Angeles in the early seventies, I first saw ""Yojimbo"".  I was about 20 years old.  Walking out of the theater, my posture and strut affected by Toshiro Mifune's, my mind awhirl at the artistry, humor, humanity and subtlety of the film maker, I could not wait to see more.  Yojimbo is a great film. Stark, funny, dangerous and imbued with Kurosawa's signature compassion and justice.The opening scene, where Mifune, as the wandering samurai, establishes his character with small gestures, and chooses his path with the toss of a stick, offers a promise that is kept.  We are embarking on an adventure of unknown import and outcome, with nothing fore ordained, but in the company of strength and readiness.There are few matches in the history of cinema to equal the director Kurosawa and the actor Mifune.  They are missed.No one in cinema has bettered Kurosawa in the choreography of action, and so much of what we've seen since is in his debt, but honors him poorly.You would do well to study Kurosawa's work.  While it some times goes too far into the sentimental for my tastes, the whole of it is beyond compare."
FiftyTwo_52,"Sep 9, 2025",6/10,"Yojimbo stands as historically significant cinema that's more important than entertaining by today's standards.Kurosawa's technical mastery remains undeniable... his camera work and composition influenced generations of filmmakers. The DNA of every ""lone gunslinger"" from Leone's westerns to modern action heroes traces back to Mifune's swagger here.But watching in 2025 reveals the film's age, so it is a 6/10 today. The pacing feels glacial compared to contemporary thrillers. Characters serve archetypal functions rather than feeling like real people... the women especially are props in a masculine power fantasy. Mifune's performance, while iconic, relies heavily on physical presence over emotional depth.The plot's simplicity worked in 1961 but feels thin stretched over two hours. Yes, it's the template Leone perfected, but the student surpassed the teacher. Where Leone added operatic intensity and Morricone's transcendent scores, Kurosawa delivers workmanlike craftsmanship.This is museum-piece cinema: technically accomplished, historically crucial, but emotionally distant. Film students should study it; general audiences will struggle to stay engaged. The influence is undeniable, the execution competent, but the magic that made Kurosawa's earlier works timeless feels absent here.Respect the legacy, acknowledge the craftsmanship, but don't expect to be transported."
nintendovi,"Mar 26, 2008",9/10,"Yojimbo manages to do something that far too many films fail to take into consideration - it keeps things simple. The characters all have fun and larger-than-life personalities, the plot is straightforward, and it's even got the right amount of seriousness to it to maintain a sense of realism. The acting was all good and believable, and the protagonist's eccentric personality often kept me guessing what he had planned next.There isn't a lot I have to complain about with Yojimbo. I could probably criticize the movie's usage of stereotypical Japanese personalities, but this is a samurai movie after all, so if anything it helps to form the basis for traditional Japanese culture and ideals. Probably my biggest complaint would be, that there isn't much action in the movie - and that's really the only thing stopping me from giving the movie a '10'. Of course, you have to take into consideration that this isn't a movie about groups of samurai warriors fighting each other, it's a movie about a witty wondering samurai who meets someone nearly as cunning and witty as he.For anyone that's a fan of samurai films, Japanese culture, proverbs and fables...or even classic American films set in the wild west - then this movie will not disappoint."
billsoccer,"Aug 24, 2022",6/10,"While I admit this would have been great for its time (3 years before A Fistful of dollars ripped its plot off!), it can hardly be considered a great film now. The (over-) acting is terrible - facial grimaces and other stylized stomping to and fro, though I did enjoy the lead actors actions, and humor. Hope Clint Eastwood is appropriately grateful to the writer, who launched him to stardom./"
dwpollar,"Nov 14, 2009",3/10,"1st watched 11/14/2009 - 3 out of 10 (Dir- Akira Kurosawa): Confusing feudal piece about an old samurai warrior coming into a town and causing confusion between the parties leading to greater destruction because of it. Toshiro Mifune plays the samurai who kind of plays with both parties and tricks them into hating each other even more by his manipulative ways. Initially, it's a little comedic how he plays with them but them he gets beaten up and the innocent get thrown into the mix and the humor leaves. This movie is really hard to follow because it's hard to identify each party as unique. One group are gamblers and the others are protectors of a brothel. The town obviously has no real presence of authority but the drifter doesn't bring any of that into play by being there. I'm assuming that this is because the wars are over and there is no one in power. I'm sure it would help to understand a little of the Japanese history to understand this movie -- unfortunately I have none. The movie really becomes pretty brutal and those left standing are just lucky -- I guess. Mifune's portrayal is a little confusing as well as he kind of snickers at both sides until he's beaten up and then he takes things into his own hands. A much heralded Japanese director in Akira Kurasawa made this film but I'm sorry I just didn't get the appeal of this movie."
stamper,"Feb 22, 2004",8/10,"Yojimbo, which was remade' three years later and only slightly different as Per un pugno di dollari (which I will refer to as A Fistful of Dollars from here on), is a really impressive piece of film-making. Made back in 1961, it is obvious the Japanese not only had quality actors, but also at least one good director. The story itself had not much surprises for me, since I've seen A Fistful of Dollars about five times and since that film is almost an exact copy of Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo. Still I enjoyed watching Yojimbo, because it combined good acting, an amazingly modern score for its time and good directing.Toshirô Mifune (most famous perhaps for his leading role in the mini series Shogun) plays the main character in Yojimbo, who is just as cool and has just as many one-liners as Eastwood in the remake'. The only difference between Eastwood and Mifune would be that the latter one does not smoke. Even some of the gestures that Eastwood's character had in A fistful of Dollars are similar to the ones Mifune had in this film. It is almost surreal how much these films have in common. The films are equally well made and equally good as far as I am concerned, except maybe that there was no qualitative equivalent to Gian Maria Volonté in this film. The only real difference I could find between the two films, was that Yojimbo is a bit more brutal' than A Fistful of Dollars (watch what the dog has between his teeth in both films). All in all, this is a pretty good film and certainly one that has earned his place in cinema history. I for one will go and try to consume more of Kurosawa's films and maybe you should go and see if you can dig up Yojimbo or another one of his films as well.7,5 out of 10"
rdoyle29,"Nov 23, 2013",9/10,"It's no surprise that this has been adapted as both a western and a gangster movie since it blends elements of both genres along with the samurai genre. The setting is typically western with the town consisting of businesses lining a central road and much of the plot follows a western blueprint, leading up to a final showdown in the center of town. It's not just the plot that is transferred over to ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but much of the look and visual style of the film is also adopted. The characters seem to come from somewhere else though. The film is a loose adaptation of Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"", and that novel's gangster characters seem to have been dropped into the western/samurai setting. The cross-genre blending is brilliant, allowing for new heights of cynicism and black comedy in the samurai, and ultimately the western, genre."
lastliberal-853-253708,"Dec 17, 2013",9/10,"The first ""man with no name"" was Toshirô Mifune, who made 16 films with writer/director Akira Kurosawa, starting with Drunken Angel in 1948, and ending with Red beard in 1965. This is one of his greatest performances.Anyone familiar with American or Italian spaghetti westerns will instantly see the story here. The loner walks into town and sees an opportunity to play both sets of bad guys against each other to make money from each.It is funny, and has lots of action as any western does. Forget any idea of foreign films when watching Mifune and Kurosawa. They are as familiar to you as films you grew up with. For great entertainment, they cannot be beat."
Snow Leopard,"Mar 25, 2005",N/A,"With Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune both in top form, ""Yojimbo"" is one of their most enjoyable and interesting movies. The story and the characters are both fun to watch, and there is a lot of action, which also is by no means without some substance.The intriguing setup gets things off to a great start. As Mifune's character learns what is going on in the town, you can almost see his mind at work, calculating how to play off one gang against the other. The story itself offers lots of good turns with plenty of good action sequences, and the ideas behind the story are interesting as well. Mifune's character is not just a master swordsman, but also a clever psychologist, and the various plot turns provide an interesting, cynical, and amusing look at human nature.All of that takes place against some nicely-crafted settings and scenery that have a lot of interesting detail, plus a musical score that complements the action quite well. In fact, everything about the movie is fun to watch. It all seems so effortless, and yet it is really the result of some master craftsmen at work."

His athleticism and physical presence are pure bonus, because this guy can really act too.  He plays a great anti-hero role in this film.

MaxBorg89,"Apr 18, 2006",10/10,"I watched this film mainly because I had read it inspired one of my favorite Westerns, A Fistful of Dollars. I can say it was a pleasant experience, as Yojimbo is a remarkable movie, brilliantly directed by Akira Kurosawa.Instead of the Man With No Name, played by Clint Eastwood in the Dollar trilogy, we get Kurosawa-regular Toshiro Mifune as a nameless ronin (masterless warrior) who ends up in a village torn apart by the war between two rivaling gangs (the setting is medieval Japan, as in other movies by ""the Emperor"") . Tired of all the suffering he witnesses, our protagonist decides to take down both criminal groups. How? By having them destroy each other, one by one.Kurosawa brings another fundamental contribution to a genre and world he knows well with this compelling tale about greed, justice and loyalty. Even if you already know the ending, the film will keep you captivated until Mifune has delivered his last philosophical one-liner. He is very intriguing as the unidentified man who slowly but firmly restores order and peace (Eastwood would later do so too, but not with the same elegance, neither physical nor verbal).Yojimbo truly is a masterwork of Asian cinema, a powerful achievement which spawned dozens of copycats and influenced an entire career, having the same effect on Sergio Leone as Hitchcock had on Brian De Palma. Definitely worth a look if you want to see who did these things first and best.I do wonder what the Man With No Name's catchphrases would have sounded like in Japanese, though..."
trianglesamurai,"Feb 11, 2004",10/10,"They don't make people like Akira Kurosawa in America. Nor do they make actors like Toshiro Mifune. Watch this movie and then watch ""The Seven Samurai"" (""Shichinin No Samurai""). They're both in black and white, and not as fast paced as today's 2fast 2forgettable garbage, but they're both far more entertaining, immersive and intense. Every moment has its purpose, every action a reaction. This is the lost art of film. Also, go watch all of Kurosawa's other movies, particularly ""Rashomon"", ""The Hidden Fortress"", and ""Ran"". Take a look at his movie listing and observe all the movies that were made with his scripts in other countries. Make sure you vote for ""The Seven Samurai"" after you watch it, those -lame by comparison- Lord of the Rings movies have been pushing it back from it's rightful place in the top 250 movies."
willcundallreview,"Jul 18, 2015",5/10,"Rating-5/10Yojimbo, A samurai action movie created by the legendary director and writer Akira Kurosawa. This movie is considered the stuff of movie legend, but for me, it is far from it. It's not that it's a bad movie, not even that poor, I just didn't feel it is special and wound up for me an average movie. So why do people love this so much?, well to be perfectly honest I have no idea, it is smart no doubt but just too dull to be fully enjoyed, the kind of movie only some can fully appreciate.Now don't get me wrong, the movie is pretty much built up of well done things, but just not well enough. Toshiro Mifune is very good as the samurai who makes up his name, he seems to act at a much higher level than everyone else in this cast, top stuff. As the acting goes though, it is not good and even though Mifune is on form, the rest of the cast drag the acting score so low I can't give it credit. The problem is it is just so over the top, it isn't believable and the characters seem like from a comedy at times.Kurosawa directs and co writes well enough for this, it isn't maybe what I expect from a movie held in such high regard, but nevertheless you can see his skill at times. The movie I felt is not paced all that well, it has a very slow beginning and very little action actually, the ending is the opposite with lots going on and more action than before, it needed for me to be more evenly spread.I think yet again the case with the cinematography and the editing is the same as the others before, done well not just not very well. I felt the editing could be a little sloppy, the cinematography makes sure that the technical side does it well with a nice approach and some pretty nice shots too. One thing I really disliked in the movie, maybe the most is the score, now some people who have seen it may read this part and disagree which is fine, but for me it is horrible, doesn't fit in the picture and makes ordinary scenes going slowly seem like there meant to be massive epic shots.I think sometimes it is easy to criticise an older movie because it doesn't have the same things we have today, but this movie does have some positives. The ending is at moments thrilling and as mentioned the action stepped up, the fighting is a little poorly choreographed but I feel it only looks that way because of the editing to make it look less violent. That said this movie is not all that gory and horrible, the odd death and arm cut off, but not in a disgusting way, the movie is more sensible than to horrify the viewer.I think by the end, you either could watch this with great praise or great displeasure, but even if you pick one way or the other, most should admit this is a smart plot. Of course Sergio Leone's ""Man With no Name"" series must be inspired by this, and that being a spaghetti western just goes to show how far this movie can reach and also inspire around the world. I do feel this is a kind of plot that works better like say in a western, a good story but points in it just not good enough for me, Kurosawa doesn't waste his time, he just doesn't make it enjoyable enough."
bill-422,"Sep 24, 1999",9/10,"This is one of the easiest Kurosawa masterpieces to watch, and like previous classics from this legendary director, the action of the story occurs in medevial Japan.  Ironically, this tale was inspired by the American Western (which is clearly evident)and inspired an important chapter of the Western genre. Later remade as Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (which led to ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West""), Akira Kurosawa's medevial ""western"" is just as enjoyable, violent and stylish as Clint Eastwood's ""spaghetti"" Western that most movie fans are familair with. It is rare that a film and its subsequent re-make can be equally enjoyable and of equal quality, but such is the case.  In Kurosawa's original, Toshiro Mifune portrays ""The Man With No Name"" and is just as mysterious, witty and sarcastic as that tough, skinny American.  Fans of Leone's Westerns would be very wise to witness this great film.  Comparisons are pretty futile since both are of different cultural settings and the action in both are exceedingly excellent.  But it is such a great story and a great film to watch, an admirer certainly won't mind to witness two great versions of the same terrific formula.""Yojimbo"" was again re-made in the 90's with Bruce Willis in ""Last Man Standing""."
byght,"Jun 28, 2004",9/10,"Nobody ever talks about Kurosawa's sense of humor, it seems.  But there are scenes in this ironic samurai romp that would do Mel Brooks proud--chief among them the brilliant sequence where the two factions TRY to fight each other in the streets but keep retreating from one another out of cowardice.""Yojimbo"" is, in fact, a pretty well-disguised satire that's not usually discussed as such.  Though not as cynical as Leone's remake, ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" ""Yojimbo"" is still a jaded reimagining of the samurai as an irreverant, self-interested mercenary.  The war between the silk and sake factions of the small town is in essence a pathetic comedy of errors, and Sanjuro's systematic annihilation of both sides, though probably largely deserved, is a sort of exaggerated, bloody prank.Of course, Kurosawa's patient, steady-as-a-rock direction helps to create an air of serious drama for the film, which serves to make the satire even more sophisticated.A special film to say the least--""Yojimbo"" is fun to watch on pretty much every level."
slowbro13215,"Nov 3, 2002",8/10,"Well, I've seen most of Kurosawa's major works now, and though I really like Yojimbo, I don't rank it among his best. In fact, I really enjoyed his movies that, yes, were NOT about samurai! Hakuchi (The Idiot) and Tengoku To Jigoku (High And Low) I thought were both better than this one, but I'm not putting down Yojimbo at all. It was a very nice watch in terms of both plot and style, and of course spectacular direction by Kurosawa and acting by Mifune. I also enjoyed the way this movie really seemed like a Western, as this movie was both influenced by past Westerns and influenced future Westerns. Very nice flow to the film. All in all, well worth you time. My rating: 7.5/10."
ks4,"May 21, 2004",8/10,"Yojimbo (The Bodyguard)Sanjuro is a ronin, a samurai without a master, walking around trying to find peace. He arrives to a town divided by two gangs, one produces Silk, the other produces Sake. The Town is divided between them, both are they fighting for the being the one gang in charge, the fight has lasted long and has killed almost all business in town, except the one making coffins for all the corpses the war produces. Sanjuro wants to help, offers to help both of them depending on who will pay him the highest fee. But his real intention is to play the gangs against each other to free the town from them.My long awaited first Kurosawa experience, and i do admit, there is no doubt he is a rare genius. This story is just so well told, perfectly balanced the movie never fails to be interesting, all the way through it kept me interested, wanting to see the progress. Pure perfection. It's one of those movies where i thought afterwards how perfectly paced it was, every second is there for a reason, there isn't a second to much, or a second to little, fantastic. Also the movie, despite being very old, is actually still today very watchable, although it hasn't aged as well as some other old movies i have seen. I can still see where many modern movies have gotten the inspiration from, the amount of scenario you can recognize here is absolutely admirable, and there has also been much talk about the storyline directly have inspired a great director like Sergio Leone, to make his western triumph ""A Fistful of Dollars"".Kurosawa is the genius in this movie, in a movie that is so well construction you can tell this movie was made by a creative genius, but also a man who constantly seeked for perfection, every thing in the movie seem to be thought so well through, every little sequence. One great piece in the movie directing wise is the stunning use of the a confusing touch to the movie, the windy, cold, dirty roads of the town, it's just so well portrayed.I haven't seen many old Japanese movies, but the acting here is brilliant, i love the passion that exists in the Japanese language. Toshiro Mifune is quite fantastic in the leading role, but i think all of the cast gives a very good performance, and there isn't a flaw to put on any of them. Especially the wife to Seibei i thought was fantastic in portraying the cold, evil and brutal women, that she played.To up it up. This movie is almost a perfect construction. Furthermore the movie has inspired decades of movies, truly admirable. I was very surprised to see how well such an old movie manages to keep my interest up nearly all the way through, it's really a well balanced movie that never manages to get boring at all. But even though i have a lot of praise for the movie, it didn't get all the way through me, i wasn't stunned afterwards, i didn't want to become a samurai and a Japanese, that is what makes me not giving it a top grade. But i still found it a very good movie that portrayed many sides of the human mind, greed, anger, fear, evil, but most important we also got to see how Sanjuro, the fearsome Samurai, also had a heart of gold with his intention of helping the innocent in people in the village.8/10"
TheNabOwnzz,"Apr 17, 2018",9/10,"Considering Kurosawa's incredible filmography, the fact that Yojimbo is generally considered as one of his best is an incredible compliment, and that opinion is very well justified. It is both an extremely entertaining battle of wits with great swordsplay sequences and fantastic dialogue and it also has some moral ambiguity.Ofcourse Toshiro Mifune steals the show once again in a Kurosawa film with his 'cool' charismatic attitude and his indifference to violence, yet also being an individual of some morals even though he seems to only care about gold at the start of the film. However, due to a certain selfless act in the later part of the movie where he saves a certain person it proves he is indeed an individual of some moral value. He is Sanjuro, which is an alias he gives, but nevertheless he is a ronin ( masterless samurai ) who wanders into a town divided by two rival gangs, so he decides to play them against eachother in order to make some gold in the progress since he seems to be penniless when he can't pay for his food at the restaurant.The movie combines Japan's three greatest actors together in one film with Toshiro, Tatsuya Nakadai & Takashi Shimura. After Nakadai's breakthrough in the first two parts of the incredible 'The Human Condition' trilogy in which he plays an idealistic good guy, he decided to play the villain in Yojimbo and in this shows his incredible range as an actor. Always keeping the evil fiendish smile on his face, his screen presence after Mifune has to be one of the strongest in cinematic history. Unfortunately Shimura ( Who had his greatest role in Ikiru (1952) ) has a relatively smart role, but still a crucial one to the plot.As usual Kurosawa uses his trademark tools movement and weather extremely well this film. It uses a lot of widescreen shots and excellent camera angles in which you never seem to miss a thing, they are always set up just right. Combined with the beautiful black and white cinematography there are some of cinema's greatest and most beautiful shots in this movie, especially during the epic final standoff which is one of the greatest scene's ever made. As stated before, Kurosawa also made use of weather once again to create the film's mood. It starts off bright and sunny, and as the violence escalates it starts raining, when finally in the climax there is a very hard wind blowing loads of epic looking dust on the screen. Kurosawa was a master of making loads of things happen in one single shot, and it is also the case here. A lot of shots have interesting things happen in the background, foreground and anywhere else in between.This movie created a couple of remakes such as A Fistful of Dollars (1964) by Sergio Leone which, while being a great film, still does not quite live up to the quality of Yojimbo and Last Man Standing (1996) by Walter Hill, which is a very poor film. It goes to show how influential this movie also is to western directors since Kurosawa is also known for combining Japanese and western elements into his films, and you can see a bit of John Ford-like camera work in Yojimbo.Everything summed up this means Yojimbo is an incredibly vibrant, clever, in many cases beautiful motion picture created by the master Kurosawa himself."
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 28, 2008",N/A,"Yojimbo (1961)**** (out of 4)Akira Kurosawa's film about a samurai (Toshiro Mifune) who goes to a small town that's been taken over by two opposing gangs and plays both sides against one another. Needless to say this film is miles ahead of countless remakes including A Fistful of Dollars and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing, which was actually the film that made me aware of this one. TBS use to run a promo about ""Movies For Guys Who Like Movies"" and this film here must be the movie for guys who like movies. A wonderful action film that has plenty of violence mixed in with laughs that makes it one of the all time greats. Mifune's comic timing is wonderful as is the music score that plays all the right notes. If I was to ever have to fight a dozen or so guys I'd want this score playing in the background."
sektoras,"Nov 13, 2025",7/10,"Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo is often praised as a classic of Japanese cinema and a key influence on later Westerns, but watching it today, it doesn't entirely live up to its reputation. While the film has a strong central concept - a lone, cunning samurai manipulating two rival gangs - its execution can feel slow and repetitive. Many scenes of villagers running around or reacting to the chaos seem to add little to the story, creating a sense of padding rather than tension.The pacing is uneven, and despite the film's short runtime, several sequences drag, making the middle section especially dull. The action scenes, though perhaps groundbreaking for 1961, appear fairly tame and unconvincing by modern standards, lacking the energy or precision found in later samurai films.That said, Yojimbo still has redeeming qualities. Toshiro Mifune gives a charismatic performance, and Kurosawa's eye for composition and framing remains impressive. The dusty, desolate town is visually striking, and the film's dark humor occasionally shines through.Overall, Yojimbo is historically important and stylish in moments, but it can be a tedious watch. The repetitive crowd scenes and underwhelming fights make it less engaging than its reputation suggests - a film easier to admire than to enjoy."
bix171,"May 5, 2014",9/10,"Akira Kurosawa's film about a wayward samurai (Toshiro Mifume), who restores balance to his world by pitting two rival gangs against each other, highlights one of his great strengths: his ability to allow all his performers to give the best performances they could give. Though ""Yojimbo"" ostensibly showcases the wonderful Mifume, there's plenty of room for other actors, notably Tatsuya Nakadai (as the only gunslinger in a 19th-century Japanese village), Atsushi Watanabe (as a coffin-maker) and the superb Eljiro Tono (as the saloon-keeper who serves as the film's center). The film itself is beautiful to look at (there are several great compositions) and has the feel of a new paradigm, with Mifume's very human antihero up against a realistically violent, unsavory world. Despite its setting, it has a remarkably modern feel, aided by a thoroughly modern, totally cool jazz score by Masaru Sato that pays reverence to its eastern antecedents."
JamesHitchcock,"Aug 3, 2023",7/10,"In 1860, a small Japanese town is being torn apart by a feud between two rival criminal gangs. Apart from a corrupt and cowardly town constable, there is no police force to maintain law and order; when a Government inspector arrives the two gangs have to be on their best behaviour to give a false impression of a peaceful community, but as soon as he leaves they are free to resume their violence.A ronin, or wandering samurai, arrives in town. The man gives his name as Kuwabatake Sanjuro (probably a pseudonym), but is also known as Yojimbo, meaning ""the Bodyguard"". Because of his skill with a sword, both Ushitora and Seibei, the leaders of the two warring gangs, try to persuade him to join them. He, however, has a sense of honour and realises that both men are equally worthless, and prefers to play both ends against the middle, in an effort to rid the town of the gangs and restore peace.If that sounds like the plot of a Western, there are good reasons. Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Western from 1964, ""A Fistful of Dollars"", was an unacknowledged remake of ""Yojimbo"", and Leone's film and its two sequels were an important influence on the subsequent development of the Western genre. The influence, however, has not been all one way. It has been claimed that Akira Kurosawa, who produced, directed and co-wrote ""Yojimbo"", was influenced by an American novel, Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"". He was certainly influenced by the traditional American Western. Although he uses a sword rather than a gun, the ronin was clearly based upon the wandering gunfighter, a figure who existed in the Western genre long before the ""Man with No Name"", Clint Eastwood's character in ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Think, for example, of the characters played by Gary Cooper in ""The Westerner"" and Alan Ladd in ""Shane"".Some of the other characters seem like attempts to find Japanese equivalents for stock western figures- the ruthless gang bosses, the cowardly, self-serving lawman, the tavern keeper, the gambler, the prostitutes, the country boy who leaves the family farm to join the gangs in a search for excitement, only to find when the going gets tough that he would rather be a live farmer than a dead gangster. There is a final showdown in an empty main street, with all the people cowering inside their houses, which reflects the traditional Western climactic gunfight. The late 19th century setting- many samurai films were set at an earlier period- may also have been chosen to allow one character to use a Western-style pistol, presumably imported from abroad.At the centre of the film is a fine performance from Toshiro Mifune as the ronin. Mifune may well have influenced Eastwood's portrayal of the Man with No Name- gruff, laconic, crude, scruffily dressed and with no social graces- but in one respect his ronin is closer to the characters played by Cooper and Ladd. Like them he has a sense of honour and decency, whereas Eastwood's character is more amoral, hard-bitten and mercenary. ""Yojimbo"" is a fine film in its own right, an exciting action-adventure with a compelling hero at its centre- but it is also interesting to watch for the way in which it illustrates a web of cross-cultural influences between East and West. 7/10."
emineric,"Jan 9, 2003",4/10,"honestly the main character reminded me more of a belushi than a masterless swordsman.  the action was short, fast, and not good.  the only redeeming quality was the main character was always calm and controlled even when confronted.  i will not be renting the sequel.  i give it 5 out of 10."
brogmiller,"Jan 26, 2025",10/10,"Just as Akira Kurosawa was influenced by the West, so the West has 'borrowed' from him and indeed it was 'Rashomon' that prompted the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to introduce the Foreign Film category in 1952. His films have always been more appreciated in Hollywoodland than in Japan which considered his films too 'westernised' as opposed to those of Ozu and Mizoguchi and it is bitterly ironic that his sole directorial assignment in Hollywood proved to be a deeply humiliating experience.How does one begin to describe the extraordinary 'Yojimbo'? Coming at the end of a particularly creative period for its director, it is inspired by the Japanese Jidai-geki and its sub-category Chambera but subverts those genres by virtue of its graphic violence, dark humour, parody, caricatured villains and the introduction of a cynical anti-hero in the person of wandering Samurai Sanjuro who offers his services to the highest bidder in 'a town full of people who deserve to die'.Kurosowa's love of the Western genre reveals itself in the plot and especially in the set-up of the wide street in a small town and effective use of the 'Scope image, a compliment repaid by Sergio Leone three years later. Kazuo Miyagawa is again behind the camera and Kurosawa's compositions are masterful whilst the far from subdued jazzy score by Masuro Sato although seemingly incongruous, actually works wonderfully.As well as depicting the absurd, self-destructive nature of humankind, Kurosawa and Ryuzo Kikushima have created in Sanjuro a fascinating, three-dimensional character given one of the screen's most iconic central performances by the magnificent Toshiro Mifune who was to reprise the role in the semi-sequel for the same director the following year. In fact the quality of their collaborations from 'Drunken Angel' in 1948 to 'Red Beard' in 1965 remains unequalled.One of Kurosawa's staunchest devotees was George Lucas so best to leave the final words to him: ""The art of moving pictures is in every frame of his films."""

The town is a den of inequity, not only due to the warlords and their hired thugs, but due to the hordes of gamblers that inhabit it. The samurai sets out to rid the town of all these pestilences, his plan being to play the two warlords off against each other.Excellent movie by famed Japanese director Akira Kurosawa. Clever, unpredictable plot with some great twists along the way. Good character development and some great action scenes.The only blemish is that it is difficult to figure out which characters fit into the mix in what way. This is often heightened by Kurosawa introducing an important character out of the blue, with no background. They're often linked to the story via another character, a character who we also don't know much about, if anything at all. So some of the character-specific stories were a bit hard to follow.An influential movie in that Sergio Leone used this as inspiration for his spaghetti westerns - a Fistful of Dollars in particular. You can see it in some of the fight scenes: the slow, deliberate build-up, the music the Mexican standoff. A Fistful of Dollars is even regarded as a remake of Yojimbo."
luisguillermoc3,"Mar 16, 2010",8/10,"Pass and years go by, and gives the impression that life scenarios follow-removable rotating one wheel. We learn, but do not exercise, much less self-critical to reflect on what shows daily existence. Technology advances, it becomes science, we have more and more glimpses of the vastness and power of the universe, but about living, about love, solidarity and respect, we still know very little. And if this is little we know, everything else will help very little to our long-awaited happiness.When you see ""Yojimbo,"" a movie filmed in 1961 and set in the nineteenth century, immediately feel that you are recreating life in the most marginalized neighborhoods of today (in microseconds) and the worst- governed countries (in macro).Akira Kurosawa, with his usual vigor and with that singular narrative black and white, reflecting the stories of the past, and he also uses for his known respect to which Japan considers permanent colors, tells a story that is very common among us: Two sides unscrupulous careerists, face one another for domination of a people. One is supported by the manufacturer of silk and the other the brewery. The police chief serves their interests, the coffin maker is hungry for bodies to evacuate its raw material, and among the people hiding fearing each day in the midst of scarcity and constantly fearing for their lives than to anyone matter.But as ever we are definitely alone, a man, a yojimbo (bodyguard), a powerful samurai warrior who feels he must play their part in that fateful battle front, enters the scene to see if he can avoid the shadows. And then, in an accurate reflection of a shameful and eternal reality, many things happen like that usually happen in men more absurd and blind. While these go to his traps, his brutality and obsessive siege, the people's side is no place for friendship, for faith in the other, and the exercise of solidarity, cunning and perseverance. Kurosawa makes us nod. Her film, half comic and half tragic, a western and as much as jeki jidai; remembered aspect, but inevitably present, has the smell of eloquent film, backed by a dense, neat art that deserves our applause and our greatest appreciation.And Toshiro Mifune is confirmed as a powerful actor histrionics, whose international success, and his constant presence in the films of the great Japanese master, was by no means a matter of influence, and yes, the deserved harvest of a committed and professional work as more.""Yojimbo"" is opening the gap of Eastern cinema that deserves many, many more spaces."
pranabchaudhury,"Jan 5, 2026",7/10,"Kurosawa is clearly having fun-and cutting deep. Toshiro Mifune's scruffy ronin strolls into a rotten town, smirks at everyone, and plays two gangs like a bored chess master. Sharp, violent, and wickedly funny, it sometimes feels like a parody, yet it's samurai cinema with attitude-and it still slaps. One of Kurosawa's best."
hrkepler,"Jun 12, 2018",9/10,"Very few men are cooler than Clint Eastwood, Toshiro Mifune is one of them. And very few directors can build up scene like Akira Kurosawa, Sergio Leone is not one of them (pretty close though). 'Yojimbo' is a film that is imitated (or remade) many times, but never as cleverly. It is not simple samurai action piece, but it actually explores much philosophical themes. Toshiro Mifune is a samurai who travels around the country until he reaches into town that is ruled by two rival families. The samurai sees the situation as an easy way to make some money, as he pours more fuel into the fire with doing small deeds to both families. Although we learn that the samurai is not only greedy swordsman, but his real motivations can be interpreted many ways by the end of the film. 'Yojimbo' might not be Kurosawa's best (I guess it can be debated) or deepest, but it's definitely his most entertaining ones."

This is the fifth Kurosawa film I have seen, and once again, it disappoints on a monumental level. Boring story, Slow pacing, mediocre acting, and yes I'll say it: poor directing. Listening to endless dialoge exposition and then watching action scenes consisting of characters running around like the Keystone Cops just isn't an artistic contribution to the hallmark of great film.

RM851222,"Jul 11, 2015",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Yôjinbô"" (1961) is a very entertaining movie even if you are watching it first time in 2015. Acting was very good, especially by Toshirô Mifune whom i didn't like much in previous Akira Kurosawa's movies - he was always overacting, playing it over the top. Here he is very good.Story itself is intriguing and very well paced, at running time 1 h 50 min this movie barely drags and is entertaining from start till finish. I read that ""Yôjinbô"" inspired many westerns and one was inspired by them and that is true - the plot is very similar here to many westerns, especially with Clint Eastwood famous ""Dollars"" trilogy.Overall, ""Yôjinbô"" can be safely called a classic, it's truly is, because even seeing this film first time in 2015 one can admire its craftsmanship. Story is intriguing, acting is good, and nevertheless you have seen this story by now many times, you should definitely check out ""Yôjinbô"" - it's great entertainment."

In 1964, ""Yojimbo"" was remade as ""A Fistful of Dollars"", a spaghetti western directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood... I love that American westerns inspired Japanese samurai films, which in turn inspired Italian westerns. Who would expect westerns to take such a detour?This film has awesome music, plenty of action, and even some humor (such as when the men are running around trying to catch the leaky sake).

Mert-35SD,"Aug 21, 2025",9/10,"Yojimbo feels to me like the true mother of spaghetti westerns. As much as I admire A Fistful of Dollars, Kurosawa's story fits this world far better. The clash between katana and gun carries a weight that no rifle-versus-revolver duel ever could.What makes the film shine is its masterful character design - from petty schemers and sycophants to the gray, cunning ronin who plays two rival gangs against each other. He is neither good nor evil, and that ambiguity makes him endlessly fascinating. His independence, his sly plans, and even small gestures - like scratching his cheek while half listening to his inner voice - elevate him into one of cinema's great anti-heroes.Alongside its character design, Kurosawa's unique sense of humor is also strikingly present in the film. You can clearly see how many of the dialogues went on to inspire Tarantino's films.Kurosawa also exposes the cowardice of groups, where trust is absent and fear binds people together. In contrast, the ronin's solitary courage and his fleeting act of compassion toward a broken man show us the ugliness of a changing world - and his quiet rebellion against it.At its core, this is a magnificent film, a true masterpiece. It answers essential cinematic questions: How should character design be approached? How should class distinctions be portrayed? How should virtues like cowardice, cunning, courage, and goodness be staged? For me, this is a work I will return to again and again in the future. Each time I watch it, I know I will discover something new."
ashirvadz,"Mar 3, 2013",10/10,"This is one of Kurosawa's most brilliant films. You can't miss it. There are elements of all the classical film storytelling: action, suspense, drama, mystery, Once you watch this movie, every other Kurosawa movie gains a different angle. Here he shows why he is Japan's most celebrated film maker. Even with the technical limitations of the time, he was able to portray a story that is old and surprisingly modern at the same time. This is not an easy task to accomplish, but he did so masterfully in this movie. Toshiro Mifume, who is present in many of Kurosawa's movies, plays impeccably the role of Sanjuro, a samurai without a lord. His confrontation with the gangster Unosuke sets the stage for this beautiful drama."
dusan-22,"Aug 29, 2009",10/10,"The most difficult comments are ones on the best films. It is very hard to explain and justify the value of such piece of art as Yojimbo. If we can categorize this film as action movie, than it is most probably the best action movie ever made, mass copied by the greatest action directors in Hollywood but everywhere else as well. I have to emphasize that best of them are not even close to Yojimbo. Not even close considering anything, so I will just sadly disregard dumb comments posted as Kurosawa Vs Sergio Leone. Is there anyone of you that can say: ""Mozart Vs Moricone""? Is that comparable? Well, I let that judgment to your gray cells responsible for art value and taste. Toshiro Mifune had represented the whole new movie culture until that time, the film idea of one man against the whole world. Yojimbo is someone who serves that idea originally and never seen until then - in traditional Japanese way. His later decent, Bruce Lee is putting that idea practically in the modern form: English language, western manners and western money. This is why I like to call Toshiro Mifune the spiritual father of modern action film, while Bruce Lee is a hero who was a practical establisher. Kurosawa is without doubt the greatest master of action movies of all times. His sense for dramatic directing, smart camera, short and dynamic dialogs and far best usage of music in action films makes him the grandmaster of its kind. He is manipulating with deepest human emotions of the spectator and by that Yojimbo is far from just action movie which makes it number one. What is the miraculous about this film is that it maintains your attention every single second on the highest level, involving you every single second deeper and deeper. There are no such movies any more. Considering the values of the votes on this site, I give Yojimbo 100 out of 10."
DVD Maniac,"Apr 20, 2000",N/A,"This film is one of the greatest films ever made. I highly recommend you pick the DVD and watch the wonderful Kurosawa at work. Milfune is excellent and proves his was one of the best actors who ever lived. The film was so good, it had been remade and re-worked quite a few times. One remake was the Bruce Willis ""Last Man Standing""."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Sep 18, 2020",7/10,"I was slightly disappointed with this, the story was very interesting at first, it was unpredictable and full of turns and twists of the situation that was going on. On the other hand, the second half went as predictable as it could. To be honest the plot is very similar to most Western movies about cowboys, all the story taking place in town and the hero is going to help it free from outlaws. The action scenes aged terribly, in other Samurai films they make smart camera cuts, but here you just see them swaying swords and killing each other without any blood or injuries.
This film is definitely watchable, but it could have been better."
illbebackreviews,"Mar 11, 2013",8/10,"I am new to Akira Kurasova's movies. I have heard so much great things from his movies, mainly from Seven Samurai. I will watch that later on especially after the amazement that I experienced by watching 'Yojimbo'.Yojimbo is one of the most original and earliest action movies directed by one of the greatest directors of all time, the Japanese Akira Kurasova. The film centers around a samurai without a master that wanders into a village that is separated and ruled by crime gangs: Inokichi, Ushitori and an aging Seibei. This mysterious Samurai walks into this town and decides to make a profit out of this by cleaning out the crime in this town, all the time, receiving money.Yojimbo is easily one of the most influential movies ever made with Sergio Leone, 3 years later, making a Spaghetti Western of the same movie called 'A Fistful of Dollars' The movie is just so likable and simply so entertaining to watch despite having to read subtitles the whole time. The movie has amazing music, perhaps some of the most epic I've ever heard, entertainingly and well written dialogue which has to be amazing since I was reading subtitles, by the look of it, great acting, an amazing story and such great characters.The action scenes in the movie didn't bother me. I was entertained. They don't look the most convincing but an amazing soundtrack, as present during these action scenes, easily makes me forget about the minor issue.Overall, 'Yojimbo' is a masterpiece in terms of movie history and should be watched by far more people. It is one of the earliest and most amazing action movies and even to this day, is still surprisingly watchable."
martijnterhaar,"Jul 22, 2025",6/10,"Yup, it's a Kurosawa: the visuals are great, the acting and humor an, uh, acquired taste - this movie has a stupid fat guy with a monobrow and bad teeth as comic relief - and having to eat gruel the worst thing that can happen to a person.And For a Fistful of Dollars did not just steal from this film; it's a straight up illegal remake. This film also invents The Man with No Name character and Clint Eastwood clearly copies Toshiro Mifune. Overall I'd say it's about a draw between the two versions. Kurosawa still has the upper hand here on Leone when it comes to craftsmanship and style (but not for long), but Leone gets rid of the most excessive slapstick overkill (never thought I'd pick a Leone film for the most naturalistic acting...), streamlines it a bit more and fixes some minor weak points in the plot."
riki85558,"Feb 6, 2014",10/10,"Yojimbo is one of the best foreign films of all time, this movie played a huge role in inspiring a fistful of dollars, this movie was also inspired by American westerns. the movie is shot in a similar way to those of the old black and white American western films. however this movie is by far in my top 10 favourite films. the movie also has brilliant music which you will get Goosebumps on your neck when hearing during the film. the sword fighting scenes are perfect, pure Japanese samurai style. the main character played by Toshiro Mifune is perfect and one of my most favourite main character of all time. this movie is perfect and original, flawless an absolute masterpiece from the master Akira Kurosawa."
Mercury-4,"Jul 22, 2007",10/10,"Kind of a weird hybrid between a samurai movie, a film noir, and Mad magazine.There is one shot in particular, towards the end where Gonji is hanging from a rope and there is a panning shot which shows his face, looking very unhappy, that reminds me very much of a Mort Drucker panel (I think it's Mort Drucker, the one who used to do the movie send-ups in the sixties and seventies).Throughout though, the style of the film ... I have probably seen this movie a hundred times, it is one of my favorites, and I have always had that feeling that it reminded me of something, then finally tonight it came to me. The gritty, dirty, comically ugly feel of the visual style overall ... it's a dead ringer for a Mad magazine movie satire."
Filmdokter,"Nov 27, 2021",8/10,"Yojinbo's plot is so simple yet so universal and enjoyable it has been told in a dozen other films. Most well known is of course A Fistful of Dollars. There is a lot to enjoy in Yojinbo. The mise-en-scene is perfect, the pacing excellent and in Toshiro Mifune you have the perfect anti-hero. I only saw it after I saw Sergio Leone's version (which I love) and in seeing how much the great Leone ""borrowed"" from Kurosawa, I can only say this was first and better."
deadjoe,"Jun 21, 2001",N/A,"People always say it was the better samurai flick of all time (with 7 Samurai). I have to admit, i not agree with that. It was a cool film (cool it's the word) and a perfect exemple of the kind of movies who was popular in Japan at this time. Chanbara (swordfight film) and Yakuza Eiga was the big deal in the 60's in Japan and this movie have all the elements. Kurosawa hate the Yakzua, it's the reason why he never made a Yakuza Eiga (to be a little bit harsh, i will say that's why critics know nothing about Yakzua Eiga, because Kurosawa never made this kind of genre altough it was one of the most popular genre in Japan). A lot of Jidai-geki with yakuza was made til 1910. But in this movie, they are ridicule and kill by Mifune.Like i said before, i dont think it's the better Kurosawa (i prefer High And Low or Rashomon) but it was funny. But i prefer Sanjuro, the sequel.The fact this movie have all this influence (people who disagree are blind) it's because it's one of the only chanbara we saw in occident. Chanbara was a genre very popular in japan, a very cool genre. But it's was one of the only of this kind. 7 Samurai or Rashomon was not chanbara, just jidai-geki.What my point? I think if another chanbara was show to us at this time, the people was enjoy it too. And maybe more. because in term of fun and quality, a lot of chanbara can be name. The Zatoichi serie or Nemury Kyoshiro (The first 3 films was a little bit boring for many people, but watch til the 4 episode.. it was very disturbing) or some Okamoto movies like Samurai Assassin with Mifune. And many directore like Kenji Misumi made a good technic work. and if you want deep drama and chanbara, i suggest Harakiri by Kobayashi.Yojimbo it's a fair movie to me, but not the greatest masterpiece of all time... It's my opinion."
lee_eisenberg,"Sep 20, 2005",7/10,"Obviously, anyone who knows anything about Japanese cinema has to know about Akira Kurosawa. And if they know about only a few of his movies, then ""Yojimbo"" has to be in there. The plot almost seems like something out of a western (""A Fistful of Dollars"" was in fact based on this movie), but is played to good effect. Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) is a samurai who comes to a town where some gangs have a stranglehold on everything. So, he decides to play them off against each other.Okay, so maybe ""Yojimbo"" isn't anything special in the grand scheme of things, but it's just neat how they did everything in this movie. So watch it; you're sure to like it."
axismladen,"Oct 18, 2011",10/10,"The first thing that the leading character in Yojinbo sees as he arrives in an unknown city is a dog with a human hand in his mouth. It's clear from the very beginning what kind of place it is - lonely and violent. One could easily replace it for one of the cities we're used to see in American westerns. A long dirty road with houses, saloons and shops on both sides. An image of post-apocalypse in a civilized world.The main character, best known simply as Samurai, is played by one of Kurosawa's favorites, Toshiro Mifune. Here he is a man with certain skills that allow him to be someone both sides would like to have on their side. Someone they're ready to pay a lot of money to have him on their side. He knows it and plans to use it. The trouble comes when a gunslinger comes to town. He is far more suspicious and much more feared than others. The Samurai is not too worried with him at first, as he knows he is a better killer, but he underestimates how things can easily turn out to be completely different from what he expected if only someone would rock the boat a bit. ------- ''''SPOILER'''' ------ And the person who eventually does it turns out to be he him self, his empathy, to be exact.Yojimbo is a very complexed story presented more as an action movie than a historical drama like some other Kurosawa's work including Seven Samurai and even something newer like Kagemusha, Ran etc. However, that does not make it less important or worse. To contrary, it's one of Kurosawa's most entertaining movies with a lot more hiding under the surface. I'd definitely recommend it to everyone. Whether you're an average viewer or a movie buff, this is definitely a movie that has the quality to please both."
mrdonleone,"Apr 26, 2009",6/10,"this movie contains of three parts. the first part is really interesting. it tells us the history of the male characters (there are as good as no women in the town) and how they relate to each other. it's good to know where Clint Eastwood found his image and where Leone found his western stories.the second part, however, is boring. things go wrong when the good reveals its face, you can actually tell how this story is going to end. you are hoping time will fly to kiss this BEEP goodbye.but the third part is the best of the whole picture. it's the final 'shoot out', only presented here with swords. about these swords: the fighting scenes are really bad performed, but we have to remind ourselves this was a movie made in '61 and that it did not come from America, so they had not the same spectacular special effects.one last thing however: the towns (or places) in Kurosawa's films contain as good as no women (something they took over in modern westerns). no women... it makes you think about the true meaning of the films of Kurosawa."
eyeache,"Mar 3, 2009",1/10,"To anyone who hasn't seen Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars was a great film. To anyone (honest) who has seen Yojimbo, A Fistful of Dollars is still a great film. But will anyone admit it? There only seem to be about two honest reviewers on this site. Although Fistful helped me to understand a little of what was going on, I still didn't understand most of it. I wouldn't have understood anything at all if I hadn't seen Clint and Leone. Towards the end, try as I might, I couldn't help skipping chunks, and I'm sure I didn't miss anything. Mifune had quite good presence, and he had a very healthy appetite and was very thirsty. There was at least one pretty girl. And there was a remarkable midget holding an enormous mallet. Sorry folks, that was it for me. At some future time, when I'm feeling really strong and masochistic, I'll try again, with the commentary option to explain it to me and tell me why it's so fabulous. Sayonara."
coconutkungfu-30704,"Feb 19, 2020",8/10,"As usual when it comes to Kurosawa the film is very nicely directed, while the plot is an interesting one about warring gangs and a Samurai that pits them against each other. Toshiro Mifune is very cool in this film and I especially enjoyed the great music.8 out of 10!"
GyatsoLa,"Jul 28, 2007",9/10,"Simply one of the coolest movies ever made. Tight, beautifully edited, sharp, funny and action packed - its been copied many times, but rarely matched.What a lot of people miss about this movie is the darkness of the comedy - there are multiple references here to what Kurosawa saw as the corruption of post war Japanese society - especially the relations of the merchants (corporations) and the gangsters (yakuza). In showing the hero as almost as cynical as the bad guys - and refusing to give the bad guys any redeeming features this is actually a movie that is dark and pessimistic in a way that goes far beyond the many imitators. But somehow, it is still funny and riveting to watch. It also has one of the most effective soundtracks of any movie I've ever seen."
moviestics,"Jan 23, 2014",8/10,"Review #4.Yojimbo, bodyguard in Japanese, is another beauty from Akira Kurosawa. When I watched Seven Samurai, I was very much taken aback by Kurosawa's talent as a director and as a writer. From then on, I always wanted to watch more of his creations.Yojimbo is a samurai based film. A samurai comes to an unpleasant, miserable village, where there is a war going on between two groups of gamblers. Both of them want him as their bodyguard. But something very different is going on in his mind. What is it? Well, you'll have to see the film.The performances are top notch. The direction is superb. Some scenes are so good that you eventually remember Seven Samurai. The writing is very tight. Music goes on with the pace and demand of the film.The final verdict : Kurosawa's one of the finest films. Must not be missed."
Prismark10,"Jun 21, 2014",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa teams up again with Toshiro Mifune to give us a wily and cynical Ronin who enters a one horse town in conflict and sees an opportunity to make money as well as ending the conflict.The film's plot has been remade many times, most famously as a A Fistful of Dollars starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Sergio Leone.Mifune is a cunning Samurai, expert with the sword and ruthless. He is an anti hero but does show a warm nature however willing to play off the rival factions who bring misery to the small town.Mifune is the original The man with no name, a character that would become famous and forever associated with Eastwood.The film starts with a cracking pace and immediately gets to the plot with little flab before hitting the conventions dramatic plot devices that we are familiar with but this film inspired it.Mifune is terrific as the world weary ronin willing to swap sides when one of the rivals has the upper hand. He shows a devilish touch of touch of humour and although the film slackens later on, you have to see it because of its influence on cinema."
swinters47,"Dec 8, 2003",N/A,"A friend of mine had been hyping up this movie to me for several months, so I finally sat down to watch it tonight.  Overall, I'd have to say that it lived up to its reputation.  Even though I wasn't really in the mood for it at the start, it drew me in and kept me glued to the TV screen for two full hours.I think enough people have already commented on the plot of the movie (and how cool they think Toshiro Mifune is), so I won't waste your time with more such drivel here...Instead, what interested me most about this movie tonight was how many elements of it I'd already seen before.  For instance, close to the beginning of the film, Mifune's character kills a couple of henchmen and then lops off the arm of another--and then you see the poor guy's dismembered arm, lying on the ground, still holding on to his katana. It's impossible to watch this shot and not immediately think of the bloody arm that Obi-Wan has dismembered in the cantina scene in the first Star Wars movie.Elements of Star Wars are all over this film, in fact: from the moment Mifune pops out a couple of floorboards to leave his hiding place (think of Han and Luke on the Millennium Falcon) to the sweeping, horizontal wipe transitions you see between each scene.  Like Obi-Wan, Mifune's ""Man with No Name"" is a wandering, mystic warrior--one of the last of his kind.  And the mercenary element of a character like Han Solo is lived out large here, too, by Mifune's character.But that's just it.  As someone has already pointed out here, this movie began the 1960s/1970s ""deconstruction of the Western""--the good/bad distinction disappears, and there's just Mifune's Yojimbo to play two despicable rich men (and their cronies) off of each other.  When Mifune actually does something decent for another human being in the film, it comes as kind of a shock.  But at the end of the movie--when he comes back to fight the ""bad"" guys--he's not fighting them for any noble purpose, or to help out the poor, old townspeople.  He just wants payback.This is the kind of nihilistic, beyond-good-and-evil stuff that we've seen so often (and loved so much) in action films ever since.  It's not about the triumph of principle over chaos--it's about the triumph of the individual over the masses.  We've seen this thing so many times by now that I think it's difficult for us to appreciate in a film that's seen so many years go by (and been copied as often) as Yojimbo.  In fact, those who are looking for lots of melodramatic action sequences and overly drawn out fight scenes will probably be disappointed by this ""action"" movie--its violence is too curt to be really satisfying.What strikes me now, though, is that one of the reasons movies like Star Wars and Indiana Jones and everything else that came out of the Lucas/Spielberg era were so successful is because they injected the old good vs. evil theme back into the Western-style movie.  They just had to transfer their settings to places far away from the American West.  It's like--after Kurosawa and Leone and Eastwood and Don Siegel had had their say--we had to go somewhere else besides the Old West to get what we were really looking for.There's no such triumph of good over evil here.  Just one badass dude making the best of a bad situation.  Check it out if that's the sort of thing you want to see."
matt caccamo,"Jan 3, 2002",7/10,"A crafty Kurosawa film featuring a samurai, jobless in mid-1800s Japan, who finds a town split between two competing warlords and decides to play each side off against each other in order to rid the town of violence.  Wonderful acting, fine cinematography, beautiful costumes, and some nice humor as well.  It moves at a wonderfully deliberate pace, which does not bore but instead makes you hungry for more intrigue and suspense.  This film was the inspiration for `A Fistful of Dollars' and many others to follow (`Last Man Standing'), but it has never been done quite as well.  Not Kurosawa's best film but fairly close to it.  Followed by a sequel, `Sanjuro,' in 1962. Nominated for Academy Award for Best Costume Design  Black and White"
iaincowie,"Aug 29, 2000",1/10,A movie thats best ideas have been copied to death. Watch Darth Maul wait for Obi- one behind the red energy curtain and tell me that didn't come directly from this movie. And that's the real problem. Why watch a movie that has nothing original in it which is worth watching? It's all been better done since. The dialogue sounds like a 1970s British costume drama (I speak Japanese so I know what I'm talking about) and the subtitling is simply dire. This is the 'Kind of Blue' of movies- no one has actually watched it (no one has listened to the Miles Davis album) but everyone says its the best movie they've ever seen. Avoid. 4/10
jose-cruz53,"Oct 7, 2012",9/10,"Kurosawa, like Kubrick, is one of those directors whose movies look better today than when they were released. This film, for instance, clearly shows its influences, as previously mentioned, Tarantino films have a great deal of influence from this single piece alone. And this film is as good as anything Tarantino done, including Pulp Fiction.I was also impressed by a greater degree by this film than Seven Samurai, which is another excellent film. However, this one benefits from being made 7 years later, Kurosawa probably had a bigger budget and the quality of the cinematography has greatly improved (at least from the versions that I have watched).Highly recommended to anybody who likes a good film."
KIDOLOHKEN,"Sep 15, 2025",10/10,"In this sense, Yojimbo may well be Akira Kurosawa's greatest achievement.The film, in fact, had a hidden origin: an American hard-boiled novel. Screenwriter Ryuzo Kikushima first adapted the novel into a samurai setting and brought it to Kurosawa, with the idea that the credits would acknowledge an original source. But as the two of them went back and forth-""This way will be more interesting,"" ""No, let's change this""-the story drifted so far from its starting point that they ultimately released it as an ""original."" Kurosawa himself later admitted in an interview: ""Perhaps I should have credited the original author-I borrowed a lot of ideas, after all.""What this tells us is how much Kurosawa poured his whole being into the script. He was not only a genius but also a relentless worker. During the winter shoot of Seven Samurai, the actors would warm themselves in hot baths after their scenes, while Kurosawa remained drenched, standing for hours in the cold. There are even stories of him refusing an umbrella, soaked through, simply to keep rain noise from being picked up on the microphone.When I first watched Yojimbo, I thought it was just an entertaining story. But the more times I saw it, the clearer it became: this was more than a story. Toshiro Mifune's wandering ronin never plans to save the village-he just improvises for his own amusement, letting whim guide him. It's this seemingly aimless string of actions that makes each episode so fascinating. As a coherent ""story,"" it is chaotic-hardly a model script.But cinema, I believe, is not truly about story. If the script is excellent, of course the movie will be entertaining-just as in The Shawshank Redemption. The real height of film artistry is turning a weak script into a great movie. Kurosawa himself once said: ""You can make a bad movie out of a good script, but you can never make a good movie out of a bad script."" And yet with Yojimbo, he proved himself wrong. He turned a script that is, in many ways, a mess into one of the most entertaining films ever made.Watching it in Japanese adds another layer. The dialogue is witty, stylish, and perfectly matched to Mifune's voice and performance. Masaru Sato's score drives the energy, while the widescreen format and stark black-and-white contrasts create tension that plays beautifully against the freewheeling narrative. The imbalance is strange, but it produces a singular cinematic experience.Yojimbo is perhaps the most unique fusion of pure entertainment and high artistry in Kurosawa's career. He always aimed at popular appeal, yet his rare artistic sensibility shone through. Here, those two forces collided like lightning-and crystallized into a masterpiece."
drewconnor,"Jan 17, 2014",10/10,"Its no wonder that Sergio Leone used every last detail of Yojimbo to write A Fist Full of Dollars this film is bordering on perfection.Toshiro Mifune tosses a stick in the air to see in which way to travel and the rest is straight out of legend.The film has its comic moments,all the baddies look like they have come from a horror movie set,one in particular looks like Lurch from the Adams family but the entire plot down to the finest detail was used by Leone for his first Dollar film.Mifune sucks on a straw whilst Clint sucks on a cheroot,even Wanderdios the crazy bell ringer is there and the undertaker.Yojimbo is the film A Fist Full of Dollars should have been.Leones first outing lacks the style and cinematography of the final two but Yojimbo in Japanese ranks alongside Throne of Blood as one of the greatest Japanese films of all time.The atmosphere and comic dialogue is one of a master director at work and the film sets and special effects are truly excellent.If there is only one Kirosawa film you should see then Yojimbo is it because the atmosphere and acting especially by Mifune are of the highest standard."
drqshadow-reviews,"Aug 13, 2020",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa and Toshiro Mifune collaborate again for the eighth chapter in a long and fruitful cinematic partnership. This act finds Mifune in a classic role: the cynical old samurai who rumbles into a small town, makes an impression and immediately lights the fuse to a long-simmering gang war. Casually manipulating both sides, if only to amuse himself and torment the unjust, he eventually presses his luck too far, gets in hot water and transforms the dalliance into an icy tale of violence and vengeance.As usual, Mifune makes the part his own, stirring a delicious blend of bold irreverence and well-earned arrogance; always the coolest guy in the room, even when he's held captive and taking a beating. There's something about the way he carries himself - the nonchalance with which he strolls through a line of armed men, the raging tempest in his eyes - that tells us this guy is cut from a totally different cloth.As with most lone samurai films, this one is both influenced by, and influential toward, the gun-slinging American western genre. In this case, Sergio Leone borrowed liberally from the plot for 1964's A Fistful of Dollars, sparking a legal struggle that delayed the spaghetti western's American release for years. Kurosawa often referenced the work of John Ford as a heavy personal influence, and the roots of this film are actually seeded in an American novel from the 1930s, so the lawsuit seems contradictory, but hey, that's how it went down. Either way, Yojimbo is a great one. Easy to watch, appreciate, and get wrapped up inside. I'd recommend it to anyone."
lady_colubris,"Apr 23, 2003",N/A,"With a Japanese professor who was completely obsessed with Toshiro Mifune, it's no surprise that we watched this film in class. I came into it thinking that it was going to be boring. I couldn't have been more wrong. As far as action films are concerned, this is probably one of the best I've seen. (The guy with the pistol was kinda goofy, though :P) And the sequel Sanjuro is even better! Definitely worth watching! Rating: 9 out of 10."

SAMTHEBESTEST,"Jul 12, 2020",8/10,"Yojimbo (1961) :
Brief Review -A Benchmark Samurai Japanese Film in Action and Machoism theories used for years all over the world. Remember any Western Classic from 60s and how much we all love them but what was it which was made before them and left influences? Here it is, Yojimbo. A benchmark in Action Oriented Cinema and Positive Machoism of the Protagonist. Yojimbo is about a crafty Samurai who arrives in a town which is divided by two criminal gangs and he decides to play them against each other to free the town and to earn money for himself. Unlike other Westerns made in the decade or before this one, Yojimbo doesn't really try to glorify the hero as a Good Man, even though he does some good things. All of sudden a Man with no morals and kindness does the Most Kind thing of his life and get punished. Later, his revenge begins and we find ourselves in Action Packed Zone. The production design of the film needs to mentioned on high priority because there are many details to know. It's just a Town, but the set-up, the places, the planning everything is smartly crafted. Toshiro Mufine as a deadly ronin shines like the first ever lovable Ronin. His macho image held my head and heart throughout the film. There are too many Supporting actors to name for thier acting efforts but to keep it short, all are Good. Background Score and Cinematography is unique and influential for this genre. Akira Kurosawa is a Master Director and it's proven again with this film. Yojimbo may not be philosophical and subtle like 'Roshomon' but it has everything for what it was made. Kurosawa took the perfect regional flavour and grinded it smoothly while pouring this yummy flour. This early Spicy Action Film for movie goers deserves all the reputation and legacy it carries. A Classic Samurai Phenomena.RATING - 8/10*By - #samthebestest"
filipemanuelneto,"Dec 19, 2024",6/10,"Even though I don't really like samurai films, I respect the remarkable work of Akira Kurosawa and his lasting legacy to Japanese cinema. In this film, this notable director returns to his favorite themes - which earned him other works of, eventually, greater merit, such as ""Ran"" and ""Rashomon"" - portraying the adventures of a ronin, a samurai with no master to serve who wanders through the villages of feudal Japan. It turns out that the village where he ends up is being fought over by two rival factions, and he decides to sell his services as a mercenary to both sides, thinking he will be able to free the peasants from the tyranny of those violent men. Of course, it all ends in a bloodbath, to the delight of the audience.The film is quite violent in several aspects: not only does it give us a series of battles and bloody fights, it also gives us a particularly dark portrait of that period, with humiliatingly servile people, injustices that go unpunished and the absolute arbitrariness of the most powerful. This portrait reminds us a little of the US Wild West, if we remove the sheriffs and leave the land under the control of criminals. I think that's why this type of film was so well received in the Western market. In fact, this was Kurosawa's first film to meet this projection and open the doors to the international recognition we know.Considering that I'm far from being a Kurosawa fan, and even liking this type of film, it's already a victory to say that I liked what I saw and didn't feel bored or tired as the film unfolded. Toshiro Mifune, the director's favorite actor, does an impeccable job in the main role, although very much in line with what we've seen in other Kurosawa's films. Tatsuya Nakadai also does a job well done and gives us a worthy opponent for the hero. The cinematography is quite eloquent and makes the film work elegantly, even though it seems quite different to what I'm used to in Western cinema."
badar1981,"Feb 13, 2007",9/10,"Kurosawa film is always special and like others the very film is also sensational. From the very outset when the son of a farmer told his father that he is not going to eat the ordinary food all his life till the end when he was told by the Yojimbo that it is better to eat then to die. Each and everything needs a special praise and all is done very masterly. We can see Kurosawa stamp all over the movie specially the rain seen, that is just brilliant. From dialogs to acting, production to direction and very unusual for Kurosawa movie music is spot on in fact very good. Lighting and other effects in the street are beautifully executed.I watched Sergio's trilogy before getting hand on this, but it is worth watching both as both has their own class.Tushiro Mufin is excellent so as the rest of the cast.A must watch!! 9/10."
CostinP-1,"Apr 18, 2025",10/10,"YOJIMBO is an action drama about a ronin who finds himself at the center of a conflict between the two crime lords.A hungry and tired ronin wanders through a desolate Japanese countryside. Soon, he arrives in a small town. A local caterer advises him to leave because, two local clans fight every day on the streets. However, a stranger decides to stay. The situation in a town is very good for one ronin. This is a good chance that he earns some money. However, he does not need a bloody money. He wants to destroy local crime lords...This tense story is full of lies, doubt, turning, pranks, blackmails and excellent fights. A careless and seemingly insensitive samurai is actually a peaceful and good man. Mr. Kurosawa has, under the influence of a western and noir, made a very exciting and visually impressive film. Of course, he has not neglected the significant situations that are related to the Japanese culture and tradition.Close-ups, almost perfectly, reflect an evil, arrogance, fear, invincibility and contempt on faces of some of the protagonists. There is a large number of villains, which are quite different in character.Toshiro Mifune (Kuwabatake Sanjuro) is a resourceful, interesting and determined as a wandering ronin and master swordsman. He, apparently, enjoys in his machinations, however, his goal is extremely benevolent. He's kind of a lone hero, regardless of a tactical evil and theatrical swagger in his character.His support are Tatsuya Nakadai as Unosuke a wild and insolent gunslinger and the biggest threat to a samurai. He is interesting because he is a completely different character from Sanjuro. Kyu Sazanka (Ushitora) and Seizaburo Kawazu (Seibei) are fairly inconclusive as crime lords. However their primary relationship ""of a teacher and his student"", could be interesting. Isuzu Yamada as Orin is the the wife of Seibei. She is perhaps an initiator of conflicts. Daisuke Kato as Inokichi is a visually the most memorable character. A character, who is capable to commit a vicious murder, but also make the greatest stupidity.Simply, Mr. Kurosawa has managed to combine several styles in a small masterpiece."
Vartiainen,"Oct 30, 2017",8/10,"A lonely mercenary arrives in town, finding it torn between two feuding families. Seeing a chance to earn a few coins he decides to sell his services as a killer to the highest bidder. In the process he ends up escalating the feud, turning the families against each other even worse than they already were. Sound familiar? That might be because this Akira Kurosawa film was remade in the West a few years later. Starring Clint Eastwood, the film was named A Fistful of Dollars. Perhaps you've heard of it.Keeping that in mind, the film is a fascinating watch. So many of the idiosyncrasies of spaghetti westerns can be explained by the fact that ultimately they're based on Japanese samurai films. The lonely, wandering hero. The gruff antihero that still ends up saving the day. The corruptibility of officials.It's also to be kept in mind that this is an Akira Kurosawa film. And quite honestly one of the best ones I've seen from him. The setting of the town is not all that big. A single street with a few important buildings, really. Yet it is used beautifully and the viewer becomes intimately familiar with it throughout the course of the film. Full props to Toshiro Mifune as well, playing the lead character, the cold and lethal ronin, who still hides a beating heart beneath his tattered clothes. One of his defining roles for a reason.Is the film without flaws? Not entirely. The musical cues are sometimes less than subtle, which is actually pretty common with Kurosawa, and the fight scenes, inventive though as they are, lack certain polish. A sword might miss by several hand-widths, yet the opponent still screams and falls. Small touches like that.Still, the story and the characters are so great here that I'm fully comfortable calling this better than A Fistful of Dollars. Not by much, but it does beat that classic. And that's saying something."
I_Ailurophile,"May 20, 2024",10/10,"Though in the first place it's effectively suggested by the very premise of two rival gangs being played against each other, there's no mistaking how playful this tends to be, and wryly so, maybe more than anything else Kurosawa Akira had made up to this point. The plot is teased out with relatively sparing action, atypical for a samurai flick, as clever ronin Sanjuro seeds the roiling animosities between the two factions, and iconic star Mifune Toshiro portrays the antihero with levelheaded nuance that allows him to nimbly ride the line between shrewd, sardonic wit and the cold, calculating intelligence of a man seething at injustice. Even the original music of esteemed composer Sato Masaru tends toward jaunty themes that echo the jestful spirit, belying the more somber and violent underpinnings. Rest assured that all component parts shift just as dexterously to an earnest, serious tone as the narrative and scene writing demand, especially in the latter half, yet compared even to subsequent titles that adapt the tale to a new setting, the overall tenor here is more reserved than one might suppose sights unseen. But then, master that Kurosawa is, and stellar as his collaborators are, all that really means is more of an opportunity for the saga to be realized to its maximum potency, and 'Yojimbo' is without question another superb, essential classic.Time and again in his roles Mifune stuns with a deft mix of stone-faced severity and imposing physicality on the one hand, and on the other, terrific subtlety and range, and his turn here is no different. This is hardly to count out anyone else involved; only as a matter of their prominence do some stand taller than others, with Tono Eijiro, Nakadai Tatsuya, Sawamura Ikio, and Kawazu Seizaburo, among others, making a big impression. Between their own great abilities and the filmmaker's infamous, perfectionist precision, all those in supporting parts are just as outstanding with fulfilling their parts in the tableau. And given Kurosawa's arduous, hard-boiled approach to film-making, how much should we even try to separate his direction from the screenplay he developed with Oguni Hideo and Kikushima Ryuzo? The story is marvelously smart and well-rounded, ranging from that morbid friskiness, to stark violence, to sincere, heartfelt drama, with each mood delighting in turn as the proceedings flow smoothly back and forth through to the end. The scenes as written and orchestrated are stupendously strong and varied, with fantastic artistic flourishes every now and again, and even the characters and dialogue are joyfully vibrant both on paper and in execution. No filmmaker who has taken cues from this picture, not even Sergio Leone, has managed to replicate the exquisite brilliance that Kurosawa accomplished down to every last detail.Those details include not just Sato's genuinely fun, enticing score, or the invigorating fight choreography, stunts, and effects, but the meticulously crafted sets, costume design, hair, and makeup, and Miyagawa Kazuo's keen, adept cinematography. It seems readily evident, in watching this feature, just how fastidious Kurosawa was as a storyteller and director, and whatever else that reputation meant for him personally or professionally, it also ensured that his works would go down in the annals of cinema history as stunning masterpieces while other filmmakers could only aspire to meet the same level. It's not that 'Yojimbo' is as outwardly grabbing or totally rewarding as some of its kin, but as the saga unfolds we see more and more the skill and ingenuity behind the patient, careful construction and plot development, and like the protagonist's scheme, the fruits of that labor speak for themselves. When all is said and done this is just as absorbing, entertaining, and satisfying as one would ever anticipate of Kurosawa, and any discrepancy we might discern in quality is a matter only of personal preference and splitting hairs. One way or another, what it comes down to without fail is that 'Yojimbo' is another sparkling gem in an already resplendent crown, and there can never be any doubt that Kurosawa's legend is secure as one of the very best filmmakers to ever live. Though the violence is pretty substantial at times, primarily in the back end, otherwise this is so tremendous and important a movie that I think it exists beyond any questions of personal taste, and I have no qualms in recommending it to one and all. As far as I'm concerned this is a must-see for anyone who enjoys films, and I'm happy to give it my very high and enthusiastic recommendation!"
MrBiddle,"Nov 10, 2004",N/A,"Very entertaining movie. I've seen the moments that inspired the Mos Eisley confrontation scene in Star Wars A New Hope. Or how Charlie Brown greets O-Ren Ishii and her body guards in Kill Bill. What was very interesting to see was our hero and how much his sword does for him, and the villain, how he feels naked without his gun.Watch for the once headstrong and arrogant kid turning yella in the end, ""Go home,a long life eating porridge is best."" Perfect framing and multiplanar visual storytelling with exciting moments of Sanjuro taking on multiple opponents; he sets up a scene and makes it look like 15 or 16 men did it. But the later scenes where we see our hero's slow-side indeed has impact because of how opposite and vulnerable he becomes after we've seen his audacity in early scenes.Yojimbo is Grade A in my opinion. 10/10"
briancham1994,"Apr 26, 2021",7/10,"Akira Kurosawa shows his expert crafting in this film. He has a great ability to construct everything very thoughtfully - the framing, cinematography, action and acting show a great deal of artistic care. The portrayal of the lead samurai is stoic, detached, shrewd and nigh-invincible, an archetype that is as influential as the film itself. The samurai is victorious through a combination of strength, wits and compassion, no matter what happens. Like Seven Samurai (which I actually think is the superior film), Kurosawa goes deeply into the conditions of the town, the brewing conflict and the plight of the characters to make the environment feel real and the issue feel pressing. At the end, this makes it feel like a real hard-won victory that the audience has almost participated in."
ferguson-6,"Dec 31, 2013",8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Yojimbo translates to bodyguard, but do not make the mistake of comparing it to the 1992 sappy mess The Bodyguard (Kevin Costner, Whitney Houston). This is one of the finest Japanese films ever made, directed by arguably the greatest Japanese director (Akira Kurosawa), and starring one of the top Japanese actors (Toshiro Mifune). It also served as the inspiration for Sergio Leone's classic 1964 western, A Fistful of Dollars (with Clint Eastwood).Based in 1860, we meet the unemployed ronin/samurai (Mifune) wandering the countryside allowing a tossed tree branch to determine the direction of his path. It leads him to a town where the ominous first visual is a dog carrying a human hand in his mouth. We realize this isn't going to be the most welcoming of towns.The town is controlled by rival factions: the Silk merchant versus the Sake brewer. They represent crime lords Seibel and Ushitora, respectively. Our clever ronin decides to play both sides against the middle and ends up hired as a bodyguard by BOTH gangs. As you can imagine, this leads to real problems for all involved.The psychology of (corrupt) power and fear is in play here, as is some dark humor (the coffin maker). The biggest clash comes with Unosuke who proudly carries the town's only pistol. He certainly enjoys the respect and power that comes with that handgun. The samurai are trained to be loyal at any cost, and it's quite interesting to see our protagonist adapt the self-preservation in his new world.Masaru Sato delivers a very unique score - one quite unusual for the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune has one of the great faces in cinematic history, and Kurosawa is in prime form. This is definitely one to see if you enjoy the best films from all countries."
ozguredizavci,"Sep 3, 2022",7/10,"An enjoyable film with fluent story, but still has all the features of old Japanese cinematography: Long scenes with lots of glancing, all characters behave pure emotionally except main character, etc.The storytelling of this film is a little bit complicated. There are lots of names and characters. It would be better if the side characters had more descriptive scenes instead of glancing scenes. I would never have guessed that I would say this about an old Japanese film, but I think it would be better if this film was a little bit longer.Normally this film deserves an 8 rating, the story is interesting and the film is not boring. But I did not know that this film was inspired by a book. Because of this, I rate it 7."
zzhhhqing,"May 20, 2020",1/10,"Rely on your own strength to save the era of rites and bad crashes. The bad guy is dead and the town is peaceful. But after the story ends, it will still be shrouded in evil forces. It's like Misato Min Lang finally told the shop owner that you should hang your guilt. Peace is short, no matter how sharp the sword is, it also cuts away the evils of the world, because that is a chaotic era."
jannispetersen,"Jan 19, 2008",10/10,"Well. This was my first Kurosawa film by now... but will definitely not be my last one! Let me first say this: Instead of going into town, I decided to stay home alone and watch this movie. And now afterwards I must say: It was totally worth it! The camera in this movie turns very slowly and the screens stay focus on pictures for a long time, also the movie actually lasts two hours - but altogether comes down in a flash, as so it only were 10 minutes. Do not get bothered about that this is a black/white movie, this actually gives it the right flare and impression. This movie does not need colors, or let me put it this way: the black and white colors simply fit to the storyline. Well, the storyline: Classic and awesome. The good old lonely, silent, mystified hero against the whole world. Characters really are deep and all of them their own kind, as you haven't seen them in another movie of this kind yet.10 Stars from me!"
kevin_robbins,"Dec 4, 2025",8/10,"I recently rewatched the classic Yojimbo (1961) on MAX. The storyline follows a lone samurai who wanders into a town torn apart by two rival gangs, with innocent townspeople caught in the middle. He decides to infiltrate both factions, pit them against each other, and join the chaos once the bloodshed begins-ensuring that both sides ultimately meet their demise.This film is directed by the legendary Akira Kurosawa (Ran) and stars Toshiro Mifune (Seven Samurai), Eijirô Tôno (Tora! Tora! Tora!), Isuzu Yamada (Throne of Blood), and Yôko Tsukasa (Samurai Saga).The movie plays very much like a spaghetti western: a cool, unbothered wanderer strolls into town, recognizes the trouble, sizes it up, and dismantles it piece by piece-only this time, it's a samurai instead of a cowboy. Mifune delivers an unforgettable performance; he's slick, charismatic, and utterly commanding, with elite choreography whether he's facing one opponent or a hundred.The production design-settings, costumes, and props-pulls you into the world instantly, and the writing is equally strong. Heroes and villains are sharply defined, the cultural texture runs throughout, and the soundtrack enhances the mood at every turn. There's a lot to appreciate here.In conclusion, Yojimbo is an iconic samurai film and an essential watch for fans of the genre. I would score it 8/10 and strongly recommend it."
Steffi_P,"Feb 26, 2007",9/10,"A year before Yojimbo, Kurosawa made a film called The Bad Sleep Well. A savage indictment of corporate and governmental corruption, it was a disappointment to audiences because of its downbeat (yet realistic) ending, and a disappointment to Kurosawa because he couldn't safely go as far as he wanted to in his critique. With Yojimbo, he solved both problems by doing a lose remake in a period setting.The world of Yojimbo is as full of corruption, betrayal and heartlessness as any Film Noir. The two merchants Tokuemon and Tazaemon are powerful yet decadent and, as their names suggest, there is little to choose between them. The town guard is a weak, toadying little man, and the government inspector grows rich from bribes. The hired killers of Seibei and Ushi-Tora represent the gangsters of modern Japan  a common target of Kurosawa's, but here the link between them and the establishment is made explicit. However, because it was staged as a Samurai action flick, Kurosawa was able to have this rogues gallery of bad guys wiped out by an invincible hero, giving the audience the satisfaction they would be denied in a straight, contemporary drama.But the allegory wasn't the only item on Kurosawa's agenda. As in his previous Samurai films, he was always looking to reinvent the Japanese period film, in particular to move away from the rigid moralism and ritual of the feudal setting. However, if Seven Samurai only pushed the conventions of the genre, Yojimbo leaves them in tatters. Once again, the hero is a masterless Samurai, the lowest of the low in feudal Japan  but Sanjuro doesn't care, and isn't interested in regaining his honour. He's content to be a drifter and a mercenary. He is to the typical Samurai hero what Sam Spade (from The Maltese Falcon) is to Sherlock Holmes.In the Bad Sleep Well, a kind of satirical cartoonishness was starting to creep into Kurosawa's work. In Yojimbo this is exaggerated even further, with Kurosawa picking the most grotesque and freakish looking character actors to play the mobsters and bloated authority figures. Unosuke, played by Tatsuya Nakadai (who was to become a Kurosawa regular, and would eventually replace Toshiro Mifune as his lead man), makes a brilliantly psychotic arch villain. For the most part though, the bad guys are simply made to look ridiculous, and Yojimbo does have elements of comedy about it. Sanjuro on the other hand, is calm, collected and somewhat aloof, a role Mifune (now a mature actor in his 40's) was ideally suited to. Kurosawa has him as a passive, silent observer through most of the picture. However, as is revealed in the scene where he watches the two opposing from the top of the watchtower, he is really the puppet master of the story.Kurosawa's direction is tight as ever. This was his best use of the 'scope aspect ratio yet. He organises some brilliant shots of the two opposing gangs, showing them as almost identical. There's also some self-reference of the short, wide aspect ratio, with Sanjuro peering through narrow window slits, further reinforcing the idea that he is an observer. There's a great use of percussive noises  the guard bashing his sticks together, gunshots, not to mention the music  which give the whole film a tense kind of rhythm.One of my favourite things about Yojimbo is the way the scenario gradually builds up and becomes more intense as the film progresses. There's an eerie calm at the beginning, and when we first see the gangs face each other they are reluctant to fight and just make gestures and threats. Then, as Sanjuro and Unosuke become involved everything becomes more and more chaotic, with killings, double crossings and eventually huge massacres taking place. When Sanjuro returns for the final showdown with the Ushi-Tora gang the tension is incredible. Every shot and every edit at this point is perfect, and I'd say it's one of the best scenes Kurosawa ever directed.Also worth a brief mention is the rain. Kurosawa was famous for his use of rain, but not only did he use it a lot, he also uses it very differently to the average director. Whereas the rain device is often employed rather obviously for a sad moment or pivotal scene, Kurosawa uses it much subtly and Yojimbo is one of the best examples. When the inspector visits, everyone stops fighting and it begins to rain. Because of the weather, it reminds me more than anything of a stoppage of play during a sports match, or kids having to play indoors on a rainy day  very suitable for the tone of the film at this point.In mixing his social allegory with tense action and pure fun, Kurosawa came up with a winning formula, and this is among his strongest and most enjoyable films."
Leofwine_draca,"Dec 22, 2014",8/10,"The last of Kurosawa's samurai films I had on my list to watch, as I actually saw the sequel to this (SANJURO) beforehand. Not that it matters, as the two films feature the same character but have totally unconnected stories. I actually liked SANJURO the better of the two, mainly because it was funnier and more tightly scripted. However, there's no denying that YOJIMBO is a great movie in itself, a film both highly influenced by westerns and which would highly influence westerns to come (Sergio Leone famously 'borrowed' the story for his iconic classic A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS).The story is taken from the pages of pulp fiction and involves a rogue samurai (Toshiro Mifune, on top form) who comes into a rural town and finds a war going on between opposing gangs. Determined to clean up the mess, he plays both sides against one another, with the stakes gradually raising as the action ensues. Along the way there are some great set-pieces as you'd expect from Kurosawa; I particularly liked Sanjuro's attack on the building where the wife is being held hostage.Kurosawa is, as ever, a master of form and the widescreen cinematography looks fantastic. He also elicits great performances from a strong cast, with actors bringing to life the nuances of the scripting. Tatsuya Nakadai really stands out as the slick bad guy but the actors playing the other bizarre and memorable, almost comic-book characters are fine too. All in all, YOJIMBO is an acknowledged classic and for good reason - it's great fun!"
ebiros2,"Dec 23, 2011",N/A,"This is another famous movie made by the Kurosawa - Mifune duo. Kurosawa started deviating from realistic depiction of samurai to more stylized story that's comical at times since he made this movie. The ronin in this movie is also named Sanjuro, but there is no indication that the two are one and the same person.A ronin (Toshiro Mifune) shows up in town where only thriving business seems to be the coffin maker. There are two rival gangs vying for power, and the ronin plays on both of them so they wipe each other out.The acting and setting of the story is very artificial. There is no way people of that period behaved in the manner shown in this movie. But that's Kurosawa's style. You can also see this in his later works such as ""Ran"".There are many funny moments in this movie, and this was the attraction for people going to movies when this movie first came out. It was the golden age of Samurai movies in Japan at the time this movie was made, and many samurai movies from that era were highly stylized and shot gorgeously. Most of them have never been shown outside of Japan (such as ones starring Hashizo Ookawa - another super star from that era). This movie is part of that culture. Only few years after this movie was made that era would come to an abrupt end with people shifting their entertainment to TV, and many movie studios that thrived on making samurai movies will go out of business. Kurosawa himself will find it difficult to make movies.The story borders on preposterous, but Mifune plays the good - bad guy so well that we just can't help enjoying the situation.It's not a movie for everyone, but an interesting movie to watch if you like Kurosawa, or like samurai period pieces."
moritzherz,"Apr 2, 2023",6/10,"As I started watching this movie it felt like watching one of Leone's dollar trilogy movies. It was then as I realized that this movie has influenced the maestro and therefore defined the western genre.You have the hero who can fight very well with his sword, arriving in a town that is terrorized by bandits and they hire him to protect them and kill the bandits. That sounds familiar? Right,, because that is also the story of many westerns, either from Leone or Eastwood himself. But that is not the only thing those movies ""copied"" from Yojinbo. There is the music, that reminded me of the masterclass score from Ennio Morricone, there are the standoffs. Of course with swords, not with pistols and there are the emotions of the characters.In fact, after seeing that Leone heavily took inspiration from Kurosawa, I now understand even more why those movies he created are so good. This again prooves that Kurosawa is one of the top 5 directors of all time."
NoArrow,"Oct 28, 2003",10/10,"In my opinion, Kurosawa's 1961 film ""Yojimbo"" - about a skilled samurai who comes to a town and plays its two gangs against each other - is superior to the (still great) ""Shichinin no Samurai"".  I say this because, for one thing ""Shichinin no Samurai"" is three and a half hours long, which is a little hard to watch if you have to read the whole thing (not Japanese).  Secondly, the choreography of the fight scenes in ""Yojimbo"" is FAR better than the ones in ""Shichinin no Samurai"".  In ""Yojimbo"" the fight scenes are fast and skilled, while in ""Shichinin"" they were more chaotic and hard to watch.  The 1954 movie was still very well done and exciting to watch, don't get me wrong.Anyway, all comparisons aside, ""Yojimbo"" is great work.  The plot is very interesting, and the script shines with much action and dark humor.  I guess I'm in no place to say how good the acting was (not Japanese), but it's sure as hell better then most of the stuff out these days.Another thing worth mentioning is the fight scenes.  Like old westerns, there aren't many, but when they show up they're super cool.  Toshiro Mifune's character - one of the coolest I've seen - is so skilled with that sword.  Its awesome, especially in the scene where he finishes off six guards...by himself.I'd have to say the one thing that kind of ruined it for me was having seen ""Last Man Standing"" (the stupid Hollywood version) beforehand.  I knew what would happen next, and that sucked.  I advise for anyone wanting to see this movie NOT to watch ""Last Man Standing"" first.So, if you're looking for an epic adventure about bravery...watch ""Shichinin no Samurai"", but if you want a dark, edgy, cool tale, rent ""Yojimbo"", now.8.5/10."
CinemaSerf,"Aug 13, 2023",7/10,"I was surprised when I saw this, how late it was set - 19th Century - as I'd always imagined it to be of a more historical nature. That doesn't remotely detract from the story though - as again Kurosawa casts Yoshirô Mifune (""Sanjûrô"") in the leading role. Here he is a wandering samurai who arrives in a village torn by strife. His skills are sought by the two opposing headmen and he quite successfully manages to play them off against each other - and keep the peace - until one the their sons arrives, armed with a pistol, and completely alters the balance of power. Mifune is superb as the maverick, thoroughly honourable and at times quite amusing ronin - I was reminded a little of the characterisation by Clint Eastwood in the Sergio Leone films - with a ruthless, violent streak: but somehow only towards those meritorious of their fate. It takes it's time, this - there is a fair degree of character development and as such, I felt quite invested in both Mifune and in his friend the innkeeper (Eijirô Tôno) as their peril gradually increases. The remainder of the cast adds to the tension well as does the frequent use of the weather in helping create the gripping atmosphere making this a corker of a film, very much worth watching."
sunhee_yongdae_lee,"Oct 26, 2000",9/10,"This movie was really cool!! The samurai's idea of getting rid of the gamblers were excellent!! The story was very manly and also exciting. I liked the intersection of the samurai and the gamblers and fighting in the sand storm.I also liked the main character, nameless samurai.  He acts tough but inside, he fights for the justice and not greedy. If it was one of ""Independence Movie"" stuff, it would be laughable bnut Mifune plays it very realistically. After this movie, there are many heroic characters modeled after him, Han Solo, Indiana Jones, etc, but no one is more realistic and better than the original."
qiowisj,"Nov 20, 2006",8/10,"Kurosawa. What hasn't been said about the man already? Arguebly the greatest director of the 20th century, Yojimbo further solidifies his iconic position. Much like Scorsese and de Niro years later, Kurosawa teams up again with Toshiro Mifune to give us Sanjuro, a cynical ronin who has no qualms about using other people for his own selfish goals.The movie begins with Sanjuro wandering the countryside without purpose. By chance, he walks into a town being torn apart because of two warring criminal clans trying to wipe each other out. Demonstrating his skill at swordmansship, both attempt to hire Sanjuro in their war. But, Sanjuro has his own plans...Mifune's performance is a complete 180 in relation to his role in Seven Samurai. No longer the bumbling buffoon, Mifune displays a cunning and cold-hearted nature which goes a long ways to getting what he wants. The anti-hero portrayal will influence movie characters like Eastwood's The Man with No Name, Han Solo and Snake Plissken for years to come. Hearing the main musical theme and watching the opening shot where the camera follows him from behind makes one realize he is not a man to be trifled with.Yojimbo is a great start to get familiar with Kurosawa. A great story, characters and acting fuse together like few other films."
rooprect,"Sep 12, 2020",9/10,"That's a quote from Kurosawa, if you hadn't already guessed. Here in ""Yojimbo"" (""The Bodyguard"") he shows us exactly what he meant. This film is a real treat for the artsy crowd as well as people who go to the movies just to have fun. It's a technical marvel and layered in its story, and yet there's nothing complicated about it. If you're new to Kurosawa, or art films in general, definitely start here.The story follows our hero, a masterless samurai, who drifts into a bizarre little turf war between 2 rival gangs. The 2 gangs, backed by the ""silk trader"" and the ""sake brewer"", are mostly incompetent yet extremely violent and willing to hire any scoundrel who will fight. Our sly hero sees an opportunity.That's all I'll say about the plot because the rest is for you to discover. It's definitely a fun and exciting ride from start to finish, so fun that you may not realize that you are watching a fantastic work of art. Scenes are meticulously composed, choreographed, lighted, and filmed with such precision that any frame could be a photo to hang on your wall.Let's just take one example, one of the opening scenes. Our hero enters the town and is greeted by barren streets, shuttered windows, and... what's this from afar? A cute little dog in the distance. The camera, situated behind our hero so that we see him in the frame, keeps a tight focus on the little dog as the dog trots closer, and we start to make out something the dog has in his mouth. Closer, closer, always in perfect focus (which was no easy task with a telephoto lens), the dog comes to the foreground and we see the object so clearly that we can make out every detail: a human hand. What a bizarre and darkly comical start.Like the rest of the movie, that scene demonstrates technical wizardry as well as just plain old fun. There's a lot of humor, a lot of action, a lot of suspense, and a LOT of artistic magnificence. Take your pick and watch this film many times."
atomicagepictures,"Oct 3, 2007",10/10,"When I first sat down to watch ""Yojimbo"", I was under the impression that I would end up seeing just another run-of-the-mill unoriginal samurai movie... oh, how naive I was. I sat down with low, low, low low low (I mean, REALLY low) expectations. I left with a smile on my face, realizing I had never been more wrong in my life.""Yojimbo"" tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake... wait, no it doesn't. ""Yojimbo"" shows the conflict between two rival gangs ... no, that's not quite right, either. ""Yojimbo"" is about good vs. evil... no no no.See, no matter how I try to describe ""Yojimbo"", the one-line cannot begin to summarize the film. Here, let me try this: ""Yojimbo"" begins with Sanjuro the Samurai, travelling all by his lonesome, looking to a short wooden stick for a sense of direction. Following the stick's advice, he falls almost directly into a village-wide feud between two rival 'families'. Both families want their counterpart dead; consequently, both families want their hands on the newly arrived Sanjuro. For each of them, he symbolizes definite victory.Sanjuro sees this as an opportunity; not an opportunity to kill, but to make a lot of money. The two families begin to auction for him, and he, of course, plays hard to get. In one of the film's funniest scenes, we watch as the two families meet in the center of town; instead of charging at one another, though, they creep towards the rival army, jabbing, threatening, both far too cowardly to actually attack. Sanjuro sees this too.. he knows at that point that he has them in the palm of his hand.Ah. Even now, after those two paragraphs, I haven't even reached the point of double-triple-quadruple crosses, violence, mercy, action and inaction, captivity, torture, sex, pride -- and lack thereof -- or even retribution. I kid you not, this film has all of them, and more.It is, in it's own beautiful way, a comedy, just as Mifune is, in his own unprecedented way, a comic actor. His performance, full of mischief, mock modesty, and method, is unmatched, even in the most prevailing days of characters like Jack Sparrow.I heard one man call this film a ""classic samurai action pic"", but that is, in the worse way, a terrible generalization. A synonym for 'classic' is 'archetypal', and this film certainly has no archetypes. To say 'samurai action pic' is to give the idea that it is based around heart-pounding sword fights, which it certain is not; that label ignores the film's politics, dark humor, and anti-heroism.I have never seen a movie, and probably never will, quite like ""Yojimbo"", and that includes the Clint Eastwood remake. If you don't like subtitles, or black-and-white cinematography, or physical gags, or scenes that take their time, this is certainly not the film for you. But for me, it was a wonderful 110 minutes well-spent.I feel as if I am rambling now, and perhaps I am. But that's what this movie can do to you, especially if you're not expecting much, and end up with a cinematic gem."
williampsamuel,"Apr 22, 2020",9/10,"A scruffy, mysterious stranger with no name and no past enters a town ruled by feuding gangs. Joining one faction, then the other, he plays the two sides off each other, leading to a violent confrontation in which both are utterly destroyed. And when the dust settles, he gathers the spoils and rides on. No, this isn't a rip-off of Sergio Leone's Fistful of Dollars, this was Leone's inspiration. And as wonderful as 'Dollars' was, Yojimbo is even better.In this movie, Kurosawa isn't trying to be deep or highbrow, he only wants to entertain. On second thought, that's not entirely true. For some time, Kurosawa's critics had derided his work as 'too western,' a charge that I as an American am not qualified to comment on. Well Kurosawa decided to show them just how western he could be, drawing heavily from those most American of genres, the western and the gangster movie. And the results were brilliant. It may not have the grandeur of Seven Samurai, the emotional depth of Ikuru, or the complexity of Rashoman, but what it lacks in these qualities it makes up for in wit, style, and action.Sanjuro (the name the mysterious samurai gives himself) is one of Kurosawa's most interesting characters, despite, or perhaps because, he is among the least realistic. Quite simply, he's too good to be true. He fights like a whirlwind, effortlessly slicing his way through his opponents like the villain in a mad slasher movie, minus the gore. And he's cleverer than any man has a right to be. He strategizes like a chess master, pitting his enemies against each other without their knowledge, so that he can pick off the winner. And if the desired confrontation doesn't materialize, he creates a new plan, finds a new center of leverage to send them clawing at each other again.He's almost reminiscent of Blofeld in From Russia with Love- which brings up the point that he's not exactly the traditional hero. He's no villain; more than once he takes great personal risks to help those in need. But at the same time, he gives no thought to honor, serves no master but himself, and even when he commits the aforementioned kind acts it serves his own ends. Of course he's a saint compared to the bad guys. The crime lords, bandits, and gamblers who run the town are ruthless, double timing cowards, men without any redeeming value, in short, caricatures. But much like a Bond movie, this only adds to the fun. After all, you wouldn't want the audience feeling sorry for them when they're slaughtered.And leaving out believable characters helps turn the drama to comedy, which Yojimbo is, at least in part. Though the visuals are bleak and the bodies pile up at an alarming rate, the chief reaction is one of amusement, even humor. The comical supporting characters of the barkeep and the carpenter don't hurt either, nor do Toshiro Mifune's quips and one-liners. He really does a bang up job of acting here. As incredible as his character is, he really brings him to life, showing wit to rival Roger Moore and a sense of ironic detachment that would make Steve McQueen proud. Clint Eastwood's screen persona surely owes a lot Mifune's work here.Yojimbo is an absolutely wonderful blend of genres and styles that will leave you entertained from beginning to end. It's got laughs, great action, wit and charm aplenty, and all the polish and production values one would expect from a perfectionist like Kurosawa. This may not be his best film, but it's still the kind that most directors only wish they could make. Unless you're one of those poor souls who can't stand to read through a movie, find a copy of Yojimbo. You'll be glad you did."
Dean Routledge,"Feb 17, 1999",N/A,"Personally my favourite Kurosawa movie and obviously one of his more influential works. The story centres itself around a Ronin (Toshiro Mifune), and how he spends his time moving back and forth between two rival gangs in a small village.  I'm sure you know the plot by now (we've all seen ""A Fistful of Dollars""), but the points that really stand out for me are performances and the incredible use of light and shadow by Kurosawa.  The film has some absolute gems as far as classic scenes are concerned.  I mean who has not seen a dog in a movie running down a road with a hand in its mouth?  It's been used a number of times but once again it was Kurosawa who sowed the seed.The film is full of humour, but at the same time carries a certain seriousness, and we get to see the full scope of Mifune's acting ability. The action scenes are as always superb, quite often over before you can visually digest what has happened and they constantly have you reaching for the rewind button.Breathtaking."
akshatmahajan,"May 31, 2025",7/10,"Yojimbo is a samurai classic which grasps you with it's drama, thrill, suspense and action. It blends all the emeotions and provides you with a final product which remains fresh till this date.The story though slow, was good and innovative for that time; the screenplay was decent due to uneven pacing due to which movie demands your patience; the direction was good and the performances were also good. The action scenes were also good and the emotions were also nicely blended, having a good inpact on the audience.Overall, it was a good movie which you should definitely give a watch. Now, going for it's sequel!"
NEFARlOUS,"Oct 19, 1998",10/10,"Yojimbo (the bodyguard) is set approximately two hundred years ago in Japan, during a time of chaos. The film starts with the central character, a Ronin (landless Samurai)at a crossroads. He squats down and spins a bottle. When it stops, he takes the direction indicated. There is a town at war. Two rival factions, each owning factories of some description, have hired mercenaries and criminals and are busy attempting to wipe each other out whilst the ordinary villagers are caught in the middle. The Ronin finds this amusing and starts to play both sides against the middle, first demonstrating his skill by killing a number of mercenaries (Cooper...three coffins *pause* *look* maybe four.....) and accepting one rival's bid and then leaving and accepting the other, leaving also a trail of uncertainty and worry in his wake. The Ronin is unshaven, unwashed and very, very skillful - a shark among minnows. He is also sardonic, sarcastic and gives the appearance of caring nothing. But from time to time, a glimmer of honour and belief shines, albeit briefly before being covered up once more. I won't go into more specific detail about this film lest I ruin it for those that have yet to see it. The director is Akira Kurasawa, the main actor Toshiiro Mifune, two of the best reasons for seeing this film. It was subsequently remade by Morricone as ""a fistful of dollars"". His initial claim that he was remaking Fellini's ""a servant of two masters"" held water for precisely two seconds. It has more recently been remade as ""last man standing"" - both films shallow copies of the original. See it - tape it - buy it.Dan"
fciocca,"Apr 5, 2023",7/10,"""Yojimbo"" is a cool movie for its intense plot: a Samurai ends up in a small town where there is a fight between two big gangs that is putting its inhabitants in serious danger. The most interesting part is to see how the protagonist develops a plan to outsmart these criminals. The interaction between him and the tavern keeper feels friendly and it is almost like the innkeeper is in a way the representation of the audience. It is like the samurai is explaining his strategy to us directly. There is a good balance between dialogues and intense fighting scenes. The photography is stunning, I liked how the director used the lights and the shadow. With simple but effective techniques, he put together an amazing photography that highlights the tension. The editing is always on point and the motion picture has a wonderful rhythm that kept me glued to the screen.This film took many simple ideas, mixed them together in a truly original way, and this for me is the true secret of its success. There is no need to over complicate your plot with incredibly structured narrative arcs that most probably will end up nowhere. The almost two hour length flew away. I believe this is a classic that you should watch."
gftbiloxi,"Apr 1, 2005",10/10,"Although it lacks the scope of THE SEVEN SAMURAI, THRONE OF BLOOD, and other more widely known films by the celebrated Akira Kurosawa, the 1961 YOJIMBO (also known as BODYGUARD) is one of the most important films of the second half of the 20th Century--and a film that was deeply influenced by American film. Even so, YOJIMBO stands on its own merits: it's a magnificent piece of cinema that will fascinate even those who normally turn up their noses at ""movies with subtitles."" In theory, the film is based on the 1929 Dashiell Hammett novel RED HARVEST--but transports the basic story to a period in Japan when the Samurai class has fallen on hard times and must seek employment as common body guards. Sanjuro Kuwabatake (brilliantly played by Toshiro Mifune, who appeared in several Kurosawa films) is such a one, a scruffy looking and aging warrior who finds himself caught between warring factions of a Japanese village and responds by playing the two against each other.One of the film's greatest assets is its visual style. Kurosawa is very clearly influenced by the look of the American western here, and most particularly so, in my opinion, by HIGH NOON. Consequently, YOJIMBO leaps the cultural divide with considerable ease--but Kurosawa uses the images of empty streets and the lone warrior to considerably different effect, presenting him as a dangerous figure who emerges from the dust and the wind to rip wide his foes. But the film does not rely on visual style alone: there is plenty of hard substance here, too. The plot is tightly wound, action-intensive, and laced with a dry and very black humor, and the cast is superlative throughout.As it borrowed from the American movie western, so did it influence American film in return, most obviously in the form of the popular Clint Eastwood ""spaghetti westerns"" of the 1970s--where it was essentially remade as A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS. But frankly Clint Eastwood never had it so good: with Kurosawa at the helm and Mifune as the lead, Eastwood's ""lone stranger"" feels mighty tame in comparison.The Criterion DVD offers the film in original widescreen and in the best possible condition short of a full digital restoration. As noted elsewhere, there are occasional blips and lines--but honestly the film is so driving that you will barely notice them. The subtitles also seem to be a better translation than I've seen in any other version. YOJIMBO was my introduction to Japanese cinema. I urge you to let it be yours as well.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon reviewer"
ElMaruecan82,"Jan 10, 2019",10/10,"Wandering in a desolated pre-Meiji Japan, a samurai entrusts a piece of wood thrown in the air to guide him once it hits the ground.He finds himself in a town where two clans fight over political and economical control: there's Seibei, a ruler dependent on the silk commerce and his domineering wife's judgment, and the greedier Ushitora, in the sake brewing business, who wants his share on the silk. ""The Godfather"" had five families, in ""Yojimbo"" we get only two, it's more economical but still calls for the same Machiavellian skills Michael Corleone demonstrated, he who learned ""to think as the people around. and on that basis, anything is possible"".The rivalry is exposed like a chess game where the Samurai moves the pieces. It means there's more time for thought than action and action must be quick and efficient. Inertia is a power never to be underestimated, being strong from a misleading passiveness. Look at Mifune in his first scenes, moving his shoulders, scratching his cheek. I read Kurosawa told Mifune to play his Samurai like an errand dog, maybe that explains the next startling shot of the dog trotting over the main street with a hand in his mouth, maybe it's only a matter of time before the Samurai starts the biting.And when the thinking stops, a few shots of sake helping, he says ""I'll get paid for killing, and this town is full of people who deserve to die."" There's profit for him and peace for innocent villagers, it's a fair trade meaning every move has to be carefully prepared. So when he's taunted by three Ushitora's thugs, he knows he's being observed after having been the observer for a long expositional sequence, he's got to prove he means business. He kills two and chops one's arm, then order two coffins to the undertaker before retracting himself and asking for two, a scene reprised in Sergio Leone's remake ""A Firstful of Dollars"".This is ""Yojimbo"" character-establishing moment, from that point, each Family will want to hire him as bodyguard (the title's meaning). Unbeknownst to them, he'll work for both sides and for neither and he's far a better poker-player than sword-wielder, which is saying a lot. And these poker/chess games exemplify something remarkable in Kurosawa's filmmaking, his films are rooted in the present, whether in dilatation or acceleration. Think of ""Rashomon"" where the same scene is repeated over and over to accentuate the changes of body languages and emotions in each version, in ""Ikiru"", the present is the only thing a man can hook his life to and so does it in ""Yojinbo"".Even the name given by the Samurai: Kuwabatake Sanjuro is a throwaway alias inspired by the mulberry fields he was just seeing. Like Eastwood, Mifune has no name because a name has a past and he's a man of the present. And Kurosawa's directing is the embodiment of Sanjoru's skills, it's a total control of every moment, a slow ballet between inertia and movement, observation and action. Look at how messy and awkward the fights are until Sanjuro intervenes, and the fight is over as soon as it begun.The violent moments make for less than a minute in the whole film and the reason why they go so quick is because Kurosawa wants us to focus on something else. When Sanjuro's betrayal is exposed, an immediate ellipse shows him at an inch of life, no need to see the beating, the story must go on, but when he's beaten again by Kannuki the giant, the fight serves a purpose. To focus in ""Yojimbo"" is to try to give every detail a purpose.And this is why many scenes show characters in viewing position: the most emblematic one is Sanjuro amusingly watching from above the two clans getting ready to fight before it's cancelled by the arrival of a government official, a ""bugyo"" (a small role for Takashi Shimura). Later, a long close-up on Sanjuro's disfigured face reveals in the next shot the key to an escape he had just spotted. And that's the key literally with the film, the more you focus, the more you find. Sanjuro understands Ushitora is planning a murder to make the bugyo leave the town, he knows this is an innocent death he won't prevent. Hiding behind a stoic façade some self-loathing feelings, he moves forward by bargaining the price of his collaboration and asking for more sake. That's a subtle detail in Mifune's body language I couldn't see the first time.There are so many areas to praise I wouldn't know where to begin, it's extraordinary how a movie that feels so effortless became so influential, showing for the first time bad guys against other bad guys, and Mifune giving quite an underrated performance as an antihero who redeems himself a little when he loses a few battles, meeting his match in Ushi-Tori's brother, Usonoke, the young and handsome Tatsuya Nakadai who proudly harbors a gun, the only element that added more unpredictability. At the end, there's one moment where Sanjuro doesn't keep his guard up as if he was ready to die like a Samurai or or because you can't cheat death so many times without giving it a free shot.Maybe that's why the present is so present, it's haunted by the fear of death; maybe the common denominator of Kurosawa's movies, the Damocles sword that force characters to move forward. That might also explain why the soundtrack is so incongruously modern, unlike the pompous gravity of epic scores, Kurosawa dares the synthetic sound and even sometimes pop music, allowing the film to free itself from genre conventions, foreshadowing the indispensability of music in the Western genre, thanks to a maestro named Morricone.Kurosawa trusted his instinct with a Samurai flair, he didn't just make movies, he defied conventions and became a perpetual re-inventor, or the true Sensei of modern cinema."

bob the moo,"Jul 28, 2008",N/A,"By chance a wandering samurai enters a small village where gambling and gangs have replaced the tenants of normal village life. Gang-lords Ushi-Tora and Seibei occupy either end of the community, each with a small army of hired fighters. The bitter standoff that exists as a result has turned the village into a desolate place - well, except for the undertaker, for whom business is very good indeed. After a short time observing these things, the samurai decides on the best way to use his skills at killing to remove the two gangs and return the village to normality.It is really too easy to get home in the evenings and play a film that requires no attention and very little work and, as a result, there are several subtitled films that I have recorded and/or bought that sit unwatched long after purchase. However recently I have been using my LoveFilm to make more of an effort to watch films that really I should be more familiar with and at the moment that is meaning catching up on some key films from Akira Kurosawa. I make this sound like work but actually it is good for me to focus wholly on any film but also the quality thus far has been high.Yojimbo, like Seven Samurai, will be familiar to many viewers without even watching it simply because of the amount of references and remakes it has since influenced. The remakes range from the good to the terrible (and those that think that Last Man Standing is the worst remake ever should watch Van Damme's Coyote Moon or (even worse) Albert Pyun's Omega Doom), but without a doubt Yojimbo itself manages to stand at the head of the crowded pack. There is still a misconception though that somehow because it is ""foreign"" and ""black and white"" that it will be a heavier film without the action or entertainment value of remakes such as Fistful of Dollars, but, as stated, this is a misconception. On the contrary, Yojimbo feels slick and fresh 40+ years later and provides the viewer with much to enjoy and few weaknesses as it goes.Clearly influenced himself by American westerns, Kurosawa delivers a film that is cool, funny and dramatic - with all parts working well together and none dominating the others. He shoots it with such a good eye (with cinematographer Miyagawa) and very little visual clutter (either things or style) that the viewer cannot help feel impressed by how striking the samurai looks in the middle of the film but he never lets this style take away anything. With the exaggerated villains and side characters, the film is much more comic than I expected and it is more enjoyable for it as it also then helps us be in the mindset of the samurai (to a point) by seeing it as a bit of a game - an aspect that the dry and serious tone of Last Man Standing did not have and cost it dearly as a film. It is not anything to have you rolling with laughter but it is funny. Importantly though it doesn't detract from it as an engaging game of a story and it does have plenty of action and drama as the samurai plays out his plan.In the middle of all this it would be deeply unfair not to credit the importance of Mifune in the film's success. That the character looks easy is down to him because his presence and air of cool scheming compliments and is complimented by the overall style of the film. He delivers his lines with a certain amount of cockiness, but not ever enough to be arrogant, and his body language and screen presence make him instantly engaging. He is well supported though by plenty of actors doing good work to be comic characters but also still be useful as dramatic devices (ie the villains still offer a threat even if they are quite funny); Sazanka, Kawazu, Tono, Sawamura, Watanabe etc are all good even if they do stand in the shadow of Mifune. Nakadai's Unosuke (the gunslinger) doesn't get enough credit in my opinion. To me he was important because he conveys a cool sense of menace similar to the samurai's but yet also ensures it is always mean rather than clever, brash rather than precise and based on the gun he carries rather than anything about him as a man (which is how Mifune comes across).Yojimbo has countless remakes out there for you to check out - some good, some bad, but the original stands up strong in the pack. Without any real weakness the film is almost effortless in being cool, funny, engaging and entertaining. It is worth noting that everything looks easy - the performances, the blend of comedy/drama/style, the story, they all work together so naturally that one assumes that it just happened whereas of course it is down to those involved in the making and delivery. This is a great film that is fresh, cool and entertaining and deserves to be seen by anyone who has ever seen a remake or a film which it has influenced (which is a lot of people!)."
frankde-jong,"Jul 3, 2025",7/10,"""Yojimbo"" (1961) was the second film I saw in the Kurosawa retrospective after ""Seven Samurai"" (1954).Both films are about Ronin, which are samurai without a master that are for hire.In ""Yojimbo"" (meaning ""bodyguard"") this is illustrated very well in the opening scene. Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune) has no job and walks aimlessly on the road. He throws a tree branch into the air and walks in the direction the tree branch indicates when it hits the ground. Thus doing he arrives in a town terrorized by two rivaling gangs.Both with respect to ""Seven Samurai"" and ""Yojimbo"" Kurosawa was influenced by the West and influenced the West on his turn. ""Yojimbo"" was inspired by the novel ""Red harvest"" (1929, Dashiell Hammett) and inspired ""A fistful of dollars"" (1964, Sergio Leone) on his turn. In effect ""Yojimbo"" laid the foundation for what later came to be known as the Spaghetti Western.In ""Seven Samurai"" the samurai provide their services to their client for a very reasonable price (room and food). The main character in ""Yojimbo"" is much more cynical. He provides no service whatsoever at big costs. In effect he plays the rival gangs off against each other.Both films do have strong visuals. The mystical forrest in ""Seven Samurai"" and the deserted main street (all the villagers live in fear of the gangs) in ""Yojimbo"". Personally I liked the visuals of ""Seven samurai"" better. ""Yojimbo"" did very well at the box office (both in Japan and abroad) but although ""Yojimbo"" is not bad at all I think Kurosawa made better movies."
Escapist-2802,"Apr 11, 2023",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's classic samurai film is a masterwork and a major cultural touchstone. Toshiro Mifune appears as a charismatic ronin who arrives in a village controlled by rival criminal groups and schemes to turn the tables on them. The film's funny language, interesting characters, and breathtaking action sequences create a seamless blend of comedy and cruelty. Tatsuya Nakadai, as Mifune's armed adversary, gives an excellent performance as well. Many additional movies have been influenced by Yojimbo, including Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. One of Kurosawa's finest works, and among the greatest movies of all time. Fans of samurai films, as well as those who appreciate a well-told, exciting tale, won't want to miss this."
InjunNose,"Dec 8, 2019",7/10,"As Kurosawa films go, this one is not my favorite. It's no ""Rashomon"" and I think a little too much has been made of some of the individual performances, which are workmanlike at best--particularly Toshiro Mifune's as the title character. Essentially Dashiell Hammett's ""Red Harvest"" set in nineteenth-century Japan (with elements of two other Hammett novels, ""The Maltese Falcon"" and ""The Glass Key,"" thrown in for good measure), ""Yojimbo"" functions as a whole rather than as a series of parts. Even Tatsuya Nakadai's celebrated turn as the pistol-toting punk is something that really only works in the context of the movie; I wouldn't point to it as one of the most brilliant cinematic performances of all time. (Nakadai's finest moment under Kurosawa's direction was in ""Kagemusha."")I don't mean to say that ""Yojimbo"" isn't interesting or entertaining. There are some things I really like about it: Masaru Sato's perversely jaunty score, the uneasy atmosphere of physical and moral decay (accentuated by the stark late autumn setting), Mifune's world-weary ronin being profoundly embarrassed by his own decision to do a good deed. But this is a very, VERY talky film; Kurosawa could have shaved a good half-hour off the dialogue without any loss of effect or coherence. All the physical action--every sword slice, severed arm and spurt of blood--adds up to perhaps sixty seconds, which is odd for a movie based on the rip-roaringly violent ""Red Harvest."" It's a good film, but it could have been a great one."
lahninanwar-55528,"Dec 26, 2022",10/10,"As the progenitor of Leone's A Fistful of Dollars, it's kind of sad to say that this movie is better in every way, from Cinematography perfectly capturing feudal Japan, to the totally different yet equally evocative scoring, and maybe most of all Mifune's towering swagger as the lead, everything here is perfection.Now pacing wise Asian cinema is harder and slower getting into then American and also European, but for fans of Leone and westerns in general this IMO is required watching for film buffs and along with lots of early 60's stuff studied in film classes. And all this, I didn't even mention Kurowasa's masterful direction that unfolds it all with a slow assured hand, that parallels Bergman in a certain descent."
malkane316,"May 15, 2004",8/10,"another quick review: Is Mifune better than De Niro, Pacino, Brando and the rest? Here he outshines all of Clint's performances in the movies this one influenced, with his one liners, and physical presence. Admittedly, the rest of the cast are not called on to do much, but both sides show themselves as desperate, and naïve. The violence, and set pieces are subtle yet memorable, but it is Mifune's performance which carries the film. some memorable scenes, aside from the fights, are the dog with someone's hand running through town, and Mifune's exit-his wok complete. 8 out of ten"
HardKnockLife210,"Jun 21, 2004",8/10,"""Yojimbo"" is the kind of movie you see on the Top 250, and think how the heck something with a title like that and something that the majority of the world's population has not heard of could make the list.  It is only after watching it that you can understand the reasons.First of all, ""Yojimbo"" has great acting.  I know none of the actors' names, but I felt that every character was in character and believable.  Second, the story is great.  How the suspense builds and and how the action occurs just adds to the enjoyment of watching the film.  The ending is also great, and the bits of comedy added make it all the more delightful.  The best part of the movie, however, was the characterization.  Sanjuro's character is an amazingly deep hero who develops throughout the movie, and the other characters, although not focused on, seem to do the same.Really, I can't find too much negative here.  The fact that the movie was made in another nation over forty years ago keep it from having its deepest impact on me.  But overall, this film is EXCELLENT.Final Grade: A."
wortwart,"Oct 17, 2002",9/10,"The man with the wildest eye-rolling on earth, Toshiro Mifune, acts rather cool in this samurai western. Did you ever want to know where Clint Eastwood's cigar in the corner of the mouth stems from? Where Sergio Leone took all the sandy desert wind as background of the lonesome hero, facing a violent crowd? Where the nameless heroes had their debut, cynical, silent saints and killers in an evil world where only the victims deserve sympathy? A fine, twisted plot (sometimes confused ... or did a few scenes miss in the rotten copy I saw?) keeps the suspense until the showdown. Not Kurosawa's most intelligent movie, but really entertaining and brilliantly filmed. 9/10"
angeliecajurao,"Aug 4, 2024",10/10,This is a movie unmatched in all it's aspects knowing that can be considered classical. Robin is a great character in helping peasants and can be idolised by young men who loves action and mystery movies. As a woman I love learning martial arts skills and this movie inspired me to start learning so that no one can just bully me. Though I don't like chaos and fighting it's just what the story inspired me to stand on the side of the less privileged. Keep doing movies like this to give credit to the Japanese culture and help us learn their unique culture and apply the positive aspect of this movie in our daily life.
anton-6,"Jun 20, 2001",10/10,The coolest and best hero ever Toshiro Mifune is playing the leading role in this classic western film.Inspired A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS  and the last remade was Last Man Standing.Perfect played by my favorite action actor Toshiro Mifune and directed by the master director Akira Kurosawa. one of the greatest action films ever made.5/5
JSVoid,"Apr 7, 2020",9/10,"This samurai film is the staple for the american western genre, introducing the idea of a wonderfully silent ghost town with a wonderfully skilled traveler roaming its streets. The standoff scenes were also very iconic and carried onto the western genre later on with the Clint Eastwood films, and many others.Akira Kurosawa's style is accentuated very well in this piece, with his telescopic wide shots, tight lenses and gorgeous framing.The only flaw I could see is the sometime over-usage of humor through some of the characters stupidity, but this is a staple for any Kurosawa film anyway, and isn't new to his films.One of the best and maybe the most iconic samurai films is worth the hype, and the analysis. Yojimbo is amazing."
aciessi,"Oct 10, 2015",7/10,"You've just sat down to watch a film by Akira Kurosawa. Make sure you're not squeamish by the sight of decapitated limbs and swords smashing into samurais. Kurosawa is the original master of the violent Japanese samurai flick. I wouldn't be surprised if Quentin Tarantino gets down on his knees and prays to him by his bedside at night. This genre of film that he created is based upon the period of ""Jidaigeki"", which has its origins in Kabuki theater. It's the music of the swords. It's the story of brave samurais fighting in honor of their families and towns. It might sound foreign to you, but it's really not. ""Jidaigeki"" genre movies supplied many concepts and ideas that inspired what we all know as the Spaghetti Western. Well, you should know, it was a little too inspired, but that's a story to get into another day. Kurosawa's films have an amazing shelf life to cinephiles across the globe, and none more important than ""Rashoman"". But I have just watched, what I feel to be the best example of Kurosawa's influence on the western genre, and what I feel to be an especially compelling and entertaining piece of work, ""Yujimbo"".""Yojimbo"" has a story, not that complicated, and told so many times, you'd think you've sat down to watch some clichéd schlock. As I've stated before, it's about the lone hero, or in this case, the lone samurai, who somewhere along his travels comes upon a village that has been split between two rival gangs. In the town are the struggling families and business owners that are victimized day in and day out by the constant robberies and assaults from the gangs, as well the insufferable and corrupt police officer that gleefully capitulates to the two rival gangs. They ravage throughout the town, and out of sympathy for the townspeople, or perhaps just for the hell of it, the lone samurai decides to pit the two against each other in order for them to fight to death. It is out of his virtue to save the town from the hands of crime, and he's well aware of it very early on in the film, as he notices a dog carrying a severed human hand around the town. This is the Wild West, or shall we say, the wild east. In this little town, the lone samurai helps cause chaos and showdowns abound as the rival gangs fight for territory. It's almost comedic how much manipulation he has over them. I loved how it didn't always work out. For instance, the lone samurai is seen overhearing a conversation of the hotel owners planning to kill him in order to not pay for his stay. It seems like he's been causing a lot of trouble, much to the chagrin of the town's people.I really enjoyed the balance between action, story and humor. Unlike ""Rashoman"" that captivates with a rigid, dramatic story with a lot of unsightly, gruesome characters trying to eat each other alive, this is a fun little western. It's a classic in the genre as it gets. The lone samurai even bears a strange resemblance his American counterpart, Clint Eastwood, complete with his squinty eyes and scowl. The man in question is Toshiro Mifune, and he has a spectacular track record with Akira Kurosawa. Every time he collaborates with him, you're going to get an unbelievable performance. In ""Rashoman"" he was the insane, giggling bandit, and here, he's the silent, master of the sword, who could cut your arm off with a single blow. He's the original badass movie star. Even when he goes down, he goes down hard. When the lone samurai gets captured towards the end of the film, he is seen slowly and painfully making his mistake. This probably was my favorite scene, for it demonstrates Mifune's range as an actor, and his willingness to discomfort himself for the benefit of the story.The picture also has a really unique soundtrack. I overheard someone in the audience chuckling about it, for it sounded a little similar to ""Big Band"". The music fits the attitude of the picture splendidly. It's a big, loud soundtrack to a big story. The cinematography was also very ambitious for it's time, and Kurosawa's main cinematographer, Kazuo Miyagawa, noticeably builds upon his great talent of the image since Rashoman. The battle sequences are sweeping and detailed with all the blood and guts intact. The spectacular scene in which the lone samurai is escaping is staged and shot beautifully. Miyagawa holds an exceptional gift of bringing the Edo Japanese era vibrantly to life.""Yojimbo"" is a violent epic, and one of Kurosawa's most startlingly good achievements. It's entertaining, thrilling and a credit to the history of Japanese cinema."
Fritz-the-Cat,"May 1, 2003",10/10,"Well, I can definitely see why this movie caused a huge cultural influence in America. Yojimbo is nothing short of an incredible action movie that never gets boring and never lets up. Some of the parts of this movie compare so well to modern action films that I actually thought this movie ranks in my top 10 action movies of all time.Like ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly,"" Yojimbo is an opera of cheesiness. The acting is good in a loud way, and there are certain characters that have no place in reality, but a welcome home in the world of movies. (That huge, ugly bastard.) Toshiro Mifune has consistently been a commanding prescence on the screen in every Kurosawa film that I have seen, and each performance I watch makes me love him more and more. In this film, he plays a gruffy old samurai, but with a different edge than that of Sanjuro. In Sanjuro, the lead character is more of an unconventional leader, using cleverness as his main weapon, and the sword only when necessary. This is still the same sort of character that he plays in Yojimbo, however, in this film he has a much more brutal air about him. Sanjuro left you feeling like he was a restrained individual. Yojimbo left you feeling a little awed by the sheer power that he could unleash.As far as the plot goes, this movie is about as perfect as you can get to suit my needs. Basically, a man who calls himself Sanjuro comes into town for a few days. When he leaves, everyone is dead. What's not to love? But seriously... This movie is about a town that is torn by two rival gangs. When the no-named Samurai comes in, he manages to use his skillful swordplay to manipulate the two sides so they destroy each other. And in the end, everyone dies!! Glee! Glee!This film was so thoroughly fun and funny that I was laughing the entire length of the movie. The final showdown was so incredible and different from any sort of action climax I have seen that it made a serious mark in my brain. When I was watching it, I got a vibe that I had seen this level of bad assness in another movie before, but I couldn't really remember where. What made it so good was the entire development of all the characters. I love that feeling where the bad guys are set up so much that you just love to watch them get their asses kicked.Toshirio Mifune's character of ""the man with no name"" is definitely the best part of the film. He has the dark humor and stage prescence to really pull this role off and make it work to a maximum. I also found the way that he gets his ""name"" to be a wonderful touch to the movie as well. He says his name is ""Sanjuro,"" which means he is 30 years old. He then looks out into the distance and sees a mulberry field. ""Sanjuro Kuwabatake,"" he says. Kuwabatake means mulberry field in Japanese.There are so many great little touches to this movie that are so classic in and of themselves. In the beginning of the film, Sanjuro throws a stick into the air. The stick points a direction, so, Sanjuro walks that direction. Truly a man with no purpose for living. This, among many other moments, make the movie so fun and fresh that you never get bored while watching.The GOODS: Fun, inventive, and downright ass-kicking. I am definitely taking a shine to black and white movies. Since I was raised with color, I used to prefer movies that are in color. After seeing Kurosawa use the black and white as an entirely different medium of putting film onto the screen, utilizing the actual lack of color, I have been gaining an entirely different respect for black and white. Yojimbo is a black and white film, which drains the color from the film and replaces it with a dusty feeling, like a western. I think Yojimbo would not have been the same movie if it had been in color.The BADS: Yojimbo, much like ""The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly,"" is filled with cheese. It is a fantastic film in the sense that it is borderline fantasy. I do not really look at this to be a bad thing, but there are cerain audiences who don't enjoy watching cheese on film.The overall story pretty much stands: If you like a good adventure story, and you like to be entertained, go see Yojimbo. I found it to be engaging and never boring. This movie zoomed to my alltime favorites list, being a perfectly crafted, fast paced, fun adventure that will only leave you feeling giddy and wishing that YOU were a nameless samurai. Hands down 4 stars."
bunny888,"Oct 4, 2002",10/10,"This is simply my favorite of the Kirusawa-Mifune collaborations.  If you're going to watch ""A Fistful of Dollars"" at any point, i suggest watching it first, then ""YOJIMBO"".  ""FoD"" is a very good movie, too, but this is so much better, it will pale in comparison.  (no pun intended)"
Decath,"Oct 25, 1999",10/10,"I liked this movie much better than the two remakes - the one with Clint Eastwood, and the newer one with Bruce Willis.  If you liked this one at all, you should check out Sanjuro - also by Akira Kurosawa.   They are both old and both subtitled, but the swordplay and customs are very historically accurate."
Diego_rjc,"Apr 29, 2010",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa is probably the most famous Japanese director of all time. Even a person that doesn't study cinema, she probably have watched a Kurosawa flick or at least heard of him. But this doesn't happen just for any reason. In his career, there are all-time classics, such as 'Ran', 'Dreams', 'Rashomon', 'Kagemusha' and many others. Most of his movies, specially his early ones, such as 1957's 'Seven Samurai', introduced many concepts that are used in Hollywood nowadays, specially in action movies. Another picture quite important for Kurosawa's career and the movie industry in general is 'Yojimbo', from 1961. This movie is widely considered as one of Kurosawa's best pictures. If not his best.'Yojimbo's story is set in the late-19th century. It tells the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune), a samurai without a master, that drifts without any specific destination. He arrives in a small village, dominated by two lords: Seibei (Seizaburô Kawazu), who produces silk, and Ushitora (Kyû Sazanka), who produces sake. Those two lords are always fighting each other, but they are both and his men to coward to make one real fight, so they just threat each other. Upon his arrival, the samurai realizes this, so he offer the services of bodyguard to both of them (thus the title, Yojimbo, which means bodyguard in Japanese). But all Sanjuro really wants is to make the fight come to an end and finally bring peace to the small town. The movie's screenplay was wrote by Kurosawa himself, with the help of Ryûzô Kikushima. It is loosely based on several stories, such as the novel 'Red harvest'. 'Yojimbo's plot may seem somewhat familiar, and that's because this story was revisited by many other directors over the years. But the screenplay is just the one problem I have with 'Yojimbo'. Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and the story, just though it could be better developed, specially on the character's department. It would be nice to know some of the background story of how the town reached that situation. This would help to explain the actions of some characters, that seem somewhat shallow. But the screenplay also manages to deal with excellent subjects in a subtle way, such as the generation conflicts, innocence, cowardly, etc. Another thing that worked very well is that you really don't know what happened to Sanjuro before the events depicted on the movie. The picture already starts with him wandering in a deserted road. This happens to increase the mysteries around his character, which are never really explained. In a nutshell, a very well-written screenplay.Guess who's the leading actor in 'Yojimbo'? If you guessed Toshirô Mifune, then you are absolutely right. After all, it would be the obvious answer, because Mifune made nothing less than sixteen movies along with Akira Kurosawa. and this movie marks the twelfth collaboration between the two. And one of the best, not only because of the movie itself, which is great, but specially for Mifune's work. He had already delivered excellent performances in other Kurosawa's pictures, such as 'Seven Samurai' or 'Rashomon', but his job in 'Yojimbo' really stands out. Mifune was perfect in his role as Sanjuro. He understood the part do well that you actually believes he is the samurai. And in the scene where he is drunk is like an interpretation class for new actors. Amazing. The rest of the cast was nice also. Of course no one reached Mifune's greatness, but there wasn't one bad actor in the main or in the supporting cast.Normally in my reviews here on IMDb, this is the paragraph where I say what I tough about the direction of the movie. But there isn't much to comment on Kurosawa's directing job in 'Yojimbo'. That's because it's Kurosawa, what can I say? Everyone knows that Kurosawa is a master, the best of the best, the guy who created all the concepts we use in action movies, so I'm gonna restrict to saying this: as always, Kurosawa makes a perfect job. His direction was so great that only three years after the release of 'Yojimbo', in 1964, one of the best Italian directors of all time, Sergio Leone, made a shot-by-shot remake of the movie. But Leone's picture was set in the American Wild West, and was starred by no one less then Clint Eastwood. Leone's 'A Fistful of Dollars' is a movie as good as 'Yojimbo', and all thanks to Kurosawa. Another thing that I though it was great in 'Yojimbo' is the Soundtrack. A brilliant work by Masaru Satô. Aside from the Soundtrack, other aspect in 'Yojimbo' that really stands out is the cinematography. A beautiful work in black-and- white tones by Kazuo Miyagawa.Overral, 'Yojimbo' is one of those movies that come close to perfection. The only complain I have with it is the script, that could have been better developed in the characters' department. But this doesn't remove the glow of the movie, that has a perfect direction and an excellent acting, specially by Toshiro Mifune, in his twelfth collaboration with Akira Kurosawa, that made Yojimbo one of his best pictures. If not the best.10/10"
cookies5,"Dec 26, 2002",N/A,"Exchange the swords for six-shooters and the Japanese clothing for jeans, boots and shirts, and you have The Perfect Western!  A ""Nameless Man"" wanders into town, a town split by two gangs, and since he is a man with certain talents for fighting, both gangs want to hire him.  I did find some hiccups in the translation from Japanese to English; the gangs were referred to as ""gamblers"" and the coffin-maker was called a ""cooper""--a barrel maker. I don't know if this is the original translation or if it was changed when they remastered the film.  The film rolls along at a good clip, without much lagging.  It isn't constant action, it does take time to set up some characterization.  Which is good: I hate films that treats all the actors like props.  ""A Fist Full Of Dollars"" is almost a direct copy of this movie, except for one thing: ""Yojimbo"" has a sense of humor.  There are plenty of lighter scenes that either make you laugh out loud, or at least chuckle. There is one picky point: I wish someone would have taken the tag out of ""Nameless Man's"" costume.  The poor man spent the whole movie struggling with his costume, trying to make it stop itching him.  Otherwise, it is a Must-See for those who are studying the Western Genere', for it inspired a change in that genere'."
krational66,"Apr 30, 2020",7/10,"Carrying his shoulders and shrugging his waist, Mifune Toshihiro is the most unique man in the film. Penniless, Xianyun Yehe, leisurely complacent.The chivalrous man drenched in Confucian culture really has its own style. They despise the glory and honor of the glory and wealth, and hate those who are rich and benevolent, and those who are not officials, almost want to shovel out later; what they really pursue is the road that is bound to be hidden. Speaking of which, they seemed to be fighting with Taoism's free and easy.The lonely heroes described by Raymond Chandler are often private detectives, cynical, and often complaining about society, and they do not really show the spirit of independence in the past. For example, although Marlow is very humorous, he is often slightly bitter. It can be seen in the inner depression.In contrast, the samurai in Kurosawa 's film are more optimistic and open-minded, like Tsubakiro 's tongue spit out when he hears the conspiracy of the boss lady, or he still does n't forget his idea to guilty of hail when he dies Heroic. He is a man who calmly accepts this dark world, but he will not hesitate to help when encountering injustice.Such as the clear flowing water, no matter the high mountains and lowlands, my generation is happy."
dee.reid,"Dec 25, 2005",10/10,"""Yojimbo"" is one of the coolest samurai flicks from the one and only Akira Kurosawa and it's also starring Japanese acting legend Toshiro Mifune as a wandering ronin who plays two warring gangster fashions against one another. ""Yojimbo"" is my Christmas present and my introduction to the mind of Japanese wonder-kind Kurosawa, who injects enough black humor and violence into the picture to make it a one-of-a-kind viewing experience. The West has gotten a translated taste of Kurosawa from ""A Few Dollars More"" (1964) with Clint Eastwood and director Sergio Leone. Ironically enough, ""Yojimbo"" was Kurosawa's take on the western genre, and so it's no wonder Leone got his hands on it.10/10"
DLochner,"Mar 11, 2024",7/10,"The film is heavily influenced by the Western genre, particularly by films like ""A Fistful of Dollars"" by Sergio Leone. In fact, ""Yojimbo"" has often been described as the Japanese version of a Western, as it shares many similar elements, such as the lone stranger who arrives in a town full of conflict and decides to manipulate the situation to his advantage.It can be considered an action film, but it offers more than just pure action. While the film includes some impressive fight scenes typical of the samurai genre, it also focuses heavily on character development, building tension, and social commentary. The action often serves to drive the plot forward and amplify the film's themes rather than being an end in itself. Therefore, one could say that ""Yojimbo"" is a blend of action, drama, and social critique, making it a multifaceted and captivating film.Incredibly unusual is the film's music, with its discordant sounds and striking tones. But it's interesting and effective. While the later remixes are arguably better action films, this film is more of a social study."
MovieAddict2016,"Nov 23, 2005",10/10,"The film opens with Toshirô Mifune navigating through a corn field. Slowly he is revealed to us and even his walk seems very self-confident and tough.Text on-screen informs us he is a Japanese ronin - now without a master due to Japanese civil war, he has turned into a bounty hunter and roams the countryside.Soon he wanders into a town and gets a job as a bodyguard. And then he hatches a brilliant idea to play two towns against each other for his own advantage.""Yojimbo"" is one of Akira Kurosawa's most popular films to arrive in the States, and only a couple years after its release (which was extremely successful in Japan) ""spaghetti western"" director Sergio Leone remade the film (without credit to Kurosawa) as ""For a Few Dollars More,"" the second film in the well-regarded ""Dollars"" trilogy.Both films are very good (you can find my review on ""Dollars"" on IMDb also) but ""Yojimbo"" has its own superior traits. His direction is superb (but then again so is Leone's) - some of the shots in ""Yojimbo"" are so carefully structured it's hard to imagine even the most minute elements were incidental; everything seems planned.Toshirô Mifune is perfect as the antihero of the movie who we root for despite being a somewhat shady and ignorant character.If you liked ""For a Few Dollars More,"" do yourself a favor and check out the original version - you may like it better."

Thanos_Alfie,"Feb 2, 2015",7/10,"""Yojimbo"" is an action movie which is combined really well with drama. In this movie we have a town which is divided in two parts by two criminal gangs, and a samurai who comes in this town in order to free the citizen of it. So he decides to play them against each other to succeed his goal and free them all.I liked this movie because for one more time the plot and the direction from Akira Kurosawa was outstanding and I believe that this movie is one of his masterpieces. Also the cast was selected with the best criteria and this is obvious in the whole duration of the film because of their interpretation. Especially the interpretation of Toshirô Mifune who played as Sanjuro Kuwabatake the Samurai was simply outstanding for one more time. Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned is Tatsuya Nakadai's who played as Unosuke - Gunfighter.Finally I believe that ""Yojimbo"" is one of the best samurai movies in which Akira Kurosawa did his best as he does in all of his movies. In addition to this I have to say that ""Yojimbo"" reminded another movie which was also made by Akira Kurosawa the ""Seven Samurai"" which I also found very good."
jamesrupert2014,"Apr 22, 2024",9/10,"A disheveled ronin (an excellent Toshiro Mifune) aimlessly wanders into a town in which two rival clans are fighting a bloody turf war. After a messy demonstration of his expertise with a blade, the two bickering warlords try to outbid each other for his sanguineous services, not realising that the silent, po-faced killer has his own plans for the sad little town. Everything in this black-comedy-actioneer is near-perfect: Mifune leads a great cast including a number of Toho regulars such as Takashi Shimura, Tatsuya Nakadai, and Isuzu Yamada, the bleak set design owes more to Hollywood oaters than to Japanese jidaigeki, the B/W cinematography is crisp and moody, the story and characters are entertaining, the score is off-beat but effective, and the film delivers a number of clever touches embedded in a fast-moving blend of broad-comedy and chanbara action. Famously, Sergio Leone essentially duplicated Kurosawa's film as the iconic spaghetti-western 'A Fistful of Dollars' with a laconic drifting gunfighter (Clint Eastwood) replacing a laconic drifting samurai in a terrified town full of squabbling low-lifes (Leone claimed otherwise but ended up paying an out-of-court settlement to Toho Studios). The movie was a huge hit in Japan, and like its Western clone, was hugely influential on its genre. Followed in 1962 by 'Sanjuro', an equally entertaining sequel that finds Mifune's character once again dispensing quick katana-justice to Edo-era scoundrels. Watched with English subtitles."
bseagrave54,"Jul 14, 2008",9/10,"Yojimbo translates into English as Bodyguard, such as the protagonist in the film, Sanjuro Kuwabatake, the samurai. He finds his way to a town that is torn apart by two gangs who both believe they are entitled to run the town. The boss of each of the clans attempts to employ the samurai as a bodyguard and as the missing piece to take over the town. However, Kuwabatake has plans of his own. When Kuwabatake arrives to the town he proclaims, ""I get paid for killing and this town is full of men who are better off dead."" The line sent shivers down my spine, and set the tone for the rest of the movie.Akira Kurosawa shows why he is regarded as one of the best writers and directors to ever step on a movie set. The story unfolds beautifully in the rundown Japanese town in which it is set. Every element of the story worked together flawlessly to create another masterpiece by Kurosawa. Kurosawa's other movies include classics such as Rashomon, Ran, The Hidden Fortress, Throne of Blood, one of my all-time favorites The Seven Samurai.Yojimbo also influenced filmmakers from Sergio Leone to George Lucas. Leone remade Yojibo as A Fistful of Dollars, the first movie that featured Clint Eastwood as ""The Man with No Name,"" which later provided the sequels, For a Few Dollars More and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, another of my all-time favorites. George Lucas, creator of the Star Wars, my All-Time favorite, and Indiana Jones movie franchises also pays homage to Kurosawa in his films. Most notably is the identical scene of Kuwabatake cutting off a man's arm, and Obi-Wan Kenobi mimicking his actions in Star Wars. Yojimbo has everything needed to be a great movie, a superior story, a legendary director, good action, and some comedy. The film may be over 40 years old, but it still stands tall as a classic."
Eternality,"Sep 16, 2010",9/10,"Akira Kurosawa's most well-known film in Japan inspired several similar remakes such as the popular A Fistful Of Dollars helmed by Western legend Sergio Leone, and the forgettable Last Man Standing starring Bruce Willis. Ironically, Yojimbo is said to be Kurosawa's tribute to the Western genre. The film is pure Kurosawa - spectacular action, artistry, and dark humor combined. Apart from The Hidden Fortress, and Seven Samurai, this is one of the most entertaining of Kurosawa's films.Toshiro Mifune, the leading man in almost a dozen Kurosawa films, gives a vivid performance as an unemployed samurai who decides to act as a 'law enforcer' in a town under siege by gangs. Yojimbo starts memorably with a dog scampering across the street with a dislocated human hand between its teeth, a jolting sequence that prepares viewers for the onslaught of violence seen later in the film. Filmed in beautiful black-and-white, Yojimbo outstandingly recaptures a bygone era - nostalgic Japanese setting with western stylistic hues.There some parts (especially in the middle) that drags for quite long, which if edited cleverly would have made Yojimbo feel tighter, and consequently, more engrossing. But this minor flaw is eclipsed by Kurosawa's astute direction and his revered ability with the camera (which is always moving, and covering different angles). Yojimbo is an example of timeless Japanese cinema, something that will continue to entertain generations after generations. It's not Kurosawa's best effort, but there's no denying the fact that it's a visual delight.SCORE: 8.5/10 (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved!"
AaronBaron64,"May 26, 2019",9/10,"I'll keep this brief and spoiler free, the movie has 2 main point-on-the-nose aspects as i see it, First is the alleged cliche 'Hero-savior of the day' saves the damsel in distress and saves the town and walks away as the titular hero, Second is the reality of being the center of attention that comes with being a hero and also all the focused hurt.
He saves the damsel in distress like any good natured hero script would have him do but this butterfly effect leaves scores of innocents dying and the ending being cinematic and like classic Kurosawa fashion, leaves the final thoughts up to the viewer."
RossRivero99,"May 29, 2019",10/10,"This movie is the second movie directed by Akira Kurosawa that I've watched since watching ""Rashomon"" a few years back and while watching this movie I was not disappointed and it's another masterpiece that makes me even more eager to see his other highly acclaimed films like ""Seven Samurai"" (1954), ""Ikiru"" (1952), ""Throne of Blood"" (1957), ""Ran"" (1985), ""The Hidden Fortress"" (1958), ""Red Beard"" (1965), ""The Bad Sleep Well"" (1960), ""Kagemusha"" (1980),"" High and Low"" (1963), as well as the sequel to this film ""Sanjuro"" (1962). Toshiro Mifune stars in one of his strongest performances as Sanjuro a lone wolf samurai who comes into a small town in Japan in the mid 19th century to rid the town of two rival gangs by pitting them against each other and fighting them on his own, and thus inspired several westerns to follow mainly Sergio Leone's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964). Akira Kurosawa was to Japanese samurai films what John Ford was to American westerns, and each of them were masters whose movies are still talked about among film lovers everywhere and for good reason and this movie is another masterpiece in the Kurosawa-Mifune collaboration which is one of the all time great actor-director partnerships in all of movie history. The swordfight scenes are excellently choreographed, and what really helps with the movie is how Kurosawa places the music to build the suspense leading up to the final fight in the end which reminds me of the final shootout in ""High Noon"" when Gary Cooper's Marshall Will Kane had to face off against a gang of outlaws on his own. Mifune was one of those actors in Japan who had as big of a screen presence as John Wayne did in America. Everything about this movie just strikes the right notes especially with the intelligent writing, great performances, Kurosawa's masterful direction, excellent cinematography, and an amazing score. This is a must see for all people who love film , action movie lovers, as well as people who are interested in Japanese culture, I promise you will not be disappointed."
tankace,"Feb 26, 2017",9/10,"Yojimbo is an extremely important film for the film industry of in indirectly helped the spaghetti western been born as Sergio Leone pretty much copied the plot and made it a western which we now know it as A Fistfull of Dollars. It is a bit shocking for that times I felt that I was watch the same film with the only difference been the setting.To the plot as the Shogan period of Japan is ending the samurai are in mass fired because they don't have any role to play in this new world and here we meet our protagonist a ronin ( samurai without a master) who stumbles in a village which is ruled and terrorized by the two families there and so he starts to playing each other in order for them to be destroyed in their little war. To do show he uses his wits and great sword skills to create chaos. In general Kurosawa here shows us the samurai as bullies and a-holes who are in charge only because are better armed.As for our protagonist though he is the good guy he uses quit the unhonourable tactics to achieve his goal to free the village from its tyrants, which wasn't the norm for the samurai ,who there whole ideology ,the Bushido, was focused in honor and service, but as the era of the Samurai is over so to for that code and our ronin gives zero f***s about honor and he has a much more practical approach of the type ""the ends justify the means"".Also the setting was nicely made and you will find yet an other inspiration of an other film ,from a Galaxy Far Far Away ,but you have to look closely to find it.Over all I enjoy it and I respect its impact in film culture even though it was done through plagiarism."
Samiam3,"Aug 5, 2009",8/10,"I think a lot of movie fans would name The Seven Samurai or The Hidden Fortress as their #1 Kurosawa film, but Yojimbo is my favourite. You may find this hard to believe but this movie influenced Sergio Leone's A Fistfull of Dollars. The Man with no Name who has becomes the world's most famous cardboard character was based on Yojimbo's lead role.Once again, Toshiro Mifune stars. Set in the late 1800's, he plays a wandering Ronin (a samurai for hire, rather than in the service of a monarch) who stumbles upon a seemingly peaceful village after a long day of walking a dusty road. He soon discovers that the village is a battleground for two rival mobs. Both are eager to have our hero on their side, once they learn that he is a skilled warrior. He gets cleaver and turns this feud into a game, playing both side against each other with repetitious double crossing.Of course, there is a reason why Yojimbo is my favourite Kurosawa. It feels lighter and chirpier than the others. He adds a slight dose of dry humor to the premise, which keeps it from being too dark.He may be a slow story teller, but Kurosawa is no dud, he is a master craftsman. If you have patience and true cinematic appreciation, you will not question films like Yojimbo for a moment."
cricketbat,"Feb 22, 2021",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa once again tells a fascinating tale in a compelling way. I love it when a character believably uses their wits to defeat their opposition, and the protagonist does just that in Yojimbo. He also uses a sword to defeat his enemies, which is fun to see, too. He's not perfect, though, and makes mistakes, which makes the story seem more realistic. I'm looking forward to seeing the sequel, Sanjuro."
asifplay,"Nov 24, 2019",10/10,"Fascinating, wonderful tale. Extraordinary deep music creates an intense moment. This movie is a masterpiece."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Dec 27, 2021",8/10,"Very satisfying Kurosawa film that holds up well on a rewatch.Less action than I remember there being, but there's still plenty of exciting scenes and it moves well. Mifune's character is so badass and efficient at swordplay that it just doesn't allow for extended action sequences, which is kind of funny when you think about it. Nakadai is also fantastic as a guy who ends up being the main villain in a film with a town full of them.Some of the plot details are a little hard to keep track of, but you always have a handle on the core premise, which is the main thing. Overall, it's an exceptionally well directed film with two very good lead performances and a fun premise. Certainly lives up to its reputation."
lastliberal,"May 29, 2008",9/10,"The first ""man with no name"" was Toshirô Mifune, who made 16 films with writer/director Akira Kurosawa, starting with Drunken Angel in 1948, and ending with Red beard in 1965. This is one of his greatest performances.Anyone familiar with American or Italian spaghetti westerns will instantly see the story here. The loner walks into town and sees an opportunity to play both sets of bad guys against each other to make money from each. It is funny, and has lots of action as any western does.Forget any idea of foreign films when watching Mifune and Kurosawa. They are as familiar to you as films you grew up with. For great entertainment, they cannot be beat."
valleyjohn,"May 2, 2009",9/10,"I have been meaning to watch Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo for quite a while now. Ever since i heard that this was the film that inspired Sergio Leone to make A Fistful of Dollars i had to see what was the catalyst for not only a great series of Westerns but the careers of Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone.A dishevelled wandering samurai reaches a crossroads. Picking up a stick, he tosses it in the air. He then follows the direction the stick points. Thus we are introduced to the hero of this film, and at the same time shown that he is a ronin, a masterless samurai with no ties. Arriving in a nearby village, he discovers the place to be desolate and windswept, with no obvious signs of life. But in fact there are two rival gangs, led by Seibei and his former lieutenant Ushi-Tora, trying to monopolise the local trades. Seibei has the silk and sex trades parcelled up, while Ushi-Tora controls the sake. After demonstrating his strength as a samurai, both sides want to hire him as a yojimbo (bodyguard) so that they can finish off the other gang and have everything to themselves. The samurai, whom we learn is Sanjuro Kuwabataké (though that is undoubtedly not his real name), has other plans for the village. He proceeds to play one side off against the other in an attempt to destroy both.Nobody made films like Akira Kurosawa. Only having recently been introduced to his movies i must say they have had a big affect on me. Because they have influenced so many great film makers it has led me on to see some classic movies otherwise which i may have never had seen. I watched and reviewed The Seven Samurai and Ikiru recently but without doubt Yojimbo is my favourite. This film is dark yet humorous and you cant help but love the characters on show. The narrative is easy to follow and the acting is superb and as usual in all Akira Kurosawa's films , the protagonists on show are just that little bit mad! . But the best thing about Yojimbo is it's simplicity.Toshirô Mifune is fantastic as the scheming samurai and i also loved the performance of Daisuke Katô who played the cowardly brother of Ushitora. To be fair this does not resemble a Fistful of Dollars very much at all yet you can see how American westerns influenced the way Kurosawa made his movies .Yojimbo is fun to watch on every level and if you love movies and have not seen this before , you must!9 out of 10"
ericstevenson,"Jul 19, 2018",10/10,"Samurai films like these were actually a big influence on George Lucas. I have to admit that samurai movies were never my thing. They were also a big inspiration on Westerns, which I also wasn't a big fan of. It can be hard to follow a movie with just subtitles, especially one whose plot I don't know getting into. I'd probably still say ""Rashomon"" is my favorite Akira Kurosawa movie. This is still a great movie in itself.Actually, I think I was actually introduced to the plot of this movie by an episode of ""Pokémon""! It was ""Showdown At Dark City"" which featured these two gangs in a city trying to get help from Ash. You have to give the anime credit for referencing something so highbrow. Anyway, the basic plot is that this guy named Sanjuro (not Yojimbo) goes to this corrupt village where two rival gangs both want him to work for him. As you might have guessed, he ends up playing both of them. There are few sympathetic characters at first.We do see some nice villagers who just want everybody to stop fighting. Sanjuro is shown to have no allies in this film prior to the story. It's a great way of seeing how a single character can play off of everyone else. There's even some really nice social and technological commentary. One guy has a gun which is an odd place for a samurai film. I also felt that the length of this film was just perfect. ****"
Cinemad_ziddi,"Nov 21, 2020",8/10,"""Good Artists copy, great artists steal"". This quote, often attributed to Picasso is apt for Yojimbo whose scene by scene, lift off of ""A fistful of dollars"" spawned a whole genre of Westerns. So perhaps some would regard Sergio Leone as a ""great artist"" whose ""cheat"" have inspired so many movies that any random Hollywood Western movie buff must have watched the formula scenes when a lone cowboy walks in a deserted town, sharp shoots his way into the audiences heart then finally triumphs in the one- on-one duel with the villain. But for serious audiences wondering about the derivation of the formula, have to watch amongst other Samurai movies by Kurosawa, Yojimbo- definitely amongst the most entertaining of the lot. Audiences who enjoyed the samurai sword play in ""Kill Bill"" should get their teeth into Yojimbo. Kurosawa, incidentally belonged to the family of Samurai. The fight scenes are few and far between, but so vividly picturised that they deliver immense impact without being grotesque or should I say Tarantinoesque. Camera work is of course the forte of Kurosawa who started out as a painter just as one of his other illustrious Asian contemporary Satyajit Ray. No wonder his scenes seems to spring out as a flipping of a series of sketches- with Japanese musical instruments enhanced music, electrifying the visual delight.
I wish I could compare Yojimbo with Maula Jutt and give a critical comment on the influence of Japanese Samurai movies on Punjabi ""western"" cult movie, but I am afraid I have not watched the latter yet. Wonder what "" Maula ko maula na maare to maule nahin murda"" in Japanese would sound like."
ian23,"Mar 5, 2002",10/10,"Hardly any frame in this beautifully shot black and white picture-- a masterpiece of pacing and characterization-- is wasted.This film gets referenced in everything from the book 'alan mendelsohn, the boy from mars' to the comic 'usagi yojimbo.'  See why.By turns brutal & chilling and warm & humorous, this is one of my favorite Kurasawa pictures."
Uriah43,"May 17, 2025",8/10,"This film takes place in the later part of the Edo Dynasty, with a highly skilled ronin, who initially calls himself ""Sanjuro Kawabatake"" (Toshiro Mifune), walking into a small village plagued by conflict between two hostile factions. On one end of the town is a businessman named ""Seibei"" (Seizaburo Kawazu), who runs the local brothel and until recently controlled all of the gambling interests there. On the other end of the town is another man named ""Ushitora"" (Kyu Sazanka), who used to work for Seibei but has since had a falling out with him and, as a result, has decided to take over the lucrative gambling business for himself. To that end, since Seibei has enough money to hire bodyguards to maintain his power base, Ushitora endears himself to the only other wealthy businessman in town, named ""Tokeuemon"" (Takashi Shimura), who brews and distributes all of the sake for that area. To cement their alliance, Ushitora hires several thugs of his own and vows to help Tokeuemon should his kidnapped mistress ""Nui"" (Yoko Tsukasa) attempt to return to her husband ""Kohei"" (Yoshio Tsuchiya) and their young child. To that effect, the cunning Sanjuro inflames the situation even further to benefit himself directly. What he doesn't anticipate, however, is the arrival of a dangerous killer named ""Usokuke"" (Tatsuya Nakadai), who is related to Ushitora and has his own plan to eliminate Seibei-and the ronin named Sanjuro as well. Now, rather than reveal any more, I will just say that this is one of those classic Japanese films that entertains from start to finish with generous amounts of action, intrigue, and a touch of comedy to satisfy most viewers. As a matter of fact, it was so successful that it was remade as a Western a few years later by Sergio Leone under the title of ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" starring Clint Eastwood in the leading role. So, if you liked that movie, you will probably enjoy this one as well. Admittedly, like so many other Japanese films, some of the acting is a bit over the top, but even so, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie, and I have rated it accordingly."
Atavisten,"Feb 1, 2011",8/10,"This seems like a classic plot for a western, but instead of a cowboy a poor masterless samurai comes into a town torn between two gangs and tries to cash in on them as he is the key to victory with his unsurpassed sword-technique. A game starts.Toshiro Mifune is able to carry this movie on his own, his presence on screen, like his sword-mastery is second to none. Luckily this movie also has the visual mind of Akira Kurosawa and a fitting set. This town is on the verge of becoming a ghost town, by senseless killing and rivalry.Under Kurosawa's supervision this movie has no dull moment whatsoever, and once the action picks up you're locked in for the rest of it. It's also well cast, I just wish the giant would fight with his club. The old man in the restaurant next to the coffin maker is my favorite character next to Yojimbo. And some poor guys arm get cut off so the blood spurts out like from a fire-hose, Kurosawa invented that."
neonadventure,"Jun 16, 2019",8/10,"Yojimbo is one of Kurosawa's greatest works to appear on theaters and there's no denying that. Mifune, playing as the wandering samurai who encounters a gang war between the gambling business and the prostitution business.There is really not that much to say about this film other than just watch it. Comedy was an important part in playing this story by showing the enemy's actual weaknesses and it's hilarious. Kurosawa's theory of movement in film plays well as it shows the audience that there is movement on screen and it's important for visual storytelling. Having Mifune scratch his shoulders with his head to help the audience understand that it's the main character or using dust flying across the screen are a few examples of powerful movement in film. This classic was later created into a spaghetti western movie, ""Fistful of Dollars"" which became the first of the three films that Clint Eastwood starred in and if this film didn't exist, then the greatest western film of all time wouldn't exist either."
gothic_a666,"Sep 24, 2010",8/10,"'Yojimbo' is a world of fun. Everything in it, from the quirky characters to the zany atmosphere without forgetting the bombastic soundtrack or the trademark action scenes, goes into creating a very entertaining movie. There is nothing cult-like about it, instead there is highly competent production that is truly gripping. The Western movie vibes draw attention a particular Japanese point of view without making it difficult to be enjoyed by a broader audience.In being so immediate in the way even a casual viewer can apprehend it 'Yojimbo' runs the risk of not being appreciated for the innovative movie it was. I watched a documentary with some of the people involved in making it and it was delightful to see how enthusiastic they still were decades after. It also showed how the techniques that went into filming and the sound effects were so ground breaking at the time. Kuorosawa also built an entire town down to the most minute of details and went to great lengths to achieve the dust blowing in the wind effect.The result is a movie that aged beautifully and that pointed in the direction that would be followed by so many. This timeless appeal is one of the reasons why 'Yojimbo' is such an overall hit on all fronts. Gripping and just fun. It is always wonderful to be entertained by a movie that is genuinely well done, beautifully crafted and to simply relax to something that is not a guilty pleasure."
lyubitelfilmov,"Nov 25, 2020",9/10,"Adventure. A picture of the famous, iconic and outstanding Japanese director Akira Kurosawa, whom I finally got my hands on. This path was long and thorny, especially the choice of his paintings, but after much deliberation, I chose three pictures, and in the near future there will be reviews on them, and this adventure movie comes first, which became the cause of many inspirations and even a scandal between the masters of that time - Akira Kurosawa and Sergio Leone, but you know this story without me, so I see no reason to retell it here, because it will be a purely painting. And here's my brief opinion - Ronin is putting things in order. I want to state right away that I did not notice the minuses in the film, although there is a small remark, which I will say separately, but for now, let me focus your attention on the advantages of this adventure from the master of Japanese cinema.
So, here they are:
1. Scenario - the picture tells about the adventures of a wandering ronin, who ends up in a small village, whose inhabitants languish from endless bloodshed, for two strong criminals share power over it. Ronin decides to play on this and it becomes the beginning of a series of events, both fun and not so, fights and the like. The scenario skeleton from this picture was played many times in world cinema, both before this work of Kurosawa (which he himself admitted to) and after (the story with Sergio Leone and beyond), and this is not bad. Akira himself was in charge of the script, and he did a great job with it. I literally could not take my eyes off the screen, because every detail, every movement of the characters and so on, every spoken word clung to me. The ending was known to me, because I watched ""For a Fistful of Dollars"", and it is not only correct, but also effectively filmed. If you love Japanese themes, a good script - then you simply must see this picture!
2. Atmosphere - Japan of the shogunate era, with its familiar attributes - houses, samurai, clothes, characteristic hairstyles, everyday life, and so on. The atmosphere literally captures the viewer from the first frame, and does not let go until the last, and the black and white picture does not interfere with this in any way (especially since black and white cinema saves vision). And lovers of historical cinema will get their portion of pleasure.
3. Humor - I was even surprised at this. He is unassuming here, because almost everything boils down to the stupid behavior of the characters or antics on camera, which turns serious and dramatic scenes into a natural farce, and you feel ashamed of the heroes who do it. Some of the jokes were successful, and I had a lot of fun with them. I could put humor in the minus of the picture until I understood the director's move - Akira deliberately made the heroes like that, therefore - no complaints.
4. Fights - today they look like a fight between drunken Tolkienists, to be frank, because they are absolutely no spectacle. I give credit to the directors and actors who moved in the frame very convincingly and played very naturally. I give a discount for the release time, because this is one thousand nine hundred and sixty-first, ladies and gentlemen and comrades!
A little about the main characters:
1. Ronin performed by Toshiro Mifune is a wandering warrior who, by the will of fate, arrived in the village, where it is urgently necessary to restore order. A cunning fellow and a professional fighter who turns a clever plan. Absolutely not a superhero, but a man with his own mistakes. Laconic and with a pinch of humor - this is how Toshiro's hero turned out, and I liked him. Bravo Toshiro!
2. Daisuke Kato's Inokichi is the brother of one of the village's crime bosses. Cheerful and memorable hero, although it plays a negative role. His antics were very amusing throughout the whole picture. Daisuke clearly coped with the role. Well done!
3. Gonji performed by Eijiro Tohno - owner of the tavern where the ronin is staying. At first, he hates this stranger, but gradually he is imbued with sympathy, and even becomes a friend, since only the ronin is able to end the bloody chaos in the village. Eijiro superbly played the role of a gloomy and eccentric old man. Bravo!
As for the remark, there is one object in the picture that spoils the atmosphere and asks Akira uncomfortable questions, but I will not dwell on this. It's just that this object is in sight and flickers before your eyes all the time. Either this is Akira's jamb, or the creators' flaw, I don't know here.
Well, the next picture of Kurosawa will be the legendary ""Seven Samurai"".
As a result, we have an excellent adventure movie by Akira Kurosawa, with an excellent script, great atmosphere, pleasant and unexpected humor and great acting."
davidmvining,"Apr 2, 2022",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa's most purely fun film, Yojimbo is the work of a master simply out to give his audience a good time. With a light and playful tone that gives way to an earned feeling of peril, Kurosawa's seemingly frothy ronin tale ends up one of the most thoroughly entertaining films of his entire career. Anchored by a wonderful score by Masaru Sato and a pitch-perfect central performance by Kurosawa's main star Toshiro Mifune, Yojimbo is a pure delight.A masterless samurai who calls himself Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Mifune), which means ""Thirty-year old Mulberry Field"" (""though I'm nearly 40 now,"" he informs someone) wanders randomly into a town torn apart by conflict between two warring factions of gamblers, thieves, and brutes. He survey's the situation, receiving key background from Gonji (Eijiro Tono), the owner of a tavern. When the local boss Seibei (Seizaburo Kawazu) decided to grant ownership of the organization to his son Yoichiro (Hiroshi Tachikawa) instead of his righthand man Ushitora (Kyu Sazanka). Ushitora was so enraged, he took half of Yoichiro's men, and the two have been recruiting drifters and criminals ever since in an endless war of attrition over control of the silk manufacturing town. Out of either a sense of justice or just to entertain himself, Sanjuro decides that he's going to destroy both factions, but how? After thinking it over with some sake, he goes over to Ushitora's men, kills three of them with his sword effortlessly, and then walks right over to Seibei's to demand payment for his services as bodyguard. The idea is to get the two factions at a fever pitch as quickly as possible so they slaughter each other with Seibei using the opportunity of Sanjuro's presence and earned reputation as a killer to strike while the iron is hot.He uses the scheming of Seibei's wife Orin (Isuzu Yamada) to kill Sanjuro right after the battle as an excuse to return the thirty ryo they paid him to work for Seibei and sit out the fight, climbing a tower in the middle of town to gleefully watch the slaughter happen, having reached a pitch that almost nothing could temper. Well, except the visit of a Shogun inspector from Edo. His arrival prompts a ten-day period of an uncomfortable peace where everything must look normal while Sanjuro hangs out in the tavern, wondering when and which side will offer him money first to come and work for them. They both show up, represented by Orin on one side and Ushitora's halfwit younger brother Inokichi (Daisuke Kato).Things begin to go in the wrong direction when a magistrate dozens of miles away gets murdered, forcing the inspector to leave. The peace is going to continue for a time, though, with an important silk festival coming up, they need the town clean in order to bring in more money. Sanjuro won't allow this, allowing them to restrengthen themselves, so when he overhears the grumbling of two Ushitora men about how they risked their lives for seemingly nothing, Sanjuro knows that it was them who killed the magistrate, and he sets a new plan into immediate action, capturing them and giving them to Seibei. With the prospect of destroying Ushitora completely, the idea of peace falls away from Seibei and the scheming begins anew.Another complication arises with the arrival of Ushitora's other brother Unosuke (Tatsuya Nakadai), a psychopath who has somehow managed to pick up a revolver on his year long travels. It's a way to up the stakes, threat, and tension as Sanjuro has to adapt quickly. Mifune really is one of the joys of the film, but he's helped a lot by the fact that the character he's playing is so well written. He's smart, inventive, and adaptive while Mifune provides him a marvelously dismissive attitude to it all. When a barrier comes up in his plan, he figures a way around it. When the knowledge of the taken lackeys reaches Ushitora, a pair of kidnappings happen in quick order. This gives us a late introduction to a pair of characters, and I immediately felt a bit annoyed. Tokuemon (Takashi Shimura) is a figurehead mayor put in place by Ushitora, and he stole Nui (Yoko Tsukasa), the wife of Kohei (Yoshio Tsuchiya) when he couldn't pay back gambling debts. They also have a son. Upon its introduction, this feels like it's going to drive the narrative for a while, and the late introduction irked me. However, as it played out the decision made more sense.Up until this point, Sanjuro has been a disconnected troll, essentially. He's just been driving the two to destroy each other for opaque motives, and the sudden investment in actual people caught in the crossfire adds a new dimension to his character. It's about him, not them. His efforts to free them show that his motive is more altruistic than they might have been, but they also form the basis of his dramatic downturn when Unosuke (no dummy himself), figures out that it was Sanjuro who helped them escape, not Seibei's men like Sanjuro insisted. This brings Sanjuro into real peril and sets up the final, nearly apocalyptic conflict.What's interesting to me about the movement of the plot is how it goes from playful and almost irreverent to serious in terms of its sense of danger around out main character. Sanjuro might be my favorite Mifune character. As previously stated, it's both how he's written and performed. Mifune brings a subtle wit to the character in addition to the intelligence of how he's written. It's a surprisingly subtle and almost comic performance from the man, and I think it shows how much he'd grown as an actor in the decade or so since he had started working with Kurosawa. He really was a movie star in the fullest sense of the word, and he takes a strong script and helps to elevate it.Kurosawa himself brings his A-game again as well, filming in beautiful Tohoscope and filling each frame fully and intelligently. Compositions are fantastic from beginning to end, completely taking advantage of the large outdoor set and the placement of his actors to make wonderful looking frames from beginning to end, all while managing the whole cast, helping to give this light story surprising emotional heft and impact.Yojimbo is primo entertainment, up with Seven Samurai in Kurosawa's body of work. It's also an hour and a half shorter, which makes for easier watching."
ThurstonHunger,"Apr 28, 2024",8/10,"My son for an East Asian history/politics class at an Art University watched this, and I had somehow never seen this, nor any of the Kurosawa trilogy. I mean I had even read volume one of ""Usagi Yojimbo"" before seeing this, inexcuasable.Glad to have corrected this, and I would say you could watch this just for the music and be well rewarded. Tremendous soundtrack by Masaru Sato.A 1961 film looking feudal Japan is not simply that. The presence of a gun, and I would have bet that the actor wielding that was a Westener could say something about American fast/cheap and out of control devaluing of life. However Tatsuya Nakadai apparently was not an American gone amok. Still there is something to that.Also any film with coffin transportation, the best way to defeat death I suppose is to start it down directly like that. Toshiro Mifune goes through a pretty remarkable death-defying series of blows and a wonderfully filmed escape underground. You cannot keep a good and bold man down!Other cartoon like characters on both the warring sides, and local yokels - give the film more levity than a macho sort of action film I expected. And the message of rising above the political/criminal (synonymous often, no?) machinations - by not just playing one side of the other, but climbing up a town watchtower to look literally down upon them; what a great message as our 2024 USA presidential election looms like a destructive clown show as well.Very good, and like me - you might want to listen to the full soundtrack on a loop via youtube afterwards."
Seraphion,"Oct 17, 2015",8/10,"The movie is indeed a gem as it has great strengths. The story is so strong that it develops nicely over the fast paced flow. I really enjoy how the story develops and unravels with its twists and turns. The characters are also well developed as they unravel in time, revealing multiple layers of themselves and possibly changing audiences' view toward them. The directing is a great job since the movie successfully maximizes utilization on just a few sets to tell a great story like this. The bits of action sequences are also well directed, despite the lack of technology for that time. The acting is also quite nice, particularly Toshiro Mifune. His character is nicely portrayed that the layers of the character's true intention gets peeled well."
varundelpiero,"Oct 29, 2008",9/10,"By the time Kurosawa decided to embark upon YOJIMBO (in 1960/1), he had already established himself as a legendary filmmaker in the West and decided to pay homage to one of the West's more notoriously famous film genres: The Western. While this film is actually regarded as homage to the Western, the careful observer will see that the film also sporadically pokes fun at the genre; another example of Kurosawa'a brilliance.The film itself is wonderfully done; it represents Kurosawa in his element: storytelling, and there is no shortage of plot twists here for the avid viewer to enjoy. The direction and screenplay are excellent, as is the acting, as Toshiro Mifune (think of him as such: De Niro is to Scorsese as Mifune is to Kurosawa) produces perhaps his finest role on film, perhaps because he is the central character and not part of an ensemble. Mifune's character is the personification of cool; the anti-heroic mercenary who never seems to be fazed. His portrayal in this Motion Picture even ranks among (and some may argue higher) Clint Eastwood's best. Tatsuya Nakadai is also impressive as Mifune's most significant 'villain'.The music itself is also amazing, perhaps the best in any Kurosawa film, especially the mood-setting opening piece. Notably though, Ennio Morricone's score for the remake PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI was a bit better. The final verdict here is that there is plenty to enjoy and appreciate in this masterpiece by the master storyteller.It is also worth noting that this film, while an homage to Westerns, was the inspiration behind Sergio Leone's PER UN PUGNO DI DOLLARI, which helped sparked the spaghetti Western revolution. As such, it is difficult to imagine what the Western would be like today were it not for YOJIMBO. On a side note, this film also served as a reference for LAST MAN STANDING, but the less said about that film, the better...So here comes the inevitable question: Where does YOJIMBO stand in Kurosawa's collection? While not as grand or epic in scope as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, or as intellectually stimulating or thought-provoking as RASHOMON, it is easy to see why many viewers will regard YOJIMBO as Kurosawa's best, due to its wider appeal (for instance, it is not nearly as long as SHICHININ NO SAMURAI, not as puzzling as RASHOMON, plus it has a strong comedic element to it). I personally rank it as Kurosawa'a third best, behind the aforementioned.3.5 stars (out of 4). 8/10. Should enter my Top 150 at about 138 or so. Strongly recommended."
DarkTimesDeserveDarkMovies,"May 13, 2022",10/10,"If you didn't know, this film was ripped off from a famous Spaghetti Western. A unique story that life can be a flip of a coin (or stick). Kuraswa at the top of his game."
emryse,"Jun 25, 2022",8/10,"The majority of the fight scenes don't hold up, that is my one major criticism. They have the problem a lot of films of the time faced where they didn't have any blood when people are cut, they just fall over. Apart from this though this film is fantastic.The characters are all interesting and are served excellently with strong performances by the cast. Kurosawa manages to always fill his characters with, well character, making even the smallest of roles memorable. The cinematography is beautiful, feeling timeless in a way many films do not, the story is a somewhat basic premise but is taken in interesting directions and plays out in a satisfying way. The music is also delightful.Want proof this film is great, Sergio Leone, a genius in his own right, made an almost shot for shot remake of it he enjoyed it so much! If like me you are trying to broaden your film knowledge then exploring the films of Kurosawa is an excellent place to start, he also wrote a very interesting book but that is beside the point.A master at work, partnered with the brilliant Toshirô Mifune, of course this film was going to be good. A solid 8/10."
henrikb,"Aug 17, 1999",10/10,"Kurosawa's tale of the lone fighter that comes to town, cleans up and leaves is wonderfully executed. I love to watch this film for the cinematography and the understated humour. A very enjoyable film, and another of Kurosawa's japanese ""westerns""."

MarcoParzivalRocha,"Sep 25, 2020",9/10,"An unnamed ronin (played by Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest legends of Asian cinema, and personal favorite of Kurosawa) arrives at a village that is controlled by two rival gangs, and elaborates a plan to destroy each other with the minimum of possible collateral damage. It is the most relaxed and ""goofy"" film of the Kurosawa samurai cycle, with short moments of humor, of 4 or 5 seconds, superior to entire comedies of our modern days. One of the initial jokes made me laugh in the theater as I hadn't remembered in months (something fantastic for a film made in 1961). The more serious and dramatic part, if we can call it that, tells in a beautiful way the story of an individual who despite his misery and personal tragedy has a sense of honor and respect for others with no match. This film is a landmark, and a guideline for many american western classics."
Dolchi,"Jun 10, 2022",9/10,"A few people know well that the ""Star Wars"" series were inspired in part by the wandering samurai (Ronin) films like ""Yojimbo"" of fabled Japanese director, Akira Kurosowa. This speaks volumes about how important a movie this is. Even from a pure entertainment point of view, this film is extremely good and never misses a note.Toshiro Mifune gives one of his best performances. The film has a plethora of characters who all perform adequately for this movie to be impeccable. Barring a few moments where the acting of some can be labeled cheesy, the movie is top notch. Some moments do remind us of similar scheming in samurai movies. Yet, the writing is so fresh that we are never reminded of any stereotypes and are instead greeted with an invigorating thread of unique perspectives offered through this Ronin."
monsterhunt-94296,"Nov 16, 2020",8/10,"Yojimbo is the third film I've seen directed by Akira Kurosawa. I'll start off with my negatives so I don't forget. So, the movie has a lot of characters. It takes place in this small town, and it kind of dumps the entire backstory in one scene and I wish it would've been spread out more, although I understand that would've caused a longer runtime. The movie did start to drag a little probably around 3/4ths of the way through before it quickly picks back up for the last 10 minutes or so. As for the positives, the film has incredible cinematography and choreography (Kurosawa does a great job at making sure the movement of the actors creates an interesting frame). It's not as action packed as Seven Samurai, but the film is very entertaining for the majority of the runtime. This is in part due to the great sense of humor thrown in there. The protagonist of the story is a ronin who is very clever throughout the movie and is acted very well by Toshiro Mifune. If you're wondering about the plot, the film focuses on this samurai (whose name is only said once throughout the entire thing, he's mostly referred to by a nickname or just ""the samurai"") and this small town that has a lot of issues. It's small scale, but there are plenty of stakes and tension throughout. The plot was well crafted, it was very well directed, and everybody was well written. I'd give Yojimbo an 8/10."

yellowtail_tuna,"Sep 13, 2020",10/10,"A swordsman wanders to a small town. He gets interested in the situation when he finds two gang groups are confronting each other.The film is entirely focused on entertainment. The center is of course the swordsman, played by Toshiro Mifune, later randomly naming himself 'Kuwabatake Sanjuro'. I love how he strolls the deserted street, drawing his hands into his kimono, blown in the wind. That's cool! The surrounding people are cautiously staring at him from a distance, wondering what he is going to do. He seems to even enjoy the limelight.Sanjuro goes in a bar, where he learns the situation from the old owner Gonji, the almost only person who remains sensible in the town that is infested with violence. I'm impressed by how Sanjuro talks to Gonji as if he was an old friend of Gonji's. While being simple and blunt, I think Sanjuro's true nature is friendliness.As one of the two groups, Seibei's family is desperate in an attempt to overcome the disadvantage, only to be easily manipulated by Sanjuro. On the other hand, my favorite among Ushitora's gang is Inokichi, the retard who likes fighting like a kid. He smiles goofily when flattered about his strength. Not only Inokichi, but all the gangs are mostly stupid, and no one compares with Sanjuro in cleverness. It seemed to be easy for Sanjuro to exploit them, but the mood changes when the psychopathic Unosuke returns.The situation changes one after another as the plot goes on at a brisk tempo. Unexpected thing happens at every turn. All in the film is just a gang war, and there is nothing deep. But you will be compelled all along with the film, because of the characters and direction. Camera movement works as the director's eloquent language. Characters are arranged from near to far, fully utilizing the space, sometimes with the effective use of window fences. The percussion soundtrack makes scenes either thrilling or humorous."
bobsgrock,"Dec 28, 2008",9/10,"A masterless samurai wanders into an anonymous town and finds that two different rival gangs are warring against each other for the rights to own it. This samurai, known only as Sanjuro, decides to play along both sides in hopes of destroying them both.This story is probably most well-known to those fans of the Clint Eastwood trilogy Man With No Name as this was the story in the first film, A Fistful of Dollars. As it turns out, the great Japanese director Akira Kurosawa made it first just three years prior. Here, the fabulous actor Toshiro Mifune portrays a restless, yet brilliant samurai who tries to help free a town by working with both sides against each other, thus defeating them both. It is an intriguing plot, and works for both Kurosawa and Fistful director Sergio Leone. Here, there is also a feel of a western set in a Japanese samurai era. There are some great face-offs between the two parties and the action scenes are splendid. If you are a Kurosawa fan, this is a must-see. If you like A Fistful of Dollars, it is also worth checking out to see where the story originated."
bigverybadtom,"Sep 24, 2022",8/10,"In late medieval Japan, a lone unemployed samurai is wandering along a road. Eventually he enters a town where two factions are fighting to control its gambling racket. Disgusted by both sides, the samurai, calling himself ""Sanjuro"", offers his services to the leader of one faction, proving himself by killing several of the other faction's men (who were criminals on the run). But when he learns of the leader's wife's plan to betray him, he resigns, hoping the two factions will simply wipe each other out, especially when the two factions are guilty of other heinous crimes. But it takes help from the protagonist...There is not only violence but comedy in the story as well, where Sanjuro mockingly tells one of the criminals he is about to kill, ""It'll hurt!"" Also when many of the criminals turn out to be idiots and Sanjuro tricks them easily. Proof that Japanese have a sense of humor."
crculver,"Aug 17, 2015",8/10,"Akira Kurosawa's 1961 film YOJIMBO is a Japanese period drama where wily strategy is worth just as much as prowess with a sword. In the late Edo era (some decades before its end in 1868) a community is plagued by two opposing gangs who have built up a criminal empire of prostitution and gambling. Even the local officials are on the take. Into this town steps a nameless samurai (Toshiro Mifune). Once they get a taste of his swordsmanship, both sides want to hire him, but he decides to play them off against each other and free the innocent citizens from this evil.In past films Kurosawa had taken advantage of Mifune's ability to produce exaggerated facial expressions of laughter and fear. Here, however, the nameless samurai is completely unflappable, while it is the criminal bosses and corrupt officials who play the clowns. Ikio Sawamura is a town constable constantly toadying to the gangsters, for example, while Isuzu Yamada gives a memorably sassy performance as the madame of a brothel. In what would become a convention of the Japanese period drama, the numerous henchmen in the gangs were apparently chosen from the most grotesque men that Kurosawa could find (each furthermore has distinctively ratty attire), and one thug is played by an actor suffering from gigantism.That darkly comedic drama between the characters coexists with brutal violence. Yet, while audiences may have been shocked in 1961 by the samurai dispatching his opponents with realistic slashing sound effects and a hacked off limb, there are only a handful of fights here, and they are all over in a flash. (Indeed, one of the most striking aspects of Mifune's acting is his speed in executing the sword moves.) While Kurosawa delights in gangsters getting their comeuppance, he doesn't revel in gore.Much has been said about how this Japanese film would inspire Westerns made in America and Europe (Sergio Leone's A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS was a straight-up remake). However, the film is also interesting for how it draws so much on influences from the West. Kurosawa's inspiration was an American crime caper by Dashiell Hammett, the samurai's walk down the main street is drawn from the Westerns of John Ford et al., the soundtrack mixes Japanese music with Western instruments such as harpsichord, and Tatsuya Nakadai's pretty-boy looks are clearly modeled on Hollywood.All in all, I was very impressed by this film. Everything here – from the script and aspect to little things like the wind and dust and the little decorations on the set – seems the result of great effort and talent, all coming together to impress the viewer. And like Kurosawa's RASHOMON, it stays fresh even as its elements have been repeatedly reused by other film and television productions for half a century now.Note that Kurosawa would go on to use Mifune's character again the next year in the film SANJURO, and the two films are often considered together."
christopher-underwood,"Apr 3, 2019",8/10,"It is a delight to return to this, particularly after watching so many spaghetti westerns, that surely would never have even existed as a genre but for this Kurosawa gem. A little overlong perhaps and a bit confusing at times but it brings a smile to the face to watch the grinning, growling and gungho, jobless samurai marching back and forth muddy street selling himself to the highest bidder and promising the undertaker plenty of business. An amazing array of animated individuals populate this simple yet absorbing tale inspired by American westerns and destined to initiate their greatest cinematic compliment that would be begun a couple of years later by Sergio Leone."
ArtVandelayImporterExporter,"Mar 19, 2023",8/10,"Stranger wanders into town. Sees there is a violent feud going on. Decides he can profit by playing both sides. Lethal hijinks ensue.There's your plot. Could not be more straightforward. Apparently it comes from Dashiell Hammett's novel, Red Harvest. Most people recognize it from Sergio Leone's A Fistful of Dollars. Turns out, he basically just re-wrote Yojimbo. Nearly scene for scene, actually. Which is ironic since Kurosawa was a fan of Hollywood and Yojimbo is for all intents and purposes a Japanese western.Toshiro Mifune is just as much of a stud as Clint Eastwood, so we get plenty of stoicism and manly killing. But the Kurosawa/Mifune effort reveals a sense of humor that isn't in the Leone/Eastwood version. That's not a criticism of either film, just an observation.There are no great truths revealed in either movie. And that's OK. Sometimes it's fine to just have fun for 90 minutes."
SPZMaxinema,"Apr 17, 2022",8/10,"This might be a controversial opinion but I actually like this movie better than Seven Samurai. The story progressed very well and in unexpected directions, and I liked the main character quite a bit! The ending felt satisfying!"
Hitchcoc,"Sep 10, 2009",9/10,"I have been reviewing the Kurosawa canon. This is really an interesting film because of the character of the townspeople. They have none. When Sanjuro comes to the town looking for work, he quickly realizes that he has walked into hell. Being wise and perceptive, he quickly uses the greed and avarice to his advantage. By pitting the two town factions against each other, he not only gives himself purpose, he cleans up a cesspool. This is scene after scene of bitter commentary by the town leaders. They take great joy in persecuting one another, yet they are cowardly, hoping that Sanjuro will take their side. Death is everywhere. One of the most interesting scenes is when the coffin maker leaves because there aren't enough left in the town to pay for his coffins.Mifune became a star in this film. His cold presence and, yes, even his vulnerability (he is seriously injured) make him an interesting hero. One can sense the disgust his character feels toward this awful town. Kurowawa seemed to take a slightly lighter touch later on, making things a bit more comedic. There is nothing comedic in this film. It's a desolate piece of work."
Bob Yojimbo,"Dec 12, 1999",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa once again shows why he is the greatest director that ever lived. From start to finish Yojimbo is a true masterpiece without flaw. The atmosphere that is created by the sound and camera work instantly grabs your attention and refuses to let go at any point. Toshiro Mifune is, as always, superb in the leading role as a masterless samurai who plays two rival gangs off against each other. His portrayal of the strong but kind samurai rivals his great performance in Seven Samurai. With a brilliant cast, great humour and quality action scenes, if you watch only one film in your life, I hope you watch this one."
KnightsofNi11,"Jul 23, 2010",8/10,"Yojimbo is a classic film from the genius mind of Akira Kurosawa. It was influenced by many of the American spaghetti western films coming out in this time period, and was the influence of A Fistful of Dollars (1964), one of Clint Eastwood's breakout roles. Yojimbo tells the story of a wise and mysterious samurai named Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshirô Mifune) who arrives in a small village in the wake of destruction because of two rival gangs. Sanjuro decides that to save the innocent commoners of the village, he will play the gangs against each other to the point of demise. His plan comes with ups and downs and an exciting story unravels with gripping action and compelling characters.Akira Kurosawa was a genius at what he did, and this shows through the level of delicate intricacy woven into the plot and visual aesthetic of Yojimbo. Every shot is flawless. He was a master of long drawn out shots that allow the actors to act and the story to unfold more like a stage play than a film. Yojimbo is a beautiful film in it's own slow and delicate way. What Kurosawa is able to achieve with such limited technology, and upon such a simple backdrop is truly phenomenal. The entirety of the film is a visual joy to watch.Kurosawa was also a master of compelling storytelling. Yojimbo plays out as a fun and exciting adventure story about a likable samurai with all the essential hero qualities, as well as the qualities of the unconventional hero. Sanjuro is very wise and quick on his feet, he is an impressive character to watch and Toshirô Mifune's performance keeps you constantly interested in what the character has to say or do. Yojimbo may not seem like it is a groundbreaking film the does the unthinkable and pushes the boundaries of conventional storytelling, yet it was for its time. Just like most of Kurosawa's films, the story sets the stage for many films to come in the future. It is these future films that push the limits of what Kurosawa and other older filmmakers established. They have to, or else they are forgotten in the sea of films with such a similar storyline.Yojimbo is stunning and exciting in every way. It is a classic film on a grand and epic scale. It's archetypes and processes of storytelling have lasted for generations and most likely will last for many more to come. In the back catalog of movies that began a new era of filmmaking and storytelling, Yojimbo is a fantastic example."
jackasstrange,"May 10, 2014",10/10,"What an astonishing bad-ass film. In fact, is just way bad-ass. Is bad-ass to the point of being a flaw, really. It starts from the incredible opening credits, with that super awesome tribal theme, following the back of the bad-ass of the bad-asses Sanjuro, the samurai. And Toshiro Mifune perhaps created in Sanjuro's character the most awesome character of all times. Screw it The man with no name. This one is the real deal. Is unbelievable, really, how bad-ass Sanjuro is. He is cold,has a very high confidence in himself an has an even annoying superiority complex and is incredibly egoist. The story is also very engaging.The final sequence is fantastic.Anyway, the film is another masterpiece by Kurosawa. My only complaint is the following: it looks way too much with a ""western"" film(I am referring to western culture, and not the genre of films)."
SnorriGodhi,"Oct 21, 2006",10/10,"In Scientific American (Feb. 1998) John R. Hale wrote: ""Plato may have denied the existence of ideal forms in this world, but Plato never saw a Viking ship."" In fact, Plato had several disadvantages: he saw the Parthenon, of course; but he never listened to JS Bach, and he never tasted Islay whisky; most relevant here is that Plato never saw a Japanese sword.If there is a better way to appreciate the Japanese sword than to see this movie, I don't know it. The choreography of the sword-fights might not be the best, and the black+white photography is a drawback in the action scenes; but no other movie builds tension more effectively, and without tension, no action scene can be fully appreciated.When I first saw this movie, I had already seen two other samurai movies by Kurosawa. That gave me a superficial familiarity with medieval Japan (as seen by Kurosawa), so that I could focus on the plot, the characters, and the action, without having to worry about the unfamiliar setting. Now I have seen this movie often enough to follow it without subtitles, enjoy the sound of the Japanese dialog (without understanding it), and still know from memory what is going on.The highlights of this movie are the three sword-fights, with Sanjuro, alone, facing overwhelming odds. When the third sword-fight comes, you'll know right away that it's going to be the last. It is a classic western-style showdown, with Sanjuro and the bad guys facing each other on a dusty, wind-swept main street in a Japanese village. When I first saw the set-up, I could not help giggling to myself in eager anticipation; and I was not disappointed. Yet the first sword-fight is perhaps the most impressive, for its explosive violence and the terror that suddenly strikes the heart of Sanjuro's enemies.Having said that, it would be very wrong to conclude that the movie is just an excuse for a few action scenes: the other major theme is the Machiavellian plot to clean up the village. Sanjuro explains this plot early on to the innkeeper: he cannot eliminate all the gangsters single-handed, so he'll set them against each other. The success of this plan depends crucially on persuading the gang leaders that Sanjuro is only interested in the money: if they realized that his goal is to clean up the town, the plot would collapse.This movie was somewhat more enjoyable than The Seven Samurai for me: partly because I saw The Seven Samurai when I was not yet comfortable with the setting in medieval Japan; partly because in this movie the interludes between action scenes are shorter, and the action scenes generally better. However, there cannot be a real comparison, because The Seven Samurai is mostly a study of the title characters, while Yojimbo is more about plot than character development. The seven samurai hardly ever interact with the bad guys, except by violence; Yojimbo lives amongst the bad guys. Ultimately, both movies are masterpieces in different ways."
TheUnknown837-1,"Dec 19, 2009",10/10,"In a way, Clint Eastwood may owe the success of his career (or at least the moment of success in his career) not to director Sergio Leone and a movie called ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but rather to a Japanese movie called ""Yojimbo"" and a man named Akira Kurosawa. For those not familiar with the tale of copyright controversy, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is really an unauthorized remake of ""Yojimbo"", which led Kurosawa to successfully sue Leone for copying his film. Now the heat has since calmed down and Kurosawa admitted he enjoyed ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and considered it a worthy remake. However, comparing the two films, it is obvious: the original is the best.We usually associate the plot of a sneering gun for hire playing the two crime bosses of a town against each other with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but it started with ""Yojimbo."" The only difference is, ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is set in 18th century America, ""Yojimbo"" is post-civil war Japan and the squinting protagonist is a samurai, not a gunfighter. So here we have a ronin (Toshiro Mifune) who wanders into a negligent town that is run by two gangs constantly at war with each other. Seeing a window for opportunity, the samurai who never gives his true name, starts to swap loyalty between the two sides and play them against each other to save the townand put some weight in his pockets.This is a classic samurai tale and one of Akira Kurosawa's best. Clint Eastwood may have immortalized the idea of a man without a name, but Toshiro Mifune as the samurai depicts a textbook example of the character. Mifune is playing the exact opposite of the goofy, deliberately comical character he played in ""Seven Samurai"" and gives a performance that is regularly regarded as one of the best of all time by any actor. In addition, Kurosawa's film is also a milestone for the influence it had not on other Japanese films, but in the Americas and in the Western genre. Many elements that we find commonplace in the Western idiom started here.And the ultimate reason why ""Yojimbo"" works and why it is so influential and popular is because it is two hours of sheer excitement. Kurosawa may have ended his career depicting violence as horrible and gut-wrenching in films such as ""Kagemusha"" (1980) and more notable, ""Ran"" (1985), but here he showed it as being wild and not so harrowing. To some people's dismay, this film may be the one that started the chain of movies that glorified violence, but Kurosawa does it with restraint so that an impression of killing and being killed being scary does make its point toward the end, but only after the nameless ronin has sliced up several people with his katana.""Yojimbo"" is a very well-made action picture that rests somewhere between the extremes of being lighthearted and being dark and poignant. It is a shame that it does not receive so much praise in the West, because after all, half the action pictures of today and a significant number of the Western movies do borrow or homage it in some way.Rating: 4/4"
EvanKevelson,"Jan 31, 2021",8/10,"Sergio Leone's classic Fistful of dollars is almost 100% plagiarized.. I'm surprised he only had to pay 15% see Trivia.
This is more comical with that ""Delayed"" Brother carrying Yojimbo to his escape... but the Western Setting and Clint Eastwood's recovery and return is significantly more climactic. The Enio Marricone music also makes it better executed in addition to all being gunmen but this is a phenomenal film that Sergio ""borrowed"" to make into his first classic Spaghetti Western.
I will say if I had not see a Fistful of dollars many many times, or at all I would not have appreciated this film as much. Ironically he could have attained permission e.g. The magnificent 7/ Vs Seven Samaurai... but the story is based on a 1942 work... so I can see why it got legal."

PeterRoeder,"Jun 15, 2009",8/10,"Just like the masterpiece ""The Seven Samurai"" this is a really powerful movie about a samurai. Like the other movies in this series of Samurai movies it is actually pre-Bruce Lee martial arts movies. As action movies they are excellent and still very relevant today. Mifune is, of course, excellent as the main character which inspired Eastwood's roles in the famous Westerns. As I wrote in my Seven Samurai review, this is really an impressive display of macho power, and Kurosawa's movies also has keen philosophical and psychological insight in the human nature similar to, say, the novels of Dostojevskij. This is a must-see for movie fans. Truly an excellent movie gem."

adamscastlevania2,"Apr 4, 2015",8/10,"(73%) Watching this it's pretty clear to anyone that A fist full of dollars owes almost its entire existence to this Japanese classic. Almost from the very beginning, right down to the performances, direction, and script, this has the feel of a classic Leone western as the guy clearly helped himself to bits and pieces. And he must have figured that he'd largely get away with it because so few western people at the time would have ever actually had the chance to even know about this far-east hit. For anyone interested in classic Asian films, or just classic films in general, this is a must- watch that's well worth tracking down. There's a fair share of action, fun, and sheer entertainment value to be had from this quality, and still watchable first rate winner."

They would sell their own mothers for money. But they encounter hero and everyone get what one deserve - villagers manage to kill each other - and, do they take all the possessions with them to heaven, oh sorry, hell? This village is a literal comparison to our world - it doesn't matter how much time passes by, people wouldn't change a bit. The movie shows the world in its radiant gloom with so little conscious, sincerity, trust and sympathy in it.

This is another Kurasawa/Mifune collaboration, Mifune has acted in Kurasawa movies like Seven Samurai, Throne of Blood and Rashomon.The movie's star is Sanjuro (Mifune), he is a sword for hire. His loyalty lies where the money lies. He is willing to kill to show his worth. Mifune does o wonderful job portraying this character. He is calm, funny and of course Badass.I love the black & white cinematography. There is something really appealing about black & white movies. The contrasts between night and day, foreground and background, action and reaction are quite clear. You can often see it in a single shot.This movie inspired the unofficial remake: Fistful of Dollars. I love Fistful and Yojimbo, but i think that Yojimbo is better. There are definitely things that Fistful does better, most notably the music. However I believe that Yojimbo will resonate with me longer.Awesome movie, see it."

It came on at about 10 in the morning on a Saturday, and I stopped because the film looked so distinctive. The widescreen, the black and white, and Toshiro Mifune just looked so cool standing there. It wasn't far into the movie, but after being mesmerized by what I had seen I immediately looked online to where I could buy it (in widescreen, of course, which was not a given back then) and watched it about ten times within a week.Not long after I discovered Sanjuro and all of the rest of the Kurosawa/Mifune masterpieces. It's truly amazing to watch this and notice how current it feels, how the pacing is perfect, how funny it is, how sudden the violence takes place, and the overwhelming sense of danger that constantly envelops the entire film.It's brilliant, it's fun, and it's always entertaining, it's simply a masterpiece of filmmaking."
anjumshahriar,"May 2, 2020",8/10,"One of the best work of Kurosaw, pace was good not the best story though."
naoqueroternomeok,"Feb 13, 2023",9/10,"This is a film that I would really call almost perfect. It is, yes, a masterpiece, though. The pace of the film, the story, the technical side, script, everything was going well, as if the purpose was really to be this - an almost perfect film. It never ventures to try to be more than that - in fact, it has a few breaks in pace, yes, leaving it kind of boring, but that eventually regained its quality and eventually surpassed it a bit. But the point is that Yojimbo is just that. It's a solid film, but not solid in its mediocrity, solid in its perfection or solid in ""just good"" , but rather, in this ""grade 9"" state. It is one of the best films of all time, but it is also ""just one more"" of the best films of all time."
CinemaClown,"Mar 31, 2014",N/A,"Set in 19th century Japan, Yojimbo tells the tale of a wandering samurai who arrives at a rural town that's been torn apart by daily massacres carried out by the two criminal gangs living on opposite sides. Sensing an opportunity to make some money as well as to free the town from daily oppression, he decides to play one side off against the other while the two rival bosses try to hire him as their bodyguard but his plan is soon complicated by the arrival of one of the gangsters' son, who wields a revolver.Directed by the legendary filmmaker, Akira Kurosawa, Yojimbo still hasn't aged a day & remains one of the most influential treasures of world cinema. Kurosawa's direction is absolutely top-notch, cinematography captures the plot events in sharp focus, editing paces the story excellently but it's Toshirô Mifune's bravura performance that makes this film such an emotionally-charged ride. There are also moments of well-timed humour plus the music makes its presence felt at the right moments too.On an overall scale, Yojimbo is a wonderfully crafted period drama that further elevates the craftsmanship of a master storyteller & benefits greatly from a strong, disciplined & impressive lead performance. It being still able to amaze & entertain even after having been imitated so many times is a testament to its greatness & ageless appeal and for the fine balance it presents over its drama, action & entertainment, Yojimbo is a must for cinema lovers around the world."
imdbfan-4248630157,"Apr 1, 2025",N/A,"The director opts for a minimalist approach, using a cold, desaturated color palette, many static shots, and natural lighting. This choice creates a sense of realism, making you feel like part of the character's world. The editing is slow-paced, allowing each scene to breathe. Instead of relying on special effects or forced dramatic moments, the film builds tension subtly through visual details and well-placed silences.Story and ScreenplayThe plot follows a protagonist caught in a complex situation, with answers unfolding gradually. The film carefully develops its mystery, keeping the audience engaged as crucial details emerge over time. The dialogue is sparse but powerful, with every line serving a specific purpose. There's a subtlety in how information is revealed, keeping you intrigued until the very end.One of the screenplay's biggest strengths is how it explores themes of morality, choices, and consequences. The characters are layered and imperfect, avoiding the typical ""good vs. Evil"" clichés. Some actions are justifiable only from a personal perspective, prompting the audience to reflect on their own beliefs."

jungol,"Oct 15, 2002",N/A,"""A Fistful of Dollars"" was released 3 years AFTER ""Yojimbo"", which goes to say the the Sergio Leone picture was an uncredited lift of Kurosawa's masterpiece. Not only that, ""Yojimbo"" was remade again in the nineties as Walter Hill's ""Last Man Standing"", starring Bruce Willis in this gangster era tribute to Kurosawa's true topic inspiring the metaphorical statement of this darkly satiric piece; the rising of organized crime(Yakusa) and its influence over contemporary Japan's economy.Often heralded as Kurosawa's best photographed film (with ""Rashomon"" DP Migawa), this 1870's era tale of a wandering Samourai's meandering's in a small silk/gambling community's struggle for control is easily considered a must-see for not only Kurosawa fans, but for anyone considering themselves true fans of the art of cinema. Not to mention that it was also cool enough of a movie to jet-propel Clint Eastwood's Spagetti Westerns career.Another stellar performance from Toshiro Mifune as the master swordsman, and worldwide acclaim for this film resulted in a sequel, ""Sanjuro""(1962)."

Ben_Cheshire,"Feb 6, 2004",9/10,"If you ever watched Pulp Fiction and thought: movie cool was born here, or maybe you saw any single Sergio Leone movie and thought: this guy invented movie-cool (if you haven't, i thoroughly recommend it - Kill Bill is nothing to his Good, the Bad and the Ugly or Once Upon a Time in the West), then experience Yojimbo, or The Bodyguard. Kurosawa's camera sits behind Toshiro Mifune's man-with-no-name, inviting us to look up at the back of his head as he walks the earth, inviting us to be in awe of this man. And as he walks, super-cool walking-the-earth music plays. Later on, when he's taunted and asked to prove himself, he slices a guy's arm off and plays the petty, money-grabbing rival factions in the town he wanders into off each other.If you have it in your mind that a guy called Kurosawa couldn't make movies that would impress you, that the cultural gap would be too great - be assured that Kurosawa's movies are rife with Western values. Sure, they are rife with Japanese values (i am told), but Kurosawa had a great appreciation of Western culture. He based many of his movies on Western texts, like Shakespeare, Dostoyevsky, or American gangster fiction and film. Yojimbo is one of the latter - inspired by the Dashiell Hammet novel Red Harvest (Hammett's novel The Maltese Falcon was put onscreen moment for moment by John Huston in the movie of the same name which immortalised Humphrey Bogart).Actually, the history of the story of the lone wolf, the wanderer with a weapon, who rides into town to play off two warring factions against each other - is quite a story itself. Dashiell Hammett, an American, wrote a novel with an American private eye as the stranger. In 1961, Akira Kurosawa transposed this story to medieval Japan, after the fall of a dynasty, where a Samurai finds himself with no place to go (at the beginning, we see him throw a branch up in the air and walk the direction it falls), and no master to serve. A bodyguard with no-one to protect. In 1964, Sergio Leone transposed the screenplay of Yojimbo (nearly word for word) to the spanish desert, and he brought along a young television actor named Clint Eastwood, and together they revolutionised the western with Fistfull of Dollars, and created an entire genre, the Spaghetti Western, which sported among its attributes a gritty, desolate landscape, and a cynical, postmodern lack-of-values ideology (traditional American westerns had quite plush landscapes and were always black and white (good and evil) in their value system. Despite the massive influence of Fistfull of Dollars, it pales in comparison to both its predecessor Yojimbo, and its sequals, For a Few Dollars More and The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But still, both Yojimbo and Fistful are iconic movies, and very cool movies.With cool music, a cool anti-hero, a fun script, and a visually spectacular canvas of an image, painted by the eye of an artist (it is said that Kurosawa storyboarded his movies in full-scale paintings), Yojimbo is one of the coolest movies ever made."
elvircorhodzic,"Apr 13, 2017",9/10,"YOJIMBO is an action drama about a rōnin who finds himself at the center of a conflict between the two crime lords.A hungry and tired rōnin wanders through a desolate Japanese countryside. Soon, he arrives in a small town. A local caterer advises him to leave because, two local clans fight every day on the streets. However, a stranger decides to stay. The situation in a town is very good for one rōnin. This is a good chance that he earns some money. However, he does not need a bloody money. He wants to destroy local crime lords...This tense story is full of lies, doubt, turning, pranks, blackmails and excellent fights. A careless and seemingly insensitive samurai is actually a peaceful and good man. Mr. Kurosawa has, under the influence of a western and noir, made a very exciting and visually impressive film. Of course, he has not neglected the significant situations that are related to the Japanese culture and tradition.Close-ups, almost perfectly, reflect an evil, arrogance, fear, invincibility and contempt on faces of some of the protagonists. There is a large number of villains, which are quite different in character.Toshiro Mifune (Kuwabatake Sanjuro) is a resourceful, interesting and determined as a wandering rōnin and master swordsman. He, apparently, enjoys in his machinations, however, his goal is extremely benevolent. He's kind of a lone hero, regardless of a tactical evil and theatrical swagger in his character.His support are Tatsuya Nakadai as Unosuke a wild and insolent gunslinger and the biggest threat to a samurai. He is interesting because he is a completely different character from Sanjuro. Kyū Sazanka (Ushitora) and Seizaburo Kawazu (Seibei) are fairly inconclusive as crime lords. However their primary relationship ""of a teacher and his student"", could be interesting. Isuzu Yamada as Orin is the the wife of Seibei. She is perhaps an initiator of conflicts. Daisuke Katō as Inokichi is a visually the most memorable character. A character, who is capable to commit a vicious murder, but also make the greatest stupidity.Simply, Mr. Kurosawa has managed to combine several styles in a small masterpiece."
Tigereyes,"Nov 11, 2001",N/A,"If I had to choose only one movie for film students to learn from, this would be it. Other films may be more profound, or their imagery more groundbreaking, but this one is so tightly constructed that nothing - not a frame, word, or gesture - is extraneous.Toshiro Mifune, one of the world's most charismatic actors, is perfection as a tough loner of a samurai who takes it upon himself to clean up a town corrupted by two gambling clans. Swirling through and around him is a story that is both technically flawless and profoundly moving.Kurosawa meticulously infuses every detail with meaning; there's a purpose behind every shot, and aspiring directors should pay close attention (why is the camera slightly tilted? why are there concubines in the background?). His economy of style was never more amazing; watch as the samurai rides into town, and the director establishes the atmosphere with exactly one jaw-dropping shot. And the story is equally well-crafted, with no plot holes and no inconsistencies.A wonderful tale that rolls beautifully from start to finish. See it, see it, see it!!"
Peach-2,"Sep 26, 1999",10/10,"Only a handful of directors know atmosphere the way Akira Kurosawa does, only a handful. Yojinbo opens with a tracking shot of a ronin samurai walking down a dusty road. The camera wisely stays behind the samurai, played by Toshiro Mifune, so we cannot see his face or expressions. This samurai is desperate. Mifune has no master and no money. Kurosawa doesn't let you see his desperation, instead focusing on the back of his head and his profile to set up one of the most memorable characters in cinema history. The film has been copied many times, its practically the most influential film of the modern action genre. Yojinbo isn't action packed however, Kurosawa takes his time setting up characters and plot. The fact that this masterless samurai has deep compassion for strangers is different than most modern action movies alone. Toshiro Mifune is magical in the lead role. His presence is felt all throughout the film even when he isn't on camera. All film buffs should watch this film, it is a perfect example of a director and actor with confidence in their craft."
faraaj-1,"Oct 17, 2006",10/10,"Yojimbo, based on noir writer Dashiel Hammett's Red Harvest is a magnificently entertaining film. Toshiro Mifune stars as the nobody who calls himself Sanjuro (thirty but closer to forty). He enters a town destroyed by warring factions and plays a double-game to pit one faction against the other thus destroying the criminal element.Yojimbo (aka The Bodyguard) is one of the coolest and most stylish films ever made. Starring Toshiro Mifune, Kurosawa's favorite actor, as the scruffy looking Samurai, Yojimbo has all of Kurosawa's qualities and none of the flaws. The music score is an essential element of the plot and strikingly good, but admittedly bettered by the Ennio Morricone version in the Spaghetti Western remake Fistful of Dollars. The visuals are great, from the samurai swordplay, to the desolate streets, the town crier announcing its 3 a.m. to the brutal torture scene.One of the unique things about Yojimbo is the central character. He is an anti-hero. We see him initially as a killer and a man greedy for money. But then, he saves a family by re-uniting mother and child and giving them all the money he was advanced. Mifune has never been cooler than in this film and Eastwood could only aspire to equal such a performance.Of the two remakes, I liked Fistful of Dollars for starting the Spaghetti Western genre, although Yojimbo is a far more superior and stylish film. The gangster version, Last Man Standing, was not very good and Bruce Willis made for a poor substitute to Yojimbo. This film looks fresh and undated even today - watch it!"
funkyfry,"Nov 9, 2002",10/10,"Classic samurai action pic; often imitated but never equalled.  Mifune creates a memorable character (who appeared in a sequel) in the Ronin who decides the course of his life on the toss of a stick, and ends up risking his life to save a village full of peasants he finds revolting.  It's possible to see ""Yojimbo's"" actions as either heroic or as the game of a bored warrior in need of amusement -- as often in Kurosawa's films, the fact that the characters' motives remain open to interpretation adds depth to the film.Wonderful images, and skillful direction that keeps the pace of the storytelling tight and tells most of the story through images -- this is the kind of film that is so good it can be watched a silent film without losing too much of its impact or meaning.I think that if Kurosawa had spent more of his time in litigation and less making movies, he might have made a living for the rest of his life off all the movies that have ripped off this movie.  Certainly Eastwood's ""Man with No Name"" character owes a lot to Mifune's contribution; not only in Leone's films (the first of which borrows its entire plot from Kurosawa; a court settlement ensued which made sure Kurosawa made most of the profits from ""Fistful of Dollars"" in Asia his own) but also in Eastwood's best film as a director -- ""High Plains Drifter"", which borrows scenes such as Eastwood's rebuke of the villagers from ""Yojimbo"".The really funny thing about all this, and what not too many American critics or audiences have noted, is that ""Yojimbo"" is itself a western.  All the ingredients for a western are here, and the film's plot and style obviously owe a debt to Zinnemann's ""High Noon"".  ""Yojimbo"" even borrows the device of time, setting up a confrontation at 3:00 a.m. as shouted by the town crier.  I like ""Yojimbo"" better than ""High Noon"", so I don't want to go too far into this line of thought...."
InzyWimzy,"Oct 28, 2002",10/10,"I just figured out why Toshirô Mifune is so mesmerizing to watch.  It's just the way he expresses himself.  This guy's amazing!I've been exploring the halls of Kurosawa and it's getting hard to leave. Yojimbo is a FUN film to watch.  Toshiro as the samurai steals almost every scene he is in and I think the epitome of his character  is when he's in Gonji's place lying on the floor.  He doesn't brag, but when he goes into action, that's it!  As soon as he enters the chaotic town, he doesn't seem fazed at all and actually enjoys it.  His  demeanor is really amusing and it's great watching his plan unfold;   how he manipulates both groups to get his way (it's really funny).  Great thing too is he's not really a hero and he's not entirely a villain.  He doesn't hesitate to kill, but does so methodically.  You also have ""characters"" including Gonji, the thugs from both sides, and Unosuke with an ace up his sleeve (or robe?) which makes things really interesting.Yojimbo's mix of dark humor, action, and a great performance from Mifune make for a Kurosawa classic."
OttoVonB,"Sep 17, 2002",10/10,"After a string of classic masterpieces, Kurosawa confronted his influences head-on. Throwing John Ford's Western aesthetics into a blender and painting them pitch black. The results are Yojimbo and its legacy.Yojimbo (""the bodyguard"") is the tale of a flea-ridden wandering swordsman, Sanjuro (Toshiro Mifune, in his finest performance). He arrives at a gang-war ravaged town and starts hiring himself out to both sides, playing them off against another, in order to wipe all the scum out. Sound familiar?Even though Yojimbo the film is a thrilling ride and very funny dark comedy, it is hard to imagine what a bombshell this was for audiences at the time of its release. It is as far removed as can be from the then squeaky-clean aesthetic of samurai films: you can almost smell the sweat and the grime of the sordid town and characters. The action is fast and furious, enhanced by Kurosawa's deft use of telephoto lenses and Masaru Sato's avant-garde score. With all that, Yojimbo was a massive kick in the pants of a fossilized genre.It exploded beyond the confines of its own country and genre, forever influencing the very Westerns that had inspired it, particularly a new wave out of Spain and Italy at the time. One Sergio Leone copy/pasted the whole plot into his own revisionist Western and gave us the Dollars trilogy. The slightest of Spaghetti Western enthusiasts owes Kurosawa a debt of gratitude.As with all truly great work, its greatness exists even devoid of context, and for all the historical precedents it set, all Kurosawa wanted to make was an entertaining film. That he bloody well succeeded is the least you can say about Yojimbo."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 18, 2020",7/10,"You'd be forgiven for thinking that 'Yojimbo (1961)' is familiar if you've already seen 'A Fistful Of Dollars (1964)'; Leone's western is pretty much a shot for shot remake of the Kurasowa classic. Its long stretches of silence before a duel, its grimacing faces of weather-worn goons and its brief flashes of stylish violence all clearly inspired the design of the entire 'Dollars' trilogy. This is only really relevant to the experience of 'Yojimbo (1961)' if you watch the two movies in reverse (as it were), as they really are almost identical in narrative and tone. It's a good thing, then, that they're about as good as one another. This samurai story sees a nameless wanderer work his way between two feuding gang bosses, making as much money as possible and maybe just saving the people who really matter along the way. Mifune's protagonist is a bit of a blank slate, his underlying morals hidden behind a facade of unflinching toughness. For as good as he is with a blade, he rarely has to use it. This lack of action isn't a problem, however, as it simply makes the few fights there are all the more impactful. They're fast, frenetic and dirty, stained with beautifully shot black-and-white blood. There's a coldness about the killing that mightn't sit right with a good chunk of the audience and that's a valid criticism. Still, the thing moves fast enough that no cruelty is ever lingered on, focused on delivering a tight and engaging plot right from the start. It's an entertaining film, even if it isn't as deep or emotionally impactful as some of Kurosawa's other work. It's carefully crafted and stands the test of time, too. 7/10"
Platypuschow,"Oct 21, 2018",6/10,"At time of writing Yojimbo presently sits as the 115th highest rated movie on IMDB, it's not the only one of Tohos movies in there either.

In a bid to save the town he plays mind games with them both in an effort to get them to kill one another off.The plot is simple but well handled, the film looks the part and it's character development is great. As if that wasn't enough we have legendary director Akira Kurosawa behind the camera and Toshirô Mifune in front of it. Mifune is great and is on form here, but is it just me or does he always play essentially the same character?I wasn't that keen on the films finale, I also felt that it dragged in places but regardless is a watchable Toho effort and a must watch for fans of the genre.Enjoyable but top 250?

FilmOtaku,"Jul 7, 2005",5/10,"""Yojimbo"", Japanese for ""bodyguard"" is the story of Sanjuro Kuwabatake, (Mifune) a samurai without a master or anyone to protect who walks into a small Japanese village that is rife with violence caused by two feuding groups. The boss of each group tries to hire Sanjuro, who decides to solve the village's issues by pitting one side against another. Problems arise for Sanjuro when the son of one of the bosses shows up, who brandishes a gun and absolutely is not afraid to use it.""Yojimbo"" was later remade into ""A Fist Full of Dollars"", featuring Clint Eastwood, and the similarities are certainly prevalent, particularly with their respective ""heroes"". Mifune, a great actor who is able to be extremely expressive without the benefit of a lot of dialogue, is once again excellent in this film. The story itself is a good one, and the film was entertaining overall. I fear, however, that I may have either tried to watch too much Kurosawa in a short period of time, or that I may have seen his three best too early, because there wasn't a lot that excited me in this film as opposed to say, ""The Seven Samurai"", ""Rashomon"" or ""High and Low"". At times the film seemed to drag a little, and Unosuke, the guy with the gun, became kind of a joke because after awhile the way he was acting menacing with his gun was really pretty humorous. I kept thinking about the Simpsons episode when Homer joins the NRA and was using his gun for everything, including turning on the television, and I don't think that was the reaction that Kurosawa intended.I'm not panning the film as a whole; I just think that ""Yojimbo"" is perhaps not one of Kurosawa's great films. Every great director has some films that don't seem to be in the same league as their masterpieces, (though I have yet to watch a Kubrick film that hasn't left me breathless with admiration) and I'm certain that Kurosawa is no exception. Because the film was decent, but not great, I'm giving it a decent, but not great rating  an average 5/10.--Shelly"
Infofreak,"May 15, 2004",N/A,"I'm not going to waste time debating which was the ""greatest"" or ""best"" of Kurosawa's movies, but if you want to know the one I enjoy the most it's 'Yojimbo'. 'Rashomon' and 'Throne Of Blood' are probably deeper and more substantial, but for sheer entertainment value 'Yojimbo' is hard to beat! Being a Kurosawa movie it's no surprise that it stars Toshiro Mifune. The two made many movies together, but this is the performance I like to watch the most. I love looking at Mifune's face! His expressions are awesome. He was without a doubt one of the 20th centuries greatest movie stars. 'Yojimbo' was a massive influence on many spaghetti westerns, specifically 'A Fistful Of Dollars', but before you bay for Sergio Leone's blood, please read Dashiell Hammett's detective classic 'Red Harvest', published in 1929 and you'll see that Kurosawa lifted his plot from it.  I see no mention whatsoever of this source material in the credits for 'Yojimbo', so let's just leave the Leone bashing alone okay? Many people have convincingly argued that samurai movies were inspired by classic American westerns anyway. Walter Hill later ""remade"" 'Yojimbo' (or 'Red Harvest' depending on your perspective) as 'Last Man Standing' and David Lynch gave a small nod to it in his 'Wild At Heart'.  You can certainly see both the samurai and spaghetti influences in Tarantino's 'Kill Bill' 1 and 2, that's for sure. ""Influences"", ""inspirations"", these are things that go around and around, it's what a writer or film maker does with them that counts. 'Yojimbo' is a classic action movie. Maybe only 'Wages Of Fear' is better. Every film buff needs this movie in their collection!"
Witchfinder-General-666,"Jun 6, 2006",10/10,"Akira Kurosawa is widely (and rightly) thought of as one of the most important filmmakers in the history of motion pictures. ""Yojimbo"", one of the masterpieces that have earned him this more than deserved reputation, is not only one of the best, but also one of the most influential movies ever made. Only three years after its release another great director, Sergio Leone, who named Yojimbo one of his favorite movies, used it as the model for another masterpiece, ""A Fistful Of Dollars"" and rose the Italian Western to an international level.In 1860, a time when the sword is still the most common weapon in the Japanese province, but gradually gets replaced by the revolver, a lonely Ronin, a Samurai without a master to serve,(Toshiro Mifune) who dashes around the county, comes to a little town terrorized by two bosses and their criminal gangs and decides to end the people's suffering and free the town. He is hired by one of the gangs as a bodyguard, only to switch sides and pit the two, already hostile, gangs against each other.Toshiro Mifune, one of the greatest character actors of all time, is impressive in his role of the Samurai, generally the acting is great in this movie, the supporting cast contains such actors as the great and unforgettable Takashi Shimura. The cinematography is great and the movie's brilliant score, composed by Fumio Hayasaka, is one of its kind. The writing and directing by the inimitable Akira Kurosawa is more than brilliant. One of the greatest movies by one of the greatest directors of all-time, and an absolute must-see for everyone interested in cinema!"
PureCinema,"Dec 26, 1998",10/10,"Kurosawa's influence in film is most easily recognized in the western. The Seven Samurai was remade in America as The Magnificent Seven, and our next film, Yojimbo was remade almost scene by scene as A Fistful of Dollars.The story takes place in 18th century Japan, a time when Samurai wandered the lands. A lone samurai, Sanjuro Kuwabatake (Toshiro Mifune) drifts into a small town. Soon he discovers that the town is divided into two groups who are constantly fighting with one another. Sanjuro sees this as an easy opportunity to make money by lending his services to both sides, but soon he becomes too much involved and is tossed into prison. After escaping, he sees that the two sides are locked in a fierce battle and decides to end their feud once and for all.Yojimbo was an instant hit across Japan as well as internationally.

freemantle_uk,"Jun 30, 2013",9/10,"Yojimbo is one of Akira Kurosawa's most celebrated films in his career and was remade by Sergio Leone into A Fistful of Dollars. It is considered an essential film and a classic in the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune was excellent as the nameless ronin who sets out to protect the town, being a man of few words. Kurosawa is of course excellent at setting up the conflict in the town and how it affects the people whilst also delivering on fine samurai sword fights (a man even has his hand cut off). Kurosawa wonderfully lets his scenes play out with plenty of long shots and small camera movements. Kurosawa and his actors also inject some occasional moments of humours to help lighten the mood when need be. But for the most Yojimbo is a serious drama with some very dark elements. Out of the Kurosawa films I have seen I personally prefer Seven Samurai for its scale and Rashomon for its ambition, but Yojimbo is still a worthy film and true film buffs need to watch it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 16, 2012",10/10,"Akira Kurasawa is one of my favourite directors as of now. And Yojimbo does nothing to make me change that, if anything like Seven Samurai, Ran, Ikiru, Hidden Fortress, Rashomon and Throne of Blood it is another of his masterpieces. Like Hidden Fortress was a major influence on Star Wars, Yojimbo did the same for Fistful of Dollars. I've seen them compared a lot, but all I will say that for me both are milestones of their respective genres and both are movies to watch if not done so already. Back to Yojimbo, as always for a Kurasawa film, it is superbly made and made absolutely beautifully with epic scenery and great, stylish use of camera techniques. The music adds much to the story, and is remarkably atmospheric, the script is a fine mix of comedy, intrigue and sudden and quite unrelenting violence and the story is compelling and always entertaining, managing to both celebrate and subvert(but in a subtle way) the samurai genre. Toshiro Mifune I have yet to see a bad performance from, and again he is a superb lead, who could be seen as an anti-hero as he sells his skills yet dupes both sides of the feudal community into slaughter. Overall, another fantastic film from perhaps the King of Japanese cinema. 10/10 Bethany Cox"

There is a massacre , but the samurai runs away with the help of the innkeeper ; but while recuperating at a nearby temple, he learns of an abduction carried out by Unosuke, and goes back to the town to take on enemies .This is a magnificent picture by Akira Kurosawa starred by his ordinary actor Toshiro Mifune , being his international breakthrough one . Yokimbo , the picture blends drama , violent fights , emotion , slaughters with high body-count and results to be pretty entertaining as well as thought provoking . It is incredibly detailed vision in its own right , as the impact of the action and combats on this trail-blazing adventure film opened the floodgates for the huge numbers of samurai films and subsequent Spaghetti Westerns that made fortunes for their producers in the sixties and early seventies . Dramatically staged sword-plays occur on and off throughout the plot . The known film Leone¨For a fistful of dollars¨is mainly cribbed from this Japanese samurái action classic ; however , some reviewers tell this Yojinbo bears little resemblance to Sergio Leone film . Very good acting by Toshiro Mifune as a Samurái who attempts to play the two warlords off against each other . This one made an international star out of Toshiro Mifune . At the beginning , Sanjuro seems to be a good Samurai , as being beaten after he reunites an abducted woman with her husband and son, then massacres his father's opponents. As well as Tatsuya Nakadai , still acting , as Unosuke, the son of one of the gangsters, who owns a revolver.This fiercely-charging , uncompromising pictures was compellingly directed by Akira Kurosawa and being exhibited with subtitles or dubbed .After working in a wide range of genres, Kurosawa made this awesome film . The previous years saw the low-key , touching Living (1952) , the epic The seven samurais (1954), the barbaric , fascinating Shakespeare adaptation Throne of blood (1957) , a Macbeth's version , a masterful rendition that transports the story to Medieval Japan , and a fun pair of samurai movies Yojimbo (1961) and Sanjuro (1962) , and Rashomon , often credited as the reason the Academy created the ""Best Foreign Film"" category. When this film was released internationally to rave reviews, many speculated that Akira Kurosawa was influenced by Citizen Kane (1941) in the element of flashbacks that ultimately provide conflicting accounts of events. However, Kurosawa didn't even see Orson Welles's film until several years after . Rashomon won the top prize at the Venice Film Festival, and first revealed the richness of Japanese cinema to the West.Yet , there was a quieter side to Kurosawa's nature , expressed most succinctly on Living , The Lower Depths and especially the medical drama Red Beard . After a lean period in the late 1960s and early 1970s, though, Kurosawa attempted suicide . Other important movies were : The idiot based on Feodor Dostowieski , Drunken Angel , Scandal , A quiet duel , Tiger's tale , High and low . He survived, and made a small, personal, low-budget picture with Dodes'ka-den (1970), a larger-scale Russian co-production Dersu Uzala (1975) an epic tale of adventure in turn-of-the-century Siberia and , with the help of admirers Francis Ford Coppola and George Lucas, the samurai tale Kagemusha (1980), which Kurosawa described as a dry run for Ran (1985), an epic adaptation of Shakespeare's ""King Lear"" . He continued to work into his eighties with the more personal Akira Kurosawa's Dreams (1990), and Madadayo (1993) and Rhapsody in August . Kurosawa's films have always been more popular in the West than in his native Japan, where reviewers have viewed his adaptations of Western genres and authors with suspicion , but he's revered by American and European film-makers, one of his least well-known films but most agreeable pictures is The Bad Sleep Well , a transposition of an Ed McBain detective novel , being remade many his pictures such as The seven samurais (1954), as The magnificent seven (1960),The Hidden Fortress (1958), as Star Wars (1977)as Yojimbo (1961) as For a fistful of dollars by Sergio Leone (1964), in fact Kurosawa's style was the biggest single influence on the Spaghetti Western sub-genre ; as his Samurai 'Western's were copied not only in America but also in Italy ."
raoul-guariguata,"Sep 21, 2006",10/10,"Well, I'm a great Toshiro Mifune fan and for that, this is one of the movies you have to watch. This Kurosawa story was remade by Sergio Leone as a Fistful of Dollars and Walter Hill's Last Man Standing. It was one of the first action flicks ever made; and for the first time presented the nameless action hero, who comes to town to set it free. He is always cool, always confident and a master of his skills, loves drinks and takes outs his enemies in a second. The acting of Mifune is superb and his figure inspired Clint Eastwood to stick a cigarette in his jaw just for the coolness factor in the old western movies (Mifune chewed on straw). I don't think Western action cinema and the representation of the main ""hero"" would have developed in the fashion they did, if Mifune never would have worked together with Kurosawa. Their influence is definitely large."
