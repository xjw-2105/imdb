NRGWasp,"May 2, 2002",10/10,"Simply incredible. Never before have I seen a 3 hour movie that didn't seem like 3 hours. I read the Lord of the Rings very recently and I was surprised at how similar Peter Jackson's vision was to my own.Now about the omissions and alterations. I'm not a crazed fanatic who gets worked up over every little detail. I didn't mind Arwen's inflation and I'm actually glad Tom Bombadil was scrubbed (I felt Tom Bombadil was an unnecessary addition to the book). Despite these minor changes, the screenplay stays extremely close to the book and flows very very well (and the prologue was a nice touch).The acting was flawless. As I've read many many times in other reviews, McKellen doesn't play Gandalf, he IS Gandalf. Wood, Mortensen, Holm, Astin, everyone was fantastic. My hat's off to Sean Bean who delivers an excellent performance as Boromir, a character who's intentions are good but wrestles with the corrupting power of the Ring. Bean portrays it VERY well. Oh, and Andy Serkis does a PERFECT Gollum voice. It's EXACTLY as I imagined it myself.The special effects were incredible, the cave troll, the balrog, Gollum, and Sauron's Eye all looked amazing. I was also very impressed by the seamless shrinking of the vertically challenged characters.What's wrong with this movie? I have no idea... I thought everything was perfect. MY biggest gripe is having to wait an entire year to see The Two Towers!"
adamscastlevania2,"Nov 11, 2014",10/10,"(95%) If the late 70's early 80's had the Star wars trilogy, then the 2000's had this epic fantasy masterclass. Regardless of whether you're a fantasy fan or not this is too good a movie to simply pass up, and it will be one of those movies that given time will prove it to be a classic. The deeper you look into this the more one notices that every single aspect really is a truly impressive accomplishment. The fact that every single sword used by the main characters was made by hand, with extra ones made only for carrying, fighting, etc, then there's the costumes/armor/props all made by teams of many people. They even made artificial trees for gods sake. But really all those things are just extras, what really makes this a unique watch is that it really does feel huge and sweeping, the sense of scale is fantastic and I can't think of anything that even comes close to matching it. What every epic flick needs this has, the cast is great, it's exciting, it has bags of character, it's funny, sad, superbly well made, with a great score and plenty of action. It's also one of very few 2 hour 30 minute + movies ever that leaves the audience wanting more. Since watching it around Christmas 2001 at a packed out cinema, and the many times I've seen it on DVD since, it never fails to impress and charm. All in all near perfect cinematic treat that keeps on giving."
bonnie91,"Apr 14, 2006",10/10,"The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J.R.R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"

Enthrals anew every time

minionlost,"Dec 11, 2001",N/A,"Breathtaking.  Unique.  Captivating.  Enchanting.Within minutes of the start of this first chapter of an undeniably epic trilogy, the audience was left gasping at the intensity of the images on the screen.  And we had nearly three hours to go.The scope of Tolkien's masterpiece may have eluded film-makers for decades, but director Peter Jackson makes good on his promise: he has not only brought us the tale of Frodo and his bold companions, he has brought us Middle Earth.  And believe me, it is BIG.  Sweeping vistas and hang-onto-your-seat camera shots send us zooming through the towering cities and citadels of Tolkien's imagination.But even more impressive than the stunning visuals and sound-effects-like-you've-never-heard-before are the actors who breathe life into the characters.  Ian McKellen's portrayal of Gandalf is nothing short of awe-inspiring, and Elijah Wood's Frodo is one of the most unexpectedly captivating performances I've seen in a long time.  The despair, terror, and determination of the Fellowship is all there, in spades.  I left the theater aching...from tensing every muscle during the fight and flight sequences--the breathless and compelling kind we haven't seen since Spielberg gave us a desperate charge onto the D-Day beaches of Normandy.Those unfamiliar with Tolkien's world may quickly find themselves lost in it, but happily so.  The depth of his creation cannot be grasped in a few hours, and it doesn't need to be; the struggle of good against evil explodes on the screen, and leaves little room for complaint.The movie ended with a stunned audience sitting on the edges of their seats, feeling somewhat bereft.  We were exhausted, but no one wanted to wait a year for more.Jackson's ambitious first chapter is truly unlike anything you've seen this year.  George Lucas and Chris Columbus take note: this is how you deliver on a cinematic promise.For everyone else: don't you dare miss it."
0U,"Feb 15, 2020",10/10,"It is my firm belief that the standard versions of The Lord of the Rings should be jettisoned in favour of the extended editions universally. Sure, the near 4 hour runtime is a tad steep, but for an absolute masterpiece like this, it's work every second and the first act of undoubtedly the best trilogy in cinematic history!"
Nachtritter,"Jan 30, 2002",10/10,"...but oh was I thankful for it!!! All through the movie I kept on having this big large smile sculpted into my face. For the record, I'm 25 years old, and I've read ""The Lord of the Rings"" in three times for the first time when I was six or seven years old. Ever since then, I read it at least once or twice a year - therefore you can count me as a fan, for I follow the same cult fan procedure with ""The Hobbit"" and ""The Silmarillion"" as well. Now onto the movie... Gosh, I saw it more than one time, and I keep wanting more of it. It just never gets boring! I really enjoyed the little stuff that is found throughout the movie for fans of the books (the map on Bilbo's table in his house comes to mind, it is exactly as the one in ""The Hobbit"" book that I own), and I also incredibly enjoyed the intro sequence with the re-telling of the battle against Sauron from the Silmarillion, never has an ultimate evil being been so well depicted on the screen. It truly is Sauron.Those who argue the movie cuts too many parts or that it changes the story too much are totally wrong. This movie could not have shown the whole first time in its entirety - keep in mind that the audiobook version of 'Fellowship of the Ring' lasts well over ten hours, making a movie this long would, well, make it way too long and besides, how would you financially sustain such a project? I've read a reviewer saying he'd make all three books with the time allowed for the first movie alone. I think it would be a very fast-forwarding experience of a movie with 'Alvin and the Chimpmunks' kind of voices, incredibly stupid to say the least.Ok, so there are changes in the movie - well, this is Jackson's vision of it. All of us have our own visions of the books, which may or may not be compatible with that of Jackson's, but I can safely assume that nobody can say they have a hundred percent the same vision of the story as Tolkien; that's the thing with books: each reader has a different vision of it. As for me, I was blown away. Never before have I felt so much at home in a movie, it is as if I had taken a walk in the town where I grew up, the Shire, Rivendell, Moria, Lorien, everything felt so much like home, I was moved. I cannot tell of another movie that had me shed tears just by seeing a landscape on screen.As for the changes, well, I found good reasons behind all of them, and let me tell you right away, I was happy that Arwen saved Frodo, yes, maybe coming from a fan it will look like absolute heresy, but I enjoyed the scene a lot. I did not enjoy it because it was supposedly politically-correct to do so, or that I find Liv Tyler to be absolutely attractive; it was just because I felt like even though it was a big change from the book, it was a very good one indeed, it makes you discover the power, determination, and courage of elves and the fact that even elven women, although great in their beauty and seemingly fragile in appearance do not have anything to envy to their male counterparts. And beside, as Arwen is to become a Queen later on, it was pretty good to see her have a great first appearance.The actors were great, they were a lot into their characters, and for the first time, I saw elves as they were, quick, agile, terrifyingly effective in battle - just look at how Legolas dealed with the hordes of enemies without a single hint of fear in his eyes - these are elves as they should be. Gimli was great too, I know people seem to think many characters were not developed enough, but by the actions you can learn a lot. With Gimli a lot can be learned about the dwarves, their pride, deep sense of honor and family, their mistrust of elves, their love for strong beer and a good fight against anything bigger, and their sheer hatred for orcs and the likes. Aragorn was totally the ranger character, the ending scene as he walked toward the horde of Uruk-Hai warriors was great, his attitude, his clothes, everything about him just cried ""ranger"". Boromir was very well depicted, desperate to save the people of Gondor, by any mean necessary, robbed of all hope, yet in the end he redeems himself by showing his true valour, deep down, he's willing to die to defeat evil, and when he recognizes his king in Aragorn, on his last breath, I felt like watching a hero die, it was moving. The hobbits were all great, Frodo is deeply sad and fatalist, and Sam is just the 'best friend' everyone would like to have, just as it should be. Finally, we have Gandalf, quite frankly, he looks mighty, Ian IS Gandalf. The faceoff against the Balrog in the Moria is a memorable sequence, and just shows how strong he really is, to be able to vanquish such a foe. I can't wait for his return.Quite frankly, I can't wait for the two other movies... In the meantime, I'll watch this one over and over again. This movie has everything that a good movie needs to have, and more. Plus, it just might bring more people to actually read books that have more pages than the average little 25¢ novel that has no value in it, which is great. Parents, maybe some scenes will frighten your kids, but this movie has almost NO blood (even though it has a good share of battle) and the foes are undeniably evil, plus it has good values in it - friendship, courage, responsiblity, sacrifice for a good cause, and the belief that anyone can help to change things. This is worthy of Tolkien, this is a movie that will go down in history as being one of the best ever, for sure."
david-meldrum,"Apr 26, 2022",10/10,"It's possible we've become too familiar with this film and its two successors. Time, and multiple rewatching as, can cause us to forget how impossible the whole project seemed before the world saw it; we forget how strange and independent spirited parts of it are; we forget the references too and evidence of Jackson's roots in horror cinema; we forget the narrative excitement that propels a film adapted from a source that is more discursive, more of a scene-setter. Changes made from the text aid this, and the result is thrilling and wonder-inducing. It's a masterful piece of epic fantasy cinema, and the whole trilogy's place in my heart is secure."
TheOtherFool,"Jul 20, 2004",6/10,"First off, I'd like to make a statement: I have not read any of the LOTR books by Tolkien. I once started out in The Hobbit, but didn't think much of it. So I'd like to review the Movie, and will not relate it to the book. So I don't care if Middle Earth 'came to life' to some viewers, or if the Orks really had 3 eyes or whatever. I don't care about that.Let's start with a view at the story. A ring that has the power to destroy the world falls into the hands of young Frodo (Wood), who with help of several friends has to destroy it on a special place. The first movie of the trilogy basically are these people on their journey to that place.And that's it. I don't care where that place is, which member of the Fellowship really is the son of whom, what is going to happen in the next movies or whatever. This is the open ended story presented, and it's really not that interesting. Way too many (unimportant) characters are involved, the movie is lacking in story and pace and isn't as epic as a lot of people (mostly fans of the book), make you believe it is.If you analyze it, the movie goes like this: Group of people taking a journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey. Have a fight. Lose a guy. Continue journey, etcetera, etcetera. These fights might be against different enemies (Orks, Uru-kai, a huge monster or black knights), it all comes down to the same thing. And that, to be honest, is a bit boring.The worst part though is that when Lotr:Fotr finally does finish, nothing has really happened. They're still on their journey, still losing guys and I'm sure they're gonna have a lot more fights in the other 2 films, of which I already saw The Two Towers. Is it really necessary to expand an easy (mind you, I didn't say bad) story to a 9 hour movie extravaganza? For instance, is Cate Blanchetts character really of importance to the movie? No, the only reason she's in there because she's in the book. And that's a pretty lame reason, since this is Film-making we're talking about.Now, it's not that the Fellowship is a really bad movie. It all looks phenomenal and we have to congratulate Peter Jackson for the fact he got those studio people mad (or, in retrospect, wise) enough to spend so much money on it. We have to respect Tolkien for creating an exciting world, full of imaginative details.But, for the many things Fellowship is (a cool look at the book for fans?), a good movie it most definitely is not. 6/10."
Rinaear,"Oct 8, 2002",N/A,"It is with no surprise that Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring film has received such mixed critics. Many viewers refer to it as being childish, boring and uninteresting. Seems to me that it is bound to the same fate of Tolkien's books, destined to be a target for the same type of misunderstandings that keep attacking this literary masterpiece many decades after it's first publication.Having read the books several years ago, I went to see this `impossible' film when it came out with many doubts on my mind. I really liked it, but left the theater with as many doubts as I had before. Was it perfect? Well, maybe not, but what an achievement. After watching it a few times on DVD, and thinking about it for some time now, I find myself loving this film more and more. Let me tell you why...The Lord of the Rings is a fairy-tale of myth and fantasy. Peter Jackson directed a film that was considered, for a very long time, impossible to make, and not only for technical reasons. The narrative roots are incredibly long and detailed, and the storyline is deeply connected with the creation of a fantastic continent from a time unknown called `Middle Earth'. It's author, Tolkien, dedicated a considerable part of his life developing this continent's background, it's mythology and origins, it's different kinds of people, cultures and languages, and therefore it's geographic references are determinant to the unfolding of the story of the One Ring.Peter Jackson went out to achieve the impossible and came out with a recreation of the original that is pure and true to the story in every detail. The first time the four hobbits meet a black rider on the road, for example, is absolutely faithful to the feeling of the book. The assault of the riders at Weathertop is another great example, and it captures that feeling of danger, density and atmosphere that are the main characteristics of the tale. Jackson also took some liberties with the story, and made some right choices along the way. If the so called `purists' may not approve the removal of Tom Bombadil altogether, it should be comprehensible that the travel from Hobbiton to Rivendel is a very long and detailed one and could easily make a movie on it's own. I felt more uneasy with how short the Council of Elrond was. In the book, the council is where the whole story of the rings is first explained, and many passages from the past ages of Middle Earth are unveiled. It is a fascinating moment of the story, that had to be shortened for obvious reasons. Still, after some consideration, I now agree with the options made by Peter Jackson, and think that the movie prologue narrated by Galadriel was the wisest choice. The magic is all there when Gandalf shuts his eyes the moment Frodo stands in the council and says `I will take the ring'. It is there at Moria's Gate, and at the fall of Boromir. It is a powerful film that doesn't fit the rhythm of the standard Hollywood action movie. It is a film that breeds, that takes time to unfold, it's tale branching in every direction.I could go on and on, talking about all the different elements that bring this film close to perfection, but I'll end saying that deep down, this is not about action, beards and big monsters. The greatest thing about this film, to me, is that it brought me back to a time when I was in love with a different world where everything was possible. Reading The Lord of the Rings night after night, I came to understand what this thing of `mankind' really was all about. The corruption of absolute power, the importance and value of friendship, the inevitability of growing up, the strength of hope... That this film could capture that magic, and be a new bearer to it's message of humanism, is a statement to it's greatness. Gandalf's words, that even the smallest person may change the course of the world, and have a part to play in the destiny of all, are immortal.In the end, this is a wonderful film, but that doesn't mean you are going to like it. I cannot tell you what it is like to see this film if you don't know or love the book. But I hope it may plant a seed on your heart to discover a great world of fantasy, beauty and humanity. I believe Tolkien would have liked that."
Yrneh,"Dec 22, 2001",10/10,"I think it is important to remember that Peter Jackson took up this film not in order just to make a film of `The Lord of the Rings' but because he wanted to make a 'fantasy just like the `The Lord of the Rings'"" as he himself put it.  After repeating that phrase on a number of occasions the question popped into his mind: ""Well, why not the `The Lord of the Rings' itself?"".  In doing this he, of course, set himself an enormous challenge: he had to make a really good `fantasy' film, one which would stand on its own and be true to what he had originally wanted to do but he would also, and here the task he had set himself was enormous, be true to the original book and to make a film which the legions of people who have loved this book would feel happy with.  In the latter task he was certainly not helped by the author or the book: Tolkein, it would seem, hated cinema.  The book itself is `HUGE': this was not going to be the kind of task that the James Ivory team set themselves, or Scorsese nor the kind of task facing Branagh with Hamlet; nor was it going to be like the puny task that faced Columbus with `Harry Potter' who had the bigger budget ($130 million for one film as compared with Peter Jackson with $300m for three).I have just seen the first `volume' and can say without hesitation that he has succeeded in both his goals.  It is not the book but a reading of the book which is inventive and fascinating.  It is the kind of experience that makes you want to go back and reread the whole thing in the light of the emphases that Jackson has brought to the story.  He focuses on the corrupting influence of the ring and, through this focus, the character of the chief protagonists of the story are revealed.  Clearly those most tempted by it are mortal men (Boromir and even, in one moment, Aragorn), those who already have power (Elrond - `The ring cannot stay here'; Galadriel; Gandalf and Saruman),  and, of course, those who would not normally desire it but who by accident become ring bearers - Gollum, Bilbo, Frodo.  I can see why, in this reading, Jackson decided to leave out the Bombadil episode.  Bombadil, like the Balrog, is beyond the ring but the latter is important to the unfolding of the story of the fates of all the characters, Bombadil isn't.It is a miracle of this reading of the first volume of the book that one can see where Jackson is going and one can get a feel of how the reading is going to unfold.  In a sense, Jackson's real trial - as far as those who know the books are concerned - will come with the second film in the series. He has lived up to our expectation by creating even bigger ones: how can he handle the story of the chase andrescue of Merry and Pippin, the storming of Isengard etc - stories which don't really add much to the core theme that is emerging.  Or is he now going to add the theme of the great contest of good versus evil to the unfolding reading?All of this points to the fact that the film, even though it is a feast of special effects, focuses on character.  And this also explains why Jackson chose the actors he did for their roles: they are not `big' names - no `Sean Connery', no `Alan Rickman', no `Brad Pitt', no `Sam Neill'etc.  He didn't want them getting in the way of the story of character.  Ian McKellan's talents, in particular, are used to tell a large proportion of the story: an enormous amount is conveyed simply through his facial expressions and even by the language of his body. The other miracle in all of this is Elijah Wood.  Like many others, when I first heard of Jackson's choice, I groaned: but Wood has been extraordinary.  He brings, as one friend said, a strange kind of androgyny to the role and this is just perfect. McKellan has already been knighted: give Wood the Oscar.And then there is Middle Earth: this is, as someone put it, another character in the story and the New Zealand landscape, digitally enhanced on occasion, lives up to its role too.Enough.  See this film!  Greatest film ever made?  How can one make a claim like that! Silly really; as silly as claiming that `The Lord of the Rings' is the greatest book ever written.  Can't one simply love a story, enjoy reading it a number of times amd lose oneself in it.  One CAN claim that it is the greatest work in its genre as is the film.10/10"

TheLastStop41,"Mar 27, 2002",10/10,"LOTR is without a doubt, the best movie I've ever seen. I don't care what the Academy says because without a doubt, it was the best film of 2001 (obviously... i said it was the best movie I've ever seen). It deserved the Academy Award 10 times more than A Beautiful Mind did. I mean look at the difference between ratings. LOTR: #3 ABM: #126 See a difference? LOTR will go on to be an unforgotten movie as what Star Wars is. In twenty years ABM won't even be on the top 250 list, while LOTR will still be in the top 50. SO LOTR fans just remember. Academy doesn't mean sh*t. Time says it all."
dgallegos,"Nov 25, 2002",10/10,"Star Wars has been dethroned.  Although George Lucas' movies are good in their own right (except for the juvenile elements he puts in to sell toys to finance the franchise), his scripts (which borrow heavily from J.R.R.Tolkien, mythology & religion) can't compare with the brilliance of the literary trilogy `The Lord of the Rings'.  Granted, Lucas took on a herculean task in writing & directing his story himself, but Tolkien's words, along with Peter Jackson's faithful adaptation & inspired vision, have created something no one man could equal.Of course, it helps that Jackson insisted on at least a 2 picture deal, & New Line Cinema was brave enough to foot the bill up front for 3 movies. They spent $180 million to film all 3 simultaneously.  With the New Zealand exchange rate, that equals $360 million ($90 million ea.), but since they used many of the same sets, and FX development costs were spread throughout, we're seeing $120-$150 million on the screen.  This will ensure consistency in plot, casting, tone, etc.In 3 hours, Jackson has crammed everything essential from the first novel & then some into the film, rewriting some scenes & dialogue with lesser characters for the leads, leaving out only what there wasn't enough time for.  Basically, you have two 90 min. movies running back to back.  There are no slow spots, just one climax after another.  From the opening 10 min. backstory where the Dark Lord Sauron is shown on the battlefield wiping out men & elves 10 at a time with each swing of his mace, I was blown away.  The romance between Aragorn, king in exile, and Arwen, daughter of the elf-lord, is played up for the ""Titanic"" quotient, but it's well done.The story, sets, costumes & FX are so rich, you'll have to see the film several times to absorb everything.  The unspoiled New Zealand locales are spectacular, providing a variety of environments to represent the different settings on the characters' journey.  The location sets are imaginative, detailed & weathered, adding to their believability, while the studio sets match them in meticulousness.  The costumes are at once familiar & strange, drawing on both the medievil & the fantastic, but more important, they're also functional & practical.  The music by Howard Shore is appropriately sweeping, Celtic & folky in keeping with the novel, although it lacks the memorable themes of John Williams or Jerry Goldsmith, but neither would commit a year or more to a 3 picture project.  The FX are as they should be, unobtrusive & unnoticed most of the time, there only to support the story not draw attention away from it as in most Hollywood movies which try to coverup illogical plots & bad acting.I'm particularly gratified by the casting of Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn which was a last minute stroke of luck when the actor first chosen for the part backed out due to differences with the director.  I've always thought Mortenson had an intensity & striking but not pretty-boy looks that could portray a flawed, dangerous hero instead of the villains Hollywood always picked him for.A stellar cast giving some of their best performances, visuals that deliver beyond what I imagined, a perfect mix of humor, passion & tragedy, and a feeling of grandeur, scope & impending doom.  Perhaps as an ensemble piece with so many characters & the inability to concentrate on any one, it can't be measured against some of the classic character study films, but even the casual moviegoer can grasp the ideas & not get lost  As far as I'm concerned, it's one of the greatest films of all time."

bzb2001,"Feb 10, 2005",7/10,"'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is an epic, ambitious film in scope and magnitude, if not in heart. It tells the fantastic story of Frodo, a hobbit (small person) from the Shire in Middle Earth. The Shire is a peaceful place, as close to utopia as one might find. His peace is interrupted when the sorcerer Gandalf rides into town and discovers the secret to Bilbo's ring. Bilbo, also a hobbit, acquired the ring from Gollum - a distorted creature whose life has been elongated, but also deformed, by the mystical ring.When Bilbo leaves for adventure, it is Frodo's job to return the ring to the desolate Mount Doom and cast it into the fire from which it was made. This, you see, is the only way to destroy the ring. As a mere hobbit, Frodo cannot shoulder this burden alone. Along for the journey is his gardener and confidant Samwise, Sam for short. Two other hobbits, Merry and Pippin, too immature for their own good, meet up with Frodo and Sam on their way to the magical land of elves.Once there, a ""fellowship"" is formed to destroy the ring. One of them is Aragorn, a ranger with a secretive past. He is the primary focus of 'Lord' other than Frodo and the ring. He is a descendant of the man who held the ring over Mount Doom and could not destroy it. He is in love with the elf Arwen but the backdrop of the times leaves that love affair in jeopardy.Sauron, the dark lord who originally created the ring, has found out its location and seeks out the hobbits, and later the fellowship, to take the ring back. Saruman, the secondary villain in the film, is Sauron's ""puppet,"" but also wants the ring for his own power. He is a sorcerer like Gandalf, but has turned to evil.Also in the fellowship, protecting the ring from Sauron and Saruman, is another man, Boromir. He is from the land of Gondor. Legolas is the lone elf representative in the fellowship. Elves are the fairest of the many creatures of Middle Earth and gifted archers. There is also a dwarf (slightly taller than a hobbit and certainly more robust) named Gimli. Dwarfs reside in mines, great connections of caves in the mountains through which the fellowship must journey in order to complete their task.It is difficult to summarize the plot of 'Lord of the Rings' because of the amount of information that is thrown at you. There are characters and their ancestors; different creatures in the elves, dwarfs, hobbits, and men. In addition to them there are the mysterious orcs, goblins, ringwraiths, uruks, sorcerers, and the creature all onto itself, Gollum. This complexity in setup and the numerous strands of plot to keep under control is the primary problem with 'The Lord of the Rings.' It took me up to three viewings to saturate all of this material and half way understand it.The triumph of Peter Jackson's labor of love is that you want to watch it indefinitely to soak in all of this splendor. The effects and settings are indescribable other than to say nothing this stunning has ever been featured on film before. Visually, the picture has no equal and will forever be understood as altering the way movies are seen. Unfortunately, to tell the story's backdrop, much of the humanity involved in Middle Earth is left on the back burner. In addition to that, there is a serious problem with pacing.The filmmakers seemed more interested in remaining faithful to J.R.R. Tolkien's original creation than they are in attempting to make a workable adaptation into a film. In that regard, there is a large battle sequence that feels very much like the climax of the film, but is then followed with upwards of an hour of more footage! This was the straw that led 'Fellowship' from being a great film into a good film. With that in mind, I am forced to think of 'Fellowship' as split. It is a masterpiece of visual technology and presentation, but married to a story that needs more heart and less intrusion of detail. *** out of ****"
clementine-kruczynski,"Oct 15, 2005",2/10,"This movie was over-hyped, and the only thing about it that I found fabulous were the special effects. However, this did not make up for the lack of emotional depth in the movie and the drawn out attempt at building suspense. Compared to the series of books this movie is based on, the movie seems shallow and lacks cohesiveness and character development. I was bored and just wanted the movie to finish, which is rare for me. Less focus on special effects and more attention to good acting and a story that builds suspense would have made for a better movie. Perhaps a little more background into the character's lives, for example, would have added a lot to the overall presentation."
Scarlet13,"Feb 17, 2002",N/A,"When I first saw the trailers for ""The Fellowship of the Ring,"" I had never had any interest in reading the lengthy tome of a trilogy.  But seeing the possibility of the movie, I immediately went out and read the whole thing, insisted on receiving it for Christmas, and enjoyed every minute of it. The feelings I had while reading the series were heightened seeing it come to life in the stunning movie.  I thought it was a fabulous work of art.I thought that having Galadriel tell what was basically the prologue of the book was a good idea, as it helped those who had never read the story.  It also immediately involved me in the film; I felt I had an insider's advantage on the rest of the audience.  Cate Blanchett has a wonderfully deep and emotional voice; the way she speaks Galadriel is almost as effective as her appearence as the Elven queen.  Also, showing the last battle of Isildur and Sauron helped unfog a part of the novel that had me a trifle confused.The entire movie is full of beautiful sets and landscapes.  The Shire was almost exactly as I'd pictured it.  Hobbiton is cute and very whimsical. Mordor was frighteningly well done, extremely real.  Rivendell had a little bit of a European-tourist-trap look, but was beautiful all the same.  The entire backdrop of the movie (the mountains, Moria, Isengard) was perfect; it's amazing that ""Fellowship"" was filmed in one country.Now to the characters.  All I can say is, ""Wow.""  I was a little apprehensive about the casting at first; I'd created such real images of the characters in my imagination, I almost didn't want them spoiled for me. However, I was not disapointed in the least.  Elijah Wood, though not one of my favorite actors, was believable.  You could tell from the first glimpse that Frodo was special; Wood's pale, sharp features contrast sharply with the more ruddy, robust look of the rest of the hobbits.  He also cries like a little girl.  But his weaknesses and strengths make his Frodo an apt choice for the starring character.  The rest of the Hobbiton gang was well-chosen, too.  Sean Astin (""Rudy"" forever to me) was loyal and a bit bumbling, just like the Gamgee of Tolkien's telling.  Pippin and Merry were congenial, slow-witted lads, but very brave nonetheless.  Viggo Mortensen is outstanding.  He has the ability to make Aragorn both menacing and kind. He physically represents Strider to the nines with his strength and virility; the action sequences of his are very passionate and exciting.  Some may have complained about Arwen's character being slightly expanded; I thought it a good change.  In the books, you have to read the whole trilogy and then rifle through the appendix in ""The Return of the King"" to learn the history between Aragorn and Arwen.  Liv Tyler is ethereal and breathtaking, but at the same time displays the courage and magic that make the Elves the beings they are.  Speaking of Elves, I can't help but gush over the handsome and ever-so-talented Orlando Bloom as noble Legolas.  Bloom captured the archer's very movements; he treads lightly and fights fearlessly. Legolas's bowmanship was amazing; he looked so natural loosing his arrows machine-gun style.  He was my favorite character in the books, and his essence transcends the film.  Gimli was pompous and brave, as well.  He is well-represented in the movie.  Boromir was hopelessly lost, but at the same time valiant and strong.  Sean Bean gave an emotionally-charged performance as the tortured warrior.  Hugo Weaving was very good as Elrond.  He was noble and cold at the same time.  And Gandalf.  What more can be said of Ian McKellan's showcase portrayal of the wizard?  He was magnificent.  He could be Gandalf, the kind old conjurer who set off pyrotechnics for hobbit-children.  Then he could turn around and stun the life out of you with Gandalf the powerful wizard, facing the balrog with defiance and an iron will.  His Oscar nomination is well-deserved.Peter Jackson is a brave soul to take on a project that could have backfired in so many places.  Instead of bringing us uninspired kitsch, he serves up raw emotion, graphic battles of good and evil, chilling and wonderful characters, and enough special effects (realistic, mind you) to make John Cameron's mouth water.  Knowing that ""The Two Towers"" was my favorite of the books, I eagerly anticipate the second helping of ""The Lord of the Rings."""
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 16, 2023",10/10,"A mild mannered hobbit named Frodo, back by eight companions has to face all manner of danger, battling many foes in order to save Middle Earth.I'm not sure I can say much that hasn't been said multiple times, it truly is one of the greatest movies ever made, foolishly I have only watched it once since its original release, and tonight I was as captivated, entertained and genuinely spellbound as I was when I first saw it.Action packed, dramatic, emotional and entertaining, this film has it all, there are no lulls, it entertains you from start to finish, an impressive feat for a film that runs over three hours long.The visuals are sensational, from the glorious landscapes, incredibly costumes and makeup, to the dazzling special effects, you truly are transported to a world of pure fantasy.The music is spot on too, who doesn't love to hear Enya.The acting is phenomenal, credit to all involved, Wood, Lee, McKellen, Blanchett, Mortensen and all concerned are terrific, being a huge Sean Bean fan I have to comment on his amazing performance.It's a fabulous movie.10/10."
dee.reid,"Aug 3, 2005",10/10,"...I wasn't sure anyone would have ever guessed (except in a 2004 Fangoria magazine article written by Mexican visionary Guillermo del Toro) that New Zealand native Peter Jackson, the director behind the ""goriest movie ever made"" (1992's ""Dead Alive""), would have been behind the epic three-film installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" saga, which include ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (2001), ""The Two Towers"" (2002), and Best Picture Oscar-winner ""The Return of the King"" (2003).***Note*** This comment applies to all three movies, as it will be posted at each individual web page.Not since ""Star Wars"" has this much hype surrounded films of this magnitude. But I guess such hype exists because J.R.R. Tolkien's books have one of the largest devoted fanbases of any popular reading material. I've never read Tolkien's original books, though several readers as well as fans of the movies have told me such knowledge is not required when viewing ""The Lord of the Rings"" films. ""The Lord of the Rings"" is the biggest movie I've ever seen, and there's a whole lot of story, 12+ hours to be exact, and I've spent the last two days viewing the extended versions of all three movies and they are breathtaking. There are many dazzling special effects shots over the course of the trilogy and epic battle sequences to put you in awe (many of which, in my view, do push the limits of the ""PG-13"" rating), not because it's action but because of how precise Jackson's direction is, and how unflinching the camera becomes when it's time for battle. The rousing, epic score by Howard Shore helps the viewer get ""into"" Jackson's vision of Middle-earth, and into the characters and on-screen action. Jackson has also breathtakingly transformed his New Zealand homeland into Tolkien's Middle-earth and when you watch these movies, you feel like you're really there, with the rest of its inhabitants. It is also pretty frightening too, with many jump scenes including the frequent and violent battle sequences between our heroes and ""The Enemy,"" who include the brutish Orcs, Moria Orcs, Ringwraiths, and the unreal entity Sauron. And lastly, the cast does much more than bring the action to life, but instead live (""live"" is italicized) their parts. Of course, I'm talking about the young Hobbits Frodo (Elijah Wood) and Sam (Sean Astin), who come into possession of the ancient One Ring and must journey to the hellish land Mordor to cast the talisman into a river of lava and bring its reign of evil to an end. Along the way, two other Hobbits Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd), necromancer Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), warrior Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), Boromir (Sean Bean), elf Legalos (Orlando Bloom), and dwarf Gimli (John Rhys-Davies) aid them in their quest - together as a ""fellowship of the ring."" There are also plenty of other fantastic supporting roles from Cate Blanchett, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee, Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving (Agent Smith plays a good guy), and Andy Serkis as the voice of the ever-creepy Gollum. I think J.R.R. Tolkien would be proud of Peter Jackson's take on his material, despite comments I've heard his son has made in undermining the director's vision. Someone once called ""The Lord of the Rings"" the greatest fantasy epic ever made; they were right.10/10"
jaesboxer,"Jun 26, 2002",10/10,"For the thousands of fans who thought it couldn't be done, to the skeptics and the critics who observed Peter Jackson's adaptation of the Lord Of The Rings into a trilogy would be the next Ishtar, a disaster of epic proportions, allay your fears.  The Lord Of The Rings:  The Fellowship Of The Ring is the most daring cinematic event to take place in years, and despite the fact it undeservedly lost the best picture oscar to A Beautiful Mind, it is, I strongly believe, a film for the ages.  NOt since Gone With THe Wind has an epic tale, critically acclaimed, been adapted into a film which is astounding in its own right.  The sets are marvelous, the characters portrayed to perfection (Most notably Ian McKellen as Gandalf), and the mythology of Middle-Earth brought to vivid life, combining to make a film that is both spectacular in its grandeur and engaging in its characters.  This is a film I believe equal to Lawrence Of Arabia in its scope, and I am anxiously awaiting the sequel THe Two Towers being released this Christmas."
Tyson14,"Dec 17, 2014",10/10,"Sixty years ago, the Hobbit Bilbo Baggins came into possession of a magic ring. When he decides to leave his home in the Shire and retire, he finds it curiously difficult to leave the ring behind. Disturbed, the wizard Gandalf investigates and discovers that Bilbo's trinket is actually the One Ring of legend, which the Dark Lord Sauron needs to complete his return to power. Bilbo's cousin Frodo has to take the Ring on a long and arduous journey across Middle-earth to the volcano known as Mount Doom, deep within Sauron's land of Mordor, the only place where it can be destroyed.Back in 1999, when Peter Jackson began filming The Lord of the Rings, there was an expectation of failure. A thousand-page-long book adapted into three three-hour movies by a director whose biggest previous movie had been a minor ghost comedy starring Michael J. Fox? And on a budget of only $90 million apiece at a time when $200 million+ budgets for such epic films were becoming more commonplace? It seemed like a recipe for disaster.Against the odds, Jackson pulled it off. The trilogy as a whole is a remarkable work, translating Tolkien's vision onto the screen with - for the most part - respect and integrity. There are missteps, mistakes and some ill-conceived changes, but these are mostly restricted to the second and third films in the sequence. The Fellowship of the Ring, on the other hand, is moved from page to screen with enviable skill.The main key to the film's success is the casting. Elijah Wood may be a lot younger than Frodo in the novel, but he sells Frodo's mix of book- learned wisdom with a lack of practical experience with wide-eyed enthusiasm. Representing the old guard, veteran actors Ian McKellen, Ian Holm and Christopher Lee bring their roles of Gandalf, Bilbo and Saruman to life with presence and gravitas. The actors are pretty much all excellent, even Cate Blanchett as she struggles with a curiously-written interpretation of Galadriel. Marton Csokas is probably the film's weakest acting link as Celeborn, but given he has about twenty seconds of screen time, this is not a major issue. I must also admit to not being altogether convinced by Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn the King, but as Strider the Ranger in this first film he is superb.In terms of scripting and changes from the books, some key sequences are missing. Tom Bombadil is gone (which is a wise move), as are the barrow- wights (which is more regrettable) and other elements are compressed (the journey from the Shire to Bree, which covers dozens of pages in the book, happens instantly on-screen) or eliminated altogether (Fatty Bolger, the 'Fifth Hobbit', is exorcised from events). Other events that happened in the book off-page or only in flashback occur here in their correct chronological order, such as Saruman's confrontation with Gandalf at Isengard.For the most past these changes are well-judged, even if some fan- favourite moments are left out. For a three-hour movie the pacing is generally excellent, with a good mix of exposition, character-building moments and action set pieces. The movie's effects are impressive, with CGI being held back and used only when absolutely necessary, with miniatures often employed to give physical locations a sense of presence and weight. Whilst clearly resulting from budgetary restrictions, this prevents the film getting buried under fake-looking CGI and means it still has more convincing effects than the recent first Hobbit movie, which feels a little silly.It's difficult to pick a stand-out moment from the film. The Black Riders pursuing the Hobbits is an evocative moment, as is the confrontation on Weathertop and the flooding at the Fords of Bruinen. The outstanding sequence is probably the descent through Moria, which features both excellent character moments (such as Gandalf's conversation with Frodo when they discover that Gollum is pursuing them), humour (Pippin's encounter with a skeleton on a well), action (the battle with the cave troll in the chamber of Mazarbul) and tragic horror (Gandalf's last stand on the bridge of Khazad-dumb). The whole sequence is a joy to watch.The film missteps a little near the end: the trip to Lorien, where the Fellowship regroups after Moria, made sense in the book but in the film it dangerously comes close to killing the pace of the movie altogether. This is not helped by the somewhat bizarre characterisation of Galadriel. Jackson is to be commended for trying to make the longueur work, but ultimately it feels like it's delaying the film's climax too much at the moment it should be ramping up towards it. Fortunately, in the cinematic edition it's a fairly brief sequence. Events culminate in the epic battle on Amon Hen, with Sean Bean delivering a stand-out performance during Boromir's last stand and Sean Astin's Sam getting his first notable moments in the film's cliffhanger ending.The movie's success is furthered by some truly remarkable production design and the quite astonishing soundtrack by Howard Shore, which must rank as one of the finest movie soundtracks of all time.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring remains, thirteen years on, one the finest fantasy movies ever made. The writing, acting and effects work all combine and work in tandem with one another to produce something very special, something that Peter Jackson has struggled to replicate ever since."
Cineleyenda,"Feb 17, 2002",10/10,"The storyline in the ""Lord of the Rings"" is well constructed and interesting, the film is well-paced (you never get bored tho it is long), and the action scenes are well done.  But most of all, it is a dazzling visual marvel.Whether outdoors--scenes of forests and trees, valleys, streams, mountains--or in caves and the like, the visuals are superb.  Color, design, intricacy, detail, contrasts.  The backdrops are excellent.  There are battles with monsters and things like that, but the special effects are not overdone or pompous--they work very well.  A key for me here was not too much sped up action to create excess and pomposity and to have a hard time following what is going on, like in sci fi space battles or the Mummy movies or flicks like that.  Indeed, not only the pace of the plot, but the action, has economy.  In the outdoors, the backdrops are very pretty but for the most part realistic, but in the caves things are done up, with somewhat exaggerated or surreal colors, designs, effects.However, there are other movies with good visuals, even tho it is difficult to think of ones that outdo this.  But what sticks out most, in my mind? Not specifically the things I mentioned in the previous paragraph, but the LIGHTING.  Yes, that overlaps with the other things--backdrop, colors, etc., but it is particularly this item and the obvious sophistication and care that went into it, and the resulting artistic brilliance and beauty, that make the visuals, the cinematography, so excellent in my mind.  Whether indoors or outdoors, the lighting effects, the beauty, blending, and contrasts, are the highlight of the film.10 out of 10."
mstomaso,"Nov 30, 2007",10/10,"Peter Jackson set out to make movies which the author of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, J.R.R. Tolkien would have endorsed. All three were resounding successes, though because of the film medium they necessarily varied from Tolkien's story-line. Purists may have issues with Jackson's theatrical license, but as someone who has read Tolkien's books several times and seen the films 4-5 times each, I never felt that Jackson went too far or compromised Tolkien's story, the mythology he developed or the wonderful characters he brought to life. Many have said what Jackson did could not be done. He has not only proved the nay-sayers wrong, but lovingly crafted a set of films which will, for many decades to come, stand out as a great achievement.This is the first of three reviews I am publishing on IMDb for these films. I am labeling them Parts 1, 2, and 3 just in case anybody wants to read them in order. The reviews will be self-contained, but will also be enhanced by a chronological reading. My reviews will focus on the extended edition DVDs, though my comments are also relevant to the theatrical releases.The Fellowship of the Ring introduces the key characters and the broad story arc of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Wizard Gandalf the Grey travels to a small town for small people (Hobbits)to help celebrate Bilbo Baggins' birthday. The very elderly Baggins doesn't look a day over 45, and soon it becomes apparent why. Since the great adventure of his life, a quest he was sent on by Gandalf himself, he has possessed the most powerful object in all of Middle Earth  The One Ring.This ring is evil incarnate, with an insatiable lust for power, it taints every creature who possesses it and tries to work its way back to its creator  Dark Lord Sauron. Bilbo uses the ring to disappear, as he intends to spend his senescence with his friends the Elves in Rivendell. But activating the ring, he draws the attention of Lord Sauron from thousands of miles away in the land of Mordor. Realizing what has occurred, Gandalf scrambles to determine a course of action and recruits Bilbo's nephew Frodo and his loyal gardener Samwise to bear the ring to the Council of Elrond in Rivendell. Thusly, the seeds of the fellowship are planted in the soil of the Shire.At this point, we are about 1/6th of the way through The Fellowship. Fairly soon thereafter, it becomes clear who will compose the fellowship, and who and what these people are. Though the succeeding films are not entitled ""Fellowship"", they follow the adventures of the surviving central characters. Characterization is done just as Tolkien did it in the original novel  by example not discourse.For example, we are given hints to the identity of Strider (Mortenson) earlier on in the movie than in the novel, but the actual significance of this remains ambiguous until about midway through. Strong characterization is key to the success of the entire trilogy. To summarize, Peter Jackson, his team and cast  NAIL the characterization.The casting and acting is perfect. It is very difficult to resist the temptation to single out Mortenson and McKellen for carrying their difficult roles so well (Strider/Aragorn and Gandalf), but why risk diminishing the contributions of the rest of the cast? Nobody mis-steps, and it is clear from the beginning that the entire cast was thoroughly and completed engaged with the task before them.Tolkien believed that no film would ever do his work justice, and until this trilogy, he was correct.Peter Jackson and his team have managed to do exactly what they set out to. As Jackson himself has said in reference to the film trilogy, they set out to 'make Tolkien's film.' Jackson successfully drew out elements of all three books, expanding and contracting, rearranging, and sometimes adding whole subplots which are hinted at in the books, but not well explained, in order to adopt the grand story to the film medium. Arwen (Liv Tyler), daughter of Elrond and Elven lover of Aragorn, for example, is introduced early in the films and plays a role in the films which is much more equal to her significance than it was in the books.The Howard Shore score is lovely, and its simple themes are used to great effect throughout all three movies. The musical collaborations improvising on Shore's basic themes are great, and, though they feature some prominent performers  are never weighed down by star-power.Jackson made all three movies simultaneously. This technique allowed for perfect continuity, and permitted much greater flexibility in editing and post-production work than would normally be allowed. Knowing that he would need to establish and support his own fellowship to make this production work, he also knew that success would make the production legendary. So, he documented the creation of the films beautifully. Two complete DVDs full of documentary pieces are included in all three Special Edition Packages in the trilogy. Many are likely to be bored by the details in these documentaries, but those interested in the creative process behind the films will be provided with a more comprehensive view than I can remember ever seeing in any similar DVD package.The Fellowship of the Rings is as true a representation of Tolkien's novel as can be imagined. Although some aspects of the stories in the novel were adapted to the screen, the essentials, the characters, and the overall story are not just recognizable, but ENHANCED by the film. What results is a film that is not just entertaining, but an enormous fulfillment of an undying wish of millions of fans around the world.Very highly recommended."
martimusross,"Mar 5, 2020",10/10,The Lord Of The Rings TrilogyPerhaps the best adaptation of a gargantuan novel ever made thus far.Words defy analysis but in short all the forces are martialled by Peter Jackson in service of the story that is enabled with a breadth and scope never before achieved before this.
Mr_PCM,"Feb 28, 2006",10/10,"There is very little that can be said about The Lord of the Rings that hasn't been said already many times over. But what can be re-iterated is that The Fellowship of the Ring is an outstanding piece of film-making.Where do you start when reviewing a film the size of Lord of the Rings? J.R.R. Tolkein's seminal masterwork, long considered unfilmable, has made it on to the screen thanks to visionary director Peter Jackson. The Fellowship of the Ring is the first of the three books of the trilogy. Everyone has their favourite of the three, and this one is probably mine. Unrivalled in its size and scale by virtually any other film, with new groundbreaking special and digital effects, a stunning musical score, universally superb acting and most importantly a superb story.The Fellowship of the Ring is the first part of the epic trilogy that tells of the quest of a hobbit to destroy an evil ring of power. He is aided in his quest by his friends and other companions who accompany him and protect him on his journey. Many threats face him on his long journey, both from the world around him and from his companions, who could be tempted by the power of the ring he has set out to destroy. It is a tale of magic and fantasy, swords and sorcery, but it is not simply for teens who enjoy dungeons and dragons games. It is accessible to everyone. By turns exciting, frightening, funny and sad, it is a true masterpiece in terms of storytelling, encompassing the full spectrum of emotions.The acting is superb from the entire cast, and it is unfathomable as to how the Academy overlooked the acting entirely for all three films when dishing out awards and nominations. However the performances from Ian McKellan, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood and Sean Bean are all so good it would have possibly been greatly unfair to single any one out for an award.The film also contains some groundbreaking computer-generated special effects, and some positively genius scale work. Due to hobbits being only about 3 feet tall, some clever scale work was needed in order to ensure that John Rhys-Davies, a dwarf in the film but over 6 feet tall in real life, did in fact look the height of a dwarf. This was done through clever use of forced perspectives, scale doubles, giant sets and blue screen filming. However, the most impressive use of computer effects lies later in the trilogy, with the appearance of Gollum  cinema's first live-action character who is completely computer generated. The music is also beautiful, and Howard Shore has created possibly the most iconic and memorable score since John Williams' Star Wars.Peter Jackson has, until Lord of the Rings, been seen as a director outside of the mainstream, but his superb, career-defining work on the Lord of the Rings trilogy has seen him well and truly propelled him to the forefront of Hollywood. He has re-defined the epic film with unparalleled success, and created films that will definitely stand the test of time, to one day be thought of with the same reverence as the Star Wars and Godfather trilogies.A major milestone in cinema history, the trilogy would eventually gain seventeen Oscars between the three films. Lord of the Rings is a master class in storytelling, and essential viewing."
alexo-15942,"Jun 2, 2022",6/10,"Lord of The Rings is, to me, the industry standard for fantasy films. That being said, it doesn't particularly resonate with me personally. Despite the strongly communicated themes of the virtues of bravery and fellowship, the downfall of this film (and book it's based off) is its worldbuilding. LOTR makes use of ""hard world building"", the narrator (or in this case the director) is very explicit in their worldbuilding, you directly see their vision through the inclusion of many details and direct explanations of events, characters, and places. LOTR uses this to great success, sadly it just doesn't resonate that well with me. I prefer the opposite, ""soft worldbuilding"", implicitly building the world leaving more up to interpretation. I don't mean to say that soft worldbuilding is objectively better, it's just my preference. This is why Lord of The Rings isn't really my type of movie, despite this I still think it's objectively good, the cinematics shine through here, the use of wide shots really encapsulates the scope of the world that this story takes place in, something I did really appreciate. The characters are also great, so all in all I do really think this movie set the bar for fantasy films in Hollywood. But again, it just doesn't really appeal to my preferences."
The_Core,"Jan 5, 2002",5/10,"I really don't understand the hype and attention surrounding this film.  It basically plays out like a video game version of the book.  Are people so bereft of imagination that they have to see it up on a screen in order to really enjoy it?As an avid reader, I occasionally run across a book that makes me think ""gosh, this would really make a great movie.""  In fact, after reading Stephen King's ""Rita Hayworth and Shawshank Redemption"" years before it was made into a film, I thought about that -- and the rest is history.Many have commented that LOTR is one of those stories that just don't translate well to the big screen, so what's the point?  And in my opinion, it honestly didn't translate well to the screen.  The story feels rushed, the action sequences feel like a video game and unless someone has read the books, it's impossible to care about the fates of any of the characters.  No matter what people say, this film is primarily by fans, for fans -- and that isn't a formula that translates into any kind of quality.What has happened to people?  How could this passable yet ultimately mediocre screen translation have made it to #1 on the IMDB?  I suspect it's because people are really wanting a continuation of the saga of Middle Earth, which I understand... being a big fan of LeGuin's ""Earthsea"" trilogy, I wanted more books featuring Ged's adventures among the islands too (the fourth book was almost a ""sellout"").  But I wouldn't want to see the Earthsea trilogy butchered like ""FOTR"" through translation to a format that's totally unsuitable.  LOTR might have made a great, high-budget miniseries, but condensing each book into ~3 hours is just flat-out impossible, it's butchery.  Murder by camera lens.I'm sure the video game (coming soon, no doubt) will sell millions of copies, because apparently that's what people want... an escape into imagination and fantasy, and for some reason this particular story is ""it"" to many people.  There's nothing wrong with that, but why aren't the books good enough?  You have to have Tolkien's subtlety browbeaten into you with ""The Mummy"" style CGI and sound effects, too?10/10 for the book series, 5/10 for the movie (great visuals, poor everything else)."
filipemanuelneto,"Mar 28, 2016",10/10,"Based on the novel by J.R.R. Tolkien and directed by Peter Jackson, this is the first film in the trilogy ""The Lord of the Rings,"" one of the most striking and most profitable in recent cinema. The film is set in an imaginary world, Middle Earth, where humans coexist with fantastic creatures such as elves, dwarfs, orcs's hobbit's etc. In this film, the balance of this illusory world is at stake because of the war against the evil lord Sauron, who eagerly wants to dominate, corrupt and submit all forms of life. In the midst of these events, two hobbit's living in the Shire, a little-known part of Middle Earth, have the difficult task of hiding the weapon that can decide the course of the war: a ring that gives power to Sauron and he desperately seeks to recover.Everything in this film, a contemporary epic, is perfect: the stunning scenery in New Zealand are breathtaking, the costumes were meticulously designed, the characterization is the top current range in film and computerized animations have been widely used to obtain scenes truly spectacular. The cast, in turn, is luxurious: in this film we have Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd (respectively, in the roles of the four hobbit's Frodo, Sam, Merrin and Pippin), Christopher Lee (as Saruman the magician), Sir Ian McKellen (as the Galdalf wizard the Grey), Cate Blanchett (as Lady Galadriel), Viggo Mortensen (as the walker Aragorn), Orlando Bloom (as the elven archer Legolas) and John Rhys-Davies ( as the dwarf warrior Gimli) and other very talented actors who gave the best of themselves to honor the audience with a movie luxuriously well done.It's not by chance that this movie, as well as the rest of the trilogy, had the impact it had. This is one of the most popular and profitable films of the century, maybe one of the best movies ever, marking the opening of the public to a new generation of epic films. There is only one mandatory film for any movie buff but one of the movies that few people could not see."

Every film is absolutely perfect and it all started with The Fellowship of the Ring.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring follows a Hobbit and eight companions who go on an adventure to destroy the powerful One Ring and ultimately defeat Sauron.The Fellowship of the Ring sets the LOTR trilogy to a terrific start. This is one of the films I wish I saw in theatres as the large scale of it make it a cinematic experience. Peter Jackson directs this film with all his might. Absolutely stunning camerawork enhance J.R.R. Tolkien's magnificent creation of Middle-earth and fully immerses the audience into that world. Seeing the Fellowship as they come over the mountain with Howard Shore's epic score playing over it just made me leap with joy. This film is three hours long but it never feels like that. The grand size of this world along with its characters and story keeps you engaged till the end. That shows how good the editing and pacing is. There is not one single boring moment.If that wasn't enough, the performances are sure to win you over. Elijah Wood is perfect as Frodo. What is left to say about Ian McKellan as Gandalf. He's simply iconic. Viggo Mortenson is legendary, Sean Astin and Sean Bean are fantastic. The entire ensemble cast is simply outstanding.The Fellowship of the Ring concludes the first chapter of the trilogy in a very satisfying way. The characters, the visuals, Howard Shore's epic score, the performances and Peter Jackson's tremendous direction make this a cinematic masterpiece."
singedelopera,"Jul 6, 2002",10/10,"The more and more one thinks of it, the more one reads Tolkien and appreciates it, the more and more brilliant this movie becomes.  Unlike Harry Potter, whose scenes were completely stripped from the book and had no imagination of its own (not to mention details that were changed for no good reason), this work not only has a soul of its own, but manages to keep with Tolkien's original work...  I love this film! Tis Brilliance!A word on Casting: perfect. My only qualm is that Galadriel (Cate Blanchett) was a little iffy.  Tolkien makes it a very clear that there is no evil in Galadriel or Lothlorien, but the audience never really gets this as we are all wondering if her skin is going to shed violently to reveal a hideous monster in the service of Sauron.  Nothing to depreciate the value that is this film though.  The emotional range is perfect, the quirkiness of the hobbits is perfect, the cast of characters is perfect... I LOVE YOU PETER! Now it is up to them not to ruin the next two.  As Peter has done so well with the first one, however, I don't see how he or his writing team could. 10/10"
Bob_Tanaka,"Jul 8, 2002",10/10,"I wish I could quote the whole poem. The Lord of the Rings is, far and away, the BEST MOVIE OF 2001!!! And #2 of all time!!! Right behind the Star Wars trilogy (which I count as one movie) and right above the Longest Day. The movie does it's best to follow the books (and cuts out several pointless parts) and is just as I pictured it. AMZING acting, UNBELEAVIBLE fx, AND ALL AROUND ONE OF THE MOST SPECTACULAR MOVIE OF ALL TIME!!! 10/10!!! and I only resurve that for the BEST  the most FLAWLESS of movies!!! Nominated for 13 academy awards and should've won all of them!!! but the academy ALWAYS  goes for the artsy movies!!!!"
RatBoy1323,"Aug 7, 2003",10/10,"This film is a triumph in almost every aspect.  I had never read the books upon seeing the film and was a little sceptical about what many people were claiming that it would change the way films were made.  Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring has become my favorite movie of all time.  And I have seen a lot of freaking movies.Every aspect of the film works.  The cast works their respective roles to perfection with Ian McKellen(Gandalf), Elijah Wood(Frodo), Viggo Mortensen(Aragorn), Sean Bean(Boromir), and Sean Astin(Sam) being the standouts.  From the epic prologue of the film you realize that there is a great, epic journey ahead of you.  And along the way you meet and care for every single character in the film.Director Peter Jackson has really crafted a beautiful piece of work that will be remembered for ages.  It's a perfect balance of action and great character moments.  Character development is not sacrificed for more action like so many other films of its like.  There are many moments of the film that make you realize this is more than just your typical fantasy film, moments that transcend filmmaking and have a profound effect on you. The last 30 minutes are particularly powerful and moving.Basically, this film is an epic, incredible experience.  A film that will be looked at years down the road as a great piece of filmmaking.  If you're a fan of good fantasy, or if you're just a fan of great movies, you'll love this film, plain and simple."
Hitchcoc,"Mar 2, 2006",10/10,"I am not fanatic, though I have read the books a couple of times. My interest in J. R. R. Tolkien goes to his knowledge of the history of language as well as his work in fantasy. I've seen some of the bad animation that was done using his work. I always assumed that this would be the only vehicle that could be used to bring these works to the screen. Now with a new generation of special effects masters, we have a work of art like the world has never seen. Granted, there can never be a definitive work that matches the depth and poetry of the books, but this captures the charm, the wonder, the amazing epic. To see the Shire presented in the first scenes and the party in the home of Bilbo as the creatures of this amazing fantasy are exposed is one of those incredible moments. The story is set up for the ultimate adventure as Frodo paddles out onto that lake, not knowing what has been set in motion. I will leave the real reviews to others. My first thought upon seeing this was, I just hope I survive to see it to its conclusion."
Theo Robertson,"Aug 16, 2002",10/10,"I've never been a fan of the sword and sorcery genre . I'm surprised film companies decide to make rubbish like THE BEASTMASTER, HAWK THE SLAYER and RED SONJA but I am aware of the popularity of JRR Tolkien's massive novel LORD OF THE RINGS and of it's popularity , I remember in a survey carried out by a very well known British fantasy/SF magazine in 1987 Tolkien's book was voted the greatest fantasy novel of all time ( THE STAND by Stephen King was a long way second ) , but it's a novel that has always struck me as being read by anoraks who - like fans of STAR TREK and STAR WARS - insist on reading subtexts that are just not there . When the THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS shot to number one in the IMDb top 250 films I put the popularity down to obsessed anorakish fans who were going to vote the film a classic no matter what . Stranger still I found groups as diverse as neo Nazis to gays to enviromentalists proclaiming "" This is our film "" so when I finally sat down to watch TFOTR I was expecting only some average entertainment for a non sad person with no political axe to grind . After seeing the film I had to admit THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is a masterpiece .Much of the credit must go to the producers . I 've no idea of the politics about bringing the story to the silver screen but I can imagine the Hollywood bigwigs sitting around the commitee table saying "" Give us Tom , give us Nicole , get Harrison , get Leonardo . No limeys . Limeys are slimy . No limey accents . We're Americans , this is our baby "" to which the producers gave a firm and resounding "" No "" . Good for them because the Hollywood treatment would have ruined this film. The cast comprised of well known - but not megastar - actors and unknowns are uniformally excellent even the normally hammy Lee and Rhys Davis and the bland Tyler are good . Also great to see so many Brits playing good guys and having the American actors adopting non specific British accents .The cast do a good jobThe other production values are outstanding . Pride of place goes to Andrew Lesnie's cinematography where the camera sweeps down from the sky into the Orcs underground lair and the camera also shows off the stunning New Zealand landscapes . I'd always believed Scotland had the greatest scenery on Earth but I'm willing to change my mind . The FX are good throughout though perhaps the matte backgrounds and CGI are less impressive in places but they're still a lot better than we've been used to recently . The Orc make up is wonderful and helps them become classic cinema monsters . The only bad point about the Orcs is - Like the stormtroopers in STAR WARS - they're too easy to kill .There are some minor flaws to THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RINGS but this is probably down to Tolkien's source novel rather than the film makers . A couple of times the heroes seem set to suffer a resounding defeat when something not obvious at first like flammable villains or a giant eagle saves the day . I guess this is cancelled out by the dangers and adversaries also appearing from nowhere and there's little female perspective in the story for the women in the audience to relate to but come on girls you've got Viggo Mortensen and Sean Bean acting all hunky and macho so you can't complain.I see the IMDb reviewers have started a backlash against FOTR like they did with TITANIC and GLADIATOR . They're right about the gawd awful rubbish that is TITANIC but they're wrong about GLADIATOR which is a very good film and even further wrong about THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING which is a cinematic masterpiece. Ignore their criticisms . Any film that is praised by people as diverse as fans of the book , people who have never read the book , enviromentalists and cynics like myself is worth your time watching . I'm really looking forward to THE TWO TOWERS"
Alexander Christie-Miller,"Jun 25, 2002",N/A,"'The Lord of the Rings' is one of my favorite books, I have read it several times, and remember thinking the last time, about 3 years ago that if I made a film I'd want to make it of this, but wouldn't it be almost impossible. You can then imagine how strong my expectations were when I went to see the eagerly awaited first installment.This film impressed me hugely, more than anything else because of how true it was to my imagination, both in the characters as well as in the effects and setting- a sentiment I have heard consistently from other fans of the books. Elijah Wood brought across the character of Frodo with the kind of haunted, frail courage that Tolkien captures so well in the books. Nor could I find any fault at all with Ian McKellan's Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen's Aragorn, and Sean Bean's Boromir, all of whom I thought were portrayed excellently. I could pick out instances where I did think, 'no, that's not right', however their seldomness in number would only serve to illustrate the excellence of the overall portrayal. One thing that did stand out for me was Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel, the part itself became so perfunctory in the film that to me her alternation between benevolent seer, and figure of potential terror seemed little more than a slightly confusing detour with no real connection into the plot other than as a vehicle for a glimpse into the future. But that was it.I thought that the points where Jackson did deviate from the text were completely the correct ones to do so. Shortening the opening Shire scenes and cutting out the whole Tom Bombadil bit was great since frankly they bored me slightly in the book anyway. Also, expanding the role of Arwen was a sensible decision.However this film is by no means above criticism. The dialogue was in my opinion terrible and purely there to drive on the plot. Normally this would ruin a film for me (as in ""The Matrix""), making it almost intolerable to view, however fortunately here it proves little more than a minor irritation. Also, the film seemed overall to be excessively plot-driven and at times a mad dash from one action scene to another, the characters, for all their truth to the book did seem flat and sometimes little more than stereotypical fantasy characters. This is perhaps my major quarrel with the film- I would have liked these characters to have come alive as people in a way that was made impossible by the sparseness of the script and the rollercoaster nature of the plot. In general the whole film lacked the depth of context that I think distinguishes Tolkien from other fantasy writers. However to have achieved this would have required a very different movie, and you can't fault an action film for being an action film.This movie is undoubtedly not for everyone. A lot of people just don't get fantasy- other than Lord of the Rings, I don't particularly either. However in my opinion Jackson really has made an incredible achievement- his and Tolkien's vision carried through suberbly by a breathtaking setting and stunning special effects, as well as by a cast clearly as enthralled as he was. He has taken on a huge task, and is dealing with it with breathtaking success."
poseyfan,"Jul 2, 2022",10/10,"I finish my rewatch, and then i think of something about this movie and i have to rewatch the whole trilogy again. I swear, I could rewatch the extended editions over and over again. This is the perfect start to an amazing trilogy."
Aaron1375,"Jan 7, 2002",10/10,"I didn't know quite what to expect when I went into the theater, all I knew is that I wanted to see a fantasy film with sword fights, magic and monsters.  I was not disappointed.  It exceeded my expectations because it had all the stuff I mentioned and great acting, and good character development as well.  I was enjoying the movie so much that I was very disappointed when it ended.  I would have gladly stayed another six hours if the showed the next two installments of this flick.  That was the only bad part of the film is the abrupt ending, but I still give this movie a 10, because it is a trilogy and I was expecting it.  If you want to see a great movie, one that delivers where so many have promised, but failed to deliever then this is the film to see...even if you didn't read the book.  And for anyone who has read the book I would love to hear your take on the movie, just don't give anything away about the next two parts."
Karma_K2,"Apr 2, 2002",10/10,"WOW!! First off, those who complain about the film...ARE YOU NUTS?!?! Films are merely forms of entertainment remember? And this film was very entertaining. The special effects were EXCELLENT!! I have to admit; I fell in love with a couple of actors after watching this movie. Hugo Weaving - always a favourite - made a delicious elf, as did Orlando Bloom. YUMMY!! Ian McKellen was lovely as Gandalf the Grey - GOOD MOVE! And Christopher Lee was really creepy as Saruman the White, but then again, isn't he always?Now to those who say that this movie has no plot, are you people blind? The plot is right there!! I'll spell it out for you. *Old hobbit (Bilbo) has evil ring, bequeaths it to young hobbit nephew (Frodo) *Frodo and 3 hobbit friends (Merry, Pippin and Samwise) directed by wizard Gandalf to embark on a journey to Rivendale (home of yummy elves) to give ring to elves for safekeeping. Unfortunately, no go. *4 hobbits continue journey with other members of fellowship of ring (Gandalf, Aragorn, Legolas, Gimli and Sauron) *Encounter danger *One dies *Journey to be continued in next movie Very basic, and I've probably left out a lot, but there you go.I really enjoyed this movie like you wouldn't believe - how DID ""A Beautiful Mind"" beat it? (Mind you, Russell Crowe is a pretty solid actor.) As a fantasy movie it rivals ""Harry Potter"", I loved it that much. (And I LOVED ""Harry Potter"" - especially Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape) All I have left to say is: 2 thumbs up; 10/10; ***** out of *****."
jwvandegronden-1,"Feb 7, 2022",9/10,"I watched the extended version of a meager 3.5 hours. Having seen snippets of the movie when it came out on DVD and friends were watching it, I couldn't be bothered. I had read so many fantasy books over the years, and generally I tended to be disappointed by any novel that was made into a movie, for instance most of the adapted masterpieces written by Stephen King are mediocre at best; Only later I was able to enjoy adaptations, first one that comes to mind is Birdy with Nicholas Cage.Back to Fantasy, I had given Tolkien a try when I was too young, collapsing under its' volume. Later I reread it and loved it, so given the effort I put into it, I didnt wat it to be tainted by a sub par undertaking. And yes the raving reviews were pretty much in my face, but when time goes on, well, you know... That.So now, in 2022 I took the time to watch it, be it in parts as I don't have 3.5 hours to spare anymore unfortunately, and it was overwhelmingly beautiful! It is so long and there is so much to tell, that it borders on tedious at times, but the investment is so big you have to finish, you can't let it go! And the payoff is massive, and I have to say the most human among the fellowship, the human played by Sean Bean, brought tears to my eyes. I even had to gasp for air, what a performance! Amazingly well done.Over 20 years later, and the movie is still rock solid, nothing waned, not the visual effects, not the vision of all the different worlds, nothing looks out of whack, but spot on and suspending disbelief is not a thing at all, throughout the entire length of the movie. You are there, with them.I have to tip my hat to Peter Jackson, and curse him at the same time. If the other two parts are as well done, I'm afraid I will have a massive sleep deprivation issue once done."

preppy-3,"Jan 3, 2002",10/10,"Incredible adaptation of the first book of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy.  I'm not going to summarize the story--there's way to much going on.  All I'll say is they took a verry difficult book with a intricate plot and made it an exciting, totally accesible movie.  The film moves quickly (with a few slow spots--but that's to get in the plot) and there's a lot to take in, but I was never confused.  I should mention that I tried twice to read the books but found them too hard.The film looks magical--Middle Earth looks beautifully real.  All the special effects are great (the Ring Wraiths are downright terrifying--as they should be) and the action sequences are among the best I've ever seen--fast, long and breathtaking.  The film is long (2 hrs, 40 min) but the time flies by.  The only problem is that there's so much plot and action going on that you're exhausted by the end--but in a good way.With the exception of Viggo Mortensen (very wooden) all the actors are good--top honors go to Elijah Wood, Dominic Monaghan, Cate Blanchett, Liv Tyler and (especially) Ian McKellan.But the film is VERY violent (despite the PG-13 rating).  It deserves an R--this is NOT one for the kids.  Still, it's the best film of 2001.  SEE IT!!!!"
happiscotsman,"Jul 16, 2002",10/10,"Roger Ebert only gave this film three stars because he felt it did not meet his personal criteria for what the movie should be like. But that is what Peter Jackson has been embellishing ever since he started on this nearly eight-year odyssey. It is Jackson's view of how HE would want the movie to be made. On that note, this film has been worth the three years I have spent salivating over any and every web site designed to proclaim the greatest film series ever (""Star Wars"" has lost its edge, and ""The Matrix"" has too narrow an appeal). The only reason I found out these movies were being made was because I was curious what Sean Bean had been up to. This was in 1998, and the wait was well worth it. New Zealand was the PERFECT place for filming Middle Earth, and Jackson does a fine job in making sense of the epic novel. The actors were all fine in their roles, although I still long for Sean Connery as Gandalf, even though Sir Ian McKellen did get an Academy Award nomination. Personally, I though the best performances were by Sean Astin and Sean Bean (Have I already shown my bias for the only man who could play Richard Sharpe?) And while the action scenes are quite engaging, the Rivendell scene stands out as my favorite. The first shots capture the mystery and splendor of Middle Earth's most enchanting and enigmatic characters, the Eldar (Elves to you non-readers of the novels). Howard Shore's Oscar-winning score is no better the here, with the ghostly chorus holding their notes as the Hobbits stroll mesmerized through this strange and beautiful land. The imagery is so engaging that the audience cannot help but be swept away as well. This is what movie-making is all about folks, and if you miss this, you've missed a lot."
HersheyAddict314,"Jun 20, 2002",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings. The first time I saw those letters appear on a trailer while watching Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon (in May), I thought it was the most ridiculous title for a movie. The trailer was disgusting-I thought the strange-haired little 'people' (later known as hobbits) were ugly and esoteric. Vaguely, I remember whispering to my best friend at the time, 'Ew...who's going to see THAT? What kind of freak would see a movie with such UGLY people??' Little did I know, I would become obsessed with this 'lurid' movie.About 7 months later, the tickets to 'A Beautiful Mind' were sold out, so I opted to go for LOTR, because nothing else seemed worth my $5.50. The movie astonished me right from the first scene, with the thousands of realistic warriors and beautiful scenery, I was immediately hooked. Throughout the movie, I don't think I blinked once. The characters, the Elvish language, the setting, everything intruiged me. It was artistically and originally beautiful, not at all what I expected. I didn't even notice 3 hours passing by before it ended and I sat dumbstruck in the theater for a while, listening to Enya vocalize 'May It Be.' I walked out of the theater like I walked into a new world.6 more times I saw the Lord of the Rings. I have two copies of the soundtrack (which is also fabulous) and am counting the days until the Two Towers. For anybody who has not seen this incredible movie, I suggest that you run to the nearest Blockbusters and rent it on August 6th, when it'll be released on DVD and VHS. It's almost essential to life. The actors-Elijah Wood, Ian McKellan and Viggo Mortensen-beautifully and acurately protrayed the characters of J.R.R. Tolkien's historic masterpiece, and Peter Jackson stayed true to the novel. I've read the books and became deeply interested in things I never have before, and have looked at things just a bit differently in this world.I highly recommend the Lord of the Rings, the Fellowship of the Rings, to anybody at any age anytime. It is my favorite movie, and I'm not surprised that over 60,000 others voted this movie as worthy of #3 on the spot of the top 250 movies of all time."
clowns_n_cookies,"Dec 18, 2003",N/A,"Once every so often in the long history of film, a movie will be made that breaks all boundaries of excellence. In no small way, it captures the eyes, hearts, and imaginations of millions of people around the world, and becomes one of the greatest cinematic masterpieces of it's time.Such movies can never be replicated. There is no way you could remake 'Gone With the Wind' and hope to measure it with it's predecessor. There is no way you can retell the first, great 'Star Wars' trilogy and hope to capture the same magic and amazement created all those years ago. (Despite George Lucas's constant efforts to try and make them better... *coughs*)And in the end, there is certainly no way that anyone, in any period of time henceforth, could take J.R.R. Tolkein's classic 'Lord of the Rings' novels and create movies that would dare to rival Peter Jackson's complete cinematic masterpiece.This, my friends, IS the great cinematic masterpiece of our time. There is no replicating. There is no retelling. To call the film perfect is by no means true, but you would definitely have to *reach* perfection if you even dared to capture the brilliance that Jackson has created in his epic trilogy.The landscapes and sets are, to put it shortly, absolutely breath-taking... especially when added to the emotionally stirring score by Howard Shore. The cast is superlative, with each actor completely embodying the characters so perfectly, you'd swear they were born to play them.'The Fellowship of the Ring', when all is said and done, is arguably the greatest telling of a classic story in movie history. It stirs, it inspires, it saddens, and it overjoys. But most of all, it lingers with you... far longer than you believed it capable of doing.And that, in the end, is what makes it the epic it aspires to be.A masterpiece of its time."
DaKingTM,"Jun 29, 2002",6/10,"I just saw this movie rank third in the top 250 movies of all-time, and steam came out of my ears. Who are these people that rate the worst movie released this year so highly? I will tell you who they are. They are people who have read the book a quadrillion times, and love it so much that they are unable to see this movie for the horror that it is. The book may be great, I wouldn't know because I haven't read it, but as a movie it sure bites! Yes, it's beautifully made. Yes, it does the book justice in the representation of it's characters. Bla bla bla. But you cannot fill three (3!!!) hours of a movie with a story that could be told in just one! The horrendously slow pace and ever lingering storytelling made me want to pull my hair out after the first hour! And to imagine they are going to make two more of these monsters... The mind boggles how ones vision can become so clouded by memories that this film actually becomes good. Same sort of story with the Matrix, but I've told that to a lot of deaf ears already, so I'll stop now.Sweat dreams..."
swlamboy,"Feb 2, 2005",5/10,"Trying to be as objective as possible from the stand-point of one of the ""purist"", my humble question is: Did Mr. Jackson ever read the books? Or more importantly, did Ms. Walsh ever read the books? After all, is it not the responsibility of the true screen writer to condense and translate (while remaining true to the original works) the written word to a format suitable for filming? While no one can deny that the cinematography, graphics, special effects and even the casting (in most cases) deserves the highest praise. It is the loss of the true spirit of the literary work, that irks me most.While I can forgive the omission of many key characters (the films would have been ten times longer), I can not forgive the changes made to what motivated the remaining characters; the blatant changes in events and the placement of characters; the addition of scenes and events that never happened in the book; and of who did what, when and especially why! For the ""purists"" I would not recommend these films, your will be utterly disappointed and dismayed. For those who don't care, or have never read the books -go -you'll have fun -enjoy!"

Geeky Randy,"Nov 29, 2014",10/10,"An absolutely gorgeous adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's first LORD OF THE RINGS installment detailing how well-meaning young hobbit Wood unwittingly inherits a ring from his adventurous uncle Holm which possesses a dark force that is powerful enough to end all life in Middle-Earth. Visually wondrous even for those who aren't that into the fantasy genre. This installment is particularly charming for less action and more character development and, for some reason, the Middle-Earth lingo works really well in this movie over the second and third films. Although FELLOWSHIP merely teases the viewer with the appearance of Gollum—while TWO TOWERS and RETURN are basically owned by Serkis as Tolkien's timelessly wretched creature who's not quite friend or foe—the movie is just too lovable to really even need his inclusion. McKellen is perfect as Gandalf the Grey, and Bean's performance brings to the foreground the genius of all these characters who suffers from similar temptations and weaknesses that we do in reality. It is FELLOWSHIP that holds the clearest mirror up to us, while the following two films kind of just linger in the wartime aftermath. The greatest fantasy film of all-time.**** (out of four)"

These action sequences are immaculate, and it is a gorgeously directed movie, the cinematography was so good I couldn't get enough.It's also very, very funny, who knew Sean Astin, who I love, would grow up to be a hobbit, every actor in this gives a really great performance, and these special effects are top-tier, they're unbelievable.The Fellowship of the Ring also has one of the greatest climaxes I've ever seen, not only that, it has incredible creatures that actually scared me.Yes, it is very, very long with a runtime of nearly 3 hours, but it never drags despite that.Peter Jackson had a vision here, and it was an amazing vision, along with a story that was epic.And I'm gonna give Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring an A+"

There are a few sections of the book that were left out of the film and there is information in this first movie that isn't revealed until later in the trilogy of novels.  However, the movie is so well done, all is forgiven. Gorgeous cinematography, spot-on casting, lush score, and the right mix of sentiment, suspense, and comic relief.  I haven't enjoyed a movie so much in quite a while.  Brilliantly done!"
zkonedog,"Mar 10, 2017",10/10,"Adapting a novel for the big screen is never easy, as the printed-word format is often quite expansive and not easily pared down to suit the necessities of the big screen. Now, try that transition with perhaps the most well-known fantasy novel of all-time. That was the task director Peter Jackson faced while creating ""The Fellowship of the Ring"". Not only does he succeed, but he does so on perhaps the highest possible level. ""Fellowship"" is truly one of the greatest book-to-film transitions ever attempted.For a very basic overview, this films establishes the legacy of the One Ring of Power and the fellowship put together to protect/destroy it. The ring, initially possessed by Hobbit Bilbo Baggins (Ian Holm), is passed down to nephew Frodo (Elijah Wood) who begins his trek to destroy it by casting it into the fires of Mount Doom from whence it was created. Joining Frodo on his journey are...-Gandalf the Grey Wizard (Ian McKellen)
-Legolas the Elf (Orlando Bloom)
-Gimli the Dwarf (John Rhys-Davies)
-Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) & Bolomir (Sean Bean) of the Realm of Men
-Fellow Hobbits Sam (Sean Astin), Merry (Dominic Monaghan), & Pippin (Billy Boyd)The scale of this endeavor--even just this first installment--is perhaps unmatched in the entirety of cinema. Unlike some high-aiming adaptations that might pull punches or cut corners, this is an ""all-in"" effort from the get-go. From costuming to music, location, acting, and special effects, you'll hardly feel like you're watching a movie. Instead, you will essentially be living within it. That is how expertly Jackson captures the realms of Middle Earth.Obviously, J.R.R. Tolkien (original writer of the novel trilogy) crafted a story in LOTR that will be passed down through the generations. But Jackson accomplishes just as monumental a feat. While cutting and trimming here and there to make the long tomes work in a cinematic setting, there is very little lost in the change-over. The books I was utterly captivated by as an adolescent are--rather improbably--equaled here.As such, I consider ""Fellowship"" an extraordinary film to kick off the LOTR trilogy on the big screen. In hindsight, if the trilogy can be evaluated as standalone efforts, it is probably the best of the bunch. As the closing credits roll and the promise of further adventure beckons, you are almost guaranteed to feel two things: an intense desire to dive into ""The Two Towers"", and the overwhelming knowledge that an incredible book has been miraculously transformed into a never-to-be-outdone film."
worldblee,"Dec 22, 2001",6/10,"Tracking all the making of information leading up to the film, it seemed like Jackson was doing a great job. The scenery, props, casting, makeup, and effects all seemed beautifully authentic. And in action, they deliver. But the script (it's always a danger when you see three writers and one of them is the director) spoils the magic.It's more than making Arwen's role more significant (and a completely different character) in a blatant attempt to beef up the roles for women. I didn't like that, but women's roles are admittedly sadly lacking in the original story. It's that Jackson puts his clumsy fingerprints all over Tolkien's themes and tells the story from the perspective of Men. Apparently, modern moviegoers need to identify with their race. (Side note: all the critics who say how the movie has preserved the magic of the books probably haven't read them since college.)The relationship between the four hobbits isn't set up at all in the movie; aside from Frodo the other three hobbits seem thrown into the quest by chance. Rather than being a reluctant, conflicted hero, Frodo is praised by all the other characters but actually does little but squeal, get stabbed, and look on the elves in wonder. Saruman (a lesser character in the fiction who only appears the first book through Gandalf's recollection) takes up far too much time in the movie. And by the end we've seen Sauron's eye so much I wonder there's anything to reveal of the dark lord in the second and third movies. I expected changes, but I fail to see the rationale for many of Jackson's edits--they don't make the story better or the action flow more smoothly.The Lord of the Rings is an elegiac tale of the passing of magic from the world and of the heroic struggles of those races passing from the world to preserve goodness. In Jackson's eyes, history is told from the perspective of the victors, the Men. Hobbits, who drive the action in the books, are along for the ride while Aragorn, Boromir, et al are the real protagonists in the movie.I give Jackson full credit for taking on a task of this scale and achieving an epic feel. If only he'd started with a script as good as his scenery."
Goataid,"Jul 10, 2002",1/10,"The problem with this film is not it's look, as it does look amazing, but it's length and  confusing nature.  Now if you've read the book then I dare say you'd have an idea what's going on but if you haven't then what I am told is an 'awesome epic' becomes a rather long film involving walking. And boy do they walk. they walk up hills, through forests, caves and over mountains. And then then walk some more!Another fault with the film is that although the cast has been assembled to be true to the book, none of them have any presence at all. It all makes you wish that someone with some charisma would turn up in a car and get on with it"

Atticus_1588,"Jul 29, 2002",10/10,"I have seen ""LOTR: The Fellowship of the Ring"" twice in theatres. The first time I left I knew I had seen something great...but I needed to see it again. I went back about two weeks later and realized this film is brilliant. The story is extremely strong. A simple story told complex, and greatly. Although I have not read the books I plan on eventually doing so now that I have seen the film. The acting is also a very, very strong part of this film. Elijah Wood deserved the Oscar for his portrayal of Frodo. He does such a great job. Also, Ian McKellen did a great job of Gandalf. The rest of the acting is great too. The directing is the best thing about this film along with the story. It takes you from place to place so well and vividly...it is amazing. Peter Jackson knew exactly what he wanted to when he walked into doing this film. He had an amazing vision. The music score is also another method of telling this story even stronger. It fits perfectly into any scene they are doing in the movie. If I have left anything out about this film I know why. There is so much I could tell you about this film and how much I love it but I will just point out those things. I cannot wait until ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers"". It looks just as amazing as the first just from the previews. If you have not seen this, go see it NOW. In a theatre or when it arrives on DVD and VHS. 10.0/10.0 A classic"
MaxBorg89,"Dec 11, 2005",10/10,"I've always loved fantasy and science-fiction novels, and I'm very grateful for that, since the movie adaptation of The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the reasons I fell in love with movies (the other reasons are Spider-Man, Casablanca, The Godfather and Pulp Fiction), it's so incredibly excellent. Some people refer to the Lord of the Rings trilogy as my generation's Star Wars (I was 12 when TFOTR was released), but I actually think it's better than Star Wars, and basically for one reason: the way director Peter Jackson has brought Tolkien's beloved classic to the screen.Jackson has perfectly understood CGI is nothing but a tool that enables the filmmaker to tell stories more easily: while in Star Wars we see dozens of different worlds, which are visually stunning but appear for only a couple of minutes (or seconds), in LOTR everything we see is there to make sure the story goes on. Oh, another important thing too: in this movie, plot and character come first, the visuals are added later. The director takes his time to introduce the various inhabitants of Middle Earth and the chain of events that will change their lives forever. The movie is almost three hours long, so what? It's a story we really care about, and the characters make us feel for them every single moment: we cheer with Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) when he learns he won't have to face his difficult task alone; we laugh with them when Merry (Dominic Monaghan) and Pippin (Billy Boyd) make fools of themselves; we cry and worry with them when things start getting bad...That's probably also the reason for which this movie is superior to its sequels (N.B. I'm talking about the so-called ""theatrical versions""): in parts 2 and 3, important moments of character development are ditched in favor of long, breathtaking battles, and the audience knows something's missing. That's not the case of The Fellowship of the Ring: the extended version is better, that's true, but the first movie is the one with the least deleted minutes, and therefore the one that feels less incomplete than the others.As I said before, Jackson values characters more than effects, and he uses the latter only to tell the story more successfully, so that the world where those people live will look more realistic on screen; now, since the characters are more important, the cast is a crucial element, and luckily the actors chosen for this movie are pure perfection: Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Dom Monaghan and Billy Boyd are career-best as the four hobbits, the most vulnerable members of the Fellowship, therefore the ones we care about the most; Viggo Mortensen is 100% convincing as the conflicted, layered Aragorn; Ian McKellen gives Gandalf the Grey the warmth and wisdom he deserves, and finally, Christopher Lee is just THE only actor who could flawlessly play the Darth Vader-like good-turned-bad Saruman, proving once again he's the N°1 choice when it comes to casting someone as the really bad guy. Like Dracula, he has gloriously resurrected to spread horror another time.An amazing beginning for an even more amazing trilogy, perhaps the best I've ever had the pleasure to see. Should have won Best Picture of 2001 (as well as Director and Adapted Screenplay).One ring to rule them all, one ring to find them... well, you know the rest!"
dxia,"Apr 11, 2004",9/10,"The reason why this first part of Jackson's 'Lord of the Rings' is superior to his latter two parts is because of restraint. Jackson was restrained from over doing it with the CGI and ""epic"" battle sequences, which in my opinion does not make a story epic. Part of the reason was simply because Tolkien did not have very many battles in the first part of his book, which thankfully forced Jackson to focus on creating a believable world rather than a believable hack-n-slash action movie.I don't find much entertainment in watching people mutilate each other, but I love it when a movie engages me in a world, and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' does just that. Certainly the most breathtaking scenes in the movie are the moments of patient observation, when the camera pans around and captures the beautiful settings of Middle Earth. I must give Jackson credit. He did hire some very extraordinary artists that have envisioned one of the grandest interpretations of Tolkien's world.There are about five particular moments that stick out in my mind and gave me that tingle of goosebumps down my spine when I saw them for the first time. The first is the introduction to Hobbiton. After the somewhat awkward prologue, I was beginning to have my doubts to whether the movie would live up to the book. But the movie surprised me. Hobbiton is perfect. The houses have flower patches and old fences, the roads look worn and made through decades of travel, and the Old Mill spins with the laziness of a quiet town. Every color is vibrant and every moment looks as through it was taken out of a picture book. Although I still don't agree with the particular look of the Hobbits, I believe everything else in Hobbiton is worthy of Tolkien's words.The second moment comes after Frodo's awakening in Rivendell, and the third, during the exploration of the Halls of Moria. In both moments, the camera pans away from the characters and outward into a static shot of their surroundings. The moments make us feel like we're turning our heads and gazing at the world around us just as the characters do. The golden waterfalls of the elven city mark an interesting contrast with the dark halls of the dwarfish mines, but each are inspiring in their own ways and add to feeling of being engaged in a living world.My other favorite moments come during the exploration of Lothlorien and the passage down the Anduin. And while I won't go into detail about the scenes, since they really should be experienced without any prior expectations, they are monuments in imaginative cinema. 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is one of those rare movies that I always wish I could reexperience for the first time. Unfortunately, Jackson turned away from exploring Middle Earth in his next two movies, and instead, turned to fighting and warfare. He seems to take a lot of pride in the love story and battle sequences he created in 'The Two Towers' and 'The Return of the King,' but it is was in his first movie when he really got it right. In 'The Fellowship of the Ring,' it's okay if the characters are uninteresting and have silly dialogue. Middle Earth is the star, and the characters are the ones seeing it for the first time."
Skeletors_Hood,"Jul 19, 2002",10/10,"I knew from the first time I saw the preview that this was a movie that I wanted to see. Now, I have never picked up a Tolkien book, and the only story I ever knew was the Hobbit, and that was from the animated movie.Now, let me make my observations of some of the reviews listed here, and I must say that everyone is entitled to an opinion, and here is mine.  If you don't like this movie, pronouncing it as boring and too long, then you obviously don't have the patience to watch a great movie, more like you love the hacked off 88 min movie that has no real script to speak of, and only took 2 months to film.  Which is fine, because I like those movies as well,but also I personally love a movie that took a lot of work, and is also very spectacular as a result.  Titanic comes to mind, for one.  I want substance in a movie, and LotR delivers.  It is a true work of art, unlike (someone mentioned ""Fight Club"" ???? A classic?! I think not).  If you only thought of it as boring, then you were only looking for action and no story, in which case the latest Van Damme movie would have fulfilled your expectations.What I truly loved about this movie wasn't just the scenery, but the acting as well.  Each part was brought to life perfectly, and the actors had great chemistry together.  I especially loved Ian as Gandalf, and I must also give a great nod to Christopher Lee, who has always made a great villain.  The action was well placed and suspenseful, and everything looked as I would expect a fantasy world to look like.Overall a very well made movie.  If you hate it, then maybe it's over your head."
JamesRMiles,"Jan 4, 2002",5/10,"If I had been given the means and opportunity to make a Tolkien movie:1.  I would have made the Hobbit first.  Why in the world did this book not get made first?2.  I would have made each Lord of the Rings movie alone, and broken the books up into more manageable chunks (look at the three trilogies of the Star Wars series, for example).  Part I of Book One could be one movie of its own.3.  I would have been more faithful to the books; having less material to cover per movie would have allowed this.The Fellowship of the Ring suffers for having to cover too much material. And for all of its attention to detail, some of the most interesting parts of the book are skipped over, while silly additions like the ""wizard wrestling"" scene and the ""all-seeing eye everywhere"" and Arwen and Aragorn's romance are allowed in.I cannot claim fanatical fan status; I'm very familiar with the Hobbit but only just now I'm finishing the Fellowship of the Ring.  But for all the amazement and wonder I'm finding in the book, I'm more amazed to find so little that is wonderful about the movie.A great book deserved better."
Dbioneer,"Aug 17, 2003",10/10,"As a die-hard aficionado of the trilogy, I subconsciously geared myself for some disappointments on my way to see this film. Some reviewers evidently feel they're breaking new critical ground in saying that the film was compromised, here, there and everywhere, finally excusing and extolling the film on the ground that what's left is so good, the flaws don't really matter much. Well, I can't help but agree, and even at nearly three hours, Jackson and his crew couldn't help but nip and tuck, and so the fact that much was missing, in terms of plot, character development, etc., is not especially mystifying. No, what I wondered--while I stood in line and bought a ticket for three shows hence--was not, ""Gee, did they cut something out?"" but, ""Hmmm. Almost three hours. I wonder how they managed, with so little time."" And they managed just fine, offering concessions and reconciliations equally satisfying, for those who have read the works as well as those who haven't. I do agree that more attention should have been paid to narrative regarding the Council of Elrond--here the plot point reaches a real pitch that was much missed in the film. I don't agree, however, that modern audiences are too cynical to swallow Bombadil. (That's like saying that imagination always needs a reality check.) And I did enjoy the expanded role of Arwen--it fit like a glove, and Tyler's performance, in my opinion, was superb (I had heard rumors that there were some misgivings when she was cast). But in the long run, the source work is so good that there's a heck of lot of choose from. Not only was serious thought given to the adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece, the team's keen eye was clearly focused on the sensibilities (and intelligence) of the audience. Thus this is among the best three hours in film thus far."
philcooper,"Dec 19, 2001",10/10,"There's a very obvious problem when transferring any book to the big screen, namely that some of us may already have seen it.It's not that the story holds no surprises (save for the occasional controversies that surround the fate of characters like Hannibal Lecter), it's just that many of us have already read the book, and thus we've already directed our own version of the story. We've already seen it in our mind's eye.And this is the problem that plagues The Fellowship of The Ring. You'll see a lot of reviews here proclaiming it as nothing short of the second coming of cinema, and a few that dare to knock its serious shortcomings. Let me clear this up right now.The first issue that many may raise is that this is not a faithful adaptation of the book. Quite right, while taking pains to ensure that they stayed faithful to the novel, Jackson et al have not simply been able to lift their screenplay directly from its pages without a few necessary changes. There is a great deal of mindfulness in the film about the portion of the audience (and it will be large) who are unfamiliar with the novels.Accordingly a great deal more emphasis has been placed upon pacing and storytelling more appropriate to a classic film narrative. Hence we need to see Gandalf's protracted bid to escape the clutches of Isenguard interspersed with the Hobbit's journey to Rivendell. It simply isn't appropriate to expect an audience to bear with the Hobbits' journey, no matter how good the actors are or how enthralling the story is, for upwards of an hour without constant reminders of the films other protagonists OR the threat of the evil they face. Having Gandalf just turn up at Rivendell and tell his story via CGI-filled flashbacks simply wouldn't have had the necessary effect.Secondly, the omission and reworking of characters. Yes, it was sad that Bakshi felt his animation didn't need Tom Bombadill, and given that he features strongly in Tolkien's other works this has to be frowned upon by the die-hard fanatics, but introducing diverting, but ultimately pointless episodes into the list of the challenges the Hobbits face is hardly going to keep you riveted to your seat is it? I mean, a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age. The film is already stretching the audience's suspension of disbelief as far as it can go. Hence the chaff of Bombadill is cut. He isn't relevant to the rest of the story so he can be done without. It's sad for Tolkien fans for him not to be there but there's only so much celluloid available, even with a film this long.And yes, Arwen Undomiel never saved Frodo from the Dark Riders, but please, remember your girlfriend needs to have something to sink her teeth into as well, not just midgets and men with beards looking mean or scared as they fight monsters. So, for gender representation and a bid to prevent half the potential market (please remember that like all film, this is a product to be packaged and sold) her character gets a drastic overhaul. Go sister!There are numerous other issues relevant to the faithfulness of the adaptation from novel to screenplay but please, let's be content with what we've got here. It's a hard task to do all this well and Jackson, along with the rest of the boys and girls at Wingnut and WETA, should be commended for what they have achieved.That said there are some definite flaws in the film, even those that can't be overlooked by justifying the needs to relate to the popcorn and nachos audience.Firstly, we've got the Fellowship itself. Now, Merry and Pippin, while not really being established as Frodo's friends and thus not having the same kind of bond with him as they do in the novel are moderately well integrated. However, at the arrival of Boromir, Gimili and Legolas we just get left in the dark. None of these three characters, all representing important races, cultures and locations of the world of Middle Earth are given no more than token arrival-shots to introduce them, and little or no back-story as to how they came to be where they are or why they feel compelled to join Frodo's quest. Offering their various weapons is noble, and it sounds fantastic in the trailer, but when we finally get down to it we just don't know who they are or what they're about. Accordingly we don't ever really have time to care about any of these three, save for Legolas whose fighting proficiency alone makes him stand out. Sadly, Sean Bean is allowed little more than to switch from foreboding bad guy to friendly companion and back again (thus betraying his characters ultimate fate from the first time he opens his mouth) and John Rhys Davis is left with little more to do than scowl and look short. It doesn't help that both these characters seem to get a pretty raw deal for screen time, especially Gimli, who is barely in the film at all. We won't even begin to go into the seemingly superficial relationship we see between Sam and Frodo.All of this is indeed a shame. The film's greatest strength after its story are its strong characters. However, whereas in the book they have the space to develop and flesh themselves out here they have little more to do than look in awe at Gandalf, perhaps not with a humble air so much as a wonder that he's being allowed to soak up all the screen time.And yes, what you've heard is true; the fight sequences are shockingly bad. Well, perhaps that IS an overstatement. The fight sequences aren't exactly bad, they're riddled with good ideas and clever moves, but the camerawork and editing is so erratic that you'll have a hard time picking out anything to inspire awe or respect. The problem here is that the benchmarks for on screen fighting have all been established nowadays by The Matrix, Crouching Tiger and The Phantom Menace, and all of these films use lengthy shots to allow us to soak up the fight imaginative fight choreography, rather than have us crane our necks and dart about the screen with our eyeballs trying to glimpse it like a rare bird or nipple-flash at a premiere.Now, these, yet again, are only a few of the problems. There's the geography of Middle Earth, some ropey special effects moments and the clumsy ending to deal with. But you can read the books and see the film for yourself; I've already typed enough about all that here.BUT, now that I've just spent the main chunk of this review telling you about the shortcomings of The Fellowship of the Rings as both a movie and an adaptation let me tell you, it is good, exceptionally good.There is no denying that the storyline itself, acting, effects, props, sets and so on and so forth are all spot on. Visually the film is a triumph and WETA has now, without question placed itself ahead of Industrial Light and Magic in terms of industry leading special effects. There are bags of style to proceedings, with some sequences displaying the sheer amount of vision of the whole team to bring somewhat vague sections of the novel to life.All parts are played to perfection by the cast, and the casting is literally some of the best and most appropriate seen in years, none of this who-hot-and-who's-not Jerry Bruckheimer trash, it's a case of the best possible person for the part at every stage of the film. We'll give particular credit to Sir Ian Mckellan, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm and Elijah Wood again here. No doubt they've had scores of favourable and loving reviews already but these performances truly are worth mentioning just once again.The film is a masterpiece from start to finish. Yes, it does take perseverance, no it's not entirely faithful to Tolkien's work and there are some serious flaws, but in a year that has been so barren of even five decent mainstream movies I think it's safe to say that no matter when this film had been released it would have outshone its competitors."
spider_webster,"Jun 3, 2005",10/10,"I absolutely love this movie, partly because the acting is really good, but also for the CGI effects and the good storyline. I watched the extended version and realized that it isn't boring like some people think because some people I know think that FOTR is quite a lengthy movie because of all the talking, but in my opinion, if there's not talking, there's no story! If they just jumped to the fighting scenes without any of the introduction, then you won't know where the movie started from. I love the scenes where they get to fight, whether Orcs or Nazgul, the fighting scenes are still the climax of the movie.Another good movie to see after FOTR is TTT, of course. It is the second part of this great trilogy and there are more climatic scenes. Most probably, you'll enjoy that more than FOTR but don't shun this movie just because it's a bit lengthy.Overall, it's a great movie to see and it is really worth spending the money to buy/rent the extended/special DVD to watch too. Definitely a 10 out of 10 on my scale! Actually, in my opinion, 10/10 doesn't even come close!"

lbk,"Jan 5, 2005",6/10,"This film moves nothing. It's Hollywood humdrum done hundreds of times before. A little more computer graphics in this one - and so!?? You get every cliché not one time, not two times but 200 times. What a bargain! Why do I feel the action scenes are trite and tiresome? You have the big strong fearless bad guys coming in by the dozens and they are slaughtered like swatting flies. When they finally get one of our heroes, he doesn't even have the grace of dying in an orderly fashion. He takes blow after blow still standing and then linger on in I don't know how many last words and tear-jerking remarks. Yawn!! Heroes everywhere, please have the courtesy of dying before the audience is killed from boredom.The plot is easy: heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies, heroes enter new game level, kill all bogies (repeat and count for yourselves during 3 hours). This is a glorified computer game, jump-kill, jump-kill, kick-kill, jump-kill ... ad nauseam.And the romance, oh we musn't forget the romance must we? Vision the clever producer with a bit cigar leaning back in the chair getting the original brilliant idea: ""we gotta have a broad in there, she gotta look gorgeous but what's she gonna do? Ahh, hell, doesn't matter ..."" And when you have heard the characters ""I-do-declare"" for half an hour that's enough. The rest is tiresome. In another environment the acting would have been deemed hammy. Why this film is cried out to be the masterpiece of the human history I just can't figure out."

I love the relationships between the characters, and how all the men are portrayed as just so emotionally mature, where they talk about feelings, cry, and hug. These are the type of men that people can look up to.All these three movies will forever be my personal favourite. They are also what introduced me to the writings of Tolkien, since I saw the movies long before I read the book(s)."

Granted, I have never seen any of the films, but seeing clips from it during various awards ceremonies and things like that tell me I never want to see any of them, the originals included. I'm also not a big fan of fantasy films, so it was pretty damn daring of me to make that statement in the summary box.The thing is, The Fellowship of the Ring just REEKS with brilliance. Every single second of the movie is astounding, from the first battlefield scene until the last few scenes. I don't need to watch any other fantasy flicks to know that this is the best.Now, I'm not a Tolkien reader. I bought ""FOTR"" after watching the film and watching a National Geographic documentary on his life. I've owned the book for maybe 3 months now, and so far I'm still at page 94, thereabout. But I have seen the movie 3 times. And each time, it just got better. Peter Jackson deserves all the best director awards the industry could ever give for his beautiful masterpiece. How he managed not to get the Golden Globe for Best Director is beyond me. Actually, how anyone can think that this picture is anything but brilliant is beyond me. 3-hours too long? Hell no. 3-hours too short.I truly hope the Academy awards Mr. Jackson for his great eye for detail, and all-round awesome direction, and I sincerely think this movie is Best Picture material. The acting is also superb. I've always liked Elijah Wood, but I loved him in this. Not only are his eyes beautiful, he is able to speak volumes with them. I don't understand how the Academy and the rest have managed to overlook him for a Best Actor award. Orlando Bloom is devastatingly gorgeous as Legolas. He has captured the hearts of teenaged girls the whole world over, myself included. You can't blame us. Legolas is the perfect man you'd want by your side in times of danger. His movements are agile, like a cat's, and you couldn't tell in the movie that Bloom has taken only 2 (or was it 3?) months of archery classes. My only gripe about the character was that there wasn't much developement in the movie. I hope we'd get to see more of Legolas in the coming two movies, which I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE. Viggo Mortensen was dashingly handsome as Aragorn, Sir Ian McKellan radiated gentleness and his Best Supporting SAG award was well-deserved, and the hobbits were excellent. You simply cannot fault the acting, or any other aspects of this movie. I love everything about the film, from its breath-taking sceneries to the grotesque appearances of the orcs to Howard Shore's beautiful music. EVERYTHING!The only -- and I truly mean only -- negative thing I have to say about the trilogy is that they're making me wait an entire year for the next part. It's like feeding me a piece of delicious cake and taking the rest away, and then telling me, ""You'd get the next bite next year."" The cake is lovely, and I want to eat it whole, all at once.And to anyone who wonders why ""FOTR"" is best picture material: it draws you in, it makes you care whether the characters lived or died, and it gets under your skin and refuses to leave until the whole movie is over. It stays in your mind when it's over, and you know you want to go back and relive every moment of that wonderful journey you were a part of. Three times.All hail ""The Lord of the Rings""."
G'aal,"Jun 23, 2002",10/10,"Reading through the various posts, I see that the overriding theme amongst the movie's few detractors was that it was ""overly long"" and ""boring"", even prompting one poster to rename the movie ""Bored of the Rings.""Well, these people clearly haven't read the books and thus are not Tolkien fans.  J.R.R. Tokien's books are VERY long and descriptive, and even the hard core fan has to wade through certain elements.  However, the books are thrilling, sweeping epics, microcosms of the age-old struggles between good and evil.  In this context, Tolkien has created a complete alternate world, populated by humans and similarly-evolved races such as elves, dwarves and hobbits, and mixes courage, determination, love and magic to create ""Middle Earth"".Lord of the Rings:  The Fellowship of the Ring accomplishes what no film maker dared attempt in the 47 years.  It encapsulates the first book of the trilogy in jaw-dropping fashion onto film.  And that bears repeating:  the movie is so amazing, so awe-inspiring, so wondrous that through much of the movie, I felt my jaw literally dropping open.  It's THAT good.The cast is nearly perfect:  Ian McKellan *is* perfect as Gandalf the Grey. The standoff at the Bridge of Khazad-Dum will go down with the alien's tail slowly encircling Lambert in ""Alien"", the initial emergence of the creature from the black lagoon and other horror/fantasy epic moments as one of the all-time great scenes in cinematic history.  Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, Elijah Wood, Liv Tyler, Ian Holm, Cate Blanchett and the rest of the remarkable ensemble cast give the performances of their careers.  The special effects, despite some that claim otherwise, leave the viewer on the edge of their seat throughout.  And the good news is that since the movie has grossed over $800 million world-wide to date, the second and third installments of the trilogy will benefit with post-production special effects improvements.If you haven't seen this movie, you've missed out, big time, unless you can find it still playing somewhere.  The big screen is far and away the best place to view this masterpiece, especially sitting up close.  I saw it three times in the theaters and would see it again today if it were playing nearby.  And I know where I'll be the day ""The Two Towers"" is released:  in my local theater, sitting close, watching yet another epic bit of storytelling unfold.A gigantic 10 out of 10."
Mediatation,"Jun 1, 2025",10/10,"The first film in Peter Jackson's epic adaptation of J. R. R. Tolkien's legendary ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy brings the magic of Middle-earth to the big screen, introducing many viewers to one of the most monumental fantasy stories ever told. ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a masterclass in world-building that sets the standard for fantastical group quests, perfectly capturing the spirit of adventure.The casting of all the beloved characters is outstanding, with each actor convincingly portraying the wide range of emotions and thoughts found in the novel-especially Elijah Wood, whose performance as Frodo is central to the film's emotional core. ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is a warm welcome to the trilogy and will have viewers hooked, whether it's their first or fiftieth journey to Middle-earth."
MAYESY-44,"May 27, 2020",10/10,The perfect start to a perfect trilogy. Well thought out and focused on getting the characters across. Lord of the rings is a much watch trilogy.
Aggi-3,"Dec 7, 2001",10/10,"Well, what can I say? I had high expectations and was worried that I would be disappointed, this is Lord of the rings after all. Peter Jackson pulled it off big time, surpassed my expectations. He takes my favorite book and brings it to live on the screen and sucks me so right into it that I was feeling shellshocked afterwards. It was definately the best movie of the year and it's wonderfull beyond belief. When I walked out I just wanted to go back in and see it again. There are no words who can describe what I felt when I watched it and the only complaints I got about it, it ends and I'll have to wait for one year to see the next one. Peter Jackson, I salute you!"
Fergoose,"May 22, 2004",6/10,"A wonderful book, it was always going to be difficult to recreate it on the big screen. Whilst there is no denying the quality of the recreation of Middle Earth, this film is not without its bad points.Firstly, incidental music. Why so much? Can two characters not have an interaction without an orchestra dithering along in the background. Can actors not generate emotion without having to rely on music? I have never heard such an abundance of unnecessary music, at times it was reminiscent of a cheap Australian soap opera.Secondly, the acting. Whilst it is commendable to not select well known actors for every role, some of the actors, were simply not up to scratch and were unable to muster any sense of empathy in this disgruntled reviewers stoney heart.Thirdly, the love-interest *sighs*. Why must a mainstream film always shoe-horn in a wholly redundant love interest? Yes, it was in the book, but it was over-egged here.Fourth, Sam - please lord no! The main reason why I cannot even face the other two installments.In short, could have been great, but let down by irritating points which could have easily been avoided by better casting and more sensible use of music.4 out of 10"
geza-8,"May 22, 2003",1/10,"I am a big fan of Tolkien's books, but the movie doesn't do justice to them at all and actually is a major annoyance. The scenery and most of the personae are actually depicted very nicely, but as soon as acting and talking starts it becomes plain that the story has been cut, changed, dumbed down, and vulgarized to such a degree that nothing is left of Tolkien's masterpiece and what remains is just an over-length,  fantasy film with a thin story and boring characters.The film has the subtlety of a sledgehammer, its fundamental assumptions seem to be: (1) if a danger is such that the heroes just might escape then it's no real danger and must be enlarged to ridiculous proportions. (2) Comic relief can only be achieved through slapstick of the crudest kind. (3) Battle scenes must last at least as long as it would take a five-year-old to read the corresponding passages backward in Chinese. Moreover, if they could be done without special effects they are bad and must be ""enhanced"". (4) A traitor must walk around with a sign saying ""I am a traitor"".The worst example for this lack of subtlety is that the Ring is handled much too often, too openly, and with too little care. This trivializes the sinister and threatening item and takes away much of the power of the story.The reckless exaggeration in the ""action scenes"" is equally awful. Case in point the ""Gate of Moria""-scene, when the Watcher gives Frodo a ride     in the merry-go-round until everyone had a chance to hack at him; the more restrained story in the book is much more effective IMHO. Similarly mutilated are the scenes: ""Crossing of the Brandywine"", ""Cutting Cushions in Bree"", ""The Burning of the Riders"" at Weathertop, ""The Drowning of Sam Gamgee"", ""Wizards slug it out in Orthanc"", and, of course, ""They have a Cave Troll"", and, really, all of Moria.The main hero, Frodo, gives the impression of a loser: all the scenes in which (in the book) he shows courage, wisdom, resolve are cut or changed. Worst i find this in the key scenes in the Barrow (cut) and at Weathertop. There is nothing in the film giving any hint why Frodo might be ""the best Hobbit in the Shire"".Due to the many cut or twisted scenes, more than half of the characters have little resemblance to the ones in Tolkien's LotR: Frodo is a loser, Merry and Pippin are idiots until they suddenly turn out to be warrior princes, Elrond appears to be permanently pissed off -- as if everything ""... stinks!"", Strider is just another warrior hero (his being a loremaster, a healer, the ""greatest traveller of our time"" etc. does not show), Galadriel and Lorien is done so badly that i wish it would have been cut completely (""more fair than thought of mortal men"" is a tall order, but Jackson does not even manage ""fair""). Only Gandalf, Bilbo, and Saruman are rendered more or less well.I could go on, nearly every scene has gone wrong. Nothing of the depth of Tolkien's vision, the attention he paid to details (not only visual but to fine-tuning the development of the main characters) or the poetry in his creation is conveyed. What remains of the story is not told in a very coherent or convincing fashion, neither the acting nor the special effects are remarkable.All in all, a complete and utter failure to turn a great book into a movie."
bowmanblue,"Jan 8, 2020",10/10,"The word 'epic' probable gets used too much these days to describe films. However, in this case it's definitely right. For those two people out there who don't know, 'The Lord of the Rings' is (primarily, excluding various 'spin-off' books) a trilogy of long books set in a fiction world called 'Middle Earth' which is filled with everything from wizards to dragons (yes, think 'Game of Thrones,' but with less nudity.It had long been considered that J. R. R. Tolkien's books were 'unfilmable' due to no screen adaptation being able to bring his lavish world to life (properly). There was an animated attempt (which wasn't as bad as people made out), but due to budgetary reasons, it was left unfinished (a concept which left me particularly confused when I watched it as a child). However, now the source material has finally been given the big screen treatment it deserved and 'The Fellowship of the Ring' is the start of the trilogy's life in mainstream cinema.Despite the long backstory (shown in a brief montage/history lesson at the beginning of the film) all you need to know is that the spirit of a 'dark lord' wants his magic ring back in order to become whole again and generally take over the land. However, by luck the piece of jewellery in question is in the hands of a gentle race of little creatures known as 'hobbits.' They, together with an assortment of men, wizards, dwarfs and elves, vow to prevent the dark lord Sauron from getting his property back and set off on a quest to destroy it in the fires of the volcano where it was once forged.I suppose you could call the cast an 'ensemble.' With a story that requires so many characters, quite a few familiar faces will pop up. Primarily you have Sir Ian McKellen as the iconic wizard, Gandalf the Grey, but he's backed up by everyone from Cate Blanchett and Christopher Lee to Sean Bean and Viggo Mortensen. In fact it's more a case of the more 'famous' Hollywood actors are secondary to the two hobbits who are at the centre of the tale, Frodo and Sam, plays by Elijah Wood and Sean Aston respectively. They're possibly less well-known that the affore-mentioned actors and yet rise to the challenge and prove that they're more than capable of having a major cinematic franchise rest on their (miniature!) shoulders.The cast is perfectly surrounded by some of the best sets, scenery and special effects ever to be committed to the big screen at the time (yes, you can - sort of - see a bit of 'green screen' work these days, but they still hold up!). Some say that the whole trilogy is one giant advert for the New Zealand tourist board, as it makes use of all the country's different landscapes to great effect.Of course seeing as 'Fellowship' is the first in a trilogy, there a certain amount of 'set up' contained where some story threads are mentioned but never expanded on - yet. However, this never really stops anyone from understanding what's going on and I'm sure once you watch this installment you'll want to know where it all goes!I know that the real 'Tolkien purists' will argue about which bits from the book have either been left out, or slightly changed, like making an Elf maiden an outright warrior in the film. I've read the books and, due to their length, it would probably be impossible to commit every last page to screen (unless you make every film about six hours!) and what they've done is taken all the most important points and used them to great effect to make the story as accessible to as many people as possible.I think it was writer/director Kevin Smith who said in 'Clerks II' that the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy was just basically 'people walking.' Okay, so funny as that may be (and - technically - true) there's so much more to the film that just that. The best part about 'Fellowship' (and indeed the whole trilogy) is that it can be enjoyed by most people, not just fans of the book or the genre, but also appreciated by (nearly) everyone with an eye for good cinema due to its achievements in world-building and sheer scale."
NateW,"Jul 2, 2002",10/10,"The long awaited live action adaption of the classic Tolkein novel Lord of the Rings more than justified the massive hype surrounding it. Simply put, it is one of the best movies I've ever seen. I have not been so utterly blown away by a film in a long time like I was when I saw this. Every, and I mean every, aspect of this film is executed flawlessly. The ensemble performances are truly fantastic, especially by Wood and McKellan. All I can say is I can't wait for it to be released on DVD and I can't wait for The Two Towers and Return of the King to come to theatrical release. I think we have finally seen the arrival of a trilogy that matches the magnitude of the original Star Wars trilogy. 10/10"
rayhawthorne,"Feb 9, 2022",10/10,"I was born in 1999. This trilogy came out in 2001, 2002, & 2003.I had older brothers who saw these in theaters (jealous)! They got them on vhs tape and watched them every weekend while babysitting me while our parents worked.By the time I was 5 (2004), I had seen this trilogy many times. After we'd watch them, we played the PS2 video games. Fun memories.As time went on, my brothers got into trouble. Ironic how the films they introduced me to helped me through the tough times that they caused.I am grateful to them for only that. Without LOTR, I don't know where I'd be. The strength of these beautiful characters has helped me persevere. Tolkien was a genius! I've read almost the whole trilogy. And played the games countless times.Peter Jackson is as genius as Tolkien. You can tell he really took his time to honor this man's unique universe. The excellent casting, costuming, wigs, props, EVERYTHING!The fact that the actors had to learn to speak properly, and speak Elvish. And how to do combat.From what I remember, there are hardly any differences between book and film. And those that are, are understandable.Jackson did Tolkien justice. If anyone tries to recreate this trilogy, I WILL riot.I'm going to devote a whole paragraph to the music. Howard Shore was a gamble considering he'd never done anything like this before. But did Jackson win big with that gamble!The music is one of THE most memorable film scores out there! You hear it and you know it. That's the sign of a talented musician. Even my mom knows the music and can even respect the material. And she doesn't like fantasy.I adore all the detail put into these cinematic masterpieces that still don't look dated. The voice acting, cgi and green screen blend so well into what's real, you find yourself in the real world looking around in disbelief that an Ent isn't outside your door!Thank you Peter Jackson! Thank you crew! Thank you cast! Thank you Howard Shore! And especially thank you to J. R. R. Tolkien. May your memory and universe live on forever!"

thierryserra-05310,"Jun 14, 2019",10/10,"I'm a huge fan of medieval fantasy. And J. R. R. Tolkien is the father of the genre. I read the book and lived it. But when the movie aired, it blew my mind. Many scenes were exactly as I had imagined them, and many were way better.
Direction is flawless, performances are extraordinary, photography is breath taking with incredible locations and the story is perfectly narrated. And the music is incredible. Enya's song brings tears to my eyes.
The only thing you could ask of this movie is more! But wait... there IS more. Two more movies follow AND if you buy the DVD special edition, you get 30 more minutes of film. Well worth it. You get to see the hobbits actually fight and even kill a few orcs.
One of the best fantasy movies ever."
asticht-2,"Aug 9, 2005",10/10,"For those of you like myself who are fans of the books of the same name,you will not be disappointed by this movie. Unlike the animated versions that have previously been made where much of the story was condensed either for budgetary constraints or time limits, the Fellowship of the Ring while it does take a few shortcuts, there are very few. It is very exciting getting to see places that up until now have been purely figments of my imagination portrayed by someones elses imagination on the silver screen. I felt myself holding my breath waiting to see the various locations of middle earth and how others have dreamed of them. The movie does a breathtaking job in transporting the viewer to this other world and does so with magic good enough to be from the hand of Gandalf himself. Yes, there are places where for dramatic reasons or to prevent a lengthy historical context that certain events from the book were either shortened, modified or changed. These changes however do not change the storyline itself and makes for a very entertaining movie. I do feel however that if you are one of the uninitiated, it would serve you to either read the book before going, or immediately after the film pick up a copy and read it as it will provide more breadth to the story than what an almost three hour film can portray. In addition, there are several scenes in the book that while not central to the main story, add more to the lore of middle earth and help to explain some of the history leading up to the time of the story. The characterizations in the film were very well done and the choices of the actors to play the hobbits were perfect. While I was somewhat anxious to have Elijah Wood as Frodo and Sean Astin as Samwise, after seeing how well they were portrayed on film left me no doubt that these actors did a very admirable job bringing the characters to life. The majority of the cast has some English accent which was my main concern. Both the principle American actors portrayed a passable English type accent themselves which helped prevent them standing out on their own. How the filmmakers made several average height men such as Wood and Astin, and probably more so John Rhys Davies as Gimli appear much smaller than their Elvish or human companions is spellbinding. Special effects in this movie while at first don't really seem to be that obvious eventually take on a more obvious tone as the fellowship moves further into the adventure. As one would expect from a magical world, many things which we take for granted from reading the books are very difficult to accurately portray in a live action presentation. The filmmakers not only did a good job, they surpassed by far my expectations and truly made the experience an enjoyable and fulfilling one. As with any film where there will be sequels coming out, the ending left me longing for December 2002 to follow our adventurers further on their quest.I will caution parents who are thinking of taking their children to see this movie that it is not a movie made or intended for children. Much Parental Guidance and forethought should be taken before taking children under 12 to this film. Aside from a film which lasts almost three hours in length where much of the dialogue while important to the story is not well suited to entertain small children. In addition, several of the creatures created for the film will probably terrify younger audiences. If you want to take your children to see this film, I might caution you to view it without them first and then decide to take them on your own judgement. Hey, if you do see it first without them, you can see it again right? I plan on seeing it more than once anyway. All in all, this is a well developed motion picture where a great deal of thought went into it's development and execution. I am thankful to the filmmakers for having the courage to tackle such a well known, well loved story with an audience that has a very well organized preconceived notion of how they view the world of Tolkien. The filmmakers did the book justice and that is the bottom line unlike Bakshi's version of 1978 which was a disappointment at best and unfinished as it's final release turned out to be."
pyrocitor,"Apr 3, 2006",10/10,"The Fellowship of the RingWhen one begins to write one's sentiments regarding a movie such as Peter Jackson's adaptation of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic Lord of the Rings trilogy, the main problem isn't having difficulty finding things to remark upon - the main problem is knowing where to begin. The Fellowship of the Ring essentially redefined the term ""quality"", in its extraordinary ability to vastly succeed the already unreasonably high expectations of audiences and die-hard fans of the novels everywhere.It becomes difficult to avoid bias by painting the film with outlandish and likely unreasonable praises, but I must confess I could go on for literally pages pointing out how blown away I still am by virtually every aspect of this movie, the first, and in my opinion, strongest as a film of the trilogy. So I'll try to keep it concise - Jackson has truly brought the novels to life in a fashion one could never have imaged short of actually seeing it for themselves. The sets and appearance of Middle Earth are among the greatest ever created, an impeccable blend of CGI, constructed sets, and the already breathtaking landscapes of beautiful New Zealand. The beautiful cinematography brings this all to light again, in the best sense of the word - seldom does a movie look so, simply put, beautiful. The costumes and appearances of the various creatures and inhabitants of Middle Earth are once again, mind-blowing - some of the best and most convincing computer generated images are on display in these movies. This is all punctuated by Howard Shore's simply gorgeous and incredibly moving Oscar winning score.Acting is also simply nothing less than astounding, with every cast member not only seeming torn straight out of the pages of the novels, born to play their role, but also turning out pretty much flawless performances around the board. There are standouts of course, especially Sir Ian McKellan's now career defining turn as the warm yet incredibly wise and powerful wizard Gandalf, Viggo Mortenson's wonderful flawed yet noble hero Aragorn, Sean Bean's excellent and truly touching portrayal of the quintessential flawed male character Boromir, Elijah Wood as the good hearted lead character, the innocent hobbit Frodo Baggins, and Sean Aston as his faithful and loyal companion Samwise, and Christopher Lee as the corrupted and now evil wizard Saruman the White. Cate Blanchett is a huge scene-stealer, as the regal (and briefly chilling) elf queen Galadriel, while John Rhys-Davies is perfectly gruff and hilarious as cantankerous dwarf Gimli, and Liv Tyler is breathtakingly elegant as Arwen (and thankfully given more to do than simply stand around pining, as in the next two films). Then there is of course the absurdly underrated Andy Serkis' mind blowing portrayal of the creature Gollum. Though mainly seen in the next two films, Serkis already manages to make a powerful first impression with his 2 minutes or less of screen time.Again, it seems entirely fair to say the Lord of the Rings movies are among the greatest movies ever made, for their incredibly detailed attention to the details of Tolkien's novels, and their still surprising ability to exceed expectations in every possible way in film-making and storytelling terms. This is epic storytelling at its best - if you are among the very few who have yet to see these movies, strongly consider doing so - it will be well worth your while.-10/10"
Xstal,"Apr 3, 2023",7/10,"There's a ring that's been residing in a pocket, provides longevity to Bilbo who's a Hobbit, but it's waiting to be found, by Sauron to which it's bound, you need the fires of Mount Doom, if you're to stop it. Frodo (who has been given the ring by Bilbo) and his chums go on a journey, become pursued by an increasingly large army, comprising orcs and nasty wraiths, hunting them down from place to place, it's quite bizarre, and very often, a bit barmy. They're supported on this quest by Dwarves and Elves, plus there are people very similar to ourselves, and a wizard with a beard, has a hat that's quite dog-eared, some have magic, on occasion they cast spells."
Clavicle13,"Jan 3, 2005",3/10,"Due to popular demand, some of the reasons why Lord of the Rings is a poor film :This movie is so stifled by nonsense and Hollywood tricks that it's hard to discern, beneath it, the work of a purportedly intelligent, talented, and celebrated author beneath it.To begin with: there are way too many closeups in this movie. Why couldn't Peter Jackson simply let us stand back and watch the characters behave? Why does the camera have to keep poking into the characters' faces, looking for subtle clues? Maybe Jackson's been spending too much time watching the moronic trash of Spielberg, the most overrated director of all time who still hasn't learned how to let go of the audience's hand.The melodramatic soundtrack, far from sustaining or assisting the story, cheapens it and, as Spielberg is so adept at doing, leads me to believe that the intended audience is probably those people who don't like to think too hard. This film would've been far improved if Jackson had simply left out the lousy soundtrack.The special effects generally do not add anything to the story.And there is plenty of plain illogical nonsense in here. For one example, i think we can all agree that it's physically impossible for a human being to outrun an absolutely normal, healthy horse. If a person is being followed at full gallop by a horse, the horse will always catch up. Also, i always have trouble swallowing scenes wherein one or two people capably defeat an army of assailants counting ten, twenty, or more, unless these one or two heroes or heroines happen to have superhuman traits or at least an extraordinarily exceptional degree of training. I'm not aware of whether or not this sort of occurrence is consistent with the actual text, but as i watch the film, i can't help feeling lost in all of Jackson's nonsense.And so much swooping! Why so much swooping? More Spielberg influence. I admit there's also swooping in Heavenly Creatures, but by now his swooping has become quite distracting. Why can't we just watch the characters? Isn't Jackson supposed to be telling us a story?I like Jackson's earlier films, and Heavenly Creatures is a brilliant and compelling one, and clearly his best. But now he's off remaking King Kong... maybe he's gotten lost in Hollywood. Someone please help him find his way out!Peter Jackson had the potential of making a great film which could've lasted many decades as a classic, but instead he made a sloppy moneymaker. What a loss.But then again, perhaps this movie was made for children.On the plus side, the pretty New Zealand landscapes are nice to look at."
manherz,"Jul 1, 2005",10/10,It is incredibly difficult to really adapt most books into movies and still stay very true to the soul of the book. This movie does that in a very big way and really sets the mode for the following two movies. It is the hook and bait that is irresistible and even those that don't care for fantasy movies find themselves reeled into one of the greatest epic fantasy's ever told. Entering a world filled with new discoveries and incredible adventures is something that every child hopes for and thats exactly what sparked the creation of this epic. Watching this movie really brought me back to a time when life was magical and my imagination was all I needed to enjoy each day. Very few movies are able to immerse a person and make them feel very much apart of the story that is being told like this movie does.
Puroo,"Jun 21, 2021",10/10,"I had begun watching The Lord of the Rings because of all the memes and references in other movies and shows. And that was probably an excellent decision. It has been a year since I have watched these and since the story is distributed among all the three movies, I have decided that I will talk about something unique each of them. In total these movies clock over 10 hours, and I can imagine how much the fans of the book must have loved it when they learnt they are getting so much content from a book they love reading so much.The Fellowship of the Ring is the very first one of the movies which basically kickstarts the adventure. It is amazing to see how much content this movie has in spite of the fact that the entire backstory was narrated in the first two minutes of the beginning. There are a lot of things to talk about in this. The movie created a font style, a score and a colour palette that fits along with the scenes of the battle that made it look so suspenseful. As the scene was going on I was very attentive to hear everything that happens throughout. And this was just the first two minutes of the 3 hour movie.Afterwards the scene transitioned to the otherwise peaceful Hobbiton. It was a very interesting transition, that showed how on one hand the races are fighting each other for getting control over the Middle Earth, while on the other hand there are a bunch of peace loving Hobbits who are just into their day to day lives. They always have very wholesome reactions when they see Gandalf, which is the reason why it creates a stark contrast from what is about to happen after they leave Hobbiton. Although Bilbo was a good friend of Gandalf and Gandalf had come all the way to celebrate his birthday, he didn't feel that Bilbo was a trustworthy person because he was also attached to the ring. As a result he decided to send his nephew Frodo, his friend Sam and two other Hobbits to help dispose of the ring.The ring is also something I'd like to talk about here, since it is in this movie that the ring and its effects have been talked about the most. The ring is something that appeals to anyone who has desires, but once it is worn it ends up tormenting the wearer. The subtle message that this sends us is the consequence of a moment's greed. Not everyone has the ability to hold their temptation, which is the reason why the Hobbits are specifically sent to dispose of it. Frodo himself has the urge to wear it twice, the reason being that he wanted to save himself. At one moment he wears it accidentally during a bar fight, which makes him see the Eye of Modor and makes him vulnerable. If one is able to get over their desires and focus on what makes their life easy, there will be no need of such temptations. This is what the ring tells us.And afterwards they go to Rivendell, which is, simply said, the most beautiful place I have ever seen in my whole life in any movie! Over there they create The Fellowship of the Ring, which goes to destroy the ring in the lava at the Mountain of Doom. Now I won't get too much into the story since I want to keep this review spoiler-free, so I'm just gonna talk about how beautiful all the scenes from this movie are. Seeing them reminded me of my childhood, reading nursery rhymes and fairy tales. I always looked at the pictures and imagined this is what those places must have looked like. Every location from this movie looks like it could be one of those 19th century paintings. It's amazing to see such places are still left in this world that have not been destroyed as of yet.The movie, or should I say the trilogy, has really gone hard with the details. They chose to make the maps, the fonts, the detailed lore, all the cities from the Middle Earth and even the easter eggs which added a lot of lore to the movie. Every scene from the movie looks like a painting, which is not something which can be said about most adventure fantasy movies. It has the feeling of an RPG game to it, or at least that's how I feel it. It's something of a Skyrim of all movies. For the fans this must have felt like a dream coming true. Things like these should be made for all fantasy movies, which have begun looking underworked simply because of the existence of this movie.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is not a movie that I may want to watch again because of how long it was and the fact that it is nothing in itself unless the other two parts are also combined, but this is also for a good thing because of the fond memories that this movie has left for me. Personally this was the most memorable movie for me among the trilogy. It was because of how rich and detailed this movie was that gave me the confidence of watching the other two movies as well, something I rarely do otherwise. There are many iconic movies like The Godfather, Jurassic Park and Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs which I did like, but they didn't give me the courage to continue. This is going to be one of those classical movies that I'd remember for life."
claudio_carvalho,"Sep 1, 2003",10/10,"In my opinion this is the best movie of fantasy and adventure ever made. The journey of Frodo Baggins and the Fellowship of the Ring is outstanding, stunning, a masterpiece. I believe there is nothing else to be said about this fantastic movie. My vote is ten."

juliegi,"Mar 22, 2002",10/10,"I think this is the best film of 2001. As an avid fan of the J.R.R. Tolkein novels, I was excited to see these being made into films. I was not disappointed by the movie which followed the books pretty faithfully without getting too long and drawn out. All of the acting was great and the special effects well-done. I cannot wait to see the 2nd and 3rd films."
rob_hyland49,"Apr 18, 2002",10/10,"I love this film. I simply love it. This is Tolkiens novel, and the world of Middle-Earth, the characters of Middle-Earth and the events of Middle-Earth! I love this film.This is the kind of film that will be passed down from generation to generation to generation. It is THAT good.There are three wizards: Gandalf (Sir Ian McKellen), Saruman (Christopher Lee) and Peter Jackson, the director. The breathtaking detail Jackson has put into this is incredible. Lets start with the acting.This is a star studded cast, with Elijah Wood in the main role as Frodo, McKellen as mentioned, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Bean, Billy Boyd, Liv Tyler . .. the list goes on and on and on. Each has put 101% into this masterpiece, and it really shows.The sets are incredible. One can believe they are in Khazad-Dum, or in Bree, or in Hobbiton, or Rivendell particuarly. It will take your breath away, some of the incredible locations. We know each is not real, but there is a hint of realism in there.This is a special effects bananza, used only when needed. In Khazad-Dum and Isengard particuarly you can almost feel the power given off by the magic in this film.The costumes are perfect. The score (designed by Howard Shore) is breathtakingly beautiful. And throughout this, Jackson maintains a sense of calm and reality in the film, and it is this inner flare and outer cool that makes him and the entire cast and crew the magicians that they are. Probably the greatest motion picture of cinema history. 10+ out of 10."
Nov181973,"Aug 7, 2002",10/10,"Truly one of the best films ever made!  It was robbed of the best picture Academy award. This movie does not disappoint.  Even those who are not fans of the books, love this movie.  Set back and hold on to something, you are going to love this from beginning to end. The only thing wrong with this movie, is the waiting for the next one."
MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,"Jul 26, 2021",10/10,"There can be little doubt that the Lord of the Rings film are the greatest trilogy of all time. At the time of writing the films sit on the top 250 at 7th, 10th, and 14th. No other trilogy is so highly rated. The Godfather Part III is nowhere to be seen on the Top 250.Peter Jackson + Howard Shore + The the amazing actors (every single one was absolutely brilliant, from Elijah Wood to Marton Csokas. Not to mention all the stunt doubles, special effects team, editors all all others who made this film/these films what they are. And a special thanks to the country of New Zealand for being so very beautiful!This is my favourite film of all time, no doubt about it, there are no criticisms that I believe are valid!"
mohamedmahmoudgalalmahmoud,"Jun 20, 2020",6/10,"At the end of this movie, it made me wonder what is the nature of drama and science fiction building for this movie or series.
Throughout this film - which was relatively long in length - he did not explain the importance of each individual and what dimensions would happen if we lost any of them, but he answered himself, is that if we lost any character if he affected us, some characters were interchangeable and without a dramatic build that made me not Sympathy for any character who died, what is the benefit of inserting characters and disposing of them without any dramatic construction that makes us sympathize with them? This is however, it took a long time for us to know the characters presented
As for building this world itself, it carries a lot of problems, such as how important is my knowledge of the number of rings that were made, or what is the importance of the people who carry them, the whole idea focused on one ring! Or what is the importance of those rings basically!
The film suffers from defects on the level of visual effects, and the solution was that they color the film with exaggerated colors in order to hide these defects.
On the level of events, and after reviewing it in my mind after finishing the film, I did not find anything that would serve the future development of events. The film was weak in exposing the dimensions of the world in which the story tells all that happened is to show the skills of characters in adventures that have no cause or meaning in three hours And half.
I did not like the way magic was cast and it was totally unattractive compared to other films like Harry Potter, and by the way Harry Potter was in the same year and it had much better visual effectsIn the end, I liked the original score and sounds and the cinematography, the movie gave us some wonderful staff"
tone-23,"Dec 28, 2001",2/10,"I really tried to go into this movie with an open mind.  I knew that much would be left out due to time restrictions.  I was aware through the promotional campaign that the dialog was going to be un-Tolkien, for reasons I wasn't clear about, since they seem to have gone to considerable effort to get pronunciations correct.  I knew that there would be many things about both the story and the treatment of it that would conflict with my own hide-bound (some would say fossilized) ideas.But still I looked forward to it.Then they showed Sauron in the second shot of the movie and somewhere inside, I wailed in despair.   I knew, from that alone, that Peter Jackson didn't get it.What is the one thing in LOTR that is never shown?  The one thing so evil and horrible that it isn't even described?Sauron.  The title character.  The Lord of the Rings himself.There he is, in the second shot of the movie.  Some funny looking big guy whose armourer has either very very bad taste or a sick sense of humor.The whole prologue was very aggravating to me, because as I watched it I knew that both the structure of the story and the slow building of understanding that characterized Tolkien's telling of it were being ignored. Throughout ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" (the book, that is) we see the story unfold largely through Frodo's eyes.  We don't know about the conspiracy between Merry, Pippin and Sam because Frodo doesn't.  We don't know who the Black Riders are because Frodo doesn't.  And we don't know the history of the Ring until Gandalf tells Frodo about it.  Putting us in the hobbit's shoes brings us into the story.  The prologue in the movie separates us from it.On a technical level, the cinematography and editing were completely wrong for a story of this type -- other than a few wide sweeping shots of the fellowship walking south from Rivendell, the movie seemed all wide-angle lenses, swish pans, jump cuts, Spike Lee zooms (zooming in while dollying back or vice versa) or gratuitous and excessive special effects.  When Frodo puts the ring on, why does it suddenly get windy?  I rather think Bilbo would have noticed something was odd about the ring if all that had happened when he put it on.  Almost without exception, all the special effects were over-the-top.  From the glow of the fiery letters shining on Frodo's face (which, I will admit, looked kind of cool) to the flaming eye of Sauron.In a word, the film lacked subtlety.  Tolkien would have been hopping mad.And Arwen at the bridge made me mad, too.  In the book, Frodo stands, weak and wounded on the opposite shore from the Nazgul, and yet with his remaining strength defies them.  This is a crucially important moment in his development and our understanding of his character.Though the waves with horses was a nice touch.Speaking of Arwen at the bridge, there are many annoying examples of small changes to the plot done for no apparent reason.  Why was it Frodo who figured out how to open the gates of Moria?  And why wasn't Sam at the mirror of Galadriel?  Why did Aragorn show up before the orcs finished off Boromir (actually, that one's obvious -- so we could waste more time with another damn fight scene, that's why)?  and why was he not present when the black riders attacked the hobbits at Weathertop?It is possible to transfer a book successfully to screen faithfully.  For example, ""Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone"" does an admirable job.  I gave the movie a seven out of ten and full marks for keeping within both the letter and the spirit of the book.  It left some things out, but you could tell that the filmmakers respected the book, the author, and the book's legion of readers.Several key dynamics from LOTR were thrown out in the movie.  The whole business of the mysterious disappearance of Gandalf is left out, and replaced with one of the most bone-jarringly stupid scenes in the film: I call it Gandalf vs. Saruman in the temple of Doom.  Was that silliness necessary?  The Wizards in the film may have been quick to anger, but subtle they most decidedly were not.The Legolas-Gimli relationship was likewise ignored, as well as the process of Aragorn gaining the hobbits' trust (especially Sam's).   But this simply underscores the greatest weakness in the movie -- it doesn't build the characters, it takes them for granted.And what of poor Barliman?  He was given such short shrift.  Not to mention Tom Bombadil.  I read a viewer comment in this forum defending his omission which said (quoting here): `a man who stops the Hobbits being eaten, very slowly, by a tree with his power of song is just quite frankly ludicrous in this day and age'.  That's exactly the point:  LOTR is not about this day and age.By and large, the casting was fine, with the following exceptions:Agent Smith from ""The Matrix"" as Elrond. For God's sake, Weaving even slipped in and out of the ""Agent Smith"" voice.Viggo Mortenson as Aragorn.  He was capable of playing the fighter, but either wasn't capable or given the opportunity to reveal the historian, linguist, lore-learned Aragorn.The interchangeable actors as Merry and Pippin.  Except for their accents, they weren't easy to tell apart.It's easy to say that even at three hours, the film was too short to cover all the ground in the book (and I will certainly not argue this -- I estimate a faithful, yet watchable treatment at about 24 hours -- but Ken Burns' ""Baseball"" was almost that long, wasn't it?), but far too much of that precious time was spent in the action and fight scenes.  The Chamber of Mazarbul scene (the fight with the troll) was one of the better action scenes, and handled very skillfully, but I would have traded most of it for a better treatment of the Council of Elrond (like, why the heck is Boromir there?  Who is Gimli, and why is he at Rivendell? Why wasn't Bilbo there? His offer to take the Ring was most revealing in the book).  And, of course, the whole prologue should have been moved into Frodo's sitting room, where Professor Tolkien wisely put it.It comes down to this.  They didn't trust the book.  The darned thing sold fifty MILLION copies.  That's a BILLION dollars worth of books.  And has a legion of admirers dwarfing Harry Potter's.  But they didn't trust it.One of the things I truly admired about the late Robert Shaw (I sing in the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra Chorus) was that he never tried to put his own `stamp' on a piece of music.  His purpose was always to get at the heart of the music, to serve the composer and the composer's intentions.In a way, a film treatment of a book is a `performance' of that book.  And the better the book, the more beloved by the reading public, the more incumbent it is upon the performer to strive for the heart and soul of the book.  Peter Jackson got much that was superficially right, but missed the life at the center.  The film is cold, frightening, and utterly unlike The Lord of the Rings.Finally, the most disappointing thing:  because any Lord of the Rings film would have to be a production of epic scale, this version may have to stand as the only real attempt at a  film adaptation for many years, perhaps forever.  There have been dozens of ""Hamlet's, and even a bunch of ""Tarzan""s.  And that's one thing that kept running through my mind:  ""This is IT.  This is the treatment that LOTR will get in the cinema. Damn."""
TheLittleSongbird,"Oct 19, 2010",9/10,"J.R.R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad.However, I cannot deny that this is a great film. One of the many strong assets of this picture are the visuals. The cinematography is marvellous, the costumes are splendid, the effects are great, the makeup is immaculate and the scenery is fantastic especially with Rivendell which was like a Utopia. There is also the score, what an amazing score. As much as I do like Howard Shore, his scoring for the Lord of The Rings trilogy is his most memorable for me and probably his most complex as well. There are so many beautiful and haunting parts here, sometimes even at the same time, as well as the charming Hobbits theme, the ethereal theme played while at Rivendell and the sinister bombastic sounds while at Mordor.Now I am not going to say that Peter Jackson is a bad director or an outstanding director, but he has directed some wonderful films especially Heavenly Creatures, and this is no exception, where he does a very capable job directing. The story still has its epic scope, with standouts being the confrontation between Gandalf and Sarouman, the scene in the mines with Balrok and Boromir's death scene. I also liked the pursuit of Frodo and Arwyn and Frodo with the Black Riders which was beautifully shot. Then there is the dialogue, which on the whole is excellent, Gandalf in my personal opinion gets the best of it.And the acting is very good. I do think Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, but Elijah Wood does do a likable enough job here, while Sean Astin's bumbling yet well meaning persona suits Sam well. Cate Blanchett is a lovely Galadriel, and Liv Tyler is stunning as Arwyn. And then there is Christopher Lee, whose presence always ensures that the performance is going to be good, and indeed it was, and Ian Holm is very good as Bilbo. Sean Bean also does well with Boromir, and John Rhys Davies is a welcome presence. Aragorn like Frodo is developed more in the sequels than here, here he is more brooding and charismatic above all else. Not a bad thing really, as Viggo Mortenssen does do that very well. The standout though is Ian McKellen, who is an absolute revelation as Gandalf, the delivery to the camera, the delivery of the lines, perfectly judged. In fact the only real weak link in the cast is Orlando Bloom, yes he is dashing and handsome, but in the process he does come across as a little uncharismatic and bland.In conclusion, a great start. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 25, 2009",10/10,"I have never read a single word of anything by Tolkien. This is not my genre; I have always disliked fantasy, and largely, adventure, as well. Prior to my viewing of this, I didn't care for Jackson, although The Frighteners had its moments. I put off watching this until tonight, where it was on TV. In other words, I cannot judge this as an adaptation, nor can I comment on the Extended Edition. What I can say is that this gripped me from the first frame and did not let go until the last one. That ought to give you an idea of how well-crafted and brilliantly executed a cinematic achievement it is. The plot is compelling and well-told. In spite of a large group of characters, this keeps track of, and develops, them all quite nicely. The acting is spot-on. I did find the comic relief to be annoying, but there's immensely little of it if you look at the overall running time, that aspect of it wasn't made for me(I can imagine kids enjoy it, and it's harmless and inoffensive), and it's easy enough to look past. This looks gorgeous all the way, and the effects are astonishing. The design of beings, locations and items is all creative and well-done. Cinematography and editing are excellent. This is very exciting, and the action is cool and has the impact it is meant to. The score helps the epic scope, and the foreign, non-human language-use makes the world we are seeing feel more strange and distant. There is nothing really offensive in this, though children might find the battle sequences too intense. I recommend this to everyone who can see themselves getting into this. 10/10"
anpwxcat,"Apr 13, 2002",10/10,"Growing up, my dad would always tell me his favorite books were The Lord of the Rings volumes.  But I was never interested in fantasies, so I didn't really care.  Then I found out that Peter Jackman was making the movies so I told my dad.  He became really excited.  But still, I didn't care.  Until one night in November, when they showed the LOTR special on TV.  I was able to catch only the first ten, fifteen minutes and instantly, I wanted to see the movie.  I had never read the books.  My dad took me and my family to see the movie.  I was a bit excited and curious to see how they would do it. Mind you, I knew next to nothing about this story.I sat through the entire three hours in Middle Earth and fell in love with it. Through parts, I would clutch on my brother's arm, tense and hoping that everyone will make it through a lot of the sticky situations they were in. I fell in love with Legolas and his graceful Elf self.  The minute the movie began, I was drawn in.  The special effects were terrific.  I felt like I was there.  I wanted (and still do) to live in Rivendell among the Elves. The backdrops for the movies was fantastic.  Sir Ian McKellan's quote about how New Zealand is Middle Earth is so true.I was very impressed with the casting.  I'm a huge movie buff so I have seen plenty of movies and I won't be lying when I say that LOTR has the best casting ever.  Every person, the mains and the extras, WAS the character they played.  The make-up was incredible.  The orcs creeped me out.  The Elves entranced me.  The Hobbits brought a smile to my face.  Elrond, Hugo Weaving, is the perfect Elf King, firm and commanding, yet with love for his people and respect for Frodo.  I could go on and on, but I won't.I loved the fact how PJ was able to make the Hobbits look small in every single scene.  I would LOVE to know HOW in the world they did that.  I love how the Elves are so graceful and look ethereal.I know that the movie is three hours long and people balk at that.  I took a friend of mine who hasn't seen the movie because it was three hours long. He loved it.  He was engrossed and he had never read the book either. This movie is one of the, if not THE, finest piece of work I have seen.  I eagerly await ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"".  I definitely recommend this movie for everyone to see at least once.  I have seen it four times and will see it yet again soon.  I can never get bored of this movie. Go.  See it.I leave you with a quote from Gandalf: ""All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given"""
Kysugo,"Feb 13, 2024",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy are some of the best Fantasy movies ever made, if not the best. An epic cinematic masterpiece that anyone can enjoy. The storytelling is masterful and captivating. The cinematography is shot with a keen eye for detail with wonderful framing. It's a movie that's visually stunning and beautiful to look at. The filming locations are pristine. The CGI and special effects are incredible for it's time, even today they still hold up. The set designs, costumes and props are immaculate. The world-building and lore is excellent. Everything was intricately and meticulously thought out and nothing goes to waste. You can't help but become engrossed, enraptured and absorbed with the world and the whole experience. The ideas/concepts are amazing, they feel fresh and original. The execution of the whole movie is flawless. It's crazy how the extended edition is almost 4 hours long and yet it only feels like 2 hours. A testament to how tightly written and immaculately told the story is. The ring is a symbol of power that was made from evil energy. It's really interesting to see how it tests people's willpower to see if they can overcome it's influence. Overall, amazing film and a must-watch. It's definitely one of those 100 films to watch before you die."
soccer1818,"May 6, 2002",10/10,"I personally love The Fellowship of the Ring.  I think that it is a fabulous movie and a wonderful adaptation of Tolkien's masterpiece.  For all of you that were bored by LOTR or thought that the movie was too slow, you missed half the movie.  The story is not just about the journey from the Shire to Mordor.  The characters, their relationships, the battle of good vs. evil - these things are the heart of the work and fill those supposedly ""slow"" times.  If you read LOTR before you saw the movie then you understood all of these things.  If not, then you have missed out.  The relationship between Frodo and Sam, Aragorn and the whole fellowship, Legolas and Gimli - they are part of why I love the book and movie.  The strength of their friendships are more powerful than anything else in the novel/movie.Do JRR Tolkien and Peter Jackson justice (and yourself a favor), read The Fellowship of the Ring and The Two Towers before you see Two Towers in December.  PJ made the movie for those of us who love LOTR not for those who love movies.   If you read Two Towers before you see the movie, not only will you understand the story better b/c there are going to be a lot of new characters, but you will appreciate the movie more.  You will love the characters and better appreciate their individual struggles if you read the book first.I have one more thing to say, I love every single one of the actors and actresses in Fellowship of the Ring.  They seem to step perfectly into the characters that Tolkien created.  Hats off to Peter Jackson, Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Sean Astin, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, all the other actors/actresses, and to all those who worked behind the scenes to make Tolkien's books come alive for us."
RorriNator,"May 28, 2023",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is not just a film; it is an extraordinary cinematic journey that immerses viewers in a world of magic, heroism, and boundless imagination. The extended version of this epic fantasy masterpiece only further solidifies its position as one of the greatest trilogies in the history of cinema.The extended edition takes the already magnificent storytelling of director Peter Jackson and expands it, breathing new life into an already captivating tale. Clocking in at over three hours, it allows for a deeper exploration of J. R. R. Tolkien's rich and intricate universe, delving into characters and storylines that were previously left to the imagination.From the breathtaking landscapes of Middle-earth to the intricate details of costumes and set designs, every aspect of this film is crafted with meticulous attention to detail. The extended edition provides even more time to appreciate the remarkable artistry and visual splendor that make Middle-earth come alive on screen.What truly sets ""The Fellowship of the Ring"" apart is its ability to balance grand spectacle with intimate storytelling. It seamlessly weaves together themes of friendship, sacrifice, and the struggle between good and evil. Each character is beautifully portrayed, with performances that resonate deeply with the audience.The extended edition enhances these character arcs by offering additional scenes and moments that provide further depth and understanding. The camaraderie and bonds formed within the Fellowship are given more time to develop, making their journey all the more emotionally resonant.Howard Shore's masterful score is another pillar of the film's greatness. It evokes a range of emotions, from triumph and awe to heart-wrenching sorrow. The extended edition allows for an even fuller immersion into the power of the score, heightening the film's impact and leaving an indelible mark on the viewer.""The Fellowship of the Ring"" serves as the perfect introduction to the larger narrative of the trilogy. It captures the essence of Tolkien's work and sets the stage for the epic battles and complex character arcs that await in the subsequent films.In conclusion, the extended version of ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is a triumph in every sense of the word. Its ability to transport viewers to a world of wonder, its masterful storytelling, and its commitment to detail all contribute to its status as part of the greatest trilogy in the history of cinema. Whether you are a fan of fantasy or simply appreciate exceptional filmmaking, this extended edition is an absolute must-watch that will leave you spellbound."
laxery,"Apr 24, 2025",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings is a true masterpiece of cinema. The unique world created by Tolkien and embodied on the screen by Peter Jackson and the team, cannot be ignored. Everything in this film is great, from the little things to the plot. Visual effects, music, costume design, camera work, sound work, director's work, this is all about the Trilogy as a whole. The film deserves to be the best in history, not only within its genre. The filming of the Fellowship of the Ring and the next two parts can rightfully be called the most large-scale in cinema + revolutionary special effects and music by Howard Shore make this film the best ever created. This is a unique case when an unknown director shoots a film of such a scale and such high quality. An incomparable masterpiece that nothing else can beat. No Interstellar and Godfather are even close to The Lord of the Rings. What other movie can be so intriguing? When I first watched it, I couldn't predict how the movie would end: how will the four Hobbits destroy the ring and defeat the orcs? The Return of the King has won 11 Oscars, all of which are well deserved. That's what a great ending to a great story means, a great ending that began with the best movie of all time, The Fellowship of the Ring."
countryway_48864,"Mar 5, 2002",10/10,"I have loved The Lord of the Rings and The Hobbit and all the writing of Tolkien since the publication of The Lord of the Rings in the '50, when I was in college.  Every one in the dorm was reading it and once I got started I could not stop.Since then, I have read The Hobbit and The Lord of the Rings to my children many time.  Now my oldest son has continued the tradition, reading to his children.When I learned that an attempt was going to be made to use actors and recreate Middle Earth without the use of cartoons, I was both thrilled and nervous.  Could Peter Jackson and his talented group of actors, writers and other creative people REALLY bring this superb story to the screen?I am happy to say, they HAVE!  Every character looks, sounds and acts exactly as I have pictured them all these years.  The ensemble acting is beyond praise.  These actors ARE Gandalf, Strider, Frodo, Sam, Legolas, Merry, Pippen, Galadriel and Arwen et al.I urge all to see this wonderful film!  I can't WAIT for The Two Towers!!"

ovvldc,"Dec 17, 2001",6/10,"I saw this film on sunday morning in a pre-screening organised for regular customers of a big department store. Don't ask me why, my mother has a card for the place and we got tickets.The film was directed by New Zealand director, Peter Jackson, who previously made Braindead, Bad Taste and Heavenly Creatures.The first impression of the film is that Jackson did a good job visually, but in his enthousiasm and personal interpretation screwed up the story. Anyone who has not read the book will probably be overwhelmed by this fantasy film and the amazing special effects in it. To one who knows the book, the film will be a missed opportunity to bring the story and especially the character development in Tolkien's work to the big screen.I will elaborate somewhat on all of these points. Visually, the film is overwhelming. From the cute homeliness of the Shire to the architecturals of Lothlorien to the tower of Orthanc in Isengard. From the hobbit 'look' to the Uruk-Hai, from Sauron's burning lidless eye to Galadriel's temptation, it looks stunning and the computer generated effects merge with the acting like few films have done before.The problem is mainly that the visual stuff receives too much attention. Jackson's roots in horror (even 'funny horror') are pretty obvious in this film. This is most evident in Bilbo's flash of rage when he cannot have the ring back in Rivendell. Very textbook horror film stuff. In the book, the mountain troll in the chamber of Mazarbul receives a wound in the foot and makes his exit after two lines. In the film, the Company fights it for five long minutes. The Watcher at the Hollin Gate does not come out of the water in the book. Silliest of all, the Balrog of Moria is a typical huge horned demon in the film and its arrival is announced in a very pompous fashion.The leads to the film's main flaws. First of all are the plot changes. Some of these are done in the interest of film length, such as cutting out the Old Forest and Tom Bombadil and most of the chase through the shire. The expanded role of Arwen is politically correcting but not of great consequence. Other things seriously screw up the story:In the film, Saruman is enslaved by Sauron and the whole process of the transformation of Isengard to a mimic of the Dark Tower and the creation of the Uruk Hai is broadly displayed. In the book, Saruman is out for power of his own and just mentioning that Saruman mixed the vile race of orcs with those of man is evidence enough that he is up to no good. Nor is there a telekinetic battle in the book in which Saruman captures Gandalf. Jackson appears to want one single evil in charge and does not use the corrupting temptations of power by itself. Herein a human dimension of the book is lost.Reversely, in the film Isildur is tempted by the promise of power when he takes the ring, thereby causing the Numenoreans to fall from grace. In the book, the ring is much more subtle and Isildur keeps it as a token for his fallen brother and father. In the film this results in Boromir blatantly coveting the ring even at the council of Elrond and portraying him like a fool when he does not know Aragorn. Worst of all, Aragorn is changed into part fighting machine (fighting off the five Nazgul at Weathertop singlehandedly) and part angelic Messiah (not being tempted by the ring and sending Frodo off to Mordor alone with a sorrowful smile).The third case is that in the film Saruman and Gandalf know of the Balrog of Moria, which is not in the book, nor does Gimli in the book invite them to Uncle Balin's mines. In the book, Gimli came to Rivendell to get word of Balin's mission to recapture Moria. The final thing to mention here is that in the film, the interplay between Gimli and Galadriel is entirely discarded, while in the book this contributes greatly to the friendship between Gimli and Legolas. All in all it makes the group hug at the end when they set after Pippin and Merry come out of thin air.The end result, to which other factors contribute is that many of the subtleties in the book are utterly lost. The One Ring actively talks to everyone and gets on people much more blatantly than in the book. Galadriel is portrayed like the Elven witch that rumour in the outside world would have her be. The Elves and Dwarves bicker openly at the first opportunity, rather than mistrusting each other because they are unfamiliar with each other.The saddest thing is that most of this could have been fixed easily. Galadriel could have had three more sentences at the Mirror, and all would be explained and within the storyline of the book. At least some attention could have been paid to the motivations of the characters, particularly for Frodo, Sam and Aragorn, but for all of the Fellowship to some degree. Kindness, doubt and grief at the many losses are a major part of the book but the film has just made no time for it.Instead, Jackson chose an action heavy film, thereby degrading a great book of fiction to an ordinary fantasy novel. The focus is on the visual horrors they encounter and the characters are propelled by some inbuilt fate or else by Elrond's mission decree. While I have seen worse, the source material has so much more debt that I cannot but call this film a sorely missed opportunity to bring Tolkien's book to life."
westonclark,"Dec 19, 2001",2/10,"I was taken to a midnight showing of the first Lord of the Rings movie. Like having sex for 3 hours with no orgasm I was completely disappointed. The movie was eye candy to behold.  The scenery and the amazing special affects were stunning.  I have not read the books, and frankly, I don't want to now.  I was so bored.  I almost began to cry.  I felt trapped in a movie which went from one foe to the next...to the next....to the next....to the next.....to the next....to the next.....to the next....and on and on and on, so long that when the main character noted ""I wish the ring had never found me,"" I agreed.  As the movie progressed different foes and challenges popped up as though they just magically appeared--Oh look we are stuck in these frigid mountains, no where to go.......it is OH so cold....what do we do? Oh, I know, lets take these mines here that just conveniently randomly appeared!  If you've read the books, you might enjoy the closeness, as I hear it has.  However, if you haven't...don't bother.  It is TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO long...TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO boring....and TOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO plotless....and all this, for 3 hours and 10 minutes...and then, then THEN!!!  NOTHING!!!!! Wait until you can set aside 9 hours and watch them all at once, then at least it might be slightly rewarding."

taima133,"Feb 14, 2002",10/10,"Reading through some of other peoples opinions its pretty clear that it has had a huge influence on people. Most people love it, a lot of people hate it, and some just don't know what to make of it. I don't think I have ever seen a film with such a huge range of differing opinions. People say it won't stand the test of time? but considering the book was writing 50 years ago LOTR has already stood the test of time. As far as the film is concerned IMHO its one of the best films I have ever seen and in 3 years time when we can sit down and watch all three movies back to back I am sure a lot of people who didn't like the first film for various reasons complaining about the lack of character development and a ending will more than likely change there opinions and will start to look on the LOTR trilogy as a true classic."
ericjg623,"Mar 20, 2002",10/10,"I am not normally much of a fan of the `Sword & Sorcery' genre, but this movie just blew me away. The visuals, the acting, the storytelling, all are simply superb. There's plenty of CGI and special effects, but unlike certain other movies (Terminator 2, for example) they do not dominate the film, but merely enhance the basic plot.  This is without doubt one of the best movies I've ever seen, and certainly the best of the past year. If this doesn't dominate the Oscars, then Hollywood is in a state of serious denial. Films like this is what movies are supposed to be all about.10+ out of 10"
williambendavis-933-218958,"Dec 25, 2014",10/10,"I have to say Peter Jackson did a freaking amazing job at translating this into film. He got everything down to a tee. The sweeping cinematography captures the enormousness of Middle Earth as well as provides for some beautiful eye candy. The combination of practical and special effects allow for some extraordinarily detailed scenes that really bring Tolkien's world to life. The casting is absolutely perfect. Elijah Wood as Frodo, Ian Mckellan as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom as Legolas?, Liv Tyler as Arwen, Sean Bean as Boromir, Cate Blanchett as Galadriel, Hugo Weaving as Elrond, and Christopher Lee as Saruman? You simply cannot do better than that, and I applaud whoever did the casting. All these things come together to form a masterpiece of a film that is the start to one of the best trilogies of all time."
KGersen,"Apr 17, 2002",10/10,"First things first - I've read LOTR probably 3/4 times. & the Silmarillion and bits of the Unfinished Tales and yadda yadda yadda....I however have grown up enough to know that LOTR (the book) is for many a great novel because it relates to when they first read it...it is great within it's context but not the greatest book ever or any of that tosh...IMHO all lists are bunkum anyway.So having got that off my chest, here is another confession....I was worried, very, very worried about LOTR on the big screen. Would it be a 'Krull', a 'Willow', a 'Beastmaster', a.........urgh,,,Dungeons & Dragons? You know what I mean...fantasy is damn hard to do. The Tolkien imitators that plague the bookshelves prove this as do the whole stackfull of cheesy, hammy fantasy movies with cheesy, hammy names chasing after magical McWidgets to save the nation / planet / galaxy / universe from eternal damnation. I had prepared a crushing hex for Peter Jackson if he inflicted this fate upon LOTR.But there was a sign of hope, like Glamdring's pale fire in the smoke and flames of the Balrog (er, enough of that) - 3 films. Not 1 mish-mashed jampacked farce-fest. No, 3 full-length films giving the book's epic scale a chance to work it's wonder on the filmgoers.Well Peter Jackson pulled it off - by resolutely avoiding the 'big-name' actors, by insisting on New Zealand for filming, by used WETA for effects, by nipping & tucking the story where required (I suspect even Jackson could not have kept Tom Bombadil from looking like total clown), by expanding where needed (another writer is very correct that Arwen's importance is only clear in the book during the Appendix).If you don't like fantasy one little bit...which makes me wonder where exactly your imagination resides....then even with this appalling handicap LOTR 'Fellowship of the Ring' can still enthrall you. If you love the book, the film still does the trick. If you just like being contrary for the sake of it then I guess you won't like this film. But then I doubt you like much else in life either."
motrous,"Apr 14, 2021",10/10,"What Star Wars was for many people, this was for me. I saw it five times in the theater. I still get chills the moment I hear the orchestra pick up and Galadriel say ""One ring to rule them all. One by one, the free peoples of Middle Earth fell to the power of the Ring."" I'm getting chills just thinking about it. A perfect film."
poetellect,"Dec 9, 2001",N/A,"Holy *$#t.  Mind-blowing is a word that comes to mind.  Think the intensity of Requiem for a Dream meets the epic story of Braveheart meets the eye-popping cinematography and visuals of the Terminator movies and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon.  Then sprinkle in a few acting lessons that bring to mind the ablilites of Brando and Olivier and a novel-to-film adaptation that rivals Egoyan's ""The Sweet Hereafter"" and you'll have, maybe, a FRACTION of an idea of what this movie accomplishes- and, having only read the Hobbit, it still manages to astound and mind-boggle myself, who am not a ""hardcore"" LOTR fan.  Best-Picture material."
Sfpsycho415,"Mar 11, 2004",7/10,"While Fellowship of the Ring is a good adventure movie, i also think it is very overrated. It doesn't hold a candle to A New Hope. The first part of the trilogy gets off to a slow start as we meet the characters who will soon become the fellowship. It picks up speed when the faceless, hood-wearing, horsemen come looking for the ring. There are some great action scenes that follow and an exciting cliffhanger at the end. I own this, the Two Towers, and will own Return of the King because they are good movies. But masterpieces they are not. They get slow at times, become cheesy at other times, and the acting is not top of the line. I'd give the whole trilogy a 7 out of 10. No more, no less. 7/10"
rooprect,"Aug 21, 2005",2/10,"In all fairness, it's a good kids movie. But I'm afraid that all the hype & numerous awards will fool some people into believing it has artistic merit. Once again, let me stress: IT'S A KIDS MOVIE.You'll find no subtlety, no symbolism, no real character development, no underlying theme, no clever dialog, and nothing really to challenge your mind. Instead you'll get action, dazzling landscapes, special effects, a rushing musical score, good costumes, good makeup and action (I say that twice, because it's the best thing the movie has going for it... really, the action scenes are pretty good).But if you're looking for an *artistic* fairy tale (like City of Lost Children, Brazil, Big Fish, The Crow, Nosferatu [1979] or Arizona Dream), you'll not only be disappointed... you'll be downright annoyed."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 21, 2024",10/10,"From the moment the screen flickers to life, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring unfolds like a grand tapestry, intricately woven with legend, adventure, and the epic struggle between light and darkness. Peter Jackson's masterful adaptation of J. R. Tolkien's beloved novel is not simply a film; it is a monumental achievement in storytelling that transcends the genre of fantasy and truly captures the essence of human resilience and friendship.At the heart of this cinematic masterpiece is the journey of an unassuming hobbit named Frodo Baggins, played with poignant nuance by Elijah Wood. The sheer audacity of entrusting the fate of Middle-earth to such a humble figure creates a powerful narrative dichotomy that resonates deeply with audiences. As Frodo embarks on his perilous quest to destroy the One Ring, we are invited to accompany him and a fellowship that includes the brave Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen), the wise wizard Gandalf (Ian McKellen), and the fiercely loyal Sam (Sean Astin), among others. Each character is beautifully fleshed out, their distinct traits and backstories enriching the quest and imprinting them into our hearts.The film is a breathtaking marvel, with the sweeping landscapes of New Zealand serving as an awe-inspiring backdrop for the iconic realms of Middle-earth. The cinematography captures the breathtaking beauty of the Shire, the ominous shadows of Moria, and the ethereal majesty of Rivendell, making every frame feel like a painting come to life. Howard Shore's hauntingly beautiful score acts as a symphonic guide through this grand adventure, imbuing each moment with a sense of urgency and wonder.What truly elevates The Fellowship of the Ring beyond mere spectacle is its profound exploration of themes such as friendship, sacrifice, and the eternal struggle against evil. The camaraderie formed among the members of the fellowship mirrors the strength of unity in the face of insurmountable odds, reminding us of the power that lies within bonds forged through shared peril. This film teaches that even the smallest person can change the course of the future, a message that resounds powerfully throughout generations.The craftsmanship in this film is remarkable-from the stunning practical effects to the meticulous costume and set design, every element has been carefully considered to ensure authenticity. The dialogue is rich and brimming with the gravitas of a world steeped in history, and the inclusion of Tolkien's own words grounds the narrative in a sense of belonging to an ancient lore.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is a timeless classic that stands as a testament to the enduring power of storytelling. It enchants, inspires, and invites us to dream about the possibilities that lie beyond our own backyards. As the credits roll, we are left not only with the echoes of an epic adventure but the unforgettable truth that in a world shadowed by darkness, hope, friendship, and courage can light the way through the darkest of times. This is more than a film-it is an invitation to embark on a journey that will forever resonate in the hearts and minds of all who dare to step into Middle-earth."
yavidarabia,"Jul 31, 2022",10/10,"Without sounding pompous, Fellowship (cinematically) is the best of the three films. Many right-brain fans will deem the latter two as they involve more 'action' so to speak, but unfortunately deter from the lore of Tolkien's' masterpiece.Not only do I believe this is the best of the three, I believe Fellowship is one of the best films ever produced. It fulfills in my mind what a '10' movie merits: Perfect Cast, beautiful Cinematography , amazing Dialogue, Remarkable Soundtrack, and overall excellent direction from Peter Jackson where he paces the film perfectly, taking time with introductions but never boring the viewer.Gandalfs scene with the aesthetically CGI Balrog (which still holds up) stands alone as the best scene of the entire Trilogy--Ian McKellon's performance truly shines. Enjoy Frodo at his best before we are dealt with a not so heroic and quite annoying counterpart dealt to us in the sequels.To all fans: many older fans (50+) agree this is the best of the Trilogy. AFI selected Fellowship (and only Fellowship) in their 100 Years...100 Movies and in a half-hearted appeal to cast authority, Elijah Wood believes this is the best. ""Best"" was the focus of this review, not to dampen the brilliance of the latter two, but rather highlight the beauty this film holds.I have the Trilogy from best to not so best: 1, 3, 2 with scores 10, 9, and 8 respectively.-J."
lambiepie-2,"Nov 28, 2002",10/10,"How I wish I could have seen THIS film first. I had no interest whatsoever in The Lord of the Rings books. Let's be honest, when its required reading in literature class and the teacher made middle earth seem as dry as a chip, who would have an interest?Well, this film made me have an interest and want to go back and read the books again. This production was lavishly and handsomely done. I was excited, thrilled, scared at points, cheering, laughing and just caught up in the wonder of this production. There isn't ONE character I didn't like, there wasn't ONE moment I wasn't interested. There is so much I can explain about the film, but for my review, I just want to comment on how it effected me as an ex-student assigned to read a book I though was horrid, and seeing it decades later as a wonderful adaptation that I watched over 100 times by now.Here's another film I did NOT go to the movie house to see and yes, I am kicking my own butt for not doing so. I missed a great film on wide screen, and just to let everyone know, I am in line for ""The Two Towers"" already.Granted, this will not help my ""C"" grade I got when I was assigned to read it back in the day, but I love his film to death. I just bought the expanded DVD, and now I am a Lord of the Rings fan for life!Future LOTR literature teachers, take note! Then make sure your students get to see the film as a companion piece to the books...believe you me, they'll thank you later with plenty of interest."
Primalase,"Apr 22, 2002",10/10,"Unlike Star Wars I: Phantom Menace, this movie definitely lived up to all its pre-release hype.  Peter Jackson should have won the Best Director ""Oscar"" for one reason alone:  he DIDN'T screw up the movie, and he DID remain true to the original story."
"David, Film Freak","Jan 11, 2002",10/10,"Well what can I say? Without sounding like a broken record, this is, quite frankly, a masterpiece.The first of three films about a young Hobbit's quest to return an evil ring, titled 'The Fellowship of the Ring', this picture is brilliant in every sense of the word.The lush New Zealand scenery portrays a bold and beautiful Middle Earth, while the superb casting of the main cast (including Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood and Liv Tyler) are perfectly picked for their intriguing and detailed characters.I cannot praise this movie enough. Everything about it - the special FX, the score, the scenery, the plot, the cast - is all fantastic, and for the 3 hours the film runs, it manages to grab you and take you on a spellbinding journey into the imaginary world in which they inhabit... something 'Harry Potter' could never do. 11/10."
SteveB Ohio,"Jul 9, 2002",10/10,"Reading the other reviews here, it seems that people either loved this movie or they hated it.  It also seems that those who say they hated it don't give any concrete reasons other than they don't seem to ""get the point.""  The same is true of the books that this series is based on: some people think them to be the best works of fiction of all time, while others think they are nonsense.  Well, you can count me firmly in the ""loved it"" camp!Ever since I first read these books in the '70s I have hoped that someone would make them into movies. (My other hope is that someone would take on the project of making quality film versions of Isaac Asimov's ""Foundation Trilogy,"" but that's a different story!)  The animated version was mediocre at best, but this one is breathtaking!  Never mind the minor differences between the film and the books, this has got to be the best adaptation of book to cinema that I have ever seen.  I would dare say that it is even the best film of any type that I have seen.Why?  If you are one of those who ""don't get it,"" I can't offer anything to convince you.  Let's just say that this movie brings to life the incredible world that J.R.R. Tolkein created in a way that transcends simple fantasy. The characters and places are believable as real rather than mere creations of a fairy tale world. The story has more substance than the comic book style of the Star Wars series.   The action is gripping.  The visual effects are stunning.  There is genuine emotion, from joy to despair.  The acting is flawless.   And through the entire experience, there is the constant theme of pure good versus pure evil; and staying true to one's friends and commitments regardless of how bad things get.  And it does it without being preachy about it:  it is totally free of the absurd political correctness that infects so many other films.This movie hits on all cylinders.  The first time I saw it, I was in a theater that was completely packed.  Nobody got up during its three hour length.  There was no whispering or other signs of inattention.  When it was over and the lights came on, there was a continued hush that was almost reverent.  When people started to get up, I heard comments like ""It's going to be a long year.""  (Meaning, of course, it will be a long wait until the second installment is released this December.)The only flaw I can find is that it was too fast-paced in some places, resulting in some parts of the story being a blur for those who aren't already familiar with the books.  Even so, the three hours go by very quickly and leave you wanting to see more of the story.  That will have to wait until the end of this year!For those who haven't yet seen it, I would strongly recommend reading the books (or at least read The Fellowship of the Ring) and then rent or buy the dvd when it is released this August."

TxMike,"Aug 10, 2002",N/A,"I went to school in the 1950s and 1960s. I never read ""The Hobbit"" nor any of the ""Ring"" trilogies. So I only had a vague idea what Tolkien and his writings were all about, although I already knew there were ""Ring"" fanatics of all ages out there. I got a ""free"" DVD as a result of the Blockbuster campaign where you buy a 10-week rental card for $25 and get a DVD in return at no extra cost. A deal I couldn't refuse!Well, last night I watched the film, along with good friends Frank and Judy who happen to be ""Ringheads."" The filming was absolutely gorgeous. The DVD transfer is about the best I have seen so far, and the Dolby 5.1 sound is very dynamic and beautiful. In short about all one could ask for in a DVD. Plus, there is a second disk which has over two hours of ""extras"", several ""making of"" plus a 10-minute preview of the second installment due out later this year.While the movie itself is very interesting, especially the first one-third which sets the stage for the journey that ""the fellowship of the ring"" will undertake, to ultimately return the ""one ring"" to the volcano, NEVER did I feel that this was a ""great"" film. As the story unfolds there are increasingly brutal battles to be fought, one after another, with little story between each battle. While that may make for really good reading, where you can create exactly the images you want in your own mind, as a film it gets to be a bit much. I actually became bored, with yet another battle and narrow escape. Like adding too much spice to a good meal.As a film of a historic work of fiction, and especially this DVD release, it is almost perfect.  However, as a fictional work the story is a bit of a let-down, in my opinion. It is best appreciated by all the ""Ringheads"" out there who have bonded over the years with the ring trilogy and Tolkien. For my own enjoyment there are more interesting fictional works. Maybe I'll have a different opinion in two years, after I've seen all three of the installments."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 23, 2023",7/10,"I found the book more interesting than the film. The essence of the book, in my opinion, is not the fierce warriors or the battle scenes, but the buildup of the characters of the most helpless of all the participants in this drama, the Hobbit. Although having great music and cinematography, the film lacks soul. It is visually stunning, and the actors do a great job with the roles they are given, but the real problem is that many adults will just not believe the content. That is why the Hobbit is so important to both the novel and the film; it provides soul to an otherwise souless existence.Part of the problem may have been that the producers decided to take the easy way out and create a film for the senses rather than the mind or the soul. And this works well, once again, with younger audiences. Adults want more than just bells and whistles."
MichaelORourke,"Jan 12, 2005",1/10,"I am assuredly in the minority when I state Jackson's Lord of the Rings Trilogy is some of the worst film making I have ever seen. It would appear that he and his production team read the books, sort of, maybe 30 years ago; bought the Cliff notes, and from that wrote the screenplay. To illustrate my POV, I recommend listening to the superlative 13 hour radio adaptation produced by the BBC, recorded I believe in 1981.Jackson and crew erred when they depended too much on computer fx, and spent too much time on the spectacle of combat and war. I often thought I was watching a slasher movie. What makes the original Trilogy compelling are the relationships and the subtext characters carry with them from beginning to end. To be sure there are mythic battles, both large and small. But they come out of very carefully crafted relationships and a deep well of subtext.I don't quarrel with the New Zealand locations, I do quarrel with the dumpy looking sets that were haphazardly glossed over with computer grafx fixes. I don't quarrel with the casting except Frodo, and yet I found the direction so superficial, and often perplexing, if not simply muddled (Galadriel as an English Vamp?!).A clue to my dissatisfaction can be found in the omission of Tom Bombadil, the only character in the original not affected by the Ring. His eccentric wisdom and unexplained powers ground the plot because there is something, someone who is outside the Dark Lord's power. There is in the Tolkien universe a power unimaginable which Sauron cannot touch. And that is essential to the fabric which holds Middle Earth together. Which Tolkien in his craft and his wisdom knew he had to give expression to. And Jackson in his foolhardiness ignored.Why didn't Jackson's team follow the books with more trust? The master had already worked it out perfectly. Well, almost. The Trilogy wasn't long enough, which Tolkien realized after its completion. Nevertheless, the project would have been immensely improved had Jackson and his team laid out a six episode franchise to match the six books of the Trilogy, taken more time to film it in their excellent locations of choice, and above all, truly paid homage to its original creator by following his work faithfully.These films are a mish-mash which titillated the masses for a brief time. And that is tragic, because it will be long, long before someone will be able to do them justice."
numenorsniper-66396,"Feb 4, 2022",10/10,"No other film trilogy is as strong, not by measure of their individual parts nor as the complete saga, and I doubt that there will ever be any trilogy to take the crown from LOTR.I saw all three multiple times in the cinema upon their release, and countless times at home since, including a few 15 hour marathons of their extended versions which once viewed are forever indispensable by comparison to their theatrical versions. The commentary tracks and behind-the-scenes footage on the extended versions are just brilliant.LOTR has been a core part of my life for over 20 years, as of the writing of this review. I've been obsessed with the films, books, games, music, and everything about it really. Alongside the Halo saga and all that includes such as its music, LOTR is the best, and both started in the same year.I just now hope that the upcoming LOTR tv series doesn't screw it up too badly."
Doddi,"Feb 16, 2002",10/10,"I am one of few who openly admits his favourite movies are Edward Scissorhands and Titanic, but before seeing Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring (abbr. FOTR) I knew I was going to see something unique.But nothing prepared me for this: jawdropping sets and special effects, details that are almost on the verge of sanity (!) and brilliant costumes and make-up. To have such a blend with amazing cast and director... is a delight. Peter Jackson has performed a miracle. He's taken the most popular novel of 20th century, defied the pessimists, stood tall in his shorts and turned it into the greatest movie I've ever seen. I tell you, everything in the film was ""perfect"". Nothing less.The script must have been difficult to write but it has been done so well here. Peter Jackson has also managed to get a cast that is known but not really ""super-star"", and they are perfectly cast in their roles. Fate brought Viggo Mortensen into the role of Aragorn (I can't see how Stuart Townsend was chosen) and I've never seen an actor live into the character so much. Ian McKellen IS Gandalf, so no contest and hand him the Oscar, thank you. The hobbits are wonderful and especially well portrayed, led by Elijah Wood, the story's small hero. Liv Tyler and Cate Blanchett are heavenly and Tyler even surprised me with good accent and acting. So did Hugo Weaving, Ian Holm, Christopher Lee and that newcomer Orlando Bloom.Added to this is the mythic and wonderful music from Howard Shore. I love it and it brings me everytime to the emotional highs and lows of the film and I see the sorrow, the faces and my heart cries out. It's a powerful film, with marvellous acting and music and sets..., directed flawlessly by soon-to-become-my-favourite-director Peter Jackson. At the end I can only say that I thank each and everyone involved with this movie because I felt better as a person after seeing it, and I'm always thankful for a perfect time. FOTR is indeed perfect!"
Khwaj,"Mar 19, 2002",10/10,"I don't care what many might think about this, Lord of the Rings rocked me to the ""Beyond"" and back.Powerful visions of the past, epic battles since films like Braveheart, Gladiator and Brotherhood of the Wolf. It packed plenty of punches than a dozen Mike Tyson's put together.Although I hadn't read the books it didn't dissuade me in any way whatsoever to watch this film.Hats off to actors Sir Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Christopher Lee and of course the lovely Sean Bean and Cate Blanchett.Forget Titanic, this by far is more than just a technical accomplishment or creative input. I really do hope that it sweeps the Academy Awards which it will no doubt do.Birds, beasts, demons this film also very much reminded me of gothic visions of other directors like Dario Argento and the late great Lucio Fulci with there dark brooding imaginations featured in their body of works..  .For example the scene where Gandalf confronts the gigantic demon was without a doubt the single most spectacular scene that really does shake the very grounds of the film's sequence.I know I might sound like a real boot kissing art fag for liking this film a little too much, but on the other hand the visuals are most definately the single biggest advantage besides the acting as well. I know I also that not reading the book I might sound biased too, but then again it's personal opinions that really matter.I just hope that the follow up (Two Towers) also lives up to what Fellowship of the Rings offered us.Instant classic 10/10"
JayWolfgramm,"Sep 1, 2022",10/10,"Let's take a moment and consider what a risk this was for New Line Cinema. It's the late 90's early 2000's and Peter Jackson comes in and wants over 100 million dollars to make a fantasy movie. Peter Jackson, a director whose previous credits include ""The Frighteners"" and ""Bad Taste"". Fantasy films were seen at the time as box office poison. Lord of the Rings was seen as a book that could not be adapted. It had a loyal fanbase, but the film adaptations had already tried and failed to bring in a return. And Jackson was wanting to film 3 movies altogether at once. This pitch must have sounded crazy. Thankfully for all involved they gave the greenlight and we got this wonderful film.This is the go to fil as an example of grand fantasy epic. The cinematography and effects are breathtaking, letting the audience grasp the huge scope of the adventure. The music by Howard Shore is pitch perfect, conveying triumph, mystery, sorrow and any emotion needed for the time. Although magical and mysterious, the film seamlessly explains the stakes and story to the audience. The action scenes are all well shot and the quest always feels like it is going forward.Along with the technical aspects of music and editing, what really holds this film together are the characters. All 9 members of the fellowship are casted and acted perfectly. All the characters the fellowship come across do a fantastic job. Christopher Lee as Saruman, that is the role this man was born to play. They bring these literary characters to life in such a way that I can't picture anyone else in the role.Compared to the other two films in the epic trilogy, this one is the most focused. As the films go on, the storyline will get split into the different side quests of the groups. But in this first one, save for cutting to Saruman, the story focuses primarily on the adventure of our fellowship. This is also the only one of the trilogy that has Enya do the end credits song, clearly all the other movies could have benefited from doing the same.I'm not sure what more I can add to the conversation that hasn't been said before. There is no other movie with such a long runtime that I have watched as often as Lord of the Rings. Prepare yourself for the adventure of a lifetime, the one fantasy film to rule them all."
LorDom,"Feb 23, 2003",10/10,"Before this movie was made, I had barely even heard of the Lord of the Rings trilogy. When the movie came out, it got such rave reviews and looked so interesting that I was quite eager to see it. When I finally did see it, I was SO impressed. The story is absolutely enthralling, the special affects were amazing, and the acting was superb. This movie really got me more interested in all the actors playing the hobbits, and also Ian McKellen, actually to be honest, I REALLY enjoyed all the actors, especially, Viggo Mortensen(playing Aragorn). There is not one element, one scene in this movie, (in my opinion) that could use any improvement. I would strongly recommend this movie to any who enjoys the fantasy\science fiction, even if you have not read the books. This is the best movie I have ever seen, and I can't wait to see the rest of the trilogy."
moviesleuth2,"Jul 28, 2008",10/10,"Personally, I'm not a big fan of fantasy. I find it rather pretentious and for most entries into the genre, silly and/or melodramatic. But Peter Jackson's ""Lord of the Rings"" is an exception. It's a grand adventure filled with limitless energy and likable characters. The series is at the top of the IMDb ""Top 250"" list, and rightly so. The first installment is extraordinary.I'm going to skip over the plot because by now everyone knows it. The acting is pitch-perfect across the board. Elijah Wood has clearly grown out of his kid roles, and is terrific as Frodo. His co-star Ian McKellen may have gotten the Oscar nod for his role, but Wood equals him. Likewise, McKellen finds the right note for Gandalf. Everyone else is perfectly suited for their roles as well. Special note goes to Sean Bean, who made a career out of playing creeps and villains, is successful as Boromir, and shows that he has more range than people may give him credit for.The stakes were incredibly high for this film series, and obviously it paid off. Peter Jackson deserves much of the credit. His work here is the fantasy answer to George Lucas' ""Star Wars"" saga. Unlike much of today's CGI, it wasn't done cheaply, and everything looks authentic, and the result is breathtaking. It's hard to tell what's real and what's not. But Jackson's skill goes beyond the effects. Much of the acclaim of Tolkien's series is the fact that he created a whole new world. Jackson does the same thing; it doesn't feel like a bunch of effects were added to sets or everything was in front of a blue screen. Jackson has created a whole new world, just like Tolkien did.Of course, this would not be worth anything if Jackson and his co-writers hadn't written a screen adaptation that was worthy of the book (which I have not read). Everything moves smoothly and nothing feels left out or short-changed.Many films have been destroyed by too much hype. But ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is so grand that nothing could diminish its spectacle. And what a film to deserve it!"
H4wke,"May 11, 2023",N/A,"I've grown up in New Zealand. As a result, Lord of the Rings was tied to our countries identity quite heavily in the 00s. This could be a bad thing, but it helps tremendously that the films were so damn good.I didn't watch this in theatres (I was 5). I first saw this film on VHS at my late grandad's house. Going off memories, I wouldn't expect grandad to have liked the film, yet it was one of the few VHSes he bought.I remember seeing the scale models they used for Barad-Dur in Te Papa, the biggest museum in the country. I've been to Weta Workshop where they made so many advances in CGI. I visited many of the locations shown in the film; I've flown over the misty mountains, I've walked through the woods where they made Rivendell, hell I've even been to the little nook where they hide from the black rider. I've met Sir Richard Taylor as well, head of Weta Workshop, and he was fantastic to (briefly) talk to.I think it's important to bring up how intertwined this trilogy is with my country's identity while growing up, because it truly does bring a sense of pride to think about these films. This was a cinematic achievement. The premiere was in Wellington. There's giant Lord of the Rings and Hobbit models at the airport. Hobbiton is just an hour and a half away from me.The making-of on the blu rays is the best I've ever seen, and it showcases the country really working together to bring Tolkien's vision to life. One example is gathering basically all the horses in New Zealand for Return of the King, and dressing most of the riders in beards to pass them off as men (there weren't enough male riders). I don't expect to see something like this achieved for quite a while, if ever.This is the first viewing after I finally read the book for the first time. Usually reading the book can detract from the film, but here it's made me appreciate it all the more. The changes make so much sense, though I understand some people who read the books first finding them annoying. This is probably because the films are what I know, and love. The books don't have Howard Shore's soundtrack, possibly my favourite of all time. The books don't have Ian McKellen as Gandalf, nor Sean Bean as Boromir. The books don't have the NZ backdrop.Though, of course, none of these films are possible without the books. Lord of the Rings is an exemplary work of foundational fantasy, and is extremely rich in lore and detail. This is the lite version, but it carries the heart and delivers it in a tighter package. I prefer the films. Maybe, on a reread I'll like the book more, but it's got a lot to catch up on.Now the review is already long-winded, so I'll briefly talk about my favourite sequence. It goes without saying that the film is high quality on every front. There's only a few CGI shots that haven't aged well-the practical props and sets still look absolutely incredible.But the best part, is the drums in the deep sequence. It's my favourite part of the book, and here it's brought to life so damn well. Every time I watch it, my heart races. I know what's going to happen, yet my heart races. The council of Elrond is where the film starts to get epic, but Moria really solidifies how layered this world really is. This is a living mythology.This rewatch I watched with one of my cousins, who after having lived in New Zealand for 21 years had never seen the film. This was, quite simply, blasphemy. Especially since he was a fantasy fan. So it was a great experience seeing it anew through his eyes, and securing his NZ citizenship (watching the trilogy is a part of life here).Of course he mentioned 'ohhhhh that's where that's from' many a time. These films have soaked into the cultural zeitgeist and much remains to this day. Oh, and the Bilbo moment got him good.So my rambling is pretty much over. I wrote this rather quickly-I think hastily gushing about it, while unedited, showcases my love for this film more (I swear I'm not lazy). Now I'm not entirely sure if Fellowship is my favourite in the trilogy. As a kid it was Return of the King, so it'll be interesting revisiting that one after reading the book. I understand it has the most changes, some of which are considered to be the worst parts of the adaptation. But for now, I move onto The Two Towers, my least favourite, and still somehow an incredible film."
heisenberg83,"Dec 18, 2009",6/10,"This film is beautiful to watch - like looking at a wonderful photo album of a fantasy world. But it is PAINFULLY slow and dull. I gave it a second watch recently and after about 1.5 hours into it I was playing with my iPHONE instead.The trouble is the protagonists are invincible and you know they're always going to be okay. And even worse, the director throws at them stupid number of baddies which is totally unrealistic, and there's no real sense of danger. The battle scenes are too CGI obviously, and go on too long.Watch the original ""Clash of the Titans"" instead."
alindsayal,"Dec 12, 2021",10/10,"So with the Lockdown back in effect I thought it was time to get started on re watching The Lord Of The Rings and Hobbit Films so yesterday I watched The Fellowship Of The Ring and here is my review for it. The premise of the film sees a group of companions from different races have to come together to travel to a dark land to destroy a powerful ring and stop the dark lord Sauron.Main Character
Elijah Wood plays Frodo Baggins a Hobbit who is tasked with carrying the ring and he is great here. You really get the feeling that Frodo is out of his depth on the quest but Wood does a good job in making him likeable and you really want to see him succeed in his quest. Viggo Mortenson plays Aragorn and he is brilliant here, he is such a physical actor here and he nails all the action scenes that he is given. He is also a really interesting character, I mean you are given bits and pieces in this film to keep you interested, but not giving you too much right off the bat.Supporting Characters
There are so many characters in this film and everybody is great but I will only talk about a few of them in greater detail. Sir Ian McKellen plays Gandalf The Grey and he is awesome here, Gandalf is so wise and McKellen nails it as the wise, fun and action heavy wizard that is a real mentor figure to the rest of The Fellowship and does it effectively. Sean Bean plays Boromir and he is also a really interesting character here, he has a bit of a darker personality then the other characters but he gives a very memorable performance. Sir Christopher Lee plays Saruman The White and of course he is fantastic, he is a legend and a hue Lord Of The Rings fan so of course he is great in the role, Saruman is another really interesting cog of the film and his dynamic with Gandalf is fascinating to watch. As I said everybody is great, Orlando Bloom is great, Cate Blanchett is great, Sean Astin is great and the whole group is just so great and one of the greatest ensembles of all time.Story
The story is great, it brings you into this world as we follow these people come together on this epic quest. The characters and their connection together is what drives the film forward and you will end up caring about all of them throughout, it has a simple good vs evil but layers it with so much depth to make this a great journey. The film may be 3 hours long but the story stays interesting throughout and moves at a really nice pace to keep you intrigued for every minute of the film.Script
The script is great, it takes this fantastical world and gives us interesting and down to earth characters that we can look up to and care about. This is obviously a very dramatic film and it nails all of that but it is the humour too that makes this script legendary. You can go from drama to humour and it feels really natural and helps build the world and the characters up.Style
The style of the film is amazing, the landscapes of New Zealand where it was filmed it as beautiful as ever which is advanced by some legendary cinematography mixed with Howard Shore's epic score that just brings you into Middle Earth. Even though the film is 3 hours long it is paced perfectly and as I mentioned before keeps you invested throughout with some great action scenes.Overall
Overall, The Fellowship Of The Ring is one of the greatest films ever made, if you haven't seen this film then find not only 3 hours but nine hours to watch all of these films, heck maybe watch the extended editions but do it whenever you can as it is a must watch.Rating - 10/10."
toseale,"Oct 3, 2022",10/10,"It's just hard to complain about Fellowship of the Ring. Even the time isn't something I'm mad about, regardless of the fact that I watched the extended cut. There's just so much poise and beauty to this movie, even for one that didn't come from a time of great CGI and VFX that we have now. Peter Jackson did an outstanding job with this movie to the most minute detail. Every acting job is done amazingly, and I love every bit of it. One thing I found really interesting was the way humans are portrayed as these greedy people who are hard to manage, compared to such elegant and fun creatures across the Middle Earth. They really make our human conditions shine. From start to finish, there's so many layers of amazing things, and it just brings a smile to my face while watching. The action is sprinkled throughout in a good manner too. I just love Lord of the Rings."
carbon_69,"Jul 28, 2002",10/10,"I just have to say, that The Fellowship of the Ring is one of the best movie's that I have EVER seen!!! Although most of Peter Jackson's films weren't that great, he hit a goldmine with this one. And the cast was perfect. Ian McKellen had the perfect ability to seem both kind and friendly, as well as appear frightening when called for to portray Gandalf. Viggo Mortensen possesses the right amount of mystery and cunning to play Aragorn. Sean Astin has the dimwitted and homely quality to play Frodo's loyal friend Samwise. Elijah Wood, in a surprisingly new role astounded me as Frodo, able to show both his frightened side and his brave side. John Ryhs-Davies portrayed the proud and somewhat snobbish (in the line of elves) Gimli. Orlando Bloom, in an amazing breakthrough performance captured Legolas' quiet and graceful demeanor perfectly. Sean Bean played Boromir's greedy, yet nationalistic character wonderfully. Dominic Monaghan and Bill y Boyd played the dim-witted sidekicks of Frodo, Merry and Pippin, without flaw.It was a powerful adventure and I can't wait until December."
redflames185,"Jul 10, 2002",10/10,"The best movie I have seen in my lifetime. I would pay to see this again.This movie provided all kinds of movie making elements, such as: drama, suspense, horror, and even a bit of romance. I suggest this movie to all ages. My little 3 year old brother liked it. This is by far one of my favorite movies."
jiffygallant,"Aug 24, 2003",10/10,"It is the perfect Movie. The story, characters, action, and effects are all unmatched by anything that has ever been produced. It is even a better movie than it is book. What the book did for literature, this movie does for cinema. Any movie fan will enjoy this movie, having read the book or not. If you havent seen The Fellowship of the Ring, see it. It will warm your heart, excite your soul, and take you to place you have never been."
t_todd-14266,"Mar 4, 2019",10/10,"A world so distant never feels so close. The Lord of the Rings is an immersive experience, taking you along a journey of emotions as you absorb the beautiful landscapes in New Zealand along with one of if not the most iconic scores in film history. Attention to detail in costumes is some of the highest quality seen in film history, and CGI still holds up to many modern movies and tv. While not an exact replication of the novels, LoTR is possibly the most perfect."
bsbsavagebnl,"Jul 31, 2002",10/10,"I really thought all of the actors and actresses brought the book to life. For those of you who have read it, the movie helps to understand the book. If you haven't seen it, I suggest you do. Its a great movie with a great cast."
hamsandwich,"Dec 9, 2001",N/A,"Wow I have just had the best time in a cinema screen for years.At the moment I really cannot find a fault with the film. A note perfect performance from the whole cast, beautifully judged pacing, Whilst visually stunning. Peter Jackson mixes it up a treat; one minute filming with epic long shots of middle earth vistas crammed with detail, the next shooting extreme, fish-eye close ups and whipping the camera all over the place. i.e. as stately as a David Lean epic, whilst being kinetic enough to keep a modern audience satisfied... whateverI havent read the books, yet my palms were sweating throughout because I was so caught up in the film (Its surprisingly scary in parts), it felt like I hadn't blinked once! When you book your tickets to see this, just make sure you get some more for the performance after that. I can't wait to see it again.Wonderfull. Easily the best of the year."
coldnakedman,"Jul 25, 2002",10/10,"Whether it was the opening action sequences or the finale, my heart rate was going a mile a minute watching this movie.  FOTR did everything every other fantasy film should have done; it had fantastic creatures and beings that had previously only appeared in my dreams and my imagination.  Jackson did a tremendous job making tangible what I previously had to visualize by reading the books. Without getting too specific and spoiling the ending, my only critique of the movie was that it was a little anti-climatic.  Then again, the book was also anti-climatic because it was the first part of a trilogy.I would also like to comment about how many people have compared Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone to this film.  My advice is to see them both, don't compare them, and enjoy the each as the great stories they are.This is one of those movies that I will watch over and over again and never get tired of.  It wasn't boring.  It didn't lack action.  It wasn't overhyped.  The acting was good.  And those that said it had too many ""Scenery"" shots should consider Doctor Zhivago...it was 4 hours of trains and snow, but still a classic! Give this movie a shot, and enjoy it for what it is; the visualization of a classic tale."
HumanoidOfFlesh,"Feb 25, 2002",10/10,"I've never been a fan of fantasy(not read Tolkien's books),but Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings:The Fellowship of the Ring"" totally blew me away!This masterpiece is simply amazing!Everything here is excellent:the acting,the sets,the special effects by Richard Taylor etc.The film was shot in New Zealand for example in Matamata(Hobbiton),Kaitoke Regional Park(Rivendell),Glenorchy(Lothlorien)etc.My favourite characters are:Aragorn(Viggo Mortensen),Frodo Baggins(Elijah Wood),Galadriel(Cate Blanchett)and Boromir(Sean Bean).The film is full of incredibly beautiful images(the Dark Riders galloping on their horses etc.),some scenes like a fight with a huge Troll in Moria are literally unbelievable.I still can't believe that Peter Jackson,who was responsible for such excellent(and extremely gory-I might add!)horror movies like ""Bad Taste""(1987)and ""Braindead""(1992)created this masterpiece.I only hope he'll return to his splatter origins.10 out of 10-what else?I am waiting impatiently to see the following two parts."
m_richardson,"Feb 13, 2002",10/10,"I am a fan of Tolkien and have been eagerly awaiting someone to make a serious attempt at LOTR. The horible animated thing from the seventies - was, well, horrible. This movie succeeds fantasticaly well. The look and feel are just right - the technical aspects of the production - costumes artwork and photography - all done in such a way as to immerse you in a vision that respects the feel and spirit of the books. The casting is generally excellent - Elijah Wood is the perfect Frodo, Ian Mckellan an impressive and strong Gandalf. The screenplay keeps the essence of the story very well while shortening it to reasonable movie length (I am a fan - but I find the books have overly long bits that leave me wanting the story to progress a bit faster!) The other minor plot changes - such as having Arwen rescue Frodo are all enhancements that strengthen the story and help keep it ""tight"". The Mines of Moria were always a favourite scene from the book and when I saw it on the screen it was just as it had seemed in my head - something no other movie adaption of a book has ever achieved to to the same degree, for me. I am hard pressed to find anything but the most trivial criticism of what is a fantastic achievement.This movie is so close to perfect it would seem petty to point out its trivial faults."
joshuadrake-39480,"May 12, 2015",10/10,"I decided to do something new with this movie review. I will not only review the first film, I will review the entire trilogy. The plot follows Frodo Baggins as he goes on a journey to destroy the One Ring and with the help of the Fellowship and his friend, Samwise Gamgee and the evil / good creature Gollum, he is able to destroy the One Ring in the one place that he is created: Mount Doom.I love this trilogy and to this day, I think it is one of my favorite trilogies (others include The Matrix trilogy, the original and prequel STAR WARS trilogies, THE DARK KNIGHT TRILOGY and the original X-MEN trilogy), but I really thought that this trilogy was amazing and Peter Jackson gets a lot of praise for this film, King Kong, Tintin and the Hobbit trilogy and it is really amazing.The first 2 films are nearly three hours long, but the last film The Return of the King is 3 hours and 20 minutes long and I thought that would be way too long, but after the find ended I was not angry or bored.When I first watched The Fellowship of the Ring, it kept me interested and very amazed from beginning to the end, after that I watched The Two Towers, and it kept me emotionally engaged until the end credits and I was impressed with the climactic fight scene at Helm's Deep, then I finally got to The Return of the King and I could have not been happier with this one, it not only made a billion dollars when released in the theaters, but it won all 11 Oscars including Best Picture, making the third film the only fantasy film to win in each category.Not only you can get interested in the movies, you can also get interested in the characters and action, as well as the plot. Frodo is a cool character, played by Elijah Wood and his performance is amazing. Ian McKellen as Gandalf the White / Gandalf the Grey is really cool and amazing, he is a character that he is amazing, and his performance was great and I was angry that he did not get an Oscar for this role. Also, he was playing Magneto during production of the Lord of the Rings trilogy in the first, second and third X-MEN films.The character I was horrified about the first time I saw this film was Gollum, because of his split personality between Smeagol and Gollum and it was amazing to see him on screen, Andy Serkis played him and I liked him as Gollum in this trilogy and the first film in THE HOBBIT trilogy, An Unexpected Journey (2012), which was released in December 2012 and I did see it and I did see the second film and I really enjoyed it. My favorite scene is where Gollum is talking to himself and that was really funny and just well acted by Andy Serkis and this would lead him into playing the title role in Peter Jackson's KING KONG 2005 remake and Caesar, later on in RISE of the PLANET of the APES and DAWN of the PLANET of the APES and I can't wait to see him as Caesar in the next ""Planet of the Apes"" reboot film.These movies have some fantastic dialogue and action, especially in the second and third film. Every battle in this trilogy is amazingly well-done and spectacular and the added great CGI for this film trilogy.My favorite battles in The Fellowship of the Ring are when Arwen (played by Liv Tyler) saves Frodo and the battle inside Balin's Tomb and that was incredible and spectacular. My favorite battle in The Two Towers is the very, very, VERY long battle at Helm's Deep, that battle sequence was amazingly well-done. My favorite battle in The Return of the King is the end battle because there are two things happening: Frodo destroying the Ring and fighting Gollum and the entire Fellowship fighting against the Orcs.The cinematography, visual effects, production design, creature design, make-up effects, editing, musical score and atmosphere of this movie was an amazing job and it was also incredible and the direction by Peter Jackson is amazingly well-done and fantastic.Overall, this trilogy of films are incredible with every movie released and every time I watch these films are incredibly amazing. Yes, I will always love The Fellowship of the Ring for starting this trilogy, but The Two Towers is amazing and is a great improvement over the first film. My favorite one is the trilogy is The Return of the King, because it has better character development, better action sequences, better acting, better music and visual effects and most of all, the best ending to a film trilogy. I know a lot of people think that the ending is way too long in the third film, but I'm used to watching three to four hour long films at all. This is one trilogy that I don't think gets enough critical praise and credit.FINAL SCORE FOR ALL THREE LORD OF THE RINGS FILMS: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring - 8/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers - 9/10 The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King - 10/10 FINAL SCORE for the entire trilogy will be a 9.5 / 10"

sur4dude03,"Mar 22, 2003",10/10,"This movie could not have been better!! Peter Jackson smothers you in a world of enchantment and shows you things you never want to forget!! People might say that it was to unreal and the wizard's duel was dumb and to 'magical'! Thats where the term ""F-A-N-T-A-S-Y"" comes in!! This was an epic adventure with no flaws at all!! This amazing film, although it did not get BEST PICTURE ( WHICH IS BECAUSE THE AWARD PICKERS ARE WAITING UNTIL THE 3RD INSTALLMENT IS MADE), this is truly the greatest movie that has ever been made. It takes you back to Middle Earth and never lets you go, Lord of the Rings is amazing, enchanting, engrossing, incredible, enthralling, thrilling, terrific, and above all, PERFECT!!!!!!"
gavin-thelordofthefu-48-460297,"Dec 19, 2021",10/10,"Based on the first installment of the trilogy of J. R. R. Tolkien, The Fellowship of the Ring tells the story about a dark lord named Sauron who created the powerful ring that would rule all of Middle Earth. Despite the dark lord being destroyed, the spirit of the ring lived on for ages until one day, Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit leaves the Shire and leaves the ring to his nephew Frodo Baggins. However, Sauron's army seeks to find the One Ring and kill anyone who carries it. Aided by Gandalf, a powerful wizard, three hobbit friends Sam, Merry and Pippin along with Aragorn, a strider, Gimli, a dwarf, Legolas, an elf, and Boromir of Gondor, the group set off on a journey to Mount Doom and send the One Ring back to the fires where it was created.When I was a kid I was only into cartoons and then I came across the 1978 cartoon from Ralph Bakshi when it was on video (only parts of it until I saw the whole thing when it was on Cartoon Network) Later, when I was a teenage, I finally got into watching the trilogy and needless to say, I was blown away. This film is not only a great start to the trilogy but it's one of my favorite movies of all time. Not to mention that it got me into reading the book trilogy which is well written full of beautiful world building, great characters, an interesting lore surrounding Middle Earth, and engrossing action.The story is great and keeps up with the spirit of the source material. Not only that, it has emotional moments and great action sequences while having some character depth. The pacing while slow is very lively, the editing is superb, the directing from Peter Jackson is solid, and the cinematography is very gorgeous. Even the costumes are well designed.The music score from Howard Shore is great. Epic haunting, and sad which gives a neat atmosphere to the film especially the themes of Middle Earth and the characters as well. And last but not least the actors.Acting-wise, everyone gives a stellar performance. The late actors Christopher Lee and Ian Holm did great as Saruman the wizard who gathers Sauron's forces and Bilbo Baggins the hobbit who got possessed by the ring for a long time. The other actors did a great job too. Ian McKellen did fantastic as Gandalf the Grey, Viggo Mortensen did stellar as Aragorn, Orlando Bloom and John Rhy Davies did great as Legolas and Gimli, Sean Bean did a nice job as the corrupted Boromir, Liv Tyler and Hugo Heaving did great as Arwen and Lord Elrond, and the actors who played the hobbits did a stellar job too.Elijah Wood as the vulnerable hobbit Frodo, Sean Astin as his loyal friend Sam, and Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan did great as Pippin and Merry who share some nice humor while providing some loyalty too.Overall The Fellowship of the Ring is a great start to the Lord of the Rings movie trilogy and a solid adaptation of the book. It's been 20 years since it came out in the US."
SweetEvil,"Jun 2, 2002",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring was the most magnificant movie I have ever seen. From the sets to the costumes; from the acting to the directing; this movie has a stunning outcome. The most truly wonderful thing about this movie is the story. J.R.R. Tolkien had such a brilliant mind. His languages and creatures were ingenious. But, Peter Jackson was also brilliant in his glorious attempt to bring the books to life.First of all, the scenery was amazing. Hobbiton was exactly how I imagined it. Bilbo's hobbit hole at Bag End was quite a site. Moria was as dark and scary yet bold and beautiful as a mind could imagine it to be. Lorien was so incredibly beautiful. The quick glimpse shown of Minas Tirith was enough to tell us that Gondor will be a stunning site. The Great River and Amon Sul were also sights to behold. But the most beautiful thing created on the set was Rivendell. That is the closest thing any mind could compare to paradise. The sculptures and intricate carvings were amazing. The sets alone were a true accomplishment.The costumes were perfect. Arwen and Galadriel both wore stunning, flowing dresses. Gandalf wouldn't be Gandalf without his tall pointy hat and long staff. The elves magnificant garments and the hobbits adorable apparel only made the movie better.What pulls any movie together, to make it worth seeing is the acting. Elijah Wood has always shown off his wonderful acting talents and he proved once and for all that he is an amazing actor. Ian Mckellen seemed so wise and magical that if one didn't know better, you would have assumed he was a wizard. Viggo Mortensen was amazing. He turned from a mysterious ranger to a bold King. I know in the next to movies he will continue to amaze us. I wasn't too fond of Arwens increased part but Liv Tyler made it count. Sean Astin was perfect for Samwise Gamgee, the best friend someone could have. Two of my favorite characters of course were Merry and Pippin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd made the movie very enjoyable adding some comic relief. The rest of the cast were just as good in their roles. And it doesn't hurt that Orlando Bloom is incredibly attractive.All in all, everything about this movie helped to make my favorite books a reality. I hope I'll be able to wait for the next two."
darimoviesthoughtsoffilms,"Dec 25, 2019",N/A,"I will keep it short, because almost everyone has seen this film. This is a spoiler-free review aswell.The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an awesome movie. It is kind of like a combination of multiple genres: It is most fantasy but there is also action, romance and a good bit of horror (Moria) plus some jokes as topping. The casting aswell as the performances are great, the special effects holds up suprisingly well and the ending is magnificent. Score is also fantastic.I'm not fanboying when I say that it is a 10/10, because this movie is almost as near perfect one can be, and the sequels does not dissapoint (at least the two following). If you haven't watched it yet, I strongly suggest that you go buy the whole trilogy!"
budde,"Dec 19, 2001",6/10,"This movie has incredible special effects and the cinematagraphy is excellent.  Watching the movie is more like a trip to watch a gallery of incredible pictures as opposed to getting wrapped up in a movie.  At almost 3 hours long, you would think they could have developed the characters a little more.  It seems like this movie is more concerned with making mention to as many parts of the book as possible and not going into depth about anything.  If you get up and leave after the first hour, you won't miss much."
waari,"Mar 18, 2002",1/10,"After seeing this movie about 20 times and having read the books countless times and since my hobby is, and has been for 20 something years, watching movies I think I can make review ...The movie as a action / adventure / fantasy movieThis is the category lotr fares best, all the basic elements of a decent movie are present, a horrible enemy that tries take over the world, a hero (and his friends, that include the comic relief), a object that destroys the enemy, lots of monsters, fight's & cliffhangers. As a ""popcorn"" movie it is quite good, although the movie is maybe a bit too long, for an action movie that is, the audience receives what it is looking and waiting for and visually the movie is quite nice indeed. Just as a action / adventure / fantasy movie I would give it a 7.5 / 10 maybe closer to 8 even, but it's not something that would blow my mind, all this has been seen in countless other movies, maybe in different form, in different surroundings, but still nothing ground breaking.The movie as a movieThis is where it hit's thin ice. Character's are very shallow, their motives and their personalities are left in the dark (other that can be shown in fights) eg. Frodo run's into Merry & Pippin in some field, and so they decide to follow Frodo, albeit they have no idea where they are going and why, had the movie established that they were good friends before it had been a lot easier to understand. Story is driven forward with a really fast pace (after Frodo leaves Shire that is) and unfortunately it is done with the expence of the story, all emphasis is given to action, action and more action. The characters are as basic as movie characters go, you got the comic relief (Merry & Pippin) the unbeatable warrior (Aragorn) the turncoat (Boromir) and so forth, and since the movie ""had"" to be modernized you also need the ""femme fatale"" (Arwen) and still this would be tolerable IF the characters were something more than a aid that just runs the movie forward. One other major problem is that the movie is ""pre chewed"" nothing is left to the viewer, the director takes the easy way out and so underestimates the viewers badly, I think it's rather sad really. So what does the movie leave you with ? well basicly your typical action adventure that is set in fantasy land. It's a typical hollywood production that emphasis on glitter rather than substance. As a movie I would rate it about 6 / 10The movie as a adaptation of Tolkien's workWell, what can I say ? basicly it takes just the basic storyline and forget's everything else, it's so horribly different from the book that it makes me cringe in terror. Those who disagree with me should really read the book's ... Peter Jackson is surely entitled to his vision but he shouldn't say that the movie is faithfull, since it is not. Jackson took the easy way to make this movie, he forgot about the soul of the book and made a action movie instead. Timeline is totally wrong, parts are cut out (like Bombadil) parts are added (like Arwen) since it needs to be ""modern"" I have read several review's here that say that the books needed to be modernized, may I ask why ? dont see a reason personally. I am not going to start to list everything that is changed, as I would need several pages more room, I am sure that if you want you can find places in internet that list the changes. As a Tolkien adaptation my rate is 3 / 10Bottomline is that while lotr is quite enjoyable and should be seen if this genre appeals to you it's not that special, when Jackson made the movie he tried to target as broad audience as possible and so had to seriously alter the books in order to make it more appealing. Visually quite stunning (the landscape) and with good actor's it's nice, althought nothing that would deserve it's present ranking..."
Thecritichood234,"Nov 1, 2023",10/10,"This is my first time, watching a lord of the rings movie and oh my god what a breath of fresh air this movie got me hooked from beginning to end. I really like a lot of stuff so let's get into it. First I really like how the characters were not a mess or all just feel like they are trying to take the spotlight from one another they all have there own motivation that try to prove themselves and also tried the prove that they are worthy of a good fight, in this movie, Frodo, Sam, Aragorn, are honorable mentions for the best character in his movie but by far the best character in the movie in my opinion is Gandolf he does show that he can give us some tension on what's to come, when I first watched the movie I thought the beginning was going to be boring. Give us some useless information and just drag it out but no it gives us important information on whats to come and what's the come throughout the whole trilogy I can't wait to see what going to happen in these movies because I am into this adventure. I really like this first movie 10/10."

ringbearer2003,"Mar 10, 2003",10/10,"I have always loved the books written by J.R.R. Tolkien, but I never expected that anyone would ever make a film out of it, or that it would be such a big success!  Peter Jackson made the books real to me, and I try to watch it at least once a month, if not a lot more than that!  The entire cast was perfectly placed, and they all worked so good together, that I am so mad that they don't let the other two films out on DVD right away!"
jacobmeyerjkm,"Feb 2, 2020",10/10,"This isn't a film. It's an epic. If you ask 10 people why they think the Lord of the Rings trilogy is so brilliant, chances are you'll get 10 different answers. This trilogy has something for everyone. Friendship, action, a brilliant score, wonderful effects, an entertaining story, emotion, romance, bromance, betrayal... twice, world-building, and that's just the beginning."
jameskortar,"Oct 20, 2014",10/10,"This is one of the few movies I've seen that does justice to the book it represents. True, it doesn't follow the story exactly, but Peter Jackson did about as good a job as you can expect anyone to do in three hours. This movie is incredible. There simply is nothing to complain about. The acting is superb, with several cast members giving the performance of a lifetime. The special effects are breathtaking, and the stunts and fight scenes very memorable. This film captivates you from the very start, when it tells the story of the rings, and holds you until the last moment, where we are left to wonder about the fate of the scattered fellowship (well, those who never read the books, at least). I knew this film was a masterpiece when my wife, who hates the fantasy genre, insisted on seeing it 3 times in theaters. This movie is the best! i highly recommend it for anyone but small children. the battle scenes are great. Elijah Wood was once more playing the innocent hobbit on a journey. There is nothing but pure perfection in this film, and doubtless it will become as classic and legendary as the book that inspired it."
jaybob,"Dec 19, 2001",10/10,"I did not read the book, This is a report on the film. We  must find a new superlative  to describe the look of this movie, There were  many scenes that reminded me  of some adventure films I loved as a lad, FOUR FEATHERS,THIEF OF  BAGHDAD,  the Indiana jones & star wars trilogys. This is a 3 hr film with hardly a second of wasted time. The acting as well as the Music, costumes, makeup  etc  are all Oscar worthy. my rating is  a very high  ****     (the highest I go)"
a-games-136-715468,"May 17, 2017",N/A,"16 Years ago when I was 9, I bought a VHS of Fellowship of the Ring and as soon as I watched it, I was enhanced with the world, the characters, creatures and visuals and my mind was blown - I had not seen a film like this. The movie is more than sheer brilliance - its phenomenal and undeniably passionate movie-making on a flawless scale - from the unforgettable and fantastic acting from a brilliant ensemble to the splendid writing that develops the character, kick- starts a great story with thought-provoking themes and builds a glorious fantasy world to the intense and impressive action set pieces.Based on the book with the same name and set in the world of Middle- Earth, The Fellowship of the Ring sees young hobbit Frodo Baggins inherit a magical ring from his uncle, Bilbo, that is revealed to have been created by the Dark Lord Sauron, who was destroyed during a battle with the forces of Men and Elves. If Sauron regains the ring, he can regain physical form and bring destruction to Middle- Earth. As Sauron's forces desperately seek the ring across the land, Frodo and a group of eight companions - comprising of the wise wizard Gandalf, mysterious ranger Aragorn, Frodo's loyal companion (and love interest) Sam, Frodo's mischievous cousins Merry and Pippin, elf prince Legolas, fearsome dwarf Gimli and the troubled, but heroic warrior Boromir - set out from Rivendell to the fires of Mount Doom where the ring can only be destroyed.So where can I start? The film perfectly captures Tolkien's world from the books by using beautiful sets and using New Zealand landscapes to visualise it, backed up by fantastic performances from the entire cast (including the creatures), the use of brilliant CGI with prosthetics & practical effects and big-atures, an intriguing script to bring a monumental story to life and the unforgettable action scenes (intense and thrilling fight in Balin's Tomb, Gandalf's stand against the Balrog, the prologue with Sauron as a bad-ass and the heart- poundingly stirring fight at Amon Hen). The film, like its successors, is epic in every way - from cinematography to costumes to its music score to its flawless directing - setting the standard from filmmaking and being the most revolutionary films in the fantasy genre. Even though The Two Towers is the best installment (and my preferred favourite) in the Rings Trilogy, I'll admit that Fellowship is the most flawless in the trilogy. Overall, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is an undeniably outstanding achievement in cinema and a fantastic start to the greatest trilogy of all time and all three films are utterly phenomenal.Pros: The script & story, the cast & characters, flawless direction, action scenes, beautiful cinematography, Howard Shore's stirring score, practical effects/prosthetics with great CGI, the use of on- location and Boromir's death is the most emotional (and possibly the best) death in the entire trilogyCons: Frodo is a bit stiff in a few scenes, I didn't care for how the characters make Boromir look untrustworthy when he's a deeply troubled individual, Galadriel and Arwen could have been more developed as characters and Sam crying out for Frodo in the cornfield is the most cringiest moment in the entire LOTR trilogy"
thelockbox,"Feb 12, 2002",6/10,"The Lord of the Rings is a good movie, especially for this year, but it is in no way above classics such as Citizen Kane or Shawshank Redemption or even Momento. Just because Jackson did a good job at capturing the book's character's appearance and personalities, doesn't qualify it to be the second best movie of all time. It has no message, it's just a very well told fantasy story. So stop giving it praise it doesn't deserve. It's an 8 not a 9 or a 10."
gtmac1,"Dec 28, 2001",1/10,"I've been a Tolkien fan for many years and a lover of film for more years than that.  Here's what I have to say about it.Stop accepting another's interpretation of a literary work and start demanding originality and quality in all media.  Things shouldn't have to be wrapped up in a nice neat 'film-book-music-fast food promo-fan mag-toy' package to be enjoyed.  Adaptations should be spurned, not praised.  Enjoy a good film, enjoy a good book, but don't require or allow them to be homogenized.Stop accepting eye-candy as cinematic genius.  Stop identifying special effects as good film on it's own.  Demand character and plot development. Demand intelligent dialogue and exposition instead of silly taglines and ""here's what's happening"" lines.  Demand acting above just smiling, crying, and scowling.  How about some complex emotions?I'm not saying there is not room for a cheesy movie now and then, but don't champion them as pinnacles of the medium.Remember or imagine what a film could be.  Don't pay $9 to go sit in front of the television for 2-3 hours.  Demand to be challenged even a little bit. PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE!  For those of us who care!  If you keep paying to go see mediocrity, they'll keep making it!"
sugarbot,"Feb 17, 2002",10/10,"This is truly the greatest movie of all time! No other movie will win me over like this one has. The acting, sound effects, special effects, make-up, etc. were all wonderful. They did really good by not putting some REALLY famous actors/actresses in there to make people go see it, it was good enough on its own. The actors they did choose were excellent! My favorites were Elijah Wood and Orlando Bloom. I am thrilled that it is nominated for 13 awards and wish it were nominated for more! I saw couldn't get enough of this movie, I ended up seeing it five times, that is before it was taken of the theater. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone, it truly is the best, most brilliant movie ever. Those who haven't seen it really should, you won't regret it. I can't wait to see the next two movie sequels, they will only make the whole movie better. As for those who totally don't the movie, I can only say one thing. I read in a newspaper article that tests show that those who disliked the movie had a lower I.Q. than those who liked it. What else is there to say? Besides Lord of the Rings RULES! and hurry up with the next movie!"
Reviewer32,"Jan 5, 2024",10/10,"I've watched this movie the first time it was released when I was young (my father took me to cinema theater in my hometown) and I watched it now in 2024 for the roughly of total 20th time during the past years until now. As I've made a longer pause between my last watch and this one, just to see whether this movie is really a masterpiece now that I'm older than before - and it fricking is! I cannot stress this enough. This movie has made my life better and more dreamy at times whereas it stands alone as one of the best cinematic experience (and overall artistic pieces) that made an impact on me. Moreover, for a great number of years I even didn't perceive it as a cimema (for example, forgetting to mention it as one of my favorite movies) but it felt almost surreal for me. At the moment, it is the nostalgia that hits the hardest with this last watch. I've recalled my childhood memories, emotions, imagination that I had after swallowing the fairytale content from this movie and everything that this masterpiece was delivering to me throughout all these years.Bravo movie!"
miguelneto-74936,"Sep 19, 2016",10/10,"when Peter Jackson decided to adapt the tales of Tolkien master, the greatest work of history of fantasy, The Lord of The Rings, I believe that many were with a behind foot, who would say that this work could be adapted more Peter Jackson adapts brilliantly Peter hit full in the choice of casting, Elijah Wood is his best role in his career, Sean Astin this great, Ian McKellen dispenses comments, impeccable as Gandalf, Viggo Mortensen, Christopher Lee, Ian Holm, Baker Hall, John Rhys-Davies, Sean Bean, Hugo Weaving, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Orlando Bloom, Dominic Monaghan, Billy Boyd, and etc., the cast is spectacular, and the acting is much of great, the special effects are incredible, even more epoch that was released, the picture is beautiful, the film adapts well to land-media, the costumes are incredible, the opening scene of the film is one of the best of film history, which explains everything we know about the rings, the battle scenes are impeccable, the characters are great, my favorites are Smaug (which appears little longer appears in the next film), Gandalf, Aragorn, Sean and Legolas., the film is over, spend more flying, the pace is very good, and the script even with some problems, is very good, the Lord of the Rings: the Fellowship of the Ring is the beginning of a trilogy that had been in the film history.

gcsman,"Apr 2, 2023",10/10,"Just back from seeing Fellowship of the Ring at a special screening from one of our local indy cinemas. I have the Extended Editions of all three on DVD, but I'd never seen the EE on the big screen before, and wow was it worth it. It's an immersive experience like little else I've ever had at the movies. The audience I was in was filled (mostly) with people too young to have seen the original release back in 2001, or else parents who would have gone to the original now taking their kids to it. The whole theater was raptly silent through it all, laughed and gasped at the appropriate places, and applauded at the end. I really think the Extended Editions take care of most of the shortcomings or gaps in the original theater-release versions, and by now should be the canonical versions.All three of the LOTR films get a 10/10 from me, but you can make a reasonable argument that Fellowship is the best of them. There's so much material, so much ground to cover, done so well! It has the crucial job of starting off the epic task of building an entire world in front of our eyes, setting the scene, and introducing most of the key characters: and the stakes were high. Had this opener failed, the rest of the trilogy would have been dead in the water and maybe would have brought down New Line Cinema with it. Scene after scene that sticks in the memory: the lengthy Introduction with Cate Blanchett's silky voice narrating. The Shire, of course. The inn at Bree, and Weathertop. The ride to the fords of Bruinen. Rivendell and the Council of Elrond. Moria and the bridge of Khavad-Dum. Lothlorien. The Riven Anduin, the Argonath, Boromir, the splitting of the Fellowship. Peter Jackson and his immense New Zealand crew succeeded in conjuring an entire self-consistent universe for us to live in that, still, no other fantasy movie has ever come close to achieving. And in each of the three movies there are scenes that I can only call transcendent -- so riveting and cinematically brilliant that they leap right into your heart. One of these is the Mirror of Galadriel. In Two Towers, the very opening. In Return of the King, the chain of signal fires. And think of the major role of Howard Shore's musical score; hyper-romantic, heroic, edgy, comforting, delicate by turns; his themes (leitmotifs, really, like Wagner operas) are as dominant as any character. It's kind of impossible to recall any part of the trilogy without that musical score running through your head. For years, one friend of mine listened to the score on an almost weekly basis, and who can fault him?One VERY important thing that struck me right from the first viewing back in 2001 was how much attention was paid to the historical context of Middle-Earth. We're looking at a world that has already had thousands of years of history and conflict. It's an old civilization and the sense of deep history is being put right in front of us -- the old watchtower of Amon Sul (Weathertop), the ancient mines of Moria and the dwarven halls, the immense old statues of the Argonath, crumbling ruins from ages past, everywhere the Fellowship goes. What's being played out in LOTR at the end of the Third Age is really just the end-game to a long, long story stretching back to the First Age, when the ultimate lord of evil Morgoth was defeated by the gods at Thangorodrim. The equally long Second Age finished up with the Last Alliance of Elves and Men on the slopes of Mount Doom in a bigger, more titanic battle than anything the Third Age would see. This richness of invention is incredibly impressive.And then there's the cast. This series made stars out of Elijah Wood, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Karl Urban, Sean Astin, and half a dozen others in career-defining roles. The already-big stars like Cate Blanchett and Ian McKellen and Hugo Weaving rose further, and two decades later they are indelibly linked with their LOTR roles.I want to go on and on but I'd be repeating what you can find in any number of reviews elsewhere. So to say again, the LOTR film trilogy is a bloody miracle. Inevitable followups have come along (the Hobbit trilogy of course, and the new Rings of Power series) that are actually not bad. Taken on their own merit, they have great production values and decent acting. It's just that they can't match up to one of the high-water marks of all of cinematic history.I'm still waiting for someone (Peter Jackson, are you listening?) to take on the story that was actually Tolkien's favorite, the one closest to his heart. That's the one with Luthien and Beren, Morgoth and the First Age, the one that set off his whole work on the history of Middle-Earth. Gods, demigods, heroes, monsters, romance, pure good and evil and everything in between -- it's got it all just like LOTR. Well, maybe someday."
inserrtnamehere,"Jan 3, 2015",10/10,"This film (along with the entire trilogy) is regarded as one of the greatest, most influential films of all time and with good reason. This movie has audiences captivated from the beginning to the end. Even watching it in 2015, I am still stunned by the special effects, the set, the scenery, the acting, the plot, the camera shots and angles, the make up, the costumes, and the editing among many other factors. Most note-worthy is the score which brings a whole new perspective and sound to science fiction and to fictitious worlds and characters. Even though the story contains a lot of sci-fi jargon, the writing and dialog do a very good job in relaying the information to the audience. The writers did an excellent job in simplifying and clarifying an intricate and brilliant story.Well done Peter Jackson. You deserve the fame and fortune you received from this movie."
bigguy728,"Mar 17, 2002",10/10,"I left this movie yearning to see it again and again!  And I did so- four times in the theater.  I can't wait till it is released on DVD, or until the rest of the trilogy is released.  From one who has read the books, I have to say it stayed very true to them.  A few omissions were made, but they were necessary to keep the movie down to three hours.  Now onto the good stuff. Casting was excellent.  I can't think of a better person to play Frodo than Elijah Wood, nor a better person to play Gandalf than Ian McKellan.  The other hobbits were played very well, and notable performances were given by Viggo Mortensen and Orlando Bloom.  Cate Blanchett and Liv Tyler played their parts very well, too.  The landscapes, shot in New Zealand, were simply breathtaking.  The Shire and Bilbo's house were just as I imagined them.  The background music complimented the action very well, and the visual effects, especially the Balrog, were stunning.  I am also particular to the storyline, but I think it could not have been done better.  Good luck at the Oscars!"
Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187,"Nov 16, 2016",10/10,"The Fellowship of the Ring is the starting point for the now classic Lord of the Rings film trilogy, and while aspects of the movies haven't aged too well (like the rubbery CGI rag-doll stunt effects), they're still joys to watch and you are truly in Middle-earth. Peter Jackson brings his bombastic and theatrical sensibilities with these movies and his direction brings something from across the emotional spectrum of many different cinematic genres; and the experience works so well.For any lover of Tolkien, such as myself, it's notable and incredibly obvious when Jackson takes creative liberties; but the changes from the novels are necessary. In spite of some of the inevitable changes when making the movies, they play out fine in the end: the changes add nice drama to the story and there's still nice visual subtlety in the performances from the magnificent cast of Ian McKellen, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Sean Bean, Viggo Mortensen, Billy Boyd, Dominic Monaghan, Orlando Bloom and John Rhys-Davies.The film is full of classic moments like the Mines of Moria sequence, the Lothlórien scenes and of course the good-old Shire: the locations of the Baggins of Bag End. There are so many remarkable things in this movie. Everything right down to the music is well done here and adds to one of the most well-realized fantasy film settings in history.I'd want to thank Peter Jackson personally for giving us the three movies of his fantastical magnum opus based on one of the greatest novels of our time."
hrrcgh,"Jun 19, 2023",N/A,"This movie is simply a masterpiece that deserves all the praise it receives. It is in fact the one film that got me hooked not only on the Lord of the Rings franchise, but the entire genre of fantasy. The cinematography is breathtaking, the landscapes are stunning (i gotta visit New Zealand one day!), the characters, the dedication, the story in itself is perfect . I usually don't like movie adaptions of books so much, however Peter Jackson changed my mind with this well paced, well written and very well implemented piece of art. This is exactly how fantasy should be, classic yet versatile, a composition of epic battles, love, friendship and adventure, forming an effortlessly captivating story."
chriss17eu,"Dec 21, 2025",7/10,"This first part of one of cinema's greatest sagas began, for me, with very modest expectations. My experience with the book was negative, which made me fear that the film would be overwhelming and tedious due to its density. However, the surprise is overwhelmingly positive from the very beginning.The film stands out for its remarkable production values. The performances are solid, the cinematography is extremely crafted, detailed, and impressive, with effects that still hold up remarkably well today. The set design is equally strong, adding depth and character to the world. The soundtrack may not linger in memory, but it works perfectly for this kind of film. Overall, the result is enjoyable both visually and aurally.I greatly appreciate Peter Jackson's narrative clarity. The book can be overwhelming with its abundance of names, places, and concepts, but Jackson translates all that into a visual language that is both clear and accessible. The information is presented intelligently, allowing the viewer to follow the story without feeling lost or overwhelmed.The differences between the book and the film are undeniable, but far from detrimental. On the contrary, they enhance the experience. Nothing feels sacrificed; the story gains cohesion and rhythm. I had feared the film's runtime-not because it lasts nearly four hours, but due to the potential density of the plot-but the pacing dispels that concern. The nearly four-hour length never becomes an obstacle, especially when the final half-hour is credits.I wouldn't say the film completely captivates me, but this first installment leaves a positive impression. It is a grand welcome to Tolkien's universe, demonstrating that adaptations can honor the source material while improving the cinematic experience by understanding potential pitfalls and avoiding them."
Anaisnine,"Dec 22, 2001",1/10,"Ok..b4 we get into this let me preface by saying I'm a HUGE fantasy fan. As a child I read loads of mythology and as I got older I got into fantasy novels, and yes, I even enjoy a good sword and sorcery flick.  When I first saw the trailer for LOTR a year ago my jaw hit the floor. I coulndt not WAIT to see this movie...and so a year passed. I came to the theater wanting to be swept away into the majesty that is Tolkein...I came wanting to be blown away and fall irredeemably in love with the film. Sigh...maybe I wanted too much.Now the film is not bad, not bad at all..in fact in all honesty I can say that it is prob among the top 5 films released this year(which may not m,ean much considering what came out this year)  Yet..I did not come away with a magical feeling..that warm feeling inside when u know u have had a truly good movie experience.  I came away  a bit fatigued(3 hrs is 3 hrs) and midly dissapointed.The good: overall, I'd say the cast is very good. Id aways thought Viggo was a good actor and he finally got a role he could shine in. Ian Mckellar was great as a somewhat vulnerable Gandolph and Ian Holm was delicious as Bilbo...he made a hobbit actually seem creepy. And the guy who played Samwise(the boy from the goonies) was actually good as well.Even Liv Tyler was impressive(though tolkein purists will claim she had no business in the book) and of course Ms. Blanchett did her usual best(with a narroly defined role).The bad:  the script- I just felt( and still do) that if you have read the books( and mr.jackson was admitedlly a HUGE Tolkein buff) you got alot more out of the movie. I think maybe he assumed a prior knowledge and relationship w/ the characters  cuz there was very little development of the characters and their relationships to each other. Thats why when a certain cast member died,..I really felt everyone was taking it a bit too hard on screen, lol.  Secondly, the dialogue could be on the cheesy side. Now, I know its Tolkein..but at least let me fall in love with the characters b4 u get all cheesy and sentimental on me...at least the two bumbling hobbits were there for a bit of comic releif.CGI- was it just me, or was the rendering horrible?  Cgi is always noticeable even if done well..but some scenes were just embarassingly bad. Also, the cinematography was not very crisp..I felt like I was watching the movie thru a haze the whole time. Now granted..the technical failings of the movie dont really bear much on how much I enjoy the plot..but still, for all the money spent..I dunno, I would have thought at least the cinematography would be good.pacing: point blank...when the characters weretn running for their lives..it dragged.  Since the script failed to get me involved with the characters, I just was blase at best about any reflections they may have . This was especially apparent at the initial 'meeting of the fellowship' scene. Suddenly there are all these characters  that have no discernable relationship whatsoever...yet, they all weep like babies when that certain cast member died...didnt make much sense to me. Now dont get me wrong...there were a few poignant moments( i liked the scene with sam at the end..touching....and Sean bean's charac too..touching) but to me..it was all disjointed...very little flow..I could never really sink my teeth into the film.So, instead of being ravenous for the next installement when the film finally ended..I left like 'well..maybe the next one will be better'. Now, I will say, it was alot better than Phantom Menace..I was never  just bored outright..but for all the hype and commotion..I was underwhelmed. Dont let fantasy/tolkein groupies lead u astry, its a good film..but not a great film and nowhere near as good as the first Star Wars trilogy. Sigh...everywhere that I go I read reviews of this nature..so much so that next week I shall see the film again and see if therw was somenthing I missed the first time-A.N."
NORWOLF1,"Jun 1, 2002",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Rings is a movie for our times. If we look past the stunning visual effects, lush scenery, and spectacular action sequences, and listen to the wisdom of Gandalf and Galadriel we hear the quiet whisper of the true meaning of the film- heroism. The message of this film is that true heroes are not the great and powerful, but the everyday person placed unexpectedly into trying circumstances. What a message at this time in our country's history. On September 11th we saw normal, everyday peoples lives changed suddenly, unexpectedly. They were forced to be heroes, to work to save not only their own lives, but the lives of others too. As Gandalf says, we do not choose what times we live in, but we choose what we do with the time we have.Remember this theme and focus on Frodo's trials and perserverance whenever you watch this movie. Remember the loyalty and friendship of Sam. That is what this movie is truly about.Peter Jackson has created a visually stunning film, filled with action, yet rich with meaning. He has for the most part stayed true to the themes and sequences in the books. While he has changed some characters and scenes, those changes do not significantly alter the plot and in some instances actually improve it.Though the movie is played out on a grand scale, the film is really about a story of one little hobbit, Frodo, and his unexpected challenge of having to be a hero.The score by Howard Shore is superb, quite worthy of the Oscar it received. The score is destined to become a classic.The cinematography is also superb, also definitely worthy of its Oscar.My one criticism, is that Saruman is given more time on screen than in the books. I felt he should be more so behind the scenes as he was in the books. The more sinister evil is the evil that cannot be seen. Though Christopher Lee, as always, is superb.The rest of the cast is also superb, especially Ian McKellen as Gandalf and Elijah Wood as Frodo. Kate Blanchett and Liv Tyler are also excellent in their roles, bringing a strong female presence."
Jordankenney6,"Jul 18, 2013",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.The first chapter in Peter Jackson's beautiful re-imagining of Middle- Earth created by J.R.R Tolkien's best selling novels comes a story of friendship, trust, hope and tragedy. A small, shy Hobbit Frodo Baggins gets more than he bargained for when he has to protect a magical ring from evil hands and save Middle-Earth from eternal darkness. I could go into a lot more detail but I don't want to spoil the superb story-line. Just know it's of memorable quality and definitely keeps you engaged until the end.Story: 10/10I'll touch on the wonderful visuals created by Peter Jackson, from The Shire all the way to the Mines of Moria and Amon Hen these all look beautiful and unique, Peter really wanted to create something memorable, unforgettable and spectacular here. The characters all look unique and easy to tell apart. Elves look like Elves, Dwarfs like Dwarfs and Orcs like, well, Orcs. The costume design is great, the CGI effects and locations are stunning, even to today's standards. With the Blu-Ray edition of these movies you are getting a real treat visually.Visuals: 10/10The next thing to explain about, is the sound design. Howard Shore gives his musical excellence here to provide a truly breath-taking soundtrack. When the audience is meant to feel happy, the music is heart warming and cheerful, when you are meant to cry the music deepens down and hits your heart strings emotionally. The music does a perfect job of immersing you in this fantasy world and really keeps you there until the experience is over. The dialogue is key to success also, the actors all provide key and believable dialogue here, the sound design is also as fantastic as the visuals.Audio: 10/10The acting is key here, you wouldn't a bad actor in any main role of such a high expected movie. Elijah Wood provides his role as young Frodo Baggins and plays him extremely well here, accompanied by Sean Astin as Sam-Wise Gamgee. The stand performance in this movie has to be Ian Mckellen as Gandalf the Grey, his timing with his lines is perfect, his facial expressions are spot on and his commitment to the role is also worth mentioning, all the actors seemed to have fun in their roles and all seemed pleased with their deliverance of performance. Viggo Mortensen, Orlando Bloom, Hugo Weaving and Cate Blanchett also provide roles as chief characters in this masterpiece as all the acting is of top standard.Acting: 10/10The overall verdict of The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring is ...Perfect visuals, a masterpiece of a soundtrack and superb acting. Overall I put this as one of my favourite movies of all time and this is definitely worth the highest mark.Movie: 10/10"

sandnair87,"Jan 11, 2016",10/10,"The Lord of the Rings trilogy is a spectacle with the emotional charge of a thunderbolt on a canvas brushed with master strokes. With authority and disarming creative propensity, director Peter Jackson creates mystic illusions borne from J.R.R. Tolkien's epic novel. The result is a marvelous journey, where gentle hobbits, powerful wizards and humans meld with trolls, misshapen orcs, black-cloaked ring-wraiths and Uruk-Hai.In the first chapter The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring, the magical land of Middle-earth is the fictional setting, but it's no backdrop; it's a living, breathing universe, in which mild-mannered hobbit Frodo Baggins (a brilliant Elijah Wood) is forced to turn hero when he inherits the ring of absolute power - the one that grants long life, invisibility and carries with it the inevitable seduction of evil. Assisted by powerful wizard Gandalf (a perfectly cast Ian McKellen) and a motley fellowship of warriors, he must journey across Middle Earth to return the talisman to its source. Frodo's entourage includes the brooding but valiant ranger Aragorn (a mesmerizing Viggo Mortensen), the scheming but brave Boromir (Sean Bean) and the dashing elfin archer Legolas (Orlando Bloom). Also along for the adventure are three of Frodo's mischief-making hobbit chums from the Shire. Frodo sets out with this coterie on an epic quest to carry the ring into the core of the vanquished dark lord Sauron's lair, who has been hot on the hunt, to destroy it in the searing fires of Mount Doom.Their journey is fraught with adventure, as the fellowship does extensive battle with all sorts of rogues along the way. Orchestrating all the evil-doing is the fallen wizard Saruman (a marvelously malevolent Christopher Lee), who has gone over to the dark side and battles wits with the cagey old Gandalf. All along the way, there's plenty of soul-searching as Frodo questions his fate and his comrades must fight off the sinister allure of the magical gold ring. And it's in this aspect that Jackson elevates the film beyond mere adventure escapism. He treats the story's metaphorical properties with due gravity, but without falling into turgid sermonizing. He strikes a nice balance of deeper meaning and sheer entertainment.Weighty with Middle-earth lore and eye-dazzling vistas of the storybook Shire, the Elvish town of Rivendell and ravaged land of Mordor; alive with the personalities of jaunty hobbits, toiling gnomes, enchanting elves and dashing warriors, the film is a fine wonder of technical achievement and masterly acting in service of a rich, rousing and meaningful story. The computer-generated images transform the New Zealand locations into views that will take your breath away and only someone with a pathological aversion to fantasy could fail to be absorbed and transported by this stunning, sincere and frequently terrifying adaptation. Cinematically inspiring, the costume, production design, prosthetic body parts and make up are extraordinary in their detail, complete in every way.Peter Jackson does not only attempt the most ambitious film project in modern cinema history, he pulls it off with a breathtaking mixture of nerve and verve, conjuring the most potent major-motion-picture magic in years."
DieGefaehrtin,"May 21, 2002",10/10,"well, ""the lord of the rings"" has always been my favourite book. when i first heard about the movie, i decided to boycott it. I mean, it's so annoying to not be the only one loving the novel anymore. for years i've tried to convince people to read the book and nobody wanted to/had the time to/was interessted in it. and just because there was some hollywood-blockbuster made, everybody around me has turned into a ""lord of the rings-expert"". so, can't change that anyway but didn't ever want to watch the movie because I thought there was no chance that anyone could ever bring the shire to live the way i've been imagining it. boy, was i wrong... some friends of mine ""convinced"" me to watch it (=told me they had tickets for ""Le pacte de loupes"" and waited for me to find out which movie we were actually watching) And, what can I say, I loved it. i totally lost myself in the beautiful landscape and the (let's not deny it) HOT actors. Although I should hate my friends for tricking me into watching it, i'm now a big fan of the movie myself."
loco12,"Mar 28, 2002",10/10,"Well what can you say that hasn't been said before 2,900 times. One of the biggest films of all time, and a tragedy that the boffoons at the Academy voted snoozathon A Beautiful Mind as best film. Yes it was OK but really how many times have we seen movies similar to that?Lord Of The Rings: The Fellowship Of The Ring, had everything one could wish for. Top notch acting, a dramatic storyline, superb cinematography, Stunning landscapes and a classic soundtrack!Some reviewers have stated it is too long. I say it's not long enough and I could have quite happily have sat in the theatre for another hour no problem.I also noticed that many people have voted this film a 1. IMDb should have another top film table, minus the silly ""1"" votes. This film could never, ever be a one in anyones imagination.I, like many here, have read and loved the books. Watching the movie we see the images that were conjured up in our minds when reading the books. So many have said its exactly what they imagined it's almost uncanny but fantastic to behold. I totally agree.As for a lot of the doubters saying its not a patch on The Godfather, Shawshank, etc, well they wouldn't know whan a real classic came along to join these great movies. Yes, Godfather is a good movie, Shawshank is a good movie (though in my opinion slightly overated) But LOTR is the fantasy classic of our time. 20 years from now LOTR will have earned itself the status of classic fantasy adventure, with virtually no doubter whatsoever, a landmark that other films will strive, and mostly fail to achieve.Thank you Peter Jackson for bringing Middle-earth to life for so many of us grateful fans. Personally I can't wait for the extended DVD, with the extra 30 minutes of unseen footage, which arrives in November.cheers"
Rogue-32,"Feb 26, 2002",10/10,"I've seen the film three times now and it gets better with each viewing. Peter Jackson told Charlie Rose (on tv) the other night that he wanted to make a film which transported him to another place, like the films he saw as a child did; he said films didn't really do that very much these days. I could not agree with him more.  This was one of the things that impressed me the most on my first viewing (that and the towering - no put intended - performance by Ian McKellan) - I DID get the feeling I was in a different world, a different time, and I TOO have been missing that in films.  Thank you, Peter.  I am hungrily awaiting the next two."
alisha-hk,"Jun 3, 2022",N/A,"As a person who loves to watch the fantasy genre, Lord of the Rings is a classic movie that has all the right criteria for a great fantasy movie. With enjoying these types of movies I can tell you that Lord of the Rings movies set the bar high for all fantasy movies that came out after 2001 after bring Tolkien's books to life. Even though I have yet to read the books that the movies are based on, the director (Peter Jackson) did a great job telling this epic story while pulling you in the world of wizards and ring bearersThe special effects, props, wardrobe and the New Zealand scenery tied the movie perfectly together. Though this movie is 3 hours long, the times fly by fast as there is always something interesting to see on screen. The actors did great job pretraining their characters and telling the story. I one hundred percent recommend the Lord of The Rings and The Hobbit movies as they are both a great way to escape into a land of magic. Thought note if you have read The Hobbit books the movies are slightly different but still holds the beauty and magic that all great fantasy stories have.Overall the Lord of The Rings is a brilliant movie that will never get old and is definitely a classic movie in the fantasy genre. These movies will always hold a special place with me and it's a movie series that I have to re watch every year."
thol_sabirs,"Apr 9, 2002",1/10,"First of all, to all the people who claim that this movie was a risk to make - WRONG. This film was always going to make it's money back due to the fans of the book. Even the ones who were appalled by the thought of their so called ""masterpiece"" being turned into a movie would have still paid to see it.The LOTR fan base ensured that this was never going to be a box office failure. And it's that same fan base who have propelled FOTR to the top of the IMDB. I have friends who are LOTR fans and they gave it 10 out of 10 before they had even seen it!That type of fanatasism means that this film can only really be fairly judged by people who haven't read the books. And as one of those people I have to say that Peter Jackson blew his chance and LOTR is a glorious failure.For a movie to truly be considered ""great"" or a ""classic"" it has to trandscend it's genre. It has to appeal to all kinds of audiences. The way Star Wars is loved not just by sci-fi fans but fans of every genre from westerns to romantic movies. The way that The Wizard Of Oz is loved by fans of musicals and fans of fairytales. The Fellowship Of The Ring apeals to one group of people and that is the die-hard fan of the book. To the rest of us it's boring, cliched, idiotic, and pointless.It's pointless because there is nothing in this movie that we haven't seen before. It's been done before and better by everyone from Tim Burton to Steven Spielberg. In fact some of the scenes in this movie remined me so much of Burtons Sleepy Hollow that you expect Jonny Depp to appear any second. Jackson rips off everyone and fails to stamp his own style on this story. It's like watching a selection of your favourite scenes from other movies being copied by an amature.There are two real problems with the movie (three if you count Jacksons direction), the first is the plot. We are told within the first half hour what the story is. A group of characters have to take a magic ring to a special place to be destroyed. On the way they will face much danger. THAT'S IT!! You can leave after that because you already know what happens. There are NO twists, there is NO tension, and the character developement in non-existent. Once you are told the plot you have to sit through 2 and a half hours of dodgy effects and poorly directed action sequences until the end. That's if you stay awake.The second major problem is that we don't really care what happens to the characters. The heros aren't likable and the villains aren't scary. None of the characters have any kind of charisma or appeal and there seems to be no point in some of them being there. There are a few jokes thrown in (which aren't funny and make you cringe) and a little hint of romance between some of the characters. But even that feels like it's been thrown in at the last minute by the studio. A perfect example of how boring the characters are is in the way Jackson gives us a big close-up of the ring every 5 minute. Why? Is it to remind us why the character are there? Is it to stop us falling asleep?It doesn't work and neither does the film. 2 out of 10"
EijnarAmadeus,"Nov 19, 2002",10/10,"...that was maybe too much! But, I do got to say: one of the best movies ever made!Elijah Wood is wonderful as Frodo Baggins, the confused, scared but brave little fellow. Then we got this Strider guy, Aragorn. Viggo Mortensen plays him supreme and is probably the movies best character, and we've got Sean Bean as Boromir, Orlando Bloom as Legolas, Liv Tylor as Arwen, Ian MacKellen as Gandalv and we can go on and on.The film music is one of the best I've ever heard! Especially after Gandalv has died - very mood."" Run you fools! "" One ring to rule them all, but Tolkien, you could have dropped all those names: Urun, Mordor, Sauron, Arathorn and I could have said hundreds more! They're simply nothing to me, I don't care who Gimli is the son too! I don't care what flame that comes from Urun! But - enough of that."" Get off the road! "" Nazgul, there we've got the movies little creepy part. Riding horses, wearing these black clothes and armed with long swords. A movie that really touches you. Great! Fantastic! Simply...brilliant.

I am just so amazed with the production, the actors, the directors, every single person that helped bring this production to the worlds eyes! Is Absolutely amazing and should be worshiped lol, even down to the people that brought whoever needed coffee that morning."
kismit,"Jan 11, 2002",10/10,I saw this one in the theatre for the second time which I have not done since the advent of VHS. As a fan of the book my one complaint is there were some very good things left out which I regret will not be seen until the film is remade again in 20 years. There is simply too much material and for those who haven't read the book this is a shame. I don't doubt Jackson could have made the film quite a bit better if he had had the desire and license to take a hatchet to the source material and fashion it into a more conventional screenplay. This really would have involved working some level of closure into FOTR that was was not in the book. Has there ever been another movie made that was so clearly only a third of the whole story? I am really surprised at how many non readers of the book enjoyed the film. This is one movie where people where people who saw the film first will be blown away by the book.
akeightley,"Jan 23, 2002",10/10,"Now I've heard a lot of people saying that this film is nothing more that another ""fantasy"" and once the hype dies down it will only be remembered as a mediocre  ""fantasy"" film.  Well first I'd like to point out that ALL films by definition are FANTASY, unless its is a documentary.  Second, how could this film be called mediocre?  Unless you were under the impression that all films of the same genre were of LoTR quality or better (just watch Harry Potter to see how that is not true), or prehaps you some how managed to mistake Harry Potter for LoTR.Now why, you may ask do I believe that LoTR should be No.1.  Well, in how long has there been a film that can engross people from the ages 6-80+, male & female alike?  Not in a long time I would say.  As it has the special effects & action we now expect in ""blockbuster"" film, but also it has ""heart"".  When I say it heart I mean it has done more than just dazzle you into thinging you have seen a good film, by making the special effects the main star for the film.  In LoTR, while the special effects are amazing to say the least, they don't steal the show from the main characters of the story.  Now other films have this quality, The Godfather & Shawshank Redemption to name a few.  But until now no other film has come as close as LoTR to have a successful marriage of the two.  And there for can appeal to a wider segment of population without the feeling it is playing to the lowest common denominator.Well this is my reason for saying LoTR should be the number 1 film, and if not Fellowship alone then just wait for the complete LoRT trilogy :-) Also this film improves at least X10 on the second viewing."
joiningjt,"Aug 18, 2020",10/10,Cant say anything that hasnt already been said its simple if you haven't seen this work of art you are not only out of touch with the phenomenal world of film but missing a TRUE MASTERPIECE!!

jon.h.ochiai,"Jan 12, 2002",10/10,"Peter Jackson's first installment of the J.R.R. Tolkien, ""Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful work with another outstanding performance from Sir Ian McKellen and a star-making performance from Viggo Mortensen as the Ranger, Strider. I have not read the Tolkien trilogy, though I was read ""The Hobbit"" way back in sixth grade. So I am not familiar with the Tolkien mythology and legacy. From what is presented on screen, screenwriters, Frances Walsh, Phillippa Boyens, and Jackson, have crafted a story of magic, courage, and honor. Peter Jackson gets great performances out of a large and talented cast, manages stunning visuals that never overwhelm the movie, and maintains a coherent narrative style.The narrative at the movie's beginning was necessary for a novice like myself. The One Ring of the Dark Lord Sauron must be destroyed or all will be lost in Middle-earth. The Ring possesses great power and the seductive power of evil. The Ring that has been lost for 2500 years ends up in the hands of Hobbit, Frodo (Elija Wood). The powerful wizard, Gandalf (Ian McKellan) recognizes the Ring for what it is. Frodo's charge is to destroy the Ring. Soon a Fellowship is formed to aid Frodo in his quest. There are Elves, Dwarfs, Hobbits, Orcs, and Humans along the way. The journey is filled both with bravery and betrayal. Gandalf's master, Saruman (Christopher Lee), has aligned himself with Lord Sauron. The Ranger, Strider (Viggo Mortensen), becomes the protector of the brave Frodo. The first hour moves very slow under the weight of the material and set up. The last two hours of the movie move briskly. This is a very stuffed 3 hour movie that does not feel longer than that, or shorter.What makes ""Fellowship of the Rings"" so captivating is it's tale of heroes and great warriors. Elija Wood does an amazing job in the transformation of Frodo. At first Frodo is overwhelmed by the responsibility he undertakes, then he sees that he must do what is right, and he realizes that he is not alone. Wood combines the anxiety and courage magically. Ian McKellan is awesome as Gandalf. As the powerful and aging wizard he is the leader that inspires greatness in others. Viggo Mortensen as Strider/ Aragorn is charismatic, and the soul of the ""Fellowship."" Strider is a great warrior and a true samurai. Strider gives his word to Frodo that he will protect him with his life, and he keeps his word. Mortensen plays Strider as man of few words, backed up by action, compassion, and seemingly haunted by a dark secret. He absolutely commands the screen. Also impressive are Orlando Bloom as Legolas, the Elf archer, and Sean Bean as the warrior Boromir, who battles the seductive power of the Ring. Cate Blanchett also gives a great performance as Galadriel, the muse of this Fellowship. Liv Tyler is beautiful as Arwen, though she does have much of a role in this installment.Peter Jackson's ""Fellowship of the Ring"" is masterful storytelling with great performances from a very talented cast. I look forward to rest of the movies."
Tviktor212,"Jan 7, 2016",10/10,"WHile I was first introduced to the Middle-earth movies through The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, this was the second film from the saga that I watched.While watching it on the extended edition expands the story so much that sometimes it feels a little too extended, it's my second favourite LOTR movie. What made me definitely like it is the way it gets really emotional towards the end. You'll understand that only by watching the film.I'm not a huge fantasy fan, but Tolkien's universe is one I loved, and this is one of the movies that introduced me to the whole world."
marcusedenellis,"Jul 30, 2005",10/10,"If you are reading this review (or indeed any other) trying to assess whether or not you should watch this film then please read no further and just go and slip in the DVD (Extended Version) and let the sights and sounds of Middle Earth wash over you. Nothing I, or indeed anyone else, can say should help you to form an opinion prior to watching. I guess the audience for the three films fall into two distinct categories; those who have read the books and those who have not. Those who have not, in my experience, tend to be overwhelmed by the absolute majesty of the vision but a little non-plussed by the actual story - seeing it as just some rather dopey fantasy; a Star Wars trilogy set in past times for the modern audience if you like. Then there is the ""yes, I have read the books"" class who in general seem to have a kind of smug arrogance grounded in comments such as ""they left out too much"", ""its not what I imagined"" or ""Of course its all an allegory for the rise of the third Reich"".Tolkein bemoaned the lack of an heroic mythology for the English people and he sought to create one in his Rings trilogy of books. My opinion is too humble to count - but if you want it, I believe he succeeded. The epic backdrop, the heroes and villains, the rich history, the races and the languages are all utterly plausible as a long cherished story handed down over many generations. Peter Jackson and his team must be congratulated not only for their wonderful realisation of Middle Eath and its inhabitants; but for crafting a series a movies that captured the very essence of what Tolkein was trying to achieve.Well done also for leaving out Tom Bombadil."
TOT_EchoofGlory,"May 11, 2020",N/A,"Novel to movie adaptation is difficult, the storyline is easy to be disrupted, and the characters will also be affected. Fortunately, The Lord of The Rings adaptation is a great success. The plot is simplified, but the story of the fellowship is still outstanding. Moreover, even by 2020 standards, the special effects are still compelling."

wtheld,"Jan 5, 2003",1/10,"Personally I found this movie to be a major disappointment.Having read the book(s) several times since the mid-sixties, I have a thorough knowledge of the plot and a profound fondness for the texture of the story. I resisted unreasonable expectations going in, and was prepared for what I thought would be, at worst, a visual treat and some interpretative entertainment.What I saw, however, was dour, over-pensive characters with little or no inherent charm, Pippin and Merry tossed in merely for bumbling comic relief, unconnected and confusing plot development (had I not been so familiar with the story I would have been completely unaware of what was going on in the story), and alterations to the storyline that were insipid and done merely to provide larger roles for the actors (the Arwen/Liv Tyler synthetic heroics pop immediately to mind).As if the baffling plot development isn't bad enough, the role of Saruman in the story is greatly misrepresented, texture building subplot roles such as Bombadill and Butterbur were simply removed, and what were the Sacksville Bagginses (so critical to the book plot in the end) doing in this movie if they only got one (rather bewildering) reference. I could go on for hours about missing characterizations but suffice to say the difference between book and movie in this arena is horrific, and in point of fact, fatal.Certainly the 'graphics' were nice, but so what. Amazing graphic hacking and hewing of monsters in a mountainous setting is a dime a dozen these days. Big deal.And, Hugo Weaving as Elrond was ridiculous. All due respects to Mr. Weaving, but all I could hear Elrond saying in any of his scenes was 'Well, Mr. Anderson, one of these lives has a future and the other does not.' Respects to his powerful portrayal as agent Smith.The charm and depth of Tolkien's story is completely missing in this film. Frodo, for example, whines and whimpers through every scene, acting continually pained, as if he had a thorn in his foot the entire time. He has no real inner character or strength, except in a few unfounded grandiose speeches during which he seemingly pulls some nerve out of thin air and proclaims himself equal to whatever task is currently at hand, after first whimpering in the background for a good deal of time with sad puppy-dog eyes and furrowed brow.I would guess that the direction of this film was based on the assumption that members of the audience had read the book(s) and were familiar with the story line (how else could anyone follow the jerky plot presentation). If that is indeed the case, why were there so many drastic deviations from the original story line? Did screenwriter Frances Walsh or director Peter Jackson actually believes themselves better at telling this tale than Tolkien? The difference in medium is simply not a good enough explanation for me, and I rank this convoluted, expensive quagmire of one-dimensional characters and uninspired storytelling right up there with other titanic screen dogs, like Armageddon and Independence Day.Painfully, there are 2 more Lord of the Rings episodes to come."
EirikSS,"Dec 7, 2001",10/10,"I have seen Peter Jackson's vision of Middle-Earth. It is beyond everything I ever wanted it to be. And then some. Having read the books several times, I was hoping for this film to be a candidate to my all time favorites. Now it is.I've been following the production of these movies for a long, long time now. On my computer, I have those storyboard-drawings from long back, that was shown on NZTV. You all know; the one with Gimli, an axe and the other with a hobbit looking scared into the camera. I remember when Miramax wanted to make just two movies. I remember the first geeks seeing Sean Connery in Wellington, instantly screaming `Gandalf spotted in Wellington'. I remember a photo of a constructing-worker digging hobbitholes. I remember when Ian McKellen signed, to much relief. My room is covered with the posters for the movie: Frodo holding the Ring, looking anxiously at us, looking down The Pillars of Argonath towers over my desk. I have a wall covered with photos from the film My room is a Geeks' confessing to his love for Middle-Earth. And yesterday I went there.And OH-MY-GOD! This is one of the best films ever! I do not want to spoil anything for those who haven't read the books, but I promise you; this is one movie you will never forget! The casting is superb, almost to perfect to be true. Ian McKellen, Elijah Wood, Sean Been, Orlando Bloom, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin etc. They are all great!! The effects are stunning and ""invicible"", the editing-costumes-make up-music-EVERYTHING is put together beyond expectations. Look at the clothes Bilbo is wearing, listen to the music after the Balrog has done its' business, watch the editing in the Nazgul-Bree sequence. But above all, the cinematrography is extraordinary. Andrew Lesnie's camera is everywhere and it makes you wonder: ""How the ¤%¤&""#& did they get a camera in that position?"" The directing, the script, the rest of the GOD DAMN stuff is so good! I can't wait to get back in the theatre, to get back to Middle-Earth.I love the last scene, I love when Gandalf rides thru the Shire, I love the Hobbits cocking food in the deep mountains, I love the sound the Nazguls make, I love the first vision (Yes, it is a vision) of Arwen, I love the voice of Galadriel AND I LOVE THIS MOVIE!THANK YOU PETER!!!!Eirik"
vithiet,"Dec 29, 2018",10/10,"I read the book for the first time when I was 10 so I had been waiting for this movie for a very, very long time. With apprehension. But I am glad they waited so long to make it, as the result is an absolute masterpiece that will satisfy even the most hardcore Tolkien fans."
liammurphy1,"Aug 29, 2003",10/10,"I haven't read the books so I wasn't sure what to expect from this movie & having heard it was over three hours long I was a bit sceptical about watching it. But I have to say I was amazed - The acting by all concerned is good to excellent especially from Elliah Wood as Frodo & Ian Mckellen as gandalf, The action was well handled & very exciting, The special effects were great but thankfully they didn't distract from the plot (as in MEN IN BLACK 2) The beautiful New Zealand scenery was a joy to watch, and the 3 hours fly by as long as you are prepared to give it a go as it is quite slow to begin with, With the strong characterization of the first 40 minutes. You may be disapointed to see the film end so suddenly as the story follows through 2 more movies, but you'll be thankful you sat down and watched.A future holiday classica must for all adventure/sci-fi fans10/10 just great from start to finish"

BabelAlexandria,"Jan 11, 2022",10/10,"After viewing in the theaters (early 2000s) and the extended DVD versions (late 2000s), I recently purchased the remastered 4K UHD blu rays with Dolby Atmos, and watched the entire series with my kiddos (7 and 9). It was a fabulous experience, with top-notch picture and sound enhancing the canonical greatness of the story (and the film) itself. It took us about five weeks (December through early January) to watch all three films; in fact, if the extended version is included (and all the extra/extended scenes are high quality, they just needed to limit the length of the theatrical version), the trilogy is basically like a multi-season show of the Netflix (or better, Amazon Prime!) era, which can be enjoyed in 20-30 minute viewings.Sienna's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gandalf, Legolas, and Aragorn; scariest characters: witch king, Mouth of Sauron
Sebastian's favorite characters of the trilogy: Gimli ""because he always complains;"" scariest characters: Nazgul (""much scarier than the animated ones"") and the Balrog."
Agent10,"May 21, 2002",10/10,"Epics aren't easy to make, but Peter Jackson created a masterpiece of a film. This movie will easily detract all of the failed efforts he has engaged in, especially the god-awful The Frighteners. While Star Wars may be considered the superior series and Harry Potter the more popular of the fantasy epics, LOTR's depth and more subtle use of CGI effects proves to be far superior to the saturated blue-screens and matte paintings Star Wars and Harry Potter employ. I never took Elijah Wood seriously as an actor, nor Sean Astin.I was very apprehensive about these two being in this movie, but those fears were quickly alleviated when I witnessed the seemingly natural friendship the two displayed in the movie. Maybe that is why New Line made all of the movies at once. Eventually, friendships had to form in this type of setting, and such ideals would become rather convenient throughout the scope of the story. This is by far a good beginning, and fans of the books (like myself) won't be subjected to inconsistencies and older looking actors considering all of the principal photography is finalized. Which leads to one question. What kind of money would one get having to be the film clerk for this trilogy?"
andzac-89068,"Jul 5, 2022",10/10,Every aspect of this movie from the acting to the soundtrack. This is one of the best movies you can which perfectly adapts Tolkien's work without any political nonsense.
LoneWolfAndCub,"Oct 14, 2005",10/10,"When Peter Jackson took on this amazing trilogy written by J.R.R Tolkien he was taking one of the biggest dares in cinematic history. The Lord of the Rings trilogy has gathered countless fans over the world. The books are captivating masterpieces that delve deep into our imaginations. To think that it would be transferred to the big screen. But Peter Jackson had that certain touch, he turned a great book into a film that will be treasured as one of the greatest films to ever have been made.For those who haven't read the books (I urge you to) the plot focuses on a ring. A ring made for evil. This ring can turn the bearer invisible at will. By luck, this ring lands into the hands of Bilbo Baggins, a hobbit from The Shire. He passes it down to his nephew Frodo Baggins. When Gandalf finds out about this he immediately sends Frodo on a quest to destroy The One Ring. Because if it falls into the wrong hands it could mean an end the Middle Earth. Along with Samwise Gamgee they set off on an epic adventure.This movie is one-of-a-kind. An adaption has never been this good. Everything about this movie is captivating and just so brilliant. I have read the Fellowship just once but I was just so pleased with this movie. The way Peter Jackson has gone from paper-to-film is very inspiring. The look of Middle Earth is extremely beautiful. The beautiful Hobbiton and dread-filled Mordor are just perfect.The roles are perfectly suited. Elijah Wood is great as Frodo, Sean Astin as Samwise was a perfect choice and Ian McKellen as Gandalf was an extremely smart choice. This movie is just perfect and if you haven't seen it I urge now. GO SEE IT!! 5/5."
Kirpianuscus,"Sep 13, 2025",N/A,"One of that adaptations with precious virtue to be more than faithful adaptation of novel but fair remind and reflection of values defining the story. Sure, profound dedication of Peter Jackson to a project with more than significance of honest- precise - touching adaptation of a book write with magnificent precision of detail and reminding the unique flavor of classic fairy tales . An impressive fresco, epic confrontation, eulogy of friendship and seeing it again, a profound admirable Frodo."

dfrank-14887,"Nov 17, 2024",3/10,"Despite graphics and camera work that hold up to this day, Peter Jackson's vision for the Fellowship of the Ring strikes too closely to what Tolkien himself wished to bring to life. Whilst fans of the original books would be delighted at the detail Jackson included in his adaptation, for new fans of the series, and even for fans of fantasy content generally, the Fellowship of the Ring is so densely packed with information and worldbuilding that its expositions will undoubtedly bore a less eager audience.It is no secret that the directors cut is noticeable longer due to the inclusion of additional scenes, but comparing it to the theatrical release really puts this into perspective. Fervent fans of the series will encourage newcomers to endure the directors cut for a variety of reasons, however, one much less spoken about, if hardly mentioned at all, is that for proper context to be established for later events, certain scenes and information must be experienced. However, the theatrical release omits some such scenes. Whether it be due to time constraints or poor scene selection this is an issue that persists throughout the trilogy. As a consequence, some characters characterization suffers immensely and reduces what would otherwise be a layered, multifaceted character to an easily digestible villain or hero."
frodolives,"Jul 4, 2002",10/10,"From the casting to the acting, from the cinematography to the special effects, from the locations to the sets and props an costumes and makeup, from the wonderful film score to the truly excellent screenplay, there is hardly a fault to find with this breathtaking, amazing piece of cinematographic art. Director Peter Jackson and his superb, highly motivated cast and crew have done the seemingly impossible in turning Tolkien's beloved books into a movie, and they have done it so amazingly well - finding their own idiosyncratic interpretations while staying absolutely true to the spirit of the book - that all I can say is: Go and see it!! - if you haven't done so yet."
Boba_Fett1138,"Jun 28, 2003",9/10,"Beautiful environments with lovely costumes combined with superb characters and and an intense story...the result: The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring.Don't let the 3 hour + running time scare you of, like so many long movies it's very well worth seeing. Never has a fantasy world looked so realistic as in Lord of the Rings. All the sets are very detailed and have a realistic feeling as well as the characters and the different races of Middle Earth.The greatest strength of this movie is not the story itself. The story itself is actually pretty simple, basically it's just about the Ring and the quest to destroy it. No, the greatest strength are the characters, the look of Middle Earth and the action sequences. Rarely has an adventure movie looked so good and has been so tense and enjoyable to watch.But let's not over praise it, the movie has it flaws and weak spots. There are some unnecessary and boring scene's (especially in the Extended Edition) but for an 3 hour + movie that's maybe just unavoidable. And no matter how awesome everything looks, the special effects aren't always top-class, I'm a firm believer that the movie would have been better if ILM provided the special effects. But let's not judge the movie for what it could have been but let's judge it for what it is. Also, sometimes the Hobbits (Sam, Pippin and Merry) are border line irritating. Another thing that disturbed me was the editing, in my opinion it was extremely bad done in some of the scene's (For instance in the wizards battle between Gandalf and Saruman) but having some editing experience myself I might pay extra attention to this things...But in this case all those flaws and weak spots are forgiven, for The Fellowship of the Ring truly is a wonderful movie that you simply must have seen at least once in your life.Already a classic!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 21, 2005",10/10,"A pop culture phenomenon, ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is unlike anything that you've ever seen. The plot of course has several hobbits and humans joining up in Middle Earth to destroy a ring that corrupts whomever possesses it; in the process, they have to fight off evil beings. The movie is beyond impressive. In fact, there isn't any adjective that can do it justice. You have to see it to believe it. Peter Jackson adapted J.R.R. Tolkien's novel to the screen as a work of art that would otherwise be unfathomable. I've never read the novel, but I can say that Elijah Wood, Ian McKellen, Viggo Mortensen, Sean Astin, John Rhys-Davies, Liv Tyler, Cate Blanchett, Christopher Lee, and Ian Holm, interpret the characters with a style and quality that we usually associate only with history's most distinguished actors and actresses. This is THE movie to see, and parts 2 and 3 were equally good. A masterpiece in the true sense of the word."

BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Jun 5, 2004",10/10,"I was so happy when I saw this. It is proof that Hollywood can spend huge budgets and not always produce bad movies! They need to hire a director who's not from Hollywood, but they can still do it!This is a great adaptation of the first book of the LOTR trilogy with not too much deviation. The cinematography and sets are particularly amazing. They truly capture Tolkien's rich language and vivid detail from the book. All the lush visuals are beautifully rendered in what is one of the few good uses of extensive CGI.The non-CGI elements like the costumes and music are also breathtaking. The people who worked on this worked their butts off many times and they deserve all the praise they have gotten and will surely receive for the rest of their careers in film. 10/10"

thousandisland,"Mar 4, 2002",6/10,"Granted, I did end up behind a big, tall blue-haired guy when I saw this in the theater, so all the subtitles were hidden behind his big, tall blue-haired guy-shoulders, but I did catch 99% of this movie and I feel I'm qualified to review it.  It has great acting but the story is sort of incomplete and hard to follow in spots, and not in the ""ooh I can't wait for the next one."" sorta way.   It seems to depend TOO much on its sequel, at the expense of allowing ANY kind of closure.  There is a very sharp cut in this film which divides the first part (All About running from Ringwraiths.) From the second part. (All About running from Orcs.)  It occurs on the riverbank before the Elf forest, and is followed by a dream sequence and a lot of choppity chop editing  that confuses the reality considerably.  It turns out that the dream sequence isn't a dream at all, though it had me and half my party fooled.   That sequence is totally awful and stands out as utter confusion amid a story that is pretty smooth otherwise, though there are a few parts that just leave you up the creek.   It doesn't help at all that the characters themselves are incapable of reflecting on what happens to them.. Not once  does Frodo look around and muse, ""What do you suppose happened to all those Ringwraiths we were running from earlier?  Strider said they could never die, and would never stop chasing me, but they just seem to have disappeared.  I'm not even worried about them anymore..  Why is that?"" ) There is altogether too much ""acceptance"" of what is happening, and not enough questioning or curiosity on the part of our heroes, curiosity which would really help the viewers understand things better.  The characters are given almost no depth at all, and people respond to this with, ""Well, it's not the whole story.  They're going to explain everything in the other movies later.""  So this completely liberates this film from the burden of traditional necessities like character development and plot explanation?  Okay fine, but that made it all the more difficult to really get involved and be interested in The Fellowship of the Ring..  Yes, beautiful effects, great costumes and makeup and  atmosphere, but not quite enough substance.   All the acting is superb, especially Elijah Wood's performance, and there is even some sex appeal (Nevermind Strider..Legolas is where it's at.) And that grand sense of ""Epic"" you would expect... but this one just didn't do it for me.   Not worthy of its publicity and popularity, Fellowship is being carried by the literature and lacks its own identity.  All in all, it's just a mediocre movie."
DeborahPainter855,"Aug 18, 2011",2/10,"I tried to like this movie, I really tried, but the early scenes with the hobbits were dull and clichéd. Nothing interested me. The fireworks scene was trite. I have seen thousands of films, and so I feel I have the ability to evaluate a film based not on who directed it but how well it is paced, the quality of the film score and how the characters engage the viewer. This one was lacking in almost all departments save the special effects. The big battle between the two wizards during the first hour did nothing for me or my sister, who sat down to watch the DVD with me. We both got bored and turned the movie off after an hour. She read all the Lord of the Rings novels in college and told me that the film departed too much from the novels. I read The Hobbit when I was in high school and liked it. But I won't be bothering with any other Lord of the Rings films from Peter Jackson."

However, after I started getting into A Song of Ice and Fire, I decided to watch the movies since the franchise played as inspirations to the series. So I started binge watching the trilogy with my sister, who was a fan of the series before I was.Needless to say, I'm definitely going to read the books when I'm done with the trilogy because after watching this film, i definitely want to become a big fan. This has one of the most compelling beginnings to a whole major story.

Gibson-H,"Jun 16, 2022",10/10,"""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" is directed by Peter Jackson.It stars Elijah Wood, Viggo Mortensen, Ian McKellen, Orlando Bloom, Sean Astin and Christopher Lee.The first part in this great trilogy follows a hobbit named ""Frodo"" and companions who are tasked with destroying the one ring which could bring chaos and destruction to ""Middle Earth"".""The Lord of the rings"" trilogy is for me the greatest trilogy ever made. I could watch these films any day.The positivesThe films premise and story is fantastic. The film is near enough three hours of setup but it also does a great job in captivating you to watch the next films. Every character has distinct personalities along with great motivations and starter development. The romances and friendships all feel real thanks to all the actors having great chemistry along with great performances. ""Ian McKellen"" is for me perfect casting. No one else can play ""Gandalf"" In my eyes. The action in this film is fantastic. Not only are the stakes high in them but they are shot brilliantly. The whole film is shot fantastically. There's so many unique shots in the film that are memorable. The character design and makeup are all flawless. The ""Orc"" makeup is so good that I sometimes forget the people playing them are actors as they look so real. The CGI is fantastic even to today's standards. Finally the film also manages to be really scary. The film is full of creatures that won't hesitate to kill. When the characters are in danger I still get chills because of how scary those scenes are.The negativesThe only minor flaw is that a couple of action scenes just last a bit too long especially the staircase scene. But all the action is entertaining and full of tension.ConclusionFor me, ""Fellowship of the ring"" is one of the best first acts to a trilogy ever made. With its interesting story and characters, incredible chemistry and acting from the actors, brilliant camerawork, thrilling action, state of the art CGI, great makeup and some genuine scary scenes make this film almost perfect.I'm going to give ""The Lord of the Rings: The fellowship of the ring"" a:10/10."
gemma15,"Feb 12, 2002",10/10,"I'm not sure that there are words to describe what I thought of this film, but I'll have a go.  Everything about it was amazing - the landscapes, the script, the effects (and they don't normally concern me too much), the music (can you wear out a CD?!).  But what really got to me was the emotion emanating from this film - whereas most films get into your head, this one got into my heart (corny, I know, but true).  The reason for this?  The acting.  A film may have all of the above listed things, but if the actors aren't right then you'll never accept the film.  Every single character was perfectly portrayed, including Arwen and Galadriel (who a lot of people didn't seem to like).  In fact, I think extending Arwen's role was a change for the better - at least in FOTR (I'm reserving judgement on her role in the next two installments).  I must make special mention of four actors though.  Firstly, Elijah Wood.  A perfect combination of vulnerability and determination, and those eyes - I could just drown in them!  Secondly, Sean Bean.  Boromir was always one of my favourite characters, but I truly sympathised with the character in the film.  Thirdly, Ian McKellan - he is Gandalf, what more can I say?  And finally, Viggo Mortensen.  His performance just blew me away.  Apart from being gorgeous (!) I loved the way he portrayed Aragorn's fear that he wouldn't be good enough to be King. And boy, can he swing a sword!In summary, go and see this film.  I've seen it five times, and I'm not stopping there.  Simply the best film of all time."

tjmack-68240,"Oct 31, 2024",N/A,"After only ever getting through half of it previously, I finally watched the full movie through. It was a great glimpse into a deep world of fairy tale lore. I appreciate that typically it isn't just magic saving the day, and the characters all have strong archetypes that shine in interesting ways at times. Though we don't learn terribly much about most of them, outside of their archetypes. Having seen and enjoyed The Hobbit in theaters, many years ago and without seeing these, it was really exciting to see the connection between Bilbo and Frodo. The cinematography is epic as well, and instills feeling of a deeper world and story at play here. It really does feel like they're so close, though I know there are many many more hours of film left. I am excited for the next in the series."
neurodw,"Dec 8, 2002",7/10,"Sorry, but I can't say this is the wonder everyone claims it to be.  Not only is the richness of character in the books missing (it's replaced with lovely visuals, granted) but much of the mystery and feeling is gone. Instead there's action and affectation.  No nuance and subtlety.And why couldn't they stay truer to the books?  Sigh."
Holly_OHara,"Feb 10, 2005",2/10,"... and so the film appears to continue in the same vein, repeating this pattern every half an hour or so.I am a pretty patient person - I don't need loads of action or constant surprises to keep me on the edge of my seat. However, I do appreciate a semblance of a storyline. I am told by friends that the reason I didn't enjoy this film was because i haven't read the book, but to me, this is simply not good enough as an explanation. Yes, we all know that this film is an adaptation of a famous book, but shouldn't the aim of the director then be to draw in new fans, as well as bring the book to life for those who have read the book??I was so disappointed with this - I don't buy into hype, but I did expect a good bit of escapism with this film. Unfortunately, as already mentioned, I failed to find anything that could retain my attention. And, from a person who gets irritated if people so much as sneeze during films: I began a conversation with the person sitting next to me halfway through the film and continued to do so sporadically, whilst simultaneously checking the timer on the DVD player, wondering when my own ordeal would come to an end...I honestly cannot remember how this ends, so no chance of spoilers from me - suffice to say, it doesn't matter in my case, as I have no plans to watch the sequels."
TheLastStop41,"Feb 12, 2002",10/10,"I know it's my second time writing a review on Lord of the Rings, but this isn't it particularly about Lord of the Rings. As some of you have read my last review (it was only posted yesterday, so the chances you did read it) you could tell just by my one line summary that I loved the movie. This year's academy competition for my guess will be Lord of the Rings vs. A Beautiful Mind.  One of the nominees for both movies, which most of you know, is the best director award. Though I have not seen A Beautiful Mind, I would like to say that Peter Jackson should win for two main reasons. 1. He's a director that has not done a lot of movies and he has just created a masterpiece. And 2. Since he's a director who hasn't done many movies, it's very hard to make a movie that's going to be nominated for best picture which he has accomplished, but it's even harder for a a rookie director to make a masterpiece that is based on a book. Yeah Ron Howard is real good director, but many people aren't capable of making a masterpiece movie based on a masterpiece book trilogy. I know there's nothing any of you people can do about it, but I just felt that Peter Jackson is the one who I think truly deserves Best Director."
liranlotker,"Dec 11, 2001",10/10,"Okay, the moment has come. I've re-read the whole LOTR trilogy once again as a preparation for the movie, memorized all the characters and watched the Peter Jackson interview again just to remind myself that no matter how good the director is, the movie version can never reflect the depth, complexity and magic of the original book.Still, expectations were extremely high as I stepped into Monte Casinos' Premier theatre for the special premier (simultaneously  presented with the Premier taking place in London). Even before that, every time I went to the movies and the FOTR preview came on my skin began to crawl, the ""One Ring"" speech given there just made me want to jump out of chair and scream ""SHOW IT TO ME NOW!"". Now that the screening is over I can tell you one thing. While it is not an exact representation of the book (and nobody can really expect it to be, because even when they try, the result will be something as unimaginative as the Harry Potter movie..), but it does create the incredible magic and atmosphere of it. The characters are amazingly built, the plot is presented with flawless clarity and the story is done in such a way that you simply cannot imagine how it could have been done any better.Visual effects, dialogues, acting and music are all combined to create a true master-piece. Not only was I not disappointed, I cannot wait until I go to watch it again (or for X-Mas 2002, for the The Two Towers premier..). If I could, I would give this movie 11 out of 10, since 10 is the maximum, it'll have to suffice.."

The whole trilogy is great, but almost nothing out there is as breathtaking as the first of Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings trilogy. Returning to it as an adult, it really is shocking how incredible this is from start to finish. Despite its length I maintain, to this day, that it is never boring and constantly arresting. Achingly beautiful, occasionally funny, the definition of epic, Fellowship of the Ring has it all. Oh, and that soundtrack? Need I say more? 10/10, a timeless masterpiece."
macgsmcom,"Mar 9, 2022",9/10,"J. R. R Tolkein's books are wonderful, with memorable characters, an enchanting atmosphere, strong narrative and dialogue and an epic story. Peter Jackson's trilogy mayn't be necessarily true to them, but it does have the memorable characters, the epic story and enchanting atmosphere that the books do. The Fellowship of the Ring is probably the weakest of the three, but it is a very solid start. It is I agree slower in pace to the other two, and there are some talky scenes that drag it down a tad."
mhasheider,"Feb 10, 2003",10/10,"A wonder to behold and not to be taken for granted, the first chapter of J.R.R. Tolkien's ""The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring"" is an electrifying eye candy feast, courtsey of director Peter Jackson and writers.The story itself isn't too hard to understand as a hobbit, Frodo Baggins (Elijah Wood) inherits a mysterious ring from a close relative, Bilbo (Ian Holm) and unfortunately finds out who it belonged to before. So Frodo is forced to take the ring back to where it came from and he's helped from a wide (and unlikely assortment) of allies who become known as ""the Fellowship"".Besides the story, another element of the movie made me enjoy even more is the cast, which has to be one of the best ones ever assembled in several decades. Among the other key characters are Gandalf (Ian McKellan), a wizard: two humans, Aragorn (Viggo Mortenson) and Boromir (Sean Bean): Legolas (Orlando Bloom), a wise elf with excellent marksmanship: Gimili (John Rhys-Davies), an axe-wielding dwarf with a grudge: and three other hobbits (Sean Astin, Billy Boyd, and Dominic Monhagan) who make up the ""Fellowship"". There's some other familiar faces that appear here (Liv Tyler, Hugo Weaving, Cate Blanchett, and Christopher Lee) who each play a key role here.Overall, the movie is bound to be a classic even though it moves at a leisurely pace and gives the viewer time to understand the characters more especially Frodo, Gandalf, and Aragorn - each of whom seem to be bothered by something in their past.One last thing, since I haven't seen ""A Beautiful Mind"" yet I'm sure this movie truly deserved ""Best Picture"" and I say it not insult the die hard fans of the series."

Goataid,"Dec 20, 2001",1/10,"Ok, so forget all the hype and think about it for a second.  3 hours in which nothing much happens except a bit of walking and then a bit of fighting does not a good film make. There may be those who are fans of the book and I don't doubt that to them this is a great film. But to anyone else who have never ventured into the world of Tolkien then it is a huge let down.  There seems to be too much reliance on knowledge from the book as none of the characters seem to have any back story and we haven't got a clue to why they are prepared to take on the quest.The action scenes are few and far between and when they do come they seem a bit lacklustre. The acting is nothing special and there are some scenes (The council meeting) where the effects people must have taken the day off. Which leaves the walking... there's a lot of it. In fact they're some of the best bits as New Zealand looks very nice. However that's all that gets done and after a while I was convinced that the film was going to show and advert for Millets or the Rambling association at the end.

KaiaJadeR,"Jun 10, 2022",8/10,"""The Lord of the Rings"", is an exceptionally complicated story. There are countless species, places and languages presented throughout this movie- yet, miraculously I found it easy to follow and super entertaining.This film is a prime example of fantasy done right. It not only captures a highly loved story but contains every element that makes a fantasy movie so fascinating. There's beautifully crafted sets, a unique and recognizable soundtrack and realistic proportions and costumes for each character.My favourite aspect of film is production design, so I might be biased...but I think the sets are what make this movie so magical. The fantasy prevalent in the sets is what allows ""The Lord of the Rings"" to be so easy to follow and enjoy. Although the movie includes so many details and information, I could rely on the sets, the colour and the style to provide insight on what was happening and where the characters were.Another artistic element that helped develop the story was the soundtrack. The music was well suited to each scene, and helped capture the emotions the characters experienced. The music included a lot of unique instruments, and had a great otherworldly sound.An aspect of this film I found very impressive was the costume and character design. I loved how different each character appeared physically. Their outfits not only gave me an idea of their background, but also their role in the story.Overall I found ""The Lord of the Rings"" very entertaining. It's an amazing example of what every fantasy film should accomplish."
Movies8586,"Mar 5, 2002",10/10,"LOTR is unlike anything I have ever seen before! It captures just about every emotion that you could want in a film: wonder, love, humor, terror, adventure, drama, etc.! This is truly one of the most awe-inspiring movies ever made! The cinematography is sweeping, the storyline is beautifully constructed, and the acting is flawless! There is no weak link in this cast! Ian McKellen fills the role of Gandalf like no other actor has ever filled a role. He IS Gandalf! The rest of the cast deserve special recognition as well.Much credit to Peter Jackson, JRR Tolkien, and the rest of the production company for making this miracle of a movie possible!"
ma-cortes,"Dec 14, 2022",9/10,"Awesome , extraordinary picture with gorgeous frames and groundbreaking special effects. This is first part in Jackson's trilogy based on the novels written by the classic writer J. R. R Tolkien . This over-the-top film begins with Frodo (Elijah Wood) who inherits a mysterious ring from his uncle Bilbo (Ian Holm) , as he must leave his home in order to keep it from falling into hands of his evil creator . Along the way , a fellowship is formed : Gandalf (Ian McKellen) , Frodo (Elijah Wood), Pippin (Billy Boyd) , Sam (Sean Astin) , Merry (Dominic Monaghan) , Aragorn (Viggo Mortensen) , Boromir (Sean Bean) , Legolas (Orlando Jones) , and Gimli (John Rhys Davies) to protect the ringbearer and make sure its final destination : Mt. Doom , the only place where it can be destroyed . The valiant group cares the Ring to transport it to Mt. Doom across risked and extremely perilous paths pursued by astonishing dark forces . Meantime , Gondor is invaded by the Orcs of Mordor and Aragorn falls in love for Arwen (Liv Tyler) . Later on , they travel to the creepy caves inhabited by the Army of the Dead and a spectral being . All of them suffering a lot of dangers , while fighting Saruman's (Christopher Lee) army of Orcs and Gollum/Smeagol (Andy Serkis) following/abetting and continuing the travel towards Mount Doom to destroy the powerful ring . One Ring and save Middle-earth from the Dark Lord Sauron . Even the smallest person can change the course of the future ! . Middle Earth comes alive...! All we have to decide is what to do with the time that we are given !. Power can be held in the smallest of things... One ring to rule them all, One ring to find them, One ring to bring them all and in the darkness bind them ! Its power corrupts all who desire it. Only one has the will to resist it. A Fellowship of nine must destroy it !. A New Power Is Rising !. The Battle for Middle-earth Begins! All will be sacrificed... All will be lost... Unless all unite against evil !.This sensational epic adventure is plenty of action , impressive battles , spectacular drama , plot twists , gorgeous exteriors from New Zealand and being pretty entertaining , in spite of about three hours runtime , while still managing to keep a quick enough pace for those unfamilar with the lengthy literary work . The movie packs a real sense of wonder and stimulating action set pieces illuminating the full-blown feats of the various protagonists and winding up in overlong battles and a stunning finale to be continued by two top-notch sequels . It contains incredible array of technical visual effects by Weta Digital and Weta Workship , among others companies . Sensational and colorful cinematography by cameraman Andrew Lesnie and long-standing as well as sensitive musical score by Howard Shore , winning deservedly Academy Award . Beautifully realized set design with phenomenal production values and lavishly produced by Harvey and Bob Weinstein . The film provides amusement enough during the three and half hour and stays closer to the novel than any of the former adaptations -mostly animated and in low budget- such as the mediocre effort by Ralph Baski . The motion picture will appeal to Tolkien followers as the neophyte who didn't have seen the subsequent parts . Stunning direction by Peter Jackson bringing competently the fantastic world and mythology of the great British author to life . Followed by ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers¨ (2002) and ¨The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King¨ (2003) , all of them magnificently directed by Peter Jackson ."
duane.galle,"Mar 25, 2002",10/10,"Peter Jackson's mammoth task of recreating JRR Tolkein's classic epic ""Lord of the Rings"" has been done masterfully. I have read the books over 50 times, and I have always found in the past that movies rarely satisfy my imagination when based on books that I have read.This is different. The characters, locations, scenery and music is all portrayed just as I had pictured them in my mind (with the exception of Boromir - I always thought of him as more Viking-like). On top of this the special effects are spectacular, but they serve only to enhance, rather than overpower, the story. There were sections of the story that were glossed over or removed, but thankfully little was changed. By my recollection, there were only two scenes that were dramatically different to the book - Frodo escaping the Ring Wraiths over the river, and Frodo farewelling Aragon. However, the reason behind these changes was clear, and really I can't see any other way to keep the movie as short as possible.Although LOTR is a long movie (almost 3 hours), it is never boring and keeps the viewer enthralled. As well, the narrative at the beginning of the movie does an excellent job of bringing any non-readers of the book up to speed.In case you hadn't guessed - I loved the movie, and I can't wait until the next 2 are released. One word of warning - this is no kid's movie - it is not Harry Potter or Star Wars, and parents that expect their pre-teens to be able to watch this without nightmares should expect to be proven wrong."
SMLA11,"May 21, 2002",10/10,"I absolutely love this movie!  This movie has really awesome action and very great special effects.  The acting was way too good.  Ian McKellan should have won for best supporting actor, not that Tom Wilkinson was bad but I really enjoyed his performance.  I haven't yet read the book but I hear it's as good as the movie.Overall I enjoyed this movie from beginning to end.  This is probably the only long movie that I can see again and again.  rating 10 out of 10."
doubleofive,"Jan 12, 2002",10/10,"Alright, listen: I'll admit, I'm a Star Wars geek.I saw ""Phantom Menace"" 4 times in theaters and own the DVD and all the Special Edition VHSs.  But then I saw ""Fellowship of the Rings"" on opening day.  And it seems all that changed.  Star Wars will always have a special place in my heart, but this ONE MOVIE beats them all.As I said, it's hard for me to say this...But having not read the books and not even knowing much of the basic plot, I went into this movie with open eyes.  And I was totally blown away.  I figured LOTR was kid-friendly, with cute little hobbits and dwarves and such.  But the movie was so DARK!  It's a tale of temptation, of power, of emotion.  Not a corny ""Harry Potter"" (which I saw only for the Episode 2 trailer), but something that pulls at the heartstrings and makes you think. Not only is the plot excellent, but the special effects and acting are extraordinary.  I still don't fully understand how they made the hobbits so short (but that will be answered on the DVD, i bet), and I could only find a few obviously bad effects (Frodo in the Council of Elrond).  There is only one word to describe the battle sequences: INTENSE.  It's just so fast and I don't know how they didn't hurt anybody.  I've seen the movie three times and the ending still gets to me.I don't know.  It may be my age (I just turned 18), it may be the changed world, but Star Wars seems a little childish.  Don't get me wrong, I'm still excited about ""Attack of the Clones"", but not in the same sence, nor with the anticipation I have for ""The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers."""
hawkeye_pierce2,"Jul 19, 2002",10/10,"...but gave it a 10 because the stunning visuals (and I don't just mean ""FX"" I mean actual retinal intake at the utter aesthetic level) made up for the tiny bit of creeping out I got from looking directly into Elijah Wood's face all movie (not kidding). Short of that, I am almost excited and giddy such a new movie has climbed to #4 all time (on IMDb at least) but frankly it earned it. Any movie almost as good as Rain Man (but in polar-opposite ways) deserves to be #4...(I too loved Godfather and especially The Shawshank Redemption, but Rain Man is arguably the greatest film ever for many, vastly different reasons). I digress, no one should miss Lord of the Rings and I'm just glad I caught it at the Blue Ridge in Raleigh 8mos after it premiered (seeing this for the 1st time on video/at home would have been my loss)."
phibbus,"Jul 16, 2006",N/A,"Peter Jackson couldn't pace a story to save his life. Everything which makes the book a timeless treasure is completely thrown over in favor moronic ""improvements"" aimed at a perceived demographic. The only saving grace of the film is the art direction, but even that leans far too much toward the most recent calendar-illustrators of Tolkien's work (Alan Lee, John Howe, etc.), and lends a slick, sci-fi look that the author would no doubt have found distasteful. The subtlety of the story, with just the right bits of information revealed at just the right times, is rejected in favor of a blunt-force approach which gives away everything at the outset in order to showcase some more lousy cgi at the earliest possible moment. The Ralph Bakshi cartoon, while also far from successful as an adaptation, is far superior by comparison. The other two films Jackson's travesty only get worse."
grankin,"Jan 10, 2002",7/10,"this was one of the best films that I have seen in the last couple of years. having read the hobbit, and over a period of years read the trilogy of the lord of the rings. not in my case an easy book to read but worth the effort. I was amazed at the way the film mirrored my thoughts on all the characters and scenes. definitely not an easy job considering the power of our imagination. special mention to the actors and special effects brill.............  have no hesitation in recommending this movie. maybe a bit much for the under 12's to sit through."
Ripe Peach,"Jan 3, 2002",1/10,"Peter Jackson \ C/O WETA Productions \ New ZealandDear Peter,I write to you care of your special effects studio, as that seems to be where you spent most of your time during the production of this 3 hour technical demonstration.I would like to congratulate you on producing a proof of concept that demonstrates that you now have the technology to make a great adaptation of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"", and I would be keen to know when you intend to do so.While your proof of concept was nearly technically flawless (not many people will have noticed Legolas drawing CGI arrows straight through - and not out of - his quiver), I am sure that you realise that this is only a necessary prerequisite to actually producing a dramatic and enjoyable film. Clearly, your cast realised that they were just doing a dress rehearsal, as they delivered unengaging and one dimensional performances.  Unfortunately, Liv Tyler and Sean Bean seemed to be labouring under the mistaken belief that they were actually filming the real movie; it was rather cruel of you not to let them into the secret.  Boromir's line of ""And they have a cave troll."" contained a full TWO nuances (sardonic, resolute) and sounded as though an actual person had spoken it, which jarred badly with the idiot-board delivery in the rest of the tech demo.It was an interesting choice to show half of most of the plot lines (as opposed to most of half of them), so that the test audiences could get a taste of what to expect in the final version.  For example, showing Sam saying goodbye to Bill the pony, without explaining where he came from, or setting up Gimli's antipathy to elves without then allowing him his one piece of character development, his adoration of Galadriel.  Of course, no one who has actually read the books will be satisfied with this token coverage of the facets that make the book so enjoyable, and I trust you will resolve this in the release version.When you do film the final version, I would suggest that you obtain both an action choreographer, and a decent sound recordist.  It is clear that you had neither for this technical demo, as the action sequences jump cut once or twice a second, usually away from imminent snafu's, and the entire film is drowned out by the yammering and cliched soundtrack (Enya! How capricious!), a clear sign that you had no decent original to edit. Apparently you will have $90 million to spend on the final version, and you will only have to cut perhaps ten seconds of CGI to be able to invest in some actual cinematics (I suggest the pointless Indiana Jones scene that serves the sole purpose of setting up a poor ""joke"").  On the issue of investment, I notice that your tech demo cameras can only focus at under twelve inches, or over fifty yards.  Perhaps buying some cameras that can perform mid range shots might be an idea.Once again, congratulations on showcasing WETA, and good luck when you actually decide to make your long awaited adaptation of ""The Fellowship of the Ring"".Yours most very sincerely,Ripe Peach"
LadyHawke41386,"Mar 5, 2002",10/10,"The incredible story that began with nothing more than a ring, and led to a fellowship sworn to destroy it before it destroys them, comes to life with Peter Jackson's The Fellowship of the Ring.I have been a huge fan of Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings ever since I first read the books, and when I heard that the trilogy was being turned into movies, I wasn't sure whether to be excited or disappointed.  Most movies tend to bastardize the books they are based on, so I went to the theater in December prepared for a bit of a disappointment.  To my surprise, I found it to be excellent.I happen to be one of those people that, when reading a book like Lord of the Rings, can in my mind's eye picture every little detail as I trace the paths traveled by the characters, from how many clouds are in the sunset sky to the linden trees by the narrow road to the hoofprints left in the dirt by a cantering horse.  So I had my own sets already pictured when I entered the theater, and I grimaced at the thought of what they might have used for the movie.  But the sets were almost exactly how I had imagined my own to be, from the dark, almost Gothic streets of Bree, to the ethereal, elaborate elvish worlds of Rivendell and Lothlorien, and the towering immensity of Isengard.  Almost unbelievable that this was all filmed in only one country.When I first looked over the names of the cast, the only ones I recognized enough to put a face to were Liv Tyler, Christopher Lee, Elijah Wood, and Hugo Weaving (though it was a little strange to see Weaving without his earpiece from The Matrix).  The rest were unfamiliar to me at the time. But I think that having any bigger names, like Braveheart's Mel Gibson or Die Hard's Bruce Willis, would have detracted from the characters that these actors portrayed-when I think of those movies, the first thing that pops into my mind is who is in them, not the stories or the characters or anything else that should be what makes a movie good.  But the acting by the cast in Fellowship was superb nonetheless.  Elijah Wood's honest, innocent, young features contrast sharply to the ruddier appearance of the other hobbits, and his portrayal of the nobly courageous Frodo is so believable and convincing that the hobbit comes far more to life than I had expected him to in the movie.  Liv Tyler brings with her the courage touched with femininity that the books were seriously short of, replacing an elf by the name of Glorfindel who has no other part in the books; this I believe to be a good choice since it gives a beginning to the romance between Arwen and Aragorn that the book only explains in the appendices.  Cate Blanchett's performance as Galadriel was as ethereal as I had hoped it would be, and having her explain some of the history of the ring at the beginning of the movie really set the scene.  Viggo Mortenson fit Strider/Aragorn incredibly well, and he brought the rugged nobility and royal gallantry of his character to life.  The ever-so-loyal-to-the-end Sam Gamgee-my favorite character in the books-is played to bumbling perfection by Sean Astin. Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd give a comic edge to their characters, Merry and Pippin, that really portrays the laid-back, almost child-like personality of true hobbits.  John Rhys-Davies makes an excellent dwarf in his gruff bravado, and the talented Orlando Bloom looks so natural shooting his bow and arrows in that machine-gun style you would expect of an elf. Sean Bean plays the valorous but struggling part of Boromir extremely well, portraying very believably the torture of one who has held the ring but knows he cannot have it.  Christopher Lee commands respect as Saruman, the sage wizard who has been led astray by the deception of the ring.  And as for Ian McKellan's performance, there is nothing to say-he, as the great wizard Gandalf, is magnificent beyond words in his role.But even a movie as stunningly well-done as this cannot be completely without fault.  Not only did they leave out the verse about the original rings, but they also cut out Strider's verse (All that is gold does not glitter,/Not all those who wander are lost;/The old that is strong does not wither,/Deep roots are not reached by the frost./From the ashes a fire shall be woken,/A light from shadows shall spring;/Renewed shall be blade that was broken,/The crownless again shall be king.).  And then there were (although a minor detail when compared to the rest of the movie) the elven-cloaks from Lothlorien.  These I had pictured in my mind as something slightly more elaborate than made of fleece-type-flannel-looking material.  And also, they never once referred to the Balrog as 'Durin's Bane' as they did in the book.But for each of the few things cut that should not have been, there were a score of things done right.  The Balrog was impressive for not having much of a physical description in the books to go on, Orthanc was intimidating, and the Uruk-hai invoked the fear that they were meant to.  This movie kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole three hours and five minutes (both the first time I saw it and the second) as it was shown to me that even today, great movies can still be found, one without the objectionable material that movies get attention for today, one that places emphasis on loyalty and friendship and sacrifice.  It was breath-taking; it was stunning; it was magnificent.  It was Tolkien's The Lord of the Rings and awesome in its greatness.This is one movie that definitely deserves a thirteen-and-a-half out of ten in my book."
rhinds,"Oct 16, 2014",10/10,"There are few movies that make you want to turn around and walk right back into the theatre after you have seen it for the first time. For me, this was one of them.I don't know if it was the story, the music, the amazing visuals, or just the timeless sense of adventure I got, but I was hooked on LotR immediately. And that was before I even read the books! Peter Jackson pulled off a masterpiece. The highlight of his career.Do yourself a favor if you haven't seen it: find the biggest TV you can, an extended-editing Blu-Ray, some surround sound speakers, and shut off the rest of the world (including your phone!) and enjoy THIS world for a while!"
William Gull,"Dec 10, 2001",10/10,"I just came from the screening of The Fellowship Of The Ring, and by God, it´s just about the most awsome thing I have ever seen. The casting is impeccable, the special effects raised the bar considerably from what has been seen previously and Howard Shore´s music is genious. All this would mean absolutely nothing, if the story wasn´t so spectacular and rousing, and Peter Jackson´s directing not so awe-inspiring. Well, it is, and the whole audience was captivated for the three hour journey. I would like to take this opportunity and urge everyone to take your loved ones and go see this movie, everyone deserves it. God smiled the day Peter Jackson was born."
franckynoelma,"Sep 7, 2013",10/10,"I think this film is one of the best film of all time along withe God Father. If you haven't seen you gotta go see it now. Believe me you'll love it. I became a Filmmaker today because of this film. The cinematography is great. I've such a great deal of filmmaking by this film. I remember the time I saw this, I was in Middle school at that time. Tis film is great for fans of fantasy, action, triller, and horror. What amaze me the most was the set decorating, everything was life like. The make for the creature were amazingly done. Bringing this fantasy to life was a monumental task for the filmmaker. One of my favorite character of this was Smeagal. the way he acts and move was well done and matches his character."
empress11,"Mar 15, 2002",10/10,"Nothing compares to the greatest film of all, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring. As I watched my favorite books come to life before my eyes I was positively engrossed in this movie.To start off, the scenery must be of the most beautiful places in the world. New Zealand was the perfect place to film it and from the grassy fields to the high mountain tops, each shot was capturing and very believable. The Shire was exactly how I imagined it, with the rolling fields to the hobbits holes, with their round doors at a perfect height for the little hobbits. Rivendell was the most stunning scene out of them all, as perfect as a picture, with misty waterfalls, sparkling streams and the careful structure of the buildings and towers.The beginning told well of how the great rings came to be and Cate Blanchett has a very powerful and capturing voice. The characters all played their parts well. Elijah Wood was more than perfect and adorable in his roll of Frodo Baggins. Ian Mckellen did an outstanding job in his roll of Gandalf the Grey. One of the best characters has to be Strider/Aragorn played by Viggo Mortensen. The scene between Aragorn and Arwin was one of the most beautiful. Liv Tyler gave a great performance in her role although I do not think that Arwin was a big enough roll to be credited third. But I guess they have to intertwine women into the picture. In the movie, the two most enjoyable characters were Pippin (Billy Boyd) and Merry (Dominic Monaghan). They  were quite funny as the good natured hobbits, always ready for their next breakfast. And there is no friend quite like Sam (Sean Austin). Comments about Frodo and Sam being gay are silly thoughts because its nice to see that two guys can give each others hugs with out being homosexual. Saramaun (Christopher Lee) quite frightened me at first but after reading about the actor who played him and his life,I would love to meet him. Especially since he has meet J.R.R. Tolkien. The orcs, quite yucky, but very believable and very evil. I love Gimli (John Rhys Davis) with his axe and I must admit that Legolas (Orlando Bloom) who is very quick with his bow and arrow is also very attractive. Boromier (Sean Bean) although was very tempted, in the end proved to be worthy of his master.The last thing I must comment on is the directing. Peter Jackson could have done no better. Every shot caught your eye and the graphics that went along with it made it all the while better. Also, the sound track for this movie better win its Oscar because the music is beautiful especially the Enya songs. All in all, this being the greatest movie, derived from the greatest books, I cannot wait to see how they have captured the second two books."
Doylenf,"Sep 21, 2002",N/A,"THE LORD OF THE RINGS has its admirers who are familiar with the plot and the strange characters inhabiting it--and who genuinely love the book and were eager to see their favorite story on the big screen.In this case, it helps if you are familiar with the plot and the characters because the screenplay is a murky one with none of the characters given enough time for us to understand what they are all about. Instead, we move from set piece to set piece (grand, beautiful sets abetted by dazzling visual effects) and in between each new grand view locale there's another battle of good vs. evil with weapons clashing in every direction and limbs lopped off as fierce battles ensue.It's a sort of dungeons and dragons world and if this is your thing then this is your dark movie adventure. I saw this on video rather than the big screen so I can assure you it probably all looks a lot grander on the theater screen with the deafening stereo sound effects adding to the vigor of the story. But none of the characters really stand out amid all this swordplay and skullduggery.Only Ian McKellen and Elijah Wood have substantial enough parts to connect a viewer to the movie. The others are all backgrounders without becoming characters we care about--with the exception, perhaps, of Christopher Lee as Saruman the White, who always makes a convincing villain. Another problem is the sound--voices are dropped so often that much of the stilted dialogue is muted. This is a special drawback because several of the actors have some sort of accent. The worst offender happens to be Ian McKellen who nevertheless gives a very compelling performance behind his grizzly make-up--however, someone should have dubbed some of his lines for greater clarity. The likeable Elijah Wood relies on his specialty--wide-eyed wonder or tense concern for close-ups, but it's rather a one-note performance.All in all, I was disappointed. With all of the hype (and due to some of the comments expressed here) I expected a much more substantial story than this, especially for a movie with a running time of almost three hours. The drawback on video is that many of the special effects are pretty obvious and the big screen grandeur is lost even when viewed on a large TV screen.A bit of a letdown in every department. Even the score only occasionally has the right mystical quality between battles. The battles are not quite as brutal as those in GLADIATOR but their intensity is just as great and they turn up with alarming frequency!"
octavian-6,"Mar 18, 2002",6/10,"i really cant understand this whole ring-lord-hype. Ok, it was a nice kids-movie, but not more. And the Tolkien books are not more than kids-books. If i was 12 then i would also think that it was the best movie ever, but hey, i'm not 12! And if this movie gets the Oscar (the important one), then this will be the most overrated movie-oscar since Titanic.6/10 nice adventure movie. if you like that, then youll like ""The Goonies"" too"
wetzel,"Jul 1, 2002",10/10,"When I first learned that this movie was being made I unconciously conjured images of the horrid Lord of the Rings made in the '70's.There were so many things that could have gone wrong with a movie of this magnitude, but to my great pleasure none of them did. Peter Jackson and company did an extraordinary job of bringing this incredible book to life.The sheer amount of detail is astonishing. Nothing since Star Wars has created such an amazing fantasy world. But none of this would matter if the acting wasn't executed to perfection. Every actor fits their role to perfectly.I only have a couple of complaints. The romance between Aragorn and Arwen was only briefly touched and seemed a little forced. We're only given a couple lines of dialogue about the impact of their relationship but nothing that shows why Arwen should want to give up her immortality. I can only hope that this will be fleshed out in the sequels. I was also a little disappointed to see so much of Lothlorien cut out of the movie. We don't get to see any of Gimli's affection towards Galadriel or the gift-giving scene and much more that occured there.But these are very minor complaints. As long as you aren't a die hard fan who will be mortally offended by the changes from the book to movie or just plain against anything fantastical in nature, then you should thoroughly enjoy this movie. I give it 10/10."
vip_ebriega,"May 25, 2008",10/10,"My Take: Grand-scale epics at best.After plagued with much hype and anticipations upon release, THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING, the first of three adaptations of J.R.R. Tolkien's classic book series, is a highly satisfying and intriguing trip to a dark and yet magical new enterprise. New Zealand-born director Peter Jackson, like most of Hollywood's directors and producers, demand a great deal of money to create such project, but unlike others, Jackson has his own vision. He doesn't let the film blunder with too much special effects without first seeing what's more important, plot characters and storyline. With such great framework, it's no wonder why FELLOWSHIP is steady and strong.Firstly, the movie is filled with dazzling special effects. There are dozens of flashy advances on the effects. Now, we are able to create towers, civilizations, creatures, caverns, and many other locale and characters in grand scale. It's a convincing look at a terrific combination of miniatures, digital effects and the like. This is a grand motion picture achievement, and it's great to look at. This cost a lot to be sure, and it shows.But the movie isn't all flash and dazzle, it's also about characters and a story, and it doesn't water down Tolkien. His vision of Middle-Earth is wonderfully and respectfully visioned by Jackson, who takes his imagination to create it. The characters that populate the story are actually valuable. Frodo (Elijah Wood) and his gang of Hobbits, and the rest of the Fellowship, comprise a surprising amount of friendship. These characters are a real fellowship, as we care about them, and what happens to them. The plot isn't tailor-made for Tolkien fanatics alone. The plot is easily explained and punctuated, and avoids much confusion.Although the adaptations of the follow-ups are more superior, it only shows that something great can actually be something even bigger. THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE RING is superb, epic-scale, with heart.Rating: ***** out of 5."

And as i read i never took the story in but once i saw the movie i have become more involved then ever. I have seen the film 3 times and plan to see it again and buy it when it comes out. I check the websites each day and download videos and evrything. Elijah Wood, Sean Astin, Billy Boyd and Dominic Monaghan as the hobbits were by far my favourite characters, they are all talented and amazing in their owns way and brought the four hobbits to life. Viggo Mortensen as Aragorn was perfect and he played the part wonderfully. The rest of the cast were great too and Peter Jackson should be proud. Every thing that happens for this film and cast they deserve. I can't wait to see the next two films."
daredevil_81,"May 17, 2002",10/10,"After seeing LOR, I was completely amazed by how Peter Jackson did absolutely amazing adaptation of the first novel. The acting was top notch, the special effects where used as a tool for the film, not the film was the tool for the special effects. It goes to show that good filmmakers are still around. Lucas should of watch LOR before he made Episode 2 (or before making Episode 3) and take notes on what real film making is all about, what if Peter Jackson directing Star Wars Episode 3? If he did it would have save the Star Wars Saga, and rescue it from the unbearable cheese of first 2 pre-quels. Besides the best Star Wars episode i.e. Empire Strikes back', wasn't made by Lucas but studio master Irvin Kershner. It goes to show that the Star Wars medium is brilliant, but with wrong directing it can be pure crap. And the LOR medium is equally awesome to Star Wars, but thank heavens that LOR had a good director. even though LOR books was one of the influences for Lucas to create the Star Wars saga anyway. Besides I shouldn't have compared LOR and Star Wars, but it was a natural Instinct to do so of the two Epic tales of good against evil. Peter Jackson doesn't care about world class box office sells, he cares about world class film making and that feeling is present within the film, thus making LOR refreshing to see.P.S. I know I will get criticised for what I said, I dont care."
todd2u,"Dec 23, 2001",10/10,"This was such a great movie. The whole time it took my breath away. Everything about it was great. This is the best fantasy adventure movie ever made in my opinion. I loved everything about it. The acting was great, the music was great and the direction was great. I dont know whatto say about this movie. I love fantasy movies. I love this movie. The scenery were awesome. Watch this movie! I've never read the book but I do know you'll love this movie. I recommend this movie to anyone and everyone. I was never disappointed at this movie. You wont be either."
TheNorris,"Dec 21, 2001",1/10,"Well I went to this film not know what to expect so I had an open mind. I left about 2 hours into the film because it was so slow and mind numbly dull.I can appreciate that for a film to incorporate a massive novel it needs a long time to set the film so that people can get into it, however it starts off dull and never goes above mildy interesting. It is a slow film, I knew that from the beginning, however Apocolypse now was a slow film but that was never boring or tedious.The acting is dire, apart from Sir Ian McKellen who is alway a pleasure to watch. But I cannot feel that I was watching a Playstation computer game with nicely drawn people.All I know is that you will not see me at the next two films for no amount of money or wealth offered.Matt Norris"
davidgor,"Mar 29, 2002",10/10,"Among thousands of movies I watched as an avid cinema-goer, ""The Lord of The Rings - Fellowship of The Ring"" has a most unique and separate place.The movie is vivid (did not notice how I spent the 3.5 hours), exciting (jumped off the armchair more than a few times), very much impressive (awesome battle sequences and intriguing dialogues) and a real treat to the eye (could any body show me another movie that could photograph so many landscapes at such breathtaking beauty?).I suggest strongly to all those who have read the masterpiece and also to those who have not, to go and be deeply impressed by the wonders this movie has to offer.And to those who watched and rated it with a vote lower than '6', I have but one suggestion; Please, oh please do something about your unrelenting tastelessness and try to eradicate your prejudice about films that deliver so much more than tacky (and suffacatingly boring) action and/or drama scenes..."
Destiny-1-12-15,"Mar 15, 2022",10/10,"J. R. Tolkien's lure of fantasy is portrayed Masterfully by Peter Jackson's grand picture of Tolkien's art of imagination that is The Lord of The Rings. Far beyond the text of books, the diving information, wonders of storytelling in pages. Peter Jackson's scope of film taken out of pages and put on the big screen, is an adaptation like films has never seen before!From the rolling hills of the shire, to the beauty of waters, to the raging horrors of Mordor. The Fellowship of the ring is beyond the words of Masterpiece, but a grand/cinematic beauty unfolding for 3 hours of non stop adventures. Like an art museum come to the adaptation of film. Peter Jackson's scope of middle Earth is a dream come true, with a grand lineup of characters from Frodo, Sam, Gandalf, Bilbo, Aragon, Legolas, Sauraman and more! From top to bottom. Fellowship of the ring has a fantastic cast! And becoming one of the greatest fantasy films ever! Since Star Wars!From the rolling hills/beauty hills of the shire, to the fellowship of the ring and an unexpected adventure lead by hobbits and company. The Fellowship of The Ring is a beautiful triumph! A wonderful Masterpiece!"
Vartiainen,"Jan 12, 2019",10/10,"A lot has been said about The Fellowship of the Ring over the years. It was a cultural phenomenon unlike few others at its release. People talked about it for years before it even came out. There was a lot of hype, a lot of buzz. And it earned it. This movie changed cinema. It paved way for a whole plethora of fantasy movies. It's quite likely that the current superhero craze would not have happened had this movie not shown that people cared about make-belief, care about escapism into a foreign and strange world, filled with magic and wonder.It truly is a wonderful movie. There will doubtlessly be other adaptations of J. R. R. Tolkien's magnum opus in the years to come. We can only hope that whoever they end getting to direct, will love the world of Middle-Earth as much as Peter Jackson does.Because that's why these movies are so good, why this movie won us over almost instantly. It's not the huge budget, or the talented actors, or even the majestic landscapes of New Zealand. Although they do help. A lot. But in the end it's the hours put in. All the tiniest details that someone included, not because they absolutely had to, but because they wanted to make it as perfect as possible. Because they care about this world, about this story.The Lord of the Rings has now shaped multiple generations. It has shaped how we think about stories. It's definitely one of my favourite books ever written and this one is definitely one of my favourite movies ever made. Not because it's the perfect adaptation. Or the perfect movie. It's neither. There are things changed, which I wish were not. The storytelling has its hiccups. But those don't matter. Because at its heart this movie is in the right. It cares about what it is, what it represents. About what it's telling us. What kind of a story it is.And it is for that reason that I love this movie so much."
gila_film,"Dec 15, 2002",10/10,"LOTR:Fellowship Of The Ring is definitely a master in film history. I never saw a film that's so perfect. There's nothing wrong with this film. Drama, horror, action, epic and adventure in just one film, can you imagine that? The best film ever made! I don't know what else to say. I just want to worship this film, and I hope all the two LOTR films can be great like this.10/10"
Drop_Musician_Producer_Writer,"May 25, 2025",10/10,"Not just a Movie, but the Door to another Dimension
The first part of the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the Fellowship of the Rings opened the door to a whole new world for me. I'd never read any of Tolkien's books when I saw the film for the first time at the theatre and, now that I've read them, in retrospect I think being a neophyte to the mythology made my LOTR movie experience all the more miraculous.I loved The Two Towers and Return of the King almost as much as FOTR, but not quite, because seeing Fellowship for the first time was like taking a journey to a fabulous new place and meeting incredible new friends that you don't want to leave. I've never felt anything quite like what this epic evoked in me. It was akin to being a child again, with that tireless sense of wonder and enjoyment of each and every moment, maybe because as a child you are discovering your surroundings, and whatever age you are, when you watch the Fellowship of the Ring you are rendered in awe upon being introduced to the purity and beauty of Middle Earth and darkly enthralled by the majesty of Eisengard, Saruman, Sauron and all of their mighty malice. One of the things that makes this movie so special (and there are so many!) is that you fall in love not only with the ""good"" characters, but also with the ""evil"" ones. For example, Christopher Lee was amazing as Saruman, and I can't imagine the movie without him.Some films that might be comparable to the Lord of the Rings trilogy are: The Fifth Element, the Star Wars Trilogy parts IV, V and VI (forget the newer prequels), the Matrix trilogy (especially the first part), Interview with a Vampire, the Legend of Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp), Logan's Run and The Island. They are all excellent movies and works of art that weave that movie magic that keeps you spellbound and entranced for the duration of their runtime.But after seeing The Fellowship of the Ring, I knew I had found the movie by which I would judge all other movies. Based on J. R. R. Tolkien's beloved books, Peter Jackson has set a new standard in the industry of cinema, one that I honestly think has not and won't be surpassed, at least not in my lifetime, not even by PJ himself.It is truly an instant classic that will stand the test of time and be loved by generations to come. God Bless Tolkien and Jackson and everyone involved in the conception and making of this film, for creating a world that is at my fingertips, only takes the touch of a button to go to whenever I want, and makes me forget everything else.The LOTR Trilogy is undoubtedly MY precious, the non plus ultra of all movies!"
jakebigelow,"Jun 7, 2022",10/10,This movie was a labor of love by the filmmakers. The details that were painstakingly added take this movie and elevate it. The practical effects and techniques used in the production make this a timeless journey that actually holds its own with the books.
Chrissie,"Sep 7, 2002",10/10,"I'm a naturally contrary creature, so I didn't want to go see LOTR simply because everybody else seemed to be seeing it. My daughter persuaded me, telling me she'd buy my ticket and promising me ""lots of eye candy.""Well, blessings on my daughter's head. LOTR was a breathtaking delight (and not just when Aragorn threw his hood back and my hormones gave me a jolt that drew an ""Oh, my!"" from my lips). When the end credits started to roll, I whimpered, ""What? No more?""I'm just hoping they'll do a theatrical re-release before TTT opens in December. There are friends who missed this in the theater and I'd love to share it with them in all its majestic scope."
jacobjohntaylor1,"Jul 20, 2014",10/10,This is a great movie. It has great acting. A great story line. Great special effects. Great visual effects. Great movie. The Hobbit movies are better. But still this is a great movie. See it. It is a most see. Great movie great movie great movie. See it see it see it see it see it. It is long but it will not feel long. Because it is so fast pas. You will not notes the time going by. It is such a great movie. It is so awesome. See it. It has a lot of action. It is very scary. Peter Jackson is a great director. I hoped after this movie more people in my home country of Canada would appreciate fantasy films more. There only do if it is Tolkien s.t.i.y.l. Most people in this country care more about hockey and bad comedies and reality TV.
Azeaka-1,"May 13, 2006",N/A,"This was the first Lord of the Rings movie I saw. It's awful. It's dull, tedious and boring. Worse than Star Wars movies, really, and they're pretty bad. I tried to get interested in it but it was just one gimmick after another to delay the story line: another monster, demon, dwarf, elf, wizard, etc., etc. I guess the final analyis there isn't much of a story line at all. It's sort of like ""The Wizard of Oz"" on steroids but with none of the charm, and it's way too long. The scenery is nice and the special effects are good, but that's all. In the end I didn't care about the characters or how the movie ended. And then, to top it all off, the movie didn't even have an ending. It just stopped with the characters still short of their mission. What a waste of movie-making!"
kirbysta,"Jan 28, 2002",6/10,"I have heard so many things about this movie it is unbelievable.  I have seen this movie twice, read the books, and I can say for sure that it is not the 2nd best movie of all time.  It is also ridiculous that this movie won the AFI best picture of the year against ten other briliant spectacular movies.The first time I saw the movie everyone in my group was half and half on the opinion of weather they liked the movie.  Some people thought it was dreadfull and were upset with me for making them see a 3 hour movie that they thought was ""stupid.""  Others thought the movie was wonderfull but no one thought it was the best movie of the year.  I thought the movie was average but when other people wanted to see it I thought I would give it a second chance.The second time I saw it was a different experience.  I liked the first half of the movie better but I thought the battle scenes towards the end were ridiculous.  The acting was average but some of those ""1-liners"" were stabbing me in the heart.  For instance, ""Let's hunt some Ork"" was my vote for the most ridiculous line in the movie.I thought the special effects in the movie were amazing but the music and the acting were average.  My favorite character was probably Frodo Bagins or Gandalf.  I thought the movie relied on too much action which the book did not.  Some people I heard said they were bored by the dialogue.  That was my favorite part (besides the ring wraiths) in the whole film.In short I do suggest you see this movie.  Some of you will probably hate it, and some of you will probably like it, but none of you I doubt will worship this movie...even if you've read the books."
drqshadow-reviews,"Jun 12, 2013",10/10,"Fellowship of the Ring, Peter Jackson's first swing at J.R.R. Tolkien's daunting mutli-volume masterwork, lands flush on the chin of fans and casuals alike. It's a gorgeous example of just how well a literary adaptation can perform with the right mix of passion, budget, vision and expertise. Jackson's direction, though quite long-winded, seems fat free and balanced with a good sense of when to press forward and when to admire its surroundings. The acting is a relatively broad mix - while Ian McKellen resides comfortably in the quasi-leading role of Gandalf the Grey and Viggo Mortensen is both gallant and inspiring as Aragorn, I found Elijah Wood just a bit too doe-eyed as the ring-bearing hobbit, Frodo. That's nit-picking at its finest though, admittedly, especially given the scene-stealing part played by the realm of Middle Earth itself. Staggeringly realized with an obsessive attention to detail, it's a stern flex of the artistic muscle unlike anything I've seen, before or after. Watching the film today, in the shadow of The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey, is doubly rewarding, as dozens of throwbacks to the events of that film are planted like seedlings throughout the landscape. For my money, this is the best plot of the three LotR volumes, to boot. With one foot planted firmly on the ground and the other teasing the abyss, it covers a gamut of emotions, isn't bashful about shedding important cast members, and gives its audience a sweeping taste of the many colors and flavors present in this world. A wonderful fantasy-adventure hybrid, spiced with action at all the right moments, that does its mythical source material (and the legion of associated fans) proud."
Starbuck-13,"Dec 21, 2001",10/10,"Breathtaking!Pete Jackson did it! This movie is so extraordinary that it is hard to describe with words alone. It is thrilling, frightening, spine-chilling and exciting from the first moment on.This was the most intense movie experience since I went to see ""Return of the Jedi"" in 1983, then being a 11-year old boy. ""The fellowship"" simply blew me away, drove me to the edge of my seat more than once. My girl-friend was totally exhausted, saying that she felt like she herself would have walked with the fellowship over the mountains and through the mines - and the last half hour, she only wanted to say ""stop, I cannot walk any further, I'm totally worn out!!!"". For me, knowing the book, the film still was physically strenuous, but I just could not stop adoring the wonderful pictures and the sensational cinematography.Everybody will have his favorite moments in this movie. Mine were the escape from the black riders in the first part and Boromirs fate in the second. No spoilers here, but Sean Bean was fantastic! And I had to calm down my girl-friend during the Troll sequences at Moria - and many more times during the spectacular end...I am very glad that the movie, unlike many others, more than lived up to the hype.Those hours were among the most exciting movie hours I ever had, and I can't wait to see the next two parts. Hard to wait til Christmas 2002!!!"
r96sk,"Feb 16, 2021",10/10,"Magnificent! A great start to the franchise.'The Lord of the Rings' is yet another film series that I am incredibly late to viewing, at least I've finally got around to it... albeit almost twenty years on from this film's release.'The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring' is delightful. I never know what to expect from a film that goes on for nearly three hours, the pacing has to be near perfection for it to work - and boy does it here. The run time flew by, which is always a terrific sign.I love a load of things about this, the one that actually sticks out most is the outstanding score. Music can play a huge part in how much I enjoy a film, so I'm delighted to say that the score is here is fantastic. That is by no means the only positive, obviously.The cast are excellent. Elijah Wood gives a strong performance in the lead role. I've seen Wood in others things down the years and have actually found him a bit hit-and-miss, but here he is very good. Elsewhere, I really enjoyed watching Viggo Mortensen's character.Away from those two, there are a whole host of noteworthy cast members. Orlando Bloom, or Will Turner to me, is involved, as are the likes of Ian McKellen and Sean Bean. I also liked Liv Tyler in her role.The look of the film is spectacular, and has aged extremely well even to this day. Everything from the cinematography to the costumes is brilliant, those two things really make the film come alive - helped by the aforementioned score, of course.Very eager to check out the sequels, prequels and, eventually, the upcoming television series."
meydiana-65242,"Jul 7, 2022",10/10,"The Fellowship of the Ring is one of those films that comes once in a lifetime, how fortunate we are as human beings to be around at a time where 3 of these films are released within 3 short years!!The fellowship is just the perfect blend of setting the story, fleshing out characters and introducing us to the world of middle earth!Ian McKellen as Gandalf is just legendary.... mysterious, loveable, occasionally hilarious and in THAT iconic scene, completely immortalised.Elijah wood, Sean Astin, Dominic Monaghan and Billy Boyd showcase perfectly not only their playful naivety and innocence but a good heart along with their fierce will and courage to do whatever it takes.Sean Bean does what he does best in most films but has never upset as more in this case and whilst doing so shows us both the best and worst qualities of humans in the harsh, hostile but magical world of Middle earth.By the end of the film you're dying to see what happens next and at every turn you get both attention to detail and storytelling that is seldom found elsewhere.If you haven't watched the Fellowship of the Ring yet, I beg of you! Do it!! It's the first film of a trilogy that is so close to perfection that it will only be seen once in a lifetime 🏅"
fh147,"Nov 11, 2023",10/10,"One of my all time favorite movies as a kid and it still holds up today.I watched a special edition with all the extra scenes and it makes it a whole experience that doesn't feel like any of the characters is left out to dry you get all the good character interaction and boromir a gets the scene. He needs to be a likable sad Guy.The visuals are still amazing, It looks so good. There are some scenes where they use 3D puppets and character for a meme guy in the minds that I ice couldn't not look at but all the other things look amazing and the painting they used in the background and special effects and many sneaky ways they used the camera as to make the hobbits look smaller than they are. Actors amazing job they made this story with is a bit hokey and cringe sometimes but they sell it it never feels cringe it feels so honest and believable despite. How old fashioned fantasy it is.I have watched this movie a lot of times and I still tear up at some points, I still get emotional and if I still do that that means that the movie still has a lot of value and sentimental abilities and honest and wholesome and friendly bromance between every character is what I need."
seanhimmelberg,"Feb 4, 2022",10/10,"I saw these films when I was 7, 8, & 9 respectively. An impressionable age to be sure, but my life was nevertheless changed forever.It holds true that my favorite films are often the ones that effectively put the viewer inside the world that the filmmakers have built, and from the ground up these films exceed this. The landscape, the sets, the costumes... every bit of praise these films have received is deserved. The CGI is to date some of the best I've ever seen and is--thank god--free of the oversaturation guilty of the trilogy's prequels. And if that wasn't enough, Howard Shore completes the journey with one of the most perfect scores in all of cinema.I could talk for days about this trilogy, but in the end it would only amount to the pointless musings of a fanboy. Suffice it to say I believe these are the greast films ever made. And for the record, Return of the King may be the crowning achievement of the trilogy, but The Fellowship of the Ring will always have my heart."

richsh,"Dec 25, 2001",N/A,"When I saw that this movie had instantly achieved the 'number one movie of all time' ranking on the Internet Movie Database, I rushed to see it.While the movie is beautifully made, it is NOT the best movie of all time. It's too long and is really nothing more than a group of characters going from point A to point B while having to survive attacks from various creatures along with having to deal with various environmental elements. I found nothing really compelling about the plot. I found myself glancing at my wrist watch on more than one occasion.I believe that the near perfect score this film achieved on the IMDB was a result of all the role playing geeks who saw this movie during the opening week and gave it a ""10"".  I'd say that it is truly more of a 7.5 - 8.0."
