Twinsen61,"Jan 19, 2004",9/10,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments"". He certainly uses visceral scenes to create very strong emotion  in the movie - the blood running from Mathilda's nose or Stansfield's unforgettable ""EVERYONE!"" are just a couple of examples. The music and the sound are excellent and are used in a masterly fashion - you can hear Fatman's heart beating desperately or a low claustrophobic sound when Stansfield turns to look at Mathilda's father.However Leon does not work only on this primary level, it also has an intelligent story. It may seem to be almost a fairy-tale, but don't be fooled -  just like his character Besson is serious. This movie has a message: without love we are dead, even if we don't see it. Only true love give meaning to our lives: ""everything else reminds me a big yogurt: warm and rancid"" as Mathilda says in the original script, which is available on the net under the name Leon Version 1. Is this true in ""real life""? I don't know but this movie can make you wonder.Then of course there's the sensuality. It's hypocritical to deny it, the camera interacts with Mathilda in a mesmerising fashion. It's not sick and it's not degrading: it's art, subtle and beautiful.Leon is not perfect but it has so many great moments that all its flaws can be forgiven. It's a movie that really should not be missed, unless you are concerned with its amorality. And don't be - Leon is less violent than many action movies and the unusual relationship between the main characters is handled mostly with genuine feeling and tact."
ConkerBFD91,"Feb 18, 2008",9/10,"Many movies have characters in them who are hired assassins, or ""hit men"". They're the standard ""badass"" character that kills people in order to collect a reward. Most hit men in films have been portrayed as cold, heartless villains (Boba Fett of Star Wars, Vincent of Collateral). Léon, however, flips this cliché on its end, as the hit-man is the kind-hearted protagonist who learns how to love, thanks to a little girl who shows up on his doorstep.Léon begins in a restaurant, with the assassin himself (Jean Reno) taking a contract from his boss Tony (Danny Aiello) to kill a man who's moving in on Tony's territory. The next 10 minutes become an enthralling cat and mouse game where Leon shows the viewers just why he is known as the cleaner: he is extremely good at this job. We also see Leon's human side, shown by his passion for milk, his affection for his plant (whom he calls his best friend) and when he becomes engrossed watching Singin' in the Rain. Leon seems quite content with this life, not seeming to want anything more. That is, until he is forced to take custody of a twelve-year-old girl (Natalie Portman) whose entire family was cruelly massacred by a corrupt DEA agent (Gary Oldman). This is where Leon is forced to change his lifestyle for the little girl, and when she wishes to get into contract killing to avenge her brother, Leon becomes her mentor and protector.Luc Besson was both the director and screenwriter for Léon, and he proves with his sophomore effort that he is no one-hit wonder. Léon is a very fast paced movie, chronicling Leon's training of Mathilda, Mathilda's growing affection for contract killing (and for Leon himself), and the final standoff with Norman Stansfield. Despite all this, Léon also has time to throw in some slower scenes that develop Leon's and Mathilda's characters, expanding on their growing relationship and partnership.Jean Reno does a very good job as Leon, portraying him both as an effective and frightening killing machine, and as a loving and caring father figure. There is almost a childlike innocence to Leon, with him being unable to read and not familiar with most American culture. Reno allows the audience to both sympathize with this character and respect him, an extremely challenging feat.Natalie Portman's breakout role as Mathilda is one of the greatest acted child roles in a film, period. Portman is able to portray childlike innocence combined with an above average intelligence and awareness of the world around her. Although she is young, she becomes extremely interested in Leon and his job, wanting revenge for the gross acts committed upon her. Make no mistake, Mathilda is the true star of this film, and Portman completely shines in the role.In comparison to Jean Reno's fairly subdued performance as Leon, apparently Luc Besson wanted a more exciting and over-the-top antagonist for the film: enter Gary Oldman. Gary Oldman completely overacts his character of the crooked DEA cop, and he does it so wonderfully that he steals every scene he is in. This is without a doubt the greatest performance of this underrated actor's career, as the fun Oldman has with this role practically oozes out of the screen and infects anyone who watches him. While some critics criticized Oldman for his performance, it was actually spot on considering that the character of Stansfield is a drug-addicted psychotic cop who has no problem with murdering an innocent family to get what he desires. The only nitpick I have with Stansfield is his screen time is fairly small compared with Leon and Mathilda; nevertheless he completely steals the show when he does appear.The plot of Léon is fairly straightforward compared to most action flicks, as there are no particular plot twists or double crossings. However, the simple plot works because this is not a plot driven movie, it is a character driven one. That's not to say there is no action in this movie, there are a few great action sequences (especially the spectacular police shootout in the film's climax), but the film mainly revolves around the growing affection between Leon and Mathilda, and how they change each others' lives. Overall, Léon is an extremely well-made action/drama, and one of the best films of 1994."
Fella_shibby,"Sep 24, 2021",9/10,"I first saw this in the late 90s. Then again in the mid 2k on a dvd i own.Revisited the remastered extended version last night with my family.This movie is more than just a hitman or an assassin movie.The music is top notch, the characters are very well developed, the action scenes n direction are stylish.But the best part are the scenes between Reno n Portman. Leon is amazingly n very differently portrayed by Reno.There is a Bollywood copy known as Bichoo (Scorpio).The only thing good in the Bollywood movie is that the guy who played Tony gives away all of the hitman's money to the girl whereas in the original, the character of Tony gives only a single currency note to Mathilda n keeps blabbing the same ""safer than the usual bank story""."
Methos-7,"May 16, 1999",10/10,"Luc Besson's movie Léon (The Professional) gives us an intense story which is maximized in potential by the casting of the movie done by Todd Thaler.  Every aspect of the movie delivers to the audience and makes an impressive overall package.  Jean Reno plays a character named  Léon who has learned to repress his emotions in order to perform his job as a ""cleaner"", or hit-man.  His secluded world is shattered by the young girl named Mathilda who lives on the same floor as he does in an apartment building. When she turns to him for help, he learns about living a normal life, even if the circumstances which unite them are far from normal.The performance delivered by then twelve-year old Natalie Portman as Mathilda is nothing short of brilliant.  Her ability to relate to others with body movement and facial gestures is matched by few, she really brings raw emotion and believability to a difficult role.  Mathilda and Léon are unexpectedly thrown together, but learn to value life from their chance encounter, and how valuable a friendship can be.Jean Reno as Léon gives us a solemn and calculated character who sets all of his energy on his assignments until her is given something else to care about.  Mathilda gives him the daughter that he never had, while Léon serves as a father and friend to her.  Gary Oldman, as the corrupt DEA Agent Norman Stansfield, offers the viewers an amazingly wired and electrical performance which pushes the envelope.  He moves the story along by his actions.  Oldman offers us a memorable portrait of a sadistically obsessed man who stops short of nothing to get what he wants.The Professional is what movie-making is all about.  Without the overuse of special effects, a large shooting location, or a commercially star studded cast, we are given all that could possibly be asked for in a movie.  Portman, Oldman, and Reno, along with Danny Aiello as the hit-contractor Tony remind us that there is no substitute for great acting. There are elements of comedy, drama, and action, and great original music by Eric Serra adds to the energy the film already encapsulates.  The most impressive thing about the movie is its story which is basic but is maximized by all the other elements which go into the making of the movie. Simply put, an intense and impressive movie."
jcapelli,"Jul 16, 2002",10/10,"This movie is rated 63 on the imdb top 250 movie list, showing that people obviously like this movie, and with good reason. But why the hell didn;t this movie garner at least one single oscar or golden globe nomination??natalie portman's performance was terrific as the emotionally ravaged matildha - best actress nomination for sure.jean reno should have been nominated for a best actor nomination. the fact that the audience is led to feel sympathy and sorrow for a hitman speaks words enough about his performance.gary oldman is fantastic as the corrupt and psychotic cop. his character is so repulsive and chilling, but at the same time so quirky and interesting to watch. best supporting actor nomination.luc besson. when this man will get some kudos for his work i never know. the professional, in my opinion, is his greatest achievement as a director and, considering the fact he has helmed classic cult films such as nikita and the fifth element, the professional must rate highly as one of the best films of the 90's atleast! best film and best director nominations should have been given.but no, it was all too easy to heap praise on the feel good movie forrest gump, and shun the movie that, through its intensity and tragedy, better highlights the value of life and love."
Gjay2,"Apr 25, 2003",7/10,"luc besson will never top this movie. This is his benchmark, his classical composition. Look at the precise, intricate scenes. It's a symphony in cinema. Straight off, it's action. Intelligently shot, and scripted. It makes everything that follows hard to live upto. But it does so easily. It's stylish without being showy, it's deep without being sentimental. And it's just hugely enjoyable. Seeing the friendship between newly orphaned mathilda and skilled assasin leon bloom, is tenderly done. At risk of slipping into a sappy bond, besson keeps it easy on the emotions, without coming off as shallow.The actors are all spot on, most notably the debut from a young natalie portman as mathilda. Showing an angry, sad, pent up, in love girl is no simple task but she breezes through it, touching all the right notes. And jean reno as the title character, is minimal but very effecting. Hard to understand, but easy to relate too. But gary oldman steals it, with his glorious overacting. He's as scary as he is determind. His line delivery is almost perfect. And his fate is very fitting. If only they made more intelligent action movies, then they could contend with this film. But as it stands right now, leon is one of the best action dramas ever made."
rustysettler,"Jan 4, 2005",10/10,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."
Red-Barracuda,"Apr 20, 2018",6/10,"When her family are slaughtered by a corrupt DEA officer and his men, a 12 year old girl takes refuge in a neighbour's apartment. A neighbour who it turns out is a professional hitman. She soon convinces him to train her to be his protégée.This was French director Luc Besson's first American movie. It is a follow up of sorts to his earlier chic action-thriller Nikita (1990), with Jean Reno essentially reprising his role of a cleaner (professional assassin), although in this one he is playing a different character. Like all Besson's movies there is considerable style brought to the table with the action sequences once again particularly well-delivered. But perhaps the true revelation of the movie is Natalie Portman who puts in an extremely strong performance for such a young actress, full of charisma, humour and emotional depth. She plays off well against Reno, who is also impressive. Gary Oldman, on the other hand, is pretty grating and annoying mostly as the main villain, a character who is cartoonish and somewhat ridiculous overall.While I do find this film good quality for the most part, with great action sequences and some interesting characterisations, I have to express serious reservations about the director's cut, where Portman's young character is constantly trying to get Reno to sleep with her. Its majorly uncomfortable stuff and really entirely unnecessary. And while Léon does spurn her advances, it's never really very clear that he rejects her for entirely the right reasons. Seemingly in the original script, the characters do actually end up sleeping together, which we can only be grateful never actually made the final cut but it does make you wonder what Besson was thinking with all this questionable stuff. My advice would be to avoid the director's cut and watch this one in the trimmed version, which removes all this contentious material."
saje_,"Oct 30, 2021",2/10,"The only reason I'm not giving it 1 star is because the performances were incredible. Gary Oldman was phenomenal, and this was Natalie Portman's first acting credit, and she did so well considering how young she was. But that also segues into the main and irredeemable issue with this movie; Leon and Mathilda's relationship.Mathilda is insanely sexualized and Leon honestly doesn't do a ton to dismiss her feelings toward him. The movie on its own is disturbing, but knowing that Luc Besson married and impregnated a 15 year old girl when he was 31 really sheds a lot more light on the situation. In the international version of the film there are a lot more sexual situations with Leon and Mathilda, and in the original script, Besson went so far as to write in the two of them having sex. It's clear that this film is a reflection of Besson's own deranged life, and unfortunately the spectacular performances and every other great aspect of the film that garnered significant critical acclaim cannot redeem the film. I simply cannot overlook the depravity of a pedophilic relationship, portrayed as some beautiful thing."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 11, 2023",10/10,"A hitman is forced to look after twelve year old Matilda, who's family has been killed.Leon was and will forever be a masterpiece, it is a thought provoking, dramatic and pretty violent thriller, one that will actually challenge you, making you question what's actually happening in front of your eyes.Violent and bleak in parts, but not lacking some humour, the game of charades for example is a real hoot, and breaks the serious narrative up a little.Best scene for me, the showdown in The Gent's toilet, where Matilda finally confronts Stan, the acting is off the scale.The relationship between Leon and Matilda is complex, but one thing that I noticed, is that every aspect of it is driven by Matilda, not Leon, he just goes with the flow.The acting is phenomenal, there are a trio of first class performances, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman as you'd expect are captivating, but credit to a young Natalie Portman who is on par, defying her young age and inexperience, no wonder.This amazing film still packs a punch.10/10."
Sickfrog,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"This film, better known in the U.S. as ""The Professional"", is a wonderful and intense film. Jean Reno plays his role as a ""cleaner"" with incredible subtlety. Leon tries to keep his emotions completely suppressed, yet Matilda (in an extraordinary performance by a young Natalie Portman, who is destined to become a very powerful actress into her adult life) bring out in him a new-found joy for life that accompanies his growing paternal instincts. But, the most dynamic element of this film is undeniably Gary Oldman's performance as a wildly sadistic and crooked DEA agent with his own narcotic-induced demons. His obsessions eventually lead him to the brink of absolute madness in his hunt for the cleaner. Truly, this is Oldman's finest performance to date, worthy of Oscar glory, though sadly forgotten. And so, Luc Besson did indeed top his triumph of ""La Femme Nikita"" by far with this masterpiece. Though, I cannot exactly praise his most recent effort with the sci-fi misfire, ""The Fifth Element."""
psiko,"Aug 5, 1999",10/10,"An interview with Anne Parillaud, in the Evening Standard, 24.8.90, it was said that the message of Nikita is not one of violence but the idea is that people who are full of despair and missing love are not alone.This idea continues in Léon. Léon was Besson's first foray into international film production. The similarities, or parallels, between Nikita and Léon are undoubted. Both the central protagonists attempt to come to terms with their dysfunctionality, to society, against a background of violence, which they both continue to act upon as the agent of someone else. There is no clean difference (we may also include Le Dernier Combat for comparison.) The only difference is gender.I always found that until obtaining the ""Version Integral"" there was a character hole in the plot. The original cut released for US audiences was felt, by Besson, had an ""offending"" scene cut which ruined later scenes. The American test audiences hated it, seeing it as perverse and paedophiliac. The film was still panned by US critics as quasi-child pornography on general release. What it to be understood about this film, and this is what infuriated Besson, is that the film is about pure love. Not sex, which is all the Americans, could see.And so we have ascertained that the characters in Besson's films are, simply, great. Then there is the action which is all the grace and style of Nikita. Typical of Besson's style with fast action-shooting and violent characterisation. This has to be one of Jean Reno's and by far Natalie Portman's best screen performance. To me, Gary Oldman plays his part to the tee, said by some magazines to be the best screen bad guy - it is one of his best performances.Stylisation and excess are hallmarks of Besson's work. Characters are larger than life. Décors are in excess of realism. Besson's characters lack psychological depth. ""The sumptuous and the ornate cohabit with the violent or the vulgar."" Besson's use of excess is also extremely playful mixing violence with humour. Besson's work appeals to the tastes of popular culture and may not please that of the elite - arguably a reason for the rejection of his work by many intellectual film journals.I have yet to hear of a person putting a bad word against this film. There is nothing I can personally fault so I give this film 10/10, a score only two other somewhat different films hold in my IMDb list of 345 films - ""The Wizard of Oz"" and ""La Cité des Enfants perdu"". If you like French Cinema or consider yourself a cinephile you must see the latter."
cemoturanli,"Jul 25, 2025",10/10,"I don't care what you say about Luc Besson or his personality but there is no way that you question the greatness of this masterpiece. I got to see this in the cinema and the bond between Leon and Mathilda is just so pure and amazing as well as the fact that she did this while she was only 13 years old. I agree with the reviews saying that she was hypersexualized and I am disgusted by Luc Besson but in all truth, he managed to make this epic movie which I continue to admire, as well as Sting's song ""Shape of my Heart"" which remains as one of my favourite songs right now which fits perfectly to the end of this movie."
petarmatic,"Apr 11, 2014",7/10,"I was very surprised to see that this film received such a high grade. I did not think it deserves it.Things i liked about it. It is the acting of two principal actors, Mr. Reno I like very much from the times of La Femme Nikita, he is a spectacular actor, especially in the roles like these. Natalie Portman is also excellent in a role like this, later in the Star Wars I did not like her that much. I think as a young teenager in this film she is excellent, for the later roles I am not that sure.Things I did not like. Plot is not realistic. I simply do not like that. When is something like this possible in the real life? Never. Also too much violence, but films of Luc Besson are always like that. I guess it has to be that way. Violence and sex sells. Especially if you throw a slight nudge of pedophilia in it."
robelanator,"Feb 24, 2005",8/10,"""...if it's from a person who doesn't care about it.""What really stands out for me (aside from the really excellent direction of the action sequences) is the too-brilliant for its own good script. Oldman,Reno, and Portman deliver lines that would seem goofy if spoken by lesser performers. Oldman especially chews the scenery in a way that's both amusing and utterly menacing. I wonder if his Beethoven obsession is a nod to the ultra-violent Alex from A Clockwork Orange?The American version (""The Professional"") was the first version I saw. I'd originally had no real intention of seeing it because I'd read a pretty savage review of it likening it to child pornography. Clearly this particular reviewer had his head firmly planted in his rear. I'm surprised he could find room what with that tremendous stick in the way. Anyway, once I finally saw ""Leon"" for myself - thanks to my cinemaphile grandfather - I observed no such thing. This wasn't smut, it was love. Leon has no interest in Matilda sexually, but loves her as a father would love a daughter.If you have a choice then go for the longer director's cut. You get about 15 minutes more film - and not just filler. These are scenes that truly expand upon the story.My only complaints are about the almost complete under use of the completely underrated Danny Aiello, and Oldman's single dimensional evilness."
Xstal,"Dec 18, 2022",9/10,"Leon is a cleaner for his boss, it's like removing bits of debris when you floss, a variety of tools, he always plays by his set rules, now he's taken in a girl he's come across. She purports to be 18 but she's a child, had to grow up quick with a family that's quite wild, now they have wounds, that won't be healed, after messing with Stansfield, that's left her quite annoyed and somewhat, slightly riled. It's a story of revenge and adolescence, of walking a fine line that may cause offence, but there's chemistry and connection, performances played to perfection, quite original, without too much pretence.Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and especially Gary Oldman are immense."
tbtgjin,"Feb 23, 2019",10/10,"Beautiful movie, compelling storyline, deeply conceived characters.Worth watching for many reasons, but my favourite is watching Gary Oldman at his young crazy best."
imdbfan-346703,"Jul 28, 2025",10/10,"Some movies you watch, enjoy, and move on. But Léon is not one of those movies. It's been hours since I watched it, and I'm still thinking about it. I don't even know how to describe it properly, but that 90s Little Italy vibe, the gritty but strangely warm streets of New York... it just pulls you in. You feel the mood before the story even starts.Jean Reno is incredible. He barely speaks, yet you understand everything he feels. Léon is this cold hitman on the outside, but underneath, there's this simple, pure-hearted man. Watching him actually hurt me at times. And Natalie Portman... I can't believe how young she was. She completely disappears into Mathilda. All the pain, the anger, her tough little moments-she makes it so real. At some point, you stop watching a movie and start living it.The bond between Léon and Mathilda is... strange, sure. It's not the typical connection we're used to seeing. But it's also emotional, raw, and oddly beautiful. There's this innocent kind of love and trust between them that feels rare and very real.And then there's Gary Oldman-honestly, one of the most terrifying villains I've ever seen. The guy is completely unhinged, and you never know what he'll do next. He's scary but so captivating. Every scene he's in, you can't look away.This film isn't just about action. It's about loneliness, connection, revenge, growing up too fast. It hits emotionally while keeping you on edge. The music, the pacing, the way it's shot-everything works so well together.What else can I say? Léon isn't just a film, it's an experience. For me, it's easily one of the best of all time. Just... amazing."

leftwichzachary,"Aug 15, 2024",10/10,"Its a film where you just feel pure raw emotion as if you're the character or if you're seeing it first hand in person. A film with such a perfect selection of a cast with such underrated actors such as Jean Reno, Natalie Portman debuting in her first ever film which launched her acting career, Gary Oldman, and so many others. A film with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Its a film that's meant to be experienced through emotion, not through explanation just like Leon whenever you would see his character's facial expressions of what he would feel, like the amount of strong emotion behind it, is incredible, especially towards the end of the movie where you'd expect it to end off in a happy ending but it ends sadly. It can't be described fully in words, just through your own heart & emotion, especially with how perfect the film was, like there's no flaws with it. It's a film filled with strong emotional, action-packed storyline and soundtracks that honestly make you feel sad for Leon and Mathilda as if you're a part of them. Jean Reno truly nailed the performance like hes so underrated, and it really shows the amount of talent Natalie had which started her career in one of the greatest films of all time like all the roles were nailed perfectly. Its just a masterpiece. Not only that but this movie didn't have much of a budget either, and it turned out to be so successful and one of the greatest films of all time, which you can't deny, its something that everyone agrees on, like it or not, it is. Luc Besson the director literally nailed it & also proved how even at the time you didn't need that need such a huge budget to accomplish these things, and what an era it was, and what a big name for European Films if not the greatest European film, in comparison with American films that need such a big budget to accomplish the effects, it really shows the difference between the two as all thats needed is raw emotion. Such a masterpiece, a film like I said filled with such an emotional bond that you honestly can't explain it fully, its something that you honestly have to feel it to experience it. Truly unforgettable, memorable and much more. I honestly wish it got more credit that it was unfortuantely given, it honestly deserved so much credit, especially an award for Jean Leno and his performance. Such a perfect selection, such a perfect story, film, and of course music selection. One of the few films where you experience raw emotion, and feelings."
Junker-2,"Dec 20, 2004",6/10,"It is a mystery to me why ""The Professional"" is rated so high here on the IMDb...#62 as I write this. To be sure, there is much to admire here. But for everything director Luc Besson gets right with this movie he seems to get something else quite terribly wrong.Let's start with the positive: Natalie Portman as Mathilda is a revelation here. Young, beautiful and very, very talented, it should come as no surprise after watching this movie why George Lucas wanted her to play a major role in his second ""Star Wars"" trilogy. And Jean Reno as Leon is her perfect counterpart. Reno underplays his role beautifully and the two stars develop a true screen chemistry.Oh, but now the negatives. Gary Oldman, normally a wonderful villain, is way, way over the top as the DEA agent Stanfield. He ""chews up the scenery"" to quote other reviewers I have read. (That's not a compliment.) And Oldman's lunatic rantings lead me to the main problem I have with the movie: Plot holes.In order to fully believe the events of this movie you must accept that Stanfield is at least somewhat capable of behaving in a normal manner in society. After all, he holds an important position in the DEA. And he must have a supervisor or two, doesn't he? Could the raving lunatic we see here really function in that role without raising a dozen red flags? I don't think so.Of course, Stanfield has a merry band of followers. Dozens, it seems. One has to wonder if every cop in the city is as corrupt as he is. How in the world do they burst into someone's apartment, kill his wife (in the bathtub!) as well as his teenage daughter and four year old son...again all without raising any red flags?And speaking of that pivotal scene, it is also hard for me to accept that Mathilda's father, knowing what is coming, would not have had his entire family out of that apartment by Noon.The biggest plot hole, however, is the relationship between Mathilda and Leon. As well acted as it is, the lone wolf hit-man deciding to ""adopt"" a 12 year old girl just does not ring true. It is far too clearly a mere plot device.While watching this movie I was often reminded of the film ""Taxi Driver"" which deals with many of the same themes. ""Taxi Driver"" is a movie that deserves a high ranking in the IMDB top 250. ""The Professional"" does not."
lbournelos,"Jul 6, 2019",10/10,"Dosage: One good scenario with clever script, one inspired European director (Luc Besson), one non jeune-premier leading role actor (Jean Reno), one blooming and promising young female actress in the best - by far- role of her career (Natalie Portman), two (at least) prime role actors (Danny Aiello and Gary Oldman), perfect positioning and angle of camera, ideal balance between reality, sense and imagination, to mention some of the parts of perfection.
I'm easy, if I 'm satisfied, to give a 9/10, but having spent decades behind cameras 10/10 is given only to 6 movies, since 1927 (Metropolis)."
BA_Harrison,"Apr 24, 2017",7/10,"An unlikely relationship forms between 12-year-old Mathilda (Natalie Portman), who seeks revenge on the gangsters who slaughtered her family, and an assassin, Léon (Jean Reno), who lives in the same apartment building and teaches her how to 'clean'.A love story between a grown man and a twelve year old girl: sounds a bit dodgy, doesn't it? Director Luc Besson tries his hardest to pull it off by making Reno's character almost childlike, and having Portman's Mathilda act well beyond her years, swearing, smoking, and more than capable of looking after herself. In the end, though, it still feels very awkwardSporting a Louise Brooks bobbed haircut and wearing shorts and a vest, Mathilda is definitely sexualised, kinda like a cross between Lolita, Mindy from Kick Ass and that girl from Lazy Town, which makes her relationship with Léon rather uncomfortable viewing at times, especially when the characters declare their feelings for each other, or when Mathilda tells a hotel manager that she is Léon's lover.Thankfully, the film's love angle is never developed beyond the platonic, and Besson breaks up the emotional drama with numerous shootouts and explosions as Mathilda tries to find and kill villain Stansfield (Gary Oldman) with help from Léon. It's mindlessly entertaining, I suppose, but not nearly good enough to warrant the film's current IMDb ranking (#27 in the Top 250).6.5 out of 10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
greybitsdmg,"Nov 11, 2009",10/10,"When I first watched this film at the cinema, I wasn't aware of IMDb. I've since watched it probably 4 or 5 times, and have recently bought the Directors Cut. Having used IMDb a lot recently, I checked out Leon. It was kind of heart warming, having a great deal of my memories of this movie from the previous 15 years being revisited upon me so eloquently whilst reading the comments.It is a glorious film. One that I've not been able to forget for all the best reasons. I think you could probably choose any sub category art that forms a movie i.e., editing or cinematography, and you'd be hard pushed to find fault.What makes this film Extra Special however, is the emotional 'ballet' taking place throughout the film.My emotions were pretty much assaulted by a gang of joy/sadness/hate/fearful anticipation/love/empathy/shock/horror/hope.It's one of those films.I adored/respected/loved Leon (I still watch nearly every film with Jean Reno in).I fell in love with Matilda. I've watched everyone of Natalie Portman's films since too.I was already a fan of Gary Oldman. This film just added extra glue to that bond. He made a brilliant sociopath, in direct contrast to Leon's (anti-)sociopath.I occasionally feel for a character (or two if it's a great romance), but it's very rare for me to be drawn into three so very different people's intimate lives so easily.It's a shame there are too few films of this calibre."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 4, 2011",10/10,"Luc Besson's film Leon:The Professional is a superb one. Visually, it is very stylish, with striking location work, atmospheric lighting and really authentic and bold cinematography. The soundtrack also does very well in enhancing the mood of each scene, and Besson's direction is faultless.There is also a gripping story with well crafted characters particularly Mathilda and Jean Reno's character Leon, a cracking script and crisp pacing and while there are some over-the-top and intense moments particularly with Stansfield and the beginning, particularly as the chemistry between Mathilda and Leon expands there are some poignant ones too.The acting is excellent. Jean Reno is charismatic and commanding in the title role while Gary Oldman is wildly bombastic as Stansfield. But I was especially impressed by Natalie Portman, who delivers one of the best and most captivating feature debuts ever. In conclusion, a fantastic film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
WardaI-9,"Jul 27, 2025",10/10,"An exceptional film that delivers on every leve story, acting, direction, and visuals. The characters are deeply relatable, and the narrative unfolds with perfect pacing and emotional weight. It's a cinematic experience that stays with you, thought-provoking and beautifully executed from start to finish!"
SaiP-444,"Aug 17, 2025",10/10,"Leon is one of the most emotionally intense movies ever made. French director Luc Besson uses everything: actors, music, camera angles, lighting to create an unique experience - ""It's not realism, it's not naturalism - it's heightened reality"" as Gary Oldman very well put it.In ""The making of The Professional"" Besson says ""If I imagine somebody in the street try to knock on my daughter, I kill the guy, in five seconds. I kill him, and I think ""It's in me, I'm a beast!"" On this part we can't forget that a part of us, the genetic things inside are much, much older than The Ten Commandments""."
OrangeSequins,"Aug 10, 2025",10/10,"""Léon: The Professional"" is absolutely perfect. It blends action, drama, and emotion in a way that feels completely natural and deeply engaging.The story is straightforward but incredibly effective. It follows the unusual relationship between a hitman and a young girl, balancing tense action scenes with moments of genuine warmth and humanity. It is both thrilling and heartfelt, and every scene feels purposeful.Jean Reno gives a phenomenal performance as Léon, bringing quiet strength and vulnerability to the role. Natalie Portman, in her debut, is remarkable as Mathilda, delivering a performance far beyond her years. Gary Oldman is unforgettable as the unhinged villain, creating one of his most iconic characters.The direction by Luc Besson is excellent. The pacing is tight, the action is well staged, and the emotional beats are perfectly timed. The cinematography captures both the intimacy of the characters and the intensity of the action.The score by Éric Serra fits the film beautifully, adding atmosphere without overwhelming the scenes.So in summary: ""Léon: The Professional"" is a masterclass in combining action with genuine emotion. Outstanding performances, sharp direction, and a perfect balance of tension and heart make it a true classic."
saikatsamanta,"Sep 18, 2022",10/10,"One of the most iconic Action films of all time, this story is about a ruthless hitman Jean Reno and his next door neighbour, 12 year old Natalie Portman who lives in an abusive household and how a tragedy makes this two tormented souls find each other, love and life again. Luc Besson directs this one with plenty of bloody and uber stylish action scenes and some really touching moments. The music is pretty damn fantastic and the editing is crisp. Jean Reno owns his role with stonecold attitude but also possess this awkward innocence. Portman gives probably the greatest performance from a Child Actor, playing a kid hungry for love but has grown up too quickly amidst crime. Gary Oldman goes off the hinges, playing a Crooked DEA cop, belting out one iconic line after another. You can watch this film again and again, a Masterpiece !!!"
PopNLockLochNessMonsta,"Aug 21, 2007",6/10,"I went into watching this movie with high hopes considering its very high user ranking on IMDb which can usually be trusted. People praised this movie for its amazing action and beautifully scripted drama, neither of which i saw in this movie. The movie was simply average, i didn't feel emotionally connected to the characters and i was not blown away by the action which was few and far between. The acting performances were again mediocre, i found that nobody really stood out in this movie. It's a forgettable average movie that is clearly overrated. I look at some of the amazing movies that this is ahead of on the IMDb list and i cant figure out how someone could possibly think that this is a better movie."
Devi40,"Jul 16, 2019",1/10,"Based on the reviews on IMDB, I decided to watch this movie. The first 20 minutes are interesting but after that it is just freaking uncomfortable. A 12-year old girl who is showing way too much body, uses vulgar language and is basically admiring a French dude and he even likes it! This movie is disturbing and if you don't see that, than you have been brainwashed. Open your eyes people!"
Quinoa1984,"Mar 20, 2005",9/10,"I sensed that Luc Besson (director of The Fifth Element and La Femme Nikita) was, like Tarantino and many, many others before him, borrowed elements from various films and genres to create their own voice in the film. With Leon, I sensed him alluding to the crime films of France (i.e. Melville), Hong-Kong (i.e. Woo), and America (i.e. Scorsese), and making it into his own special brand for the story and characters. That his style visually is as compelling helps a great deal. The international version (which is the one I saw) is a little grittier, and more suggestive, than the version most American audiences saw in 1994 and on cable. But it is also a must-see if you are planning to see the film. It's not a long movie, though it gives a good many details in its story.Jean Reno has his star-making turn (at least for what he's worth) in Leon- he's ruthless contract killer who will kill just about anyone for the right price. He lives out of an apartment by himself, trying his best to ignore his noisy neighbors. One of the daughters is Mathilda (Natalie Portman, also a major breakthrough performance), abused by her whole family to no end. When a corrupt cop (Gary Oldman, one of the key villain performances of his career along with Dracula and Drexl in True Romance) goes and kills off her family while she's away, she has no one else to turn to besides the reclusive killer. She knows what he does, and she wants in. The rest of the film is about their relationship, as it unfolds professionally and emotionally, leading to a tremendous, bloody climax.One thing that struck me most about Leon is the fact that the film was more disturbing than I expected. The idea of a killer getting a pupil in a young teenage girl is unusual enough, but the way it unfolds I felt so much for her plight got to me at times. this doesn't make Leon a tear-jerker (maybe for some, I'm not sure), but because of Portman's dead-on portrayal, it makes the story work somehow, and is in a way as fantastical as it is naturalistic. There are also a few scenes that stuck out as being little masterpieces of all the elements coming together. The first is a brief scene, and crucial to showing the character of Leon early on- he takes a break after his contract, and sees a movie, a musical with Gene Kelly. He's the only one in the theater, and he is completely in the grasp of what he sees on the screen. It's the perfect touch of humanity and shows his only escape is into complete fantasy.The second is when Leon and Mathilda are in a restaurant, after she has just gone through a day of training (there's a hilarious montage that follows this scene). Mathilda is getting drunk off of champagne, rambling with words she may or may not mean. Suddenly, she starts laughing, and she laughs more, and harder. People in the restaurant look at her like she's nuts. Leon is, of course, embarrassed. However, I thought this was just the right touch to this scene, where the kind of father-daughter relationship going on between Leon and Mathilda is revealed. It's not exactly funny, not even really cringe worthy. It just is. The third scene is when Mathilda decides to pay a visit to the man who murdered her family. She follows the man into the bathroom, and waits. Suddenly, he (Oldman) appears out from behind a door. The language used, the tenseness of the two off of one another, it's simply the most terrifying scene in the picture (aside from the first violent turning point).So, basically, when Leon finished, I think I realized that my reaction was this: if I had seen this film when I was younger, be it in high school or even middle school, I would've responded to it even more strongly than I do now. There's something very visceral about the nature of violence and killing, as well as the mentor/pupil relationship, that Besson really gets down pat. While some of the situations have the chance of slipping into clichés, it doesn't happen very often. Leon: The Professional, is hard-hitting when it has to be, soft and funny when it can, and does stay with the viewer a few days after it's over."
alwayslikethis,"Dec 23, 2002",10/10,"I saw this movie in the theatre in 1994 and I really like it then, but at the time I wouldnt be able to tell you why. The next time I saw the movie was at home on TIVO, in December 2001 and I fell in love with the film all over again.Firstly, the theme of the movie - Isolation and Redemption - The characters Leon and Mathilda had no one who loved them in this world and were very much alone (mathilda did have her 4 year old brother but that was all she had)The characters were dealing with a similar lonlieness even thought heir worlds were very different.Secondly, the scripting in the film really hit me. When a bloodied, beaten Mathilda turns to Leon after meeting him only once or twice, she says to him ""Is life always this hard or just when your a kid?"" Leon pauses and his response to her was not what anyone would expect. The whole movie is well scripted and blows me away.Thirdly, The cinematography is top notch. When Mathilda arrives at Leons door and she pleads to enter and when the door opens bathing her in light is simply breathtaking. The close-ups on the characters and the way the camera is held over their shoulder as they talk with each other really gives it a personal feel to allow you to empathise with the characters. I could go on about the cinematography more but I have more.Fourth, the music by Eric Serra. I really enjoyed the music more and more with each viewing as I came to realize that the soundtrack was orchestrated specifically after each scene was filmed and then the music was designed to match what was happening on screen. Sometimes, I watch the movie and just pay close attention to the details in the music. It creates a whole new perspective.Fifth, the acting and the casting. Jean Reno plays Leon so perfectly. You really can sense what the character is about. The soft spoken hitman who is like a child in many ways but extremely skilled at his job. Natalie Portman plays the street wise Mathilda who has to pull off one hell of a performance. Many say it is her best role and I agree. Much of the acting by both of these characters is done with simple facial expression. The dialogue between these two leaves you wanting to see more. Danny Aiello as Tony. Gotta love Tony. Is he a good guy or a bad guy? Its open to debate and thats the way it is intended. Gary Oldman as Stansfield - The bad cop - what can you say? he plays the role over the top and is perfect and nuts.Sixth, Luc Besson, director, writer and visionary who saw the potential of this film and went for it. How could anyone expect a movie that has a hitman who protects a twelve year old girl who falls in love with him and wants to be trained as an assassin to be a great film? Luc and Co. realized the dre am and brought the right people on board to make this very special film. I am amazed that it even came to be. He rested 50% of the acting chores on a 12 yr. old girl with no acting lessons or experience - his film depended on her and he was a little worried, no doubt. But he showed her what he needed from her and she gave everything she had... and it shows.All I can say is this movie is like a song that I never grow tired off. I know there are others who fell the same way. Feel free to email me and join the Leon fan club on yahoo. 10 out of 10, of course."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 25, 2025",9/10,"""Léon: The Professional"" is an incredible film that goes beyond the typical action-thriller. Jean Reno is perfect as the quiet, disciplined assassin, Léon, and Natalie Portman delivers a stunning debut performance as the tough and vulnerable Mathilda. The film's heart lies in their unique bond-a mix of protector and student, friend and confidante.The cinematography is also top-notch, with Luc Besson creating a gritty, stylish vision of New York City. The action is explosive and intense, but it's the quiet moments of emotional vulnerability that truly stand out.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. ""Léon: The Professional"" is a must-watch film. It's a classic for a reason, blending intense action with a deeply emotional and character-driven narrative. The performances from both lead actors are outstanding, and the film's unique tone makes it a standout in the genre."
drewconnor,"Nov 12, 2013",10/10,"This is one of my all time favourite films, its a great story of a hired assassin in New York who meets a young girl played by a young Natalie Portman (the daughter of a neighbour) who soon becomes an orphan because of the ruthless corrupt and crazy DEA Police officer played by the fantastic Gary Oldman, who shows one of his best performances in this movie.Its packed full of action including an explosive finale, but its just not an action thriller, its a very powerful and moving story.I have often found it hard to describe the relationship between the ""cleaner"" played by Reno and Portman's character. He I feel sees her as the family he has never had. She obviously has a crush and sees him in romantic way, which he doesn't encourage and struggles to cope with!!! its these unexpected twists in the story and clever sub plot that makes the film stand out from the crowd. its a modern classic and needs 10 stars. Watch and enjoy endlessly"
snaper-1,"Dec 24, 2014",10/10,"I was a teenager when I first saw the movie. It was recorded on VHS tape and it was supposed to be just a good movie worth watching. I couldn't believe how this epic movie ""grabbed my heart"" and I was wordless after the end of it. I am still so impressed every time I watched it again and again. This was the first movie with Jan Reno starring I watched. He became one of my favorite actors with his ""simplicity"" of acting and being the good bad guy. Gary Oldman was brilliant with his mad behavior and strong powerful playing. The little Natalie was the ""icing on the cake"" and she was as good as it was Macaulay Culkin in Home Alone. So I strongly recommend this film to everyone who is looking for a big entertainment."
rahuldeep-37247,"Mar 29, 2025",10/10,"""Léon: The Professional"" is a 1994 film directed by Luc Besson that has cemented its place as a cult classic. Its narrative, a unique blend of action, drama, and an unconventional coming-of-age story, continues to resonate with audiences. Here's a breakdown of the film's key elements:
* A Unique Relationship:
* At the heart of ""Léon"" is the complex relationship between Léon (Jean Reno), a solitary and highly skilled hitman, and Mathilda (Natalie Portman, in her debut role), a 12-year-old girl who becomes his unlikely protégé.* Their connection is born out of tragedy, as Mathilda's family is brutally murdered by corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman).* Léon reluctantly takes Mathilda in, and she, in turn, seeks to learn his trade to avenge her brother's death. This creates a powerful dynamic, blending elements of mentorship, surrogate family, and a poignant emotional bond.* Character Studies:
* The film excels in its character development. Léon is portrayed as a man of few words, living a regimented and isolated existence. Yet, beneath his hardened exterior lies a sense of vulnerability.* Mathilda is a precocious and resilient child, forced to confront the harsh realities of the adult world. Her desire for revenge is tempered by her growing affection for Léon.* Gary Oldman's portrayal of Stansfield is a masterclass in villainy, creating a truly unsettling and memorable antagonist.* Themes and Impact:
* ""Léon"" explores themes of isolation, violence, redemption, and the search for human connection.* The film's visual style, combined with Éric Serra's evocative score, creates a palpable atmosphere of tension and melancholy.* It has been praised for its nuanced portrayal of the central relationship, which avoids simplistic sentimentality.* The movie has caused conversations, and sometimes controversy, due to the nature of the relationship between the adult Leon, and the child Mathilda.* Legacy:
* ""Léon: The Professional"" has had a lasting impact on cinema, influencing subsequent action and thriller films.* It is considered a career-defining role for both Jean Reno and Natalie Portman.* The film's enduring popularity is a testament to its compelling story, memorable characters, and its ability to evoke a wide range of emotions.In summary, ""Léon: The Professional"" is a film that transcends genre conventions, offering a powerful and moving exploration of human connection in the midst of violence and chaos."
paul2001sw-1,"Feb 24, 2010",6/10,"With it's soundtrack of Bjork and Sting, Luc Besson's film 'Leon' certainly reminds one of the early 1990s. The film also showcases Besson's ability to create a visually coherent and interesting world, in this case a slightly earlier, grottier New York brought to life on camera. But the plot and characters are frankly silly and quite dull, unless one happens to find firearms inherently interesting. What keeps the film watchable is the winning performance from a young Nathalie Portman, who makes her own entry in the canon of precocious movie children. In fact, it feels like a bit of a guilty pleasure to enjoy her, because there's no doubt that the director is playing up her incipient sexuality; and while we may be supposed to laugh at the twelve-year old acting sixteen, I felt, in watching this movie, that the director was encouraging his audience to sexualise the character (or at least exploiting their expected reaction); there's definitely something not quite childish about it. I haven't seen her act better in anything she's made since."
reenkhan,"Oct 2, 2016",6/10,"This movie was totally disturbing for me, the blatant pedophillic speech and action was sickening, I couldn't sit still whilst watching this, I kept squirming in my seat. I don't know that the director was on, or the writers/producers. Must have been crack, or maybe Jimmy savil wrote this. And why isn't she wearing normal clothes in the entire movie.? She's dressed like a hooker! I just think it's really inappropriate I do understand the Leon doesn't return her advances, but he doesn't stop them either. And some of the stuff she says is so uncomfortable I'm shocked so many people have watched it. I for one think that even though the storyline is good, poor Natalie Portmans childhood was ruined"
PFFAW,"Nov 27, 2022",1/10,"Pedophilia is not entertainment. Luc Besson ""started dating"" the blonde woman at the beginning when she was fifteen, and she had his baby when she was 16. The film is inspired by their relationship, which began when she was 11. Disgusting. Luc Besson should be cancelled like Woody Allen. I feel so bad for Natalie Portman. She was sexualized at such a young age, and she's spoken publicly about how traumatic it was for her. This film should be removed from Amazon Prime, and quite frankly, all of Luc Besson's works should be removed from all streaming platforms. Thank God we've evolved since this abuse was acceptable."
romandhshin,"Oct 21, 2018",10/10,"The International Cut includes almost 30 extra minutes of scenes that are critically important to Leon and Mathilda's character development, the context of their relationship, and the overall atmosphere of the film. The American version censors all of this and only focuses on the action parts of the movie."
gigabyte89,"Dec 2, 2008",10/10,"This movie is a piece of Art. Truly unique in its genre. It successfully blends action, drama, thriller (...you name it) together. It’s masterfully directed by Luc Besson which proves that you don’t need a big budget to make a really good movie. The shooting is awesome- Camera angles, close to face camera focus, scenes such as Mathilda’s face illuminating as the door opens and the white flash at the end is simply awesome! The Musical score and soundtrack such as Sting and Björk is again... Very well chosen and fits the movie completely! The movie contains some unforgettable dialogues & scenes too. The scene where there is a burst of laughter in the Restaurant or the toilet scene with Gary Oldman is just a treat to watch that guy act! From its explosive start to its brilliant ending, no any segments gets boring at any time, everything is relevant and you just want more!The acting by the magical Trio Jean Reno-Nathalie Portman-Gary Oldman just smokes! ‘Nuff said. Probably one of the best I’ve ever seen in a movie. You could read everything just on their facial expressions and looks real. It’s really amazing…About the controversial pedophile issue I think you guys are pushing this a little too far. The Bed scenes etc, it is not sex but platonic love as Besson said! It’s that “love in the air” that makes the movie even more gripping.Timeless classic and among just the handful of movies you could watch indefinitely… No questions. I’m always happy. This is a straight 10. This is my favorite movie."
dnjjr,"Mar 14, 2006",9/10,"N.B. Spoilers within. Part action/thriller, part character study, ""Leon (The Professional)"" is a sure-fire bet for lovers of both categories. The story is about the meticulous hit-man and determined loner Leon (an amazing Jean Reno) and the precocious 12-year-old Mathilda (the equally amazing Natalie Portman) who crashes his party. They are vastly different from each other, separated not just by wide gaps in age, culture, and experience, but by their basic psychologies.Leon runs a strictly one-man show by sheer will and by necessity: it allows him to survive and flourish. But as bottled up as he is, he is marked by tragedy and sorrow. These feelings he keeps tightly compartmentalized, which makes him so successful as a killing machine. Enter Mathilda, the product of a wholly dysfunctional home, where she was regularly beaten and abused by her drug-dealing father and loveless family. Despite this, she is by nature a strong, hopeful, and highly intuitive girl. The movie throws these two together and lovingly documents their emotional journey toward each other.All of this is skillfully woven with Leon's violent line of work, providing the film with some spectacular action sequences. It gets even better when the savvy Mathilda joins Leon on the job, giving her a sense of purpose while forcing Leon to join the human race, or at least one headstrong member of it. The movie really succeeds when it goes deeply into the emotions driving each character. Mathilda, after all, is just discovering love and sexuality, which she presses on Leon, the object of her newfound desires. As for him, Leon can barely stand this nuisance at first, but gradually becomes the caring father figure she never had. The more she gets under his skin, the harder he looks into himself to do the right thing for her. This whole process becomes incredibly touching. You root for these two oddballs; they flesh out a unique love story.Meanwhile, Leon and Mathilda are up against one of the stranger villains of the 90s, the malicious D.E.A. agent Norman Stansfield (Gary Oldman: he scores again). Stansfield is also an oddball: he is outrageously high-strung (always being pampered and brought back to reality by his fellow nasties), he pops weird pills, and rambles on about Beethoven to his soon-to-be-dispatched victims. In any case, he is a creepy, ruthless dude.Besson keeps the tension high for much of the film, letting go only long enough for the occasional scene where Leon and Mathilda have some time alone. (The two actors really shine here.) Otherwise, the film has a running undercurrent of menace and unpredictability. Compassion and cruelty weave continually in and out.The film's climax is gripping, and the do-or-die moment when Leon and Mathilda say goodbye is positively heart-wrenching. The two have come a very long way. A good word should be put in, too, for the always dependable Danny Aiello as Tony, Leon's boss and a father figure himself.This is a smart, highly enjoyable film  tight, focused, and personal. It's a rush for the senses and a gratifying story of memorable characters."
the-fearless-america,"Apr 24, 2016",10/10,"Leon is an adjustment of what a true modern drama genre is. Luc Besson made a real combustion here. He made a genuinely semi drama-action film which for me definitely in my top 10 best movies ever made. Despite lack of rating from movie professionals, I stated that this movie is one of the most impacts to me. The storytelling installment that this movie had was incredibly powerful, precise, and so freaking deep. It consist of a very strong bond of a little girl to a professional assassin which maybe it's too simple as shape but will plunging the audiences into his childish cry at the time, especially at the ending.In the shape of it's plot, I think Leon is one kind of movie that have a similar plot structure as Charlie Chaplin's ""City Lights"", but had a different style in movie making technique and how the way the story of the plot untold. Most people said the strong point of the genre was It's action. Not for me, It was the drama which intensify the whole movie. Firstly, the director wanted to slowly generated a strong bond of It's two leads. Then in the end, BAMM.. Everythings disappeared, everything destroyed, just in short period of time. It possessing a deep desperation feeling into the audience. Audience want the happy ending because of the caring and daring reason (which accumulated expeditiously because of the two lead's strong performance, especially Portman), but the real fact that Besson was brave enough to change the way of the old happy ending style implementation. Suspense skill from Besson was perfect, giving the audience to wish the ending they want, but unfortunately It's different, It's freaking sad and painful. I tear to pieces. That's what I feel when watched Leon, I had very similar feeling from City Lights (which ending's strong point was It's uncertainty of approval), two of them (the ending) had very strong impact to audience (all age range from my experience asking other older and younger people).Despite of harsh critic of It's Pedofil issue, I definitely still appreciate Leon so much. This was one of movies that truly inspire me. Leon is the true and the most bitter-sweet movie ever made."
justinraphaelm,"Jun 16, 2017",6/10,"'Leon: the Professional' is a movie that follows a young girl (Nat Portman) who's family (father and brother) is killed in the wake of a drug deal gone wrong, and subsequently, taken in by a neighbouring assassin who teaches her his trade. While the movie is not bad, it still suffers from a predictable plot line - and actions sequences- that, although are entertaining, never rise past the clutches of mid 90's action movie mediocrity. Yes, at times the movie is entertaining, but never more than movies like 'True Lies"", which was filmed around the same time. While there is a saving grace which prevents this movie from being another typical Hollywood mainstream action movie - which is the 3-4 minutes we get to see of Jean Reno connecting with Natalie Portman's character as a 12 year old child - there is not much else except what is to be expected. Nothing blew my mind for instance in the way that 'Reservoir Dogs' did as a violent low budget, yet interesting, character developed movie, or, say 'Pulp fiction' for it's dialogue. Nor did it have the sentimental connection that earned movies like the 'Shawshank redemption' or 'Schindler' list, great professional and public praise. The movie is well done, the actions sequences are also well done for the time, and the overall movie experience is not bad. I may be a little late in reviewing this movie, it having been almost 23 years since the movie graced cinemas,but honestly, considering the reviews that the movie has given, 8.6/10 (IMDB), I find it pretty disappointing (again, not that it was a bad movie, but because it was made to seem better than it is). I wish they had spent little more time connecting the characters of Natalie Portman and Jean Reno a little more, I think it could have been much more sentimental, emotive, and connecting as an overall experience. 6/10"
moneyfornothing85,"Aug 5, 2022",4/10,"(This review is based on the extended version)Let me start off by saying that there are aspects of this film which are very good. The action sequences are thrilling, the cinematography is appealing, and the atmosphere is intriguing. Jean Reno as Léon is great. Danny Aiello as Tony is great. Natalie Portman is also fantastic, but I'm not sure if that's a good thing.Natalie Portman was 12 years old (give or take a year) when this was filmed. She portrays a 12 year old girl named Mathilda. Throughout the film, she wears skimpy, tight fitting clothes, and repeatedly expresses her ""love"" for Léon. Although Léon acts as somewhat of a father figure to her, she makes it clear that she doesn't just see him as a father figure. To put it simply, Mathilda, a very troubled 12 year old girl, wants to bang this middle aged man who is her caretaker. Badly. And this movie isn't subtle about it.It wouldn't be the first time that a young girl had inappropriate feelings towards an older man. The problem is how this film never really addresses the inappropriateness of it. Léon rejects her advances rather lamely, and never explicitly does so for the right reason (SHE'S TWELVE).Let's not forget that the director of this movie dated a girl when she was 15 years old, and got her pregnant at 16.There's more that can be said about how gross all of that is, but there's more to complain about so I'll move on.Gary Oldman's character is a cartoon villain. He's silly. His performance is good, but his character is so over-the-top that it's laughable.The plot is quite simplistic. That's not horrible in and of itself, but this film is a sandwich of a basic revenge story (that's the bread) and a very inappropriate love story (that's the filler). There's a lot more filler than bread, too."
CymanCat,"Jun 8, 2014",10/10,"It's an absolutely stunning film. Period.Even after watching it for the 3rd time, it amazes me how you can really feel the characters coming alive. They breath, you breath. They are happy, you are happy. The most special ingredient of this movie is the mixture of emotions the story creates: For a few minutes, one could think it might be an action adventure, but then, there is the mysterious touch which elevates the viewer into another world without being totally surrealistic.Little time elapses when suddenly the mood changes again from homely, to funny, and in a blink of an eye, it becomes really dramatic. If you would hear this story in the news, it would sound absurd - ridiculously even. But watching this movie is making count every second of it, enjoying it with an intensity as it would be an adventure experience first hand with great pleasure.Thank you for this great enjoyment."
robertcbannon,"Jan 23, 2019",10/10,The film that launched Natalie Portman and put Gary Oldman firmly on the Hollywood map. Not much else to say except sit back and watch three performances which made the 90's.
dorprv,"Sep 4, 2019",10/10,"Well-carved and shaped story about an Hitman, with a Satisfying story, Solid Screenplay, Masterful & Heart- Touching performances by Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie Portman, the movie is a ONE TIME CLASSIC.
As simple is the story as extraordinary is the execution which makes it one of the best Crime/Action I've ever seen.Definitely gonna pull off 10/10 ."
forthosewhowait94,"Aug 22, 2013",10/10,"This film is absolutely brilliant and amazing! It is truly a unique film with fantastic acting and action that will hold you in its grasp. Where are the awards for this film? How come this film is unnoticed? With all of the amazing acting and great storyline, I am surprised this movie did not win an Oscar! Everybody was fantastic in this film! Jean Reno gives a heartwarming performance as a sad and lonely hit-man or ""cleaner"" named Leon who lives in a secluded world in a apartment complex and Natalie Portman's character Mathilda is the one that shatters Leon's secluded world.For this being her first feature film, Natalie Portman gives an amazing and astonishing performance as a troubled little girl with a desire for revenge. Gary Oldman is also fantastic as a twisted, sadistic, and corrupted DEA agent. He is on my list for Top 10 greatest villains ever! The unique love story and father-daughter type relationship between Leon and Mathilda is handled beautifully by director Luc Besson. You will feel so much sympathy for these characters. This movie is the perfect action with a unique love story and unforgettable characters and emotionally charged scenes! Everybody needs to see this movie!"
johnspringer-95440,"Jun 13, 2024",6/10,"An amoral hitman forms an unlikely bond with a precocious young girl whose family has been rubbed out in a drug hit. The acting by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is stellar, and Gary Oldman gives a gloriously over-the-top performance as unhinged antagonist. The direction and editing are flawless.Reno's hitman and Portman's survivor develop a relationship which he initially views as paternalistic and which she eventually views as romantic. This is where the movie treads very close to the vile and indefensible; and while it thankfully never entirely crosses that line it never entirely walks back its implications either. One has to wonder exactly what the hell the filmmakers were thinking, since an entirely platonic surrogate father/daughter relationship would have served the story just as well. The fun revenge/action story is totally undercut by the inclusion of this one bizarre, unnecessary and nauseating subplot.And for those who think the foregoing is just some pearl-clutching, ""reading too much into it"" hyperbole, bear in mind: when this movie was made writer/director Luc Besson was 34 and he was married to a 16-year-old-girl, who he met when she was 12. But they allegedly didn't start dating until she was 15 (and he was 33.) Because apparently 15 is the age of consent in France, and disgusting everywhere else. Odd how these facts rarely get mentioned by sickos in sicko Hollywood's captive media when discussing this movie particularly or Besson in general. But the info is right there on Wikipedia for anyone who wants to spend more than 0 seconds looking into it."

IloveHanks,"Jul 7, 2010",7/10,"This movie reaches the heights of predictability that any action movie can possibly get.It is good but is so so so overrated. I will definitely say that it is easily the most overrated movie in IMDb.I could guess its climax in the first 15 minutes of the movie. The action in the movie is very well done. The saving grace is definitely the climax,the ending is superb and really redeems the movie, which otherwise could have been dull and insignificant.The casting consists of Jean reno and Natalie Portman. Natalie Portman is a 12 year old precocious child who has an immature love for Jean Reno who happens to be a Hit-man. After her entire family gets knocked out by Gary Oldman, he takes her into his wings and teaches her the secrets behind becoming a hit-man or say a hit-girl rather. Amongst the performances only Portman 's worth watching.. Gary Oldman is disappointing so is Jean Reno.The movie fails mainly because of its poor character development. The characters are very superficial especially Gary Oldman's character. You are left wondering why they are doing what they are doing.Overall as i said IT IS HUGELY OVERRATED.....I would give it7.2\10.."
ioanclashroyale,"Aug 17, 2021",1/10,I don't get this film. A 12-year old girl in love with a grown-up man? Is sick.Why so many people liked this movie?
Scubadudei,"Nov 8, 2013",10/10,"A great movie, Jean Reno and Luc Besson make a great team. The story is well written and the acting is superb. One of my favorite films. The interaction between Leon and Matilda is so well scripted and acted. Gary Oldman is a genius and is scary in his playing the part of a drug addled Police Detective. Danny Aleio is convincing in his caring for Leon. The action sequences are very realistic and not gratuitous. You get a real feel for the city and all its gritty inhabitants, strange that a Frenchman would make one of the best NYC films. The neighborhoods of Manhattan used are wonderful. Natalie Portman is excellent playing a Lolita type character who causes all kinds of problems for Leon."
georgess97,"Apr 25, 2014",10/10,"Reno's performance of hangdog loyalty lends his character pleasing sympathy while Besson's heavily stylized direction builds tension around sexy violence. Luc Besson is a masterly director of stylish, thrilling, and humorous action set pieces. You'll enjoy the action, but you'll remember the movie because of Reno and Portman. Leon (The Professional) is quite possibly the finest work by director Luc Besson.There's conviction in this movie, and intelligence. Besson's incomparable film is almost impossible to beat and there's yet to be a director who could match his magnum opus. Even after twenty years, ""Leon: The Professional"" stands as the superlative masterpiece of action filmmaking and has yet to be matched or toppled by any director in the business."
sdalligan,"Feb 9, 2017",10/10,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is one of the best films i've had the pleasure of watching. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year- old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."

Do not even think about it just watch it and you will agree with me.
gavin6942,"Nov 21, 2014",9/10,"Mathilda Lando (Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl, who is reluctantly taken in by Léon Montana (Jean Reno), a professional assassin, after her family is murdered. Léon and Mathilda form an unusual relationship, as she becomes his protégée and learns the assassin's trade.This is what you get if you take ""Lolita"" (sort of) and put it in the middle of a world with mobsters and hit men. And then casting for perfect actors? Priceless. Luc Besson probably had no idea that Portman would go on to be the international sensation she has become.Of course, we also have a solid performance from the always-impeccable Gary Oldman. Very few actors are working on his level. Maybe Daniel Day-Lewis, possibly Christian Bale. But Gary Oldman can be anyone and delivers 100% every time.Roger Ebert gave the film only two-and-a-half stars out of four, writing, ""Always at the back of my mind was the troubled thought that there was something wrong about placing a 12-year-old character in the middle of this action... In what is essentially an exercise—a slick urban thriller—it seems to exploit the youth of the girl without really dealing with it."" Not to disregard his concern, but time seems to be against Ebert here. The film has steadily gone up in praise over the years, possibly due to Portman's rising star."
CinemaClown,"Mar 19, 2018",N/A,"A vicious, violent & vengeful delight that grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments and doesn't let go until the very end, Léon remains one of the finest examples of 90s action cinema that's yet to lose any of its potency and can still rival the best of what its genre has to offer today."
gbill-74877,"Sep 4, 2021",6/10,"Natalie Portman is absolutely wonderful in this film, and her acting ability is truly impressive for a 13 year old. She's definitely the reason to watch it. The rest of the action film was slick and somewhat entertaining, but it felt like standard Hollywood fare, and didn't interest me nearly as much. Not a lot of it felt authentic and the dialogue was poorly written. I also think director Luc Besson sexualized Portman's character in places he didn't need to, giving the film a creepy feeling that's hard to get past."
androctonus-543-123383,"Jun 12, 2010",10/10,"Truly, I am not at all the kind of person who would advocate the French' self-concept. Anyway I must admit the Marseillaise is the one and only anthem that deserves being called 'anthem'. The Marseillaise is the anthem per se. And Léon is the movie per se. How else could a virile man happen to start crying watching an action movie? How else could a sophisticated man fall in love with a child? Or a tantalized pacifist's soul feel itself falling into murderous frenzy? With the means of his cinematic language Luc Besson sneaks under our skin, ignoring any mental or emotional barriers. During the movie our eyes our not the window to peek at our soul but the gateway to enter it. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and the Dieffenbachia realize the story so frankly and straightforward that the brilliance of the story completely blends into the authenticity of the impression. I face a work and do not dare speak a word about it. It is. Léon is the Movie."
SnoopyStyle,"Aug 7, 2014",8/10,"Léon (Jean Reno) is a milk-drinking illiterate hit-man for Italian mob boss Uncle Tony (Danny Aiello) in NYC with his favorite plant. His next door neighbor 12 year old Mathilda (Natalie Portman) has an abusive father (Michael Badalucco) who skimmed drugs off of Stansfield (Gary Oldman). Stansfield massacres the family. She comes home to find Stansfield's men still there. She fakes and walks over to Léon's. It turns out that they are corrupt DEA agents. Léon the cleaner reluctantly lets her in and she badgers him to teach her. She seeks revenge on his little brother's murderers.Director Luc Besson brings his often collaborator Jean Reno to America and makes a nice discovery with a young Natalie Portman. Before Hit-Girl, there was Mathilda. Gary Oldman is a superb strange bad guy. Luc Besson has a certain French flair with his action. He really has a unique take on the action thriller genre. It definitely has an edgy violent style that sometimes sexualized the young Portman. She takes on a lot of adult tendencies. That probably held it back a little back in the day."
Marcus-Aurelius90,"Feb 5, 2016",N/A,"This is really two films in one. Let me explain.A movie was released in 1994 called ""The Professional"". Two years later a longer version with an additional 25 minutes appeared. This was called the International version. The shorter original version is what director Luc Besson refers to as his directors cut. Both are English language, but have a very strong French influence. Lovers of European crime films and thrillers will love this film.Both version are modern crime classics, inspired by a medieval French ballad about a knight that was in danger of losing his land through battle, until he mounts one last heroic effort and with a blood curdling battle cry (as seen in the end of the film) he hurls himself once more at the enemy and wins the day. This is one of the many spiritually profound things in this film that lift it from a generic crime film, augmented by a timeless soundtrack by Eric Serra.The plot: A lethal foreign hit-man befriends a young girl after sparing her from the same bloody fate that befalls her family, gunned down by a vicious corrupt cop and his merry band of killers. One of whom in real life would later die on September 11 (he played ""Benny"").The young girl is Mathilda (Natalie Portman in a very early role). Mathilda demands to stay with her savior, the recalcitrant hermit hit-man, Leon. This sets up a nice role reversal. The older Man should be the one that calls the shots, but he's a helpless foreigner that cannot read English and so it falls to the younger vivacious Matilda to save him right back.The socially awkward man child Leon wears ill fitting clothes made for a teenager not an adult. He really is just half a man. He spends his time between hits drinking enough milk to raise a brood of orphans, just in case the child motif wasn't established enough already. He also trains and trains his body and mind to be the sort of lethal weapon that negates the need to fully integrate into this new foreign world. Half man half child.Leon is bewildered by Matilda and doesn't know how to handle her. Mathilda eventually becomes infatuated with Leon, mistaking his paternal protective mechanism as mutual love. Some Narrow minded film critics see more to that than what it is.As soon as Matilda realizes what Leon does for a living, she demands that he teach her how to kill, hoping to learn the skills required to get revenge on those that made her an orphan. Leon flatly refuses. He also rejects her naive romantic overtures. Ashamed and rejected She runs off alone toward a bloody showdown with the corrupt cop Stansfield (Gary Oldman in his psychotically brilliant career defining role), who murdered her entire family at the start.Talk of a sequel has been bubbling along for years. Director Luc Besson has written a screenplay, but having left Gaumont (the company that produced this film) it appears they are withholding the screenplay from him as well as the rights to make said sequel, so it may never happen."
hillbillycam,"Aug 17, 2025",8/10,"Any film that has me barracking for a hired killer has to be pretty well acted and directed with a very good story. Jean Reno is fantastic in this role. He is entirely believable as a stone cold elite killer, yet what makes him sympathetic is his ability to convey a wounded soul who is able to rediscover love (not the romantic kind, but a fatherly kind).Natalie Portman is also incredible, the only caveat I have is that it is a little creepy for a 13 yo to be expressing romantic feelings for an adult. It would have worked better, and aged far better if her feelings were of the daughter needing and finding a father figure kind of emotions. And if Leon had clearly emoted to Mathilda that his feelings were clearly of the father daughter kind. As others have noted, his love is, concerningly, a little too ambiguously represented.Oldman is either brilliant or over the top, depending on where you sit. I enjoyed his performance, even if the other 2 were more believable.The plot, storyline is refreshingly simple and well paced. Unlike so many action/thrillers that try to be clever and end up instead coming across as contrived or convoluted, this film doesn't ask too much of the audience, and doesn't suffer from implausible plot holesHighly recommended... it makes me wonder what a young Luc Besson would've done with a Daniel Craig Bond film.. something far superior to all that followed Casino Royale, I suspect."
bothworld,"Apr 14, 2025",9/10,"Is a gripping and emotional action-drama that blends stylized violence with unexpected tenderness. Jean Reno delivers a standout performance as Léon, a solitary hitman whose quiet life is upended by a troubled young girl, played brilliantly by Natalie Portman in her breakout role.Their bond is unusual but deeply human, creating a unique dynamic that drives the film. The direction by Luc Besson is slick and moody, with a strong European flair, and Gary Oldman's intense and unpredictable role adds serious edge to the story.The film balances gunfire with soul, making it more than just a typical action flick. Honestly, the characters feel so alive that it leaves you wanting to explore their past and future.A prequel exploring Léon's origins or a sequel following the aftermath would definitely hit the spot."
mjl1966,"Oct 23, 2021",10/10,"Despite Ms. Portman later feeling uncomfortable about her role in this film, her portrayal of a violently orphaned 13-year-old is nothing short of astonishing.After her dysfunctional family is killed by a rogue DEA agent and his cadre, young Mathilda seeks refuge with the affable hit-man living just down the hall. As she rings the doorbell, she breaks down and starts crying as it finally hits her that her little brother has just been brutally murdered.And so begins a relationship of revenge, healing and mutual affection between two very lonely people. Besson pulls no punches in revealing Mathilda's emerging sexuality as Mathilda begins to fall in love with her reluctant guardian. But unlike the misadventures of an older man and young temptress from Nabokov, the relationship here isn't seedy, cynical or perverse. It is actually quite poignant as the simple-minded hit-man quietly contains Mathilda's amorous advances without withdrawing from her. He is genuinely fond of her and this is beautifully played out by Jean Ruso as he protects and guides, as best as a hit-man can, his protégé.Ultimately, this is a love story between two people who can't have each other yet still protect each other in ways both dramatic and sublime. The love is awkward, clumsy and naïve in a gritty and tender way all at the same time. But it is genuine and heart-felt. Very few directors would be able to pull off this kind of story, so this is a bit of a gem -- I don't think we'll ever see anything quite like this again.I just love this story and Mathilda is one of my all-time favorite characters. Natalie brings a sublimely powerful performance to the screen that you will remember for a long time.I'm just sorry that she isn't proud of it. She should be. It's a powerful story. Yes, Mathilda is sexualized, but her character, as portrayed by Portman, is so much more than that. We get that. Honest, we really do."

kubakolbert,"Sep 21, 2025",8/10,Eventhough Léon is an action film it grasps you when you expected at least. In romance. In the sentimental scenes in which we are presented this vague relationship between Reno and Portman. The beautiful contrast between how Matilda is trying to explore her cold bloded and sexual part of herself and how Leon is re-experiencing his emotions and childhood always leaves the audience in a tense situation in which we don't if something will happen between them. Great pick.
sirmoon,"Sep 25, 2017",N/A,"I have seen this movie more than five times and it never fails to entertain. All the acting is incredible Which is especially notable since Natalie Portman was only 11 at the time.

To fully enjoy this movie YOU MUST watch the Directors cut."

I don't mind I good movie with a good actors but this movie was actually very difficult to watch.
I been thinking through out the movie how young Matilda is ,it was really creepy and uncomfortable.
It was basically a love story between a grown man and a little girl a more edgy version of lolita, not my cup of tea."
Eva07m,"Sep 11, 2025",10/10,"I really love the movie bc I relate to it on personal level. As a child I was like the girl Mathilda. My parents were always busy with their own things. And my sister was doing her own stuff too. A sniper and a little girl who became like a family. Sad ending tho! #1 Movie in my life!

It felt like the movie was trying to sexualize a child in a subtle yet weird way. It caught me off guard for some of the film and definitely took away some points in my book. There where very creepy moments between the 12 year old and a grown man this movie is a 8 but i have to dock it points. I shouldn't feel that way watching a film and it's just me its a-lot of people. Even the actor her self felt sexualized. Very weird, but an excellent thriller."

Are u guys kidding me? This movie is just outrageous! The plot is completely stupid, the pacing is slow, the characters seem to come out directly from a comic book (particularly Gary Oldman's one who is simply laughable) and the action scenes are not good at all! Have any of you guys watched any real action movie lately? because this one clearly is not! To make things even worse the director decided to make the entire movie revolve around the sentimental and sexual tension between a killer and a 12 years old girl! And what is incredible is that everybody seems to be ok about it!
I will stop trusting reviews around here, because they're evidently written by incompetents. This movie should be among the list of the 250 WORST movies of all time!"
sinakazemi-74507,"Oct 5, 2024",10/10,"Léon: The Professional is a rare film that strikes a perfect balance between intense action and heartfelt emotion. From start to finish, it captivated me with its unique blend of thriller elements and a deeply personal story about unlikely relationships.Jean Reno's portrayal of Léon, a hitman with a quiet yet powerful presence, is nothing short of iconic. His silent strength contrasts beautifully with the vulnerability of Mathilda, played masterfully by a young Natalie Portman. The chemistry between the two characters is what drives the film, making their bond both heart-wrenching and uplifting.Gary Oldman as the psychotic antagonist is unforgettable, delivering one of the most chilling performances in film history. His unpredictable, manic energy creates tension in every scene he's in, elevating the stakes to an entirely new level.What I love most about Léon is its ability to mix genres effortlessly-there are moments of high-octane action, but also scenes of quiet tenderness and moral complexity. The cinematography, direction by Luc Besson, and hauntingly beautiful score by Éric Serra all come together to create a film that is both visually and emotionally striking."
mcdflint,"Sep 1, 2021",10/10,"Get Luc Besson to write a story and then direct it on the screen; get Jean Reno and Gary Oldman to star, throw in a devastating performance from a TWELVE year old Natalie Portman, add a pinch of a bevy of supporting players who are all stars in their own rights and you have the recipe for one of the best films ever made. And the music was superb along with the cinematography: it is one of those films where every frame is an award winning photograph to hang on the wall. If you do get to see it then be warned: set aside a couple oh hours every few months to sit and be re-amazed!"
fadetoblack0889,"Dec 16, 2008",10/10,"Absolutely loved every bit of it. A true classic surprisingly underrated and overlooked in history. It is in full swing every way you look at it, it’s flawless. I call it perfection. The pinnacle of Luc Besson film-making career. Direction was superb as well as the soundtracks and scores (by Eric Serra). The scores was one of the pivotal element of the movie which add to the depth and dense atmosphere to the movie. Besides the movie is highly stylish and original. All these finishes off with one of the greatest, breath taking ending to a movie I’ve ever seen and that without using excessive special effects.The movie carefully drew the picture of the characters in the opening 25 min. In the art of killing, Léon is a Pro. But in real life, he is a loner. Like DeNiro in Taxi Driver. His best friend is his plant. Deep down, he is a child. He is mentally slow and do not know how to read nor write. Then there is Mathilda, a 12 years old girl who lives in a dysfunctional family, on the verge of committing suicide. She has endured the hardships of life that had made her mature at her young age. Her entire family was wiped out by a corrupt DEA Officer and his men because of drug problems. She had no other place to turn to except his next door neighbor, Léon.Then the tone of the movie changes completely which breaks the stereotypes of other action movies. This is where the movie caught me by surprise. I thought it will become just another boring movie and how wrong was I! Prepare yourself for awesomeness! This is something I never experienced before in any other movie. It was that exceptional. The way it’s constructed & layered or in short put together was a work of genius. Arty like. There was this fascination and perfect chemistry between the two characters. It looked so freaking real and deep that you are taken away in the skin of the characters.The cast & acting was perfect:Luc Besson wrote the script with Jean Reno as Léon in mind and no one else. The role was crafted for him and he delivers the goods. He played on his facial expressions more than words actually throughout the movie. He portrayed the character as exactly Luc wished it to be. This is his breakthrough and famous movie.Nathalie Portman was so versatile in her role as Mathilda. She pulled up into a complex and difficult role. She was wonderful and prolific considering her age (12). She shifted between different moods seamlessly (An uncontrollable burst of laughter in the Restaurant scene and a burst of tears in the ending moments of the movie). She is lovable, cute, touching and has a lovely innocent voice. Still her best acting to date.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played. You will love to hate him. I won’t hesitate to say that he was on par with the great Heath Ledger’s Joker. His lines were a killer. He’s acting was scary and funny at the same time. He's a freak. He is definitely amazing. Danny Aiello role as Tony was excellent in a minor role.Verdict: 10/10.Perfect. Memorable. Repeated viewings recommended & watch the uncut edition to enjoy the true potential of the movie. It still holds as my favorite movie after 14 years of existence. Never gets old. Glad to see it is gaining its due respect with time and still climbing the ladder in IMDb Top 250 ;)"
dbacke1,"Feb 17, 2010",10/10,"This film, released in 1994, still rates right up there with the top films of the action genre, and it seems like it hasn't aged a bit. I happened to catch this one the other night on a pay channel, and it was right after Matilda's family gets killed. I was immediately glued to it, even though I have seen it a few times before. It is a riveting and suspenseful film, and it scores in all departments. The style and pacing are second to none. Natalie Portman gave us a preview of her brilliance in this film, and she gives an excellent performance that I think would have been Oscar-worthy if the film had received more attention when it was first released. Jean Reno redefines the ruggedly handsome action hero, and he is perfect in the role of Leon. Gary Oldman is over the top, but so is his character, and he nails it all the way. Danny Aiello is solid as usual, and all of the supporting performances are spot on. Director Luc Besson set the standard with this film that others have sadly been unable to achieve. They need to, because it's films like this one that make movie watching the truly rewarding experience that it should be. This is for Matilda!!!"
godzigodzigodzi,"Oct 27, 2019",6/10,"I'm a sucker for action drama genre, so in general i love this movie. the plot made sense, storyline wasn't predictable. the action scenes give me good goosebumps. I see them as a sadistic father-daughter duo... until Mathilda mentioned wanting to have sex with him.So I enjoyed the movie, but everytime the movie serves you this awkward sexual tension between 12-year-old Mathilda and a really old man, I feel extremely uncomfortable.i think if Mathilda is a bit older or Leon is a bit younger, the falling-in-love part wont bother me as much"
bdcrawley,"Jan 6, 2014",2/10,"It actually started out well with some decent action scenes and seemed promising at first but shifted into a boring plot with some ridiculous action scenes and some really awkward scenes of sexual tension between Leon and Matilda, although I understand these were removed from the North American version of the movie... gee, wonder why? Normally that wouldn't have been an issue if she wasn't 12 and he looked like he was in his 50's.I am very shocked to see this movie on the top 250 list on IMDb. This movie was honestly one of the most terrible movies I've seen in the last 5 years. There's a lot of movies on this list that should have been in its place.

jpt-55594,"Sep 25, 2017",10/10,"I remember watching this movie when i was young. It was one of those movies that I could watch everyday after school. The action was thrilling and I always wanted to be like Leon, a stone cold bad ass with a heart.About 20 years after I first saw The Professional I watched it again and it was awesome. It was awesome not because of the nostalgic feeling but because it is a movie that has stood the test of time. Its formula is simple but yet captivating. This is not your typical action movie of a buff guy of a pretty action star that was the norm in the early 90's but the protagonist is someone that is unassuming that epitomises the term ""silent killer"". Gary Oldman gives a masterclass performance as the main antagonist and Natalie Portman gives a performance that makes one question is she was truly a teenager or if she was older. The plot is intriguing and the pacing keeps you engaged, the stunts are believable and the action sequences will put modern movies to shame. The music is incredible and the characters have depth and humanized.Without giving out any spoilers this is a film that works in every perceivable way. An A+ for me"
oephyx,"Feb 20, 2006",10/10,"Luc Besson's Leon is blessed with so many qualities that it not only excels in its crime-thriller genre but also in the general art of cinematography.The french director stays simple in his brilliance, to deliver an intense but deeply human thriller. Filming is subtle and intelligent, with discreet special effects that give the movie a feel a realism. The composition is tight : the 110 minutes leave time to deliver a good plot, generous action and excellent character development.This is achieved by the excellent actors portraying the three main characters. Gary Oldman expertly becomes the butchery obsessed, corrupt DEA agent. Natalie Portman is a revelation playing 12 year-old Mathilda. She shows the complexity of a strong charactered abandoned girl in a seemingly effortless performance. Jean Reno is extraordinary as Leon, the killer who lives a life of paradox, between the violence of his employment and his apparent naivety. The unlikely formation of a link between the two latter characters is the heart of the movie, where the young girl gives Leon a taste of life.Leon is an exceptional film : combining suspense and drama, subtleness and brilliance, Luc Besson signs a masterful jewel of cinematography."
alien_lover47,"Jul 5, 2004",N/A,"I was in Wal-Mart yesterday looking through DVDs when I came across a movie I had seen several times on television, ""The Professional."" It was on the night before and I had to get it. I love this movie. Every character in it is an individual. When I told my mother and sister what the movie was about they looked at me with a look on their face that said ""He's a hit-man. He's--a--hit-man."" Who said hit men can't have a soul? This one does. The detail of character in this movie is stunning. It has no shame either, and proudly displays images and moments with the raw truth. This little girl does bleed, she does see violence and filth, she does smoke cigarettes and gets slapped by her father. She has no sorrow for her dead and useless family, only her innocent little brother. A hit-man is her idol because he showed her kindness, he did more for her than her family ever did.Leon himself is a great guy. I found myself wanting to be like him at some points. Even though he is a killer, the man has morals. He has more morals than anyone in any other action movie with explosions and such that I've ever seen. He's very swift on his feet and even though he seems like a very serious person, he can laugh and grin a large smile. The character is just so natural, so graceful in acting. Like I said, detail is shown very well in this movie. Ooh, my favorite though...OH, MY FAVORITE...!...Is Gary Oldman's character, Stansfield. I LOVE him! The moment he comes onto the screen my face lights up like cigarette :). I was actually attracted to him because of his character....Ooh, so deliciously evil! He delivers comedy and cruelty all in one, and he holds that gun so well! I loved how close he got to people. To tell you the truth, it made me a little uncomfortable, haha. But he got so close to Mathilda. Just him and her, and he's poking a gun right in her face. It just goes to show how merciless and serious he can be. I was happy to see the extra scene they cut out from TV right afterward when Willie comes in and interrupts and he's deciding what to do with her.Stansfield is so strange and shifty, he motions to her awkwardly with the gun to come with them, but then suddenly points it at her and takes aim, but then just thinks to himself ""forget it"" and puts his arm down. Great character. The storyline itself is good too. No one is afraid to talk about/do things that a lot of other movies won't do. They don't censor out what makes people seem real. They give a 12 year old knowledge she shouldn't know and ways of acting that most parents would shudder at. The hit-man is human and considers what he does a job and when he's not doing his job he's a very decent human being. The villain is a little wacky, but he pulls it off very nicely. He fits the part of a psycho perfectly. The lines in the movie can be catchy and touching, little moments make it all worthwhile. The scene where she walks past her dead family and up to Leon's door is so amazing. She's crying helplessly for him to open the door. I mean, you really can see it in her eyes that she's begging. Wonderful acting, especially for such a young actress. It amazes me how well she does with adults, right in her face too, and all the adult related topics too that she deals with. Anyway, I wish I could write more passionately and interestingly as do a lot of people who write comments, but I just don't think I have a large enough vocabulary. This movie is not easy to explain in words for me. I can only sum it up as ""Unique, inspiring (the whole hit-man thing...), amazing, conscious, dramatic, wonderfully acted, and talented."" Well, those words poppped into my head. I could say more, but I don't know how."
gadagast,"Mar 3, 2021",7/10,"Ok, so this is a pretty compelling action-y thriller in the same vein as Drive (2011) for something contemporary and comparable. Good performances by all the leads and especially Gary Oldman for selling how bonkers Stanfield is. My main complaint is how Natalie Portman is shot and written to be a sort of temptress and while I understand it's supposed to make you uncomfortable, it pushes it enough to really make you raise your eyebrows and wonder what were they thinking."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 21, 2024",10/10,"In the shadowy corners of cinema, few films resonate with the raw intensity and emotional depth of ""Leon: The Professional."" Directed by Luc Besson, this cult classic is not just a film; it's a beautifully crafted dichotomy of tenderness and violence that leaves an indelible mark on its viewers.At the heart of the movie is Leon, played to perfection by Jean Reno. He's a hitman with a heart, navigating a life mired in the grim underbelly of New York City. His world is a symphony of sleek, efficient brutality-one where each job is meticulously executed with precision. But when he inadvertently becomes the guardian of Matilda, a young girl played by the fierce and captivating Natalie Portman in her break-out role, his life takes a haunting turn. The bond they develop amidst chaos is both unconventional and heartbreaking, transforming Léon from a solitary assassin into a reluctant father figure, highlighting the fragility of innocence in a world filled with darkness.Portman's performance is nothing short of mesmerizing. As Matilda, she embodies a mix of vulnerability and fierce determination, showcasing a complexity rarely seen in child actors. Their relationship is both beautiful and problematic, layered with emotional turmoil that challenges societal norms and perceptions of morality. It walks the tightrope between love and an unsettling darkness, making viewers grapple with their feelings toward the characters.Besson's direction is an artful spectacle-the cinematography creates a palpable tension, each frame dripping with atmosphere. The film is punctuated by moments of explosive action balanced with quieter, poignant scenes that linger long after each sequence. The soundscape complements the visuals, with a haunting score that captures the essence of the characters' tumultuous journey.""Leon: The Professional"" also serves as a commentary on the nature of violence and redemption. It poses difficult questions about love and loyalty in an unforgiving world, challenging viewers to consider the lines between villain and hero. The morally ambiguous world of Léon is a tapestry of stark contrasts, where love can flourish in the most unexpected places, and life can be fleeting and brutal.""Leon: The Professional"" is a tour de force that transcends genres. It's a film that juxtaposes the innocence of childhood against the cold realities of adulthood, inviting viewers to explore the depths of human emotion in the process. With unforgettable performances, masterful direction, and a haunting narrative, this film remains a badass testament to the power of cinema, proving that sometimes, the most beautiful stories are born from chaos. This is a film that lingers in the mind and heart, a sophisticated dance between life, death, and everything that exists between them."
pascal-101,"Dec 12, 2021",1/10,"Plot makes no sense - a drug dealer shoots up a whole family including a 4 year old boy (seriously disturbing scene) just to get back 10% of a cocaine shipment from a small time carrier : why risk such a high profile homicide case for such a small issue? Natalie Portman character is a 12 year old girl that is portrayed in a sexual way from the first time you see her. Stopped watching when she answers the hotel concierge where they are staying asking about what her das does, ""he's not my dad, he's my lover"". Cheap shock value directing delving into pedophelia."
JessyCritical,"Nov 18, 2010",9/10,"Luc Besson, director of La Femme Nikita, introduces us to the kind- hearted assassin Leon, in this tense thriller. After her family is killed by the corrupt Government Official Stansfield (Gary Oldman) the young Mathilda (Natalie Portman) is befriended by Leon. Determined to be taught how to 'clean' and desperate to avenge her young brother's death, Mathilda takes on a deadly new life. Leon, played by Jean Reno, is one of those character's you can't help but love. His goofy appearance and quirky behaviour contrast perfectly with his lethal career choice. Despite being unable to read, Leon loves a good film. The scene where he is watching 'Singin' in the Rain' shows us that he just a child inside. Also, during Mathilda's game he is only able to recognise Gene Kelly. Natalie Portman, also, gives a wonderful performance as the 12 year-old Mathilda and it's clear to see why she began to star in other films quite soon after this: Heat, Mars Attacks! etc. Portman has to portray a lot of emotion in this film and she does it with such ease. You instantly feel for her and the situation she's been put in. However, it does become clear that the tough-girl attitude she acquires is just a front, all she wants is to be loved. Perhaps seeking it from a professional assassin, who is a fair bit older than you, is not the best idea; but it is believable and understandable in this film. Gary Oldman as the villain, Stansfield, is brilliant. With lines like, ""I haven't got time for this mickey mouse bullsh*t,"" he was born for roles like this one. His performance is completely believable and you'll love to hate him. He, also, is an odd character: the weird way he takes his pills is nothing short of disturbing. The music used in Leon is another thing that needs applauding. Suspense is easily created and there are many times where you'll want to hold your breath until the scene is over. The soft music adds even more emotion and charm, making the film quite beautiful. So, overall, I really enjoyed this film and could easily watch it again and again. It's another of those films that will stay with you long after you've seen it. Even though it was made 16 years ago, nothing in this genre comes close to being as good."
sammy105,"May 30, 2007",10/10,"This movie simply put is a cinematic masterpiece. Rarely does a movie get me to... practically sob unstoppably almost from beginning to end, but this one did. Every detail is licked, the music not only flows along with every moment, but adds a good deal of content all on its own.Luc Besson, unlike most directors nowadays it seems, has an excellent take on child phychology, right up there with Stephen King himself. A child is shown here not as a fragile creature in need of constant looking over by adults, but more like a member of a society like any other red-blooded American. The fact that kids are susceptible to practically all the dangers that adults are today is portrayed in the movie very well.The movie does not have scenes that attract attention by asking the actors show weakness, to cry, to express feelings with words, but everything is done in situations, music, and cinematic tricks of different kinds.This is not a movie to make one feel gooey and tender on the inside, but rather to provoke a spurt of emotion that hides inside every one of us. Not the kind that's felt by watching a romance flick. This is something different. Modern movie makers have quite a few things to learn from Besson. Movies like this one can change our skewed outlook on life and... make us born again."
beauryker-623-466161,"Apr 8, 2011",10/10,"This movie is a classic, and I think Besson's best film by far. The casting is perfect, the relationship between Leon and Mathilda is both sweet and heartbreaking. After seeing, actually during, this film I knew little Natalie was on her way. Such a natural presence and delivery is a rare thing. It's as if she had been living this part for her whole 11 yrs. And Reno gave us his best role ever. The King of Badguys has played many great characters, but Oldman is on fire here. The guy could be the best villain to ever hit the screen. I think back to some of his bad guys he's played, and those movies wouldn't be the same if he wasn't a part of them. The soundtrack is also tremendous, and the closing song by Sting really defined the whole film. I have nothing bad to say about this film, and would have done nothing different. Luc needs to get part II started fast! The story lines are endless. Just noticed that Natalie Portman has two 8.6 IMDb scores with Leon and Black Swan. Not too shabby in this day and age"
TxMike,"Jun 28, 2002",N/A,"Updated February 2020: A very intriguing, action-packed 2 hours and 11 minutes. I was bothered a bit by the same thing that bothered Ebert's accurate review, namely the idea of a young girl aspiring to be a ""cleaner"" like the man she adopts after her parents and siblings are killed by a rogue cop when a drug deal goes bad. Also the implied relationship the young girl sought, telling the hotel clerk ""he's not really my father, he's my lover."" Or the circuitous discussion of whether first-time sex is enjoyable, or the scene where she tells him to sleep next to her in the bed. This character is not a little teddy-bear hugging child, but a mature 12-year-old who wants to have a relationship with the older man, no matter how absurd it seems. Probably the French influence.However, all that aside, ""Leon"" is an entertaining and action-packed film. This was Natalie Portman's (Mathilda) first film role, two years before her smart performance in ""Beautiful Girls"", and she is quite remarkable. Gary Oldman is his usual crazy self. Jean Reno is cool as the hit man, a role that fits his image perfectly.The opening scenes, where Leon is hired to ""advise"" a man to stay out of NYC, is one of the best I have seen in any movie and establishes Leon's profession and skill set. And of course the closing OTT action. But the vast middle of the story is a non-sexual love story between Mathilda and Leon, something that neither had experienced before.I initially saw it on DVD, then more recently purchased the BluRay version which has an enhanced soundtrack, especially with inclusion of some really deep bass at appropriate places to heighten the tension. This is one of my favorite re-watches, I've probably watched it more than a dozen times. The BluRay disc also has a set of interesting extras, including actors reflecting on the experience of making Leon."
abu3mer,"Mar 4, 2024",6/10,"I'm not sure if this movie isn't good or if it is just too old. However, I watched so many good movies that were produced in the 90s. I dont think this movie is bad but It is overrated. Heard so many people saying that this was one of their favorite movies, I have no idea how on earth this could be on anyone's favorite list. It has a nice story and great acting but it is not a top movie. This would be a great short movie or something like that but these high ratings are really misleading. Don't get me wrong the acting and directing were amazing but the story itself was so poor, it lacked main stories and it felt a bit silly."
swiftymcveigh187,"Aug 11, 2004",10/10,"When I first saw this movie on TBS it captivated me. How could such an excellent assassin befriend a little wafe girl like Mathilda? And more so how could she love a heartless killer? In actually watching the full length International Uncut Version (Version Integrale) many times over, I feel that I've come to understand Leon's plight, and the love that he feels for the child that he takes in.Leon - The Professional is beautiful. The film, in its gritty, dark, back room kind of feel moves those who watch it. Its almost like seeing a baby born, as you will see both main characters (Mathilda and Leon) be almost reborn into the world with something that they've never experienced before: binding love.This sounds sappy, and frankly if I had read this I would think that it was a pitiful cliché. It's not. Take it for what it is--a beautiful, moving film. You cannot grasp its depth until you experience it in full."
TimelessFlight,"Jul 27, 2023",7/10,"This is a cracking good film with a few uncomfortable moments. An oddball story well told in short, sharp style.Leon is a hired hitman (aka 'cleaner'). He is uber cool and clinical in his work. He also does his own ironing, drinks milk, and has an obsessive love for a pot plant.His path crosses with a 12 year old girl, Mathilda, and when she becomes orphaned Matilda decides to adopt Leon as her guardian, hero and assassin trainer.It's a mad plot which shouldn't work, but somehow it does. Largely this is thanks to the terrific performance of Jean Reno, who is utterly convincing as hitman Leon; he's tough, soft hearted, dangerous, vulnerable, ruthless and likeable all in one. Perfect casting.A young Natalie Portman gives a fine performance too as the clingy but head strong Mathilda.Throw into the mix a deliciously OTT performance from Gary Oldman as Stansfield, the deranged and corrupt drug enforcement agent who ultimately comes into violent conflict with Leon & Mathilda, and you have the perfect villain too.This is a violent film, and at times overly macho, that doesn't quite land its tender moments as easily as it does its excellent action scenes. The relationship between Leon and Mathilda is entirely fine when based on sentiment or pseudo parental love, but does occasionally flirt with something more troublingly sexual. The 'dress up' scenes where Mathilda takes on adult characters - although hopefully intended to be playful - are cringingly wrong, and the film would be much finer for ridding itself of any hint of sexualising a 12 year old girl.Put those uneasy troubles aside (if you can), and its thoroughly enjoyable."
Cmsanghv,"Apr 8, 2014",1/10,"This movie is a good example of the pitfalls of relying on user reviews/ ratings for selecting movies to watch. By no stretch of imagination should this movie have been in the Top 250 list or anywhere even close to it.The acting and direction were poor, the story very lacklustre, unimaginative and predictable and many of the scenes were downright ludicrous.Leon appears retarded in many scenes but an attempt is made to depict him as an intelligent person.Some of the scenes will require you to suspend disbelief - one of them being a rocket launcher being fired at an apartment from inside the building by cops!"
mstomaso,"Jul 24, 2007",10/10,"Luc Besson's ""Leon"" AKA ""The Professional"" ranks in my top ten action films of all time, along with his ""La Femme Nikita"". The difference between Besson's films and standard action films is what Besson does with the rest of the story. His films feature intense character development and satisfying human plots. In both films, Besson's heroes are ruthless professional killers. Sympathy for Nikita develops because of her tragic struggle against her own history and psychology, while Leon's latent sense of justice, brought on by his innocent love for a 12 year old girl, makes this professional hit man truly heroic. Besson's action is over-the-top, wild and unrealistic, what makes his films so believable and so compelling is PSYCHOLOGICAL REALISM - a much more engaging aspect of film than violence will ever be. Quentin Tarantino could learn much through a close study of Besson (though I am sure he has already done this)Leon is played by Jean Reno. Reno is a charismatic, under-appreciated physical actor, and his performance is wonderful. Natalie Portman, in her early teens, gives an amazing performance as ""Mathilda"" the character around whom the entire story revolves. And Gary Oldman is masterful as the despicable Stansfield. Oldman has given us so many remarkable performances over the years, that it is difficult to identify his most profound parts, but this is certainly among his most memorable.Mathilda is a troubled young girl whose family - who she is not very fond of - is about to get wiped out over a drug dispute. Leon is a professional killer who lives down the hall. When Mathilda's family is wiped out, Leon - and you get the feeling that this is the first time he has allowed himself to feel sympathy is many years - takes her in. Thus begins the love story, and the story of revenge that will drive the film's major themes and its plot.The story is beautifully filmed and exquisitely paced - you will be unable to take your eyes from the screen. The soundtrack is also excellent and wholly unobtrusive. The action scenes are memorable, affective, and tastefully subordinate to the story (take note Quentin).Directing A+ Script A+ Acting A+ Story A+ Cinematography A+ Sound/Music A+Very highly recommended."
johnnyboyz,"Dec 5, 2008",10/10,"Léon is pure film-making, outstanding just as it is hypnotic just as it is out and out entertaining. Known as The Professional to others, Luc Besson's debut English language film captures the essence of evil on screen just as it does the potential hope other individuals may carry amidst all the gloom and depression in one of cinema's favourite down and out cities: New York. Why Léon is such an unrecognised film is quite bewildering  IMDb has it grossing a modest $19 Million dollars but it won two awards and garnered a few other nominations. Everyone likes a hero and most people like a story where two people (usually of opposite genders) connect in certain times of hardship amidst a locale of no hope  at its core, Léon could be seen as exactly this.The film is a tale of revenge, a love story and a crime drama complete with hit men, criminals, bent police men and innocent young girls caught up in the middle. The film presents to us how one event or one act of greed can act as a catalyst for bigger and nastier things, on a much larger scale than first intended and the film also brings a certain humane quality to worn out clichés and typical characters for the genre; like Tarantino and the Coen brothers at the height of their quality as seen in Pulp Fiction and Fargo respectively, this is Luc Besson stripping down the screen and delivering on a simplistic but immensely satisfying level.The ingredients work in Léon. At its heart, a vulnerable hero in Mathilda (Portman) who is established to be living in a 'world' that is less than perfect but is a hero whose life is changed by an outside, unseen event and must then realise this as a trigger for not only her desire for revenge, but the propulsion into the real world in which she will learn the skills she needs and generally mature. The idea, or formula, is best presented in the training montage Léon (Reno) himself and Mathilda partake in to a popular Björk song  it is the classic case of passing time to a montage to signify maturity and learning.But this is in no way a criticism as much as it is recognising and appreciating effectiveness. Mathilda's goal is to avenge the death of not her family as such, but her little brother who she deemed was innocent at merely eight or so years old. By this rational, her mother and sister were also innocent but Mathilda just doesn't appreciate them as much to avenge their deaths. The film's principal study begins with its hero on the verge of suicide, as a scene over the phone with a correctional institute tells us: Mathilda mimics her mother and tells the woman on the phone that Mathilda's death is the reason she hasn't been attending school. It is the low point of Mathilda's life and occurs just prior to the point of no return in which corrupt DEA officers blow away the rest of the family. The point of no return is signified beautifully as Mathilda walks past the wreckage of her apartment, gazing in slow motion, and rings the bell on Léon's door  the door opens and light fills the screen as she is accepted.The film actually fills up a lot of its time prior to this with Léon himself, not necessarily tricking the audience as to who the film will be about, but informing us of the type of person that awaits Mathilda. Indeed, the opening scenes or indeed shots of the camera towering over Central Park and down a New York street presents to us the location of New York in all its grimy glory as we delve deep within the heart of the city, all the time the tracking shots getting closer to ground level and all the time getting nearer to its destination, a café run by a man named Tony (Aiello). The first we see of Léon are his round sunglasses, creating a physical barrier between us, the audience, and the identity of this man whom downs glasses of milk in no time and talks casually about killing people for money.But the following scenes of Léon happy, enjoying himself and getting on with ironing and watering plants breaks off from stereotypical hit-man personas and gives us a different light. This leads to Léon's first encounter with Mathilda during which he tells her life is ""always like this"", this twinned with the fact we know she's potentially suicidal makes the audience uneasy. But, she seems jolly and happy when she goes to the store for Léon  she is out and about and doing something for someone else that she deems worthy of such attention, which will echo the understanding and the relationship they'll soon have. Incidentally, later on Tony's warning about change being 'a bad thing' and that Léon was in trouble before over a woman paints a potentially ominous picture.The villain of the piece is Norman Stansfield (Oldman) who is a very intimate and aggressive character and Oldman plays him in a way that suggests someone who could go from green to red or from calm to sociopathic in a matter of seconds. The fact he tells one of his men to tell the police that ""we were doing our job"" hints that the sort of prior violent activity is not unfamiliar to Stansfield and co. further creating a dangerous opinion of the characters in our minds  they are not to be messed with. Léon is a tale of a young protagonist having to learn the hard way and still not really being up to scratch; it is a hybrid of crime, drama, romance and tragedy that spirals out of control but remains dramatic and heart wrenching all the same  Besson has made few English language films but there will always be Léon."
luciejane010,"Feb 3, 2005",10/10,"I saw Leon 9 years ago and have never been so utterly gripped or moved by any other film since. Nathalie Portman as 'Mathilda' was mesmerising and Jean Leno has yet to excel in subsequent films, I always see him as 'Leon' (sad, yeah?) Is the uncut version only on DVD or is there a US version that someone is keeping secret from me? If so, where can I get a copy? Also, is there a soundtrack available? only song I've heard is Sting's 'Shape of my Heart'. I loved the haunting violin sounds throughout the film. With regards to other comments on the the 'sexual' nature of Leon and Mathilda's relationship, I'd like to think it was innocent, pure love and a lack of a decent father figure in her life, but I may change my mind when I see the uncut version!"

As you get more and more into the plot you start feeling all the emotions that impregnate the atmosphere.The innocence of Leon, the tension between him and Mathilda, the noxious generosity of Tony and the psycho behavior of Stan.You really want to watch this movie, as not everyday they make an action film as superb as Leon.M."
arthurclay,"Sep 5, 2004",N/A,"Never have I seen a film so well put together. Amazingly enough The Professional was the best work done by these four thespians: Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Danny Aiello AND Gary Oldman. They probably didn't know it at the time it was released and neither did anybody else. Why this movie was denied at the Academy Awards we may never know but it was terrific. The on screen chemistry between Reno and Portman is unforgettable. Their relationship is what makes it work but the real star is Gary Oldman. He is phenomenal repeat phenomenal. His over the top performance is the best of his entire career and earned his character Agent Norman Stansfield the number 6 spot on the Entertainment Weekly's all time greatest villains list.I have read the reviews of the two people in the world who didn't like this film and it doesn't take long to figure out why they didn't like it. The first didn't have a clue about what the movie was really about (readers can draw their own conclusions about that person's mental capacity) and the other somehow arrived at the erroneous conclusion that director Luc Besson is a sellout. I'm not going to bother to respond to that. The acting was top drawer for such a small budgeted film, the dialogue was remarkable and there is enough action to keep you entertained. Best film of 1994 and number 64 on the top 250 movies on IMDb."
joshtjj,"Sep 9, 2020",7/10,"Leon the Professional wastes no time in proving itself as one of the greatest crime dramas ever made. An expertly crafted story that shows the connection between a young and frightened girl and her hitman neighbour. The beauty of the plot is how as Mathilda teaches Leon to be more caring and kind, she learns from him how to be ruthless and cold. Both actors play the characters brilliantly well, but the highlight is definitely Gary Oldman as the arrogant and psychotic main villain, which is one of the greatest actor performances of all time."
agentvega,"Sep 20, 2013",9/10,"This film totally withstands the test of time. You can watch it today and it still feels just as fresh and relevant as when it came out. The international cut is better than the U.S. cut, but any version is worth the watch. Even as a kid, you can tell that Natalie Portman is destined for great things. I feel like even though Gary Oldman's character is a bit over the top, he still makes him as believable as possible. But, the stand out is obviously Jean Reno. Amazing as ever. Just a perfect roll for him. I must have seen this film at least 20 times, and every time I catch some little nuance that I missed in the past or just see something differently than I had before. It is just a great, if not underrated movie, and not only worth a viewing, but many. You surely will not be disappointed, and if you somehow are, give it another chance to grow on you. A very good friend of mine was not a fan upon first viewing, but now counts it as one of his favorites."
alekspredator87,"Jul 17, 2022",7/10,"Luc Besson's film ""Leon"" is really strong. This is an amazing creative work of a genius director whose style cannot be confused with anything. Besson loudly declares himself to the world with this work, makes the audience be chained to the screens. And it catches everything: the plot, the acting, the music, the atmosphere.Actor Jean Renaud is very famous. His tired look is always recognizable. And here his hero, despite the sadness on his face, goes to his goal, he is dangerous and, it seems, invulnerable. But confidence, composure, lack of pity suddenly crumble into dust when he meets a little girl and gets into her feelings. And the actor perfectly shows how his character is changing.This film opened for me one of my favorite actresses - Natalie Portman. Today she is known all over the world. And not without reason. The actress is very talented. And this picture is a great start, which helped her already at such a young age to show an excellent game. Natalie plays little Matilda, a little naive, not knowing the world around her yet, but insightful and, as we see, able to melt the ice even of a ruthless killer. And now these two lonely people find a kind of shelter in each other's company.The atmosphere is wonderful, the unique style is sustained. Although all the pernicious boils of society in the form of drugs, murders, crimes are present around the characters, Besson competently weaves all this into the picture, not making a bright emphasis on this, but telling a completely different dramatic story.""Leon"" is a great film by a competent director who helped at least two actors show their skills in an extraordinary story, probably even a love story. Everyone will see their own. One thing cannot be taken away - the picture does not lose its relevance today and looks timeless.7 out of 10."
DaveDiggler,"May 14, 2008",4/10,"""Leon: The Professional"" is about a love story intertwined with some ridiculous shootouts. The shootouts are unimaginative and plain stupid with the 1.9 million bullets fired at Leon, with three hitting, then Leon' disappearing acts, where he goes from the ceiling; to the hallway; to the bathroom, then, directly behind the guy he's going to kill, and he does it just like a professional... or a magician. One of the worst parts of the action scenes, especially at the end, is when everything is predictable about 30 seconds before it happens. That's the worst kind of predictability. Where you just find out what's going to happen before it does, because when this thrilling sequence happens- that you've been waiting for 30 seconds- it ends up not being so thrilling, and instead, becomes worthless and terribly ineffective. ""The Professional"" is flat. The love story involves Mathilda (Natalie Portman) and Leon (Jean Reno). Portman is twelve and Leon is old like 40. Don't be fooled, though, they love each other, but their relationship is strictly platonic. Even though Mathilda is much wiser beyond her years and ready for a sexual relationship, Leon is not, but he is tempted. Besson uses several shots throughout the film that places our eyes directly on the twelve-year-old's body. We get the feeling she's ready for it and that Leon want's it, but like Leon, Besson is tempting us because Leon is tempted. He shows her caressing her stomach, or getting out of bed with a shot directly on her underwear as she walks to the kitchen. Intriguing stuff expect she's twelve. What's the point of using a twelve-year-old here? I have no idea. Is it ridiculous and over-the-top? Of course it is and maybe that's the reason. Everything else is so stupid and over-the-top it's almost unwatchable and get's really annoying so why not put a twelve- year-old and 40-something in the middle of a weird love story that doesn't make any sense or have any purpose in a film such as this? Even the action is annoying. When it's not annoying it's boring. It's some of the stupidest stuff you'll ever see. It's unintelligent and plain stupid. The director has Leon stand behind a wall, a bunch of bullets go flying through the wall, and Leon is perfectly okay. Better yet, he's standing behind the people who are shooting at the wall he standing behind, and, then he kills them... all of them... in seconds. Wow. That's impressive stuff (sarcasm). Leon sleeps on a chair with sunglasses and a gun not too far away. His best friend is a plant. It doesn't ask questions and Leon likes that. He drinks a glass of milk by the quart; never the gallon. Oh, the excitement!!!! Leon has it all.The best thing that came out of this steaming pile of garbage is Gary Oldman. Like everything else, his character is over-the-top, but he seems to be the only that embraces it and goes with it. He is so good as the crazy, classical music loving, DEA agent that's so corrupt he loves taking lives. He actually, loves it. That's insane, right? Completely unfathomable? That's right, it is, but Oldman seems to be the only one in this that takes this film for what it is. Everyone else, Besson the worst, acts as if this is somehow plausible. That's when action films like this can't be enjoyable. When the directors know, the actors know, the writers know, and the audiences know this is all over-the-top and all about action, action, and more action is when films such as ""Leon"" are successful. Not like this, though. Not only are the action sequence poorly done, but the stereotypes of cops left and right with their minds on women, or family problems, or the they're just too stupid to do their job is not only ridiculous but tired and stereotypical and unimaginative. Besson does his best to make this feel anything but European. Reno is supposed to be Italian, see the casting director for that screw up, and Tony (Danny Aiello) is an Italian store-owner who does nothing but order people to be killed- And he has Leon kill a lot of people. Why? Who knows? Besson doesn't understand that's the good stuff. Anyone can make a movie about someone killing someone. Anyone. Tony has a drug ring, but we don't have a clue what it's about, or who it evolves, or where it comes from or anything. The worst part about Aiello's performance is that he thinks this is going to be the 90s version of, ""The Godfather."" Yeah, not working here, leave it to Brando and Pacino to pull off the real Mob Boss performances in real Mob movies. ""The Last Don"" didn't do it either. Try reading a script with some depth to it.This takes place in New York City, but you'll get the feeling it takes place in Europe with stupid American's that keep popping up and doing stupid things. It doesn't have much to say about anything. It wants to be bold and outgoing and push the envelope in regards to teens and middle aged men hooking up, but nothing in this film works. The more you think about it, the more you'll be able to pick apart this terribly flawed, substance-less action piece apart. As for the relationship between the forty-year-old and the twelve-year-old? What does it say? Not a whole lot other than love can actually make you happy, but when you're Leon, that doesn't last long and that, too, is predictable. This is simply terrible film-making that also looks outdated."
kramfamily,"Feb 10, 2014",10/10,"And WOW! When I was a kid I've probably seen this movie at least 10 times, if not more. For the longest time I didn't feel like watching this movie because I felt like I've already seen it too many times. But God Damn! I loved it when I was 9, and since then I've read plenty of books, and experienced too much of what life can offer. All that made this movie beyond incredible for me to describe in the true richness of emotions I felt.First of all, I do think it's better than Nabokov's Lolita. And I am Russian, so trust me, it means a lot for me to say that. Lolita was incredible for the first half, but this movie kept at it the whole time. Have I mentioned it made me ball my eyes out too? Definitely a better love story than Lolita.Then, there is Natalie Portman. For all these years I couldn't figure out why I thought she was the most beautiful woman in the world. Eight years later after watching this movie I've met a girl that looked exactly like her (Yes I'll clear this up, you creeps, she was the same age as me, 17). And I had no clue how a person could captivate me so much and for all these years after taking just one look at her.Now, after watching this movie at the age of 25, I understand where that came from. And yes it did make it a little awkward to watch a young Natalie Portman and remember those feelings. Did make it easier to feel for Leon though.To that I add, absolutely perfect writing, screenplay, acting and cinematography. Even if you've seen this movie before, do remember that it's been 20 years since it came out. Do yourself a favor and watch it again."

fallyhag,"Jul 18, 2009",10/10,"There really is nothing I can say bad about this film. I have read the negative reviews in here and I am just left wondering how stupid these people must be. How do they not get it? Is it because there is too much emotion or connection with the characters or was the way it was expertly directed a problem? I always love a film that breaks the mould and gets away from cliché film scenes. I can remember watching this film years ago and I still love it as much today. The characters, the story and the whole damn way it is filmed.I 100% recommend this for anyone who loves a film that isn't saturated in Hollywood filth. This is a highly recommended masterpiece."

deatman9,"Aug 29, 2011",N/A,"This is a very good drama/action movie. It stars Jean Reno a great french actor who is very good in this movie. It also stars a young Natalie Portman who does an outstanding job opposite Jean.This movie is about a hit-man (Reno) who lives down the hall from a young girl named Matilda (Portman). The young girls family is in some trouble with drug dealers . The drug dealers send people to kill them, Luckily Matilda is not home at the time. She sees the intruders in her apartment and passses right by to the apartment at the end of the hall Leons apartment (Reno). He opens the door lets her in and they start an unlikely friendship.This movie was really good. It had a great story line really good acting and a lot of action mixed with drama. It is a great watch for pretty much anybody."
monty_lnct,"Apr 20, 2010",10/10,"Leon(the professional) is a very underrated masterpiece.The greatness of this movie lies in its characters,no matter how many flaws story of this movie had you don't look at them as you are so involved and mesmerized from the emotions flowing on the screen.this movie without any doubt is among greatest movie ever made.however,critics rating doesn't justify its greatness and i can understand why first of all no can swallow the fact that a single man can beat the whole company of swat commandos without any automatic weapon and hideout,many would not swallow the learning of 13 year old girl how to be a cleaner by a professional killer,many people would not understand the relationship between Leon and Mathilda and they misjudged their feelings.but i think in the movie these all has been handled with correct moral and very finely.instead of all its flaws you don't care about them because all the emotions and characters conquer all of your attention from these flaws.As i said the greatness of this movie lies in its characters,they had given such a depth to each character that every character left an profound impact on you.these movie have one of the most beautifully portraited characters.whether it is Mathilda,Leon and each and every character in movie they all have been very influencing and powerful,no matter how small are they. Leon and Mathilda however very peculiar and odd but one of the very lovable and sensitive lead pair ever created.the character of Mathilda was of emotionally damaged 13 year old girl who behave like a grown up mature girl,do smoking,filled with revenge and love and above all she is innocent and cute.her feelings can be easily understand by looking into her dysfunctional family.She was neglected by her father,elder sister and mother and due to her protective feelings towards her younger brother,she grown herself mentally or we can say she lost her childhood to become habitual with her harshful life.the dialogs of Mathilda was very mature but you also get sympathized with her and also laugh on her innocence and her naive feelings.Her feelings towards Leon can be easily understood as he saved her and she wanted her revenge through Leon.the character of Mathilda played by very talented Natalie portman she give best performance of her career in her debut.the protagonist Leon is also very complex and hard to understand because instead of being a professional killer, he is very good hearted and sensitive.jean reno played the character of Leon and he did very astonishing job because it was very difficult for audience to grew sympathy for a man whose profession is killing people and jean reno successfully accomplished this.Leon is one of all time favorite character for me and one of my favorite line from a movie ""no women no kids"".the feelings and love of Leon towards Mathilda was totally platonic and nothing was immoral and absurd in it.another character of the movie who was highly influencing and impactful was of Stanfield who is the antagonist of movie and was portrayed by Gary old man.you will always feel fear and shivering when he come on screen,a total psychopath,i wondered how did he passed the medical test for being a police officer.you will hate him as much as you never hated anyone before.also the characters of tony,malky,Mathilda's family and even every small roles in movie were very beautifully and perfectly portrayed.luc besson directed the movie very well,every thing was perfect with movie.the intensity and tension created during many scenes was unbearable and thrilled us from inside.scenes when Standford murdered the family,the sniper scene at roof,or the shootout scenes at beginning and ending of movie,the scene when Mathilda tried to shoot herself were very thrilling and almost stop my breathing. music of the movie composed by Eric Serra was very pleasant and played very important role for making movie more involving and touching for us.i really get disappointed when i saw that Leon was not even nominated for any award.i believe that movie should have been nominated for academy for best movie,best director (luc besson)best leading actor(jean reno),actress(Natalie portman) and also for supporting actor(Gary old man) ,soundtrack(eric Serra).it was very unfortunate that movie remained unnoticed due to low publicity among movies like pulp fiction,Forrest gump and the shawshank redemption which was released during the same year of 1994.this movie has every potential to stand along with these movies."
thefilmguy7,"Jan 19, 2010",5/10,"I just watched Leon The Professional and I'm a little perplexed as to why this film has such high ratings. While Jean Reno delivered a solid performance, the film felt like a mess for the most part. There were HUGE gaps in logic and reason with some of the plot points. What was up with Gary Oldman? Was he like the emperor of the DEA? The crap that he got away with is totally impossible. I don't even see how the guy could work in the DEA considering that he is a total psychotic. The whole finale was ridiculous too. Did Luc Besson bother to take any time at all in researching DEA procedures or protocols? The DEA acted more like the mob than anything.It's one thing to ask the audience to suspend disbelief but this film takes that to a whole other level. It goes so far out of the realm of possibility in places that it becomes more of a fantasy/sci fi film than a crime action film. Also what was up with the music? It was always totally inappropriate for the scenes. It was just completely off and awkward. I really wanted to like this film. I have generally been a fan of Luc Besson's other films and I'm a fan of the cast. Unfortunately this movie was a real challenge to sit through. Now there were some redeeming moments. I liked the little moments that established Leon's character. How he drinks milk, cares for his plant, and sits in the dark. I liked some of the little moments between Leon and Mathilda. There were a few good action beats. However none of these positives are enough to give the film the kind of rating that it has here on IMDb. The film is average at the very best. It offers no intelligence or soul to it's story. The concept could have worked if it was done correctly but sadly it wasn't."
kosmasp,"Jul 24, 2022",9/10,"It has been a while - and I don't think I had seen the Direcotrs Cut of the movie up til earlier. There is something interesting - well more than something, but let's start from the top/beginning, no pun intended.The movie starts off quite out there. It is almost comical - not just how Leon looks (the long coat and generally the way he dresses and walks - influences from the silent era? Quite possibly), but how he but even more so, the bad guys act. There is an air of amateurish and not proffesional vibe in the air.Leon of course seems to be in control of everything. So much so, that it seems his hand is detached of his body - especially when he has a knife at someones throat. A great dissapearing act commences.Leon has some very fine action scenes and has some very fine actors too. Take the three main ones - Jean Reno obviously in the main role, but also Natalie Portman as a kid and even more so Gary Oldman as the main villain. More about Natalie and her role in a second, but Gary Oldman is the ingredient that really elevates the movie above others. His performance made this movie work on many different levels.And maybe make you forget about certain things that seem weird in hindsight. There is the strange humor and the incapable almost cartoonish goons (though apparently they seem to be able to work the other side of the law - without consequences). No pun intended.The movie also has a weird relationship that builds between Natalies and Jeans character. You may have issues how she connects with him and how she is portrayed. But if you remeber being a kid, a teen, you may remember saying inappropriate things as well. She doesn't know any better - that is the best way to look at it. Otherwise you are making a case agains the movie and what it portrays.A few years later a still not adult Natalie Portman was still making men go crazy. Beautiful girls - you can see Natalie Portman and you can recognize her. Her performance is magnificent. We came to expect that from her. And I don't think making this movie scarred her in any way shape or form.There is the music the movie has and the New York vibes (mostly second unit shots I reckon). Then there is also the late great Danny Aiello. A terrific actor, who is shady, but also loveable.And back to Reno: his grumpy performance really works best. He seems to channel some heroes from the past. Strange he is not able to recognize Charlie Chaplin in a game of guess who. Even stranger still that the young Mathilde (Natalie Portman) does know Marylin Monroe and Chaplin ... especially because she only seems to be watching cartoons.As good as Leon is, there are certain things that do not make much sense. Like entering a bulding he has no business being in .. and without much resistence either ... just suspend your disbelief and go with the flow. Because this looks and sounds good ... and is the movie that made Reno and Portman the stars they are ... or at least send the on the trajectory they are (still) on.Edit: Matthilde is cursing a lot - okay? Hopefully you answer with okay, even if that would make Leon angry (if you know, you know)"
Lethiferous123,"Sep 29, 2022",9/10,"Luc Besson's ""The Professional"" is sort of a companion piece to his international breakthrough hit ""La Femme Nikiti"", and in many ways it's an even better film. It raises the stakes of Besson's playful women-with-guns theme by making the heroine a 12-year-old, played by a then unknown Natalie Portman. Jean Reno is excellent as her assassin trainer and surrogate father. Oldman is completely over the top in one of his best bad-guy roles, obsessed with both Beethoven and butchery. As a gritty, suspenseful thriller, this film won't leave action fans feeling cheated, but the film is so much more than that. At the center of ""The Professional"" is a wonderful father and daughter-like relationship between two damaged strangers who find solace in each other."
snakej32,"Apr 4, 2004",6/10,"Hilarious, I have more laughs watching this movie with my friends than anything, think about it: The overly done stupid Milk thing, the whole first scene with things like: Leon randomly being in a vent to kill some guy when he was just on the stairs less than a minute before, when the balcony window closes hes somehow shooting towards it when he clearly isnt on the balcony which means he must be floating in the air in front of the building, him magically appearing and disappearing in a dark hallway in the beginning as well as his arm stretching when he backs up from the fat guy, the guys they try to pass off as D.E.A. (like the white Jamacan guy with a machine gun who empties his whole clip wildly in a small apartment or a guy who can sniff peoples lies and is high on drugs all the time) the whole pig in the kitchen thing (HES A HITMAN CMON), him taking in and training a little 12 year old girl who aspires to be a cleaner and having a strange relationship with her (if you see the uncut version the restaraunt scene is....strange) AND THEN HE GOES ON HITS WITH HER TOO, AND SHE USES A SILENCED PAINTBALL GUN! And has anyone looked closely at his choice of style? If you look you can see that his pants come up to his ankles and he wears knee socks haha, i'm sure thats what real hitmen dress like. Also, him using double pistols upsidown to kill a whole swat team, him surviving a grenade in a tiny apartment that hit right next to him (just by doing his hilarious ""AHHHHHHHHHHHH"" and diving a few feet to his side)and then him being able to recover from the blast with almost no injuries and then changing into an entire swat uniform in under 30 seconds. Also, Leon not noticing (in a totally empty hallway) that someone is following him with a gun (in a huge empty hallway you could surely hear someone else's footsteps, especially when they are right behind you.)If you want to see a good movie about a hitman watch Ghost Dog or even Road to Perdition. And Reno is damn good in La Femme Nikita as Victor, that's how a real ""cleaner"" would be, not a compassionate pedaphilic aging man who loves milk and plays with a pig ovenmit like Leon. I have to admit that the first time I saw this movie I liked it, but that was before I realized all of it's inconsistencies, if you watch it more than once it becomes more of a comedy, go ahead watch it again and really analyze it, I'm sure there's even more stuff I left out"
moonspinner55,"Jan 27, 2010",7/10,"French filmmaker Luc Besson's darkly intriguing, absorbing modern noir about a precocious, orphaned preteen girl in New York City (Natalie Portman) who attaches herself to a thorough, yet curiously mild-mannered hit man (Jean Reno). Begins as a rich character study studded with small bursts of violent action, with very little theatrics or inane hyperbole. Unfortunately, in the third act, Besson allows the violence to take over, leading to an over-baked finale with an eye on the commercial market. Still, a sleek and handsome piece of work, entertaining, mature and straightforward, with terrific performances by Reno and the shockingly unself-conscious Portman. *** from ****"
secondtake,"Jun 5, 2015",9/10,"Leon the Professional (1994)A tightly wrought, ironically charming (and no so ironically violet) caper about an accomplished assassin and a sweet girl. The assassin Leon is played with dry, raspy wit by Jean Reno. He's one of those guys who's ""the best"" without question, and who lives off the radar naturally. All he has is a suitcase and a potted plant in his small apartment. The girl, Mathilda, is played with a perfect combination of innocence and worldly savvy by Natalie Portman. When her family is wiped out by gangsters, she is taken in by the assassin, who happens to live next door.The bad guys are led by Gary Oldman, who is a caricature of an evil thug gangleader. And behind the scenes in the middle of all his is the inimitable Danny Aiello in a small but important role. All of this weirdly makes sense, and the plot moves along with our growing concern for Mathilda, above all. And then for Leon, by extension.So whether you call this a buddy movie or an over-the-top farce, it's so well connected, smoothly filmed, and forcefully acted it just feels and looks right. It's just superbly made.Director and writer Luc Besson is a marvel, really, and anyone who has seen ""La Femme Nikita"" or ""Fifth Element"" knows that he can show imagination and style with edgy contemporary punch. He's the main example of the so-called ""cinema du look"" style of French movies, a kind of counter-balance in self-aware movie-making to Quentin Tarantino's more artificial style. Besson is essentially a writer first and director second, and he wrote all of these as well as the ""Taken"" movies that have recently been so successful both in France and here.If some bloody violence doesn't put you off, add this to your must-see list."
JaydoDre,"Feb 6, 2015",8/10,"I was about the same age as the 12-year-old Mathilda, played by Nathalie Portman, when I first watched this film, and boy, did I drool over this girl, with her choker and that bob haircut and that conveniently barren shoulder. What is Director Luc Besson's excuse though? The creators knew what they were doing when creating the sexual tension between Mathilda and our main man Leon, played by Jean Reno, especially given the events in the extended cut of the movie, where the relationship between Mathilda and Leon is further expanded upon. That's ok, Mr. Besson, I won't tell.Interestingly, even in the extended cut, the relationship between Mathilda and Leon works surprisingly well, without crossing into the offensive territory, because Leon is still a boy at heart, who never got to grow up due to the hardships in his life and their relationship is touching and innocent. Nonetheless, this movie would never be made today, given the cultural censorship.Those familiar with Luc Besson's other works know that this guy is obsessed with showing distressed but strong female characters with guns that get thrown into a harsh male-dominated world. This creates an interesting contrast between tender elegance and masculine brutality. Leon is, perhaps, the best version of this concept. In Besson's ""La Femme Nikita"" it was an adult woman and in his other film, ""Lucy"", the female character is too overpowered, so the vulnerability is lost. In Leon, on the other hand, it really is a lonely little girl up against the mobsters.Speaking of which, Gary Oldman's performance as the main villain might be his best performance. He puts all of himself behind it, ranging from quietly menacing to almost blowing up his vocal chords. Between the 3 main characters, this film delivers captivating performances that keep you anchored in your seat from beginning to end.Perhaps the single largest problem in the film is the shallow childish mood produced by the writing. This movie has so much awkward, simplistic and cheesy dialogue, which points out the obvious and does not give the viewer anything deep to think about. The dialogue sounds like something that would be written by a teenage boy. Matilda talks like no kid of her age would. Take even the title of the film: in the US, the movie is called ""Leon: the Professional"". A title like that evokes an immature comic book about assassins and ninja's.The movie looks phenomenal though. It has a peculiar grungy look, which I love. The movie Is supposed to be set in New York, but has a European vibe. Shot in a warm sepia tone, people's sweating faces and cramped apartments with run-down dirty walls combine with Jean Reno's French accent to give this film a foreign look. This makes complete sense when you find out that the interior filming was done in France. It's like New York and Paris were smushed together in this alternate universe.The soundtrack mixes very well with the visuals. There is a memorable crying violin theme and menacing heavy drums mixed in with atmospheric drones. Those violins give weight to the dirty reality in which the characters find themselves and you can feel the heat of the city through the music.The Extended Cut of the film adds almost half an hour of film with a lot of additional story that actually changes the meaning and dynamic of the movie. The added content is considerably more emotional, sexual but also silly and funny. The short version is cleaner but far less emotionally loaded, cutting out one especially important heart-to-heart scene.Leon is a little silly, childish and exploitative, but it is one of the best thrillers with excellent performances and is Luc Besson's best work."
amelieproductions-67179,"Feb 9, 2025",10/10,"The movie is dark. Violence is at almost every turn and the story is nothing short of tragic. But beautifully made with a tinge of chic. Natalie Portman is breathtaking as an actress. She had me in tears. Both actors had great chemistry and made for a story that was hard to look away from. You'll be at the edge of your seat and you won't be bored. Some of the shots and angles were spectacular and I would say artistic. Both characters are complexe. Mathilda had inappropriate feelings for Leon, which we can't tell whether he reciprocates or not, and it leaves us disturbed yet intrigued. But I mean, look at her upbringing. She's a broken girl who I'm sure struggles to understand what love for a father figure feels like. Is her behaviour, based on her background, so far from the truth at times? The corrupt cop is heinous but oddly fun to watch. As somebody else here mentioned ""quirky"". He'll make you sick to your stomach but keep you entertained. Leon is a complexe character who we're hoping to be the good guy in the whole situation, but he's still a hitman with disturbed morals. Leaving any room for hope bleak. It was moving, none the less and I highly recommend as a classic."
philhouston,"Oct 9, 2011",N/A,"Leon is by far and away one of the best films I have seen. When I first read a synopsis of the plot I was wary of how good it would be but I am so glad that I got round to watching this masterpiece. There are many reviews that recommend viewing the extended version (US) which has 25 mins more scenes included, but after seeing both versions I honestly would say that the shorter version is better. There is nothing from the scenes cut that is relevant to the plot, and the character development in no way suffers from this deletion; rather I found more association with the characters in the shorter viewing than I did with the extended version, but in the end the film is just as good regardless of which version you watched. A definite top 10 this film, recommended for everyone, especially those who enjoy a good emotional roller-coaster."

sanadalsalt,"Jun 8, 2025",10/10,"Luc Besson's Léon: The Professional delivers a gripping narrative brought to life by exceptional casting, courtesy of Todd Thaler. Every element of the film works harmoniously to create a compelling cinematic experience.Jean Reno stars as Léon, a quiet and emotionally repressed hitman-referred to as a ""cleaner""-who leads a life of strict routine and isolation. His world is abruptly disrupted when he crosses paths with Mathilda, a twelve-year-old girl living in the same apartment building. Forced into an unlikely partnership after a personal tragedy, Léon is introduced to the notion of a normal life, despite the extraordinary and violent circumstances that bring them together.Natalie Portman, in her breakout role as Mathilda, delivers a performance that is nothing short of remarkable. At just twelve years old, Portman showcases a rare emotional depth and subtlety, using body language and facial expressions to convey vulnerability, determination, and raw emotion. Her chemistry with Reno is powerful and genuine, creating a relationship that evolves from necessity into a profound bond.Jean Reno brings to Léon a quiet intensity and depth, portraying a man who has spent his life detached from feeling-until Mathilda enters his life. Through her, he finds a sense of purpose beyond his profession. Léon becomes a surrogate father figure, while Mathilda discovers safety, trust, and the complexities of love. Their connection is the heart of the film.Gary Oldman's portrayal of corrupt DEA agent Norman Stansfield is electrifying and unforgettable. His performance is unhinged, unpredictable, and terrifying in all the right ways-driving the narrative forward with a chilling sense of menace. Oldman crafts one of the most iconic villains in modern cinema, balancing charisma with chaos.What makes Léon: The Professional so effective is its refusal to rely on spectacle. Without sprawling sets, heavy special effects, or a lineup of A-list stars, the film proves that storytelling, character development, and outstanding performances are more than enough. Alongside Reno, Portman, and Oldman, Danny Aiello rounds out the cast as Tony, Léon's handler, adding further nuance to the film's emotional weight.Eric Serra's haunting and energetic score complements the film's tone perfectly, elevating both its tension and tender moments. While the plot may seem simple at its core, it is enhanced by every detail-cinematography, music, acting, and direction-all contributing to a powerful and unforgettable experience.Simply put, Léon: The Professional is a masterclass in storytelling and character-driven filmmaking."

Step by step they forme special relationship where he teaches young girl to be killer like him.First of all relationship between young girl and killer is by standards today very controversial and Besson gives this unique europen touch.Action scenes are fantastic and acting is superb. Every actor gave great performance but Gary Oldman as corupted cop is by my opinion his best role ever and i think it deserved an Oscar.A masterpiece and definitely one of the greatest movie from the 90' s."
justin-fencsak,"Jun 22, 2019",9/10,"25 years ago, Luc Besson was a director on the rise with his cult hit Le Femme Nikita which spawned a popular USA tv show of the same name. His big break was this film, which became a global hit and featured the debut of Natalie Portman as the daughter of the professional, played by Jean Reno, who would go on to star in movies such as the ill fated Godzilla 1998 remake. This movie is highly recommended for action fans, as this movie paved the way for other films, including Besson's big hit Taken trilogy."
DFC-2,"Sep 17, 1999",N/A,"This is a modern fantasy complete with twisted lives, nobility, endangered innocence, self-sacrifice, death, true love, and monstrous evil.  If you look very closely, it all dissolves into an unholy mess as did the knight's tales it resembles.  But, if you can forget reality and focus on the emotional appeal of the story, Luc Besson's drama rivals the best mythology can offer.  It works because the values that help Mathilda and Léon to find redemption are as timeless as the fears that terrify them. Before the film ends, she has helped him care about life again, and he has given her a decent adult she can believe in.Jean Reno plays a masterful, but childlike hitman who avoids all contact with anyone but his employer.  His rules are simple, he will not kill women or kids, he does not get emotionally involved with others, he takes care of himself so that he can do his job, and he takes his responsibilities seriously.  His knightly persona is complete with a disregard for money, profound humility, clean living, and a gentle spirit.  Reno makes it all work well.  Despite his off-handed disregard for human life, Léon is an extremely sympathetic hero.Natalie Portman, however, steals the show with her portrayal of a willful preteen devastated by the loss of her brother and adrift in a sea of powerful emotions.  Incapable or unwilling to face the consequences of her actions, she wants a final end to the turmoil inside her.  Portman does an amazing job showing the vulnerable child wanting an adult end to her isolation.  Good or bad, her innocence and reckless intensity make the movie work.  That Léon sees what is at stake and in his incoherent way tries to keep her safe is the hallmark of his nobility and should speak to everyone who cares about the sanctity of trust.The only downside to this picture was the stylized and unrealistic enemy. Gary Oldman is a wonderful actor, and the fact that his exaggerated rendition of a corrupt DEA agent comes across as believable is a testament to his skill.  In general, his crew comes across as cartoonish at best. Some of the more outrageous scenes include a bad guy preparing himself to stab a mattress, and the horde of skimask-wearing ninja/swat team/jack-booted-thugs who show up near the end.  The last time I saw such a ridiculous collection of enforcement personnel was in the ""Blues Brothers.""The monstrous evil in this piece is the emotional purgatory that both Mathilda and Léon experience alone. Their journey to unexpected peace is unlike any story I have ever seen.  Besson makes you care about the internal lives of his wounded couple by presenting the horror and nobility of their relationship with full intensity.   Mathilda's wish to die or find love, Léon's near willingness to kill her or let her kill herself, and their mutual disregard for the killing of others is mind numbing but powerful. Given the context of an uncommunicative killer afraid of involvement, a reckless child, and a lifestyle based on violent confrontation, they have few chances to survive and prosper.  The only things they have going for them are Léon's decency and Mathilda's complete faith in him.  The fact that faith and decency are enough makes for a first-rate medieval story in modern dress."
volad,"Feb 8, 2006",6/10,"It's surprising that ""Leon"" is so highly ranked (as of Feb. 2006), as it is so weak in so many respects. There are basically two things that it is trying to give us: (1) great one-elite-versus-many-soldiers-shoot-em-up sequences; and, what would make this movie special, if it worked, (2) a view into a very unusual and interesting relationship, with tinges of father/daughter, of master/apprentice, criminal/partner, and of lover/lover.It delivers decent shoot-em-up, but fairly little that stands out much from the vast quantities of decent material of that kind in 90s (and 00s) Hollywood film. If you *love* that kind of thing, you won't be disappointed.On the other hand, the relationship idea suffers from weak execution. Some of the specific plot and script ideas are to blame, but N. Portman is basically unbelievable, for the most part, and in a boring way. J. Reno is excellent, and there is some ""chemistry"" there, but there were just too many times when the cinematic illusion was broken and I just wanted to roll my eyes---the fascinating premise disappeared and I found myself thinking things like ""man, what a dumb line"". (Nothing as bad as the intimate scenes of Portman/Christensen in the Star Wars movies, which feel like a caricatured rendering of the interior imaginations of an inexperienced fifteen-year-old reading a mediocre discount store romance novel. But that's not saying much.)So, I suggest that ""Leon"" does not deserve to be in the company of nearby-ranked action-oriented films (""Das Boot"", ""Se7en"", ""Alien"", ""Fight Club"") or noir (""Maltese Falcon"", ""Chinatown"", ""LA Confidential"").I should add that I believe I saw the ""U. S."" version; there appears to be a longer version."
kenjha,"Jun 28, 2008",6/10,"Clichés abound in this contrived thriller about a hit-man who ends up adopting a 12-year-old girl. As the orphan, Portman is wonderful in her film debut. As Leon, Reno does OK but his character is unbelievable and underdeveloped. It is hard to believe that Leon, an uneducated, dim-witted, child-like fellow who loves plants and drinks milk is also a cold-blooded killer. He tells Portman she shouldn't use foul language but teaches her how to kill people. What a guy! Oldman, who would play Beethoven in his next film, is horribly over-the-top as a Beethoven-loving psycho DEA agent. On the plus side, the score is nice and the celebrity impersonations by Portman and Reno are amusing."
tekstorm,"Aug 4, 2024",9/10,"I understand the controversy behind this film. It's definitely a questionable choice to portray it that way. However, I need to say that it's not done in a way that's inappropriate, simply questionable and weird. The protagonist doesn't plainly do anything bad in that regards and the film definitely doesn't glorify what happens from my understanding.If you look beyond that and watch the film for what it is, you will find a beautiful, captivating and touching story. Through it's story it tells something deeper about our lives. How we toughen up and become, metaphorically, cold blooded machines and how purity and love can come in our life and break that down and what it entails.If you're able to set aside and ignore the controversial aspects of the film, I guarantee you will find a beautiful story that you will be watching and thinking about many times in the future."

blueangel-76133,"Oct 1, 2019",9/10,"What absolutely amazing performances by Natalie Portman, Jean Reno and Gary Oldman. And what a brutally honest but realistic portrayal of the life of a young girl from such a despicable family and circumstances. When Portman's character asks Reno's if life is always this bad and you expect him to give her a banal platitude but he says, true to his character, ""Yes, always like this."" it sets the intense but powerful tone of this film. This all of course is complimented by Oldman's mesmoring insantity with lines such as when his fellow police officers ask him who they should call for backup and he screams ""EVERYONE!"" This is truly a film that stays with you for a lifetime."
nilayduygun,"Dec 10, 2012",10/10,"""The Professional"" is one of my favorite films. It is deliberately amazing, so I am fall in love with this film. Can a person fall in love with a film? Yes, I am. Despite the fact that 18 years have passed since the release of the film, its fame is still intact, and it is still watched by many person, also I am one of them. I watch it again and again. It makes me cry whenever I watch it especially, at the end of the film. Intercalarily, I love its soundtrack so much, because its melody affects me so bad. The film shows that there is a real love. One can understand the real love from relationship between Mathilda and Leon. Why I love Jean Reno is this film, and also I admire acting of Natalie Portman even she is at a young age in the film. My advice to anyone is that do not die not to watch this film!"
smits59,"Dec 30, 2011",6/10,"Leon is a well acted but poorly written movie. Portman and specially Reno give an very good performance. But Besson fails at every level. The story is nothing less then stupid. OK you get sucked in for about an hour but then the last bit of credibility is lost. Only if you are prepared to believe anything, there is a flick left. I won't go into spoilers but if you believe that when you go give two policemen a headache the whole police-force collapses then this is a great movie. It's just as believable as The Fifth Element but pretends to be much more. If Besson had kept to making a farce it could have been a great movie! But his attempt on ""feelings"" makes it an absolute no-brainer. Enjoy but don't think."
Hitchcoc,"Aug 6, 2024",10/10,"Usually, I don't go for super violent films. I've mentioned before that I love Scorsese, but I'm uncomfortable with his produce, well done as it is. Here, a hitman, illiterate but extremely good at his ""job"" finds himself saddled with a twelve year old girl (Natalie Portman of all people) who makes her way into his dangerous life. Her whole dysfunctional family has been killed by a psycho played by Gary Oldman. One of his victims is her four year old brother. She is daring (too much so), putting herself and her friend, Leon, in danger. There are several violent scenes and a nice relationship which could lead to redemption. Of course, that is not going to happen. This is a gem of a movie, despite its harsh subject."
TheMovieDiorama,"May 13, 2018",8/10,"Safe to say this film has spawned many iterations of omnipotent invincible hitmen, it isn't hard to see why. Opening to a lukewarm reception, Léon has rapidly garnered cult status and is a firm favourite amongst film aficionados. A young girl's family is brutally gunned down by a crooked detective, she teams up with a hitman named Léon in order to avenge their deaths. Suffice to say this is an action drama that needs to be viewed by everyone...and I mean ""EVERYONEEEE!"". It would be easy to class this as an exaggerative over-the-top action thrill ride, but it's so much more than that. Thanks to Besson's Parisian directing style, he focussed his attention to the quirky original relationship between Léon and Mathilda. A girl who has experienced the dark side of life, growing up with a father who deals drugs and regularly hooking up with women. To then be embraced by a determined yet warming hitman, her idyllic fantasy of a caring father figure becomes reality. The bond that rapidly forms between these two characters is fascinating to watch. Her idolisation for him and his protectiveness for her. It's a union that shouldn't work, but does. They both teach each other aspects of life they aren't necessarily familiar with, which furthers the intricate character development. Acting was terrific from everyone. Reno's commanding titular performance encapsulated the screen. Portman's debut is quite possibly the best child performance I've seen. And then there's Oldman as the crazed antagonist, who steals every scene. Whilst this is absolutely entertaining, there are obvious issues. The plot is too thin to carry the full runtime, it takes far too much time developing the character relationship where the actual plot feels neglected, leaving the antagonist on the sideline until the third act. Also the music choice occasionally didn't fit the bustling urban environment and took me out of the film. Aside from those points, it's considerably better than most crime dramas and has aged impeccably well. Everyone needs a Léon in their life."
ElMaruecan82,"Jan 15, 2016",9/10,"Luc Besson became the 'it' director ever since he dust French cinema with his 1985 ""Subway"", embracing the 80's as if it was a new millennium, a time where French movies could look American without it being an overused gimmick. And on that level, ""La Femme Nikita"" was his most American-looking film, using archetypes that were even fresh for American audience, interestingly, one of them, from the 1990 hit ""Nikita"", would directly inspire his most critically acclaimed movies.Jean Reno played Victor, the cleaner, a hit-man whose specialty was to kill and get rid of bodies through acid. There was something absolutely fascinating in that scene-stealing character, cutting into the grittiness with a cool naturalness that made us wish he could last longer. I guess Besson felt there was a potential for such a character, A hit-man who shoots, hides behind doors, ducks and throws grenades, who can take two, three men and all of this, fitted Besson's predilection for fast-paced action, plural shots and overuse of traveling and zooming and so on. And what a challenge in terms of characterization!Somehow I like the English title even more than plain ""Leon"" (though ""Le Professional"" was already a classic starring Belmondo). It truly defines Leon, a pro. But he's also a man a bit slow, who drinks milk, takes care of a plant, and loves Gene Kelly. These attributions might feel phony or gratuitous, but they have a point. Reno deliberately made Leon simple-minded and innocent in order to decrease the tension during the intimate scenes between him and Mathilda. He knew if the professional was as vicious in real life as in his job, it would have ruined the movie. So, he played it as someone who'd be in the mindset of a young boy..And on the other side, you have Mathilda, a 12-year old pre-teen, who's seen more than the average kids, she's totally disillusioned, wasted and abandoned in a dysfunctional whose only valuable member is her little brother. Mathilda smokes, sighs, meditates a lot, she exudes the crappiness of life in her words and eyes that betray an inconsolable sadness. When she first meets Leon, she asks him if life is the same for adults, Leon has no encouraging answer. Mathilda is at the messiest time of her life, and somewhere, fate with the hand of a corrupt officer, named Stansfield and played by Gary Oldman, puts Mathilda under the protection of Leon, becoming the closest thing to a friend.And before Mathilda, the only friend Leon had (besides the plant) was a ""mission-giver"" played by Danny Aiello, became a sort of father-model for Leon ever since he came to the USA (hence 'ze' accent). It was time for Leon to turn into a fatherly figure himself. And ""The Professional"" becomes a wonderful coming-of-age story for both Leon and Mathilda, but to think that it's made with violence and sniper lessons as a backdrop makes the whole experience all the more excitingly disturbing. Contrasts make movies, and ""Leon the Professional"" shines with its contrasts.Mathilda is incredibly responsive to Leon's lessons and shows the same interest and curiosity a child would under these circumstances. Leon's action can seem irresponsible, but he's not even capable to answer for himself, he sees himself as the only possible person to provide Mathilda what she needs the most: order and a constructive routine, a reason to be, something to enjoy and affection I guess this is where the trouble starts. Mathilda admits she feels something weird in her guts, she sees Leon as a sort of Oedipal father, there's a weird mix of fascination and attraction. Leon is not interested, as he doesn't even have sexuality in the first place. The plant and the milk gives him an odd purity that prevented the film to shock viewers. Simple, but powerful symbolism!There's something in Natalie Portman that reminds of another child performance from the same year, Kirsten Dunst in ""Interview of the Vampire"", both are girls who've grown up fast, and have the look of adults. And when Mathilda sort of gives 'herself' as if she was ready to lose an innocence, it's the cruel admission that she had already lost it, I can understand why this line was cut, but I disapprove, because it all depends on Leon's reaction, and nothing he says hints an interest. The material is rather touchy but it's the reverse side of what made the story works, the man teaching a girl how to be a sniper and the girl playing a ""guess"" game with him. When Mathilda plays ""Like a Virgin"", it never feels controversial, she's like a teen playing and Leon looks even more childish.It's only when she confronts Stansfield again that she realizes it's not a game, and that indeed some people can be really creepy. ""Do you love life?"" he asks. She nods, ""Good because I have no pleasure taking it out from someone who doesn't care"". Why is the cop so creepily violent? We never know, there are things that are better left unexplained, it's part of this weird emotional experience, where a hit-man is like a guardian angel, and a civil guardian angel a devil, and in this urban chaos, a little girl is lost. Besson might have been perceived as the American French director, he injected European cinema in an American movie and this is why it fascinates so much.It is a love story of some sort, but about a true and tender father-daughter love, it's also a coming of age, an action film, a neo-noir, all of this carried by a wonderful acting trio. And if you look at it without thinking too much of the whole killing and shooting, the film might strike a very sensitive chord, and, it's one of the best of 1994, which is saying a lot."
Calicodreamin,"Oct 21, 2021",10/10,"Loved this movie. The characters were well cast and well acted. The chemistry been Portman and Reno fells authentic and Oldman is perfectly manic. The storyline is unique, there is a tense aura surrounding most of the scenes that heightens the senses."
bberry-183-679569,"Dec 11, 2014",N/A,This movie is a somewhat a filthy movie but the producer of this film and the actors should be honored again today because I truly feel this film has withstood the test of time. I love all the premium late 80's and 90's clothing in this movie as well as the actors accurately portraying a 6% family. I refer to 6% as being the amount of the population in the US living the life style portrayed in this movie. We are a small amount of the population but we definitely had a good time in the 90's. Please somebody go retro and produce more movies like this one with old school special effects. Awesome and thats a word I rarely use.
javold,"Nov 24, 2000",7/10,"Most of the IMDb commentators seem to find no fault in this movie, which I can almost understand.  The acting, directing and dramatics of the picture are almost there, but not quite. Everything that could be good about this film is limited by faulty writing.Acting: Aiello is great in a minor part, but bad writing kills all the efforts of Reno and Oldman and the twelve year old.  Leon's character is very one dimensional, leaving Reno no room to stretch as an actor, unless you count his bad John Wayne bit or his plant stroking.  Oldman plays a comic book character, so he can't help being over the top.  As for the kid, she leaves an impression but her part is simply not believable.Directing:  Besson was writer and director, so any positive points one might give him for directing are canceled out by the completely implausible story and unmemorable dialog.Dramatics:  There were some very good action scenes, but the ""tender"" Lolita scenes I could do without.I give the movie a 7 overall."
SeriousJest,"Feb 11, 2012",6/10,"This is one of those movies that isn't as good as you remember it being 15+ years ago. Many of the action scenes are hokey, and some of acting was cheesy. Portman was amazing, though. Even at 12 years old, you could see the immense talent, beauty, and passion that were waiting to be unleashed upon the world. However, it was a bit disturbing how Besson tried to sex her up in some of the scenes... Ultimately, this film is about redemption, and how true family can sometimes be forged through fire, instead of genes. While it was awesome for its time period, the bar has been raised for movies a great deal in the last 18 years. Therefore, I'd say that this flick is still worth the time to watch it if it's on, but it's no longer a must-see, now that we have True Grit."
mel_farr,"Dec 10, 2002",2/10,"How is this movie in the top 100, let alone the top 250?I will answer my own question and say that apprently most filmgoers do not find the idea of a ""perfect assassin"" turning out to be a good guardian ludicrous.On one hand we have ""Leon"" the ""perfect assassin."" An assassin is someone who kills people for aliving. This is not a nice, responsible adult. Portraying him as a supportive caregiver is insane. Why would he ever take in a 12 year old girl? Because he's lonely? Don't you think this would get in the way of his work? I like the scene where he tells her not to smoke cigarettes. This guy kills people but he's got a problem with cigarettes.I also like the cliched portrayal of his two-faced boss. That's original.Or how about Gary Oldham as a psycho d.e.a. agent...don't get me wrong I think the government is full of psychos, but really would a complete raving psychopath get this far up in the political machinery? I kind of doubt it. His outbursts have to be bad for p.r.And then we come to Natalie Portman's character. A 12 year old orphan thinks it'd be a good idea to move in with an assassin? I guess her parents never told her not to talk to strangers. And then she's going to become an assassin? If your parents had just gotten killed by people you don't even know, would you want to move in with an assassin and become one? Doesn't she have relatives?This film is completely ridiculous. What is even more unbelieveable is that so many of you liked it.2/10"
runamokprods,"Dec 21, 2013",8/10,"Determinedly, odd, over the top and a lot of fun., This strangely sentimental, wonderfully photographed, very violent black comedy is like some demented marriage of a sincere Disney film about a 12 year old girl looking for a father (or, in an intentionally disquieting French twist, a lover), with the over the top darkness of David Lynch, or Kubrick in his ""Dr. Strangelove"" mode, and some John Woo action thrown in for good measure.Sound weird? Well, it is, and there are some huge logic jumps and gaping plot holes. But the film disarms those potential problems by never pretending to be the world as we know it, but creating a heightened, strange, through- the-looking-glass reality where hit men are sweet softies at heart, and New York cops are not only corrupt but openly bat-sh@t insane, gunning down whomever gets in their way with gleeful abandon.Gary Oldman goes way, way over the top as the baddie, and is a blast in the process. Jean Reno creates some real pathos in his sad faced, killer, who is so alone that he's almost child-like in his having to learn to relate to another human, and Natalie Portman gives a shockingly complex performance for an actress so young, playing so tricky a role. A film I could understand someone hating if they didn't get into Besson's decidedly off-beat vibe, but if you go with it, it's that rarest of film creatures, something unique."
MorfenZ,"Sep 12, 2025",9/10,"I don't know how many times I can watch this movie without ever getting bored. With the 4K restoration on physical media, watching it on my home theater felt like a completely new experience-it's a different level of immersion.First of all, this has to be Natalie Portman's greatest performance, and without question one of the greatest child performances in film history. Every emotion she portrays-her playfulness, her sadness, her pain-feels raw and real. It's flawless acting that stays with you long after the movie ends.Then there's Léon himself. He's not just a character; he's one of my all-time favorite assassins, standing right beside John Wick. His quiet presence and subtle humanity make him unforgettable.The plot is timeless-""undyable"" in the best sense. It's a story that could never be remade in the same way, because it's already perfect. And let's not forget Gary Oldman's villain. His performance is legendary, chaotic, and as I've read, much of it was improvised. That unpredictability makes him one of cinema's greatest villains.The direction by Luc Besson is sharp, stylish, and deeply emotional. Léon is more than just an action movie-it's a masterpiece of cinema that will never fade with time."
kalokritik,"May 12, 2025",9/10,"So the movie is LeonThe movie starts off very exciting. The plot centers on two lonelies who meet in a vast and indifferent New York City. Leon is an adult man with childish naivety and trauma, stuck in the moment of his youth when he first became a murderer. Matilda is a girl who hates her life, but after meeting Leon, she learns to love herself and the world around her for the first time.Self-love is like a red thread. One of the key ideas is this theme of self-love and life. Matilda, who has survived a family tragedy, at first does not see the point in her own existence. But thanks to Leon's care and attention, she learns to appreciate life. At the same time, Leon himself is changing: for the first time in a long time, he wants to be happy, to sleep in a bed, for example. Their relationship is not only about saving each other, but also about self-acceptance.One of the key symbols of the film is a plant, which Leon carefully cares for. The flower is not only Leon himself, but also Matilda. As long as the flower is in the pot, it cannot take root and grow properly. So are the heroes, while they live in isolation, their development is limited. The ending, where Matilda plants a flower in the ground, is a symbol of her new beginning, the opportunity to grow up, ""put down roots"" in a normal life.The film constantly features the theme of education and upbringing. Leon was raised by a mafia boss who taught him to live by strict rules, not to change and not to dream. Matilda gets a chance for another life - to go back to school, to grow up outside the criminal world.Justification of violence, sexualization of the heroine. Interestingly, the script was initially more provocative, but thanks to Natalie Portman and Jean Reno, as well as the rewritten script, the focus shifted to platonic relationships.This story is about how important it is to give another person a chance at a normal future, even if he himself missed this chance. The film remains relevant today, causing controversy, reflection and strong emotions."
monamut222,"Aug 12, 2014",N/A,"With enough blood and gore to please any fan of action movies, and a unique love story to please the ladies, this is a great movie for couples to watch together. However, to truly comprehend the beauty of this film, you must see the European Cut.The U.S. version is still a great movie, but it cuts out 24 minutes which contain much of the heart of the movie and most of what makes the film a work of art instead of the usual action fodder. Elements of the story which are only hinted at in the U.S. cut become the centerpiece of the story when the un-cut version is seen.The two main characters are a recently-orphaned girl who is wise beyond her years and a hit-man who is still an innocent. Their relationship unfolds against a backdrop of murder and revenge as director Luc Besson explores issues of age and maturity, good and evil, and the interplay of life, death and love.The acting in this film is superb. Reno has an expressive face which conveys a myriad of emotions with great sensitivity and few words. He is cold as ice as the almost super-human 'professional', but his performance is most moving when he reveals his sensitive side. Watching as his wounded soul slowly begins to heal is enough to touch the heart of any woman, but it is handled so subtly that it never becomes too 'sappy'.In her film debut, Natalie Portman turns in a performance that is beautiful beyond belief. She manages the transition from a frightened child to a woman capable of killing so convincingly that it makes the relationship between she and Leon not only believable, but understandable.Gary Oldman is just the best psycho there is, and it is kind of nice to see him without all the strange makeup for a change. As a dirty cop in this film he personifies evil, and it is a joy to watch him do his thing.The special effects are all you could hope for. Besson does great actions scenes - especially the explosions. There is also a lot of humor and when you throw in the tender love story - this picture has it all!"

Riveting.Reno, the raw talent that he is makes you relaxed one minute with his apparent growing love for the young girl, and the next minute he may be caught extinguishing Oldman's crew in cold blood. Chilling.I am lost for words with this movie. Has one of the greatest endings I have seen in the past 10 years of film critiquing, and not once was I found yearning for more plot or suspense.Your senses are taken everywhere with this picture. Shock, Horror, Empathy, Understanding and Regret. I for one could not see myself becoming intrigued with a cold blooded ruthless killer, but I was. You are drawn into Leon's world and you find yourself trying to understand how his existence in New York has come about.Coupled with an incredible soundtrack, moody and perfectly pitched for this film, you are staring at perhaps one of the best 10 films in the past 15 years.Class Act. Bessons best."

Stoli_Raz_N_7,"Aug 29, 2005",10/10,"Perhaps Luc Besson will one day make another truly great film. Perhaps Reno will once again garner better roles than a French DOI officer battling a giant lizard in New York. But it doesn't matter if they don't.By pairing for this masterful movie the two have produced a film which will definitely live on throughout history long after all of the riff-raff-flicks are lost and forgotten. This film is definitely deserving of a place in the top 50 films of all time.Outstanding performances burn up this stellar flick. If you don't know the show's storyline, here's the short-short version. An immigrant hit-man (Reno) becomes responsible for, and eventually falls in love with a young girl, Mathilda (played marvelously by Natalie Portman) whose family was murdered by a dirty DEA agent (the always superb Gary Oldman) and his team. Our heroic hit-man must protect the girl and avenge her family's death.More than just a compelling action drama, the film focuses its attention on the truth of humanity that people are social creatures and need companionship. While at first Leon is cold and commanding towards his young charge, he eventually warms to her more than he wants to admit to himself. When Mathilda's desire for vengeance places her in harms way, Leon's true feelings burst forth in a hail of bullets and bloodshed that would make the Terminator think twice about messing with this man.The story is solid. The dialogue is honest and pointed. The action is spectacular. And overall, the direction is undoubtedly Besson's best. This film ranks exceptionally high on my All-Time Must-See list."
deepmc,"Jun 28, 2006",10/10,"Most people misinterpret this movie, Leon was not a pedophile. He was a hit-man who obviously has no family and love for no one and he finally finds someone he can care for. It is not really sure how he loves her, but he wouldn't have sex with Matilda. He loves her like a Father would love his Daughter. This is one of the few well made emotional aspect movies that I can actually enjoy. It had everything a movie should have, slight humor, emotion, drama and action and most importantly, love. If you can't respect a well made film like this, then perhaps you shouldn't be on IMDb, trying to offer your two-cents on a movie you know nothing of."
barry_mooney,"Apr 15, 2012",10/10,"Not only have I watched Leon more times than I can remember, but it has already been very well reviewed on here to the extent that there's not much more to add.However, just in case anyone wishes to see a short and to-the-point review; this film is perfect! There are characters you actually care about, there is a beautiful and touching love story, there's a simple but clever plot, there are moments of superb cinematography and there is plenty of action. Want any more...? There's a great ending too!Luc Besson is brilliant but he's not faultless. He has only done one other film that I rated VERY highly (9/10) and that's Angel-A. Both films share the theme of having a very unconventional love story at their heart and both are stunning to behold.Perfect 10/10"
kodiacbear,"Jun 7, 2007",10/10,"The US version of the film is heavily edited, which correspondingly causes the plot to break and makes some scenes seem senseless. I was not a big fan of the US version (it was basically an action film), but really enjoyed the international version. The international version explores the relation between Leon and Natalie Portman.I believe the reason for the censorship is that many Americans consider any sort of a relation between an older man and a younger girl as pedophilia. This is not the case, and, it is a sad reflection on American culture that this is what viewers would see. In a similar vein, Disney refuses to release ""Only Yesterday"" as it contains a few references to the dreaded M word. Hello, aren't we over being Victorians?"
CinemaClown,"Aug 9, 2013",N/A,"A vicious, violent & vengeful delight that grabs the viewers' attention from its opening moments and doesn't let go until the very end, Léon remains one of the finest examples of 90s action cinema that's yet to lose any of its potency and can still rival the best of what its genre has to offer today."
CinephileXpress,"Mar 8, 2023",6/10,"When I first saw that ""Leon: The Professional"" had such a high rating on IMDb, I had high expectations for the film. However, I don't think it lived up to the hype. While it's not a bad movie, it's not as great as people make it out to be. The movie features Jean Reno playing the role of a highly skilled and efficient assassin. But the plot takes a strange turn when he forms a bond with a young girl and becomes her foster father. It's hard to believe that a ruthless killer would suddenly take on a nurturing role, and even more difficult to believe that he would train her to become a killer as well.In addition to the issues with the plot, I also found some of the character portrayals in the movie to be problematic. Natalie Portman's character, in particular, was a bit too much for me. The way she was dressed and act throughout the film made her look like something else, which was unnecessary and inappropriate for a child actor. Moreover, the relationship between her character and Leon was uncomfortable for me to watch. At times, it seemed like the filmmakers were trying to portray a romantic connection between them, which was inappropriate considering the age difference and power dynamic between the characters."
lastliberal-853-253708,"Apr 5, 2013",9/10,"It is easy to praise the father-daughter relationship that Leon (Jean Reno) and Mathilda (Natalie Portman) display in this dark and compelling film, but I feel that would be superficial.The relationship appeared to be much deeper - almost sexual - as the two tried to find some meaning in their lives.Leon was just slouching through life doing his job and not caring about much else. A wired cop (Gary Oldman) thrust Mathilda into his arms, and he became her protector and trainer. This relationship unfolded slowly and beautifully and was truly a joy to watch.Sure, there was action, but it framed the story, which was really about Leon and Mathilda. Reno and Portman were brilliant and aptly supported by Oldman and Danny Aiello."
rod-ruger,"May 6, 2015",1/10,"Really, who enjoys a pap movie like this? Illiterate, supposedly cold-hearted 40 year old killer who drinks lots of milk (what's milk got to do with anything - movie was funded by the dairy lobby?) befriends a 12 year old girl whose family (all morons who deserve death) was gunned down by a lunatic drug dealer and his gang. I suppose giving the girl a place to live was OK. However, to teach her how to kill? Come on! No evidence that she went to school. I could not watch more after an hour and only lasted that long because people gave it good reviews. I assumed something almost intelligent or exciting would happen. Lots of sad music backed scenes of people doing nothing. If one cut out the dull moments, this movie would last 10 minutes, if that. I stopped after the girl professed her love for the killer. This movie, as many others that receive high marks, is an IQ test. If you liked it, you failed the test."
stephwereley,"Jun 22, 2004",10/10,"I'd always heard good things about this film and finally saw it for myself. I loved it. Although I didn't like the violent bits, I recommend seeing it. There are even a few light-hearted scenes to provide commit relief. And Natalie Portman is great in it. By the end I found myself emotionally attached to the characters- particularly Leon, the killer with a soft spot. And Gary Oldman has that whole psycho-killer thing going on that he does so well- he's so much fun to watch on screen. Now I want to see the director's cut, which contains twenty minutes of extra footage. It has a few extras that they didn't want North American audiences to see."
Scotty_Ranking,"Apr 1, 2005",9/10,"Wow! This was one of the first non-classic movies hat just blew me away!!!!!! Back in '94 when it was released, it was a welcome change from the 'senseless violence' flicks that Hollywood started to churn out in droves. The movie featured a compelling plot, well-cast actors and some very riveting performances.The basic root of this story - a killer with a soft heart - was probably the best executed example of its kind. Jean Reno nailed his portrayal as Leon; a professional hit-man whose relationship (not sexual, mind you) with a young girl forces him to re-examine his inner youth/lost child that his harsh life had robbed him of all those years ago..Gary Oldman was a little over-the-top drama king as the dirty cop villain, but I don't think anyone could have done it better, especially when his character took actions under the influence of drugs.I believe this was Natalie Portman's theatrical debut, and boy was she convincing! I don't think there are that many young actresses who can vividly portray the emotions and suffering that here character had to go through given the story that played out.The cinematography was superb, the effects well done (not overdone), and I'd recommend this movie for almost anyone to see, regardless of preferences!!!!!"
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Aug 12, 2008",10/10,"Leon is one of the most perfect films made in recent times.It is a film which will be remembered for its frankness in glorifying meaningful violence which has become an integral part of human lives. Apart from his awesome grip on violence,French director Luc Besson has given all possible chances to his actors to display richness of human emotions.Leon is also the best testimony to the fact that tough guys are innocent souls at heart.This is true in the case of Leon as violence may be his profession but feelings,plants and people are his real interests.Jean Reno is excellent as professional killer Leon who sacrifices his life for saving Mathilda,a role played by Nathalie Portman.She looks great as a street smart,slick young girl who decides to make violence her way of life after her family is ruthlessly killed by Norman Stansfield,a character played by British actor Gary Oldman. All those who know New York well will not be disappointed as their city has not been shown in a poor light."
Bon_Jovi_chick,"Nov 27, 2003",10/10,"I only bought this film a few days ago because Gary Oldman was in it. I never realised what a masterpiece it was. Jean Reno, Natalie Portman and Gary Oldman are all brilliant in this wonderful triangle.Is there a role that Gary Oldman cannot pull off with style? Even in his poorer films such as LOST IN SPACE, he is still able to bring it to a watchable level. This is definetly in my top 5 favourite Gary Oldman films.I found the love bit (what Mathilde feels for Leon) a bit dodgy but hey the girl is 12- her emotions were running wild!Definetly worth a buy and it deserve its place in the IMDB Top 250 films of all time!"
philip_vanderveken,"Nov 20, 2004",10/10,"Léon is one of my favorite movies of all time although I'm not a fan of action movies at all. I've seen it already so many times and still I can't get enough of it. I don't know what it is that makes this movie so attractive. I guess it is because of the great acting by all actors and the fact that Besson has made a really surprising movie with characters who aren't what you would expect.Léon is a professional hit man, but he isn't cold hearted as you might think. He's a nice man who doesn't know how to read, who only drinks milk and who's best friend is a plant... Admit it, that's not what you would expect from a hit man. The same for Matilda, the 12-year old girl that he protects since her family was blown to pieces by a crazy Beethoven-loving drug lord. She's only 12, but she already acts like an adult and she wants to become a ""cleaner"" like Léon so she can take revenge on her little brother's murderers.This movie isn't just an action movie or a thriller. It's also a drama with a lot of comedy. You might think this wouldn't work out well, but it does. Don't ask me how, but Besson has made a solid movie out of it that will grab you by the throat from the first minute on, not to let you go until hours after it finished... This is what people call a masterpiece I guess. 10/10."
natelambert-38242,"Jul 3, 2024",6/10,"Leon is a good movie, but it doesn't deserve to be in the top 100 on IMDB. The film is very well shot and scored, and this, coupled with the performances by Jean Reno and Natalie Portman, serves as the movie's highlights. Danny Aiello also does a nice job with Tony's character. However, the basis for the story is too unrealistic. Yes, shady cops exist; however, they don't just get to murder entire families without consequences. It tries too hard to make Gary Oldman's character seem completely insane. He has a very overstated performance. This is what breaks the film for me. It's a good movie to watch with your girlfriend, but very far from cinematic excellence."
kipconlon,"Dec 23, 2002",1/10,"Are any of us happy we responded so enthusiastically to La Femme Nikita that we now have to sit through shiny garbage like The Fifth Element and the Professional?  Wow, this movie's stupid.  The movie begins attempting no nonsense-realism by choosing gritty, not picturesque parts of the city, as well as chucking in the pretty gratuitous murder of a child to make it that much more ""edgy"", and then the movie just becomes an orgy of gun-worship and impersonal murder, strung together by a silly, yet sickening plot, where this mass murderer's (Leon) really kind of cute and avuncular when babysitting this heavily made up 12 year old.  Hey, he drinks milk!  How bad could he be?  And he refuses to shoot women and children!  What a guy!  I, being an adult male, he would happily kill given the business opportunity, but serves me right for not being a woman or child.  In the course of the plot he teaches this alarmingly sophisticated neighbor girl how to be like him, how to kill strangers.   Ahhh.  The ""lessons"" he offers her, the tricks of his trade are chestnuts you'd  never ever think of like, ""relax.  keep your eye on him.""  I would have thought panic and look away, so shows what I know!  And not like I'm mister puritanical, but something quite pronouncedly creepy is at least SUPPOSED to be going on in this film, I have never seen a child quite so ""advertised"" which is an extremely sleazy thing to be half-heartedly suggesting in your half-baked movie about the lovable hitman and orphan annie who likes to sing ""Like A Virgin"" and dress up as Marilyn Monroe.  Which reminds me--the abysmal humor that appears throughout the film, is that like a trademark with this guy?  ""The Fifth Element"" had an equally annoying cute streak.  Lastly, if you really watch Jean Reno, forgetting he's French and interesting looking, his performance is pretty rank amateur.  He really looks even more lost than the lovable murdering dope he's supposed to be playing.  They also refer to him in the film as Italian, which he's clearly French.  Does the French director not know what French accents sound like?  Gary Oldman is laughabale, at best, and that really is almost a compliment, or as close to one as this thing deserves."
leplatypus,"Sep 20, 2010",10/10,"Funny but Natalie comes from natale, thus the birth of Christ, thus Christmas or Noel in french!Seriously, for her first feature, she got a wonderful gift and was able to give in return a tremendous acting! I don't know for others stars but at her age of 13, she shows that she can cry and laugh and express all the feelings between with an evident talent! That's the kind of interpretation that hooked me for life. Her Mathilda character is very valuable because i find ""beauty"" in compassion, fragility and funny spirit. Those give us great moments of movies: the ring at the gateway, the disguise game, ... It was great to see how she can lead Reno (who isn't a soft man), how he can lead her on the final battle and how she is dismissed by Aiello.I think the movie owes a lot to Reno as well and also to Besson. For the legend, it was him who found Natalie and gave her a chance, it was him who nurtured the cast with such grace (and that was him who directed the movie. If i like American movies in France, french movie in America are scarcer and indubitably, Besson has brought his French touch: i have never seen New York like this and his camera is alive, wide open, a mix between De Palma and Lynch! The opening credit is an homage to this ""Big Blue"" with the shock of civilization (we even saw the Twin Towers).I don't know if a ""Lolita"" vision is acute here but i think that anlecture that links unconsciously the flower as a feminine womb and the milk as a male semen add very powerful sense to the relationship!A unique masterpiece in conclusion all the worth that a sequel seems highly unlikely."
kurciasbezdalas,"Dec 4, 2008",10/10,"I saw this film many years ago and as I remember I liked it, though it did seemed to me like anything special. It appeared to me like another action film about hit-man. I many times heard other people talking how great this film is and I couldn't understand how this movie is different from others. Now after few years I've watched it again, and now I realised it. Back then I was into action movies, so I've watched movies only to see some action, I didn't care much about a plot. This movie has some impressive action sequences, which were so beautifully filmed, that every minute of it was very enjoyable. But action isn't the most important thing about this film. What's important is an original story about unusual relationships between contract killer and a teenage girl. What else is good about this film is the colorfulness of it. Jean Reno was typical Jean Reno and that's good, he made a pretty original hit-man. Even more I liked Gary Oldman's performance, he always plays bad guys in movies so well, I think the movie would be much worse, if Stansfield was played by other guy."
mh_yan,"Jul 7, 2002",10/10,"I have actually seen the cut version of Leon couple of yrs back and though it did impressed me then, it was not until I have seen it again on video that it captivated me !  Since then I think I must have seen it more than 30 times ? And every time I have re-watch it, it will seem like I am watching it for the first time and the anticipation is still there, that's how good the movie is for me.I am excited as after so many yrs, this movie is still talked about.The story plot is interesting to watch as it unfolds showing how Leon does his work professionally without having to worry about other things and later how his life is changed by Mathilda.The directing is superb by Luc Besson and the music by Eric Serra sets the mood for each scene, intensifying the story.Jean Reno's role as Leon is also superb as it brings out the character of Leon.  Jean Reno is a great actor and he is believable in the roles he plays, he can be funny as in comedies (Just visiting) but serious/cool in others (Leon/Ronin/La grand Bleu).Natalie Portman is a natural actor who holds well in the role of Mathilda."
dyaaisguo,"Oct 9, 2013",N/A,"I saw the Leon. The story is that a lonely assassin ""Leon"" meets a girl ""Mathilda"" who lives in next door, and his life changes because of her. I would like to introduce my favorite scene of this movie.The best scene, I think, is that Leon faced to conflict whether he let Mathilda into his room in the head of this movie. This is because I think that this scene is the point that he and she got the human emotion, which is love. I couldn't know why he doesn't get to love anyone, but she was abused by her family except for her little brother, so she couldn't get to love anyone. After meeting each other, their life gets colored by changing from what they were. Besides being a daughter, she was a lover. Besides accepting his order as a daughter, she claimed to behave as a lover. I feel so interested in such changes of heart between him and her, so I chose this scene."
StevePunchard,"Mar 30, 2022",7/10,"It might be because of the cool sunglasses he wears. Or because he, as a killer, has a heart which lots of killers do and the people he kills were all bad guys. We like him because he's a simple person (but also because he's a very good killer). The girl is simple too just wanting to move on with life.So why, as rated by my fellow rating persons, is this movie ranked #33 BEST OF ALL TIME (out of close to 1M IMDb titles)? I will agree it's well acted, has a compelling story line and is cute but really! 33! It's good, but not THAT good.About the story, the plant lives. Watch it once, enjoy, then move on."
July_Faraday,"Apr 2, 2014",9/10,"I've been postponing watching this movie for a long time, I guess I tend to judge movies by the cover... but I was very wrong, it was one of the best movies I've ever seen. The chemistry is so obvious between Matilda and Leon since the first scene they share together. The character development is so amazing, shows that human emotions are strongest and can soften even the toughest man. I believe this movie has one of the gentlest and purest love story in history of movies and portrayed to perfection.I haven't seen a movie that awakens such nice emotions and sympathy than this one; If you haven't seen it, please do so, you will be amazed;"
dalton2,"Oct 10, 1998",7/10,"This is one of those strange films where people who are supposed to be 'bad guys' are actually the 'good guys' in the story. Léon is a professional killer who can't do anything but kill. He's almost perfect when he works, but has one weak point: women and children. I don't know if such a character is possible in real life, and I'm not sure about the message of the film, if there's any, but the fact is that I find good acting, good music and a film with which you don't get bored. My rating is 7 out of 10."
Shipep15201,"Jul 10, 2006",4/10,"The movie was watchable, but that's about it. Why the hell it's ranked this high on IMDb I cannot understand. Maybe most of us saw it as kids and remembered it as being entertaining then, but for any film-buff, this is no better than movies such as Completely overrated film; nothing was special about the cinema visually nor was the plot that enthralling or original. Natalie Portman, who always pretty much sucks in movies, was apparently even worse as a young actress. This movie is on par with any other cliché ""assassin"" oriented flick. It seemed like a TV movie when I saw it on TBS. I couldn't BELIEVE it was on the IMDb top 250."
Clintborari,"Dec 6, 2022",10/10,"Leon: The Professional is an absolute magnum opus of cinema, and gave me chills watching It. Its story is complex and riveting, and its theme echo's the realism of living a lonely, unhappy life.This story of a man's journey to be able to find an emotional connection, and new meaning in his life thanks to Mathilda is heartwarming and satisfying.I have seen nowadays that controversy seems to surround every classic released in the past in one way or another, it festers on destroying what was real, and had a soul, and in this film that involves the connection between Leon and Mathilda.In all honestly, people need to open their minds to reality. And see how deep and meaningful people can be. This is what happens in life, and these are the feelings of young people who are affected by traumatic incidents in their past towards mature adults which leaves them a little confused and vulnerable.It's a shame that topics like this get sensationalised, but luckily it takes absolutely nothing away from the performances within the film.Going off Luc Besson's personal life, the relationships could easily be considered a truer story in a lot of ways that could potentially delve deep into a person's past.The language, the scenery, and the dialogue all just seem so natural. It's so relaxing to be visually satisfied to see the personal growth, and development of Mathilda, the good intentions, and the human side of Léon.The devotion you form with the characters is emotionally moving, and the performances show such naturalism in their roles, that it feels like these are ordinary people, having to deal with extraordinary circumstances. It grabs your attention and gives you a sentimental attachment to the story.The acting was phenomenal. Gary Oldman (Norman Stansfield) has played a villain that will be remembered for the ages. He was so charismatic, calm, cool, collected, and vile that you detested, and feared him. When he is on screen he captures your attention and draws you in so intently that every scene feels like something sinister is just about to happen.This was Natalie Portman's platform to the big time. I have seen her in countless films and always regarded her highly as an actress. But this was something different. To play such a controversial, emotional, and demanding part would be tough for even the best performers and she handled herself extraordinarily.When I rate a film a 10. It means that it emotionally touching, and leaves my mind swimming with many thoughts, theories, ideas and new sensations. And finally, it leaves me feeling the utmost satisfaction or pure joy of being able to see something truly remarkable, and astonishing. I sometimes even dwell on the plot for days or even weeks after the film has ended.No spoilers in this review. If you had a choice to watch just one film on your bucket list then Leon: The Professional would be one of my first choices.10/10."
balafaras,"Aug 11, 2015",9/10,"I have a quite specific criteria for rating a movie. It is by how memorable it is. It is by how much it shows you moments, dialogs, situations that get into your mind and which you think over and over again after the movie, without necessarily finding a deep philosophical meaning in them. Moments that left you enough of an impression to force you review and analyze them thoroughly. This film gives me what I am looking for. Leon and Mathilda are excellent characters and you really embrace their personalities, their spirit, their hardships, you watch their actions with agony and feel their will for carrying on in a cruel,unforgiving world. Stansfield is also excellent as the villain and shows the other side of the coin, that is how easy it is to fall into immorality and how much power that can give you in the system we live today. Go and watch that movie. I promise it will be memorable."
foalborn,"Jul 20, 2014",10/10,"I consider myself as a fan of action movies and movies in general. When i first saw this movie i thought it was just incredible to see Natalie Portman so young and acting so well. After seen it like 10 times i realize that Gary Oldman is a genius, Jean Reno's role has an unique personality and the hole movie is just amazing. Is one of those movies you love even more when you saw it again. Like a the fifth time you see it you can start appreciating some details, like the music or even the sounds. It reminds me the old action films where you thought everything was very meticulous and done with experts before great technology appeared. Movies like Die Hard, those you appreciate because the story is really original and the characters can trap you and question your beliefs."
dylanwhaley,"Oct 27, 2021",10/10,"My number 4 favorite all time. About 30 minutes were cut out of the theater cut and they are some of the best scenes in the film. Natalie Portman and jean reno are great. Perfect chemistry but honestly they are outshined by Gary oldman who plays a corrupt, drug addicted DEA agent. His performance is almost proto's Heath Ledger's joker in my opinion lol. Very unique crime drama thriller. Couldn't recommend it more. Especially the directors cut!"
leonakai,"Oct 2, 2023",10/10,"It's a very sad story, especially at the end of the movie. I loved this movie because of the great actors (Jean Reno, Natalie Portman, Gary Oldman) who made me believe in the story and feel the deepness. I loved it because of the great cinematography, well-chosen soundtrack and lovely story. I like the sad ending just because it has to be sometimes, Luc knew what he wanted from the audience and he made it brilliantly, I finished watching this movie drying my eyes. It was a deep dive for me and I need some time to get back to my own life. Based only on this feeling I can call it a great movie and recommend to watch."
Hey_Sweden,"Feb 1, 2023",7/10,"The too-cool-for-words French actor Jean Reno plays the title role, a hitman earning a living in NYC. One of his neighbors is the precocious Mathilda (Natalie Portman, in her film debut), who lives with trashy parents, a foul-tempered sister, and one innocent, her baby brother. Then one day, crooked, psychotic, and pill-popping D. E. A. Agent Stansfield (Gary Oldman) and his crew wipe out the rest of Mathildas' family. She finds a safe haven living with Leon, and becomes obsessed with the thought of revenge. She URGES him to teach her the tricks of his trade; with great reluctance, he becomes her mentor and father figure.Written and directed by Luc Besson (who'd made a big splash with ""La Femme Nikita"" previously), ""Leon"" is not without its share of problems. For one thing, it can get pretty ridiculous at times; master stylist Besson is not exactly going for gritty reality here. Also, some of the scenes with Leon and Mathilda, who's obviously in TOO much of a hurry to grow up (and who thinks she loves Leon), are very uncomfortable. (This, despite the fact that we can sense that Leon is a basically good man who won't take advantage of her.) It also threatens to go off the rails because of Oldman, whose performance is often quite over the top. (His ""EVERYOOOONE!"" scene has become iconic over the years.)All of this said, the film is a compelling combination of dark elements, drama, humor, action (""Leon"" gets operatically violent at times), and tension. What really makes the difference is that Reno has such presence on screen, and his rapport with young Portman, who likewise gives such a natural performance for a beginner that it's as if she'd been acting for years. Reno chose to play Leon as a simple-minded, almost childlike man, one who dotes on a plant and loves movie musicals, and this makes him quite appealing. They're supported by a number of familiar faces: Danny Aiello as Tony, the guy who gives Leon his assignments, Ellen Greene and Michael Badalucco as Mathildas' parents, and George Martin, Kent Broadhurst, and Robert LaSardo.Most amusing is the montage of assassinations where Leon and Mathilda are working as a team.Seven out of 10."
gberger,"Dec 28, 2002",3/10,"Others have described the awful plot, so let me just get to the point. I don't know how this film ever got rated so highly. Pseudo art film cinematography can't compensate for cartoon characters and a plot out of a comic book. Nor can a precocious and talented 13-year old actress uttering total nonsense. Wow, what a bomb!"
Screen_Blitz,"Jul 16, 2017",9/10,"From French director Luc Besson, Leon: The Professional is an action film with a little more to bargain than a just a plethora of explosive action set pieces. It is a part-drama that strives for a sheer exploration in its characters and how their lives are changed when everything goes downhill. The alarming question implemented in this story is what would you be willing to do to protect someone who has seemingly lost everything. The answers lie within Besson's chillingly crafted action vehicle which bears a story of a relationship between a man with demons burning inside him and a preteen girl lost in a world of inconspicuous innocence, and their relationship is the emotional crux that activates the film's momentum. Making up the duo is French-born actor Jean Reno and young actress Natalie Portman, a youngster making her feature film debut. The performances along with Besson's uncompromising direction makes not a comfortable ride, but one that is nearly unforgettable. This film follows Leon (played by Jean Reno), an Italian-born immigrant and professional hit-man working under mobster Tony (played by Danny Aiello), who meets Mathilda (played by Natalie Portman), a lonely 12-year old girl living under the harsh conditions of her abusive father (played by Michael Badalucco), her snappy mother, her equally older sister, and her younger brother who seems to be only pleasant seed in the family. Mathilda spends her days smoking on the balcony and looking for work to do. When Leon witness the brutal murder of her family at the hands of gun-wielding goons lead by mob boss Stansfield (played by Gary Oldman), Leon reluctantly takes her under his wing and teaches her the basics of becoming a professional assassin. Along the way, an unexpected platonic relationship forms between the two.Many actions film set out to entertain audiences with explosive special effects and hyperkinetic atmosphere, but not in a way that this film does. Luc Besson eludes against the common action formula in favor for a more art-house approach, a method that transcends the movie into something more thoughtful, if not masterful. Besson is not quick to just jump straight into the action and lead the scene with loud, heart-stopping gun shootouts. He takes his steady time to dive deep into the characters including establishing their backgrounds and compound personalities, while accompanying the scenery with a riveting score by Eric Serra. The eponymous character Leon is portrayed as a man with brutality written on his forehead. He is a man who shoots and kills to survive against the evildoers who wrong him. But deep inside the mysterious man is a gentle soul who wishes for a peaceful life. His is solidly exhibits in scenes showing his loves for plants and of course, in more light-hearted scenes with Natalie Portman's Mathilda. When the two finally eventually form their bond, that is when the story strikes at the heart. Easily making their relationship uncomfortable to grasp would obviously be their hefty age difference, yet that is what makes things more interesting. Reno's performance really hits hard in soft scenes when he and Portman are bonding, as well as the more grim moments when he shows off his gripping ferocity when he is mowing down the bad guys. Along his side is Portman who, for her surprisingly young age, brightens the room with a gritty portrayal that wrings out maturity and humanity of her character. And the duo must come face-to-face with Stansfield who is granted with a vicious, yet enticingly strong portrayal by Gary Oldman. The tension between him and the title character greatly pays its dues in climatic action sequence at the end when the body count hits the towers and each character faces a blind date with fate.Leon: The Professional is a powerfully crafted action-drama hybrid by Luc Besson who takes the action genre and spins into a visceral cinematic treat. Besson proves himself as a filmmaker capable to wringing out true heart from a genre filled populated with big- budget action parades. It is an admirable piece of work, at least for those who can get past the violent nature of the story."
ariazarei2004,"Sep 13, 2024",10/10,"I am a person who gets very emotional personally, and there are few things in this world that can evoke my true emotions. One of those very powerful things is the acting of this little girl that makes my heart skip a beat and makes me feel something that I can't talk about. How is it possible for a girl at such a young age to present such a strong performance? I feel that this girl never acted in this movie and she was her real self in the whole movie. I loved this very strong and deep movie and it is at the top of my movie list. I hope that every person who can feel as little as I can, by watching this movie, can taste a little taste of the deep feeling that I felt and it doesn't even have a name. But I will say this, this deep sensation isn't supposed to be pleasant, it's just supposed to remind you that you're alive and breathing. And this deep painful feeling, in addition to being close to the door, shows you the deep meaning of human contact with life. Unpleasant like life, but necessary."
MilosH18,"Oct 31, 2021",10/10,"Exciting, stylish, and emotional. Besson's vision was spot on as he created one of the strongest bonds in film character history. Masterpiece performances by the cast."
millerangela-51038,"Sep 10, 2023",10/10,"The actors were perfectly cast in this film. Plus, it was so well written that you cannot pull yourself away. It blurs the line between heroes and criminals. Who, in their right mind would pull for a little girl to become an assassin? But somehow it works. I enjoyed every minute of it, and was not able to predict what would happen next. It's so interesting watching Natalie Portman when she was so young. But you can tell she is incredibly talented. Her character's background story is told in a way that you can really believe that she would be so desperate to want to become a killer, and want to be mentored by a deranged yet kind ""cleaner."" Definitely watch this film unless the violence is a stumbling block for you."
T-Karrde,"Oct 9, 2003",N/A,"Ok, it seems like I'm going against the grain here, but after watching Leon: The Professional (Widescreen DVD: International ver) I was very discontented.  For starters, I was introduced to the movie with the understanding that it was an action flick, it wasn't.  I was told that I would really care about the characters, I didn't.  Here's the deal:Gary Oldman is one of my favorite actors.  I like him to play villains and in this movie he does a very well job.  He's evil, clever and extremely threatening.  Unfortunately, his character is given little screen time.Natalie Portman shows that she is a great actress.  After seeing what I believe is her first film I can understand why she could have a successful film career in front of her.Jean Reno.  Um....He seems to do as much as he can with the role.  I like him in other films but there's not a lot you can do with a character who seems extremely smart at times but mentally retarded at others.The movie starts out great but comes to a screeching halt about 1/4 of the way through then climbs back up to about 3/4 speed towards the end. Matilda's relationship with Leon is strained and borders pedophilia. Matilda continually advances on Leon sexually.  Could this film not have accomplished the feeling of comradely without the thought of a sexually active 12 year old attempting to seduce a 35ish year old man?Other than that major plot dampener, we are continually bombarded with silly things that do little if nothing to the story. (Such as Matilda dressing up like Madonna, Marilyn & Charlie Chaplin.) Her continual use of the F-bomb is annoying and after the first 10 times she says it you start to ask yourself if you like this little girl of if she's just annoying.  Luc Besson does add some clever camera movements into the film as well as some interesting and funny characteristics into Leon.All in all I found myself glancing away from the screen and checking just how long the movie had been running on the LCD read out.  The painfully predictable ending was just that, painful.  If you have nothing to do on a Monday night when it's raining outside and there's nothing on, then watch Leon: The Professional.  But keep the remote handy with your finger on Fast Forward.  You'll probably need it."
futuretype,"Mar 7, 2018",7/10,"Having not heard of this film much less seen it before now (I was living in the jungle (rainforest to you) for several years when it came out) I was gobsmacked by how many people rated it and rated it highly. I appreciated the lower end reviews near the end and am embarrassed I gave it a seven but I was riveted by the movie when I was not thinking how ridiculous it was. But then aren't Star Wars, Indian Jones et al just as ridiculous? If I can ""accept"" a starship making noise through warp space why not an erratic DEA agent and a twelve year old wanna be assassin?"
davidgomere,"Apr 19, 2019",10/10,"A poignant, stylish thriller showing the unusual relationship between a professional assassin and a young girl who's family was murdered. It is moving, tense and entertaining, everything a thriller like this should be."
Catupiry,"May 19, 2015",6/10,"I don't understand all the hype about this movie,there are absolutely nothing special about it, the main idea of the movie was already used before! there are some really ""hollywoodian"" scenes that are frustrating to see how much fake it is, and not only the action scenes; I don't think that a 12 year old girl that smokes would be amazed by that piggy excuse to make the movie more sentimental. At least there are some good acting, Gary Oldman did a nice job; Jean Reno was also nice; Natalie Portman was good enough for a child. But, in compensation, there are some really bad actors that ruins most of the good acting."
Eskisehirlii,"Jun 15, 2023",10/10,"I have just finished watching it and it became one of my favorite movies so far. Gary Oldman acted so well that he shined even though he didn't have that much minutes in the movie compared to the 2 main characters.Leon and Mathilda probably has one of the most interesting and awkward relation dynamics out of all the movies out there. Even though they have absolutely different personalities and perspectives of life, it makes the viewer smile that they both could find common interests in that small house of theirs.The movie successfully completes its mission to create a different kind of mood swing through every scene as the movie as a whole could be identified by different genres."
LaPresti1,"Jan 1, 2023",9/10,"Director: Luc BessonActors: Jean Reno, Gary Oldman and Natalie PortmanMy Points: 9,2 / 4,5Well, first; this might be the best movie ever - for my opinion. Then second, this is just an awesome movie!The chemistry between Jean Reno and Natalie Portman is awesome. Not forgetting Gary Oldman, hes maybe the best role ever.The good parts? Well, I liked the milk -& plant portion. The guessing game was fun. Sniper scene were also cool (and nice)!The end scene shooting out were also very well done, I liked it very much. The anti-drugs view was good.Overall an awesome movie, the ending were pretty damn good - both what happened to Jean -& Natalies character.If you havent seen this movie yet, it's about a pretty good time to see it! Maybe it will become your favorite movie, liked it is mine."
guyzradio,"Oct 6, 2021",9/10,"I watched it on a lark and walked away amazed. It is Natalie Portman's first movie. When they finished filming, they must have realized what a talent she is. It was like watching Jody Foster in Taxi Driver. Every other role perfectly played, including Gary Oldman whose character is a bit off the rails. It's a magnificent flick, beautifully directed. See it!"
yanggg,"May 25, 2014",9/10,"From Amazon.co.uk Luc Besson (The Fifth Element) made his American directorial debut with this stylised thriller about a French hit man (Jean Reno) who takes in an American girl (Natalie Portman) being pursued by a corrupt killer cop (Gary Oldman). Oldman is a little more unhinged than he should be, but there is something genuinely irresistible about the story line and the relationship between Reno and Portman. Rather than cave in to the cookie-cutter look and feel of American action pictures, Besson brings a bit of his glossy style from French hits La Femme Nikita and Subway to the production of The Professional, and the results are refreshing even if the bullets and explosions are awfully familiar.--Tom Keogh Product Description Léon: The Professional (French: Léon; Original U.S.: The Professional) is a 1994 English- language French thriller film written and directed by Luc Besson. It stars Jean Reno as the titular mob hit-man; Gary Oldman as corrupt DEA agent Stansfield; a young Natalie Portman, in her feature film debut, as Mathilda, a 12-year-old girl who is taken in by the hit-man after her family is murdered; and Danny Aiello as Tony, the mobster who gives the hit-man his assignments."
chaam-lifestyle,"Oct 25, 2014",10/10,"This is definitely one of my all times favorite movie! If I could give more than 10, I would. This is truly a masterpiece.Nothing is too much or not enough in this movie. There's just a delightful balance here. You will be blown away by Nathalie Portman's performance. It's hard to believe that she was just a 13 years old girl back then. Prepare yourself to get attached and even fell in love with the main character played by Jean Reno; the heartless hit-man who's a lone wolf will open up along the movie in a very subtle way when he takes that little girl under his protection. Let's not forget about the bad guy of the movie (because every decent movie has one) and what a bad guy! Even if Gary Oldman's really pulls out an amazing performance, it's impossible to hate him. I've never loved a bad guy as much as this one. Luc Besson's old movies (Nikita, the fifth element) are stunner's and this one definitely belongs to that category.I hope this made you wanted to watch the movie, I promise you won't be disappointed and I hope you'll have as much pleasure as i have when watching it for the first time."
bob the moo,"Oct 17, 2001",N/A,"Generally a love story about a 40 year old man who lives by himself and a 12 year old girl would go down about as well as a porkpie at a Jewish wedding with cries of paedophilia from far and wide.  However Leon is just that - a love story, everything else is incidental or situation, and has become a modern classic.What makes this work is that Leon is the 40 year old but appears more naive and childlike, while Mathilda is the grown up in a 12 year old's body - a modern version of Lolita.  The love between them is a pure love, like the relationship between two children, where Leon protects Mathilda and cares for her and Mathilda provides a life that fills the cold existence of Leon's hitman-focused lifestyle.Portman is excellent in this role - she has yet to do anything better, Reno is well cast and handles the opening up of his character in a very believable fashion - he is totally convincing as a killer and a nervous child making friends for the first time.  Oldman overacts like a madman!  If you look closely at his shirt sleeves you'll see his cuff links are actually pineapple rings because he's such a big ham!  His performance doesn't sit well beside the others and he seems to be in a different movie at times. However he does bring a cold killer element with it that works well and offsets his eccentricities.A classic love story, look beyond the guns at the two central performances and you'll see one of the most beautiful relationships in modern films.  The ending will fill you with happiness and break your heart in equal measure."
charchuk,"Feb 19, 2008",6/10,"When it works, it really works. Reno is great, Portman is impressive, the two have great chemistry, and the action scenes are exhilarating. When it doesn't work, though, it really doesn't work. Oldman is basically playing the same role he was stuck with throughout the 90s (though he gives it his all), the direction is bland and damn near amateurish, the whole film looks cheap, and the core relationship, while developed well, leaves a bad taste in one's month. A little too much awkward sexual tension. I think the problem is that Portman's role was written for someone older, and, as such, she just seems too young. It's rather overrated, and it's also dated by some terrible, terrible music choices."
educallejero,"Mar 13, 2021",1/10,"The characters are ridiculously cartoonish, because the important part here is the fantasy about a romance between a childish adult man and a ""mature for her age"" young girl.But with a pathetically basic story poorly developed (if developed at all), bad dialogue (for the most part), romantic scenes in the middle of cold ""ugly"" violence, and surreal characters that suck and have no grow or depth (or both), this is just a poorly done fantasy instead of the exploration of a complicated or questionable relationship."
alicedacosta,"Dec 30, 2020",9/10,"This is a great movie. I definitely enjoyed the fact that the storyline wasn't so predictable and stereotypical. Instead it kept me on my toes, especially with that ending. I was blown away when I first learnt that this was Natalie Portman's first movie. She did so well! The performance from each and every character was astounding and gripping. Gary Oldman! There's no words to explain how thrilling and exciting it was to watch him act. It certainly made the movie even more worthwhile."
lachezarmatneshliev,"Oct 1, 2024",9/10,"Ah, monsieur, you can lead a Frenchman to the Big Apple, but you can't make him a New Yorker and that's exactly what makes The Professional so fascinating. Oldman is the least constructed expectable actor of his generation, and as this deranged detective, he keeps absolutely nothing in reserve. Few action films can claim such complexities without conceding the bang-bang stuff that brings in the big money. Besson's visuals are, as always, vibrant and decidedly. With some surprisingly strong character interaction, there's a lot to like about this movie, at least for those willing to look beyond all the bloodshed. The sheer oddness of the New York world for this film where cops and crooks are literally stranded in roles that pick over the leavings of earlier parts..!?"
jamesgoves,"Sep 5, 2012",9/10,"I love this film. I loved it when I saw it in the 90s and I love it today. In fact, after watching it again 5 or 6 years ago, we named our first born son Leon because of this film. He's not chosen a career path yet...No spoilers here, just to say if you like gritty and cinematic but great acting and quirky, disturbing yet somehow still believable characters mostly mixed up by chance and misfortune in a great story. Then this is for you.I also noticed some people giving it a rating of 1 because they felt it was a 7.5 not an 8.7...please don't do that, you idiots. Just vote what you think is fair and leave it alone. The voting system levels itself out, you just f*ck it up trying to play God.WATCH THIS FILM...you'll not regret it. And if you don't like it, you shouldn't be allowed to vote because you clearly have something wrong with you and should have people controlling your internet access.But if you do like it...watch Way of the Gun afterwards, it's nearly as good in a slightly different way."
Alireza_khansari,"Jun 28, 2012",10/10,"This is a highly recommended masterpiece .an other great favorite of mine.This film was absolutely amazing.I can not forget it.I watched it Several times and I'm still hoping that Léon can get through the door and reach the bright sun light. .distinguished acting. When I see Leon I love him.i think jean reno should have been nominated for a best actor nomination. Gary Oldman is fantastic.Then there is Gary Oldman as Stansfield with one of the most memorable and iconic negative role ever played.i knew the little girl was Nataile Portman..Wow, its really a fine acting from the actress.For me is this movie the real #1 of the top 250!Léon is the best movie character I have ever seen,"
stefankrs,"Sep 13, 2021",10/10,"The professional, a beautiful tragic revenge story. Mathilda, a young girl comes home to find her family dead, a hitman takes her in and she learns to be like him in order to take revenge on the man who murdered her family. Very greatly made action movie with an amazing story with a great performance from Natalie Portman."
onepotato2,"Mar 8, 2006",N/A,"The Professional is an awful movie. Natalie Portman is precocious and godawful. The premise is absurd without knowing it is, or being entertaining. It has no internal logic. The scene in which Portman tries on outfits & performs is excruciating for anyone who is not a child molester. Films that engage adolescent girls (who spend their adolescence being as grating and needy as Portman is here) are rare in Hollywood. The equal to Portmans work here is the excruciating character of Penny in the Lost in Space remake. Gary Oldhams performance is this achieves a new height; the height of idiocy.But the movie has much, much more wrong with it; namely the eroticization of a 12 year-old girl, in the movie and in the public reaction. This is deeply disturbing. An entire cult of straight weirdo's has sprung up who talk very heatedly about Portman in this movie. They consider her a nymphet like Lolita. They brag about in the uncut European edition in which Leon (reportedly) has sex with Mathilda.Hey freaks, if you think this movie is hot, you're a sociopath.Portman has turned into a striking young woman who unfortunately dependably continues to select and make more bad movies."
misterkevinoh,"Jan 17, 2023",6/10,"While the sum of the film leaves you with little to chew on, I found Jean Reno's performance captivatingly charming, Gary Oldman hilariously over the top, and Nathalie Portman fairs just fine as far as child actors go. But outside of that it feels as though the back drop of murder and violence serves as simple action fodder. Nor does it excel in this regard, and since it's less commentary on violence and more violence as a tool for engaging the audience it lacks the depth or excitement you crave from the genre. It is also a film that did not completely know how to end. While I sympathize with writers everywhere on the difficulty of endings, it does not excuse what seems to be a complete lack of effort to tie the story up (or not tie it up, either way it should embrace a certain tone rather then... we'll nothing at all). This is by no means a bad movie, but I find myself enjoying the idea of the film over the film itself."
amirma-78982,"Sep 29, 2023",10/10,"Leon: The Professional, is directed by Luc Besson and released in 1994, is a gripping and emotionally charged crime thriller that has left an indelible mark on the world of cinema. This film, often referred to simply as ""Leon,"" is a masterclass in storytelling, character development, and intense, thought-provoking cinema.At its core, ""Leon"" is a tale of unlikely companionship between Leon (played brilliantly by Jean Reno), a taciturn and highly skilled hitman, and Mathilda (a remarkable debut performance by a young Natalie Portman), a 12-year-old girl seeking revenge after her family is brutally murdered by a corrupt DEA agent, Stansfield (a chillingly memorable Gary Oldman).What makes Leon stand out is its exploration of complex themes like innocence, loneliness, and the blurred lines between good and evil. Jean Reno's portrayal of Leon, a morally ambiguous character who lives by a strict code, is nothing short of iconic. His stoic exterior hides a deep well of vulnerability, and the gradual transformation of his relationship with Mathilda is both heartwarming and heart-wrenching.Natalie Portman's portrayal of Mathilda is nothing short of astonishing. Her portrayal of a traumatized and precocious young girl navigating a world of violence and darkness is a testament to her acting talent, even at such a young age. The chemistry between Reno and Portman is palpable, and their interactions are the emotional core of the film.Gary Oldman's performance as the unhinged and pill-popping Stansfield is a tour de force. He brings an intense and unpredictable energy to the screen, making Stansfield one of the most memorable cinematic villains of all time.Luc Besson's direction is both stylish and gritty, with expertly choreographed action sequences and a hauntingly beautiful score by Eric Serra that enhances the film's atmosphere. The film's pacing is taut, and it keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish.This film is not just a crime thriller; it's a deeply human story about connection and redemption. It challenges the audience to confront the moral ambiguity of its characters and the choices they make. This complexity, combined with outstanding performances, makes it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences around the world.The film is a cinematic masterpiece that transcends the boundaries of its genre. Its unforgettable characters, powerful performances, and exploration of profound themes make it a must-watch for anyone seeking a thought-provoking and emotionally charged cinematic experience."
mphokeedits,"Feb 6, 2017",3/10,"Two days ago I watched Leon after little more than 10 years since I last saw the movie in a theater. I had fond memories of getting goose bums last time around. But this time around the feeling was completely opposite. I couldn't even finish watching the DVD. Stopped watching just when the last fight scene was about to start... After watching movies over the years, realized Leon is just another flick made by Hollywood with all the formulas and recipes they use repeatedly to make the mass dumber and dumber. The dialogues were so awful. Both the main actors were unbearable this time around. The so-called anti hero is given a set of activities to make him look villainous... I have watched movies like Godfather, Lost in Translation a number of times. Each time I appreciate the thought process that went into making such movies. But Leon is completely out of my list of movies. Don't regret the money spend on buying the DVD, but the time wasted..."

taxirocket,"Aug 22, 2001",10/10,"this movie is fantastic. unlike most action movies, with stupid dialogue and bad acting, this movie has some of the best acting i've ever seen. the plot is good. it makes sense. it's about a hitman who takes in a 12 year old girl after her family is gunned down by DEA officers. I love Jean Reno. this is without a doubt the best acting in an english speaking role he's ever performed.Gary Oldman is simply magnificent. the best role i've ever seen him HIM play. Natalie Portman's first on screen performance is excellent. this script actually makes sense, unlike most action films. if you love to see a good action, you will love the Professional."
efs2,"Apr 8, 2010",9/10,"There is little I can add to the many things that have been said about Leon. But I will offer two observations. One is that Leon is not lascivious. Many if not most or all would-be viewers presume that it will be, and then are disappointed, or, like me, amazed that it is not. It is easy to understand the expectation. How could the story of a disturbingly attractive 12-year-old girl ""adopted"" by a single middle-aged man under bizarre circumstances - he literally holds the power of life and death over her - not be lascivious? All I can say is that the director and actors somehow found a way to avoid it. The other point, which is related to the first, is that Natalie Portman's performance is mesmerizing. She more than holds her own in her scenes with Jean Reno, and with Gary Oldman and Danny Aiello, whom I consider among the very best. That is extraordinary."
jedp2,"Dec 10, 2008",9/10,"This movie has so many levels to it any description doesn't do it justice. The juxtapositions of what assassins should be concerned with, what little girls should be protected from, what evil men do to create chaos in this world, . . . Too many well-thought out interactions between characters to do the film justice with descriptive words. If you do not experience vile anger, compassion for killers, heart-felt paternal wishes to whisk this child from adult evil or the need to cheer ruthless revenge without guilt, then you are simply not human. The depth and presentation of these characters by excellent, superb acting is only overshadowed by the writing of this masterpiece."
rumbletumblerumble,"Oct 27, 2022",9/10,"I actually saw this movie without knowing much about it. I think thats the best way to see it. Natalie portman absolutely out--acts everyone around her at age 13, there is a beautiful protagonist in leon (and his plant), and gary oldman's norman stansfield remains as one of my favorite villains to this day. The more i watch this movie, the more i notice. I have been watching it more often because it is about to leave netflix, but because this is probably my favorite movie of all time, i think its time for me to invest in my own copy. Oh and ellen greene is in this movie which is absolutely crazy to me considering i only see her as little shop's audrey. Leon the professional is always worth a watch. I think anyone would enjoy this, even the ones who hate hitman or action movies. This movie made me amazed, it made me laugh, cry, and most of all it surprised me, something hard to do for me."

Leon starts to teach Mathilda her trade.How to clean??The ending is quite surprising & i was amazed by the screenplay in this movie.It was just terrific.Great work by Luc Besson.Directing is pretty cool.This movie is underrated as many of my friends haven't heard of it.But those who have scene,they surely appreciate.The soundtrack too is fabulous adding spice to the movie.Leon said ""No Women,No Kids"".Truly this movie is for men only.But everyone who watches this will surely become a fan of Leon."

Jean Reno played a touching yet secretive hit-man brilliantly. Gary Oldman is cold and heartless and does it with ease.Plot: The plot is executed fantastically. The ending is touching, but action-packed and is thankfully not the least bit soapy or sappy.A fantastic film that graces the screen with elegance and poise, and does not disappoint action fans. 'Leon: The Professional' is truly a film for almost anyone. 'The Professional' is very professional indeed."
