Smells_Like_Cheese,"Nov 1, 2004",10/10,"Man, I can not get this film out of my head. It is so rare that a movie can affect me the way ""The Pianst"" did. The last movie that did that was ""Casino"". I was really tired when I was watching the movie. It was almost midnight, so I was thinking that I'll start watching and I'll finish it in the morning. Did I? No, indeed I did not stop watching. I couldn't stop it. I just wanted to see what would happen next. I cried during ""Schindler's List"", I sobbed in this film. Everything that happens in this film is so sad. Adrien Brody does a remarkable job of acting in this film. I would very highly recommend this film. Especially if you are a history buff. Please, I think this film should be in the top 10 best films of all time.I looked on the message boards you know and some other user comments that didn't enjoy this film much, they criticized Adrien Brody's performance and say that he was boring and only showed emotions that are easy to act. Please, you have got to be kidding me. This man portrayed the total feeling of hopelessness, being alone, being hated. I one time had an audition in high school like this to see if I could improvise, and the way I imagined this feeling is like in dodgeball where you have no one else on your team and you're the only one left standing, yet on the other team there is 20 big men that are just waiting to wack that ball at you. Adrien couldn't have done a better job, I was so frightened for him and cried for him during the whole film while he was one the run.Roman Polanski as the director, he himself escaped the terrors of being a prisoner in The Holocaust, yet he lost his mother and other family members. Yes, I'm sure this film must have been hard to re create for him, but he was probably the only director that could have done this movie as brilliantly as he did. He created this story and made it so effective, I called up my mom and told her that I loved her so much because we take so many things for granted. True, this isn't the 1930's or 40's, and we are in America. But it's still frightening to think that human beings are capable of that much hate and being so brutal to another human.World War II is one of the most frightening wars in history, if you read more about The Holocaust, you get more into it and you should. If you are not interested, then watch this film. It's a must see, otherwise how else will we learn from our mistakes? The Pianist is a beautiful and extremely dark tale about a man and the struggle to survive. The ending is so powerful and moving to know that sometimes one man can make a difference in a crowd of so many and I'm not talking about Adrien Brody's character. You'll see what I mean.10/10"
Fella_shibby,"Sep 9, 2013",10/10,"This is a truly heart-wrenching story of one man whose family gets perished in the Holocaust and about his survival over solitude, deprivation, starvation and terror while in hiding during the Nazi occupation. In my opinion it is one of the finest depictions of the holocaust. This movie came close to Schindlers list in depicting the horrors of Holocaust. Brody puts in a marvelous and utterly touching performance. The story depicts the emotional and cultural breakdown of persecuted Jewish community as Nazi policy tightens around them. Excellent acting by Brody."
Xanan,"Jan 20, 2003",10/10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."
baumer,"Mar 27, 2003",N/A,"I can remember when this film came out I was adamantly against seeing it. I had my preconceived notions that it would be some other heroic Jewish Holocaust film where good triumphs over evil and in between we would see some brutal atrocities committed by the Germans to add some flavour.How wrong I was.This is one of the best films I have ever seen and what it did to me I cannot describe in words. But in a nutshell, it moved me, made me cry, made me feel like I was in the Polish ghetto in 1940, and ultimately made me kiss the sidewalks as I walked out of the theater and thanked God that I live in the free society that I do.Roman Polanski has proved that he is a great director with films like Chinatown and Rosemary's Baby but this is his crowning achievement. I think the fact that this won the awards that it did at this years Oscars goes a long way to validate the brilliance of this film. I believe that the Oscar's are rigged for the most part and films and actresses and such win based more on their pedigree or business associations than anything else, so when it won best actor and director and adapted screenplay this year, it tells you that it should have won best picture but the Weinsteins seem to have a spell over everyone, hence a charlatan like Chicago takes top prize. Sorry for the digression here but when you compare a ""film"" like Chicago to a masterpiece like The Pianist, there really is one clear cut winner. They handed out the statue to the wrong movie.The Pianist follows up and coming piano player Wlad Spielzman from his days as a local hero to a prisoner of war to his time in the ghettos, surviving only by the kindness of strangers. I think many people have touched on this before but what makes this film so amazing and well crafted is because Spielzman is a man that we can all relate to. He is not a hero, he is not a rebel and he is not a kamikaze type that wants and lusts after revenge. He is a simple man that is doing everything in his power to stay alive. He is a desperate man and fears for his life and wants to stay as low as he can. Only from the succor he receives from others does he manage to live and breathe and eat and hide. And this is how I related to him. If put in his position, how would I react? Exactly the way he did. This is a man that had everything taken from him. His livelihood, his family, his freedom and almost his life. There is no time for heroics here. Adrien Brody embodies the spirit of Spielzman and his win at this years Oscars was one of the happiest moments I have had watching the festivities. His speech was even better but that is a topic for another time.Ultimately it is his gift of music that perhaps saves his life and the final scene that he has with the German soldier is one of the most emotionally galvanizing scenes I've witnessed. With very little dialogue, it is in the eyes, the face, the mouth and the sounds that chime throughout their tiny space that tell you all you need to know. I think it is this scene that won Brody his Oscar. This is one of the all time great performances.I think Polanski spoke from the heart here. He has taken a palette of memories and amalgamated them with what he has read and given us one of the best films of our generation and any other. I think The Pianist will go down as one of the best films of this century and when all is said and done, Chicago will be forgotten the way Ordinary People was forgotten and when people talk about the film The Pianist, they will do so with reverence and respect. This is a cinematic masterpiece.10 out of 10"
FilmOtaku,"Apr 28, 2003",8/10,"The Pianist is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, at the time Poland's most acclaimed pianist whose life is transformed during the Nazi occupation of Warsaw beginning in 1939.  The film spans several years and maps his many personal trials in addition to providing the perspectives of his family, rebel factions and sympathizers.Brilliantly directed by Roman Polanski and starring an amazing Adrien Brody, The Pianist is bound to garner comparisons to Schindler's List, for obvious reasons.  However similar the subject matter, the approach is different. While Schindler's List was filmed in a beautiful, crisp black and white that offered many incredible images, The Pianist was filmed with almost muted color.  Schindler's List featured what has been argued as a complicated hero.  Oskar Schindler did save many Jews, but not without battling his own materialistic demons first.  The Pianist's Szpilman is a sympathetic character throughout.  His plight was desperate, and the demons he fought were over his own guilt in surviving a fight that eventually turns into a primal will to live.Polanski does not spare the viewer any grief with his film.  The horrific scenes between the Nazis and the Warsaw Jews were more terrifying and horrible than any horror/suspense movie I have seen in some time, possibly ever.  The humiliation and complete loss is wrenching.  In several scenes, Jews are lined up in the middle of the night and subjected to either torture or death.  In one case, a woman asks of a Nazi officer, ""What will happen to us?"" and is promptly shot point blank in the head.  The camera does not flinch or subdue any of these atrocities.A mention must be made of Brody's performance.  Having only previously seen Brody in two other films, Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" and Terrence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line"" (a part that was supposed to be his launch into stardom before his part was unfortunately cut drastically) I knew his potential was great.  After his Oscar win, I viewed this movie with more criticism than I normally would have and he certainly did not disappoint.  He transcended my expectations.  His physical transformation was amazing, but more importantly, he conveyed the sorrow of this man shockingly well - in both verbal and non-verbal contexts.  It will be very interesting to see what kind of opportunities this role will afford him, and the kinds of roles he will accept.Something worth mentioning is the affect this movie had on the audience with whom I viewed this film.  Normally, when a film ends, the regular hardcore filmsters like myself will stay and watch the credits in their entirety. The rest of the audience stands up and leaves, usually to the chagrin of the remaining enthusiasts.  This was one of the few times I have seen a film at a theater where not one person stood to leave during the final credits. It wasn't until the house lights came up at the end did people begin to disperse.  Personally, I hightailed it out of the theater the second the lights came on because not only was my face a mess from crying during the film (Tammy Faye comes to mind) but I had this overwhelming need for an emotional release, so when I reached my car I sat and wept for about five minutes.  It has been years since I have watched a film that upset me to that extent. Conversely, while discussing this film with my brother, (someone who loves movies as much and has similar tastes as I do) he mentioned that while he thought the movie was excellent, he wasn't as profoundly emotionally effected as I was.  After thinking about this for a couple of days, I realized the difference: The music.  As a classical music enthusiast and erstwhile musician, the thought of not being able to enjoy, much less play the music you love is a tragic one.  Then the emotional outpouring that comes when you return to it - there aren't words to describe how intense that is.  Not having the same appreciation for this musical genre, one will be able to sympathize with the physical and emotional tribulations, but perhaps not in the musical sense.The Pianist was truly an astonishing film.  I was riveted from start to finish and so emotionally affected that I couldn't even consider writing a review until a week later.  Having said that, I am filing this away with my list of movies which include Schindlers List and Philadelphia, as films that I love but cannot rewatch for a long time after due to their intensely emotional content.--Shelly"
dtb,"Jan 9, 2004",10/10,"This wrenching yet ultimately uplifting fact-based drama won Adrien Brody his Academy Award and finally made him a star (along with his gracious yet heartfelt Oscar speech and That Kiss :-) -- rightly so, since title character Wladyslaw Szpilman is a challenging role in so many ways!  It's not easy to command the screen when your character often has to be passive, deliberately trying not to draw attention to himself to keep from falling into Nazi hands in war-torn Poland, but Brody pulls it off.  It helps that Brody is absolutely stellar at acting with his eyes, plus his body language speaks volumes; these fill in the emotional cracks, especially in scenes where Szpilman, alone and in hiding, can't speak or even move around much for fear of giving himself away.  (Brody is the youngest actor to date to win the Best Actor Oscar, BTW, having gotten his little gold man only a month before his 30th birthday.) While there's no lack of haunting scenes, thanks to the deservedly Oscar-winning work of director Roman Polanski and screenwriter Ronald Harwood, the one that always gets me is the one where Szpilman discovers the apartment serving as his latest `safe house' has a piano. We see Szpilman sit at the piano; we see him in a head-and-shoulders shot, shoulders moving; we hear piano music and gasp as we fear his love and longing for music is about to give him away -- and then we see his hands moving in the air just above the keyboard and realize, with both relief and a pang of regret, that the music is only in Szpilman's head.  Terrific as the other 2002 Best Actor nominees were, now that I've seen THE PIANIST (as well as the fascinating making-of documentary on the DVD's flip side, showing what a physically and emotionally grueling experience Brody's job often was), I'd be really p***ed off if anybody but Adrien Brody had won! (Besides, the rest of the 2002 Best Actor nominees already won Oscars -- this time it was dark horse Brody's turn! :-)"
jotix100,"Jan 21, 2003",10/10,"The Pianist is an incredible film in many aspects. Roman Polanski's account of the survival of the pianist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, is a document about how one man can overcome the worst possible situations in a world gone completely mad around him.The only fault one can find with the adaptation of Mr. Szpilman's story by playwright Ronald Harwood, is the fact that we never get to know the real Wladyslaw Szpilman, the man, as some of the comments made to this forum also have indicated.There is a very interesting point raised by the the pianist's father who upon reading something in the paper, comments about how the Americans have forgotten them. Well, not only the Americans, but the rest of the world would not raise a finger to do anything for the people that were being imprisoned and made to live in the confined area of Warsaw. The exterminating camps will come later.What is amazing in the film, is the frankness in which director Polanski portrays the duplicity of some Jews in the ghetto. The fact that Jews were used to control other Jews is mind boggling, but it was a fact, and it's treated here matter of factly. Had this been made by an American director, this aspect would have never surfaced at all. Yet, Mr. Polanski and Mr. Harewood show us that all was not as noble and dignified as some other films have treated this ugly side of war.Wladyslaw Szpilman, as played by Adrien Brody, is puzzling sometimes, in that we never get to know what's in his mind. He's a man intent in not dying, but he's not a fighter. He accepts the kindness extended to him. He never offers to do anything other than keep on hiding, which is a human instinct. He will never fight side by side with the real heroes of the ghetto uprising. His role is simply to witness the battle from his vantage point in one of the safe houses across the street from where the action takes place.Adrien Brody is an interesting actor to watch. As the pianist of the story he exudes intelligence. There is a scene where Szpilman, in one of the safe houses he is taken, discovers an upright piano. One can see the music in his head and he can't contain himself in moving his fingers outside the closed instrument playing the glorious music from which he can only imagine what it will sound in his mind.The supporting cast is excellent. Frank Findlay, a magnificent English actor is the father of the pianist and Maureen Lipman, another veteran of the stage, plays the mother with refined dignity.In watching this film one can only shudder at the thought of another conflict that is currently brewing in front of our eyes. We wonder if the leaders of the different factions could be made to sit through a showing of The Pianist to make them realize that war is hell."
ashcoounter,"Feb 1, 2003",9/10,"Polanski has depicted the gory details of the holocaust without much restraint. But, the most wonderful aspect of the film is that the director has not lost focus of his story and instead of focusing too much on the holocaust horror he has weaved the true-life narrative of survival around devillish happenings.Every single act of escapade Szpilman goes through is depicted like a drop of water on a barren desert. However, the Oasis in the driest desert comes in the end and it is here that Polanski captures the essence of human emotion. I had this very strong urge of jumping into the theater screen and magically adopting a character in the movie and doing something about the helplesness portrayed so convincingly.Overall, Polanski has given a stunning visual narrative of the cold war. Survival indeed is a privilege though it is taken for granted today. Performances by Brody, Kretschmann deserve applause.Pawel Edelman's camera work is moving and he has brilliantly captured the dark sadness in the visual canvas in an effective way. The lighting is amazing. Pre-dawn shooting schedule could have helped a great deal.Hervé de Luze's editing work has ensured that the narrative does not slip away from focus. Most notable is the scene where the human bodies are lit on fire and the camera raises to show the smoke. The darkness of the smoke is enhanced and is used effectively to fade the scene out.The scene where Brody's fingers move as he rests his hands on the bars of the tram handle only goes to show the brilliance of Polanski as a film-maker.Great film that will be in the running for this year's Oscars. I will give it a 9 Out of 10."
Quinoa1984,"Jan 16, 2003",10/10,"The Pianist tells the story of such a man in war time Poland, played by Adrien Brody, who from start to finish sees his life literally getting worse and worse and worse- starts off with new rules from the Nazis, then the stars on the arms, followed by the Warsaw ghetto, and while there he could play in the restaurant, that too soon ended, as the trains arrived and took his family and anyone else he knew away.  During this he narrowly escapes, and from then on the film in a sense almost becomes not exactly a holocaust film, but more like a cross of that as the element and the basic structure of something a-la in Cast Away: this includes stretches of scenes showing Brody simply trying to keep out of view of the Germans, either in a small apartment provided by helpful Polish Christians/Jewish resistance, or as a scavenger in the abandoned sections of the ghetto, all while feeling the old rhythm of the piano in his head and fingertips.This is the kind of magnificent filmmaking that shows a director not only being as true to the story given to him (that of Painist Szpilman, based on his autobiography) but to his past as well- Roman Polanksi faced similar conditions as a boy in the early 40's, and has found the best line to show, never crossed or mis-stepped, in representing the characters and the period. There aren't any hints of tightened suspense, no clues as to where the film could veer to, it just is.  The big difference to be seen between a film like this and Schindler's List is not just in the people and situations (Schindler's List was a film about two people, Schindler and Goeth, in the foreground while the Pianist is a total first person tale), yet also in the filmmaking qualities being here surely European.  And while the accents on the Polish-Jewish actors sounds a bit too British, that is quite forgivable considering the scope of the project (thank heavens he didn't put in English speaking Germans).In conclusion, Brody turns in a superb performance, and this indeed is in with Polanski's best, a deserved of 2002's Palme D'Or.  Great music too. A+"
baba44713,"Apr 7, 2005",9/10,"I remember seeing ""Schindler's list"" about ten years ago, and I remember how weird I felt for being almost completely unmoved by it. Although it showed the horrors of holocaust quite realistically, somehow it all seemed just a bit too fake and exaggerated. Characters were a bit off (I still can't decide who was more over the top, Schindler or Goeth), fake sentimentalism was all over the place, . While it was a work of art and an important reminder of true events that shouldn't be forgotten, on emotional level it just somehow failed to deliver.Enter ""The Pianist"". With no Spielberg around to put his trademark sappy material, we finally have a movie that shows the true horror and tragedy of Jewish people in World War II. The story is told through the eyes of one man - Wladislaw Szpielman, Jewish pianist who works in a radio station in Warsaw during the German occupation of Poland. Together with him we watch his world getting torn apart, witness his family being taken away, his existence being reduced to bare essentials. Brody gives a subtle yet spectacular performance, his best work yet. And never once are we reminded that we are watching a movie. Everything is shown from Szpielman's point of view, and it is all very gritty and realistic. While Spielberg's rendition of German atrocities always had a slightly staged feel to augment their dramatic purpose, here they are so true to life there impact is much greater - you watch and are being reminded in horror that this things actually happened.While being very hard to watch sometimes, this is a movie that ""Schindler's List"" was supposed to be. This movie doesn't judge anybody, or tries to explain anything - it shows historical events as a reflection of one man's fate, making a powerful testimony that stays with you long after the beautiful last shot and the end credits are over."
9902439Claessens,"Oct 1, 2002",10/10,"last weekend, I saw Roman Polanski's The Pianist and what a movie. The grizzly reality feeling of the movie shell-shocked me in the first place but later on I recognized the pure feeling of the film: The horror what war does with innocent people truly is. the main story isn't about a war hero, but about people who don't want to die in this madness. Every aspect of the film is really done for an reason and in his place and you don't feel this as entertainment.the music is what hit me the most. the classical tunes had such an enormous impact on me and portrayed the feelings of the main role of the pianist. The fact that there are no hero's in a war movie is for me more than a welcome benefit. No war in the world should have hero's who can't die. Everybody in this movie can die, every second of it. The scary moments are real scary.bottom line: ten times as realistic as the also brilliant Schindler's list. and twenty times better than Saving private Ryan for the lack of hero's and there is no patriotism at all.ten out of ten, best movie of 2002"
Shilo_R_A,"Mar 18, 2023",6/10,"The Pianist must be one of the most acclaimed and well-known depictions of the Holocaust in cinema, ever. Directed by Roman Polanski, it follows the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman - a Jewish pianist in Warsaw, Poland, just as the Nazi occupation begins there. It depicts the worsening state of him and his family through the Holocaust, and his struggle to survive throughout it.I can appreciate the sentiment of the film, showing how even well-known artists and people with status were stripped by the Nazi regime of their human rights, how things slowly escalated until even the artists couldn't think of art outside of dreams, maybe. How it all came down to surviving, and even the luckiest people that somehow managed to survived were deeply scarred by the horrible things they've seen. I'd say that Brody gives a very solid performance, and the film does manage to accomplish what it tries to do, in a way. The problem is, well, that it doesn't do much beyond that.There were scenes with shock value, sure, and thinking that everything we saw in the film is pretty close to how things went down can make one shiver all right. But the plot, especially in the second half of the film, didn't have much meat at all. The film crawled its way forward, the saturation goes down with each scene, but never did anything special to compensate for the slow, slow pacing and lack of interest I had in the main plot. The cinematography is okay, the dialogue is okay, the performances are okay. The moments that moved me were mostly that - moments - and mostly on the first half of the film. For a 2.5-hour film, it could've done more. Especially considering how widely acclaimed it is.So, if I had to sum it up, I'd say that I do appreciate certain things in the movie - the way it depicts the fall, the terror and the utter shock that Jewish artists have felt as they were torn apart from their seemingly-safe world, for instance. The shock value is definitely there in certain scenes, but the overall experience was pretty slow and lacking. I wasn't immersed, and I think that the film ends up feeling just...well, not bad, but not really good either. The first half is pretty good; the second half is mostly meh. I'm feeling something like a 6.3/10. Really wanted to like this more, but I guess it wasn't meant to be."
orangeisthenewawesome,"Feb 21, 2011",10/10,"My husband and I decided to watch this on netflix one night as we had heard it was good. Neither of us had any expectations and figured if it won a couple of Oscars it must be decent. I had no idea it was an absolute masterpiece.This may be one of the best movies I have seen to date. Days after I saw this movie I cannot stop visualizing the images and feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. The cinematography is breathtaking. The beauty of pre-devastation Warsaw is sharply contrasted with the bleakness of the ghetto, and it would be understatement to say how haunting the visuals of Warsaw after the bombings were.The acting here is tremendous. Brody (who I had really not seen in anything else significant prior to this) carries the entire movie on his wan shoulders. He conveys so much with pain, anguish, hope, and loss with just his eyes. It is quite the actor who causes the viewer to feel the pain he is experiencing as a character. This was an extremely well deserved acting Oscar.This movie is extremely depressing considering the subject matter but it is told and portrayed with grace and power by Polanski. So many scenes are powerful and haunting. To me, in many ways this is a perfect movie. Yes, I know this review is filled with hyperbole, but I simply cannot remember the last time I was so moved and impressed by a film as I was with the Pianist. See it at least once."
Close_The_Door,"Jan 25, 2006",9/10,"I knew Roman Polanski's talent but was not prepared to this descent to Hell, described in painstaking detail. I'm physically upset after watching this film. The sense of disgust is real. How awful. How awful.I could not help identifying myself with the Jewish Poles in Varsovia. I couldn't help thinking that the paralytic old man thrown down the window could be my grandfather. Couldn't help thinking that the kid savagely pulled through the wall could be my brother. Couldn't help thinking that the girl asking the SS-guard the wrong question and being killed just for that, could be myself.The film describes beastly destruction of any dignity, and yet the struggle for surviving despite everything, even if rationally you realise that, perhaps, it would be even better to end it all at once. It describes the dishonesty of people profiting of this situation to make business out of your misery. It describes your need of believing the words of men NOT of their word, if they promise you life. And affection and courage surviving despite all this.This film could make a good pair with ""der Untergang"" with Bruno Ganz, which is also such a masterpiece that you may risk feeling sympathetic with the Nazi. Have you had this temptation? Watch ""The Pianist""."
csab-39797,"Feb 13, 2019",10/10,"Everything about this movie is made in perfect detail; the clothes, the buildings etc. The audience gets to see how the Jewish population in Warsaw started out as normal everyday citizens and how the German government slowly brought them to their deaths.
The acting is not over the top it's completely realistic and Adrien Brody is MAGNIFICANT! If you don't shed a tear or get chills watching this true story then you have no soul!"
johnharapa,"Oct 23, 2021",10/10,"Some reviews I've read here, have found this movie too detached, lacking urgency. I believe, that impassive quality reflects exactly what Polanski wants to say this extraordinary jewel.By showing Wladyslaw Szpilman as a survivor but not a fighter or a hero--as a man who does all he can to save himself, but would have died without enormous good luck and some kindness from a few non-Jews--Polanski is reflecting, I believe, his own deepest feelings: that he survived, but need not have, and that his mother died and left a wound that had never properly healed.Adrian Brody's performance was utterly mesmerising. I doubt that we'll see him act like that - EVER.Little wonder he was awarded Best Male Actor at the Oscars.Polanski too was awarded Best Director - ironic Brody was the youngest recipient of an Oscar and Polanski was the oldest until Clint Eastwood won it several years later."
and_mikkelsen,"Aug 21, 2023",9/10,"This movie was incredible, despite the fact that I feel completely emotionally drained! By the end i wanted to cry but I just couldn't cause ive used up all my emotions through out the movie!!The movie follows Wladek spilzman, a jewish pianist, who struggled to survive a German occupied Warzaw! The movie begins in 1939 and ends some time after 1945, which means we get to experience some of the significant events that took place in Warzaw doing WW2!The movie throws a lot og haunting imagery at you, moments that are impossible to erase from your memory ever again! Its brutal and it does not shy away from the dark stuff, giving an authentic experience!It is a movie i can highly recommrnd even if it is too dark and depressing to come back too!"
KineticSeoul,"Feb 16, 2011",7/10,"This is a well crafted movie that deserves some praise, but I still felt the film is a bit overrated. I guess it's cause I was expecting a phenomenal and amazing movie, but what I got was a pretty good movie. It just wasn't as powerful or compelling as I thought it would be. Adrien Brody was almost perfect for this role, his transition from being a prideful musician to a broken down man was done really well. This film just wasn't all that challenging, the plot is basically based on a true story of Władysław Szpilman(Adrien Brody). And his struggle to survive during the Holocaust. The thing is the whole thing seems a bit conventional a lot of aspect of this movie just seemed to narrow at times and straightforward which isn't necessarily a good thing and lack depth. The film also seemed to drag a bit because of the direction it kept going, it's a good movie and I agree with some of the positive feedback this film has been getting. It just isn't a powerful or amazing film I was looking forward to seeing, not one of those movies I feel I need to see again someday after it's finished. It really isn't a masterpiece like come critics claim it to be.7.8/10"
Buddy-51,"Jun 14, 2003",N/A,"`The Pianist' is a bit like `Schindler's List' as seen from the inside out.  The one flaw in that earlier film always seemed to be that, by choosing to make a Gentile  Oskar Schindler - the protagonist in his film, Spielberg turned the Jews themselves almost into background players in their own story.  That doesn't happen with `The Pianist' since the hero in this case happens to be himself a Jew  the real life Polish pianist and composer Wladyslaw Szpilman - who managed, through strength, determination and the assistance of a number of brave and caring individuals, to survive the horrors of that darkest and most inexplicable chapter in 20th Century history.This is not to say that `The Pianist' is a better film than `Schindler's List'  far from it.  For while this latest work from Roman Polanski is a fascinating tale of survival in its own right, the film lacks the moral and psychological resonance that made Spielberg's work such a universally acclaimed masterpiece.  Because Schindler was an outsider looking in, he was forced to make the kind of moral choices that Szpilman never really faces in the situations in which he finds himself.  In fact, the one time that the protagonist is confronted with such an option  having to decide whether or not to betray his people by joining the Jewish police whose job it is maintain order in the Warsaw ghetto  Szpilman flat out declines the offer. This may, indeed, be the way circumstances played themselves out in real life, but this elimination of any kind of psychological depth makes `The Pianist' seem frustratingly superficial at times.Although the film isn't as rich and powerful as it might have been, `The Pianist' is still exceptional on a lot of different levels.  First of all, Polanski and his screenwriter, Ronald Hardwood, both of whom won Oscars for their work here, capture the brutality and sadism of the Nazi regime with frightening candor and almost `reportorial' objectivity.  As in `Schindler's List,' people in this film die in very believable, very graphic ways. Particularly interesting are the early sections of the film in which we witness the gradual steps leading up to the eventual deportation and extermination of the Warsaw Jews, beginning with the curtailment of Jewish civil rights, then to the branding of them with stars of David on their clothing, then to their imprisonment in the Warsaw ghetto, and, finally, to the inexorable walk to the gas chamber.  `The Pianist' doesn't take us that far on screen, but we sure sense the presence of those death camps in the loss of Szpilman's entire family.  `The Pianist' brilliantly recreates this shameful era in recent human history and does so without becoming sentimental and pretentious in the process.Adrian Brody won the Best Actor Oscar for his performance here, and he is very good indeed, especially given the fact that the role calls for him to be more of a reactor to the events around him than a catalyst.  Polanski and Hardwood have provided this fine young actor with a veritable tour de force assignment that he executes with a great deal of skill and aplomb. Unfortunately, a number of the other characters - particularly those who go out of their way to help him - remain stubbornly enigmatic throughout.`The Pianist' is an honorable addition to the list of fine films that have attempted to come to grips with the subject of the holocaust.  But, for my money, the best still remains `The Shop on Main Street,' the Oscar-winning Best Foreign Language film of 1965.  This superb Czech film does what `The Pianist' is never quite able to do, which is to find a way to involve us in the momentous moral dilemmas that undoubtedly faced many of the people involved in this life-and-death event.  `The Pianist,' by making its tale strictly a story of survival and not a study of human psychology, fails to illuminate much of what we really need to know about that time. And about ourselves."
ftm68_99,"Feb 27, 2003",1/10,"If you think that movies that deal with Nazi atrocities are inherently worthwhile, then you might think that this movie is inherently worthwhile. If, on the other hand, you expect a movie, whether it deals with Nazi atrocities or not, to actually tell a story, then I'd say there's a good chance you *won't* find this movie worthwhile.What does this movie give us? Well, it gives us a string of Nazi atrocities, very realistically depicted, and it gives us what I suppose is supposed to be a main character, but it gives us precious little else!  Most of main character's screen time is given over to him being acted upon by circumstances and by other people, but very little of him being pro-active, himself.  And even his passivity might be interesting if we knew what he was thinking or feeling.  But we are never given that information.  We never know what it is that he really wants.  Or how he feels, say, about the fact that his family was shipped off to their probable death, but he was saved by a fluke.The picture is certainly well-made from the stand point of art direction and cinematography, but story-wise, it's a shambles.  As far as I'm concerned, Roman Polanski owes me big-time.  Thank you."
Hitchcoc,"Sep 10, 2009",10/10,"There have been so many fine films that deal with the Holocaust. Each shows the atrocities of the Germans, their random cruelty, their ruthlessness. This film has all that, but it also has Adrien Brody. This is a film that gets us inside the human being, the person who must run, whose iron will propels him forward. The thing is, though, he is not necessarily a hero in the traditional sense. We sense the fatigue of his character as he runs from situation to situation, just trying to stay alive. There are good people around him, many are good Germans. While we watch people shot in the head, beaten to the ground, mutilated, we see him moving aimlessly toward something (the thing is we don't know what that something is). He hears rumors about the Russians liberating Poland but he can't let up for a second. He watches as the underground makes sacrifice after sacrifice, their building burned, their people sent up in flames. He sees himself as a coward. He thinks about being dead, but his will to live drives him on. The title, of course, is him--the pianist--a nationally known classical pianist, suddenly dehumanized. We see his weaknesses and his strengths. We also get a more balanced though terrifying view of the situation in the Polish ghetto. This is a film we should all see."
janicenichols-32565,"Sep 28, 2018",10/10,"Ok - so some might disagree and suggest Schindler's List is the best WW2 film but for me it was the Pianist - such a raw and painful representation of Nazi brutality and desperation of the people. This film isn't for everyone, but you know that going into it. You won't feel good afterwards, but that's a reminder you're human. Definitely worth a watch."
zetes,"Jul 6, 2003",8/10,"The Pianist is far from Roman Polanski's best film or his `most personal work,' as the back of the DVD case says. In fact, it's easily the least personal film I've seen from him; any director who has enough clout to secure the funding for the production could have made this film and had it turn out just as well. As a director, it is a small achievement. Likewise, the screenplay writes itself; in fact, it did write itself, as it's based on a true story. I must admit I have a bias against films dealing with WWII and especially the Jewish experience in Europe. Affecting the audience is as simple as snapping one's fingers. Or, more specifically, executing a Jew. Whenever the audience starts to get a little comfortable, all the filmmaker has to do is have a Nazi shoot a Jew in the head. It's all too easy. Any film with that subject matter is automatically deemed important in the minds of critics and audiences, which makes it difficult for anyone to propose any criticism against it. Truth be told, The Pianist is a very good film. It's well done, and, while I don't think it's Polanski's best work, he does a good job. But it's too easy, I think, to overpraise something like this. It was very entertaining that this movie caused so many upsets at the Oscars, but, after seeing the film, it doesn't surprise me. This is the kind of movie that impresses the Academy most, because it's easy. The three awards it won were not deserved, at least in my opinion. If I weren't so familiar with the Academy and their thought processes, it would really shock me that Polanski beat Scorsese, who made an original picture with verve and passion, and that Brody (I haven't mentioned him, and he is good) beat Daniel Day-Lewis, who, as I've just said above, creates a character that will live forever. As for the screenplay, Ronald Harwood (and/or Polanski) could have made the film much more than just one of ten thousand tales of survival. There are a lot of moments when more substance could have been found. I like how Szpilman has to constantly watch the action while locked up in a room, yearning to be able to do something about it, but always relegated to the spectator's role. They do do well when they introduce the character of the Nazi soldier trying to make good by helping Szpilman, but they don't do very much. Of course, I think part of the point is that this man appeared and disappeared without much pomp or circumstance. In fact, it would have been more powerful if they had never revealed that Szpilman discovered who this man was. Of course, that might have been disrespectful.I have now seen all five Best Picture nominees from last year, and I would rank them as follows: 1) The Hours; 2) Gangs of New York; 3) The Pianist; 4) Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers; 5) Chicago. That I rank the actual winner last shouldn't raise eyebrows, because, to tell you the truth, I don't rank The Pianist and The Two Towers that much higher. The first two were original, intelligent, and challenging. The last three were much simpler, and it's no big surprise that they are more beloved. 8/10."
ma-cortes,"Nov 18, 2008",8/10,"This is an emotional tale and very decent drama about a pianist named Szpilman from a luxurious life until terrible ending in the Warsaw ghetto and other events. Polanski directs perfectly a brooding portrait about the holocaust with his personal knowledge and own experience on his tumultuous childhood . Adrien Brody is excellent in a complicate and suffering role. Besides, other splendid actors, such as Frank Finlay, Jessica Meyer, Emilia Fox and Thomas Kretschman as a good Nazi officer who helps him. It contains evocative and adequate cinematography by cameraman Pawel Edlman, Polanski's regular. Musical score by Wojciech Kilar with brilliant piano sounds. Academy Award for best director Roman Polanski, Actor: Adrien Brody and adapted script by Ronald Harwood based on Wladyslaw Szpilman memories.Adding more details over largely described on the movie referred 'the Warsaw ghetto uprising', the events happened on the following way: In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, Reinhard Heydrich chief of Gestapo began to place all Polish Jews in ghettos, where they could slowly die of hunger and disease. The campaign was to be administered by the Waffen-SS the party's military formations that fought as integral units in the armed forces. The Warsaw ghetto was the largest of these segregated areas established by the Nazis in Poland. In 1940 Heydrich, using the excuse that the spread of typhus had to be contained, set up a special section 11 miles in circumference enclosed by a brick wall 10 feet high. The cost was paid by the Judenrat, the Jewish Council of twenty-four-members, which was in charge of Jewish affairs inside the ghetto. In 1940 more than 80.000 gentile Poles living in the infected area were ordered to leave, and the next month about 140,000 living elsewhere in the city were moved in which the 240,000 still live in the ghetto. Some 360.000 Jews, a third of Warsaw's population, were herded into a 3,5-square-mile area. Meanwhile, Gestapo agents removed all Jews from the economic and cultural life of the city, from factories,shops, theaters, and libraries. On November 15,1940, the ghetto was sealed and its twenty-two entrances closed. No one was allowed to leave or enter, there was to be contact with the outside world. The situation soon became critical,Jews fought for jobs in the ghetto, including work with the labor battalions organized by the Nazis. Those unable to find work tried to exist by selling jewels,clothing, or anything else to obtain food. From 300 to 400 died daily in the Warsaw trap. More than 43.000 starved to death during the first year. Children crazed by hunger crawled through the sewers to the non-Jewish sectors of the city to smuggle in a bit of food. People were no longer moved by the sight of men and women falling dead on the streets. The Nazi authorities began intensified measure on July 22, 1942. As a memorial to Heydrich, Heirich Himmler ordered all Jews except those already in concentration camps to be deported .The ghetto and all labor camps would then be destroyed. Mass deportations to the gas chambers of Treblinka began. In two months 300.000 Jews were eliminated. The Judenrat was ordered to deliver 6.000 Jews daily for deportation. Each day thousands were driven by guards through the gates. Young Zionists, pioneers training to go to Palestine, mobilized first to be followed by members of the Polish workers party . On July 28, 1942, the Jewish Combat organization consisting about 1.000 men and boys was formed. All resolved to kill as many of their tormentors as they could before they died. The Jews fighting from rooftops, cellars, and attics,Poles outside the ghetto now began to send in more revolvers, grenades, and dynamite. In 1943 the guerrillas divided into twenty-two groups built an intricate network underground cellars and tunnels ,linked with command posts . In April 19,1943 German troops moved in on the ghetto to send all who were left to Treblinka in a final action. First came the armed trucks, tanks, and armored cars. The ghetto fighters poured a hail of bullets, grenades and bombs, the fighting went on for twenty-eight days. The guerrillas fought to the last. Many committed suicide at the moment before capture. The Germans dragged survivors from the cellars and rubble. Fewer than 100 escaped, the last 60000 Jews had been exterminated or killed in the explosions and fires. Polish sources reported that the fighters had killed 300 Germans and wounded 1000. From Warsaw Jewish resistance moved to swamps and forests."
dbdumonteil,"Dec 29, 2005",10/10,"In March 2003, Roman Polanski's ""the Pianist"" (2002) pocketed three Oscars including best actor (Adrien Brody) and best director (Roman Polanski). One month earlier, the ceremony of the French Oscars showered the movie with praise by attributing to it and his author similar prizes. Earlier in May 2002, the festival of Cannes crowned it of the most prestigious prize: the deservedly Golden Palm. Already in 2002 and chiefly throughout 2003, awards rained on Polanski's deeply moving piece of work and rightly so. It is a true return to form for him after an uneven career which started after the spooky ""the Tenant"" (1976) and wildly oscillated between duds (Pirates, 1986, Frantic, 1988) and palatable but not peerless works (Death and the Maiden, 1994, the Ninth Gate, 1999). ""The Pianist"" helped to rekindle the flame that made such treasures, hallmarks in their own domains (the wonderful ""Rosemary's Baby"", 1968 in the fantastic or the fabulous ""Chinatown"", 1974 in the film noir) and could be a stalwart success in the movie with the Second World War as the backdrop. It is perhaps Polanski's most personal film to date and the one he has always wanted to shot, surely to exorcise traumatic memories haunting him since his childhood. Like his main protagonist, Wladyslaw Szpilman, he experienced the horror of the ghetto of Warsaw.To get his demons out of his head, he preferred to adapt for the screen Spilzman's memories, a genius pianist and a man who bit by bit lost his family and friends on whom he could rely, a man who was deprived of his piano and thus of his ""raison d'être"". As Stefan Zweig says: ""to read is to live"", well for him ""to play is to live"". Even when he has the opportunity to play, he has to refrain himself. See the scene in which he has settled down to his flat. Before leaving him, the owner says to him: ""please, don't make noise"". Polanski makes us share his craving for playing by putting his main protagonist in front of the sacred instrument ans plays us the music in Spilzman's head without the latter touches the keys. He was also a man who saw sorrow, pain and the unthinkable (the sequences in which German officers and soldiers kill Jewish people give goose pimples because they're precisely unthinkable). Throughout his sufferings, chance didn't totally relinquish him: he was rescued at the last minute by a Polish policeman (and a fellow of his brother) who stopped him from going up in the train of death to Auschwitz. At this moment, he was saved from death but he lost his family. Then, he had to rely on his courage to survive and enjoyed the help of some fellows even if they absconded (the woman Spilzman made the acquaintance at the beginning of the film and her husband who found him a flat). At last, the German officer at the end of the film, was his ultimate glimmer of hope.Roman Polanski shot his film with a classic but startling directing for the sake of detail and realism. It has a linear but inevitable progression which has the look of a downward spiral: the tightening of the restrictions on Jewish people which become increasingly harsher (the armband to distinguish the Jewish from other peoples, then the delimitation and the encircling of the ghetto, the Jews chased away from their neighborhood and deported to the extermination camps) and the least sign of certainty is nearly automatically blighted: ""we have work certificates at last"" sighs Spilzman's father. Alas! Hopes blighted since just as he pronounces these words, a German officer asks them with other people to go outside. Some of them are killed while the others (including Spilzman's family) have to wait on a large square with thousands of others. Polanski also relates notable events with a minimum of means (the fight and shooting sequences are often perceived from a balcony or a window).The second part of the film strongly recalls Polanski's murkiest hours extracted from his masterworks. For example, in his flat, Spilzman tries to be as quiet as possible and while searching for food in his kitchen and drops crockery. The noise makes his neighbor intervene and by giving the alarm in the building obliges him to flee once again. At this moment, we find one of Polanski's trademarks: the eerie neighbor who has a harmful influence on the hero and contributes to his or her fall (the Castevet in ""Rosemary's Baby"", the offbeat inhabitants of the building in ""the Tenant"". In another extent, when Spilzman has to lurk in the destroyed ghetto (the distant shot where we can see him trudging in the ruins of this apocalyptic landscape deserves to rank among Polanski's most notable shots in all his filmography), Polanski really places us amid a ""in camera"" in spite of the sprawling scenery.The filmmaker should also be thanked for having chosen Adrien Brody in the main role. He works wonders in a part which seemed to be tailor-made for him, a far cry from his cardboard character in M Night Shyamalan's ""the Village"" (2004). He can act several persona in himself: a smart young man as well as a dirty and bearded tramp. His angular face, his acute and melancholic countenance stay with us for a long time. As for the German officers, they are often caricatured but ultimately Polanski eschews the trap of Manicheism which seemed to pervade the whole film thanks to the last sequences with the sympathetic German officer. Not all Nazis were beasts...Interspersed with either unbearable, either excruciating or either moving sequences and with striking shots, ""the Pianist"" has its place on the podium of Polanski's towering achievements. See it any costs! Unfortunately it would seem that the flame began to flicker again given the lukewarm critics ""Oliver Twist"" met this year. The slump again? Only time will tell..."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 28, 2023",10/10,"Polish musician Wladyslaw Szpillman tries to cope with life in Naxi occupied Warsaw.I only recently watched Schindler's list, and was so moved, IMDb recommended The Pianist, and I was not disappointed, this was an incredibly powerful, moving, but upsetting movie.It charts the sequence of events, first the Polish Jews are moved from their homes, robbed, and placed into ghettos, made to wear a star of David, then finally moved into Concentration Camps.It just amazes me to think how and why these atrocities actually happened, still in living memory for some, surely one of the most shocking times in human history. You see the violence ramp up as the film progresses.It's an incredibly well made film, it looks terrific, people look very much of that time, surely a consideration the casting director used.Several things that always stayed with me, someone begging with a corpse laying on the ground that was one moment, another being the elderly man in the wheelchair, harrowing sequences.I thought Adrien Brody was excellent as Szpillman, a very understated performance, totally sincere, incredibly believable. Ed Stoppard, Frank Findlay, Maureen Lipman and others all so good.It's a long film, but incredibly rewarding.10/10."
sddavis63,"Nov 4, 2009",6/10,"The first thing that should be said is that this is most definitely more than a Holocaust movie. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long. As much as was accomplished in that running time could have been accomplished in two hours flat. It's a good movie, but just failed to reach the level of greatness that some have assigned to it. 6/10"
dbborroughs,"Aug 7, 2005",4/10,"I don't know what to say about this move other than it really didn't movie me. Sure Adrian Brody is excellent as the Pianist of the title who hides out in Warsaw as the city is destroyed around him, but I never really connected to the story. I never really cared. I'm not sure if its poor film making or simply the fact that for me this seemed as been there and done that. Many of the things that I dislike in the well financed movies concerning the Holocaust came into play, in particular the fact that everything looks so nice as to be unreal. I also have the sense that the film is insisting that I like and respect it simply because of the subject matter. Its not that simple you have to give me characters and a good story before I care. Unfortunately while Brody is an excellent actor however I never connected to him. I never had a reason to care other than what happened was truly remarkable, which means this movie meant nothing to me. This film is a major disappointment"
evanston_dad,"Aug 4, 2010",9/10,"Before seeing ""The Pianist,"" I thought there couldn't possibly be a movie about the Holocaust that could tell me something I didn't already know, or make me feel an emotion I haven't already felt a hundred times before about the topic. But director Roman Polanski proved me wrong.There's a scene in ""The Pianist"" in which Nazis invade a Jewish apartment building and ""clean out"" its tenants. They pick up an elderly man confined to a wheelchair, carry the chair to the edge of the balcony, and casually tip him over the edge to fall to his death on the pavement below. The moment shocked me in a way that nothing in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" did, I think precisely because, unlike Spielberg, Polanski isn't interested in manipulating his audience into feeling something. The strength of his movies has always been that they unfold with a detached, objective point of view and let audiences draw their own conclusions. The scene described above is so shocking because Polanski does nothing to embellish it and therefore never draws attention to the fact that you're watching a movie.The rest of the film is like that -- it's harrowing and unpleasant at times, but it also rewards the viewer by saying something about a historical event when I didn't think there was anything left to say.Grade: A"
ElMaruecan82,"Jun 1, 2012",10/10,"To think that I avoided ""The Pianist"" for about 10 years because I expected a new ""Schindler's List""! And I don't even mean that negatively.I've watched Spielberg's film several times and know too well how painful Holocaust movies are, and while ""Life is Beautiful"" was a tragicomic fable and ""Sophie's Choice"" more of a character study relating a traumatic experience, I knew ""The Pianist"" would be on the same level of ambition and seriousness than Spielberg's film, if only because it was directed by Roman Polanski, a Holocaust survivor himself. I knew the movie would feature shocking arbitrary executions and poignant separations, so in a way, ""The Pianist"" was already having an impact on me without watching it. But this is not the only reason why I didn't feel the urge to watch it.Part of the blame is to be put on the film itself although it was inevitably going to be compared with its 'glorious' predecessor. Speaking of my own experience, I was mislead by ""The Pianist"" and the movie trailers. I thought it was the story of a man who played music for the Nazis and his survival, and therefore found in the present's horror and gloominess a heaven of escapism in the inner, universal and timeless beauty of music. Wladislaw would have the state of mind of one of Schindler's factory workers with music as the same weapon as Guido's humor and optimism in ""Life is Beautiful"". Of course, I realize now how my preconceived ideas totally underestimated Roman Polanski and I hope this review redeems my 10 years of abstinence.First, one must give to Spielberg what is Spielberg's and to Polanski what is Polanski's. ""Schindler's List"" is a better directed film but ""The Pianist"" is a better told story. And while the directing of Spielberg betrays sometimes the harshness of its subject by too much 'mise en scene', Polanski's ability to hook our hearts to the fate of Wladislaw Spillman, magnificently portrayed by Adrien Brody, and his family is beyond words. Indeed, we feel like part of this family. While the epic scope of ""Schindler's List"" provided a sort of moral aura to the victims, making the film a martyrdom's remembrance, ""The Pianist"" is simply the chronicles of a banal horror. And Polanski keeps an intimate, almost unnoticeable directing, to better convey the feeling that we're watching normal people whose lives are dramatically affected by an absurd War, and it's their very normality that emphasizes the cruelty of the Nazi treatment.The film opens in Warsaw in September 1939 so those with a minimum of historical knowledge understand the implication. Wladislaw is playing Chopin in a studio when the first German bombings are heard, his family wants to leave but later, they learn in the radio that France and Britain entered the War. Relieved, they celebrate the news with a toast, and the relatively cheerful ambiance contrasts with the usual demonstrations of grief and pain. Of course, we know the worst is to come, but Polanski takes his time to get us immersed in the war's ambiance and letting us observe the progressive decline of the Spillmans, directly mirroring the atmosphere that probably prevailed within all the Jewish families.Through the Spillman's perspectives, we get a more accurate idea of the nightmare endured by Polish Jews. When they're all parked in the Warsaw ghetto, before the inevitable evacuation, we witness gut-wrenching, intolerable, and acts of brutality, so unbelievably gratuitous and horrific, we never doubt that they're based on true stories, and that war, definitely, inspires the worst from humanity. In war, there's no room for dignity, for charity, for understanding, for God I would even say. As for violence, there is no scale, soldiers throwing off a balcony an old grandfather on a wheelchair because he couldn't stand is a horrifying sight, but maybe I expected these kind of moments so much that I was more shocked by the part where the soldiers made people dance together. Sometimes, humiliations are more impacting than random and arbitrary killings.And again, the talent of Polanski is precisely not to have overplayed on the directing department: no 'Black and White', no special effects, no 'little girl in Red', just basic colors, as to sustain the feeling of a present, more real then more horrific. ""Schindler's List"" might be a better film for some, but it's still a film, while ""The Pianist"" is a survival story, raw and real. Not a hero, not a victim either, the main protagonist will sometimes count on his courage, sometimes on his good luck, sometimes on the help of good-hearted and understanding people, from any sides. There is a light of hope in the film, through music, at a time where humanity reached its lowest point, music was here to remind people, to remind Nazis what a waste the War was, a feeling incarnated by Adrien Brody's sad-looking eyes.Again, don't expect a hero à la Oskar Schindler in Wladislaw, ""The Pianist"" shows the boldness of a period where cowardice was sometimes guided by survival instinct, where the desire to live could be more necessary than the desire to fight, because surviving left more voices to speak about the atrocities. ""The Pianist"" reveals those hidden subtleties that couldn't be truly expressed in epic movies. Some Jews didn't fight back precisely because the horrors of Auschwitz, Treblinka, Buchenwald had to be known, and ironically, this was one of the reasons that accelerated the exterminations' process. And some like Wladislaw had to hide not to make the sacrifices of the others unnecessary, those were tough times and no one is allowed to put a judgment... not us, anyway.And this is why ""The Pianist"" is more affecting than ""Schindler's List"", and if one has any doubt, let's not forget, that Spielberg was born in 1946 while Roman Polanski is still a war survivor who lost his mother in a Death Camp."

RM851222,"Mar 13, 2025",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Pianist"" (2002) is a great movie. Its a survival story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a famous Polish musician who faced the horrors of WW2 and Holocaust in Warsaw, Poland. ""The Pianist"" is a depressing film for sure as it showed the grim realities of naci's occupied country and their brutal and unhuman actions made during WW2. But as for a film itself - it truly is Roman Polanski's masterpiece. I've seen it multiple times during years, and its a one film that is made so well, that it captures your attention from the opening scene till last frame. Its a highly involving film that is directed exceptionally well. Acting was superb by Adrian Brody. Set design and cinematography were really outstanding as this movie delivers its viewers to a 40's Warsaw. But its the storytelling of a great script that is a highlight of ""The Pianist"".Overall, Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is a great movie. Its a reminder of an unspeakable things that happened during WW2, and one mans will to survive and his extraordinary tale of survival. Its an exceptionally directed film that ranks among the very best and most memorable WW2 movie ever made."
lukereese-03580,"Jun 26, 2024",9/10,"One of the most poignant and memorable scenes in ""The Pianist"" is when Szpilman (played by Adrien Brody) plays the piano for German officer Captain Wilm Hosenfeld (played by Thomas Kretschmann) in a ruined building. This moment is a powerful intersection of humanity, art, and survival amidst the horrors of World War II.Emotional Intensity:The scene is charged with emotional intensity. Szpilman, emaciated and broken, is given a rare opportunity to play the piano after years of hiding and struggling for survival. The music he plays is a haunting reminder of his lost world and the cultural devastation of the war.The interaction between Szpilman and Captain Hosenfeld highlights the complexity of human nature. Hosenfeld, a German officer, shows compassion and a sense of humanity by allowing Szpilman to play and later helping him survive. This contrasts sharply with the brutality typically associated with the occupying forces, adding depth to both characters."
Xstal,"Oct 28, 2020",7/10,"Around 30% of Warsaw's population was Jewish in 1939, about 375,000 people; with refugees, the population of the ghetto rose to 450,000 - over 80,000 perished in it; deportations to Treblinka began in July 1942 (Yad Vashem).I would rather have seen this film in the languages of those it portrays using actors from the countries and regions where these despicable, heinous and unforgivable events took place. It would have made an already immensely powerful reflection even more so."
Poseidon-3,"Jan 19, 2004",N/A,"Far from the first motion picture to deal with the Holocaust and unlikely to be the last, this is nevertheless a stunning piece of film.  Brody portrays the title character (based on an actual person) who plays piano on Polish radio until the Nazi invasion of his country makes it impossible to continue.  Through his eyes, the audience witnesses the continual, seemingly-unstoppable dehumanization of Brody and his family and the virtual destruction of Poland.  The journey that this character takes, undoubtedly enhanced by director Polanski's own recollection of his early life, is almost incomprehensible.  Since so many films have been released on this subject, one can't help noticing the similarity to other movies and the familiarity of the situations depicted in the opening scenes.  However, the utter craftsmanship of this film and the casting (nothing short of perfection down the very last role) set this apart until the story's uniqueness kicks in.  Brody is nothing short of magnificent.  His face reflects (naturally and without mugging) the soulfulness, humiliation and deprivation of his character.  Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland.  Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity.  There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.)  What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times.  Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing.  That is not to say that the film is easy to watch.  Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody.  The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films. If there are any faults in the film, they are few.  Perhaps some of Brody's experiences seem repetitive at times and the depiction of Germans sometimes approaches caricature.  However, all is forgiven as the story reaches its heart-stopping moment when Brody is attempting to open an all-important can of food.  Here the film reaches brilliance.  Clearly, the film is not going to appeal to the shallow or the disinterested, but to those who have a fondness for striking, deeply-felt and lovingly-told stories, this one is hard to top."
fabian-perez-r,"Mar 5, 2025",9/10,"The Pianist is a hauntingly powerful film that masterfully portrays the resilience of the human spirit amidst the horrors of war. Adrien Brody delivers a breathtaking performance as Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish pianist struggling to survive the Nazi occupation of Poland. Director Roman Polanski crafts a deeply emotional and visually striking narrative that captures both the brutality and fleeting moments of hope in Szpilman's journey. I had put off watching it for 23 years, knowing it would be an intense experience, and it truly was, but every moment was worth it. The film's authenticity, gripping storytelling, and moving score make it an unforgettable cinematic experience."
giannismagfy,"May 9, 2019",10/10,"I saw this movie mainly because I play the piano and wanted to see whats going on. It was 1am when it started and wanted to see just few mins.I ended up 4am whith my mind full of thoughts.
This is the most raw movie Ive ever seen.Very realistic and raw scenes and script that describes the Nazi invasion very accurate.
Very hard to watch film, especialy for more sensitive people. I personaly dont get sensitive with movies and I handle violence scenes , but this is not about violence, its about war rawness and unbelievable documents. (Dead kids rotting on roads, Nazi killing random people, execution , etc.)
Amazing acting , music and director.Also heard iconic Chopin pieces, but notice that the film isn't about the piano but about the pianist."
AndrsM-90,"May 18, 2025",10/10,"Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is not merely a film; it is a profound and deeply affecting cinematic experience that resonates long after the final credits roll. Released in 2002, this masterpiece, based on the autobiographical memoir of the Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, stands as a testament to the resilience of the human spirit amidst the unimaginable horrors of the Holocaust. Polanski, himself a survivor of the Kraków Ghetto, imbues the film with an unflinching realism and a personal understanding that elevates it beyond a simple historical account.The film's brilliance lies in its intimate portrayal of Szpilman's survival. Adrien Brody delivers a tour-de-force performance, capturing the pianist's initial artistic passion, his growing fear and desperation as the Nazi occupation intensifies, and finally, his almost feral struggle for existence. Brody's physical transformation throughout the film is remarkable, mirroring Szpilman's gradual descent from a respected musician to a gaunt shadow haunted by the loss of his family and his world. His portrayal is nuanced and deeply empathetic, allowing the audience to connect with Szpilman's inner turmoil and his unwavering will to live.Polanski's direction is masterful. He avoids sensationalism, instead focusing on the stark realities of life in the Warsaw Ghetto and the subsequent destruction of the city. The camera work is often observational, placing the viewer alongside Szpilman as he witnesses the escalating brutality and the systematic dehumanization of his people. The long, silent stretches, particularly after Szpilman is separated from his family, are incredibly powerful, emphasizing his isolation and the oppressive silence of a world devoid of humanity. These moments allow the audience to contemplate the enormity of the loss and the fragility of life.The film's sound design is particularly noteworthy. The absence of music for long periods underscores the pervasive fear and the disruption of Szpilman's artistic life. When music does appear, it is often diegetic, emanating from a nearby radio or Szpilman's own desperate attempts to play on abandoned pianos. These moments of music serve as poignant reminders of the beauty and humanity that are being systematically extinguished. The final scene, where Szpilman plays Chopin's Nocturne in C sharp minor for the German officer, Captain Wilm Hosenfeld, is particularly moving. The music transcends the boundaries of language and nationality, offering a brief moment of shared humanity in the midst of unimaginable cruelty.""The Pianist"" is also a powerful historical document. It offers a visceral and unflinching depiction of the Holocaust, avoiding romanticization or simplification. The film portrays the gradual erosion of rights, the forced confinement in the ghetto, the deportations to extermination camps, and the brutal realities of survival in the ruins of Warsaw. Polanski's personal connection to the subject matter lends an authenticity that is palpable. The destruction of the Warsaw Ghetto is depicted with harrowing realism, turning the once vibrant city into a landscape of rubble and despair.Beyond the historical context, the film explores universal themes of survival, resilience, and the enduring power of art. Szpilman's music becomes both a source of solace and a means of connection, even in his isolation. His ability to find moments of beauty amidst the horror underscores the indomitable nature of the human spirit. The unexpected act of kindness from Captain Hosenfeld, who risks his own life to help Szpilman, offers a glimmer of hope in the darkness and highlights the complexity of human nature even within the context of war.In conclusion, ""The Pianist"" is a cinematic triumph. It is a powerful, moving, and ultimately unforgettable film that honors the memory of the Holocaust while celebrating the resilience of the human spirit. Adrien Brody's Oscar-winning performance is captivating, and Roman Polanski's direction is both sensitive and unflinching. The film's masterful storytelling, evocative cinematography, and poignant use of music create an immersive and deeply affecting experience. ""The Pianist"" is not just a historical drama; it is a profound meditation on survival, loss, and the enduring power of art in the face of unimaginable adversity. It is a film that demands to be seen and remembered."
RubberCanoe,"Oct 16, 2025",8/10,"What makes this stand apart from other holocaust movies is adding a new detail about Jews who were complicit in the murder of Jews, but also what had to be done to survive. This presents a more human story to this but also brings it closer to home with the standout performance by Adrian Brody at the center of the film that is about his family during the holocaust. 6 million dead is being shown through the personal tragedy of one."
jgcorrea,"Aug 10, 2025",10/10,"This is a necessary testimony. Pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman recounts his years of survival in the Warsaw ghetto. Fear, hunger, and cold, amplified by the Nazi occupation. In this hell, a few musical notes resonate to keep hope alive. Then comes the unexpected gesture of a German officer, whose distressed intervention closes the film. Through words, images from Roman Polanski's film can come back to us, say, in the form of a haiku:
Dialogue essential
A few notes on a piano
You can survive hell."
Vixo_Six,"Jul 15, 2025",10/10,"The Pianist left me completely in shock. I had heard about it before, but I never thought it would be this good. It's a raw, moving, and profoundly human film that portrays the horrors of war without resorting to sensationalism. Adrien Brody's performance is flawless, conveying his character's suffering, loneliness, and fragile hope with both subtlety and strength. Roman Polanski's direction is masterful, paying attention to every detail to make the story feel as real as it is devastating. This is one of those films you don't just watch, but truly feel, and it stays with you long after it ends."
Steffi_P,"Apr 5, 2012",9/10,"The Pianist is a movie that often gets bundled together with Schindler's List as being ""about"" the holocaust. But this is a misunderstanding, a simplification even, of this picture (and of Schindler's List). It relates to the holocaust, but it is not the story of the holocaust – it's the story of one man. Władisław Szpilman was an artist, with great talent in his hands and his mind, and in him is represented something very precious in humanity. He also appears, as many such people really are, someone to whom the music mattered far more than current affairs. As such, he provides a unusual view on atrocity, that of someone who, rather than actively fight against it, for the most part tried simply to exist in spite of it.This somewhat passive yet dignified stance is ably reflected in Roman Polanski's direction, which has always been characterised by an excruciating intimacy with his subjects and a certain detachment from the world in which they inhabit. Here we see Szpilman glimpsing the war through windows and doorways, yet often himself or his hands in close-up. But Polanski's boldest strokes of genius are in his creation and presentation of the ghetto and its inhabitants, especially as regards how he draws our attention. The soldiers giving a cigarette to an elderly Jewish man and the couple fighting over a can of stew are foregrounded. Seconds later, a corpse lies innocuously in the background. When Władek's father is accosted by two Germans, we see a couple of Polish women hastily get out of the way. When the shot changes to reveal the officer's back, the focus is suddenly on his gun holster – it draws our attention to things that give a little extra breadth and context to a scene.Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted – when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance."
theeviltritone,"Jul 21, 2003",1/10,"This movie taught me that Jews suffered unspeakably during the Nazi occupation of Poland. Much thanks for the history lesson -- now how about some good acting? script? plot?For a movie about a guy who plays the piano, this spends most of it's time showing him walking around and watching bad things happening to others.I thought this movie was generally a waste of time. Where Schindler's List was poetic, beautiful and touching, this movie was just boring, empty and derivative. Alternating scenes of bland lament and violent, pointless sadism.If you're looking for a film to stimulate your heart, your mind, and your conscience, look somewhere else. This movie delivers none of that."
wallplanner,"Jan 15, 2004",N/A,"From the opening moments of this movie Polanski layers on the symbolism with a trowel. Gunshots and bombs disrupt Szpilman's piano playing, they have to hide their money in his father's violin, the nazis throw their neighbour out the window for no reason god oh god will it never end- and  that's just the beginning. Once the Szpilman's move into the ghetto Polanksi dispenses with the trowel, grabs us by the back of our necks and suffocates us face down into the bewildering grimy b-movie that was the Jewish experience of the second world war. His characters step over dead bodies on the sidewalk, and weave their way through crowds of parent-less children and distraught wives. There is always someone crying or wailing in the background. The nazis are brutal and grotesque with inane grins on their faces as they commit bizarre atrocities. The ghetto is a constant nightmarish gotham but, unlike Spielberg, Polanski refuses to couch this in artistic black and white, instead forcing us to view it all in the cold light of day. The colours are muted yes, but this has nothing to do with lens filters and everything to do with the layers of dirt that cover the city- a literal reminder of the s*** they have to live under everyday. Under Polanski's direction, every aspect of daily life is an exaggerated contribution to ghetto hell, the soundtrack is turned up way loud so that even chewing food and eating gruel is an interruption to intellgent thought. Polanksi is unashamedly symbolic and why not- he's got a point to get across and by god he's going to force it to its absolute limit. This is a movie deliberately directed at the west-- Polanski redefines the horrors of the ghetto by giving his characters the hearty english accents of childhood classics like The Railway Children. By doing this, he forces the viewer to frame Polish Jews inside the gentle 'civilised' culture we associate with the educated British accent, rather than a Polish or Jewish accent which most western movie makers portray as, at best, lower class and at worst, comical. And in the middle of this chaos is the relentlessly transcendent Szpilman. But this is no heroic champion of the people, he doesn't run guns, or operate an underground railway, he saves no one's life except his own, he doesn't fight the Germans he runs from them. This is a man who is persecuted by everybody: ghetto-ised by the nazis, starved and left to die by a man who is supposed to help him, and then, eventually, abandoned by the world. He wanders through the surreal ruins of the town like a man on an alien planet. Unable to find food or water, limping, thin as a rake a bearded Jesus-like figure. He is the ultimate victim - frustratingly passive, seemingly unaware of the political, always watching from behind a curtain, only ever active when its almost too late, if at all, operating on instinctual levels of self-preservation that have nothing to do with skill or bravery and is ultimately self-centred. He is a mundane every-man who is, literally, yellow- his cowardlyness physically manifested as he suffers from jaundice.So what makes us accept his salvation against the millions of others we know who died during WWII? Largely it's his phenomenal talent on the piano that gives him an excuse to bow out of the fight. His obsession with music gives him a voice even when he can't use it, and a way of escaping the muck of war. He spends his time in hiding imagining piano pieces rather than plotting revenge. Intelligent audiences today understand that vengeance is never simple, that every act of violence has a consequence, even if you're the good guy fighting the bad guys, nobody is ever completely bad or completely good.. In the end, his final saviour is a nazi soldier. We would never have believed this soldier's grace possible if it hadn't been for Spzilman's lack of hatred in the movie. Some might call him a wimp for his inability to fight the Germans, but it's his refusal to sink to the level of mindless fighter that leads to his salvation.This is the first movie of Polanski's  that has managed to thoroughly pull me in- usually he doesn't do it for me at all, maybe because he's so deliberately unsubtle? Whatever it was that he did differently it worked this time- I was so involved- longing for Spzilman to do something, fight someone, or at least for god's sake find some food.  That beautiful, delicate, completely expressive encounter with the piano and the nazi somehow encompasses the point of the whole movie in a way I can't explain and don't fully understand. Polanksi takes us on a journey that peaks at the moment where it is the most gentle- very unusual and something that doesn't always work. But somehow, here, it does."

tanya-63,"May 28, 2002",10/10,"There may have been better written films about the holocaust - but this is without the most authentic and touching account I have seen since Claude Lanzmann's epic documentary ""Shoah"" - as you might expect from director Polanski, himself a child survivor of the Krakov and Warsaw ghettos.Here he eschews melodrama, and the pornography of violence to present of film which is full of love, life and hope amidst terrible events."
Krome,"Aug 8, 2003",8/10,"Generally, I skim through the user comments on IMDB taking great pleasure in seeing what others have to say about the film I've just seen. Today, though, I feel astonished and disappointed by some of the things I've read.The holocaust occurred for many reasons; social, economic and political. However, what fuelled it was a colossal failure of the basic human qualities of compassion, empathy and understanding. It's a nauseating paradox, repeated throughout human history, that when people are regarded as fit only for slavery and destruction it is their persecutors who are made truly subhuman by their actions.I'm not attempting to label the authors of some of the posts here as Nazis or fascists but I am deeply concerned that a film dealing with this issue can provoke such truly thoughtless comments. Of course, it's possible to accuse The Pianist of failing in its ambitions if it cannot convey to every viewer at least a fleeting sympathy with the characters. Perhaps, though, it succeeds by highlighting the lack of comprehension that makes obscenities like the Holocaust possible even today.Maybe some people viewed the film as simply entertainment, in which case I can see why the plot or characterisation might not be to their liking. The Nazis just keep on behaving like thugs, the Jews sit there and take it and the central character doesn't finally go on a revenge killing-spree, liberating Warsaw single-handed. And getting the girl, of course. If you want formulaic movies with sympathetic heroes and a nice, untaxing storyline there are plenty to choose from. I just don't see how anyone could watch this film without understanding that it's about as close to the truth as it could be without passing into the realm of dramatised documentary. Yes, it is based on a true story and sorry - real life has a habit of occasionally deviating from the popcorn norm.So, sorry to pick on the following. Genuinely, it's not personal - your comments are simply the most recent.musidora - If you found it hard to relate to the selfishness of Szpilman perhaps you might consider that many, many Holocaust survivors report an ineradicable guilt, even in the face of all they endured, because they owed their own survival to putting themselves first. For example theft of food in concentration camps was common. What do you think you would do in the same situation if the price of your life, or your child's, were a crust of stolen bread?kylan-1 - You wrote: `He just stands there with a dumb look on his face and fumbles around'   `So whats the big survival story here?'Seriously, if you were malnourished, cold and being used for slave labour do you think you'd be feeling chipper enough to be a modern-day Spartacus?jmrex - You wrote: `How can anybody enjoy watching a chronicle of how lacking in spirit these people were? It sickens me.'It really is hard to understand how a whole people can sometimes kneel before its oppressor, seemingly without putting up a fight. How can people be so passive in such extreme circumstances? How can they just stand by while their neighbour is murdered and quietly wait their turn? Well, the same thing happens every time the human race decides to turn on itself. From Poland to Cambodia to Rwanda you can see it repeated. Plainly, it's something that happens when a society is reduced to its component individuals and the moment of rebellion seems to each an impossibility. If anything is sickening here, it's your comment, jmrex. If you truly find the concept of human despair something inferior to you in some way then let's put another point on the scoreboard for the Nazis. If all you want to do is simply enjoy a film and leave it feeling better than when you entered the cinema then look for something different next time. The audience leaving the screening I saw were subdued and said their goodbyes to one another with choked voices. That doesn't make any of them better people than you but I think it shows a maturity that you haven't yet reached. I wish you well on your journey there - you'll find the view much better.Bhagwan Thadani  - You wrote: `The entire movie was so ""outre"" that I actually laughed when a German officer pulled out his Luger and shot a Jewess to death for asking ""Where are we going?"" How ridiculous can this myth of the Jew suffering at the hands of persecutors become?'Please tell me you're not serious. That you know this really went on. I simply cannot understand how anyone with even a passing knowledge of the Holocaust could really think this an exaggeration or regard it as a `myth.' Perhaps you should find the time to talk to some of the people whose families were reduced to a handful of individuals or even just a sole survivor. Maybe if you heard from someone who was there, still carrying the tattoo on their arm used to mark them like cattle, how their mothers, fathers, siblings and children were murdered you might begin to understand how woundingly misinformed you are. The Jews, gypsies, gays, dissidents and other victims of the Nazis were slaughtered both systematically and capriciously. If your life is worthless to someone with power over you then it is a matter of no consequence all to them to end it for the slightest reason.While blindness to the suffering of others, whoever and wherever they may be, remains a part of the human condition the subjects of movies like The Pianist will be not only moving but a salutary warning. It could happen to any of us unless we appreciate the lessons history offers."
BluDiMado,"Oct 19, 2012",10/10,"I believe this movie to be one of the most excellent movies of our times. It has several aspects that make it especially great. Firstly, the music, the most important feature of this movie, in my opinion. Chopin nocturnes and polonaises are perfectly chosen and arrayed to create an unforgettable atmosphere. In one scene, they even take time to play the whole piece of music, without interfering. Secondly, the actors in the movie: none of them are/were really well known, but WOW! (for lack of a better word). Thirdly, it's one of the few movies, where you can actually watch the credits (forever) and wish the movie wouldn't end.Personally, I think it's a perfect 10/10."
ml8878,"May 21, 2005",8/10,"""Crap, I rented the History Channel."" That was my initial reaction when I was met with a 20 second long, low-detailed, roll-footage type introduction to The Pianist. I knew I didn't need another lecture on the ""horrific Nazi death camps"" and one more dull lesson on World War II weaved into what Hollywood puts out as a ""movie."" However, about 10 minutes into the film, I was captivated. As the story began to unfold the life of a large and happy Jewish family living in Warsaw at the beginning of World War II, I started to see traces of genius in Polanski's newest creation.For one, each character had a personality so tangible that the viewers can point out resemblances in their own personal lives. This had a stunning impact on me. It just isn't the same when a story is always about that ""someone else."" However, Polanski did an awesome job in making that ""someone else"" personal. One of my own favorite characters was Henryk (played by Ed Stoppard), the brother of the ""pianist"" (Wladek Szpilman-played by Adrien Brody), who had a stubborn, intellectual, street-smart whim to him that I can identify in a few of my own friends. Of course, Brody was a great actor as well. His passive, stoic response flowed from a seemingly natural-born personality that was so fitting to his character. His personality was never out of place or awkward but well-blended into the climate set by Polanski.Secondly, the director had an excellent charm with the mood of the cinematic. It's interesting to point out that the sky had nearly always been dark and dreary. The clouds and the overall attitude of the film were grey and overcast. They resembled harbingers of a coming storm. It was symbolic, and also foreshadows the coming doom that few people expected and even fewer had hoped to avoid. Polanski, himself a Pole who escaped the grips of death in the camps, spared few shades of darkness in painting the Nazis. Next, it must be noted that Polanski was a master at contrasting mood. A tragically horrifying scene could be followed by a scene with Wladek playing the piano beautifully in a bustling restaurant. By doing this, Polanski noticeably heightens the blow of the calamity and as a result, made the movie so much more spectacular.Also helping to set the sinister mood was the music, which was stunningly beautiful yet overwhelmingly poignant. From Chopin's ""Nocturne for Piano in C Sharp Minor"" at the very beginning to Chopin's ""Andante Spianato and Grande Polonaise for Piano, Op. 22"" at the very end, the bittersweet sweet aura of the movie cannot exist without the music. One of the best classical soundtracks of the past years may be from this very movie. The piano genius, Szpilman, represented all the talents wasted away by Nazi rule. Lawyers, writers, politicians, and musicians alike were the subjects of those mass graves and human ovens, and the trills of the keys made it so real, so heartfelt. It was something one needs to experience to know the truth of.I encountered only a few moments of discontent when watching this movie. One of them was that some of the characters seemed quite random and generally impromptu. Itzak Heller for example, the Jewish Police recruiter, seemed to appear out of nowhere, yet the family speaks of him as if he was an old friend. Other parts of the story I felt needed a little bit more elaboration as well. What annoyed me the most was that the director seemed to part with the rest of the family in the middle of the film without ever mentioning them again. However, since this is not a spoiler, I have no need to go into the details.No, I have yet to see a movie that is perfect in every aspect. Though in this human world of flaws and opinions differing from mine, I forfeit my dissatisfaction at the beginning of this film to admit that this has been one awesome experience. It has not only changed my view on Polanski as a director, but also the entire period of the Holocaust in general."
gavin6942,"May 19, 2010",7/10,"I don't have much to say on this movie, other than that it was very good. Adrien Brody is a fine actor and this is probably his finest role (though I'm partial to ""The Jacket"").My only real concern with this film ,and it shouldn't be seen as a slight against it, is that it seems that making a film about the Holocaust makes a film automatically better. I'm not sure if it's because it evokes emotions or what, but this film, ""Schindler's List"" and others quickly rise to the top of the list of good films... World War II in general seems to do this, but the Holocaust even more so. It's an odd phenomenon."
Doylenf,"Jun 11, 2003",N/A,"Words are inadequate to describe the flawless flow of events in this absorbing account of Polish Jews facing extinction in the Warsaw Ghetto of the '40s during the Nazi reign of terror.Surely the most deserving Oscar award in years was bestowed on Adrien Brody who captures his character completely and carries the film with his amazingly real performance. He is at the center of vision throughout most of the action--so perfect in his role that he makes the story an unforgettable experience. His confrontation with a Nazi officer who discovers his hiding place and then asks him to prove that he is a pianist by playing the piano, is just one of the memorable highlights. This scene alone was justification for Brody's Oscar.Roman Polanski's direction is masterful throughout, never allowing the story to bog down in sentimentality but keeping the focus on survival and some of the horrific things that happen along the way.An inspired piece of filmmaking that is stunning to watch because it is so real and moving. Not since SCHINDLER'S LIST has the brutality and epic sweep of World War II been captured so accurately."
Sandcooler,"May 5, 2008",10/10,"I don't go as far as saying holocaust movies are vanity projects of directors showing that they too can make an epic.But where Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" was somewhere way in the distance and ages ago,""The Pianist"" puts you in the action with the old trick of having a main character you care about.Bit by piece we get to see the downfall of the Jewish community in well,everywhere.Originally they just get discriminated and won't get to do anything to be anywhere,but are still members of society who usually don't get killed.Then it gets ugly.The ghettos,the incredible lack of everything,the random executions,I knew they existed but never have they seemed so sincere on behalf of the makers.What to say about an old man eating what appears to be liquid corn straight of the road?Eventually we learn yet again that the holocaust in fact,really made no sense.We're talking about Western Europe here,and it isn't even a long time ago.People were somewhat educated,thought for themselves when the Gestapo wasn't watching,and still most of them just went along with this crap.I was fearing a ""Night Of The Living Dead""-style ending,but this is based on an autobiography so that would have been impossible.Five years of hate packed in about two hours,and it works."
diane-34,"Mar 12, 2005",10/10,"Fortunately my wife convinced me to see this film on TV several nights ago; initially I was reluctant because I thought that it would end up being too tough for a overly sensitive softy like myself-how wrong I was! Polanski's film was not what I had expected; in all the publicity surrounding his return to films, I had failed to grasp the substance of the film. In hindsight this surprises me because for many years I have been curious as to why film makers had not focused on the extraordinary events of the Warsaw Ghetto and its eventual destruction by the Nazis. I have always thought that this event was one of the most powerful of a string of events that have been overlooked by film makers for years. The enormity of all that happened from '38 to '45 seem to have prevented people from mining the history of those years. It is conceivable that producers feel there is a fatigue clause at work here, meaning that there is possibly a feeling by producers that the public might be tired of non-military war films. Another possibility concerns the Jewish people themselves-a concern that they do not want this terribly painful history to be mined simply to provide fodder for film makers. Whatever the reason, there is to my mind a noticeable absence of films about these monumental but painful events of the mid twentieth century.Even given the drawbacks associated with watching a film on the small screen, this movie immediately gave the impression that it had the touch of genius about it. Polanski's superb direction; Brody's superb acting and Edelman's brilliant cinematography impart the stamp of excellence on the film. I am a film viewer who watches films as collections of images so Edelman's work knocked me out! The beauty of the clarity and darkness of the camera work was wonderful to watch. POlanski's shot selection of course allowed Edelman ample canvas upon which to paint in those wonderful grays and muted colours that were eventually seen on the screen.Diane and I have the tape of the film and it will definitely be watched many times in the future. In short, the film is as good as the awards that it justifiably received."
Pedro_H,"Feb 1, 2005",8/10,"Roman Polanski is something of a genius for being in the middle of world history. Even if he had never made a film in his life his autobiography would still have been fascinating and history packed. I won't try and summate it in detail, but it involves an escape not unlike the one presented here on film! Having turned down Schindler's List (for reasons much noted elsewhere) he decides to make this as his tribute to the anti-Jewish horrors of WWII. Interesting.Despite the awards (all deserved) this is not what you might call a ""fat"" film. It has one main theme: ""self preservation"" in a world gone mad and that limits my sympathy and involvement. Indeed the protagonist (Adrian Brody) has something that people can envy even in his darkest hour - a great musical talent.The question I ask myself is how much of this lifesaver influences his decisions? While many gave up or joined in the resistance movement, Brody watches from the window: very much a curious and non Hollywood approach. Brave but not to everyone's taste.The real Warsaw Ghetto was featured in the great Granada documentary series ""The World at War"" (quite frankly the most amazing piece of historical television ever created - if you can rent it do so) and nothing can be as shocking as the real pictures. However this is a close second.The early scenes of family life are like the scenes from the Titanic, we know what those on screen don't and we feel like calling out and warning them! In many ways the information is soft peddled and tokenised. We do not see the actual horrors of the death camps and even post war the survivors look too healthy to be believable. The only bum note in the entire movie.Although I had nothing to do with the making of this film I am proud of it. I am proud that millions of people have been educated and will continue to be educated about the horrors of war and what man does to man. But I didn't really enjoy it very much and I have no desire to see it again despite having some wonderful pieces of cinematography."
lastliberal,"May 28, 2010",9/10,"I have watched a lot of WWII films, but this is at the top of the list.Don't take my word for it, it won three Oscars, and should have won Best Picture; it did win Best Picture at the BAFTA awards, along with a Best Director for Roman Polanski (Chinatown, Rosemary's Baby). This is Polanski's finest film by far.Adrien Brody was magnificent, and his performance made you feel you were right there with him.It wasn't a pretty picture, the outstanding cinematography notwithstanding. Bodies lie in the streets, and people just passed them by. People were shot for asking a simple question. A man was so hungry that when his attempt to steal a woman's soup resulted in it falling to the ground, he fell to the ground and lapped it up.Amidst all the carnage and deprivation, Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) managed to survive until the end. An amazing story."
danielmanson,"Sep 4, 2021",8/10,"Well that's quite a good film isn't it! Really not what I expected from a film called ""the pianist"". I've put this off for so long, because I simply thought it would be really dull. But wow, I've been wrong this whole time.The first hour is spectacular. The camera shots, the acting, the story and the feel of the film was all perfect. It really captured the realism of what it would have been like in them times. The one thing that was done perfectly throughout was that it captured the emotion of the characters and illustrated it so well.Speaking of characters. The arc of Adrien Brody's character was exceptional. Everything about him was done perfectly and it illustrated everything it needed to.Got to give props to Adrien Brody as well, phenomenal performance. Honestly one of the best I've seen in a long time.Only real negative I have to say is that I thought the final hour or so dragged at parts and it didn't need to be as long as it needed to. But this is nit picking.If you haven't seen please do. It's moving, emotional and just damn right amazing."
christopher-underwood,"May 1, 2022",7/10,"Roman Polanski, clearly was keen to make this film, having himself born in Paris in 1933 and then with his parents returning to Krakow three years later. It was a difficult life and he was pleased to tell the story of the pianist who had also had something of a terrible life. It did not have as big a budget as he would have hoped for but the film is done well enough although it is rather long without too much happening."
cbolton121,"Jun 25, 2010",10/10,"This film is simply the greatest of its type ever made. Brilliant directing, acting, and screenplay combines to draw you in to a historically sickening, but at the same time captivating plot. Brody really deserves his Oscar as he brings out the best in 'The Pianist'. His acting is subtle enough to make it feel like sometimes you are not watching a film, but are living through his eyes. At the same time it is also bold and loud enough to make you feel every emotion has his character takes his awful journey.The plot line itself I will leave to you, go and watch this film and have an amazing time doing so!Highly recommended, one of the best films you Will ever see!"
andre-71,"Nov 8, 2002",10/10,"I rarely give a 10 on any movie, but this one got it from me. Unlike other recent movies set in the Nazi era this one realistically tells a story through the eyes of just one person. There were few off-explanations, and there were no sentimental hollywoodish scenes. Further, I liked the cast not only of the major but also of the minor roles. The Germans really acted German, same with the Polish Jews and non-Jews - no glossing over anything. And by not straining after effects the movie gives you a chance to actually feel the sublime (and sometimes not so sublime) fear of the protagonist. Really well done!"
bevo-13678,"Jun 16, 2020",10/10,Great War movie. Sequel to the piano most likely judging by the title
baldwinedwina,"Apr 13, 2023",9/10,"The pianist is telling a story, and I think it tells well. So much suffering, so many places to accuse, incite, and provoke, were all avoided by Polanski using the simplest means of classical narrative techniques. His first pursuit was to tell the story fluently, no matter how much he wanted to express emotions and ideas, he ultimately achieved it. This is something that I know many directors are becoming increasingly difficult to do. Before watching this movie, I was worried that I would leave midway, worried that it would be too dull, but in reality, it felt like I was admiring classical literature in one go. It is full and heavy, but as captivating as Hugo's' Les Miserables'."
Abir-Xtreme,"May 4, 2011",9/10,"How often do you see a movie that is capable of touching your Heart? how often do you see a movie that will occupy your thoughts for a good while? Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" is one of those rare breed of movies that can actually do that. It's undoubtedly one of the most impressive movies you will ever see. From The Solid Direction Of Roman Polanski to the Flawless acting of Adrien Brody This Movie without a doubt can be called a Masterpiece. The Movie is based on The true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, who in the 1930s was considered one of the most accomplished Pianist. But the movie is not about his fame, Nor his Glory as a pianist. It's About A Polish Jew, who fought against all odds, Faced situations that he never even imagined and Finally Survived by losing almost everything and everyone he loved. It shows not only a tale of horrific surviving, but also the emotions that many people had to face and fight in order to live. It makes you wonder how people who really faced and Fought against those odd and lived, makes you ask yourself what would i do in that situation? The Cast is great, Whether it is a important character like Fox as Dorota or Minor character such as Ronan Vibert as Janina's Husband. But Adrian Broody Truly proved his worth as an actor in this film, i mean he was so into the character that he will make you believe that he really is Szpilman, He lost over 14 kilograms and developed a unusual body language for some scenes, and an actor of his level deserve much more recognition, but it's a fact that people nowadays prefer flash and looks over true art, however if you are one of those who can appreciate a true masterpiece you must have a look at ""The Pianist"""
Thanos_Alfie,"Mar 13, 2021",8/10,"""The Pianist"" is a Biography - Drama movie in which we follow the life of a Polish Jewish pianist during World War II who is trying with all of his powers to survive. He sees a lot and he has to deal with many difficulties and surpass a lot of obstacles in order to survive.I liked this movie very much because it is based on true events and it presents very well the true face of World War II. The direction which was made by Roman Polanski, it was for one more time simply exceptional and he created another masterpiece. He succeeded on making us understand how his main character was feeling and made it easier for us to follow his story. The interpretation of Adrien Brody who played as Wladyslaw Szpilman was simply amazing and he deserved the Oscar for Best Actor in a Leading Role. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Emilia Fox's who played as Dorota and Thomas Kretschmann's who played as Captain Wilm Hosenfeld. To sum up, I have to say that ""The Pianist"" is an amazing movie that shows the cruel face of war and I strongly recommend everyone to watch it."
cherylkyrandia,"Apr 16, 2023",9/10,"Adrien Brody does a stellar job in this World War Two film. It tells of a Jewish pianist who finds himself under siege by Nazis and struggling to survive amidst the apocalyptic situation he finds himself in. The film is beautifully shot, written and acted. There's some very hard scenes to watch, inherent of these kinds of films. There's very sudden and unexpected violence. You'll see some pretty helpless moments where you just want to reach into the screen and intervene. The film could be triggering for some, particularly those who are Holocaust survivors. But that's just a testament to how expertly done the film is."
yoyomagoo,"Mar 24, 2003",6/10,"I despise the term overrated (partly because of its often use on IMDB) but this movie is the dictionary definition of the term. How did it win those oscars? Why it is in the top 250? I don't know.Polanski's tribute to the holocaust is a largely pedestrian affair that suffers from a lack of style and tautness. The inclusion of many scenes in the movie is mysterious considering the fact they hold little relevance to either the holocaust or the Brody's character's story. The film therefore feels bloated and self-important. Polanski does not treat the subject matter with any opinion or style- and just shows us what happens before casually strolling onto the next scene. Polanski would argue that this is because the subject matter does not need any style or opinion added to it, which is fair enough. However the problem with this is, that it is extremely dull for the audience.The ""powerful"" elements of the movie are few and far between, bluntening their impact. Also, towards the middle of the film, there seems to be a genuinely scary lack of substance and we get treated to lots of long shots contrasted with close-ups. What this is supposed to tell us, is also a mystery.While the movie must be commended for its treatment of the subject matter and Adrien Brody's excellent performance, it feels more guided rather than directed. Its casual attitude to the violence seems mundane rather than shocking and there is nothing here that Steven Spielberg didn't do better in Schindler's List. Essentially dull, rather than powerful, only the last 45 minutes make this film memorable. 6/10"
CinemaClown,"May 1, 2011",N/A,"Helmed by a Holocaust survivor himself yet presenting an objective take on the disturbing subject matter, The Pianist is the most personal film renowned director Roman Polanski has made in his decades-spanning career for it is crafted with meticulous care n attention, told with immaculate simplicity & also happens to feature one of cinema's most extraordinary performances.Based on the memoir of the same name & set in Warsaw during the Second World War, The Pianist tells the story of Władysław Szpilman; a Polish-Jewish musician who after avoiding deportation to Nazi labour camps tries to elude capture by living in the ruins of his city. The plot details his miraculous survival against all odds which wouldn't have happened without the kindness of few compassionate humans.Directed by Roman Polanski, The Pianist does bring back the horrors of the Holocaust and never shies away from depicting the barbaric treatment millions of Jews underwent during Nazi occupation. But it's not a tale about someone who caused an uprising or put his life on the line to save others but through one person, it tries to capture what most people under same circumstances were trying to do: survive, no matter what it takes.Polanski does manage to infuse his own history into the story but never lets that distract his own vision for the picture at hand, and there in lies the true beauty of this survival story. It's arguably the finest film that he's made & certainly the most artistic. Adding more strength to the feature is the brilliantly-written screenplay that keeps the focus on our protagonist at all times & resonates the brutality that millions underwent through his own life story.Coming to the technical aspects, every single element only ends up enhancing the entire experience. Production Design team does a superb job in recreating the war-torn city & set pieces are refined to smallest of details. Cinematography makes impeccable use of camera in capturing every frame plus the cold colour temperature encapsulates the whole film with a bleak mood. Editing paces its 149 minutes of runtime with precision. And classical music is beautifully incorporated into the narrative.Another thing that seals the destiny of The Pianist is the exceptional performance by Adrien Brody in the role of Władysław Szpilman that simply exceeded every expectation. Perfectly capturing not just the feeling of hopelessness, loneliness, grief & living under constant fear but also the desperation, survival instinct & passion for music, what Brody delivers here is one of cinema's most memorable performances that still ranks as his best and his Academy Award win for this role was deserving in every manner.On an overall scale, The Pianist marks the career high moment for Roman Polanski & Adrien Brody, is an emotionally devastating & powerfully moving cinema that's worthy of all the accolades it has garnered so far, and is amongst the finest examples of historical drama in existence. It certainly isn't going to be an easy sit for most but you'll be a better person for having done because some films, no matter how difficult, deserve to be viewed, and Roman Polanski's magnum opus is definitely one of those cinematic treasures. Strongly recommended."
edwagreen,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"Surprise Oscar winner Adrien Brody is magnificent in Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist."" (It was thought by the experts that Daniel Day Lewis would win the award for ""Gangs of New York."") Polanski's win was a surprise since the conventional wisdom had Martin Scorsese for ""Gangs"" winning the directing award as well.This tremendous holocaust film deals with the destruction of a family. The scene where a family had its wheelchair bound member tossed from a window and then shot as they ran was eerie and never to be forgotten.As a marvelous piano player, Brody captured the role with depth and a strong conviction. The scene where the family is placed on a train for their ultimate destiny can and must never be forgotten as well. From that point on, the focus of the picture becomes one of survival as Brody is able to elude the Nazi barbarians.A strong film in the tradition of ""Schindler's List."" Surely, a film for humanity."
gmj2005,"Feb 20, 2012",10/10,"A true masterpiece of a film, and Adrien Brody is the master actor such as I've never seen before. Until now I'd only seen him in the odd mafia flick, but in this he was sublime. All the actors gave amazing portrayals, but for me Brody stands out perhaps because of the extremes he was required to go to in this role. I'm not sure if Brody is a piano player, if he's not, then he may be the best actor I've ever seen. The viewer becomes invested in the characters of this film, but Brody is our guide through it all, and his character is the most developed of them all in this film. Others were scant where they could have been more full, maybe. The production quality, the settings, dismal depressing & terrifying scenes, all seemed nearly too real, one can easily lose themselves in this movie, immersing so fully it is nearly a shock when the ending comes & one is thrust back into the modern time and body. I had no idea this movie existed until today, nearly 10 years after its release. I watched it on a lark, not expecting anything of this level certainly. Once it began, I was lost to it through the last piano note."
woods-whistling,"Nov 20, 2010",9/10,"This film is an absolute masterpiece and Brody's performance is absolute moving and superb. This film is the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle to survive and escape persecution at the hands of the Nazi invaders in Warsaw.Its a true Roman Polanski classic. A Jewish pianist in Poland caught up in the horrors of World War II. The Nazis invade Poland, confine the Jews to ghettos then ship them off to concentration camps.This an excellent look at the Holocaust through a Jewish man's eyes, but I can see how the violence could be upsetting to some viewers. The violence is heartbreaking and graphic with showing the widespread killing, beating and burning of Jews and others, which can unbearable to watch at times. It's still a very touching and poignant movie and a film that should be seen by everyone."
MxS7HGS,"Dec 2, 2023",9/10,"One of the most exceptional movies about the Holocaust, The Pianist, features an outstanding performance by Adrien Brody, whose nuanced and gaunt portrayal left me speechless and still does so. The movie's impressive set design and passionately acted extras showcase the brutal sufferings of innocent lives in a powerful and purposeful way without resorting to cheap thrills for the audience.Wladyslaw Szpilman was not a hero or a fighter but a survivor whose salvation depended solely on luck. The film's believability and realism stem from its ability to convey this truth. Although the movie can be emotionally draining and heartbreaking, it is worth the sacrifice. The story of the talented Polish pianist is inspiring and serves as a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit."
richardchatten,"Dec 30, 2022",9/10,"Despite the title Adrien Brody doesn't actually get to play the piano much during this film depicting the monstrous institutionalised bullying on an industrial scale that characterised the German occupation of Poland. The second half of the film also largely abandons dialogue for sound effects (what dialogue there is is in German).Growing steadily more gaunt and dishevelled Brody staggers through a Warsaw transformed into a ghost town scattered with corpses while subject to the casual brutality of uniformed thugs who plainly regard it all as a bit of a lark and coping with the hostility of native anti-semites.Director Polanski (90 next August) keeps on going from strength to strength. Originally an actor in the war films of Andrzej Wadja, here he finally addresses head-on the childhood traumas in occupied Poland which obviously lay behind his other films (like Brody the young Polanski was used for target practise by Nazis.When they finally appear the Russians actually get pretty short shift, and considering their recent activities in Ukraine, the observation about the Poles that ""No one thought they'd hold out so long!"" must currently be giving Putin sleepless nights."
eddieluceroHI,"Mar 26, 2023",9/10,"Tear-jerker. Although that dreadful event stands firmly in the background, this movie is really about one man's struggle for survival. The one man is Polish Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman. Adrien Brody played that lead role, and he played it well. Szpilman comes across as both pitiful in his desperation to survive but at the same time as noble in his desperation to survive. Brody portrays him as a man with great dignity. It was a challenging role, because as the movie progresses, there's less and less dialogue for the simple reason that almost everyone except Szpilman has been taken by the Nazis. Brody ends up playing long stretches without voice, but it doesn't stop him from rendering a brilliant portrait of the man, whose friends and family are gone and who simply tries to live day by day hoping for a way out of this madness. Just as haunting are extended scenes in which director Roman Polanski simply shows us a devastated Warsaw - not just the Jewish ghetto, but other parts of the city as well. The scenes of rubble, the scenes of innocent people being gunned down in the street by German soldiers - sometimes just for sport, without any other obvious reason, the scenes of burned out buildings. It's all haunting.For all that - and all that was very good - there was something about the story that didn't really click with me. For some strange reason I found it difficult to follow and I did think that at almost two and a half hours it was a little bit too long."
julialivshits,"Apr 12, 2023",10/10,"This will be the first IMDb rating I'll make as I have more to go, but this is a perfect movie. Adrien Brody's acting is spectacular, and the movie would have been different if someone else played this role. This film was heart-breaking, in which I cried 5 times throughout and then uncontrollably right after. I never cried that hard about a movie before. This movie hits some part of yourself and is a film that would make anyone feel on the inside like you want to crumble and your heart just shatters. I feel like it would be hard to compare this movie to ""Schindler's List"" because although they're both talking in the same time period/era, the plot of each movie don't correlate with each other at all. ""Schindler's List"" talks about Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who saved hundreds of Jews during WWII. (It's been a while since I've seen it but I remember crying so hard my nose bled three times throughout) But then again, The Pianist talks about an individual who lost everything and struggled to stay alive. Moving on, this movie is perfect and deserves a 10/10."
henry8-3,"May 5, 2020",6/10,"Follows a Jewish pianist (Brody) trying to survive in the Warsaw ghetto during WW2.A film broadly of 2 parts, the first covering the arrival of the nazis and its impact on the Jewish community most particularly Brody and his family. This is full of tension brought about the German atrocities and as the family descends further and further into hell. In many ways this is the most harrowing part of the film in that there are so many vulnerable family members to worry about as they move from disbelief and outrage to fear and some form of resignation.The bulk of the film though is a slow but fairly tense passage following Brody hiding and surviving alone in the empty ghetto, his life without food and warmth punctuated by moments of terror.The film is tense and like Schindler's List you do have this dreadful sense throughout of disbelief that this could have happened by people to people. Brody is very good in the lead and overall it is a considerable achievement - important to be sure. I just found that some passages took long to make their point - sorry."
scottrot,"Aug 1, 2003",5/10,"This was a great plot and story line, but the I didn't feel like I knew the main character well enough.  I believe they could have done a much better job with this movie, and I was slightly disappointed.  Since everything surrounded him I feel like his character should have been more developed. The movie is quite slow at times, and I don't think this should be ranked as high as many viewers have ranked it."
tfrizzell,"Apr 11, 2003",N/A,"Haunting adaptation based on the life of Polish Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman (portrayed by surprise Oscar-winner Adrien Brody), a somewhat sheltered young man who just takes life as it comes to him and of course has an uncanny knack for playing the piano. Timing is bad though for the titled character as the Nazi occupation of Poland is imminent and exile to death camps is a definite possibility. Brody and his family (parents Maureen Lipman and Frank Finley and siblings Ed Stoppard, Jessica Kate Meyer and Julia Rayner) quickly realize that things are going from bad to worse as life starts to spin out of control. Instructions in the newspaper foreshadow future hardships as the Star of David patches are demanded of all Jewish peoples to wear and then the dreaded ghettos follow. The film then becomes heart-wrenching, but a change occurs that allows Brody to be spared from the death camps. Now he must try to avoid the Nazi Regime and find an unbending will to survive against all odds. Help does come from fellow Jews and non-Nazi Germans. Emilia Fox makes a lasting impression as a woman that Brody falls in love with early on and then shows up again later in an important part. Thomas Kretschmann also stands out as a Nazi officer who has a change of heart during the film's latter moments (he is also linked to Brody because of his love for the piano). ""The Pianist"" is a film that fashions itself after Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"". This production is better in spots than the earlier movie, but as a whole it is not quite as impressive. ""The Pianist"" has a more exact focus and ends up being more of a one-man showcase for Brody in its second half. ""Cast Away"" meets the Holocaust would probably be the way to describe ""The Pianist"" when all is said and done. A brilliant adapted screenplay by Oscar-winner Ronald Harwood brings the novel to life. Roman Polanski finally struck Oscar gold for his unbelievable direction here (his work is on par with Scorsese's in ""Gangs of New York"" for the most part). He quietly became the oldest winner ever in the Academy's history in that particular category. All the supporters have well-calculated parts, but Brody's character is the most dominant of course. However, Brody never does reach the level of Liam Neeson in ""Schindler's List"" or even past Oscar-winner Roberto Benigni in ""Life Is Beautiful"". In fact his character is not near as complicated as the film would like. He is trying to survive and his motivation is life. A case can be made quite easily for either Daniel Day-Lewis in ""Gangs of New York"" or Jack Nicholson in ""About Schmidt"" to have taken home the Best Actor Oscar instead, but that is in the past now (it is better not to go into Brody's acceptance speech at all). Also Brody did very little playing of the piano himself (he had a double for the much more difficult pieces) which pales him to past Oscar winners like Holly Hunter (""The Piano"") and Geoffrey Rush (""Shine""). Overall I do think ""The Pianist"" is an excellent film. I do think it is one of the stronger screenplay- and direction-driven films of recent memory. Polanski ends up being the real star here and it is his vision, tone, ability and film-making skill that does make ""The Pianist"" one of the best movies of 2002. 5 stars out of 5."
rummanhawaii,"Apr 6, 2023",8/10,"Central to The Pianist is Adrien Brody's portrayal of the title character. It's an incredibly sedate performance, with everything below the surface, utterly commanding of our attention despite its understatement. His emotions seem muted - when reunited with a friend the merest ghost of a smile plays across his lips, but by now we know the character and understand that this is a deep and sincere expression. Brody virtually carries the movie alone, and one of the unfortunate things about The Pianist is that not one other performance stands out at all, and the inadequacy of some of the supporting players does hurt the earlier scenes a little.But perhaps the greatest thing about The Pianist is in the fine construction of its story. Although most of it is based incredibly faithfully on Szpilman's own memoir, the adaptation by Ronald Harwood gives it a certain dramatic course. There is one intensely poignant scene, and one of the few entirely fictionalised episodes, in which Szpilman is being sheltered by Dorota, wakes to the sound of her cello-playing and, just for a moment, he can imagine what life would be like if she had been his wife. Finally, the scene where Hosenfeld asks Szpilman to play for him seems to be the key to the whole thing. It's as if every moment, every narrative line, points towards that scene. We've seen Germans forcing Jews to dance for their entertainment, which makes us first question Hosenfeld's motives. We've seen Szpilman's desperation to be reunited with a piano, his fingers making keystrokes in the air. In retrospect, this all seems a set-up for that encounter. In effect, The Pianist becomes a tale of a harrowing time, filtered through the beauty of a musical performance."

One of the best movies that makes you feel the war and genicode victimization from deep. No comment needed for Adrien Brody. Especially the scenes that comes right after captain met to Szpilman was unforgettable. Movie showing us sad truths in another level. Too hard to choose between 8 or 9.

kaaffilm,"Mar 26, 2023",10/10,"""The Pianist"" (2002) is a powerful, emotional and unforgettable film that tells the true story of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman's survival during World War II. Director Roman Polanski creates an intensely realistic portrayal of the Warsaw Ghetto and the atrocities committed by the Nazi regime, while Adrien Brody gives a mesmerizing performance as Szpilman. The film is a masterful depiction of human resilience and the will to survive in the face of unimaginable horrors.Polanski's attention to detail and commitment to historical accuracy is evident throughout the film, from the realistic sets to the use of period-appropriate costumes and props.

He conveys a range of emotions, from fear and desperation to hope and determination, with subtlety and nuance, earning him a well-deserved Academy Award for Best Actor.""The Pianist"" is a harrowing and deeply moving film that offers a sobering reminder of the atrocities of war and the importance of resilience, hope, and human kindness in the face of unimaginable horrors."
sinam-02161,"Mar 11, 2023",10/10,"This is one of the best War films ever made. Despite Roman Polanski's actions, this film's direction makes you feel like you are part of the world. Truely a piece of art. The movie may not be for everyone, expecially those who are very sensitive to violence and murder. But knowing that everything that happened in this film is true... That's just devistating. The messages to never give up and keep moving forward is amazing. The absolute pointlessness of what the Nazis did is so unsettling. They killed just for killing. The acting in this film is phenominal, from the body language to words spoken. Everyone involved did an amzing jobs with this film. Polanski's actions were wrong, but his directing and storytelling was undeniably great in The Pianist."
Toph-22,"Jan 6, 2021",8/10,"The pianist shows very impressively how people lived respectively suffered at that time. Unimaginable suffering and injustice is done to the people. Life is restricted for no reason. Access to cafes, a visit to the park or sitting on a bench, supposedly self-evident things are forbidden.In retrospect, these restrictions seem almost trivial. The movie shows how the lives of Jewish people gradually become worse and worse. Of course you know where it's going, but that's what gives it even more intensity. Always in the middle, Wladyslaw Szpilman, who tries as far as possible not to attract attention. What other choice do you have if you want to survive. Those who resist or breathe too loudly in the wrong place die. With all his strength and willpower, he lets everything wash over him.Bombing of the immediate neighborhood, up-close shootings and starving people represent everyday life. People are arbitrarily humiliated and harassed. People are grasping at any straw for a bit of hope to get out of this hell alive.The movie does not spare cruelty and shows it consistently. Downplaying would also be the wrong thing to do here. People live in constant fear and you can feel that at all times. The movie primarily follows the lives of the people up close and gives rather little insights into the regime itself. In the ghetto itself, you see how people deal with the events in different ways. Desperation, fear, pure hatred and those who just try not to stand out.Overall, the movie addresses a part of history that must never be forgotten. Of course, you cannot image how bad it really was for the people, but the movie impressively conveys a feeling for it. But through movies of this kind, you always recall these chapters of history in your mind and they make you think about it.Definitely watch it."
raidurgesh,"Jan 7, 2008",10/10,"A realistic phenomenon through the eyes of a pianist to show how tough the world can be? Jew pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman is the best pianist in whole of Poland and goes on to see unimaginable atrocities on him and his family by Germans. The scenes are realistic and the pace of movie is pretty steady but fluent and the whole effect does get upon the viewer. The end part was specially touching. It depicted that we remain the same old good and bad humans and Germans were no different. Probably, it's an excellent way to let the society feel the pain that humans can bring to one another. Adrien Brody has been on his lifetime best and let's all thank Roman Polanski for this creation. The spirit calls for introspections and resolve. We remain humans as long as humanity exists. Let's live up to it. Thanks for all."
BlizzyFoxTF,"Dec 11, 2020",7/10,"A very good war film that depicts the throes of war to a tee, but lacking the nuance that is evident in Spielberg or Cauron's works. Polanski seemed to opt for a less realistic approach in directing this movie, and characters seem more aware that they are in a film than in Schindler's List or Children of Men. In other words, despite the direction being incredibly deft and skillful, it can feel stiff at certain points of the film, and the set pieces artificial and unnatural. The pacing is very well done here, but the fast pace bereaves time for character building. As a result, despite the plethora of violence and moments of despair, they don't land as hard on an emotional level. The side characters/victims are not fleshed out enough, and there's a feel of spectacle for spectacle sake, where scenes play out for an overt intention to fish out visceral reactions. Without ample build up, I find it rather void. There are also quite a few plot contrivances in the film, which point to its main goal of achieving mainstream appeal. The story is decent, and I do not consider it a weak asset despite how simple it is. The protagonist's journey is wild and gripping, but it is not consistently interesting enough to considered very memorable - there aren't quite enough iconic moments or sequences that leaves a profound mark. The reaction between two certain characters at the end of the film could have used a bit more development, especially for one person whom we only come across at the end of the film; a better approach would be to do a dual/ interspersing narrative to introduce that character before that critical scene, such that it holds more weight. Speaking of characters, I feel like there are not enough bad important characters in the film, as opposed to a few good ones that exist. Perhaps it is intentional, with which the film conveys the message that warfare itself is the evil menace while humanity is inherently kind. Still, if there is more contrast presented in certain individuals, those ""noble"" characters would make a bigger impact in both the story and the audience, since it would accentuate the film's ""message"". Lastly, the film's core theme isn't entirely new either. I don't see any new ideas presented in the film other than the cruelty of war, and the struggles of suppressed ethnic groups under tyranny. The protagonist is a lovable character, carried by an amazing performance by Brody, but it is also rather one dimensional that sees little character growth by the end of the film. The Pianist is after all a standard war film, a very well rounded, crowd-pleasing one at that, or at least it feels like one. It does not seem to try achieve much more beyond that.As for the positive aspects, there isn't much that people haven't said already. The cinematography is fantastic, especially the scenes filmed at night. Brody's performance is electrifying and pretty much carries the whole movie. Like I said, the pacing is very well done, and although I find the first hour of the film rather dull, it never feels like it drags at any point, thanks to Polanski's expert direction. The wide appeal of the film means that it is a good recommendation for people who are new to war films. Overall, I don't think it is a 10/10 masterpiece that many hyped it up to be. I think Schindler's List and Children of Men are both far superior films. Yet, it certainly is an enjoyable experience if you are looking for a more palatable war film (there is a fair bit of violence though, so I wouldn't consider it too family friendly)."
cableaddict,"Jun 11, 2004",1/10,"I don't care how important the subject matter is, this film is as boring as anything I've ever seen.Yes, it's a unique twist to view the Nazi-jews situation from this musician's perspective, and yes the cinemetography is excellent.  -But that's all you can say.There's almost no plot.  There are a few very moving scenes, but they are few and far between.There have been SO many superior movies made on basically the samesubject, what is the point of this one?

bob the moo,"Apr 2, 2006",N/A,"Wladyslaw Szpilman is a musician living with his family in 1930's Warsaw. The rise of anti-Semitism starts to erode their civil liberties, making them have permits to work, requiring them to wear armbands that identify them as Jewish and generally treating them like second-class citizens and lesser people. This gradual slide becomes increasingly serious as all Jews are ordered into one small area of the city, where whole families are given flats with one or two small rooms to be shared among six or seven people. As the murders and control of the Jews continue, Szpilman is left to try and survive while the war rages across Europe.I didn't bother to watch this in the cinema despite the Oscars and rave reviews simply because I could never get my head in the right space to spend my time on a subject that was never going to be an easy watch. With it coming onto television recently though I decided it was worth a look and easily got into it, which the emotional power of the story doing enough to carry it along for the duration. At times it does feel like watching war porn, as Polanski wheels out one more shocking atrocity after another and occasionally feels like he is involved in a game of one-upmanship with other Holocaust movies (so we don't just have a man thrown out a window, but a disabled old man thrown out a window). This was a bit of a problem for me because I wanted more to the film that just the horror shown to me. However the film does do more than that and generally does enough to be as impacting in the study of Szpilman as it is in just yet again reminding us of the terrible things done in Europe barely 60 years ago.On both levels the film works while never being something you should try and watch expecting it to be a fun night in. Staying away from the front line of the war, the film focuses on the effects on the innocent, specifically Szpilman, who struggles to just stay alive. Up till this point the film had been a bit obvious, with bad things happening while the Szpilman's argue over what to do etc, with the film relying heavily on the shock and horror of what was happening. The rest of the film is more about him being left alone and hidden within Warsaw, which although slow is still impacting and engaging. At this point Brody also steps up and becomes much better than before, showing so much with just a horrified look but still containing enough of a character to be more than just our eyes. The rest of the cast are all good but generally it is Brody that carries the majority of the film. Polanski directs with a very good eye for the breakdown of this world and it looks totally of period and convincing.Overall then, not a film to come to if you are hoping for a cheerful night in but one to watch to gain a wider appreciation of the atrocities that can so easily be allowed to take place. Ethnic cleansing and wars continue even as I sit writing these words so those that think this film is just an unnecessary wallow in past horrors would do well to take a minute and think. At times it could have been better but it is impossible to ignore the power of the story and the impact of the delivery."
everestfinale,"Mar 12, 2023",10/10,"The natures of a Pianist, are more vivid In this society than thought to be known. Although the strong emotions that this FILM shows can be overpowering and shroud the character past the imagination, one can see the importance to this. This shows the viewer something that history class can't, it shows the Raw complexity and the horrific state that Poland was in during the holocaust. One thing that can definitely be grasped by watching this film, is that although a strong, emotional and confident film. There is a even distribution of complexity and balance to what some may say, a periodic stage of change in mind. This film leaves you lying awake at night thinking about what you would of done or what life for your family would of Been like, and to me to be able to put my self into that position and be able the vividly imagine my departure from this world and or my family is something that I will never forget. That is why this film is the greatest movie of all time."

neokatsapas,"Jan 17, 2021",8/10,"The best thing about The Pianist is a few key moments, which are, in my opinion, some of the most powerful, and best scenes of all time. Some of the images shown here, and what they imply, are just so incredibly horrific and depressing that I can't get them out of my head. This is not only because of what they're actually showing, but also because of the very realistic and grounded way they're presented; most are captured in a single long take and a lot of these sequences aren't shown in detail as they're shot from a distance. At times absolutely nothing is even shown, and instead a single sound effect can be incredibly powerful.Despite a few specific key moments standing out, that's not to say that the rest of the runtime is uninteresting. The plot is unpredictable at every turn and the script isn't afraid to kill off lead characters. There are also many moments with absolutely no dialogue and complete silence were the minor mannerisms in the characters carry the scene, which is elevated by the absolutely excellent performances. The story takes place over a long period of time and the protagonist ends up in many different locations; the way in which he ends up in all these areas though, is very rarely shown. He'll often be somewhere, for example a concentration camp, planning to escape, then the scene would immediately cut to him outside of it, not telling you how he got there until a few minutes later when it's mentioned in a conversation. This is a very unique way to pace a film, and it mostly pays off; I really like that you have to play close attention to follow every plot point and that the script doesn't hold your hand or spoon-feed you. On the other hand however, this does mean that some elements of the story do end up feeling a bit rushed and underdeveloped in the second half as some plot points go by so quickly that it's hard to get attached to them. It is definitely impressive though that despite this film being an entire two and a half hours long, my biggest issue with it is that I wanted it to be longer, as it's really never boring.Roman Polanski may not be the best person, at all, but his work on this film is undeniably excellent. There are plenty of extremely impressive long takes and the direction is fantastic, managing to change from a close up, to a wide, to an over the shoulder in a single shot, without you even realizing. The cinematography really makes you feel as trapped as the lead character and the production and costume design are also absolutely flawless, perfectly presenting the time period. The choice to barely use any music throughout the entire runtime built tension very well and stopped any scene from becoming overly melodramatic. The technical aspects of this film are mostly stellar, the only two exceptions being one otherwise amazing scene with somewhat cheesy sound effects and a very strong overabundance of fade to black transitions, which got really annoying after a while.Overall, The Pianist has some of the best scenes in film history and, despite a few flaws, is one of the most powerful movies I've ever seen."
ated-33034,"Sep 7, 2021",8/10,"Very good movie. Very sad, Brody turns in a great performance."
ronakkotian,"Sep 11, 2020",10/10,"There have been some great Holocaust films made in the past such as Schindler's List but what Roman Polanski, Ronald Harwood and Adrien Brody brought to The Pianist make it one of the best Holocaust films ever made.The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Jewish piano player, who tries to survive in the Polish ghetto during the Holocaust.There are very few films that leave me speechless by the end of it and The Pianist is no different. I remember just sitting as the credits rolled and thinking how lucky I was avoid such a brutal and inhumane period of time. The way Roman Polanksi directed this film is absolutely excellent. This is a very emotional experience that will bring you on the verge of tears because of how sad it is. Polanksi shows Nazi occupied Poland in such a brilliant way. I loved the ugly colour palette this film had as it reinforced how dark and depressing it was during that time. The way innocent people were shot for the smallest of things also showed the ruthless nature of the Germans and how difficult it was to survive. There is an absolutely fantastic shot at the end showing a whole row of destroyed buildings where I couldn't believe how cruel humanity was.I remember seeing Adrien Brody in films and TV shows like King Kong and Peaky Blinders but his performance in The Pianist is truly mesmerising. It's no surprise that he won an Oscar for it. I don't think I've ever felt this sympathetic towards a character in a film for a long time. Brody captures the helplessness and vulnerability of Szpilman perfectly. I cared for him all the way and really wanted him to survive and it's mainly because of the range of emotion Adrien Brody is able to bring in his performance that I was able to do that.The Pianist is one of the greatest Holocaust films I've seen. It shows Nazi occupied Poland in a very honest and realistic way without sugarcoating any of it and conveys the struggle a Jewish man goes through as heartbreaking as possible. It's a definite must watch!"
colebt33-780-179547,"Sep 25, 2010",9/10,"They say that the best story you can tell is a true story, and considering World War 2 is one of the greatest historic devastations of man kind, you can understand why there have been so many instalments about this tragic, dark time in human society. Until now, I always thought 'Schindler's List' (by Steven Spielberg) to be the best of the WWII films, but then I came across 'The Pianist', directed by the highly acclaimed Roman Polanksi. The creator of 'Chinatown' and 'Rosemary's Baby' has truly out done himself with this incredibly powerful, visually compelling piece about the Jewish ghetto in Warshaw.The Pianist follows the story of piano player Wlad Spielzman and his constant struggle for survival in the German occupied city of Warshaw, which I have already mentioned. What started out as few new rules (the wearing of arm bands, the saluting of passing German officers on the sidewalk), became a vast series of evacuation orders, transporting, herding, and holding Jewish people as if they were animals. After managing to escape the latest ship out, Spielzman flees to the dead, empty roads and streets of Warshaw, living off only the kindness of strangers.One of the great things about this movie is that the main lead is neither a hero, or a blood thirsty rebel our for revenge, he's an ordinary man who's just trying to stay alive. This I think allows the viewers to really relate to him in some way, making them really care about what happens to him as he wanders the streets of Warshaw desperately look for means of support, food and shelter. It also adds a sense of realism, because when I think about it, if I was in that same position, which I'm very thankful that I wasn't, I wouldn't speak out, or stand up against those who clearly have the power over my life. I would remain silent and still, because under these conditions, being brave is just another word for being stupid.Adrien Brody's portrayal of a man who had his freedom, his livelihood, almost his whole life stolen away from him is so heart- breaking to watch, I'm very glad that he received an Academy Award for that performance (I was a little surprised when I found out that Adrien was the youngest person ever to receive an Academy Award, I mean 27 isn't that young is it?) Roman Polanksi's images of war do not focus as much on the spilling of blood as you may see in other modern war movies, however there were a few scenes of grittiness that added some dramatic effect. I personally enjoyed the pointless shooting of Jewish randoms, where they line up every marching Jew and take a bullet to the heads of a selection of those unlucky bunch. Steven Spielberg showed the same thing in ""Schindler's List"" and it had a considerably powerful essence to it. But back to my earlier point. ""The Pianist"" does not focus on bloody, visually enhanced images of war, but rather on the depriving treatment of the Jewish community. The insulting of not being able to sit on public benches, the demeaning humiliation forced by German soldiers for amusement, all add to the heartbreaking sense of helplessness which also creates more dramatic effect.One of my most favourite parts of the movie is the end, or close to it anyway. The scene when the German soldier finds Spielzman in an abandoned house trying to open a can of pickles. After explaining his story and finding out that he is a pianist the soldier asks him to play something, just at top of his head. After a considerably long silence and a beautiful piano solo, the soldier spares his life and hides him in the attic, secretly supplying bread and jam to him. The most enjoyable thing about this scene is that it really reflects the symbolism of the pianist's extraordinary musical gift, because in a dark time such as this, music is the only pure thing that still remains, and in the end it is the thing that saves the pianist's life.This is arguably the greatest of the WWII films. It's intelligent direction and efficiently powerful images are very hard to match and Adrien Brody made history with his wonderful portrayal of the deeply effecting piano player, Wlad Spielzman."
frankwiener,"Jul 3, 2024",9/10,"Unlike many other reviewers, I will not compare this film to ""Schindler's List"". Although both films take place during the same era and are based on the same European Holocaust that occurred at the time, they are very different products with their own, unique perspectives and emphases. Each one is to be valued in its own right. Each one stands alone in its importance.Director Roman Polanski escaped from the Jewish ghetto of Krakow, Poland during World War II when the Nazis invaded his country. My mother and my maternal grandparents were born within an hour's drive from Krakow but were fortunate to leave Poland for the United States before the war. They caught the last boat out and landed in New York on Black Monday, October 28, 1929. After that date, it would have been impossible for them to leave Poland before the Germans invaded ten years later in 1939. Most of my grandfather's family remained in that area of southern Poland and were never heard from again after the invasion. Although centered in Warsaw, this film allowed me a glimpse of the brutality that my own family members certainly experienced in Poland during the war.Perhaps because of the personal connection, I found myself periodically turning the movie off in order to rest from its overwhelming intensity. There were times when I actually couldn't even breathe as I watched, undergoing a mixture of very strong feelings including anger, rage, sadness, disgust, and horror. If I experienced this reaction merely from watching the events unfold on a screen, how did the actual victims of such horrific violence and degradation feel as they actually lived through it?I commend Mr. Polanski for his very skillful and meticulous efforts in recreating the traumatic ordeal that he himself managed to survive. Among other dire conditions, the constant need for fundamental food, water, warmth, and sleep was very successfully conveyed from start to finish. I had already been a Polanski fan from ""Rosemary's Baby"" and ""Chinatown"", among his other works, but now my admiration for his brilliance is sealed.Although the entire cast is excellent, the outstanding work of Adrien Brody as Wladislaw Szpilman, the pianist whose memoirs served as a basis for the film, was appropriately acknowledged with his Oscar as best actor. Like Polanski was in real life, he is forced into the role of powerless observer as he directly witnesses the worst atrocities imaginable. He plays the part perfectly, and his very expressive face, which does not always require words, surely helps him to accomplish the task at hand. Brody's highly controlled emotions do not explode until he sees his entire family being boarded onto the boxcar. Instinctively, he knows that he will never see any of them ever again as he wanders in a state of complete confusion and despair through the dangerous and deadly streets of Warsaw. Among all of the superb cast members, Thomas Kretschmann must also be recognized for his noteworthy performance as the German officer who spares Szpilman's life in appreciation of his talent as a musician.Aside from Kretschmann's character, Polanski was determined to recognize the noble and courageous efforts of non-Jewish Poles and Germans who risked their very lives and those of their families in order to save their fellow human beings. Again, this is based on Polanski's own, direct experience during the war. For all I know, one of the rural villages where Polanski found refuge could have been my own grandmother's tiny hamlet in the Carpathian foothills, not far from Krakow.What is most shocking and disturbing to me is how easy it is for a political regime, such as the Nazis in Germany during World War II, to dehumanize and humiliate an entire segment of the population, in this case a very sizeable one. After seeing this film, perhaps we can begin treating each other with the basic decency and respect that we deserve in spite of any differences that may divide us. Is it possible?"
Morejambo54,"Aug 20, 2021",7/10,"First off...what an amazing start this movie has. The beginning is so absolutely terrifying and saddening to watch. It is incredibly tense with an awful atmosphere perfectly built for this kind of movie. It also doesn't refrain from showing violence which makes you want to look away from how brutal it is. All this, with the amazing acting and amazing soundtrack, create for a very depressing film. Also the cinematography is excellent. I do find that the middle Chunk of the movie, wasn't all that great...and I find it really hard to say anything negative on a movie about such a touching subject, but as solely a film stand point. The middle section is extremely repetitive and slow which ends up making it quite boring. The climax does turn it around but only very last minute, still a great ending though. I do think movies like this are extremely important, especially for the younger generations (including myself). There is a lot in this movie that can teach people which is brilliant."
sebastian-pupillo,"Jun 8, 2005",2/10,"I went to see this movie with pretty high expectations. Polanski has quite a reputation. I felt the film was dull, lacked artistic imagination and its trite presentation of history really disappointing. Apart from the scene with the suitcases, I found the whole thing banal, way too heavy handed and very clichéd. If you are interested in the subject of the film, I recommend you read the following couple of pages from a memoir of the son of a Holocaust survivor at the web address below.

streabbog,"Aug 26, 2006",N/A,"How did Adrien Brody win best actor when he couldn't even convincingly ""fake play"" the piano? Every time he sat down at the piano, I rolled my eyes and felt so embarrassed for him: here goes again the utterly ridiculous head sways and the faulty positioning of the hands on the keyboard! The scene in which he plays for the Nazi guy was the most hilarious: The Nazi is supposed to be ""inspired"" and ""touched"" by his playing, but because Brody looks so awful, all one can think about is how truly awful it must have sounded while filming; there was no suspension of disbelief. Brody has been awarded for FAILING--that's totally unfair! If you want a truly inspiring and believable performance, then watch ""Shine"". Geoffrey Rush does a spectacular job at pseudo-playing the piano--he won't make you cringe or laugh in embarrassment."
KnightsofNi11,"Mar 14, 2011",8/10,"It takes a lot of guts to make a film about arguably the most tragic event in human history. The director must put the film together with care and respect towards those depicted in the film. The writer must pay attention to the details of the events and bring them across in the most respectful nature without exploiting the events for cinematic gain. The actors must have the utmost care for the characters they portray in order to properly tell such a tragic story. Roman Polanski's The Pianist hits all these marks. The film is adapted from the memoirs of a famed Polish Jewish pianist named Wladyslaw Szpilman. It chronicles the events of the Jewish exile into the Polish ghettos and their eventual relocation to the concentration camps. Szpilman, however, was not taken to a concentration camp and had to spend months hiding out from the Germans as they destroyed Warsaw, Poland. It is a very difficult story to portray, as well as watch, making it a harrowing yet memorable piece of art.I would never have known you could make such a despicable event such as this into such a glorious work of art. But Roman Polanski does it. He directs this film with such gracious beauty that shocks and mystifies the viewer. It is a film you can't take your eyes off of, no matter how much you want to. It is strange to call this such a beautiful film, but it is. It isn't beautiful in the sense that we often associate beauty with. It is beautiful in its portrayal of such tragic events through such a subtle and meticulous lens. Polanski directs every bit of this film with the utmost respect towards the subject matter. He stays so far away from making this an exploitation film and instead makes into into a work of art where the tragedy we witness on screen is almost hypnotic in its depiction.And to add to the emotional brilliance of this film, Adrien Brody does a fantastic job as Szpilman. His portrayal earned him an Academy Award for best actor and it's not difficult to realize why. He goes through such an dramatic transformation throughout this film, both physical and mental. He begins as an esteemed Polish pianist who is very likable and very homely. He has a loving family and a great career. But as the destruction of Warsaw caves in around him, so does his whole life. When he is separated from his family he must look after nobody but himself. It is very difficult to watch his tragic physical and mental deterioration. You think he's lost it all until the end of the film when you realize just how much he retains. Szpilman is not a pianist just to add a different kind of aspect to the film. He is a pianist because this supports the entire idea of the film. He shows just how important music and art is to the world, even in such tragic times. His ability to play the piano so well saves his life, as well as renews it. It is a fascinating thing to think about, even though it is something very subtle in the film.All this being said, The Pianist didn't strike as many emotional chords with me as I thought it would. I'm not sure why, but I was more mystified with the quality of the film, rather than emotionally moved by the events. They are undoubtedly tragic and still difficult to watch, but I didn't feel a lot of emotion boiling up inside of me while watching this film. I only felt a sincere amazement by how well the film was put together and how great Adrien Brody was. I am in no way saying this isn't an emotional film, but it just wasn't as striking to me as it would be to other people. I feel like more could have been done with this film, but at the same time I feel like there was just enough in this film to give it its consistent subtle beauty. I wasn't quite as drawn in by this film as I thought I would be, but it is undoubtedly excellent.The Pianist is a beautiful film. I wasn't moved by it enough for it to earn a spot in one of my all time favorite films, but it is a film experience I will never forget. I will always remember just how well constructed this story was and how successfully beautiful of a film it was. This is an unforgettable film that shows what dramatic historical filmmaking is all about."

yungnoclout,"Apr 20, 2020",10/10,"This is arguably the best Holocaust film ever made, second only to Schindler's List in my opinion - however they are quite different films, so I can see this being debatable as to which is the best. The Pianist follows Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew hiding from apartment to apartment within the heart of Germany. This is rather unique for Holocaust films since most Holocaust films take place within the concentration camps, but this film doesn't have a single scene in one.Adrien Brody's performance is genuinely one of the best I've ever seen, seeing his body deteriorate on screen is difficult to watch as he struggles to survive, but makes it all the more immersive. The production design and sets are perfect in my opinion and also play a huge role in immersing the audience, I really felt as if I was in the heart of Nazi Germany watching this film. The direction and cinematography might be boring for some but I really loved Polanski's use of perspective in this film, many shots are set up from the perspective of Szpilman looking out his apartment window as gunfights occur down on the streets which I thought was a great artistic choice.I can't recommend this film enough, it's a must watch."

I don't think you can really finish this movie and not feel sorry for him. The last scenes with his family are so poignant, with just a few lines of dialogue, the director touched on the essence of saying good bye. His love of music, and not being able to play personally touches the audience. As music is his life and passion, not exercising that talent only drives sorrow to the extreme-degree. The look throughout all the scenes of the film express the dread of his character so clearly: the look of holding back tears and not giving up. This only adds to his dignity as someone trying to survive and bring the humanity out of others."
khalidmoubile,"Aug 17, 2023",8/10,"The Pianist.A Polish Jewish musician struggles to survive the destruction of the Warsaw ghetto of World War II.The pianist is a biopic about a Jewish musician who straggled during the second world war with more 500 thousands polish jew, so it was hard to watch everything they've been through, however the story is worth telling, the story of the pianist.Polanski did a great job, picturing that era in the realest of ways... And that famous scene with Adrian Brody crying and walakin alone in the street was perfectly made.Talking now about the best thing about the movie, Brody did the performance of a lifetime here, a very Oscar worthy performance of one of the best actors of his generation ."
Messi_The_Messiah,"Nov 6, 2008",10/10,"All you see these days are mainstream films that were made for 2 things, entertainment and money. It seems that Hollywood has ran out of ideas in making a beautiful film that will stay in your mind,forever.The Pianist is not just a movie, it is an experience.The Pianist is a story about a young Jewish musician named Wladyslaw Szpilman,a brilliant pianist and composer,probably the most acclaimed of his time until the World War II made him give up his career.This powerful,triumphant film will leave you breathless.It follows Szpilman's journey for survival during the Holocaust with the help of a sympathetic Nazi Officer.He lost his family and was separated from his friends but that made him stronger.Survival was his masterpiece.It is both depressing and uplifting.The film was nominated for 7 Oscar in 2003 and won 3 including Best Actor for Adrien Brody's greatest performance is his career.I haven't seen Schindler's List before, but this film might be the greatest Holocaust film ever made.Bravo to Roman Polanski.This is what artistic film should be like!!!"
Nishva,"Aug 12, 2025",10/10,"The Pianist is a haunting and deeply moving portrayal of survival amid the horrors of World War II. Adrien Brody delivers a career-defining performance as Wadysaw Szpilman, a gifted Polish pianist whose life is shattered by the Nazi invasion. Roman Polanski's restrained yet powerful direction captures both the brutality of war and the quiet resilience of the human spirit. With its raw realism, emotional depth, and unforgettable imagery, this is a poignant testament to endurance, art, and hope in the face of unimaginable despair."
reidhardi,"Jun 24, 2013",10/10,"Perhaps my ""Summary"" is a joke because I have only seen 3 of Polanski's movies. Chinatown (9 out of 10) and Rosemary's Baby (7 out of 10) But The Pianist might as well be my favorite whether I have seen many of his films are not, for The Pianist is truly excellent. Sad but never boring or pretentious. Polanski seems to be a fan of bad (upsetting)endings so that left me worried to watch the end. I will not spoil it but watch every minute of this movie. Brody got the Oscar that he truly deserved and the film deserved Best Picture over Chicago, LOTR: Two Towers, was in the race so I choose that over this. I just cannot wait to own this movie."
MrskiViletic,"Apr 4, 2019",10/10,"A movie that depicts the impact of war on civilians and the strength of the human spirit in a situation that seems to get more and more hopeless over time. Masterfully directed by Roman Polanski, ""The Pianist"" shows how the unwillingness to act by world leaders to protect the downtrodden can lead to unimaginable catastrophe. A cautionary tale of war and conflict, and the utter destruction that they bring with them."
MovieAddict2016,"Nov 3, 2004",7/10,"Although I found ""The Pianist"" to be a commendable and fairly well-made effort, I did not find it to be a masterpiece. It certainly has the ""feel"" of an epic but compared to other WWII/Jewish movies (particularly ""Schindler's List"") it fails.I was shocked to see that the film had generated some fairly bad reviews on RottenTomatoes.com. I can understand where these authors are coming from -- ""The Pianist"" is a fine movie but uneven and not as great as it seems to think it is.At best I can compliment the good parts because some of them really are touching, but more often than not it's just too purposely sentimental to warm up to -- I never thought I'd say this but even Spielberg's version was less sugar-coated!Don't get me wrong, it's not glamorized and there are some brutal deaths, but it's just a bit too black-and-white and emotionally controlling for me to call it a masterpiece.3/5"
vladymirror,"Aug 29, 2003",N/A,"This is going to be a difficult review as difficult and disturbing the movie ""The Pianist"" was. Even though our world is saturated with crime and violence I still had close my eyes for some of the scenes in this movie. At one point I thought that it was too much. I have seen many, many movies about the WW2, but a have never seen violence in such a blunt way. One has to be in a lot of pain to be able to make such a movie, which is pretty much the case with Mr. Polanski.The movie tells the true story of a man who survives the holocaust by pure chance, luck, stoicism, and the good will of few good people. Or maybe everything was just a fate. Don't expect to see a hero or fighter kind of story. No, he is just a man fighting for his own survival. This is not a thriller.I knew that there would be a scene where the pianist is supposed to play for a German solder so I was looking forward to seeing it. I wanted to see the direction of the scene, the acting of them both (the pianist and the officer), and of course, hear the music. Well, it was a breathtaking experience. See it for yourselfP.S. At the end I think that the Russians a very much in debt to that genre-movies dealing with the WW2. They used to make such a great movies about the war, but not anymore. I think it is about time to see a high budget Russian WW2 movie, a film about those who carried out the entire war on their shoulders."
eireendonegal,"Sep 12, 2019",10/10,"I think it is the best film I have ever watched. It is something everybody should watch, not only for artistic, but also educational reasons. The film raises awareness about all the cruelty and crimes commited in the WWII. After watching it, I don't think that anyone could deny the Holocaust and all the tortute that Jews suffered."
Sude-87,"Jul 26, 2025",10/10,"That film is two years older than me. For years, I had heard its name-sometimes with curiosity, sometimes with indifference. But finally-yesterday, encouraged by watching Oppenheimer-I was able to watch it today. It exceeded my expectations, even though, to be honest, I wasn't quite sure what I was expecting.The film tells the story of Jews persecuted by the Nazis in Poland during World War II, from the perspective of Wladek, who comes from a Jewish family.It shows just how terrifying war is-or rather, what genocide truly means. It depicts how people were murdered for no reason and how some even took pleasure in committing these atrocities. I watched many scenes thinking, ""This can't be real.""The fact that people actually lived through this-and that the rest of the world remained indifferent-is heartbreaking. And, sadly, it's something we still see today.The Pianist became one of the films I deeply appreciated and watched with intense emotion. There were many moments when my eyes filled with tears. I regret not watching it sooner. It truly deserved all the awards and praise it received."

FLASHP01NT,"Jan 31, 2019",8/10,"Succinct and too the point: The Pianist (2002), staring Adrien Brody, as the real life Wladyslaw Szpilman (a Jewish radio station pianist), spotlights the brutal efficiency of WWII state-sponsored genocide in Nazi occupied Poland (1939-1945).Roman Polansky's direction still feels smooth and fresh, even in 2002. Polansky has embraced the neo-noir style more than any other modern director and it's poignancy has resulted in the pinnacle film of his career. Polansky also relies on the actors to instruct the audience as to what is important and why. Brody's face carries the audience through the war, and, by the end of the film, you feel like you've been liberated too."

DrAwesomeness,"Oct 4, 2013",9/10,"It is a few years since I saw this movie in the cinema and I remembered how powerful I thought it was. Well at the second viewing on DVD it was still as powerful and haunting - however I say this with a great deal of respect to Polanski - I will never watch this movie again.You know the feeling you have when you just had an awful day at work, had some horrible news from a friend and there is reports about a natural disaster that have devastated the life of thousands on the news. All you want to do is get a bit of escape from reality with a nice movie in the evening. A word of advice - Do not watch the Pianist.Yes is is a masterpiece - but oh so depressing. If however you are in need of some historical realism and a good cry - well I did warn you.This movie made me realize that I like comedies...."
durf,"Jun 29, 2003",6/10,"""The Pianist"" is a good movie in every way - acting, photography, directing, whatever. But in the end it is just another Holocaust movie. Tormented Jews, German cruelties, a kind Nazi, all the usual stuff. It breaks no new ground, offers no new insights. If I'd seen the movie 30 years ago I would have given it 10, but I have to stretch today to give ""The Pianist"" a 6. I've seen many movies exactly like it."
Kdosda_Hegen,"May 14, 2020",4/10,I've seen many ww2 movies and this one's nothing special at all. In fact it's long and it feels.
SynRQ,"Jun 25, 2024",10/10,"The Pianist is a great film and shares a similar space with Schindler's List in war movies. Adrien Brody does a great job in expressing the struggles of losing loved ones/friends to undeserved violence and living in poor quality conditions, with his body deteriorating as the war continued. The supporting actors are great as well and really tie up the family unit nicely. It is their great portrayals that make it all the more depressing when they are stripped from him and he is thrust into minimal contact of any value. My favorite aspect of the film would have to be the sets. They are well crafted and create a gloomy and hollow atmosphere that starts with warm colors but fade into cool tones. I also think the sets have a slight ""theater/play"" aesthetic that makes it distinct from other war films. This film is a testament to enduring the harsh hands of man and unfair choices but ends in the warmth of a new life. This film makes for a wonderful headstone of a man that has deserved his day of play."
firoz-fin,"Mar 3, 2015",10/10,"The Pianist is a really an awesome movie. Its all concept and story is magnificent. This movie help us to remember about the murders of Jews by Hitler.This type of movie is so much needed for the next generation. The Pianist helps them to remember the past. And it is a great achievement for the next generation. We want this type of movie more and more. I also thanks the hero and the director of the movie and the all characters who make the movie more real. This all characters are really important to make the movie more real. We expect from the director to get such type of movies more and more. It is not just only a movie, it is a reality of the Jews."
MickyG333,"Oct 14, 2025",8/10,"8.0 stars.It's impressive that the film is from his perspective, so we get a glimpse of what it might have been like for a pianist during the war, working in camps, suffering, starving, trying to escape. He lost hope many times, but we get to witness that even hope is irrelevant when one is being so cruelly treated as this. People are lined up randomly and ended on the spot, he's one of many who gets lucky and isn't picked for termination. He is gifted as a pianist which at first is his saving grace, but after a while it doesn't matter who you are, they will eliminate you at the drop of a hat, by the flip of a coin. I don't know if circumstances were truly like that, but if so, what a nightmare. Eventually he starts to feel emotions again. It's really quite the experience watching 'The Pianist'. In many ways this film is brilliant and superior, but it's also a dose or reality that I'd rather not have to ponder. If this is something that humans are actually capable of doing to each other, I'm ashamed of the human race. What a travesty, but such a great story and I've gained a new perspective on life because of 'The Pianist'."
sexyladyjen,"Aug 1, 2024",10/10,"I saw this movie mainly because I play the piano and wanted to see whats going on. It was 1am when it started and wanted to see just few mins. I ended up 4am whith my mind full of thoughts. This is the most raw movie Ive ever seen. Very realistic and raw scenes and script that describes the Nazi invasion very accurate. Very hard to watch film, especialy for more sensitive people. I personaly dont get sensitive with movies and I handle violence scenes , but this is not about violence, its about war rawness and unbelievable documents. (Dead kids rotting on roads, Nazi killing random people, execution , etc.) Amazing acting , music and director. Also heard iconic Chopin pieces, but notice that the film isn't about the piano but about the pianist."
JoakzUy,"Oct 27, 2025",10/10,"A great film starring Adrien Brody, which tells the story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a skilled Polish Jewish pianist who must survive the Holocaust, living in hiding for years and escaping Nazi persecution.The film is incredible; it tells the story of a man whose entire life is crumbling, and shows us all the difficult situations he had to endure to survive. And as an even more incredible detail, the film is based on true events. I highly recommend it."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Feb 27, 2008",9/10,"""The Pianist"" is a film that is impossible to dislike. In fact, it may be impossible to love it as well. It's a traumatic and difficult biographical account of one of the many unbelievable Holocaust survival stories. What makes ""Pianist"" stand out, however is the traumatic realism, the way that the story evolves to strike an emotional chord in regards to the Nazi's crimes and the unique role of music in the film.""The Pianist"" is the Oscar-winning best adapted screenplay from the autobiography of Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody), an accomplished Jewish pianist in Warsaw right as World War II strikes. The film plays out as several scenes following a timeline from the initial invasion to the Warsaw ghetto to Szpilman's many hideouts in the city throughout the war. While the true sense of time is skewed and thus the true agony of Szpilman's isolation unrealized, the timeline clearly shows how the Jews and everyone in Warsaw for that matter had their lives transformed.What makes this film so effective is the way Oscar winners Ronald Harwood (screenplay), but mostly director Roman Polanski, go right for your heartstrings. The Nazis are portrayed as cold-blooded killers. There is no emotional build-up or excessive suspense in the film's violent moments. It is sudden and mechanical, leaving you wondering how anyone could do such a thing, when the fact of the matter was that's exactly how it happened: many times arbitrary, heartless killing. The whole effect that Polanski has created with the violence being viewed by Szpilman and his family through windows, isolated from the mêlée, is very effective in the way that it connects with how the viewer is very much isolated from the true nature of the violence. Polanski conditions you to be afraid every time Szpilman looks out the window that violence might occur, which is exactly what Szpilman was: very curious about what was going on, but truly afraid. The effect is brilliant.The films third Oscar winner, Brody, doesn't give an emotionally moving performance per say, but his performance is award-worthy in its realism through exquisite use of non-verbal skills and his natural demeanor. You can tell how the war has transformed him as a person through each stage--from day one to the final moments of the film.If there's a weakness to the film, it's the fact that it doesn't spend enough time grasping Szpilman as a pianist. There is no sense as to how important his playing is or why he plays. Instead, the focus is more on the unfolding the events of WWII. While the idea the film presents of him being a pianist simply because that's what he knows to do is effective towards the end, a greater understanding of what playing the piano means to him would have been ideal in the beginning.""The Pianist"" is a tremendous achievement in terms of successfully telling a often repeated story in a way that is uniquely effective. It focuses on the aspect of the Holocaust that speaks to perseverance, basic survival in a life of fear that plays out outside your window. It is a tough film, but it's a good one."
ashray-srt,"Mar 16, 2015",10/10,"this movie touched my heart in every frame.Shows us all what is the real meaning of struggling,surviving and mighty life.wow i sometimes wonder what is that we don't have that makes us unhappy when many out there having nothing and no reason live but still struggles to live.This movie shows us how barbaric the human race can be and how resilient a human can be.the director of the movie should be given more credits for bringing such a harsh,heart wrenching truth to the screen in manner that touches people across the planet irrespective of race,religion and all other non senses.Acting,what to speak lead actor totally deserves his Oscar.He makes cry and feel his pain.Coming to the ending,my word its really beautiful.Man running out to hug an other human after all he went though tells something about life."

Yes, even if you think it's cruel, it's a little too clean and beautiful. But I still like this movie very much. As long as those warm things are there, it's OK. Although the war is actually much crueler."
RedRidz,"Aug 28, 2012",9/10,"What a fabulous movie! Very very touching and realistic. One of Adolf Hitler's first major foreign policy initiatives after coming to power was to sign a nonaggression pact with Poland in January 1934. Poland had received the former German provinces of West Prussia, Poznan, and Upper Silesia under the Treaty of Versailles after World War I. Britain and France deployed their force in poland. However, neither Britain nor France in 1938 was militarily prepared to fight a war against Nazi Germany.During that time, people were in exigency and crisis. This film shows that exact situation. People were inconsequential. I saw how people endured the situation, how they were killed by Nazies .Certainly I'm going to give this credit to Roman Polanski and Ronald Harwood for making this film so realistic. Haven't seen such a worst situation before this. What is crisis? You will come to know after watching this film. This film shows exactly how it was in real.A poor hungry old man threw a bowl of food from being eaten by a poor woman. The poor old man licked the road in order to eat the food that came out of the bowl. The man was deranged though. This one is my best part of this movie. Another best part is, a young boy was selling caramel for 20 zlotys. A caramel for 20 zlotys! Can you believe this? Situation materialized it. Wladyslaw's father intended to buy a caramel. However, he had only 10 zlotys. So he collected other 10 from others around him. Worse part is, he divided the caramel into 6 pieces and distributed to other members of his family. Very very pathetic and regretful. There are so many tremendous moments that touched my heart but I can't mention them all simultaneously.I'm impressed seeing the survive of Wladyslaw.Every film doesn't have a great ending, nevertheless this film has a great ending! Of course the Nazies were vanquished in the end."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Feb 2, 2020",10/10,"Honestly, I can't decide what's more heartrending and devastating: the agonies of the Jews, or the fact that Brody is one of the most wasted talents ever! A Roman Polanski masterpiece, the movie that should have won best picture instead of that lousy musical. A heartbreaking film completed with a haunting and heartbreaking performance by Adrien Brody. This film just takes your heart and crushes it to pieces. , A true masterpiece, Brody has earned my respect, 10/10"
gufi-04429,"May 26, 2019",8/10,"The movie is quite simple, but I think that that exactly simplicity made most of the scenes so heartbreaking and overwhelming. There was no filter, just raw and real truth of what jewish people had to go through during WW2. The movie showed desperation, hope, need for survival. Some moments were so heavy that I was not even able to cry, I just simply suffered wathing the main character's misery. Another thing I noticed, and liked, in the film is that some Nazis (specially Captain Hosenfeld) were presented in a positive way that I have not seen in any movie about the WW2 before, it just proves that some of them contained humanity. Also, needless to say but I will say it anyway, the acting game was at a spectacular level. Overall, I think this was a very powerful and distressing documentary not only about one pianist's survival but a story about a whole dark and disturbing era of the human history. Like I said, very heartbreaking movie but definitely a worth watching one."
Sanou_san,"Jun 28, 2012",10/10,"Had to be top achievement of Adrien Brody, and I never doubt the pinnacle of his performance for this. Set again the old ages of the 20th century this film made me recall Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" ringing in my head. It was as heartrending, fearful, expressive and disastrous as the characters of Spielberg's film experienced, though in a different view of course. This film again showed us the misery of innocent people experienced in the hands of vile Germany. But then it left me a room to think in my head that not everything of Germany is as vile as the mainstream thinks. It's the same lesson I picked when watching Schindler's List. And the suffering of the protagonist opened once more parts of life you never thought would happen to anyone. And there are so many things you would never thought of letting go or letting it happen before your eyes and conscience. Such burden and misfortune one has to carry just to survive, Adrien's character lived up to that. We saw it, the struggle and transformation. It was the beauty this film carried, no wonder that for me an Oscar is not ample enough to appreciate the brilliance of human experience excellently told to the mass.Funny it is when my brother's girlfriend recommended me this film and after watching it, I can't get over it. I was even impressed to myself when I shared it to my officemate that she told me how vivid my recollections where. I can't explain it, but probably because of my craving for a beautiful story made me grasp the film in just one go. Just like ""Joyeux Noel"" an opposite of this film, though with same worldly issues and situations, strengthened my attachment to them.There so much to tell about this film and I'm really looking forward for the book the film is based. There so much of the detail probably I've missed but the film is brilliant enough to compress those in my opinion."

jkochoa4966,"Jul 26, 2011",N/A,"This is an excellent movie/biography of a famed Jewish and Polish pianist during the occupation of Poland (specifically Warsaw) from 1939-45. Over the course of the filming Adrian Brody lost an astonishing amount of weight while he realistically portrayed a Jewish man that suffers horrific indignities while imprisoned in the Warsaw Ghetto. Roman Polanski the director spliced some incidents of his own childhood (as he lived in Krackau during the Nazi occupation) and those of the real Pianist, along with some other experiences of Poles and Jews in the Polish Ghettos at that same time. This picture was filmed in Poland in some of the oldest existing apartment blocks to provide some realism, and the movie relies very little on special effects during the German invasion or that of the Soviet/German fighting and destruction while the city was nearly destroyed. It was very interested to see real (although brief) footage and faces of Warsaw peacetime before the Sept 1 1939 invasion. No doubt many of those people did not survive the years of occupation, genocide and war and were the real people that this movie tries to portray. Thomas Kretchsmann is memorable as the real life German officer who has some interaction with Brody's character and was celebrated later in life for helping some Jews survive Nazi occupation."
mls4182,"Jul 21, 2024",10/10,"As I'm sure you already guessed, this film is about unbearable cruelty and violence. It will leave you angry at humanity, maybe even upset with God. My advice is have a comedy ready, or some happy and life affirming as activity at the ready after this film is over.The writing, direction, acting, costumes and sets are all excellent and will make you feel you're back in WWII Poland.Films about the Holocaust can be unbearable to watch, but it is important to know these things and remember and to bow we would do everything in outlr power to prevent them from happening again.No one is completely above hate and prejudice. When those feelings arise, watching films like this will set you straight."
Nikkipnw,"Oct 26, 2025",10/10,"Absolutely cannot go wrong with this movie.

afarmuhali,"Oct 6, 2024",10/10,"""The Pianist"" is one of those films that hits you hard and stays with you. It's raw, brutal, and absolutely gripping from start to finish. What really stands out for me is the way it captures the desperation and loneliness without overdoing it. The silence in some scenes is more powerful than any dialogue could ever be. I felt like I was there, just trying to survive along with the main character. Some parts are tough to watch, but that's what makes it so real. It's beautifully shot and heartbreaking, and while it's long, I never felt like it dragged. Definitely one of the most intense and emotional war films I've seen."
mcgrathian,"Jul 30, 2025",9/10,"My true rating for this movie would be a 9.3/10 (9/10 doesn't do it enough justice).Adrien Brody's acting was so outstanding. This entire movie had me feeling terrible and devastated. Truly this movie was one of the greatest films of all time. I've seen many movies that make me feel terrible, but something about this movie was different. I felt so bad the whole time, even though there was a happy ending. I don't plan on rewatching this movie any time soon because of what it made me feel. I absolutely recommend everyone to watch this masterpiece."
ribexev,"Apr 4, 2024",10/10,"A very depressing and emotionally draining experince and it works incredibly well for the movie. Every actor does a fantastic job with the main actor pulling of one of the best acting performences of all time. The constume and setting design is perfect and that pared with the acting makes it very easy to get invested and sucked into the setting. The colour pallet changing depending on the state of warsaw and the weather was a subtle addition but added a lot to the experience. The Music was great to.Now im not sure if the story in this movie about the pianist himself was entirly 100% accurate, I think it probably very accurate but I thought the same thing for schindlers list but apperantly it was actually pretty unaccurate of the portrail of Oskar Schindler. But that aside the movie has perfect acting, constume and setting design, make up and cinematography as well as historical accuracy that it almost feels like your watching real footage from the holocaust."
skymovies,"Oct 2, 2003",7/10,"Heavy subject matter frightens people. Few dared say an unkind word about Philadelphia (AIDS!) when it first came out, regardless of the fact that it was dreadful. Folks seem similarly reluctant to find fault with The Pianist (The Holocaust!), though it's a far superior film.Being a survivor himself, Polanski is to be applauded for his clear-eyed depiction of life and death in the Jewish ghetto, but his matter-of-factness had a curiously distancing effect on me. I felt uninvolved. It was also a brave move to omit subtitles from the German dialogue, but getting the gist of what is being said is not the same as understanding and once more I felt left out.Further, many of the events leading to changes in Szpilman's situation remain unclear. On other occasions, Polanski labours his point and I just wanted him to move on to the next episode. He's a very good director, but he won the Oscar amidst a very weak field (and I include Scorsese's work on Gangs Of New York) - remember that this is the same body of people that anointed Ron Howard 'best director' a year previously.Impressive at times, but uneven and occasionally sluggish and frustrating."

Wladyslaw Spillman must be turning in his grave!"
Angle Eyes,"Feb 11, 2003",8/10,"This movie is beautifully shot and features some great acting. It has a nice mix of romance, drama and action scenes. The piano music fits the story nicely. I could not help but compare ThePianist to Schindler'sList, which i think is slightly better, as it has a more complete plot. ThePianist's plot is a bit thin; we get to see how the Jewish Pianist experiences the war years in Poland, chronologically. There's only a very thin connection between the things that happen and the fact that he's a pianist, which imho is not so satisfactory.Don't get me wrong; it's a good, sad, movie: see it if you can."
Holt344,"Nov 28, 2018",10/10,"This movie got everything right from the cinematography to the soundtrack, just pure perfection.
It was realistic, almost too realistic as it's depressing but in a good way. It feels real and you feel immersed from start to finish and it's because the director, Roman Polanski's knowledge and understanding of the holocaust and also the incredible acting performance of Adrien Brody, just stunning to look at. Seeing his transformation into a holocaust survivor and giving 100% into the role made this one of the best performances I've seen this year.
I'm glad that they showed that there were lots of Germans helping the Jews.They managed to create something more than a movie, this is pure art."
slguitartronics,"Jun 7, 2024",10/10,"Among the many world war movies and series, ""The Pianist"" definitely stands out in an extraordinary position. It was hard for me to watch in the first hour due to the raw natural emotional nature it showcased. This movie did a superb job in making the viewer grasp the feeling of anxiousness, fear, the unpredictable nature of the world war and the immense brutality the people faced. There were so many emotional scenes. The fact it had many silent time slots, did a great job in showcasing the emptiness and dullness to the viewer. The main actor Adrien Brody did a marvellous job.Good job in the musical parts as well. The accuracy of the piano playing is highly commendable as well.Finally, this truly in one Masterpiece!"
saharfarahzad,"Jun 26, 2025",8/10,"The Pianist broke me in silence.Szpilman, staring out the window - helpless, starving, and unable to scream - that's where the real pain was.He wasn't fighting. He was enduring.And when he touched the piano, it wasn't just music.It was everything he couldn't say - his fear, his loneliness, his humanity - poured into the keys.A reminder that even in war, humanity can survive - barely, but beautifully.The Pianist wasn't just a film for me - it felt like an old wound being reopened with every scene.Everything about it was painful. From the moment Szpilman was left alone, to the way he watched the world collapse from behind shattered windows, hungry and silent.The silence in this film was heavier than any scream. It was like you could hear people breaking, even when no one spoke.Adrien Brody's performance made me feel like I wasn't just watching - I was there with him. I was hungry. I was scared. I was surviving.He showed a kind of loneliness that words can't describe - you just have to feel it.What hit me hardest was that there were no real heroes. In this world, being a hero meant staying alive. Staying quiet. Swallowing tears. Moving forward when there was nothing left.The Pianist reminded me how deeply human we become in the darkest moments.And that piano... echoing through the ruins...
I can still hear it."
drhoads-93743,"Jan 4, 2019",10/10,"You can't do a Holocaust movie unless it's going to be great. If it's not great, then it's terrible. No in between.The Pianist is great. Challenges and triumphs. And not just your typical Holocuast film. It has something to offer. It's its own thing.Polanski doesn't just lazily try to pull at your heartstrings and hope you'll hand him an Oscar (which he couldn't accept in person). This is very much story-driven.It's not just tragic. There's more to it than that.If you haven't seen it, trust me. Watch it. And keep watching. It gets better and better."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Feb 25, 2025",8/10,"A systematic oppression, segregation, inhumane agony inflicted by both Nazi authorities and common german folks are beyond comprehension.The anguish and trials endured by the Jewish community during World War II are unspeakable, unimaginable!Roman Polanski in his role as a director, masterfully resurrected these haunting memories, vividly portraying the horror experienced by the Jews, a trauma that has left indelible scars on them as well as on their entire generation.One need not belong to the community to empathize with their suffering; if one has a good heart and one functioning intellect, the raw and unfiltered way of storytelling here will resonate deeply.And last but not the least, Adrien Brody poured his heart his soul, his everything into the character, earning a myriad of accolades, including the most revered Academy Award, for a performance that is undeniably profound and impactful.Thoroughly deserving!"

george.schmidt,"Dec 30, 2002",N/A,"THE PIANIST (2002) **** Adrien Brody gives the performance of his career as brilliant pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew, who miraculously survived the aftermath of the Nazis' relentless takeover of the Warsaw ghetto, where he hid for years and ultimately the only surviving member of his doomed family, at the height of WWII in Europe.  Filmmaker Roman Polanski delivers his most intimate and compelling work in years (Polanski himself is a Holocaust survivor who experienced intense loss) filtering his own life experiences into his dogged protagonist with all-too painful and assertively unflinching portrait of an exceptionally gifted musician in an unending nightmare replete with graphic violence that comes without warning, hope in the least likely forms and ultimately triumph in the face of evil. One of the best films about the Holocaust and one of the best films of the year as well."
LydiaOLydia,"Aug 25, 2006",4/10,"The Pianist is a by the numbers movie about the life and times of a pianist trying to live through the Nazi occupation of Warsaw. A beautiful musical score predictably results. The pianist himself is an altogether unsympathetic character - we want him to live because we don't want to be cruel, but otherwise we wouldn't have any particular attraction to this man. The movie itself is strictly, for the most part, paint by numbers. Nazis are bad, Jews are innocent yet determined survivors. Well, more to the point, Nazis are bad, though deep down inside they appreciate fine culture and some of them have good hearts. The Soviets, on the other hand, are uniformly bad and stupid, it seems.The lessons of the Holocaust must never be forgotten. However, the pivotal lessons of the Holocaust are not ""Nazis are bad Jews are innocent yet determined survivors."" Those sort of lessons are historical details along the lines of ""The Magna Carta was signed in 1066."" The real lessons of the Holocaust center around what happens when we stop looking at each other as human beings and start looking at each other as cartoons or stereotypes. This is a by the numbers movie specifically because it does what most movies do - it starts with existing cartoon/stereotype views and builds characters around them to tell a story. A better movie would have begun in that place, but then used the power and magic of film to challenge our preconceptions and our stereotypes to truly convey and reinforce a message of hope for humanity.Your life will not be any poorer if you never see this movie, but you won't feel that you wasted your time, either, if you do. Certainly doesn't belong in the IMDb Top 250."
imdbfan-455592,"Jul 29, 2025",10/10,"The Pianist is an account of the true life experience of a Polish pianist during WW2, in the context of the deportation of the Jewish community to the Ghetto of Warsaw, a setting virtually absent from all films inspired on WW2.Polanski (himself a child survivor of the Krakow and Warsaw ghettos) could have described in more detail the legendary, desperate fighting of the Jewish resistance in the ghetto of Warsaw, or the horrific mass extermination in concentration camps. Instead, the film gains in intensity by displaying the war from the pianist's own point of view (through windows, half-opened doors, holes in the walls - with big emphasis on the use of ""point of view shooting"" by the cameraman). One cannot help feeling disturbed by the most enthralling scenes of the film, as the isolated pianist tries to ensure his survival in the ghetto and ruins of Warsaw, hiding and fleeing, moving from one bombed house to the next, gradually becoming a shadow of his former self, hungry and afraid (merit largely attributed to the extraordinary performance by Adrien Brody, who visibly loses half of his weight throughout the film).Does the pianist raise any sympathy from the audience? Not immediately, in my view. The pianist is more than often a drifting character, almost a witness of other people's and his own horrors. He seems to float and drift along the film like a lost feather, with people quickly appearing and disappearing from his life, some helping generously, others taking advantage of his quiet despair, always maintaining an almost blank, dispassionate demeanour. One may even wonder why we should care in the least about this character. But we do care. That is, I believe, the secret to this film's poetry.In one of the strongest scenes, towards the end, a German officer forces the pianist to play for his life, in an episode that suddenly brings a much lighter, beautifully poetic shade to the film (this German officer will be probably compared to Schindler, although his philanthropy does not quite share the same basis).This is also a wonderful tribute to Polish artists, through Chopin's music, with the concert at the very end of the film and the opening performance by the pianist at the local radio station (with the sound of bomb explosions in the background) forming an harmonious link between the beginning and end of the film (following Polanski's usual story-frame).Overall, The Pianist is one of the most detailed and shocking accounts of the treatment of the Jews by the Nazis, with the atmosphere in Warsaw well captured and believable. Quite possibly, The Pianist will remain in the history of film-making as the most touching and realistic portraits of the holocaust ever made.Polanski's film deserves a strong presence in the 2003 Oscar nominations, including a nomination for Adrien Brody's amazing performance, Polanski's sublime direction, best adapted screenplay and, obviously, best picture. This could be, at last, Polanski's long awaited, triumphal comeback to the high and mighty Hollywood."
panchodh_12,"Jul 20, 2015",8/10,"Soundtrack for this review: El pianista del gueto de Varsovia by Jorge DrexlerIt is hard to review this movie. It is not easy to evaluate this movie in terms of its acting, its quality, its directing, with an armchair attitude that ignores the crudeness and harshness of real life. It is hard to say phrases like ""Roman Polanski, perhaps due to its own experience, captures perfectly the feeling of everyday life of Polish Jews during the Second World War, its sadness and despair but also the tiny moments of hope"", however true that might be.It is very hard to rate this just as a movie, and not as a reminder for the human race of what are we capable of. I'm often reluctant to watch Holocaust movies because I know beforehand that they will have very hard to digest moments, and they are almost an act of masochism, two hours of intense suffering. But they are necessary, they are real stories that urge to be told, and need to be heard so that they don't happen again.In a world where islamophobic parties are winning votes in Europe, where Americans proudly wave a flag that is the symbol of slavery in front of their president, these movies are indispensable. We cannot allow ourselves to fall into the collective madness that Germany fell into between 1933 and 1945. We should have learnt by now that technology has allowed the State to mobilize way too many resources, and the extermination of an entire group of people is only a button away. Not to mention the fact that these things still happen in more remote corners of the world, where they don't destabilize global geopolitics.So it would be too frivolous from my side to evaluate Polanski's direction or Brody's acting, as if this was fiction. The feeling I have after having watched The Pianist is not the one of a film critic that passively observes reality from behind his desk, but an active one, the imperative of making sure that nothing like this ever happens again."
klasylcena,"Sep 17, 2025",10/10,"It's one of the few films that shows the reality of life in Poland during the war. The struggle against this nightmare and despair is beautifully portrayed, and the ending itself made me cry. Added to that, Brodie's impeccable acting makes it a simply beautiful film that I wholeheartedly recommend.."
berilturan,"Feb 16, 2025",10/10,"The Pianist is an amazing drama film about World War 2. It tells the true story of Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish and Jewish pianist who faces many dangers.The whole cast gave an amazing performance and the star of the film Adrien Brody gave an incredible performance as Szpilman. His emotions feel real and his transformation is shocking. Also the director Roman Polanski did a great job.The soundtrack of The Pianist is just beautiful it makes you cry even more. The Pianist is the best film I've ever watched and it made me cry 2 hours straight, it is a really sad and unforgettable film. Every movie lover should watch it."
truemythmedia,"Nov 11, 2019",8/10,"If I'm being honest, I think Polanski winning the best director Oscar for this film is sort of like Scorsese winning his Oscar for ""The Departed""; both awards feel a bit like consolation Oscars. What do I mean by that? Well, I don't believe that this is the best film Polanski has put out; in fact, I wouldn't even put it in his top three. It is a good film, however, and with all the amazing movies that Polanski produced during his career I'm glad that he found a bit of recognition, even if it is for a film that isn't as polished as some of his others.Polanski himself said that his was the most personal film he's ever made, and there's good reason for that. Polanski was in his preteens when WWII washed over Poland, and he, like Wladyslaw Szpilman, survived the ghettos while their families were less fortunate (Polanski's mother was killed in Auschwitz). ""The Pianist"" shows a side of the holocaust that we rarely see, for it's not from the perspective of the camps which we see most of the film, but from the perspective of one who has escaped the camps and is still forced to live in a prison of isolation and degradation.As a whole, I think the story told in this movie is wonderful, and since it is based on a true story, it's hard to criticize it too much for structure, but at the same time, I do feel that this movie starts to drag in the second act. Most of the truly disturbing stuff happens in the first half of this film. The parts where Szpilman is separated from his family, the purging of the ghetto, the moving to concentration camps... all of that stuff happens within the first hour and fifteen minutes, and the last hour of this movie is mostly focused on Szpilman trying to stay quiet in apartments, trying to figure out what's gong on outside, and struggling to get over sickness. By no means does the story ever get boring- it's still fascinating, but the horrors of the first half of this movie are far more memorable than those in the second half."

kekca,"Jan 22, 2014",9/10,"The piano which is my favorite musical instrument. After is the violin and the sax. Which is second I can not say. Music – a form of freedom, playing music – of liberation, composing music – special case of the creationist providence.Away from the fact that I saw this movie long time ago I probably will never forget it. A chased piano player in the contrast of the war and the ruined buildings is an image of contradiction which dives in the mind and lay there for a a very long time. The only one ability of man to succeed in expressing and protecting him is something very special. And what if the circumstances are force marjorie? Is it creativity the only one string deep in us that love is pulling to sing its humble messages?Really wonderful movie but not for everyone. It shows human survival which is threatened by man an believing in only one thing when everything around is falling apart. It shows how when we walk in the right direction there is always a new way.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"
angelacurtis,"Aug 19, 2024",7/10,"Polanski does a superb job of recreating the world of WWII Poland. Every detail of the film is exact and mesmerizing (helped greatly by casting non-name actors who inhabit their roles with great feeling and authenticity. There is no opportunity to play ""spot the star"" except for the most seasoned filmgoer.) What happens to Brody is so startlingly, stunningly jaw-dropping it seems surreal at times. Amazingly, Polanski is able to occasionally inject the faintest touches of black humor and irony to this, which makes for some very intriguing viewing. That is not to say that the film is easy to watch. Already a master (for decades) of creating feelings of unease, paranoia and fear in the viewer, Polanski sets into motion a film in which the audience can hardly breathe for fear that their own noise will result in the discovery of the frequently hidden Brody. The film is notable for making sounds such as marching boots, idling cars and faraway voices seem more terrifying than anything Hollywood has ever had to offer in all of its multitudinous thrillers and horror films."
snsh,"Aug 11, 2003",2/10,"Seeing the Pianist movie really bothered me, partly because 10 years after Schindler's List, it seems like so much less of a movie.  It's not groundbreaking.  The production quality isn't better.  The leading man acts with a deer-in-headlights expression.But I was mostly bothered by the anti-hero Szpilman.  He's a selfish person, concerned only with his own survival.  Other people give him a lot of assistance, not because he deserves it, but because he's talented.  Is this good?  I don't know.  It seems good that the people of Poland risked and sacrificed much to protect a gifted musician through the Holocaust.  But I don't find Szpilman likable.  Especially after reading ""1952"" at the close of the movie -- I just wanted to bop him in the nose what a jerk.It also bothers me that Hollywood -- or rather, the Academy -- seems to overreward piano playing characters.  Look at the movies the pianist, the piano, shine.  You want to win an oscar...play the piano!"
steiner-sam,"Apr 19, 2024",9/10,"It's a Warsaw Ghetto World War II survivor biopic of Wladyslaw Szpilman set from 1939 to 1945. The film begins with 28-year-old Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) playing live on Warsaw radio in September 1939 when the German invasion begins. He is already well-known in Polish cultural circles. We meet Szpilman's family; he appears to be the oldest child. Wladyslaw is somewhat aloof; his brother Henryk (Ed Stoppard) is much more politically aggressive. His parents, Samuel (Frank Finlay) and Edwarda (Maureen Lipman), are upper class and hardly know how to respond.""The Pianist"" follows Szpilman's pivotal experiences over the next six years. The family first lives in the ""Little"" part of the Warsaw Ghetto. Szpilman is separated from his family and becomes a slave laborer before escaping the ghetto and living with the help of non-Jewish friends in increasingly difficult circumstances. In the last months of 1944, he is even saved by a German officer (Thomas Kretschmann) who learns Szpilman is a skilled pianist.What is remarkable about ""The Pianist"" is that it does not portray Wladyslaw Szpilman as a hero. He is primarily passive and survives on the generosity of others. He sees many heinous atrocities and sometimes tries to help others, but mainly reacts when danger is imminent. ""The Pianist"" exudes authenticity because of this approach.Although I wish Polanski had faced a criminal trial in the United States, he is a brilliant director. The pacing and visuals are excellent. Adrien Brody is superb."
ruby_fff,"Jan 19, 2003",8/10,"The Pianist is a beautiful film in spite of the obvious bleak subject: the survival of pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, a Polish Jew during WWII in Warsaw. The film has much warmth - human spirit a-kindled behind it all. Adrien Brody is simply superb (almost surreal) in his true to life portrayal of Szpilman - tenacity and courage personified beyond reproach. We get to see a quieter side of Brody (Eric the war photo-journalist in Elie Chouraqui's ""Harrison's Flowers"" 2000, Sam the union organizer in Ken Loach's ""Bread and Roses"" 2000, Ritchie in Spike Lee's ""Summer of Sam"" 1999) - an impressive, subdued performance all the way. Of course, director Roman Polanski is the sustaining unrelenting force throughout the entire 2 hrs. 28 mins. filmic journey. (In his interview with Charlie Rose on PBS, Brody mentioned that he was expected to lose 30 lbs. in weight to inhabit the lead role's emaciating period, besides prompted to diligently play Chopin on the piano for 6 months, 6 days a week.)This is much more than just another Holocaust movie (neither ""Schindler's List"" or ""Sophie's Choice""). It's Polanski's own: he gave the film quite an emotionally restrained treatment, almost felt like a documentary with doses of stark photography, not without hints of poetry at times. Have patience, there is action, suspense, and you shall be rewarded towards last part of the film, with teardrops for sure. Actually, occasional smiles and a chuckle were afforded. It is taut human drama complete - even though we know of the outcome, we still worry and startle, relieve and sigh along with Brody's character at his brush with danger throughout the film. The audience is very much in the first person alone and lonely with Szpilman on the screen. And when joy arrives, it's truly touching.The story is based on Szpilman's book (written 4 years after the war) with screenplay by Ronald Harwood (Cry the Beloved Country 1995, Mandela - TV 1987, The Dresser 1983.) The soundtrack included many Frédéric Chopin (1810-1849) piano pieces: Nocturne, Ballade, Prelude, Waltz, Polonaise and Mazurka. Wojciech Kilar provided additional music, and Hervé de Luze on film editing - both have collaborated on Polanski's ""Ninth Gate, The"" 1999, and ""Death and the Maiden"" 1994. Cinematography by Pawel Edelman, who was in many film projects by Polish writer-director Andrzej Wajda. Production designer Allan Starski and costume designer Anna Sheppard were involved in Steven Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" 1993. It's worthwhile to visit the official Web site:  Kudos to everyone involved on this project - such integrity and strength, and to R.P. Productions, Focus Features (also distributed Todd Hayne's ""Far From Heaven"" 2002), and Studio Canal.Roman Polanski's ""The Pianist"" truly deserved the Cannes Film Festival 2002 Palme d'Or award for the Best Feature film."

Themes of resilience, war brutality, and art's transformative power are central. Adrien Brody's performance is lauded for its emotional depth. The realistic portrayal of the Warsaw Ghetto and Nazi atrocities is noted for historical accuracy. Emotions span despair, fear, hope, and determination. Chopin's music underscores the film's core.

With its stunning cinematography, powerful performances, and historical significance, the film is a must-watch for anyone interested in World War II history, music, or simply great storytelling. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, capturing the bleakness and despair of war-torn Warsaw. The muted color palette and precise camerawork convey the sense of claustrophobia and fear that permeates the world of the main character. The score, featuring Chopin's haunting Nocturne in C-sharp minor, is equally impressive.Adrien Brody's portrayal of the main character is nuanced and captivating. He brings a depth and vulnerability to the role, perfectly capturing the emotional turmoil and resilience of the character. Brody's performance is understated yet powerful, conveying the complexity of the character's experiences without resorting to melodrama. The film sheds light on the atrocities committed during World War II, particularly the persecution of Jews in Poland. The direction is sensitive and respectful, avoiding gratuitous violence and instead focusing on the human cost of war.The movie explores themes of survival, hope, and the power of music, highlighting the struggles of those who were forced to live in hiding. The film's historical significance cannot be overstated. It provides a unique perspective on the experiences of Jews during World War II and serves as a reminder of the atrocities that were committed. The performances in the film are outstanding, with Brody delivering a tour-de-force performance. Overall, The Pianist is a powerful and emotional film that is not to be missed. With its masterful storytelling, outstanding performances, and historical significance, it is a film that will stay with you forever.The film's impact lingers long after the credits roll, leaving the viewer to ponder the themes and emotions that have been evoked. In conclusion, The Pianist is a film that will leave you breathless and haunted. It is a testament to the human spirit and the power of music to transcend even the darkest of times. If you're a fan of historical dramas or just great storytelling, then this film is a must-see."
bhatian,"Oct 27, 2007",8/10,"I had the DVD of this film for over 3 years and never watched it, because I never really had the time in between my hectic schedule to watch this film, but when I did read the reviews of the film on IMDb, it grabbed me so much that I finally decided to watch this film at mid-night (after my entire days schedule). I must say that it was WORTH every minute (late at night).Every single actor in the film had a realism in their character which is very uncommon in many international films. It seems that the director 'made sure' that the film grabs you inside the TV/Screen and puts the viewer in the space and time of Warsaw massacre. Having said this, the props were well selected and felt real.The story telling and the chronology was well synchronized along side the classical composition of Szpilman.This film is not about the Holocaust but about one man and his will to survive the evil that prevailed during the times of Hitler. This film also goes to show 'why should an innocent Jew suffer from the higher level of political war that prevails on this earth'. He just want's to be left alone and continue with his normal life. He has nothing to do with the war, but with his survival and his life. ""Why should he die, if he is not guilty"".In conclusion, this film conveys a message to all of us that we do not need to fight with opponent to win anything, but we need to find way's out of the trouble and war that has 'nothing to do with us'. This is a lesson we must all learn from this film.I am proud of Szpilman and many more who followed his footsteps, because they are the real winners of the war.MUST SEE THIS FILM.My score: 8 out of 10Regards, Neil Bhatia"

paintingariver,"Aug 14, 2012",N/A,"In this dark, epic and moving film, the suffering of Jews in the Warsaw ghetto is brought to life. Brody's performance, for which he won an Oscar, is breathtaking. With understated and fine-tuned acting, he portrays Władysław Szpilman, a talented Polish Jewish pianist who struggles to survive during the German occupation of Poland. The characters were very realistic, because they were not just good or bad--the Jews had mixed reactions toward the violence in the ghettos, the Poles helping the Jews escape had varying motives (some slightly dubious), a Nazi officer aided Szpilman near the end of the movie. The slow infiltration of anti-Semitism is portrayed realistically--first, Szpilman's family must wear stars of David on their arms, a seemingly harmless requirement. However, the Nazis' demands quickly escalate and soon the family is forced into the Warsaw ghetto. What began with a star on a coat sleeve culminates in Szpilman's family being taken to the ghetto, and then later to a concentration camp. My favorite scene is when Szpilman is confined to an empty apartment with a piano. Unable to make any noise, he sits down and runs his fingers along the keys as if playing. We hear the music, but see only his fingers making patterns across the keys. This scene is brilliantly directed and in a way symbolizes the Poland that Szpilman once knew, now forever changed by the Holocaust.http://bitesizemoviereview.blogspot.com/"
MovieGuy109,"Nov 25, 2011",10/10,"After declining to direct Schindler's List due to personal reasons, Polanski set out direct a WWII survival story of his own. The Pianist lacks the narrative sweep of Schindler's List but has strong acting and personal direction. The film is beautifully crafted and original from other similar motion pictures. It distinguishes itself from Polanski's other masterpieces because it has the heart his films usually do not possess. It's just as haunting as his other movies but the beauty and sickness of humanity are contrasted in a way that not even Polanski has ever successfully done before. By far Adrien Brody's finest performance and probably Polanski's best film."
aaikido,"Sep 29, 2024",N/A,"The Pianist is a film that leaves a profound impression and stays with you long after the credits roll. It tells the story of the Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman, who witnessed the persecution of the Nazis during World War II. What sets this film apart is not only its historical narrative, but the way it sensitively portrays the character of Szpilman and his struggle to maintain his humanity in the face of unimaginable adversity.From the very beginning, the audience is given a clear and multifaceted picture of the pianist, which continues to develop throughout the film. Szpilman, portrayed by Adrien Brody, is a pacifist and morally upright character, who never resorts to violence, even when it seems like the only chance for survival. This quiet but powerful stance that he maintains throughout gives his character a silent dignity, and you can feel his inner strength carrying him through moments that threaten to break him - and it is precisely this resilience that makes him a symbol of humanity in inhumane times.Adrien Brody's performance is so authentic that it feels as if the events are unfolding in real time. It's as though an invisible camera has captured reality itself - Brody disappears into the role of the pianist. The emotional depth he brings to this character is overwhelming, and he manages to convey so much with so little dialogue. Every movement, every desperate glance, tells more about Szpilman's inner world than words ever could.A key element that elevates the film even further is the music. As a pianist, music is not just Szpilman's profession but an expression of his inner will to survive. The piano pieces that flow through the film are more than just a soundtrack - they are the voice of his soul amidst the horror. Particularly, the scene with Hosenfeld, where he once again sits at the piano after all the suffering, gives the film a bittersweet conclusion that deeply touches the heart. The music serves as an emotional bridge that transforms the story into an unforgettable reflection on the emotions of Szpilman.This intense emotional effect is reinforced by the brilliant direction of Roman Polanski. Every scene is so meticulously crafted that it pulls the viewer directly into the horror that the victims of the Holocaust endured. Polanski's storytelling is never sensationalistic but always respectful and deeply moving. You can almost physically feel the suffering of the people, making the film difficult to watch but all the more impactful.What ultimately makes The Pianist so significant is its powerful message. The film leaves the viewer with one clear takeaway: Humanity is our most precious asset, and the cruelty of persecution shows just how valuable this asset truly is. It's nearly impossible to watch this film without coming away with a broader perspective on the world and the history of the Holocaust. The film masterfully places us in the shoes of an innocent man who suffers greatly, making hatred and prejudice feel inconceivable by the end.For me, The Pianist is one of the best films ever made about the persecution of Jews during World War II. It manages to be both historically significant and emotionally profound - a true masterpiece that moves viewers deeply and encourages reflection long after it ends."
lee_eisenberg,"May 23, 2006",9/10,"In what I assume was Roman Polanski's most personal movie ever, he tells the story of Polish-Jewish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) doing everything possible to survive the Nazi occupation. As is the case with all of Polanski's movies, there are some very harrowing scenes, namely when the Nazi planes first start bombing the city, and when Szpilman has to hide. As Szpilman, Brody really brings out the most in the character (no doubt his sad face helps with that).I will say that the movie doesn't quite equal the profundity achieved by ""Schindler's List"". But maybe that's not a fair comparison, since Polanski probably wasn't aiming for that. Either way, this is definitely a movie worth seeing, as a message of hope in the darkest of times."
tuningcourse,"Jan 11, 2005",10/10,"Polanski, unlike any other filmmaker, has a way of getting into your very core and evoking unconcsious emotions that seem to manifest themselves for days after. The Pianist is the type of film that initially strikes one as powerful, but perhaps so much so that its core essence requires time to settle and be processed. As several days have passed, I find my focus of attention ever more on the film and the ingenious manner in which it was designed. Really, few words will do the film justice but if I may say visually stunning and existentially powerful, perhaps that may be a meager start. The film is less a story of the main character's nightmarish struggle for survival during the unspeakable occupation of the Nazis in Warsaw; it is a pure visual study of hell observed primarily through the character. My God, how Polanski orchestrates this feat of cinematic power is hard to discern but his consistency in doing so is nothing less than pure genius. From the character's hideaway in an abandoned flat and the brutality of German soldiers always occurring at a distance as a panoramic backdrop to the character is an element I've never really seen done on this type of scale. If I may say Polanski has succeeded in creating a new cinematic dynamic, that wouldn't be an exaggeration. In the present climate of Hollywood silliness and superficiality, The Pianist is a rare achievement that rates it among the best films of all time, if not for its incredible usage of technique, but for its utter message of human evil and the struggle for survival against that evil which we, as the present generation, must always remember and never forget. Go see it."
Jasper-Fox,"Jul 25, 2021",10/10,"I would re-watch this film every single year. My favorite part is when the pianist hides himself in that apartment, eating crumbs, starving nearly to death, playing imaginary piano and watching tank destroying resistentes from window - it's a confinement but also a safe shell, with delicate comfort and delusion and temptation of death and aspiration of life. It's like my own personal experience when facing stress, hiding myself in a physiological or physical safe corner, facing the temptation to live like this for the rest of my life, and finally force myself to get out to face the outside world. It's really some echo here.And those playing - what marvelous art pieces!Probably the best film ever about WWII on my list."
djhenebury-1,"Dec 14, 2005",10/10,"""The Pianist"" is one of the best movies i've ever seen. After seeing the ""Ninth gate"" i didn't expect much of Roman Polanski, but the pianist is truly great and should certainly be on your ""movies-to-watch-list"". The movie has it's gentle parts in which the main character Wladyslaw Szpilman (Adrien Brody) plays Chopin. But it also shows the horrors of the second world war. While Szpilman tries to save himself people around him are being killed and starved to death in the Warsaw ghetto, including his family. Adrien Brody, by the way, performs absolutely brilliant. Polanski confronts war, suffering, despair, hope and the choices of Wladyslaw Szpilman, which are based on the book and life of Szpilman, in this movie."
ChrisQ,"Jun 8, 2004",10/10,"I wanted to see this film when it in the cinemas - but thought it might be difficult to watch.When the DVD was released, I bought it but still found reasons to leave it till later.Finally I viewed it in two halves. It is a magnificent piece of work - desperately sad, perfectly acted and made with infinite care.It is profoundly unsettling to ponder on the behaviour of humankind. Why are some capable of such monstrous inhumanity while others behave with unbelievable selflessness to total strangers in need?The few reviewers who thought this film lacked action and was boring, can I respectfully suggest they stick to less demanding fare in which no thought process is required at all.For others who have not yet seen this film - please do so - but be prepared to be very moved by it.Adrien Brody will surely never surpass his brilliant performance in the role of Wladyslaw Szpilman. Roman Polanski has made the movie of his career. 10/10"
jhaile1,"Oct 1, 2006",10/10,"What a film!The character played by Adrien Brody was so magnificently and accurately projected. Compared to other films of the era, the actor projected the character with dignity. Even when it was so difficult to remain rational in an irrational time, the character was humble and focused. The characters played by the other cast members were just as smart and outstanding, some times challenging to understand as to why 'Henrick'would react in the way he does to some of the brutes the Germans inflict on ""Jewish prisoners."" Despite his reactions it was also refreshing to know that he would refuse to join the 'Zander Commanders', which he could but he declines to the offer. In times of such difficulties people would do anything to sustain their life even if it is for a second, yet 'Henrick' would refuse to abide by that nature of human traits. Some one said once, 'temptation is a true measure of character.' Even though by joining the 'Zander Commander' he could have benefited himself and his families' stay in the camp would have been improved for the remaining of their days before they were gassed should he join, but he was clear and firm that he wouldn't join'em. It was also comforting to learn that some people in the Polish civil society remained rational in such trying times, such as hiding Szpilman in their flats. Why would they take risk in hiding a Jewish man in their house?I have seen many films projecting a certain time-frame in the history of mankind, this film by far outplays them all. Like 'The Diary of Anne Frank this too is based on true story that really took place in the last century. The Jewish people have suffered tremendously thru out history, especially in Europe. The story projected in this film tingles a normal human to a state of sadness to a point of making one question that such people (Germans/NAZIS) did exist at some point in contemporary Europe. Since I have seen this film I grew very interested in learning why people hate others to such a degree? I have yet to come to the understanding of the concept of hate, but I am learning. Some experts say that hate is a result of fear embraced by self doubt that the hate-monger espouse due to fear he/she may not be able to compete and win over the person/s they wish/intend to eradicate."
admat,"Sep 7, 2002",7/10,"Very simple form, very serious and important subject - how to estimate? Second world war, ghettos, Judes extermination are well known topic for Poles and rather unknown for the others, unfortunately... People from European countries, from USA etc. can see the cruelty of war time that Polish people already know. But the form is almost academic and this is why I have some remarks.  First of all: Brody is too young and his play is without feelings, we can feel a big distance between the film director and the film matter (Polanski was a ghetto prisoner!), there is no passion in this movie - like it was in Spielberg's ""Schindler List"". I can't just say: ""good film"" or ""bad film"", but I should say: ""very realistic""."
montydk,"May 3, 2003",1/10,"I will admit i saw this film by mistake, but how can anyone like this movie it's long and boooooring.

oglydoglin,"Oct 26, 2002",N/A,"The longer the 2nd WW is behind us, the more films and books fill in our perception of that event. The most important aspect to The Pianist is: it blows away that Disney-Holocaust Spielberg epic. Polanski is very modest here, and that suits him and the film. The fact that the things we don't see, but only suggested with, are even more horrific than the horror we do get to see is a fantastic approach. It is seldom we can see a picture where one has to think, an fill in, instead of being fed. But there is a downsize: the story stays very close to the book, in fact, it adds nothing new to it, except for the stunning images. With the same imagination we use in the film, we can read the book and get the same result.But then again, the longer ago the event is, the more important nowadays it is for people to go and see this very solid and integer picture. If you are really up to it, go and see the Russian epic called ""Go And See"", and then you will have a truly visual experience what war against an innocent young man is really about..."
philip_vanderveken,"Oct 20, 2004",10/10,"The marketing departments of the different production houses always know how to make a huge hype about a movie. That's why I always try not to see a movie immediately after it gets many international prizes. I don't want to be disappointed because my expectations were just too high.For 'The Pianist' I didn't make an exception and I'm glad I didn't. I just saw it for the first time on DVD and I can only say that this is a true masterpiece. No, not because it got so many awards, neither because Roman Polanski directed it and certainly not because this is a movie about the Jews. I think this is a modern classic and a true masterpiece simply because I was blown away by the story! It shows how the Jews had to live in the ghetto with so many people on so little space, how the Nazi's randomly shot people and humiliated them, but also that not all Germans were such horrible pigs.Roman Polanski made an authentic movie about what happened in the Jewish ghettos and he did an excellent job if you ask me. He didn't portray the war and the Jews the way Spielberg did with Schindler's list. He shows us what happened by following Wvadyslav Szpilman - a young and famous pianist - from the last days before the beginning of the war until the war is over. Don't expect any images from the concentration camps like you saw in Spielberg's movie. The complete story is situated in Warsaw - in the Jewish Ghetto and never leaves it.Roman Polanski did not only create a great visual experience with this movie, it's the music that gives this film an extra and subtle, even poetical touch. There are many scenes of war and destruction, the special effects are very realistic and were never intended to glamorize the movie. Every scene is frightening and realistic, but it is the beautiful classical music that makes all the depicted horrors a little less hard to chew...I can recommend this film to everybody and I'm convinced that every one should see this movie at least once. But I think that the people who are interested in the history of the Jews during the second world war will love this movie the most. I guess that everybody who saw Schindler's list and loved it will love this one as well and I just can't say which one of the two was the best. I rewarded this movie with a 10/10. Don't hesitate to watch it."
eddie_baggins,"Dec 2, 2014",10/10,"Divisive director Roman Polanski has had a polarizing career both behind camera and in a personnel sense yet whatever one may feel about the man or the filmmaker there is little doubt that his most effective and most profound movie is 2002's The Pianist. A true life war tale of incredible determination and bravery, Polanski's telling of accomplished Poland pianist and Jew Wladyslaw Szpilman ranks as one of cinemas greatest War set tales thanks to an incredibly realistic feel and a raft of award worthy acting turns.Justifiably winning Polanski a Best Director Oscar, The Pianist sees the veteran director at his highest creative peak, an artist moulding with his material perfectly to create a vividly alive look into the atrocities that faced Warsaw's Jewish community and all others of similar creeds during Hitler's reign of terror. Polanski's Warsaw is brimming with stark images, from bodies strewn in the streets of the Jewish ""ghettos"", snow covered buildings in the harsh reality of a European winter and the strange comforts of an upmarket café as people go hungry outside, it's unquestionable that the setting of The Pianist is a character unto itself and part of the reason the movie works to the extent it does. It's interesting also to note how many a time Polanski films some of the movies most confronting scenes (wheelchair bound elders thrown from windows etc.) from a wide shot perspective, giving us the viewers a feeling of witnessing these events from far, powerless to stop what is happening yet not to the extent of being unaffected by it, much like our protagonist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It would be remiss now with a decade hindsight of Adrien Brody to not remark on the power he displayed here as Szpilman. Brody inhabits Szpilman to an extent you quickly forget it is an actor you are watching, whether he is brave, scared or as time wears on dangerously gaunt, Brody delivers the Oscar winning turn that seemingly set him up for an illustrious career that so far has sadly failed to eventuate. It's impossible to say with full assurance that it's Brody's fault completely that he has failed to get close creatively to what he delivered here in Polanski's effort or if it is filmmakers that have failed him in their material. Whatever the case may be regarding Brody's disappointing post-Pianist career there is no taking away from his ageless performance here in an ensemble that all play their parts to perfection from Frank Finlay as Szpilman's aging father through to Thomas Kretschmann's small but pivotal role as German captain Wilm Hosenfeld.A heartening tale of survival, an indictment of the horrors of war and the evil within humanity, The Pianist is not always an easy watch but it's an important one. A truly stunning tale of the will to survive and a tension filled 2 and a half hours thanks to Polanski's no fuss professional turn behind camera, this is true life based storytelling at its finest and a worthy film to sit alongside other revered War based film classics.5 bits of caramel out of 5"
namashi_1,"Apr 11, 2010",9/10,"An adaptation of the autobiography of the same name by Jewish-Polish musician Władysław Szpilman, Roman Polanski's 'The Pianist' is one of the finest biopics I've ever seen to date. A biopic that moves you, scares you and gives the you courage to survive in the world where bloodshed is a common thing.'The Pianist' takes us to the legendary journey of the late Władysław Szpilman with predestine. Some people are legendary, some stories are legendary and some films are legendary. All of the three trump cards are available in this film! For me, it's a film that made me the character, I felt like Szpilman every moment, I was hungry when he was hungry, I was scared when he was scared. And I cried when he cried. What A Freaking Life, and What A Bloody Way To Show It!!!Adrien Brody's performance as Szpilman is one of those performances that shine even in the darkest night. It's a performance that is haunted! Brody, you truly are a Hollywood Icon!If you have a DVD player, then, 'The Pianist' should be your first choice for the moment. Two Big Thumbs Up!"
MF210,"May 24, 2003",10/10,"I will say it The Pianist should have won Best Picture. But I am not putting down Chicago, I think both movies are great films. The Pianist is a holocaust movie, which is different from the 1993 masterpiece about the Holocaust, noneother than Schindlers List. The Pianist differs from Schindlers List because it spends all of its time in the Warsaw Ghetto, while Schindlers List spent time in the Ghetto and Labor Camps. We get a different point of view what it was like for the Jews. The Jews that stayed behind were forced to do some labor work for Nazis but their were Jews who were hiding in the Ghetto that fought back against them, though they didnt succeed. You dont see any fighting back in Schindlers List at all.Adrien Brody delivers a great performance as a jewish pianist named Szpillman (not sure about spelling). Not Sure if its an award winning prformance but still a great performance. It maybe but I wanna watch the movie again. One thing I am sure about was that Roman Polanski (Director of the brilliant Chinatown) deserved his Oscar for Best Director, it was brilliant direction by a man who is close to 70 years old. The Pianist is a very well written movie but the screenplay is not award winning, I thought Adaptation should have won.This is my overall paragraph and I have alot of overalls to say. Overall, As much as i loved Chicago, The Pianist should have won for its powerful message and portrayal of what one man went through in the Ghetto during World War II. Overall, I prefer Schindlers List but The Pianist is a great film and will be remembered for years to come. Its a great achievement for Polanski. 10 out of 10."
Ben_Cheshire,"Apr 2, 2004",8/10,"No other medium in the world has the power to illustrate for us what life would have been like in certain periods of the past but the cinema. One of the most important periods to not let go forgotton is the massacre and repression of Jews in Germany and occupied europe. If war and racism led to people to be killed like dogs and worse, simply for belonging to a certain group, then everyone should know about it, in my opinion, to keep history from repeating itself, and to make sure they didn't die for nothing. Don't turn your back on it - stare this movie in the face and look at what racism and intolerance can lead humans to do to other humans.Scene after scene of such penetrating truth and honesty encapsulate in cinematic episodes the horrors committed by the Nazis, the state of desperation of the Jews and many other aspects of this horrible ordeal, based on the personal memoirs of the main character, famed Polish pianist Wladyslaw Szpilman.It was based on the memoirs of Szpilman, which means we know he survives the war, and it was marketed with this in mind, as a survival story. And this, of course, is the main attraction to this movie: not to put oneself through experiencing the horrors of war, which i nevertheless believe is important, but of finding out how in heck a Jew living in Nazi occupied Poland could have survived, and as such it is a remarkable story of hope and courage against unbelievable odds. And not one calculated by a Hollywood studio to manipulate you - this stuff really happened, and to the character portrayed in this movie by Adrian Brody. Some of it also happened to Roman Polanski himself, which made this a very personal project for him.As i mentioned at the beginning, this movie demonstrates the power of cinema, and one of its central themes is the power of the arts, particularly music, to affect people, to make them feel."
Cheesedemon28,"Dec 22, 2003",10/10,"Wow.Let me start by saying that I despise Schindler's List. I loathe it. Spielberg basically turned the Holocaust into a theme park ride. I must also tell you that I don't like Spielberg.Now I must inform you that I am slightly biased. I am a Jewish Polanski fanatic. So to see this film is like to see a masterpiece in play. The most interesting and arguably, the best facet of the film is when the Szpilman familly is discussing what is going on, basically a round table discussion. It shows the exact emotions of most Jews, and non-Jewish poles during the Holocaust with textbook accuracy. Especially considering that Polanksi was a Holocaust survivor, this gives perfect perspective of the Warsaw ghetto.There are also some who say that the fact that Szpilman(sp?) was a pianist had very little to do with the film at all, but in fact, the piano was one of his few motives to survive throughout the whole film.Please, PLEASE, stop saying that there shouldn't be any more films like this. I think people should stop making Holocaust-related films when everyone believes that it actually happened. I personally know human beings that denied it even happened. Venal.So here's the math: Great plot + great premise + wonderful director + great sets + Chopin The Pianist = one of the best films ever made. It's a real shame that it lost out to the tragedy of a film that is Chicago for the best picture oscar.11/10"
Soysoy,"May 23, 2003",10/10,"This movie left me speechless, but I'll try to write some words down though. ;-)I'm quite a picky person when it comes to cinema, and I -almost- always find something to criticize, except for a very little group of movies (this far, 8 movies out of 600+ that I've seen..) that I found flawless. ""The Pianist"" is among them. You don't say.I knew that Polanski is a great filmmaker, for sure, but I'd never expected him to take the whole thing so seriously, putting SO MUCH dedication into creating such a fine piece of art.Polanski has avoided all of the traps common to movies in its genre (the first one coming to one's mind being ""Schindler's list, though to me those are very different movies), and chose to make no compromise at all. No heroism, no cheap emotionally manipulative scenes, no off ""dramatic"" music, nothing to try to grasp the attention of the immature modern film viewer. He decided to make ART, and more than that, he decided to do that with such a heart, and such dignity, that even without the truly mind-blowing filming savoir-faire he used in ""The Pianist"", the movie would have been excellent. But he obviously wanted more, doing his best to serve the story told. I guess he's been preparing this movie with great care, and for a long time.Polanski has set, with ""The Pianist"", a new standard in cinematic excellence. The use of the camera eye is the best I've seen so far since ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and goes even further than these movies in its ability to create a sense of ""being there"". Kubrick left this path for further movies, exploring different (and most of the time very interesting) possibilities. Cronenberg shows the same kind of ability sometimes, but he's focused on a very different aspect of the human's mind (that's the least to say).The focus here is more timeless, it's difficult to put into words, I mean it's not possible to actually EXPLAIN what Polanski has achieved with ""The Pianist"" unless, maybe, someone very talented writes a whole book about it *LOL*. No, this is art, pure art, and relies on the honesty, humanity and total dedication of a *human being*, who just happens to be one of the best filmmakers around. What the film does, that ""2001"" did not, is telling a straight story. It had to, considering the humanist goal. But it also creates this beautiful cinematic poetry, powerfully evocative, that was the signature of ""2001"" and ""Barry Lyndon"", and more recently of Lynch's -more ""arty""- ""Mullholland drive"". I'd say that ""The Pianist"" reconciles humanist storytelling with cinematic audiovisual poetry, in a way that will be very difficult to outmatch.Maybe that the problem of the movie, which I don't consider as a flaw, is that in the context of modern cinema, ""The Pianist"" may seem weak and flat to the fast movies young addicts created by the movie industry. Those will find in ""Schindler's list"" a more familiar tone, where heroism and human values are portrayed in the Hollywood manipulative fashion that Spielberg masters oh so well. It's a pity, as ""The Pianist"" is a far more authentic and honest work than anything Spielberg will ever be able to achieve. Polanski doesn't want to manipulate us in any way in ""The Pianist"" (though he showed in the past that he's very good with cinematic manipulative tools, think about ""Rosemary's baby""!!), he wants - IMO - to offer us an opportunity to make our own journey through the events shown, leaving just the right amount of space needed for some meditation. He doesn't try to teach us a lesson, he wants us to consider what is being told and make our own opinion about it. This absence of manicheism (no good VS evil here) is one of the most beautiful demonstrations of moral integrity in the history of arts.Oh, well, if your favorite movies ever are Aliens, The Matrix or Gladiator, don't even try ""The Pianist"", you'll be bored to death. Wait for some more years, until your taste adjusts, before meeting this masterpiece.My personal award: on par with any masterpiece of the 7th art, including the very best of Kubrick, Kurosawa, Lynch or the Coen brothers (only to mention a few)."

Vincentiu,"Dec 29, 2011",N/A,"A movie about survive. In dark nuances, with Shoah as scene, in the steps of gorgeous images, a story. A pianist, few miracles and music. A long trip in a large desert. And fear, hope and trust as only protection. It is a biographic piece but it speaks about values. It is a War tall but essence is peace behind reality. And it is a Polanski in which Adrien Brody is brilliant. For the art to discover each color of silent fight. For the strange occasions in which death is expected answer. But the final is a town in ruin, a Nazi officer and a piano. A kind of gift as birth of new time. Precise and not pathetic, harsh and dusty, cruel in a poetic manner, show of a life, it is one precious stone who remembers the respiration of earth and fragility of grass."
gazzo-2,"Sep 3, 2003",8/10,"........I don't have much to add onto what the others here have said-one of the things that struck me was how believable the passing of time. People have slow lives. People have to wait. Refugees hiding in an apt like he was are not exactly racing around to 77 different places in 4 days-they sit, they wait, they hide, they fear that the Nazis will come at any moment, and of course they wait some more. Wars take time. Being forced into a labor camp took time to get thru, slow agonizing months, weeks, days of it. Polanski knows this and shows it. If you want a Michael Bay style MTV jump and cut type editing kinda flick, go elsewheres. This subject matter and this era deserves, merits nothing less than what Polanski gives it.**** believable as anything, kudos to them all for the oscar wins."
johnnyboyz,"May 5, 2008",8/10,"That first scene where Wladyslaw Szpilman (Brody) plays in the recording suite, in Warsaw, for the Polish radio station sums up not only the entire film but Szpilman's dedication and attitude towards his music and his ability to play music. He is sitting there, live on air, as bombs rain down on the city before one hits the building he is in. People are starting to panic behind a soundproof window but it is a suspenseful panic because whilst we in the studio can see the panic and stress the disc jockey is going through, we are tantalisingly put on hold in terms of the horror of the attack. Then a bomb hits the studio room we're in and we wake up to what's happening, as does Szpilman. He must stop playing after previously continuing.The next time Szpilman plays the piano in a war zone where his life is threatened will be the crescendo for not only the Second World Wartime journey of horror Szpilman must endure, but also for the last time danger is that close to him as is a piano. There are scenes in the film where he is so close to a piano and yet playing it would result in his quick demise; but he is strong enough and powerful enough to be able to remember the music and play on through his mind  that adds extra importance to that near-the-end wartime scene when he must play with 'danger' watching on.The film begins and ends in Poland, during the Second World War and we are taken through the various stages of horror imposed by the invading Nazi Germans during their assault on most of mainland Europe. The film's opening third acts not too much like a documentary that might shovel the message: ""The Germans were evil people"" down our throats and not too much like an over the top experimental art film. I read that the film is European produced which should come as no surprise because its aesthetic is very much that of realism, the dominant European aesthetic. So we learn of one family's struggle through the days of the Nazi rule and the film presents us with a hierarchy of Nazi invoked violence. There are the initial scenes of humiliation as a man must walk in the gutter for the crime of being Jewish but there is also the equally awkward to watch as I'm sure it was to shoot scene at a cross roads when Jewish strangers must dance together. From here, the levels are cranked up further and further and it's not long before stone cold violence is being presented to us.But The Pianist is much more than a realistic take on Polish struggles at this time with a few scenes inter-cut to show some atrocity. The film is a breath of fresh air and suggest to me that Roman Polanski has viewed previous Second World War film efforts and corrected them where he thinks corrections should be made. Not a fan of Saving Private Ryan for its lack of mentioning other Allies? Well, Polanski takes time out here for his characters to mention the British and the French over the radio they listen to. Squeamish enough to look away from heavy violence in Second World War films but maintain an interest in the subject anyway? Well here, Polanski shoots his action and his violence in such a way that just these scenes alone go a long way in helping label him an 'auteur'.These scenes and shots are littered throughout the film and contain a certain point of view thinking behind them. For instance, when later on in the film there is guerrilla fighting between Germans and ghetto inhabitants, we always see the action from Szpilman's perspective that is to say the camera never cuts to ground level to show the violence or to try and sell it as entertainment. All we know is that one side is over there, one is over here and they fight; another touch being that for most of the time we do not see the rebels or where they shoot from but we do hear the gunfire. Likewise, when a German soldier is hit the camera never cuts to that level to confirm us the kill  everything is done in point of view format from the window and is kept that way. This gives a scene when Szpilman is actually on the ground level and close to a corpse of a woman he saw get shot a few days ago an extra bite because now we are closer to the kill, it is our first proper look at the result of a gunfight that has been and gone  our conscience and awareness catches up with us.And this tactic is used by Polanski more than once. When a crippled Jew is thrown from his balcony, we see it from the Szpilman's window but when Jews are executed by way of the gun, we are helplessly trapped on that ground level and must witness the atrocity, partly because Szpilman is not there watching from afar in his home or from a window. The added disturbance for these kills is that the cripple cannot defend himself and the fact the officer must reload his gun  also notice how each Jew lying down has their own way of dealing with the inevitable: some keep their face down on the floor but others look ahead giving everything added tragedy. The Pianist works on many levels of storytelling and informs as well as shocks without relying on neatly plotted stories  it is a war fought between superpowers told from the point of view of someone who is not a superpower, and the result is brilliant."

I regret not seeing it sooner and if you haven't seen it, I recommend doing so.Painting a ultra-realistic portrait of one man's life during the darkest period in the 20th century, Polanski masterfully and easily shows what he can do with the right kind of brush I have always enjoyed his films; ""Rosemary's Baby"" being one of my all time favorite movies. But ""The Pianist"" is very different. It is quite serious and disturbing while not being gratuitous. The violence shown here is very sickening but it is never overly graphic. It is not exploitative, as it well shouldn't be. It is heart wrenching to say the least. Adrien Brody confidently commands the respect of the viewer in what has to be the role of his career. He definitely deserved the Oscar he got for this one.In short, every human being alive should see this film. It is unbiased, extremely effective and completely genuine. I never doubted for a moment that Roman's heart wasn't in it. Totally timeless and classic. See it!!!10 out of 10, kids."
sheaulee,"Apr 15, 2003",6/10,"I wasn't planning to see ""The Pianist"". After hearing about the awards and nominations, I  decided to watch it. I don't think that this movie portray the life of ""The Pianist"" and his  compassion for music very well. All I've seen from this film is the brutality of the nazis.  Also, I feel that the emotion and relationship between characters in this film are weakly portrayed. It doesn't show a family relationship. The most important element in this film  wasn't depicted - the pianist's desire and passion for music.This film is very fabricated in its character and story development. I think this movie  depicted the brutality and cruelty of the Nazis very well. However, when it comes to the  connection between characters, story, and emotion, all it showed were montages of  ideas, not a fully developed story."
blott2319-1,"Mar 20, 2020",4/10,"I'm just going to bite the bullet and say something that is potentially quite ugly and offensive, so I'll apologize in advance for how this makes me sound. I've seen enough of the Holocaust. I know it was probably the ugliest and most horrendous moments in humanity's history. I know that Nazis did unspeakably awful things to Jews. I know that life for anyone Jewish was unbearable, for however long they could keep their lives. But over the years I've seen so many films on the subject, my emotional reserves have been used up. I couldn't muster a tear for Wladyslaw Szpilman's struggle, and almost feel like I've become desensitized to scenes of Jews being carted off to concentration camps or shot in the streets. My brain still sees the horror and hates that this was reality, but my heart has been drowned in similar shots in countless movies to the point where it can't continue to break every time I see it. In fact, I just watched a couple of similar films based on the true stories of Jews fleeing the Holocaust within the last month, so perhaps it was just bad timing.I think the other reason that The Pianist didn't connect with me as well as any number of similar stories is the passive role that Szpilman plays in his own story. In many ways he is merely an observer of what happens. His story is about fleeing, watching, and others helping him. Once his family is removed from the equation, we don't form much of a bond with anyone else we see suffering. I'm not suggesting he did anything wrong, in fact his story is quite impressive. However, when I've seen films about people inside the concentration camps, or forced to endure heinous acts of cruelty, it's hard to be as impacted by a guy who is hiding. I hope this doesn't make me sound too much like a monster, and I certainly didn't hate The Pianist. In fact, I was looking forward to hearing him play more, because the actual music was marvelous. It's impossible to be bored by a movie like this, because there's always some new horrible thing around the corner. I guess my standards for movies in this genre have just been raised too much, and it will take something truly original or outstanding to hit me with the power of Holocaust movies that came before."
eike,"Oct 30, 2002",N/A,"This movie is really excellent! Some people here on imdb said, that it's the best movie about the Holocaust, and I have to agree, at least considering all the movies I know. Schindler's List is surely a very good movie, and Spielberg was in my opinion very careful and not very Hollywood-like when handling the topic. But this one seemed to reach a bit deeper.The best scene for me was when Szpilman played for the nazi captain. I don't want to try to find some explanation or so, but this was really ... what it's about to be a human, and what you can't take away by all this cruelness. Some friends said, they found the movie depressing, but I think it's quite the opposite.Some remarks on the reception here in Germany: all the reviews were very good, the cinema I went to was sold out, and the audience obviously was very touched by the movie, staying in their seats until the very end of the closing credits. Unfortunatly, it seems like The Pianist is by far not getting the media attention that Schindler's List had some years ago. So, I assume there will be far less people seeing that movie, though I think it's the better one ..."
jabeone,"Dec 7, 2004",10/10,"It must not only be seen because of the subject that can never be studied enough but because it is perfect in every sense. EVERY SENSE.It is perfect in terms of cinema for the performance of every professional involved in this film.It is perfect in terms of subject treatment because for the first time we get a beginning of an answer to the puzzling question ""how could so many see themselves being slowly tortured and slaughtered, let the horror surround them, without more reaction and hysteria, with so much faith?""In the Polish ghetto, Polanski answers. For the first time, we see the everyday life as an everyday life and not as a drama for the drama necessary to a movie. The film serves these humans' story and not just the contrary.Polanski's film does not want us to cry only. he wants us to wonder, explore and discover. It is dreadfully efficient. He shows that Art that is love is the one link that brings one back from barbary to humankind. Each second of it means a future lifetime for the pianist.Polanski brilliantly illustrates the old idea of Art saving humanity in recent times when it was needed more than ever. In that sense, he helps to save us all. THANK YOU."
Boyo-2,"Apr 17, 2003",10/10,"For maybe the second time in the past twenty years, I am thrilled with the Best Actor winner.  I found Adrien Brody's performance to be pitch-perfect. It reminded me a little of Gregory Peck in ""To Kill a Mockingbird"", who also won.  They shared a quiet intensity, an understated dignity and do not chew on the scenery in an attempt for attention.  Brody's win might signify a maturity among voters, a willingness to honor an actual performance on the screen.  So many people had Jack or Daniel winning, and I congratulate the voters on seeing what Adrien Brody brought to the movie.  Let's face it, with Eminem, Pedro Almovodar and Polanski/Brody winning, it might have been just an atypical year, and next year they can get back to giving awards to non-actors like Julia Roberts and Helen Hunt..I can't honestly say that I've seen another movie like it, even though there have been a slew of movies on the subject.  Several scenes are very intense, but you have to know that going in.Congrats to Roman, too.  If it were up to me, he would have won Best Director for ""Rosemary's Baby"" in 1968.  Maybe his was a we-owe-you Oscar, but given his personal difficulties, I kinda doubt it.10/10."
