eveflower1970,"Dec 28, 2018",9/10,"Two years before Hitchcock's legendary horror movie ""Psycho"" (1960) hit the theaters, our Alfred stunned audiences with another masterpiece. Perhaps not as dark, cruel and shoking as ""Psycho"" (1960) or ""The Birds"" (1963), ""Vertigo"" (1958) still manages to be called a timeless classic.First of all, Scottie's condition allowed the use of an entirely new camera technique. ""The Dolly Zoom"" is one of cinematography's most impressive camera tricks. Years before Steven Spielberg used it in ""Jaws"" (1975), Irmin Roberts was the first cameraman to ever use this technique, in a Hitchcock film.This movie tells the story of Scottie, a retired cop who's asked to investigate the case of his friend's wife, which seems to be possesed by the spirit of a dead young woman who committed suicide.As the chilling story goes on, several moments of suspense accompanied by chilling musical scores are happening. If you're not a fan of it, you can still enjoy the superb settings throughout the movie, and as well the beautifuly filmed shots. These elements alone are a pure work of art in my opinion.Because it's a 50's film, you will encounter extravagant dialogue between the characters, that still manages to look natural. It's not over the top forced as you may see in other films of the era.Toward the end of the movie, I appreciated the interesting depiction of madness that Alfred creates throughout dreams and illusions that our leading man deals with.
The beautiful lighting used in the last half an hour of the movie is also outstanding enough to be mentioned.
And, without spoiling anything, I'd like to mention how from my perspective, the leading man portrayed throughout the movie as a tragic hero, becomes an antagonist.Definetly an unpredictable and stylish classic you don't want to miss."
planktonrules,"Aug 31, 2012",9/10,"It's rather strange that this film was a box office flop, as it's one of Alfred Hitchcock's better movies. The only problem with ""Vertigo"" is that in order to really enjoy it, you need to turn off your brain and just accept the movie. If you think the plot out TOO MUCH, you'll find yourself asking too many questions and not just enjoying the film...like my oldest daughter did.The film is the story of a somewhat creepy ex-cop (James Stewart). When the film begins, he's emotionally scarred in an accident-an accident that leaves him with a HUGE case of psychologically-based vertigo. He decides to quit the job and is soon approached by an old friend--who wants to hire him to follow his emotionally disturbed wife. What happens next is very weird--and later becomes really creepy. I could say A LOT more but think it's best you just see the film--it has quite a few twists and turns that are bound to catch you by surprise.Overall, a wonderfully original film. The only deficit, for some, is that although Stewart was a wonderful actor, he was too old for this role. Still, I could look past this and enjoyed it immensely."
Sethtro,"Sep 7, 2020",7/10,"Personal Rating: 7/10To cut to the chase, this movie didn't live up to my expectations. Coming off the back of 'Dial M for Murder' which I adored, I was excited to watch what critics argue to be the best film of Hitchcock's 'Vertigo', and I'm left feeling disappointed.Why? Why am I not madly in love with the thing the whole world has touted as a masterpiece? The answer lies in the movie's name and one of its many motifs. Vertigo and spirals. This movie gives the viewer a sense of vertigo, packing many many spirals into its 2hr+ runtime so that by the end... are you truly any further than you were at the beginning? Example: Scottie chases ""Madeline"" around town following her, he then receives a piece of information, deepening the plot, and it starts up the next day, following her around. She falls, gets rescued (one of the most talked-about scenes: sexual tension, desire, lust, giving in, disillusionment, the whole shebang) and the following happens again the next day, with yet another piece of information to deepen the plot. Scottie becomes infatuated with ""Madeline"" and we think little of it, just like his going to Ernies and driving down a row of trees but when all of that happens exactly again later in the film more information has been revealed, the stakes are higher. This whole film is a spiral tightening in on itself. I mean the action the movie ends on is the exact action that occurred during the ""climax"" (middle) of the film. Talk about running in circles.The fun thing about circles, is they're great to talk about, just read some of the reviews for this film, essays they really are. People project themselves onto this movie, some apply 21st-century values on this 1958 film, others attempt to see things from Hitchcock's perspective, everything. I'm not saying that's wrong, everyone's entitled to share how they interpret something! But I haven't found someone that just asks, were you satisfied at the end?Perhaps I'm daft, not a true cinema buff, but for a movie to become a personal favourite for me I have to love the story, not just question it.To conclude though, this film in all its other ways is spectacular. The score, beautiful. There's a point where 20 minutes pass with only a few words of dialogue, all you have is the score and it's magnificent. James Stewart and Kim Novak were incredible in their performances, and the cinematography, well, almost hurts how beautiful it is. Jaws eat your heart out, Hitchcock perfected the dolly zoom. And the use of colours (Green & Red), genius.There's no doubt in my mind I will watch this movie again. There are plenty of things done very well, it just is not an enjoyable movie as a whole for myself. Whether you agree or disagree, thanks for reading my review.One is a wanderer; Two together are always going somewhere."
yocarlosvarelapr,"Dec 14, 2017",10/10,"There are no accidents here. Next year, in a few weeks, Vertigo will be 60 years old and it will celebrate it on top of the list of The Greatest Films Ever Made overtaking Citizen Kane and many other masterpieces. Why? Maybe when a filmmaker of Hitchcock's greatness taps into his own unconscious and reveals himself. By now we know enough about Hitchcock the man to know he was obsessed in finding that woman who'll look and behave just the way he wants and once he find them, they are destroyed to then embark on a quest to replace or duplicate her. Vera Miles was suppose to be the object of James Stewart's obsession and she opted for motherhood instead. Kim Novak replaced her and her coldness and detachment worked beautifully here. Barbara Bel Geddes the real woman who loves him he doesn't even notice, his focus is in the impossible.The magic touch in Vertigo is truly Bernard Herrmann. Try to see Vertigo without the score. No, don't. This classic is a marriage of images and music. A thriller with an uncomfortable truth at its very center. A personal truth from its filmmaker. I don't know if Vertigo will still be the number 1 in the list a hundred years from now, I will never know but I suspect that it will always be among the top."
james.king@optusnet.com.au,"Jul 10, 2002",10/10,"Starting in 1958, Alfred Hitchcock directed a remarkable sequence of films in a row, each of them a classic; Vertigo (1958), North by Northwest (1959), Psycho (1960) and The Birds (1963). Never has a director made four such genuinely great movies in such a short space of time, either before or since.The pick of this high standard bunch is undoubtedly Vertigo. From the opening titles, with their circling spiral imagery, to the dramatic final scene this is a movie that takes you to a different time and place. Specifically, to a San Francisco of the past; full of deserted parks, discrete rooming houses, oddly menacing art galleries and florists where the customers enter and exit through the back door. Through this landscape wanders Jimmy Stewart, towering in the lead roll as a former detective recently retired after a bungled arrest leaves him with chronic vertigo. Plot machinations lead him to the alluring Kim Novak (one of Hitchcock's famous ""blondes""), the young wife of a friend who has started behaving rather oddly.""To reveal more,"" as Leonard Maltin wrote, ""would be unthinkable.""While the performances of Novak and Stewart are memorable, the movie is really set apart by the intelligent script and the stylistic touches provided by the director. Hitchcock is in his very best form creating hypnotic scenes and a general sense of unease and dread in even the most banal of situations. He is aided in this by the wonderful score of Bernard Herrman. A particular favourite of mine is the extended (largely silent) segment where Stewart follows Novak for the first time. Nothing much happens, but the atmosphere of these scenes is enough to keep you on the edge of your seat!One of the all-time greats. They definitely don't make them like this anymore."
Snow Leopard,"Jun 19, 2001",N/A,"One of the many things that made Hitchcock such a great director is that he did not just stick to the same formula time after time; all of his best movies have their own unique feel and characteristics.  ""Vertigo"" is particularly distinctive, both as a complex story filled with suspense, and as a fascinating study in psychological tension.  While it lacks the humor of some of Hitchcock's other masterpieces, and sometimes moves rather slowly, it is unforgettable, and a great achievement by the director and his cast.If you have never seen it, you will enjoy it more if you do not know too much about the plot, although the actual story is somewhat secondary to the ways that the characters are tested and their weaknesses exposed by the various events.  Hitchcock uses a complicated story, interesting characters, lavish visual detail, and deliberate pacing, plus a fine musical score by the incomparable Bernard Hermann, to produce a mysterious, almost unearthly, atmosphere.  The tension rarely lets up, and the viewer is caught up completely in it, at times almost to the point of discomfort.  It's the kind of film that repays careful attention, as almost every moment is filled with significant detail.There are also some great acting performances.  Jimmy Stewart is outstanding in a role far different from his usual screen persona.  He enables the viewer to sympathize completely with him, even as we cringe at many of his character's actions and decisions.  Kim Novak is completely convincing in a difficult dual role, and the movie would not have been as compelling without her fine performance.  The rest of the cast all have much smaller roles, but are all quite good too, especially Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's (Stewart's) old friend, who provides important insight into Scottie's character.""Vertigo"" is a classic by any standard.  It's a must-see that remains just as impressive with each viewing."
filipemanuelneto,"May 14, 2016",10/10,"Scottie Ferguson is a police officer, retired because of fear of heights. His life changes when he accepts to watch a woman at the request of her husband, who suspects that his wife has been visited by a ghost. Directed by Alfred Hitchcock, has script Alec Coppel and Samuel A. Taylor, with the participation of James Stewart and Kim Novak.This film is considered by experts one of the best films ever made. I never understood why but, nevertheless, is one of Hitchcock's films that I most like to see. The script is very good, mixing love, obsession, loyalty, madness and mystery in an irresistible recipe that takes the seal of quality of one of the most brilliant masters of suspense in cinema. The ending is baffling. Technically impeccable, this film has an excellent picture, sound effects and a soundtrack where the emphasis is given to the opening theme that, in all fairness, became one of the most famous of Bernard Herrmann. The performance of the actors also deserves congratulations. Stewart shows why Hitchcock was so fond of working with him and Novak can perfectly be, at the same time, the damsel in distress and the femme fatale, who leads men to act without thinking.Essential for all Hitchcock fans, this film is a must-see for any lover of suspense and mystery. It's a film that can be seen by teenage audiences, despite having some more dramatic scenes, and probably will please the majority of audiences."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jul 19, 2009",10/10,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is a San Francisco cop who decides to quit the service after his acrophobia results in him being unable to save the life of a colleague. Whilst taking it easy he gets a call from an old school friend, Gavin Elster, asking him if he wouldn't mind doing a little bit of detective work for him. The job is simply to tail his wife because she's obsessed with an ancestress who committed suicide, and the wife, Madeline, is showing signs of herself being suicidal. Ferguson tails her diligently and as the tail progresses, Ferguson himself starts to become ever obsessed about the demur blonde Madeline. As the story twists and turns, Ferguson's obsession will have far reaching consequences for both parties...Vertigo is Alfred Hitchcock's most discussed, dissected and critically reappraised film, based on a novel by Pierre Boileau called D'Entre Les Morts, (also writer of Diabolique), Vertigo was not well liked on its release and unable to be viewed for some time due to copyright, the film was restored from a destroyed negative into a glorious 70mm print, and now in all its glory it can be seen as one of the greatest films to have ever been made. What is most striking about Vertigo, outside of Hitchcock baring his innermost that is, is that its plot on the surface is simplicity personified, but delving deeper, and repeat viewings are a necessity, its apparent that Vertigo is a chilling force of cinema, taking great delight in gnawing away at your perceptions, perhaps even your own capabilities as a human being.Very much a film of two great halves, Vertigo first seems intent on being an almost ghost story like mystery. Once the prologue has introduced us to Ferguson's fear of heights, we then enter an almost dream like sequence of events as Ferguson tails the troubled Madeline, the suggestion of reincarnation bleakly leading to death hangs heavy as Hitchcock pulls his atmospheric strings. Then the film shifts into dark territory as obsessions and nods to Dante's Inferno and feverish dreams take control, Hitchcock, as we have come to learn over the years, lays out his soul for us the audience to partake in, the uneasy traits sitting side by side with fascination of the story. All of which is leading us to a spine tingling finale that is as hauntingly memorable as it is shocking, the end to our own dizzying journey that Alfred and his team have taken us on.Technically the film is magnificent, the opening credits from Saul Bass brilliantly prep us for what is about to unfold, while Bernard Herrmann's score is as good as anything he ever did, unnerving one minute, swirlingly romantic the next, a truly incredible score. Hitchcock himself is firing from the top draw, introducing us to the brilliant zoom-forward-track-back camera technique to induce the feeling of Vertigo itself, with that merely a component of two hours of gorgeous texture lined with disturbing little peccadilloes. The two leads are arguably doing their respective career best work, James Stewart as Scottie Ferguson goes real deep to play it out with an edgy believability that decries his aw-shucks trademark of years since past. Kim Novak as Madeline is perhaps the quintessential Hitchcock blonde, perfect with the duality aspects of the role and playing off Stewart's ever creepy descent with seamlessly adroit skill. It however should be noted that Hitchcock and his loyal subjects had to work hard to get Novak right for the role, but the result proves that Novak had ability that sadly wasn't harnessed on too many other occasions.Vertigo is a film that I myself wasn't too taken with on my first viewing, it's only during revisits that the piece has come to grab me by the soul and refuse to let go, it not only holds up on revisits, it also gets better with each subsequent viewing, it is simply a film that demands to be seen as many times as possible. Not only one of the greatest American films ever made, one of the greatest films ever made...period, so invest your soul in it, just the way that Hitchcock himself so clearly did. 10/10"
Lord_Borrington,"Aug 1, 2017",9/10,"Not very popular with critics or audiences when it first came out, probably not what they were expecting form the master director. Certainly a very different movie not in the usual Hitchcock formula. The movie probably needs more than one viewing. I can understand why some people don't like it much, but if you can get into the mood and atmosphere it's a surreal masterpiece. The movie is really about creating a surreal dreamlike world to enter. Set in San Francisco in 1958 it is like nothing before or since. Unforgettable and mesmerizing it is full of great locations, strange characters and stories. We go on a strange uneasy journey with Jimmy Stewart where there is no return and end up somewhere between sanity and insanity. Everything about this movie goes together to create another world which you feel like you have entered, the music, the 1950s grainy film, the dull colours, the incredibly shot locations, the changing light. It is certainly a strange movie hard to put into a box. It is from another time. Amazing. Like a dream... A classic film from the golden age of Hollywood. A Hollywood which doesn't exist anymore. There is just something about this movie, which you can't put your finger on. It's full of secrets."
legend21,"Oct 25, 2005",10/10,"Over the years, this film has been regarded as one of Hitchcock's masterpieces. Its been called the most personal, emotional, and complex of Hitchcock's films. I agree with all of these things except for one, this film IS Hitchcock's masterpiece work. All of the others pale in comparison to this. There are phenomenal performances here by Jimmy Stewart who plays the biggest anti-hero of his career and Kim Novak whose stunning beauty and exceptional personalities shine through this dark film. Barbara Bel Geddes provides great support as well. Everything about this film, the cinematography, the story, the depth, etc. leaves you mystified and transfixed on this dizzying, surreal artwork of a film. It truly is flawless. If you are a Hitchcock fan and haven't seen this you need to get up right now and buy, not rent, this as soon as possible!"
AlsExGal,"Nov 21, 2009",10/10,"... and perhaps that is why it bombed upon initial release.When Vertigo was first released in 1957, it was not that popular in theaters and was pretty much universally panned by critics. In 1992, when the British Film Institute performed a survey of the world film critics to compile an all-time ten-best list that comes out every decade, Vertigo came in at fourth place. It didn't even make that list in 1962 or 1972. Part of the reason for the delayed popularity of the film could be that it requires repeated viewings to really gain an appreciation of it. Such repeated viewings were not possible for most viewers until the advent of home video systems and cable around 1980.It is unusual to see a director produce his best work after the age of 50, but that is exactly what Alfred Hitchcock did. Starting in 1948 with ""Rope"" and ending with ""The Birds"" in 1963, this was the era of his most inspired films. ""Vertigo"", in my opinion, is the best film of his entire body of work.As for the film itself, it is a brilliantly twisted movie infused with touches of genius and madness that focuses on the interconnected nature of love and obsession. Interwoven with this main theme is a crime mystery that is revealed to and solved for the audience but not the protagonist, James Stewart's character, for the last 45 minutes of the film.Alongside these themes is the issue of lost opportunities - how we grieve over them, and whether or not what we perceive as lost opportunities were ever ""real"" opportunities in the first place. This issue is raised not only for Scotty (James Stewart), but for just about everybody else in the cast too. This includes Scotty's college girlfriend (Barbara Bel Geddes) who has remained his friend through the years and obviously still harbors thoughts of what might have been if only she had accepted Scotty's marriage proposal years before.Besides the excellent acting and superb plot, the score is outstanding as is the cinematography, especially the visual darkness of the mission San Juan Bautista versus the angelic beauty of Madeleine which belies what is really going on. I highly recommend this film to anyone who has the time to watch it more than once. Just one viewing won't do it justice."
The_Sun_Toucher,"Jul 6, 2000",10/10,"The Cinema is often referred to as an Art form, although only a handful of films actually live up to that ideal.  most films, even great ones, are extremely forgettable to all but the most die hard movie buffs. Which is why Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is such a breath of fresh air.  Here is a subtle, suspensful, mezmerising tale told with the patience and sure handedness of a true artist.  At it's heart Vertigo is a tale of deception and obsession.  After the brilliantly exciting opening sequence (which has been ripped off countless times, like much of Al's catalogue) the movie slows down to a steady, almost frustrating pace.  It's main theme develops only gradually, allowing the viewer to soak in every tiny detail of character development. I fear, however, that this film may be too subtle and cerebral for most of today's action obsessed movie buffs, but for those viewers with a little bit of patience and just a drop of thoughtfulness, ""Vertigo"" will prove a very rewarding experience."
XRANDY,"Aug 2, 2001",N/A,"An interesting psychological piece that richly displays Hitchcock's talents.  It is unfair to compare this film to the suspense thrillers of today which are subjected to more realism in sex and violence.  Hitchcock had to be more subtle in 1958, where I'm sure a work like this, that seems tame by today's standards, appeared bizarre and risqué.  Also the acting here seems histrionic; not that people actually spoke like that in the 50s but the audiences liked such dictionally refined dialogue back then as opposed to the lines of modern-day scripts that more accurately portray the way individuals speak.James Stewart and Kim Novak are appealing on numerous levels, the former mainly because he doesn't wander far from the amiable joe we have come to expect (even though he does weird-out near the conclusion) and the latter because she maintains a veneer of vulnerability that we can relate to.This is not a film I especially like (I couldn't watch it again and again) but I respect for its strong filmmaking."
AaronCapenBanner,"Oct 13, 2013",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this mesmerizing film that stars Jimmy Stewart as John 'Scottie' Ferguson, a retired San Francisco policeman who is approached by old college friend Gavin Elster(played by Tom Helmore) who wants him to follow his wife Madeline(played by Kim Novak) who has been acting strangely. Scottie does follow her, and becomes obsessed by her beauty and behavior, eventually falling in love with her, with devastating consequences. Though that is only the start of the mystery... Barbara Bel Geddes costars as Scottie's friend Midge, still in love with him, despite jilting him years before. Superbly directed and acted film has an ingenious story and stunning imagery, making this an unforgettable romantic mystery, with a stunning ending...though if you have the DVD, watch the extra feature on the lost extended ending, which is fascinating, and changes the tone of the film as a result!"
benyox2803,"Sep 13, 2013",7/10,"Though I enjoyed this film I think at times it can be overrated by various critics and members of the public. I would recommend it to a friend but only as a solid film and not 'a timeless classic' as it is often called.The ending of the film is certainly very striking and memorable and was a well done climax after a pretty average build up. The music used really adds to shock value of the ending.The characters in this film are what let's this film down the most. Most of the acting is wooden and not believable whatsoever. James Stewart is hopeless as the lead character and really drags the film down with a performance that could send anyone to sleep. Other supporting actors are 'ok' but none will leave you amazed and none are memorable bar the one saving grace in the cast Kim Novak; She is fantastic in her dual roles as Madeline and Judy and her performance will grip you and added to the feelings of shock and sadness I felt at the ending.Hitchcock is superb as Director as always. The way the film is made; from every camera angle to every sound you hear creates suspense and anticipation. The build-up to the climax is done very well and the climax itself executed to a good standard.Though well-made it is not 'perfect' and the first part of the film probably over did it when trying to create suspense and was in all honestly, a bit boring. If the pacing to the first half was altered slightly and Stewart had put a little more effort in this could have been near perfect."
CGarcia-2,"Aug 25, 1999",10/10,"I have seen ALOT of movies in my life, but none have moved me the way Vertigo has...It's simply brilliant...the more times one views it, the more one picks up from it...a true masterpiece from the master himself...When I think Vertigo, I think the colors red and green...when I think Vertigo I think obsession with love, and the film itself...This movie is so deep that you could write a thesis on it and keep adding to it from time to time...Hitchcock really gave his all in this picture...it's about the ultimate love...wanting to achieve the ultimate love, and, as happens in life, never having love turn out to be the way we want it to be...all star performances by Stewart, Novak and Bel Geddes make this visually stunning masterpiece a true film classic...Newly restored, the DVD version simply blows you out of the water....I have seen the movie about 20 times now, and everytime I love it more...Vertigo is the ultimate cult film for me, as I keep going back to it more and more...considering it's dark storyline, it must be a glut for punishment, but Hitch only keeps me wanting more....10 stars...only because I can't give it 100 stars!"
TimelessFlight,"Jun 9, 2023",6/10,"A lowly 6/10? I know that will be seen as sacrilege by those that rate this to be Hitch's 10/10 masterpiece, but as many times as I see this film and as many times as I want to like it, I just cannot get overly enthused.The premise of the film is a very good one . . . Madeleine (Kim Novak), the wife of a wealthy businessman, is acting very strangely - apparently lost in a past woman's life, mentally troubled and disappearing at times. He asks his friend Scottie (James Stewart) to follow her and work out what she is up to. We follow Scottie following Madeleine, and are invited to work out what is going on in Madeleine's mind.Madeleine and Scottie's relationship develops (unconvincingly for me) until a key moment in the film that on first viewing might seem like the film's concluding scene. In fact, that dramatic moment is just an excellent twist and the beginning of 'part two' of the movie, a part that further explains who Madeleine is, whether Scottie can come to terms with his own issues and what was happening all along.So, a potentially fascinating psychological story based on deception, suspense and intrigue with a terrific plot twist, by one of the the world's greatest directors who's films I adore - what's not to love? Well, for me quite a bit.The early scenes where Scottie follows Madeleine are necessary to the story but really very dull. Slow is fine, but slow and boring isn't. Then there's Kim Novak playing Madeleine - some say she gives the performance of a lifetime, but I found her performance as dull as dishwater; the most memorable part of her performance was the astonishingly distracting false eyebrows. Finally, while the superior 'part two' of the film elevates the movie considerably, the actual ending - as in the last minute or so of the film - just seems too ridiculous.I respect and understand entirely those who see this as Hitch's psychological masterpiece, and I wish I could join them and get the same pleasure from the film. Sadly there are just too many flat spots, over dramatisations and unbelievable characters for me to get past. At least Hitch has left us with an interesting debate.Good, not great."
Infofreak,"Jan 15, 2003",N/A,"I get a bit tongue-tied talking about Hitchcock's greatest movies because they are just so remarkable, so astonishing, so entertaining, so multi-levelled, that it's very difficult to put into words what makes them great. Hitchcock made some of the greatest movies ever made, and 'Vertigo', though by no means his most accessible film, is quite possibly his crowning achievement. It is without any doubt a masterpiece, and I cannot fault it in any way. Every time I watch it I am knocked out, and every time I see something new, some nuance or moment that I appreciate more than I did the previous viewing. Jimmy Stewart, one of the most popular movie star in Hollywood history, gives a remarkable performance throughout, one of the best in his career. Stewart had worked with Hitchcock before, and had always been superb, especially in the much copied suspense classic 'Rear Window' a few years prior to this, but he plays against type in 'Vertigo' and is jaw-droppingly good. It's difficult to remember now that 'Vertigo' is regarded as a movie milestone, that it received many bad reviews when it was originally released, and was a relative failure for Hitchcock. A lot of this had to do with Stewart's intense performance I think, and also the difficult subject matter. 'Vertigo' is essentially a tale of sexual obsession, something most people were probably not expecting at the time! Almost as good as Stewart is Kim Novak ('The Man With The Golden Arm') in a role that she will always be remembered for. 'Vertigo' is a virtuoso piece from Hitchcock, and a movie that will no doubt continue to inspire other film makers over the years to come. However the most important thing about it is that it is still  wonderful viewing, and a movie experience that you will never forget. In my mind it is one of the three of four greatest American movies. Simply astonishing."
ags123,"Dec 10, 2014",10/10,"Once you've seen ""Vertigo"" you can almost see the whole thing again in your head. Its haunting images stay with you. Whatever else you might say about ""Vertigo,"" (and there are those who don't like it), it's unquestionably a visually beautiful film. It formed my impressions of San Francisco, and when I finally visited that city, it all seemed so familiar. In fact, many of the locations remain unchanged after more than fifty years - Mission Dolores, The Brocklebank Apartments, The Legion of Honor, The Palace of Fine Arts, Fort Point. You can even stay in the same Sutter Street hotel where ""Judy"" lived (The Empire Hotel is now the Hotel Vertigo). If I can find fault at all with this film, I point to James Stewart who, despite a great performance, looks too old for the part and his chemistry with Kim Novak is dubious (Much better in their other 1958 outing, ""Bell, Book and Candle""). When ""Vertigo"" failed at the box office on its initial release, Hitchcock is said to have blamed it on Stewart, and I tend to believe it. After four films together, he never used him again. Nevertheless, ""Vertigo"" entertains on many levels. I don't even mind the unexplained and illogical sequences (Madeleine waking up nude in Scottie's bed and neither one of them making an issue of it; her disappearance from The McKittrick Hotel). And I'm impressed by the downbeat and abrupt ending, which surely was unusual for a Hollywood film at that time. ""Vertigo"" is in a class by itself."
lastliberal,"Feb 7, 2008",9/10,"Oscar ignored this fantastic film by Hitchcock starring James Stewart. It gave nomination for Art and Set decoration and Sound. Small acknowledgment of an outstanding film.James Stewart was outstanding as a detective that was duped by his ""friend (Tom Helmore)."" We were all led on an adventure that made absolutely no sense until we were shown the result. This film really had me going! Kim Novak was also excellent in her role as the wife. She was so good that I had no idea that she was anything more than object of Stewart's obsession. Hitchcock had me going her also.This was an excellent movie and should have had more recognition."
Goodbye_Ruby_Tuesday,"Dec 21, 2006",10/10,"John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart, never better) is a retired detective with a severe fear of heights after a botched chase to capture a criminal. Due to his newly acquired acrophobia, he retires and wanders around the beautiful streets of San Francisco. Out of the blue, an old college friend Gavin Elster asks him to follow his wife Madeleine, as he believes that Madeleine may be possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, drifting in and out of reality and into trance-like states of mind. So Scottie agrees to follow the mysterious blonde (Kim Novak) as Hitchock guides us throughout San Francisco and into his strange and dark mind. Little by little, Scottie begins to become infatuated with Madeleine, and after he saves her from suicide (she jumped into San Francisco Bay) and decides to help her, he falls madly in love with her. In finding pieces of the puzzle to Madeleine's mystery, their journey takes them to the San Juan Bautista where Madeleine meets her end by tumbling off the bell tower, presumably by suicide. Scottie tried to save his love but his fear of heights stopped him. For the next year Scottie falls into a deep depression, feeling guilty for his impotency to save his love. His depression is halted when he sees Judy Barton (Novak again). Judy isn't like Madeleine--she's plain, in touch with reality and even vulgar when compared. But her face looks so much like Madeleine. Scottie begins to court Judy first for herself but eventually he tries to mold her into the beauty he lost prematurely, unaware that Judy has a big secret up her sleeve.When it was first released, Vertigo didn't get good reviews and it didn't make money at the box office. People didn't understand the bizarre dream sequences that were so ahead of their time, they didn't feel sympathy for the characters (at the end, even Scottie is unlikable), and the BIG TWIST is given away in the middle of the movie instead of at the end, a la Psycho. Even I had my complaints about that last one, yet after a second viewing I realized that this movie wasn't even about what really happened to what really happened to Madeleine; it's about men's psychological--and sexual--desire for the perfect woman, even if she's out of touch with reality. This movie is considered Hitchcock's most personal film, as he could be domineering with his actresses, trying to mold them into his own dream. After the ""failure"" of Vertigo, Hitchcock never worked with Jimmy Stewart again, unfairly blaming him for not being able to draw a crowd on account of his age. Luckily for everyone, Vertigo has gotten better with age and is no longer forgotten. In the late 80s Vertigo started popping up on Top 10 Films of All Time lists, and today it's considered Hitchock's best film, and most definitely one of the best ever made.The biggest reason for Vertigo's late success is because it is Hitchcock's most analyzed film and because it works on a psychological level; The film points out that men would rather have an unavailable, beautiful woman who is out of touch with reality than a woman who understands her surroundings and is utterly available. This is pointed out twice, once with Midge, an ex-fiancée and good friend of Scottie and later with Judy, who tries to make Scottie love her for who she is and not because she reminds Scottie of Madeleine. The first hour is drawn out very slowly, and while it's not as fast-paced as other Hitchcock's films, he uses it wisely. He starts by first gaining--later testing--our sympathy for Scottie; when he's hanging for his dear life in the opening scene, we pray for him (even though we know that there would be no movie if Jimmy Stewart dies in the first 3 minutes). When he's chasing Madeleine up the bell tower, we hope that he can get there in time and kiss his lover. And when the romance turns dark in the second outing to the bell tower, you feel just as caught in the middle as Scottie does in that moment. Hitchcock blurred the lines between victim and villain, and he earns our creative respect for him.The key element to why Vertigo works so well in the end is because of the actors. It's practically impossible to think of anyone other than James Stewart, who embodied the everyman, and for that reason is so convincing in testing our sympathies. It's all in the minimalistic ways he does it, with the slightest crinkle in the forehead or the movement in the eyes doing evoking more emotion than most actors do screaming and crying. This is his best performance next to Mr. Smith Goes to Washington. And Kim Novak is ravishing and haunting both as Madeleine and Judy, utterly convincing in both roles. With my respects to Grace Kelly, Novak just may be the most mysterious and convincing Hitchcock blonde to grace the screen. Their chemistry together, despite their age difference is explosive and natural.Buy--don't rent--this DVD and you'll find yourself falling for every detail of this brilliant film."
Hitchcoc,"May 5, 1999",10/10,"Having experienced vertigo myself, the dizzying, confusing, frightening mind spinning, ""think you're going to die"" kind of feeling, I can empathize with the Jimmie Stewart protagonist.  Make him a hero who has enough hangups from trauma to last a lifetime.  Put into the plot a series of misrepresentations of fact and you have this movie.  I think what I like the most is that we have this man trying to put his life together, but he doesn't know what to do to make it work.  He also is deep in depression, caused by personal loss. Along comes Kim Novak, the carbon copy of his lost love.  He falls into a sick reconstruction of his past life, but the fear is still there and won't go away until he is able to confront his ghosts.  Once again, the Hitchcock hero fumbles his way along, trying to discover while being pursued.  There is that threat there all the time.  The cinematography is excellent.  The method used to show the feeling he gets when he looks down, is pure genius. The framing of scenes. The stairway in the tower. The scenes by the bay. Novak's ""coming out"" is really spooky, so captivating and yet unsettling. The true test of a movie, for me, is always going to be that there is something to see after several viewings.  Hitchcock's films, especially the really good ones, allow me a lifetime of rediscovery; I feel that directors like Hitchcock are a gift to humanity.  This film is one of the reasons I feel this way."
dbdumonteil,"Aug 12, 2001",10/10,"In Boileau-Narcejac's French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""= from among the Dead""),the revelation only comes in the last pages,but Hitchcock lets the cat out of the bag long before the end. Boileau-Narcejac's novel is a pure detective story,but the Master wanted more:the movie already outdistances the book in a first part visually wonderful,with memorable scenes,wrapped in mystery ,such as the one with the sequoia,symbol of immortality or the one down by the sea,to rival with the best romantic movies of all time.In the second part,Hitchcock explains in the Truffaut's book,we know but Scottie( James Stewart) does not .And he tries to recreate a dead woman,to transform Judy into Madeleine.This folie à deux ends where the first tragedy occurred ,which gives the movie a strength that the book had not.Read it and you'll realize how its end ,speaking in terms of cinema,had to be modified for the screen.That's Hitchcock's genius.When Boileau/Narcejac learned that Hitchcock wanted to transfer ""Celle Qui N'Etait PLus "" (=les Diaboliques"" )to the screen,they immediately wrote ""D'Entre les Morts "" on the same pattern for Hitchcock to direct."
MaximillianZeus,"Apr 9, 2025",6/10,"Vertigo is often spoken of in hushed tones, revered as one of Hitchcock's great masterpieces, held up as a psychological labyrinth of obsession and identity. And walking into it, I was genuinely excited. The opening half lured me in with mystery and atmosphere, the kind of intrigue Hitchcock is so known for. The cinematography is drop-dead gorgeous. From sweeping shots of San Francisco to the dizzying, now-iconic dolly zoom that visually embodies the sensation of vertigo, it's a film that practically invented visual language for psychological discomfort. The sets feel lived-in and cinematic at once, and Bernard Herrmann's haunting score pulls you into this swirling descent from the very first frame.James Stewart gives a solid, committed performance-there's something deeply uneasy about his portrayal of Scottie, an ex-cop who starts off slightly pathetic and ends up completely unhinged. Kim Novak does what she can with a role that's more archetype than person, a mannequin to be manipulated, which, I suppose, is partly the point.But as the story unfolds, it began to lose me-not just gradually, but spectacularly. The premise, initially gripping, begins to veer off into the absurd. Characters start behaving like they've been plucked from a soap opera or a dream logic script that doesn't quite know how to balance tone. The reveal, which is supposed to be devastating, felt unintentionally cartoonish to me. I didn't feel a creeping horror or emotional impact. I felt confused and weirdly detached. It's not that the film is difficult-it's that it seems to think it's saying something profound while telling a story that, on paper, starts to sound ridiculous the more you think about it.By the time we reach the tower again in the final moments, I wasn't shocked. I wasn't moved. I was mostly just waiting for it to end.So yes, it's beautiful. It's influential. It's incredibly well crafted. But I can't shake the feeling that its psychological weight is often overstated. For all its technical brilliance, it spiraled into something I couldn't quite take seriously. And once I stopped taking it seriously, it had nothing left to offer me."
TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 24, 2009",10/10,"I am a massive Hitchcock fan; this great director ain't called the Master of Suspense for nothing. Anyway, Vertigo is one of the truly great Hitchcocks. It is a thriller of undeniable complexity not only in plot but also in characterisation. It is implausible too i give you that. I will admit the first time I saw this, I didn't understand this, then again this is the sort of film that you need to see more than once. In all departments, this movie is a masterpiece and my all time favourite Hitchcock. For those who say this is the worst movie ever, you would beg to differ if you saw genuine crapfests like Disaster Movie, Home Alone 4, NeverEnding Story 3 and Superbabies:Baby Geniuses 2. They are a trillion times worse than this without a shadow of a doubt.What makes this movie great? When I re watched this, I got goosebumps. It is quite chilling, suspenseful and extremely haunting. The complex plot tells of a retired cop with a terror of heights who is hired by Gavin Elster to follow his suicidal wife. In the end, he falls in love with her but can't stop her falling to her death. Months later he sees a woman bearing strong resemblance to her, and is drawn into a web of deceit and obsession. There are so many strong moments here, especially Scotty following Madeline up the tower only to witness her falling to her death, but also of the San Francissco locations giving a dreamlike quality to an already dark and complex movie. The screenplay is sophisticated and sharp as well. And I have to mention Bernard Hermann's score, it was phenomenal, along with Miklos Rosza's score for Spellbound and Hermann's for Psycho this is the most memorable score in any Hitchcock film, and is guaranteed to have your hairs standing up on the back of your necks.The direction from Hitchcock is simply masterly. The cinematography isn't dated at all. It is stylish and full of contrasts of dark and bright colours, and is also very brooding and intense. I had very little problem with the film's pace and length; in fact let me rephrase that I had no problem with it. I felt actually that Torn Curtain had a much slower pace, and for me that film while good is one of my least favourite Hitchcock movies. The acting I thought was exceptional. Kim Novak starts off a little wooden, but she is certainly very beautiful and enigmatic. In the duel role of the suicidal wife and the woman bearing resemblance to her, she does an in general excellent job, considering both are extremely demanding roles. About James Stewart, whether he was a racist I don't know, but simply I don't care. Whether you are racist or not, it shouldn't matter when it comes to acting and films. What matters is that Stewart was a great actor who rarely gave a bad performance. In this film, he gives one of his best performances, shattering his Mister-Nice-Guy persona with a dark, brooding and truly complex characterisation. Barbara Bel Geddes also gives a terrific performance as Midge.All in all, a superb film, that deserves recognition as one of Hitchcock's best films. Seriously, it is one of the most effective depictions of romantic fatalism in all of cinema. An unforgettable masterpiece, 10/10 Bethany Cox"
BA_Harrison,"Sep 26, 2013",5/10,"Although often regarded as one of Hitchcock's finest thrillers, Vertigo failed to impress me as much as I had hoped. There are the expected Hitchcock visual flourishes (plus one really trippy scene that is downright freaky), the dreamlike score by Bernard Hermann is suitably eerie, and Barbara Bel Geddes plays a fun character, but most other aspects of this so-called classic left me cold.James Stewart is rather wooden in his role but is suitably matched by Kim Novak, whose pencilled eyebrows have more screen presence than the rest of her (not surprising given how huge they are!); Hitch must have been directing on Valium, such is the slowness of the pace; and the story is really mundane, with little in the way of excitement or suspense save for the opening rooftop chase scene. Quite what other Hitchcock fans are raving about when they claim this is amongst his best work is beyond me—I struggled to stay awake."
Quinoa1984,"Feb 13, 2000",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo is probably his most discussed film, and I believe that since it is so controversial- and yet living up to such hype by having a level of mystery, daring and true human interest that is open to interpretation- it gets better with every passing year. It deserves more credit than it gets (like most of Hitchcock's films) and though it is well credited with it's intrigue, I think that Psycho (not that it is a bad film) gets more credit than this film should get. There are at least a few reasons for this, arguably of course. One, the acting is spectacular including James Stewart in one of his very best turns as the weary, emotionally perplexed and obsessed cop with a slight fear of heights and a 'thing' for a certain 'dead' woman. Hitchcock's leading lady here Kim Novak, is equally interesting and ambiguous as the leading lady (or ladies).Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images and dark scenes come into great view. Not one of the more outright 'fun' Hitchcock films, with the few chuckles plain comic relief, and maybe his best serious work. A++"
rbrb,"Apr 29, 2004",10/10,"Retired detective, who is scared of heights, is hired to follow another mans wife and there follows intrigue, mystery and suspense. A super melodrama! The acting,directing, sets, costumes, script, music, etc are all excellent. And near the start of the film there is one brilliant 10 minute period when there is no dialogue but the action is controlled only by the music. A sensational analysis of the movie is by Roger Ebert: see external reviews. This picture is worthy of maximum marks."
hwm-05554,"Sep 2, 2020",6/10,"There are many Hitchcock films that I really enjoyed watching but ""Vertigo"" is not one of them. Many parts of the plot are unnecessary or not clear at all:1. At the beginning of the film, was he really hanging from that rooftop? Was he saved? How was he saved? It seemed impossible that he was saved since he had a ""Vertigo"" and no help was no near. But somehow the movie continues without explaining how
he survived or who saved him.2. The character Midge Wood (ex-fiancée) gets introduced to the story. Midway through the film she leaves the film and we never hear from her again. What was the point of her being in the movie in the first place? Did Hitchcock really need this person to exist so that the protagonist can explain to the audience what being afraid from heights means?This list could be larger but I think I made my point clear. This movie contains lots of unnecessary elements and the pacing of the plot was too slow for my taste. I want to end this review though by praising the protagonist' acting. Strong performance from James Stewart!"

evanston_dad,"Sep 12, 2006",9/10,"Considered by many to be Hitchcock's masterpiece, ""Vertigo"" may be tough to warm up to on a first viewing. It's an enigmatic and extremely slow-moving film, and it feels personal in ways that many of Hitchcock's other, more playful movies don't. You get the sense that Hitch is working through his personal demons on screen -- the fetishes and obsessions that played such a major role in so many of his films leading up to ""Vertigo"" feel like characters in and of themselves here.James Stewart delivers a frightening performance as a man who plunges into a world of weird sexual obsession when a woman with whom he's formed a romantic attachment dies (or seems to). He finds another woman who looks amazingly like the first, and proceeds to force a complete physical makeover on her in an attempt to recreate his former love. Kim Novak plays the two women in her typical icy fashion; for once, her stilted, awkward acting works for a role and comes off as an attribute rather than a liability.In its new remastered life on DVD, ""Vertigo"" looks stunning. San Francisco and its surroundings are bathed in ethereal, dream-like lighting, and Hitchcock pays more attention to art direction and the use of color than he ever had previously. Also, there's that amazing swirling Bernard Herrmann score that haunts the film, and accompanies one of the most memorable opening credits sequences ever filmed.There are still a number of other Hitchcock films I would rather watch before ""Vertigo,"" and many others that I would qualify as much more fun, but I can't deny that this one certainly has an allure.Grade: A"
ThomasDrufke,"Aug 13, 2016",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock wowed audiences for decades with an immense talent of deception and artistic flare, and perhaps no movie was a better showcase for those talents than his 1958 hit Vertigo. An impressive tale about obsession.In honor of Alfred Hitchcock's birthday, I decided to re-watch Vertigo and reevaluate just how well it holds up upon repeated viewings. There's nothing quite like the shock of watching it for the first time, but I had a chance to dig my teeth into the legendary performances of James Stewart and Kim Novak while being dazzled by Hitchcock's meticulously crafted story.One of the most impressive aspects about Vertigo is that it's clearly framed as a story about someone with Vertigo dealing with a peculiar case, but really, it's about obsession, and a man digging just a little bit too deep into a case. A theme that Christopher Nolan seemed to take into his film, Memento, in 2000. Vastly different stories, but similar execution from the director's chair.An easy way to identify a film's tone is through the score, and Hitchcock always seemed to get the best out of the legend, Bernard Herrmann. His score here is both haunting and alluring. I love the way he balanced the score with the uncomfortable feeling we get as an audience watching Stewart's character obsess, along with the noir- ish love story that forms as well.Amidst Hitchcock's mind boggling story are a few darn good performances by Stewart and Novak. Stewart, typically known strictly in likable protagonist roles, finds himself in a more complex and even unlikable alley. There's certainly times where the lines between protagonist and antagonist are blurred, but Stewart does a great job at rounding out his character. Novak, on the other-hand, plays a more mysterious role but nonetheless just as significant. Aside from the characters in Psycho, Novak may have had the most difficult time portraying just who Hitchcock desired for this role. If there was ever a Hitchcock blonde who deserved a Best Actress Oscar, I think it was Novak.Overall, Vertigo holds up just as well as the first time I watched it, and perhaps even better in some aspects. There's a reason this film is at the top of so many greatest films of all time lists.+Hitchcock's colorful direction+Stewart and Novak were at the top of their game+Herrmann's score+Themes still hold up10/10"
claudio_carvalho,"Dec 5, 2009",10/10,"While pursuing a criminal on the roofs of the buildings in San Francisco, Detective John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) has a severe trauma when his partner falls off the roof trying to save him. He suffers from acrophobia and is retired from the police force, since his fear of heights provokes vertigo on him. He is contacted by the former mate from college Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), who runs the shipyard of his wife Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), and Gavin asks him to follow his wife. Gavin explains that she has an odd behavior and seems to be possessed by the spirit of Carlotta Valdes, having blanks of memory every now and then and presenting suicidal tendencies. The skeptical Scottie follows the beautiful blonde on the next morning: she buys some flowers and is drawn to places from the past related to Carlotta Valdes, visiting her grave in an ancient cemetery; staring her portrait for a long time in a museum; and finally moving to the Hotel McKittrick where Carlotta lived. In the end of the day, Scottie reports his findings to Gavin. When Madeleine jumps in the water of San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and brings her home. He has a crush on her and they fall in love for each other. When they go together to a mission outside San Francisco, Madeleine runs to the bell tower of the church and the disabled Scottie is unable to reach her; she jumps off the tower, committing suicide. There is a trial and the traumatized Scottie is interned with a breakdown. When he is discharged from the hospital, he meets the brunet seller Judy Barton by chance and her resemblance with Madeleine is amazing. Scottie approaches to Judy and expect to have a second chance in love until he sees a souvenir of a killing.""Vertigo"" is a masterpiece of obsession by Alfred Hitchcock. The timeless complex story is perfect and full of suspense and psychological and sexual tensions. Kim Novak is extremely sexy and has an extraordinary performance in her double role and James Stewart is awesome as usual performing a charismatic character that becomes obsessed when he sees Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes performs an important support character that helps to develop James Stewart's character. The open conclusion is also excellent and the music score is also spectacular and gives a suspenseful touch of class to this film. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is walking in front of the entrance of the shipyard carrying what seems to be a musical instrument. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Um Corpo que Cai"" (""A Body that Falls"")Note: On 11 November 2024, I saw this film again."
lauraeileen894,"Sep 18, 2005",10/10,"No Alfred Hitchcock film has been picked at, dissected, debated, and analyzed as much as ""Vertigo"". There's good reason: ""Vertigo"" has the most complex and surreal storyline of any of Hitch's classics. The commercials you may have seenfor ""Vertigo"", the trailers, or the plot summaries are completely misleading. This is not a love story. It's not even about James Stewart's fear of heights. It's about the dark, twisted side of human nature and the atrocities we're capable of when we allow ourselves to be driven by fear, greed, illusions, and obsession.John ""Scottie"" Ferguson (James Stewart) is a retired detective who's haunted by guilt over an accident that had an officer killed and left Scottie with a newly developed fear of heights. One day, Scottie receives an unexpected request by an old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) to shadow Elster's wife Madeleine (Kim Novak). Elster believes that Madeleine is being possessed by the spirit of her great-grandmother, Carlotta Valdez, a woman who went insane and committed suicide. Ester fears that Madeleine will suffer the same fate. So Scottie agrees to follow the strange and stoic Madeleine, a coldly beautiful blonde who moves as if sleepwalking. When she jumps into San Francisco Bay, Scottie rescues her and soon falls in love with her, and she with him. But as their relationship grows, Scottie's love turns into obsession, and it only escalates when it seems he is unable to protect Madeleine from Carlotta's vindictive spiritIf you are unfamiliar with what happens next, I will stop there. What happens next must take you by surprise. By 1958 Stewart had proved that he had range and a dark side in his acting, but never did he exemplify it more than in ""Vertigo"". His character goes on such a downward spiral that even after all that Scottie's been through, we're not so sure we want to root for him anymore. Kim Novak makes an inspired Hitchcock Blonde. With her stiff mannerisms, translucent skin, pale blonde hair and famous gray suit, she almost gives the impression of being encased in ice in the early outdoor scenes.One of ""Vertigo""'s biggest surprises is Barbara Bel Geddes as Scottie's close friend Midge. Bel Geddes (who died in August 2005 at the age of 82) is absolutely magnificent, bringing depth and refreshing warmth to a potentially thankless part. You really feel for Midge when Scottie, blinded by his infatuation with Madeleine, cruelly brushes their friendship aside and all but abandons Midge. On bad days I can't figure out what Scottie sees in frigid basket case Madeleine as opposed to warm and witty Midge.Minor quibble aside, ""Vertigo"" is an honest-to-God masterpiece, with its hypnotic opening credits by Saul Bass, sinister, mind bending Bernard Herrman score, dizzying suspense scenes, and bizarre love story. It is not to be missed."
ohlabtechguy,"Mar 26, 2007",6/10,"Just saw the ""restored"" version of ""Vertigo"" on video. Had never seen the movie before. First half was exceedingly dull as Jimmy the sleuth followed Kim on her aimless journeys. The pace and excitement picked up steam when Kim seemingly threw herself out of the missionary bell tower. But as the mystery unfolded, the plot and especially the ending scene where Kim falls again become so far fetched as to leave the viewer feeling like they had just experienced two HUGELY wasted hours. And Jimmy falling in love with Kim shortly after meeting her is both unethical and unbelievable. Afterall, he was hired by HER husband to follow her. And then he wastes no time making out with her and becoming obsessed with her after only a few short days. Totally UNREAL, especially for Jimmy who, as a star, is traditionally a thoroughly likable guy.The restoration effort turned out a beautiful product, full of color and clarity, and the movie serves as a wonderful historic insight into 1958 San Francisco, but other than that, this movie has to be one of Alfred's worst. Entertainment value is ZERO.OK...After reading some glowing reviews from other commentors, I just had to add a few more criticisms.Firstly, the scene where Jimmy falls off the step stool into Barb's arms is so MELODRAMATIC, namely Jimmy's facial expression, that it was laughable. Alfred should have seen how UNREAL and overdone Jimmy's expression was and changed it. I didn't buy it for a second.Secondly, though I like Jimmy Stewart, I found him unlikeable in this part. I cannot get past his UNETHICAL, UNPROFESSIONAL involvement with his friend's wife whom he has been PAID to follow. It's INEXCUSEABLE! And I'm a liberal minded person.Thirdly, Jimmy looked at least 25 years older than Kim. I find older men lusting after the young and beautiful to be both unsavory and undignified.Fourthly, Jimmy, though he's certainly old enough to be wise and experienced, was playing a stupid character who makes a lot of stupid mistakes. Kim, on the other hand, is practically a lifeless prop and a mere backdrop for Jimmy's inherent stupidity.Final assessment - There are no likable characters in this movie. The real Kim comes across as pathetic in her need to feel love at any cost and Jimmy is downright unlikeable. He's just dumb. Thus, no real sympathy is created for either character.My question becomes: HOW did any respectable and professional movie reviewer such as Ebert miss all this????"
patrick_dunne,"Oct 23, 2005",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock may have been one of the most famous and influential directors that ever lived. Sure, he was limited to suspense films, but nobody-and I mean nobody could make more suspenseful films than Hitchcock. Vertigo is no exception.The great, yet strange storyline will leave you on the edge of your seat, as the detective Scottie follows around a woman who is perhaps possessed by the ghost of Carlotta Varde. Seemingly paranormal things happen, and the storyline is far from predictable. It takes twists and turns, and will leave you guessing and wanting more. You will wonder about the actions, and you will ask yourself ""What will happen next?"" When you finally guess, you will find your self surprised, shocked, but satisfied with the outcome.It's fairly realistic too. It takes place in San Francisco, and you will be astounded be all the familiar sights. Then again, there isn't one thing that isn't astounding about Vertigo.This movie makes a smart and fun thriller. Every minute is something fresh and new to satisfy your craving. It's one of my favorite movies. Nothing will make you hold your breath, or excite and bewilder you like Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Nothing.10/10"
tfrizzell,"Jul 6, 2002",N/A,"Along with ""Psycho"", Hitchcock's best film that wraps itself around the viewer very fast and never does let go. San Francisco detective Jimmy Stewart is slowly going crazy due to a failed mission which did not work because of his intense fear of heights. This is all front-page news of course and Stewart is shamed about the whole event. But a ray of light shines as he gets a job to watch a man's wife (Kim Novak) who is supposedly having an affair with another man. Stewart believes this is his chance to put the past behind him, but sometimes the future is even darker. Stewart falls in love with Novak and the love turns into a dark and twisted obsession that becomes deeper and deeper as the film progresses. When tragedy strikes, that is the end. Right? Not quite. An amazing screenplay and arguably Hitchcock's greatest directing venture make the film solid and Stewart's stunning performance raises the whole project to a classic level. Somewhat ignored around the awards circuit in 1958, but ages beautifully as the years go by. 5 stars out of 5."
PudgyPandaMan,"Jul 7, 2008",9/10,"Okay, so I love this movie just a little! But what's not to love! One Of Hitchcock's greatest movies in my opinion. There are so many good characters in this movie - but I almost think my favorite character is the city of San Francisco. Not really, it's Jimmy Stewart. BUT San Fran sure figures prominently in the movie. What a gorgeous city. Perhaps I'm a little partial because my husband & I spent our honeymoon there 20 years ago. The cinematography alone is worth seeing this movie as it is filmed beautifully. Also, there is some artistic twists like the green lights and haze in Novaks apartment.This movie is definitely a great plot twister the 1st time you see it. It of course loses some of the bang with subsequent viewings since you know the twist. However, subsequent viewings are still enjoyable as I always notice different tidbits and details I didn't catch before.I love Jimmy Stewart in his love-sick puppy, obsession role. I love the title theme music. It starts creating tension right off the bat, and keeps your pulse going throughout the movie, anticipating what is going to happen next.I just recently re-watched the movie (probably my 5-6th time) with my 14 year old daughter, who was seeing it for the first time. I had yet been able to convince her to watch any old, classic movies with me ( too old fashioned in her mind). But for whatever reason, she agreed this time. And what a great 1st classic movie for her to see. I was surprised but she not only stuck with it all the way to the end, but was actually somewhat riveted throughout the movie! What surprised me is she somewhat predicted the ending ahead of time. That kind of shocked me because I never saw it coming the first time I watched.I'm not sure why, but Midge's character creeps me out more with each viewing. Especially the painting scene - she seems like a stalker, obsessed lover. But Bel Geddes plays her beautifully.You definitely have to see this movie. It is one of Hitchcock's best!"

It's not like they were exciting car chases.It's not my favorite Hitchcock movie. I did like James Stewart when he gets obsessive. He's good in that section. As for being too old for the part, that to me seems to work for him in this movie. His obsession becomes more self-destructive. It has a creepiness to it.I have to admit that I didn't recognize Novak as Judy Barton. It confused me a bit at first. I think people of that era would have an easier time recognizing Kim Novak. As homage to its importance and inventive camera work, I'll add an extra point or else I would have given it 7/10."
Stampsfightclub,"May 31, 2009",9/10,"Retiring cop John Ferguson (Stewart) is hired to stalk Madeline Elster (Novak) and finds he is slowly falling in love with the suicidal woman.Vertigo has now become one of the most critically acclaimed crime thrillers by the legendary Brit Alfred Hitchcock.The opening title sequence is excellent; particularly considering it was made in the late 1950s when technologically was restricted. The tantalizing colour montage and shifting images makes the James Bond efforts look like child's play. The accompanying song helps generate a feeling of excitement and we are right at the start of an energetic movie.The opening sequences with Stewart's Ferguson and his job partner chasing an anonymous villain across the rooftops is vintage action and excitement, perfect Hitchcock styling also. Then as Ferguson losses his balance and is caught dangling we have the setup for a beautifully lit film.We learn Ferguson has now retired from developing vertigo with this experience and what follows is a sweet slow build up in the mystery of the beautiful and strange Madeline, an estranged woman played with a sharp vagueness by Kim Novak. Her soft dialogue and timing help set her up for an emotional interplaying manipulative character in the latter stages and is a fine character development by Hitchcock.James Stewart, in his last pairing with the director, is impressive once more with a professional but eager character. This particular role of the star is often remarked as a dent in an otherwise brilliant film.It is perhaps easy to see why as he has no mysterious vigour that his character from Rear Window had and the story perhaps required more from him here in 1958, but I thought he carried the emotional scenes well.Vertigo is labelled as a tantalizing thriller and when comparing it to modern day films with the same tag you wonder if something has gone wrong. There have certainly been rapid developments over the last 50 years and the renowned ones in the 21st century, the Bonds and Bourne's, have that vibrant fast energy with extra charisma. Vertigo is the build up to what was to come, a major influence. The car scenes for example are slowly paced but edge up a gear as the stakes in the plot steadily rise.Vertigo therefore is thankfully not dated but given the vast amounts of modern thrillers, it may seem so to others. It may lack suspense when the romance lingers but the sheer spectacle of the story puts this doubt away.Hitchcock once again has a consistent directional release with wonderful character placement and a fine selection of twists and turns to give the would-be dull parts that excitement. One excellent part is towards the end in the Bell Tower when we see Ferguson's shake up of Vertigo. It is fair no one does a bird's eye view shot like the brilliant Hitchcock, who once again, has made a classic."
elvircorhodzic,"Jan 28, 2017",10/10,"VERTIGO is an exciting and tense mystery melodrama. One capable detective from San Francisco was haunted by memories of a tragedy that occurred on a night chase for one criminal. He stars being afraid of heights after those events. Withdrawal from work is an obvious choice. He enjoys the company of a romantic painter, who is in platonic love with him. However, he accepts the detective work, trying to help an old friend, whose wife suffers from a mental disorder. He becomes an important link in the game of conspiracy and intrigue...The story is very complex, interesting, tense and anxious. A romantic adventure between cruel secrets and unfathomable mystery. Mr. Hitchcock has toyed with intrigue, identity and dreams in this film. Powerful psychological reviews permeate between dream and reality. The main protagonists are torn between deceit and obsession. Soundtrack is very important and well corresponded with slower plots. Hitch has established a lighter pace, in order to show essential details.Scenery is magical. Something between fog and sleep. Characterization is almost perfect.James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson has managed to combine tension, informality and obsession in one character. He is a victim and avenger"" at the same time. The difference between love and obsession is very small. His guilt turns into anger and disbelief. This is the first film in which Mr. Stewart does not dominate in the usual way. Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster is, due to the dual role, quite amazing. Her acting is not at a high level. However, she is stylish, eerily beautiful and enigmatic. She is torn by internal struggles between love and truth. Characters are not honest. None of them. This is very interesting.Love and passion can be a serious weapon in manipulative games and crime."
mts43,"Sep 15, 2021",7/10,"The film was a failure with both critics and audiences when it opened, and I think they were still correct -- I have never understood how it eventually became considered a ""masterpiece"". The plot is convoluted and unbelievable. Novak is not at all convincing as the ""haunted"" Madeleine. But most of all, the pace of the film is far too slow paced and tedious, as if it was necessary to fill two hours of screen time. The various innovative camera techniques are interesting, and the best thing of all about the film is the striking cinematography of 1957 San Francisco and the Bay Area."
valleyjohn,"Mar 2, 2011",4/10,"In a year when there has been some odd films , films that are not easy to explain ( Shutter Island , Black Swan , Inception etc..) , i thought i was on safe ground watching a good old fashioned Alfred Hitchcock thriller but little did i know this is just as unexplainable as any of those films i have named . Vertigo is sometimes called "" Hitchcock's masterpiece"" but i don't see it. This is a long ponderous movie that makes very little sense and treats the viewer with contempt. Jimmy Stewart is watchable but his character is not very believable and the relationship with Kim Novak is confusing and annoying. I much prefer Rear Window or Psycho to this movie and to be perfectly honest i couldn't wait for it to finish."
stryker-5,"Dec 12, 1999",N/A,"A retired cop is hired by a San Francisco shipping magnate to follow his beautiful wife, because she has been behaving oddly.  Scottie Ferguson begins to trail Madeleine, and finds himself powerfully attracted to the disturbed young woman ...""Vertigo"" was inspired by the French novel, ""D'Entre Les Morts"" by Boileau and Narcejac.  Vera Miles was meant to play Madeleine, but she became pregnant.  Plans were already well advanced when Kim Novak stepped in, and the portrait of Carlotta Valdes which intrigues Madeleine is in fact a likeness of Miles herself.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie from TV's ""Dallas"") appears as Midge, the artistic intellectual who once had Scottie but lost him.  Watch for her telling little glance when Scottie mentions their now-defunct engagement. Apparently, Hitchcock gave Bel Geddes minutely explicit directions on when to raise and lower her gaze (""I look up, I look down ..."").  Midge will never regain her place in Scottie's affections and she knows it.  Twice in the course of the film she is referred to as his mother-figure, a role which she seems fated to adopt, against her own inclinations.  The character of Midge is left to wither on the vine.  Once Scottie gets out of hospital there is simply no room for her in the narrative, and we never hear of her again.Midge's pet-name for Scottie is 'Johnny-o', and the strange truth is, Johnny-o is a sicko.  He carries a weighty burden of guilt over the policeman who fell to his death (shades of ""Spellbound""?) and he now suffers from vertigo, the camera lurching queasily whenever he looks down from any height.  This much-imitated Hitchcockian trick consists of zooming the camera in whilst simultaneously tracking back.  The custom-built church tower proved unsuitable for the lurch-shot, so the effect was achieved by filming inside a scale model (laid horizontally, incidentally).Scottie's sickness is insisted upon from beginning to end.  Like a voyeuristic stalker, he pursues Madeleine obsessively, watching her from the shadows.  When he pulls her out of the Bay, he sits her in her car and clinches her like a lover, repeating her name over and over.  He neither calls an ambulance nor informs her husband.  Instead, he drives her to his apartment, undresses her, puts her in his bed and plays with her hair. Later, the way he accosts Judy Barton is threatening and inappropriate. Director of Photography Robert Burks lights Stewart's face from below for the disturbing moment when Scottie begs Judy to dye her hair blonde. Scottie spends an inordinate amount of his on-screen time sitting alone in his car, symbolically trapped in the bubble of his unhealthy sexuality.The colour green is the emblem of Scottie's kinkiness.  Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore) whets Scottie's sexual appetite by setting up his first glimpse of Madeleine in Ernie's restaurant.  Her gown has vivid flashes of green, and Scottie becomes fixated. She drives a green car, and Scottie pursues it through San Francisco's gridiron streetplan like satyr chasing faun.  When he sees the car again after his spell in hospital, he runs to it and physically embraces it.  When he spies on Madeleine in the florist's shop, the bright green counter occupies a quarter of the Vistavision screen. Bright green lawns outside the art gallery prefigure the central 'village green' of San Juan Bautista.  These are important sites which Scottie associates with Madeleine.  When he has her at his mercy, naked in his bed, he has on a revolting green sweater.  Madeleine gives in and agrees to accompany him on a date, and he gives a sick smile as he drives her through the lush greenery south of San Francisco.  The phallic sequoia trees are of the genus 'semper virens', translated by Scottie as 'ever green'.  Judy attracts Scottie like a moth to a flame when she looks out of a window, dressed head-to-toe in green.  It is when he sees her silhouette against the green-tinged net curtains that he knows who she really is.  His excitement reaches an unhealthy pitch when she emerges from the bathroom with blonde hair, the room bathed in ugly green light.For a story so carefully prepared by Hitchcock and his writers, Coppel and Taylor, ""Vertigo"" contains some major weak points.  Elster's ruse is unbelievably far-fetched.  To get the half-drowned Madeleine to his apartment, Scottie must have used her car and abandoned his own.  Is that credible?  And how come Madeleine is able to dress and leave in the few seconds it takes Scottie to answer the phone?  The coroner accepts as fact the suicide attempt near the Golden Gate Bridge, even though this evidence can only have come from Scottie, whom the coroner publicly disparages. Would Judy really be so foolish as to wear the necklace which gives her away?  The film's ending is too much to swallow.Kim Novak is on record as saying that Hitchcock insisted on her wearing the grey suit, the exact same one that Scottie forces Judy to wear as he remoulds her identity.  Like Scottie, Hitchcock had a thing about aloof blonde ice-maidens (Hedren, Kelly, Novak) ...  Scottie quotes a Chinese proverb about remaining responsible for a life once you've saved it.  Did Hitchcock feel the same way about the Madeleine/Judy/Marnie girl to whom he had granted life?"
jluis1984,"Feb 13, 2006",9/10,"When Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" opened in 1958, it had a cold reception by both critics and audience, and many even consider it a failure in his remarkable career. Even Hitchcock wondered about what went wrong and he blamed lead star James Stewart for the failure. What probably happened, was that this time, Hitchcock's usual walk on the dark side went a bit too far for the times.""Vertigo"", based on Pierre Boileau's novel ""d'Entre Les Morts"", is a dark tale of romance, obsessions and lies, all spiced up with the lead character's acrophobia. James Stewart is our protagonist, as Scottie, he plays a detective whose sudden retire from the police was caused by an accident involving his acrophobia, his fear of heights.Hired by Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), a mysterious old friend from school; he accepts the mission of following Elster's wife, Madeline (Kin Novak), who supposedly is possessed by the ancient spirit of one of her ancestors, and that eventually will take her life. As Scottie tries to protect Madeline, he falls in love with her, starting a forbidden romance that is doomed from the start. After Scottie fails to save Madeline's life due to the vertigo caused by his acrophobia, his obsession with her take him to commit unexpected actions.Boileau's complex story of obsession may had been too much for the critics and the audience of its time; and watching James Stewart going from a regular guy to a man bordering insanity certainly didn't help the film. Nevertheless, time has proved that ""Vertigo"" was indeed a powerful film undeserving of the cold reception it had.James Stewart gives probably his best performance ever, the sudden fall from grace that eventually take its toll on Scottie is perfectly portrayed by Stewart. Hitchcock was really wrong at blaming James for the failing, as it was the audience who was not ready to see their hero turned into a grotesque monster.Kim Novak plays his role with grace, although certainly her character is not as demanding as Stewart's. The movie is all about Scottie and his failed romance leading to the destruction of his life. This complex persona makes him one of the best fictional characters ever written, let alone portrayed on film.The technical aspects of the movie are superb too, Hitchcock creates a brilliant composition of colors and the visuals are beautiful. Bernard Herrman's score is subtle but fitting, although not as powerful as his famous work on ""Psycho"".If a flaw is to be found, I would say that the script developed for the film was probably not the most friendly for the audience. This film is certainly not for everyone, as it's slow pace and heavy darkness in the subject may turn off people familiar with Hitchcock's lighter films as his usual dark humor is not present here The only film I can relate to ""Vertigo"" in terms of harsh ""darkness"" would be ""The Wrong Man""; although the big difference is, that in that film, the trouble is caused by outside forces, while in ""Vertigo"", we get a glimpse to that dark part of our soul we do not dare to watch.The first time I watched it, I was not sure about what had just happened in front of my eyes, not sure if it was good or bad. After a second watch I guess this is of the kind of films that grow on you. Some consider it a failure and others consider it a masterpiece; my opinion stands closer to the latter: I call it a great piece of cinema. 9/10."
moonspinner55,"Sep 7, 2005",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" has a narcotizing effect, a lulling, dream-like ambiance that is hard to shake off, which may explain why many viewers keep returning to it. It's also a strangely muted and anticlimactic film, posing yet another possible reason moviegoers watch it repeatedly: they hope (or need) to get more out of it the third or fourth time. Retired police detective James Stewart meets and makes over a woman who reminds him of his only true love--a suicidal woman he lost, but perhaps can find again by dipping back into the past. Hitchcock seemed to relate to Stewart's ""Scottie"" moreso than any other character in his films, and--having a gleeful touch of nastiness himself--is careful not to let him have his way. Glamour-mystery is gorgeous to take in, fascinatingly written and well-acted. Only one question: is the hotel manager (Ellen Corby) part of the scheme or just a dotty old broad? ***1/2 from ****"
bobsgrock,"May 29, 2009",10/10,"It can be argued in many different ways what actually is the best film Alfred Hitchcock ever made. For my money, it is Vertigo, the masterful story of a man who finds a woman, loses her, and attempts to bring her back with harrowing results.What makes this film so engaging, even after multiple viewings, is the way in which Hitchcock is able to bring us to sympathy with the protagonist, Scottie Ferguson, an ex-detective with some serious psychological issues. As Scottie begins to follow the wife of one of his college friends, he becomes fascinated by the icy, alluring blonde. We feel the same way. When something terrible happens to her, we feel the anguish and guilt Scottie does. Of course, none of this could be possible without the incredible performance of James Stewart, perhaps his best after the role of George Bailey. And Hitchcock makes the most of this evocative first half, told mostly in long shots and soft lighting.The second half is more of an attempt for Scottie to rebound and when he finds a girl similar to the mysterious blonde, he finds himself trying to recreate that which is gone. Of all of Hitchcock's films, this may be the strangest with themes of necrophilia, voyeurism, and sexual obsession. Matching Stewart's incredible performance every step of the way is Kim Novak, in my mind the best of Hitchcock's blonde actresses, so beautiful yet almost forbidding in a way. Maintaining every scene with careful scrutiny and eye for detail, this may be Hitchcock's best showing as a director, and it all leads up to one of the best filmed endings in cinema history and leaves you needing to watch again, hoping to catch a glimpse of the true emotions of Scottie and Judy, or is it Madeline?"
cfelico,"Jan 22, 2006",10/10,"This movie is just breathtaking with all its visuals and its aura is
just amazing. The cinematography and of course the directing and
impeccable acting is just many of the ingredients to Hitchcock's
masterpiece. It is undoubtedly his best work, and is a cinematic
masterpiece to this day, it is one of the best pictures caught on film,
so pure and enigmatic to film history, it flows like good wine. Anyone
who doesn't agree doesn't understand film at all, or is just one-sided
or biased against this film. THe only way this film should ever be
remade is if Hitchcock rises from the grave to direct it himself,
otherwise it should never be touched or ruined, and left alone as the
masterpiece it is. This is a masterpiece through all cinema's history,
so hopefully Hollywood will get the point, and not touch it. Some
movies need to be remade, but this is not one of them."
bill-kehoe,"Feb 5, 2006",10/10,"One of Hitchcock's three best movies (North by Northwest and Rear Window are my other two favorites) which I can watch over and over again.The external reviews for Vertigo will give you more insight into this movie than I can but for me, when I first saw this movie in the late '50s (I was very young), it planted the seeds that drove me to move to the bay area from the east. My obsessions were cultivated later.The setting, San Francisco at its prime, with its hills and sharp light contrasts because of the surrounding waters add to the ever changing but hypnotic backdrop of this color film. Even Bernard Herrmann's music score emphasis the mood swings of its characters to pull the viewer into its vortex.Vertigo is a dizzying production of dark and light, ups and downs. It is the story of one man's obsessions for controlling his surroundings and desires to a point where his life is spinning out of control. Or is it? It has been written that Hitchcock in real life was controlling and manipulative (""All actors should be treated like cattle"") and why all the blonde, austere, frigid women? So, plot, acting, direction, photography and music are all mingled to give the viewer a wonderful, mesmerizing, voyeuristic look into obsessive behavior. More relative today, almost 50 years later!"
FlickJunkie-2,"Jan 2, 2001",10/10,"Many believe that this was greatest work of a master renowned for the outstanding direction of suspense thrillers.  Alfred Hitchcock creates a vortex of emotion and deception in this classic film about obsession.There are so many complex themes to this story that it requires several viewings to appreciate.  It metamorphoses numerous times, shifting from a detective story, to a love story, to a murder mystery, and finally to neurotic obsession.  It is a deep character study of flawed characters. Some are not what they appear to be and others change before our eyes.Hitchcock's direction is superb, not only from the standpoint of assembling the story, but from a technical perspective as well.  The photography, lighting and perspectives are brilliantly done and locations wonderfully selected, especially the shots at the foot of the Golden Gate Bridge. Hitchcock also brings forth outstanding performances from Kim Novak and James Stewart.  Stewart generally played admirable and heroic characters in his career so the deeply flawed John Ferguson was a clear departure for him. This is probably his best and most gut wrenching performance and I don't think it would have been possible without Hitchcock's direction because Hitchcock was the master of bringing such characters to life.  Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes (most famous as Miss Ellie on TV's `Dallas') also give excellent performances.Bernard Herrmann's musical score is superlative.  It is beautiful, compelling and chilling and brought additional power to almost every scene. Hitchcock had such great respect for Herrmann that he stated during production that whether the scenes of the film worked or not depended completely on the music Herrmann would write.  He trusted that Herrmann would create just the right mood, and he was correct.The DVD version presents us with a completely restored version of the film with rich color and powerful sound.  The new DVD is the only way to watch this film if one hopes to experience it the way it was originally presented in 1958.This film is ranked number 61 on AFI's top 100 movies of the century.  I rated it a 10/10.  It was virtually ignored at the Academy Awards garnering only two nominations for set decoration and sound.  However, it endures in the opinion of many as one of the best suspense thrillers ever made."
Steffi_P,"Nov 23, 2006",10/10,"Perhaps the most significant thing about this masterpiece from Alfred Hitchcock is that it is the film which broke Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock took the ultimate nice guy, the honest, likable everyman of heart-warming Frank Capra romantic comedies and gradually turned him into an obsessive, mentally deranged control freak. A very deliberate stroke of genius in casting, but it is only one of many things that make this an incredible picture.Hitchcock's films are not known for their visual style. There was always the occasional attention grabbing close-up or freakish angle, but by and large he made his impact through pacing, plotting and expressionist arrangement. Vertigo is the exception  it really is a feast for the eyes. Most important are the colours, a fact which Hitchcock establishes right from the start with the kaleidoscopic opening credit sequence. He shows full mastery of Technicolor, comparable to the films of Michael Powell. Each location has its own colour scheme  neutral light browns for Midge's flat, traffic-light red for Ernie's restaurant, glowing green for the hotel where Judy stays. The green motif  here symbolising rebirth  crops up again and again in relation to Madeleine and Judy. Even the water she attempts to drown herself in has a greenish sheen to it.One thing that characterises Hitchcock's films is that, no matter how complicated the plot is, it is conveyed in a way that the film can be understood in a single viewing. You're never left wondering who some minor character was supposed to be or confused about some character's motivation. Vertigo is no exception, although it is one of the most complex and twisting plots of any Hitchcock picture. He dispenses with his trademark suspense (with the exception of the red-herring opening scene, Scotty is never actually placed in any danger) and plunges into the depths of his psychological streak. It is perhaps also Hitch's only genuine film noir, although it is rarely referenced as such (probably because noirs are typically in black and white). It does however have all the typical noir elements  a femme fatale who leads the hero astray, a kind but plain woman who loves him and, in between the two, an upstanding, well-meaning lead man whose life unravels because of his own faults.Vertigo is also as abstract as Hitchcock's early Fritz Lang-inspired efforts, but here done infused with the more confident later Hitchcock style. There are colour filters, dream-like cinematography (particularly good in the sequoia forest sequence), the famous zooming-in, dollying-out technique and an animated dream sequence. The dazzling imagery could be seen as prefiguring the influence of psychedelia a decade later, although really it is perhaps only the logical extension of the German Expressionist style. It's only really an updated version of the superimposing of images and casting of shadows in films by Fritz Lang and FW Murnau. For this reason Hitchcock could be called one of the truest heirs of the German Expressionist movement, and not just for the psychological angle.It's an amazing accomplishment of both lead actors that they are both essentially playing two different characters each. James Stewart starts off in his comfortable, familiar friendly type that he is used to playing, but by the end of the picture he has transformed into an cruel, obsessive monster. Kim Novak also plays two very different roles as the prim, icy Madeleine and the worldly and down-to-earth Judy. Barbara Bel Geddes gives a great supporting role as Midge.Another thing worth a mention is Bernard Hermann's score. I'm not a big fan of Hermann, but I'd say this is his best score for Hitchcock. He matches the action perfectly. There are several long sections without dialogue, and here the music plays a similar role to a silent film score. In fact the timing of every element in the film is spot on  one example being a wave crashing on the shore in the background when Scotty and Madeleine first kiss.The first time I saw Vertigo I was hooked, right from the opening moments to the final shot. While its power to hold me has diminished somewhat over repeated viewings (a weakness of all Hitchcock films, the flipside to their being instantly enjoyable) it still looks amazing and it can still send shivers down my spine. It's an incredible achievement."
P4thFiendR,"Jan 2, 2023",6/10,"The Good:The production is astounding. The beauty of the set, clothes & just the movie in general is a sight to see. This movie really shows an era of the United States that never was & will never be.Visual novelties. Hitchcock adds a little something in this movie, showing us through visual effects that the character has lost his mind through color grading for example.The Bad:Everything else. The plot is bad, the movie is very slow (showing us for an hour Jimmy Stewart follow Madeleine's car), the twist stinks & the movie just never pays off. I wouldn't recommend this movie nor watch it again."
f-odds-1,"Aug 5, 2012",1/10,"It staggers credulity to read that this dull, plodding film with its embarrassingly silly plot has now been rated as the greatest movie of all time. I have watched it three times: in the early 60s when it was first released in the UK, again some 10 years ago and once again last night. Nothing has changed. Vertigo doesn't merit high rating even among Hitchcock's prolific output; to elevate it to all-time supreme status is an unspeakable act of self pomposity from the critics concerned.A film like Vertigo depends almost entirely on raising the viewer's interest in its characters. Disappointing, then, that its two principals play their roles as if they're half-asleep on drugs. James Stewart has many times played with success the seemingly slow-witted, slow moving character who's aware of a lot more than it appears. In Vertigo this Stewart stock persona is inappropriate. One wonders if they first shot the scene where he's mute, staring and unresponding in the hospital and he decided to continue in this mode but mouthing the script lines as they came along.How anyone could begin to fall in love with such a frigid, boring personality as played by Kim Novak is beyond comprehension. She is consistently out-performed by trees, buildings and props throughout the piece. Far from conveying an intriguing, sexually arresting character, she leaves the viewer marvelling that nobody thought to save budget by substituting a tailor's mannequin.Had Vertigo been directed by anyone without Hitchcock's reputation (one that's deserved but which, most unusually, seems to encourage enthusiasts to believe he never makes a clunker) it would have been written off as poor stuff — indeed it was correctly regarded as mediocre when it first came out. It isn't a bad film, in the sense of godawful, laughably inept. It's just so far from good that people with normally functioning eyes and ears will shrug and say ""ho-hum!"""
george.schmidt,"Apr 23, 2003",N/A,"VERTIGO (1958) **** James Stewart, Kim Novak, Barbara Bel Geddes, Tom Helmore, Henry Jones. Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece of suspense and romantic obsession: Stewart (in one of his best go-against-the-grain performances) stars as San Francisco cop John 'Scottie' Ferguson, whose eponymous phobia leads him to an on-the-job lethal accident. Sitting out his time off from the force he's enlisted as a private eye to watch a friend's troubled wife Madeleine Elster (the ethereal Novak), who believes she has been reincarnated. Scottie's case leads to complications including the necropheliac emotional overhaul he succombs to after Madeleine's 'suicide' and seeing her in mystery woman Judy Barton (Novak again, proving to be an accomplished actress).More psychological underpinnings you could shake a stick at and thanks to The Master's multi-layered storyline the film never falters largely thanks to the incredibly affective cinematography by Robert Burks, the adaptation of Pieree Bouileau & Thomas Narcejaq's novel 'D'Entre les Morts' by Alec Coppel & Samuel Taylor and once again the excellent chemistry between the tormented Stewart and the bewitching Novak, proving to be one of the most passionate ill-fated couples in cinematic history. Perhaps the icing on the cake is the hauntingly evocative score by long-time collaborator Bernard Herrmann. A true American classic."
commandercool88,"Jul 7, 2008",10/10,"'Vertigo' has through the years become more highly regarded than it ever was at the time of its release. It is oftentimes referred to as the most important film Hitchcock ever made, his masterpiece. While this assertion is purely in the eye of the beholder, there is a unique quality about 'Vertigo'. It is like a fine wine, fermenting over the years to become a landmark film that will haunt and disturb you.Alfred Hitchcock's 1958 vision proves to be a deeply personal quest to the heart of a man's soul and his elusive search for true love. It's a haunting story of obsession, a painful portrait of loss. The picture dives much deeper than we've ever seen Hitchcock do before, and it doesn't always make for comfortable viewing. The nature of the story itself is troubling and difficult to tackle, and 'Vertigo' stands as a true testament as to what Hitchcock was capable of doing with a camera. A man who could tell a story like few others, and in a way that was entirely his own. He made countless great films, but 'Vertigo' strikes at a core where films rarely go.What is it about 'Vertigo' that makes it such an unsettling picture? There's a lingering eeriness throughout it all, a morbid atmosphere, as it acts simultaneously as a romantic love story and a troubling look at obsession. Everyman Jimmy Stewart delivers a memorable performance and brings to life a character who's own mental state seems in serious question. His journey is our journey, and the film taps into a part of the human psyche rarely approached by cinema, and it causes us to feel vulnerable and uneasy but unquestionably transfixed.The wonderful Kim Novak dives into 'Vertigo' in two starring roles, and the object of Stewart's encroaching affection. Filmed in classic technicolor and with a color pallet made up of sensuous greens and tantalizing reds, it only brings out Novak's striking beauty even more. The eyes are a pathway to the soul, and one glance from Novak is more than enough to capture your attention. It all seems to play into Hitchcock's master plan, whose true intentions are sometimes never quite known. Two fascinating leads, a powerful score, lush colors and textures, haunting landscapes, out-of-body dreamscapes. This is classic Hitchcock, and some of his most profound work.'Vertigo' is hypnotically beautiful, and ultimately tragic. There's a complexity here that's difficult to penetrate, and I believe it's how Hitchcock intended it. There are questions we may have, but Hitchcock forever took those answers with him many years ago. And yet there's something about this film that continues to fascinate audiences today, a beating heart that's allowed it to grow over the years but with Hitchcock's original and haunting vision still intact. 'Vertigo' may not be his definitive masterpiece, but it may just be his most accomplished work.More reviews: rottentomatoes.com/vine/journal_view.php?journalid=219276&view=public"
vip_ebriega,"Oct 11, 2009",10/10,"My Take: Still one of the most effective and engaging thrillers ever made. An obsessive work of art as only Hitchcock could make 'em.Misunderstood and unappreciated upon its release, VERTIGO is now one of the most celebrated and much talked-about film from the master Alfred Hitchcock. Not even Hitchcock himself could create such an entrancing film as VERTIGO ever again. It's an unqualified success from the man well-regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". VERTIGO isn't just a great puzzling thriller, it's art. Like a painting by a sophisticated artist, you stare ponderously at VERTIGO and you'll always find something new and intriguing to talk about it.Although criticized for being miscast in the role, James Stewart gives one of his best and darkest performances as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a former cop who had to quit the force due to his Acrophobia. In a chance of redemption, Scottie is contacted by an old college friend (Tom Helmore) to investigate on the strange behavior of his wife Madeline (Kim Novak). After this set-up, the movie takes a plunge into the deepest and darkest realm of Hitchcock pleasures. A knotty thriller and a romance with a twist, this is Hitchcock at his very best and most satisfying, but you may want to go back and see it again and again just to get the hang of things, but consider that one of the film's many pleasures. In a time where love is considered a powerful feeling, one that conquers all obstacles, Hitch also unveils the darker side of such heavenly feeling; love as a dangerous poison. One might say it's a case of Hitchcock baking his own cake and eating it, but it's more of letting out that skeleton in his closet; unveiling his innermost and deepest obsessions and raising it way up high for everyone to see. As a result, VERTIGO didn't do so well in it's day. But that just proves it: This movies way ahead of its own time. Had Hitch gone the wrong way, he might have lightened its tone and gave it a cheesy Hollywood ending. Had it been done that way, VERTIGO couldn't possibly be talked about as much today.After 30 years of absence, VERTIGO was re-released sometime in the 80's (along with other classics as THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH, THE TROUBLE WITH HARRY, ROPE and REAR WINDOW, now dubbed the ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"") with restored footage and sound. On DVD, Hitchcock's classic is better than ever, with first-rate picture quality and sound. You'll swear the movie has not been made THAT long ago. The picture is clear, making the film look like its brand new, and the new soundtrack is breathtaking (Bernard Herrmann's score never sounded so great!). This is a perfect treatment to a one-of-a-kind masterpiece that's bound to entertain and be studied for generations to come.Rating: ***** out of 5."
malkane316,"May 23, 2004",10/10,"yes, quick, as others reviewers have gone into greater depth, and i can't add anything new.Oh baby, what a film! 1958!!! This has plot twists, even effects that put movies of today to shame. One of the most complex films ever made, with something new arising with each viewing, I think this, along with The Seven Samurai, is the best movie of all time. The first time I watched it, I had no idea how it would end, and what would become of Scotty and Madeleine. My only qualm is the fact that Midge completely disappears from the movie in the second half. Why?! It's not important though. Superbly shot, and immaculately directed, as always. 10 out of 10"
JaydoDre,"Jul 22, 2015",6/10,"This film has two relatively major flaws, both story related.The first issue is that right in the beginning of the film, and then later once again, it smears on you a sudden thick layer of awkwardly placed exposition, like some cheap Japanese anime. This should not be a thing in a professional piece of work like this.The second issue is that, as with many Hitchcock's movies, the story relies on one of the characters being an idiot in order to work. The premise is that a detective affected by vertigo is asked by his old pal to solve a mystery surrounding this friend's wife's strange behaviour and, as you watch the events play out it becomes apparent fairly quickly that the main character is being played. It is obvious, and it should be particularly obvious to a detective, but the movie pretends like it is not.And so, you find yourself mentally trying to hurry the movie up. ""Yes, I get it, the main character is obsessed and is being played. Come on, get to it already, get to the reveal. It's obvious. Come on."" As the movie was drawing out the inevitable, the famous Hitchcockian tension was starting to wear out its welcome, as the dialogue and the music were getting increasingly teary-eyed.And then, at around the 1:40 mark the story takes a nosedive. Instead of revealing the truth at the end, the film spills the beans right then by means of a second blunt exposition pour, where the main twist of the film is simply shown to the audience in a flashback and then explained through the thoughts of one of the characters. Look, movie, I know I was mentally hurrying you up, but I did not mean for you to prematurely unload yourself in the most unsatisfactory manner. What a letdown!The very ending is a bit problematic as well. It feels like the writer did not know for sure what to do with the two main characters after all the cards were revealed. The way the story concludes, feels odd and rushed.It is a real shame because the performances are good. The main character played by James Stewart is charming. The tension is there. There are some special effects used, including animation, which looked cool. Even the premise is quite interesting at face value, but the execution is unfortunately also very noticeably flawed."
john_seater,"Nov 18, 2015",1/10,"I finally watched this old chestnut. I read somewhere that it was a flop when it came out but later became recognized as a classic. Apparently Alfred Hitchcock blamed James Stewart's being too old for the part. The two never worked together again. Well, Stewart wasn't the problem. The problem was the script, which is simply asinine. The public was right the first time: the movie is terrible.The hero falls in love with a woman who is supposed to be nuts and who gives him no reason at all to fall in love with her. She has a few mad scenes with him but never engages in any conversation of any substance on any topic, never does any activities with him, etc. On top of that, she is his old friend's wife. Her only attraction is that she is good looking, but lust for a pretty woman isn't love, which is what the hero is supposed to feel. Totally implausible.The movie runs 2 hours. There is a great deal of boring driving around San Francisco and the nearby California coast in the first half of the movie. I started looking at my watch at around 1:15 into the movie. Was this thing ever going to end? At about 1:30 the main plot is revealed. It is pretty silly and quite routine. The remaining 1/2 hour is torture. The plot gets more and more ridiculous, all the while getting more and more predictable. My impatience got more and more intense. When the truly idiotic end finally came, I was both relieved (over at last!) and outraged (what a waste of 2 hours)."
secondtake,"Jul 25, 2009",10/10,"Vertigo (1958)This movie isn't quite about what it seems to be about at first, and we shift from an odd detective case to a case of falling in love, to a case of just falling, and then the movie goes through one of the most convincing psychological twists in cinema. That is, the second portion of the movie is a brilliant inquiry into the mind of the retired detective played by Jimmy Stewart, and into obsession, and eventually to revelation. While the crime is solved eventually, it's really a small point. This is a love story, and a complicated one but also a passionate one. The ending will leave you gasping.There are celebrated aspects to note: the psychedelic insert in the middle as a dream, the zoom/pull effects of vertigo, even the classic femme fatale/plain girl contrast (the latter a brilliant Barbara Bel Geddes). And there are some less known touches, like the green neon lighting used on the interior of the room at the Empire Hotel, or the generally clear vivid brilliant Technicolor palette. There are bit parts and famous sets (the Golden Gate Bridge and the San Bautista Mission, which didn't actually have a bell tower like this one (that was added through cinema trickery).There is also an amazing use of subjective effects--the light falling improbably, or a haze covering the scene for no reason except the main character's mind. Much of this stuff pushes Hitchcock into true art film territory, and yet he keeps it a mainstream commercial flick that is accessible and popular.Most of all there is subtle deception between characters and between the movie and the viewer. Hitchcock has never preferred the sudden surprise, leaving the viewer in ruins (or just in shock). Instead, he tells you what's going on--in this case, we learn of the murderous truth halfway through the film, so that we aren't wasting energy solving the crime but are instead trying to get into the characters' heads. It is the psychology, and the conflict of desire and doubt, that drive the movie. It's not slow, by the way, it's lyrical.Some people might object to the falseness of many of the key scenes, but that's the nature of films that are not purely naturalistic. And the nature of nearly all of Hitchcock movies after 1940. Absorb the style as brush strokes--they don't get in the way of verisimilitude once you agree the truth is not the point. Drama and beauty and originality are. All of those are here full force."
johcafra,"Jun 27, 2009",10/10,"For reasons pretty much spelled out in my review of The Bridge on the River Kwai, this is another film that I appreciate more with age.I can be succinct about this. James Stewart's performance is his best. His character's obsession, whether or not you think it the result of unconscious seduction, is made all the more gripping because we are so much more accustomed to his portraying characters who are direct, purposive, honest and forthright. In a sense Scottie is...until he isn't.Kim Novak is, simply put, beautiful to the point of unearthliness. But this triangle has four sides, and Barbara Bel Geddes is also very much the player. She too is beautiful...or at least given her profession you get the idea she full well knows how to judge beauty...yet she cannot possibly compete with Scottie's fixation, which makes her recognizing that all the more painful and the instant focus of our sympathy.Where does age come in? How readily each of us can place ourselves in each character's shoes. The smug would doubtless think, ""You can't always get what you want,"" but how long did it actually take each of us to learn that? Not only the players but Hitchcock himself had to have known and understood that, and in his peerless directorial fashion he enhanced the portrait, adapting even the surroundings to suit. To me the plot is at times but a contrivance...until the very end.A postscript concerning Bernard Herrmann's musical score: Get a good recording and play the opening theme at theater volume without any visuals or even an attempt to recall the Saul Bass title sequence. In fact, darken the room you're in or listen at night. The music throbs and pulsates. Brilliant."
jerniganrx7,"Jul 5, 2004",10/10,"I just recently rented this movie from a video store and did not think of it to be all that- I figured just another IL' movie but boy was I wrong! I can honestly say this is a spectacular movie on a totally different level compared to movies of today. The story is not a very complex, Its your typical drama/murder-mystery, but the way Big Al had the actors do their scenes was just perfect and this in turn makes the movie very strong and captivating to watch. The cast could not be any greater; Jimmy Stewart' who doesn't know this guy-But the real shocker is the blonde in the gray suit-actress Kim Novak, who I did not know was awesome in this movie.I am a 29 year old guy that has seen his fair share of movies but none that stain my mind the way this one did. The use of strange behavior and deceit left me with a cold feeling inside. But the master of horror has no problem pulling this off. I heard that this movie was one of Alfred Hitchcock's favorites and I have to say one of mine as well."
orsino44,"Dec 11, 2007",10/10,"When I first saw Vertigo, I was too young to appreciate it. Years later, I gave it another look and was totally blown away. I love Hitchcock, he hardly ever fumbled in his entire career, and this is among his very, very best (along with Shadow of a Doubt).Never mind what some have said about Stewart looking too old -- his age is one of the main things that makes this movie work. If Scotty hasn't been around the track a few times, where is the tragedy of his complete and total fall into obsession with a young, beautiful and unattainable woman? In addition to which, JS does some of his greatest acting here. The final climb into the tower is a tour de force, an absolute masterpiece of film acting that has to be seen multiple times to be fully comprehended.Another thing about Vertigo that makes it remarkable for me among Hitch's films: he didn't have some of his usual collaborators here. Vera Miles was pregnant, so her role went to Kim Novak. Barbara Bel Geddes is another unusual (and terrific) choice. Not seeing so many faces I associate with other great Hitchcock films somehow gives Vertigo a special life of its own. Beautifully written, shot, cut and acted and what a phenomenal ending. When there was nothing more to say, Hitch, to his credit, said nothing. (The supplemental ending is garbage.) Take a look at Vertigo; it's amazing."
GOWBTW,"Jul 8, 2005",9/10,"This is not bad for a 50's movie. Especially if it's from Alfred Hitchcock. The beginning of the movie didn't look like anything from that era. I mean, the title and the background effects, it looked more scientific to any era. The affects of a phobia always impairs a person's work. And conquering them shouldn't be a problem. But if the person has ""Vertigo"", like the main character, conquering the fearing always have drawbacks. Scottie Fergerson(James Stewart) has vertigo and the fear of heights, that effected his work and cost a police officer's life. The guilt haunts him. Midge Woods(Barbara Bel Geddes, before DALLAS), is a designer and painter who seems to be the stronger characters in the movie. I thought is was funny when she painted the picture of the sitter with her likeness in it. For Scottie, he was not amused. SHAME ON YOU, SCOTTIE! However, the obsession made him too obsessed on finding out the mystery woman he's tailing. The woman(Kim Novak) was somehow just a pawn instead of the culprit when Scottie's friend hired him to look out. Guilt followed him again when she jumped off the roof, or so it seemed. The real pawn in the movie was Scottie himself. His own friend took advantage of his condition, and try to make him feel guilty again. Conquering the fear of heights is not easy, only if you let it persist. Like the old saying, The only thing you have to fear its fear itself. Rating 4 out of 5 stars."
James L.,"Aug 11, 2000",N/A,"The basic plot: An ex-police officer with fear of heights is assigned by a friend of his to keep an eye on his seemingly off-the-edge of sanity wife , but he soon becomes enamored with Madeliene and when she commits suicide ,he finds another girl with a passing resemblance to her who he has clothed, dressed , and done ultra-specifically like Madeliene, but then he learns her secret......The praise: Incredibly dreamy and cool, actually an allegory of the human love of the difficult and mysterious, the strange and the icy(Madeliene), over the plain and familiar( Midge, his ex-fiancee ), and the natural urge to explore and obsess with the strange,scary and beautiful  in the human sex urges.            Oh,yeah and James Stewart and Kim Novak are truly great in their respective roles. Jimmy Stewart is near-perfect as the mild-mannered soul with kernels of obsession both sexual and for a single mysterious woman , with a phobic fear of heights, known as Scotty. Kim Novak is perhaps perfect, drawing on wells of truly deep emotion and currents of beauty untold. Oh yeah, there is a great swooning Bernard Herrman score. It is the most stylish movie , elegantly photographed and designed with a truly elegant beauty that is both modern,old, and religious.There also is great suspense along the way , thrills,chills and mood. Perfect Hitchcock. Must-see.The flaws: The ending  is too uncharacteristic and pat of the rest of the film."
emasterslake,"May 29, 2006",7/10,Vertigo is about Jimmy Stewart portraying a detective named Scottie who quit the academy due to his fear of heights after a recent police chase.He tries by over coming his fear of heights by himself but was unable to accomplish his fear.Recently old college friend hires Scottie to watch his wife Madeleine who has reportedly become possessed by her ancestor's spirit named Carlotta.Madeleine believes she's a reincarnated version of Carlotta and has had visions of places she's never been to before.Scottie kept an eye on Madeleine and eventually started to care for her a lot. He's determined to solve Madeleine's mystery and connection with Carlotta.This Hitchcock film is good. Has some surprising moments like in his other films. Jimmy Stewart is excellent as usual. Strongly recommended to all the Hitchcock and Stewart fans.
Prismark10,"Mar 22, 2014",7/10,"Vertigo is a film whose plot elements have been borrowed many times and has been a huge influence on Brian De Palma.James Stewart is a San Francisco detective Scottie Ferguson who develops a fear of heights during a rooftop chase in the opening scenes of the film.An old college friend Gavin Elster hires him to follow his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak) because she might be possessed by some ancestral spirit. Scottie becomes enchanted, even obsessed by Madeleine who he saves from suicide and falls in love. However later throws herself from a church and he is unable to save her because of his fear of heights, Scottie falls into a deep depression.After he has got better he finds a girl (Judy Barton) who reminds him of Madeleine and he also becomes obsessed with wanting her to look and dress like Madeleine which leads the film to another diversion.The restored version of this film looks gorgeous although it also highlights the backdrop in Stewart's apartment. Novak in dual roles simply shines and the film is intriguing. Barbara Bel Geddes who has a thing for Scottie disappears half way through the film as her role becomes redundant and James Stewart does well as he again looks to become unhinged once he becomes transfixed with Judy Barton.However the film's denouement two thirds way of the film feels unsatisfactory and I can see why Hitchcock was not happy about it. The mystery would had been better resolved at the end of the film."
dlpburke,"Nov 5, 2015",1/10,"This film is exceedingly annoying to watch - unless you happen to be one of the multitude of pretentious fools who think their intellect is better than everyone else's because they ""get it"". Well, I have news for those dumb-asses: There is nothing to get.Vertigo is plodding, annoying, and the pacing is terrible. The characters do not act like real people; it's yet another film where this is the case. What makes it all the more infuriating is that there IS a clever story buried under all the sewage, clawing to get out. And it never does. Even at the end, there's a brief moment where things actually make sense - where there is some semblance of reality - only for it to be dashed by one of the most ludicrous finales I HAVE EVER SEEN. It's THAT BAD. That ending would be laughed out of the cinema today (and probably was back then), but because this film is considered a 'classic', it's applauded as some kind of masterpiece. It isn't. It's just an exceedingly daft finale to a grossly unrealistic film.The only way I could possibly enjoy Vertigo is if I had very little logical thinking. Unfortunately for all the die-hard movie buffs masturbating in unison, I am not a conformist who feels a need to nod their head in agreement, just because society says I am in the presence of brilliance. I was not in the presence of brilliance, just stupidity. The emperor has no clothes.My rating: 1/5."
dkncd,"Nov 1, 2007",9/10,"Perhaps the best word to describe Alfred Hitchcock's ""Vertigo"" is ""bizarre"". The film even gives this impression with the twisting imagery and hypnotic music of its title sequence. Next, John Ferguson is introduced as a detective that retires due to his inexorable fear of heights. An old friend of John's contacts him and asks him to investigate his wife's strange behavior, which he explains is a result of supernatural forces. John is skeptical and reluctant, but quickly takes the case and begins to observe a bizarre chain of events.James Stewart plays the role John Ferguson and is effective at portraying the transition from impartial investigator to an increasingly involved and even unnerving one. Kim Novak is also excellent as the enigmatic and sporadic Madeleine Elster. Barbara Bel Geddes is also memorable as Midge, particularly in the ""painting"" scene.Most of the story doesn't rely on direct plot twists, but rather a methodical investigation of the mystery presented near the film's beginning and the interesting and peculiar behavior of the subject under investigation. The film is well-made such that it doesn't tip its hand early as to the solution to the mystery, but when the film's major twist does come it is brilliant. This methodical approach is effective, although personally I preferred other Hitchcock films that featured more twists over this one. The film's bizarre quality is developed with the help of eerie music and unorthodox effects sequences, including an interesting effect to represent John's fear of heights."
cfelico,"Jan 22, 2006",10/10,"This movie is just breathtaking with all its visuals and its aura is just amazing. The cinematography and of course the directing and impeccable acting is just many of the ingredients to Hitchcock's masterpiece. It is undoubtedly his best work, and is a cinematic masterpiece to this day, it is one of the best pictures caught on film, so pure and enigmatic to film history, it flows like good wine. Anyone who doesn't agree doesn't understand film at all, or is just one-sided or biased against this film. THe only way this film should ever be remade is if Hitchcock rises from the grave to direct it himself, otherwise it should never be touched or ruined, and left alone as the masterpiece it is. This is a masterpiece through all cinema's history, so hopefully Hollywood will get the point, and not touch it. Some movies need to be remade, but this is not one of them."
helpless_dancer,"Sep 21, 2000",9/10,"Excellent drama about a cop who is hired to watch over a wealthy man's wife. This he does while slowly losing his heart to her. As usual, Hitchcock give the viewer a double dose of tension and bizarre excitement. I particularly enjoyed the psychedelic bits the film utilized in the opening credits and when Stewart was having his nightmares. Very good plot, with some real surprises along the way, especially the stunning finale. Great movie. Plus, Kim Novak is a definite babe!"
john-basileo,"Feb 21, 2008",10/10,"I'm not sure I can adequately express what I feel about this film. It's hypnotic, almost surreal. Does anyone else think that? Maybe it's the way it was shot, or the score, or the actors but the net effect on me is that I'm watching a movie but I'm also watching something more than just a movie. It's almost like you're viewing a work of art, something not unlike a great painting or piece of sculpture. And no matter how many times you view it, it still has a profound effect on you.This feeling is something you either get or don't get. I know all sorts of people who say it's boring or it's tedious or it's not believable. These are the ones who don't ""get it."" But it's like someone else's comment here about the film....see it 20 times and you'll come to realize how magnificent it is. To compare Vertigo to North by Northwest is preposterous. I love NBNW but Vertigo is Hitchcock's crowning achievement. Many claim it's the greatest movie ever made and I'm not prepared to argue with them.Another thought....the scene where Judy emerges from the bathroom, now totally transformed by Scotty back into Madeleine, and bathed in the soft green neon light of the hotel sign, and with Herrmann's leitmotif, played heretofore in various unfulfilled versions, now fully realized and climaxed....well, this is unquestionably the most beautifully spine-tingling moment in the history of film."

neil-126,"Apr 22, 2000",N/A,"I'm a latecomer to Hitchcock's films, only discovering them some 10 years ago.  But it didn't take long for me to discover which ones were the most brilliant of his work.""Vertigo"" is one of those films that needs repeated viewings to understand every detail.  Even I was fooled the first time I watched it!  I give a lot of credit to James Stewart's fine acting in this film.  At first, it appears he's about to launch into yet another of his familiar ""friendly man"" roles. But as the film evolves, you start seeing him unravel.  First, he's convinced to shadow an old friend's wife, despite his own objections. Next, we realize he's not just shadowing, he's turned into something of a voyeur (and starting to fall for the girl he's been tailing).  When he witnesses her death, he completely unravels and we see yet another side, the disturbing side where he's seemingly lost all touch with reality.  (The nightmare sequence is, to me, one of the most tense in the movie.)  He slowly recovers during the balance of the film, only to be shocked once again at the conclusion.  (And Hitchcock wisely left the after-effects of the conclusion up to the minds of his audience.)Kim Novak is also stunning as the woman being tailed, and as the ""down home"" girl Stewart recognizes on the street, a total role reversal.  Barbara Bel Geddes also does a nice job as the mothering, love-lorn lingerie designer who just can't seem to do just enough to get Stewart to fall head over heels for her.At times, the film seems a little slowly paced.  This may be for the effect of having the audience percolate and simmer while the characters develop. We're kept in suspense as Stewart trails Novak around San Francisco.  And we're jolted out of our trance after he rescues her out of the bay.  We're later seduced as Novak dries off in his apartment.  And shocked as one disaster marks the pivotal point in the film.  Hitch was good at suspense, and there are many different kinds of suspense in this film.  Definitely one of his best!"
OldieMovieFan,"Apr 30, 2023",6/10,"This film suffers from the same malady as much of Hitchcock's work, namely trite stories poorly told, surrounded by fine camera work and sets and well-acted scenes.There aren't really holes in the plot, instead the plot itself is a hole. Hitchcock tries to show a kind of psychological prowess but it's.... well, trite. And it isn't even looking back at a different era that makes it so - these were stale ideas at the time of filming. By this time, 1958, Brando had substantially exhausted the psyche-examining genre and Lupino had already trod those paths before him. Edward G Robinson in the 1930s was showing his character's psyches without the sort of preachy methods that Hitchcock resorts to again and again. It's a much more natural effect and has a greater impact.There's an idea floating around that Hitchcock invented the dolly zoom with this film but of course that's nonsense. Lots of older films used it. Bill Seiter was doing it in the 1930s. Griffith was doing it in the 1910s. Ford tried it and failed with The Ringo Kid's entrance, thus the blurry shot; he didn't bother spending the money, or couldn't afford, to run the shot again but you can clearly see the dolly rolling during the zoom. Same thing with 'We're in the Money' from 'Gold Diggers of 1933' the dolly rolls back a full city block while the zoom lets the audience stay on point. Orson Welles knew how to use it effectively in his first film; for example the dramatic entrance by the Nurse in the intro of 'Citizen Kane.' It could be said perhaps that Hitchcock made the trick popular with later directors and film critics, but he certainly didn't invent it.There is a magical quality that Technicolor had which apparently can't be reproduced by other methods. 'Adventures of Robin Hood' and 'Gone With the Wind' are the best of the early examples. One of the very last films to use Technicolor, 1965's 'El Dorado,' has the same ""feel of the film"" as those early films and this movie too, and it's the Technicolor process that creates it. It evokes a certain era of the movies that is now long gone. 'Vertigo' certainly doesn't belong in the same category as those masterpieces, and in spite of the myth around him, Hitchcock doesn't really match up to their directors either. Hawks, Curtiz, Victor Fleming - John Ford and Merv LeRoy too, for that matter - all have an ability to reveal emotions that is quite beyond Hitchcock, who instead resorts to camera trickery in his attempt to achieve what those masters achieve with their casts and crews. But it's still a fine example of film-making by a great director and a decent cast led by one of the greatest actors in history."
MovieAddict2016,"Jul 20, 2004",10/10,"I'm not sure I'd say this is Hitchcock's finest film (personally there are so many masterpieces he made - Psycho, Rear Window, Shadow of a Doubt, Strangers on a Train, The 39 Steps, The Lady Vanishes, The Man Who Knew Too Much, etc. that it's hard to choose) but it is definitely ONE of his finest films.A twisting thriller that opens with a bang and follows the physical and psychological journey of an ex-cop (James Stewart) who has a fear of heights and an obsession with a mysterious woman (Kim Novak) that leads to a chilling finale.As a filmmaker I find this extremely inspiring and along with the work of Scorsese, Kubrick, Cameron, et al, this is one of the films that EVERY filmmaker points to at one time or another. Hitchcock practically reinvented cinema techniques with this. Some of them (such as the lens effects) are outdated and could be altered more drastically nowadays but that is irrelevant - it still holds up despite its dated quality and that's what matters. The film is rooted in story and the style comes afterwards.A brilliant motion picture that captures the essence of cinema and why I love to go to the movies.5/5"
dmitryfridman,"Jul 5, 2024",7/10,"My problem with this movie is that it's from the different generation and it didn't age well. Watching it on normalspeed is really tough. The plot is predictable - HOWEVER i have to admit the bias - this movie was an inspiration for so many that saying it is a cliche is kinda wrong - this movie CREATED all it's followers that are cliche and using same trops. In the same time, givingthis movie a benefit one has to admit that Kurosawa movies did age well and are entertaining to watch even now.Any score should be incorporating both THAT time and CURRENT time evaluation.SO - if you're interested in the history of the cinema - do yourself a favor and watch it."

However, I think it was necessary because there was no coming back from what she's done.I (21 as of March 2022) finally found a film made before the '90s that has the potential to be one of my favorites (movies with a 5/5 or 10/10 rating).I should introduce this film to my friends soon."

Vertigo is definitely the type of thriller movie that we will never see again mainly because movies today don't require you to have a strong attention span...where as movies from back in the day require you to have a strong attention span. Really great film from Alfred Hitchcock, it's still insane to me that this amazing director never won an Oscar...doesn't make any sense. Great film, awesome film and it's a definite 10 from me...alfred Hitchcock is the godfather of thriller...no one will ever surpass him even in today's time."
Lejink,"Mar 24, 2014",10/10,"Hitchcock's masterpiece? Well, that's debatable, when there are at least six other major contenders I could think of. And yes, I've read the criticisms, about James Stewart being too old in the lead, the twist revealed half an hour before the ending, Judy's lack of surprise when Scottie turns up at her door and more, but in a great movie, you suspend these inconsistencies and instead let yourself get wrapped up in the whole experience.Right from the start, from Saul Bass's literally eye-popping title sequence and Bernard Hermann's hypnotic theme music, a spell is created although being Hitchcock, this is occasionally punctured with surprise elements. Immediately we're catapulted into a thrilling roof-top chase, culminating in the tragic consequences of Stewart's Scottie Ferguson character's vertigo. He seems to suffer a nervous breakdown and despite the devoted attention of the adoring Barbara Bel Geddes, he falls into a carefully contrived murder plot managed by an old friend, keen to inherit his wife's fortune. To do this, Scottie is manipulated into tailing and then building up a relationship with Kim Novak's Madeleine, yet another of the director's icy cool blondes, his vertigo ruthlessly exploited as the murder is perpetrated. However a chance meeting on the street with Madeleine's doppelgänger leads them both back to the scene of the crime with tragic consequences for both.I don't think there's another of Hitchcock's films where he displays his genius so well. The legendary fluidity of his camera we see time and again, it being particularly suited to the rise and fall of the streets of San Francisco as Scottie pursues his prey. Of course it's a sexy film and naturally being Hitchcock, there's a dark undercurrent to this, what with the ""romantic hero"" indulging in something approaching necrophilia in recreating his dream (but dead) woman, plus just how does Madeleine end up naked in his bed, after he's saved her from drowning? The pacing is exemplary, at key points time is compressed for dramatic effect, at other times the camera languidly relaxes allowing the viewer to witness the wonderful cinematography of Frisco's landmarks in the bright Californian sunshine.The dramatic finish, where we're literally left hanging with Stewart and wondering what his next move will be atop the clock tower as his dream is destroyed a second time is a masterpiece of brevity and suspense.Essays have been written about this film almost since it was first released, itself a sign of the complexity and the depth at work here. I'm not one for re-watching films too much, preferring to see something I never have before, but ""Vertigo"" keeps dragging me back in wonder and admiration of one of the masters of cinema at his considerable best."
Soumyadeep9190,"Oct 16, 2025",9/10,"Man, I just finished watching Vertigo and I am blown away. Hitchcock didn't just make a thriller here... he made something that creeps inside your head and stays there. It's about obsession, love, guilt, and the kind of haunting feeling you can't shake off.James Stewart is insane in this. You feel every bit of his confusion, his heartbreak, his obsession... it's like watching someone slowly lose themselves and you can't look away. Kim Novak is unreal... her presence on screen is hypnotic, almost ghostly.Everything about this film is deliberate. The camera work, the colors, the spirals... it makes you feel vertigo in the truest sense. Bernard Herrmann's score isn't just music, it becomes part of the story, part of your nerves.The story drags you into this dark obsession slowly, and by the end, that final scene hits like a punch to your chest. You leave the theater feeling empty, haunted, but also in awe. This is more than a movie... it's an experience.Hitchcock at his absolute peak. Maybe his greatest film, and honestly, one of the greatest films ever made."
DKosty123,"Dec 24, 2006",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock made a lot of excellent films. This James Stewart - Kim Novack film is a gem. The cast is extremely well suited for the film. Vera Miles was the original choice of Alfred to play Novaks role but production delays because of Hitch's Gall Bladder surgery & then Miles could not do the film because she was pregnant.The script is based upon a French novel, the original working title of the film is ""From the Dead"".Stewart is a policeman who gets a fear of heights on the job, & then his fears are played by a evil one who cons him into believing someone he loves is dead. He nearly goes off a commits suicide when he finds out he has been used for a dishonest purpose when he finds the girl he fell in love with, only to lose her again.Barbara Bel Geddes (Miss Ellie on Dallas) is dandy in support as Stewarts lady in waiting. Novak, Stewart, & Bel Geddes are intense in their roles. Ellen Corby (Grandma Walton) & Raymond Bailey (Milburn Drysdale on the Beverly Hillbillies) also do support roles.This film has great special effects The restored version looks great with over $1 million dollars invested in it by Universals restoration team. San Francisco & the Bay Bridge look very well in the shots there. Hitchcock actually chose the locations for this film while he was shooting Strangers on Train in 1951. San Francisco never looks better on film then in this one.Bernard Herman does a great score. The original Paramont Stereo tracks were found for the restoration.The effects in the film are dazzling & recreated meticulously.If you a fan of suspense or Hitcock, this is a great film for your viewing as near perfection as it gets."

Got to admit that I was pretty apprehensive, as doubts began to cloud my expectancies.Fortunately, it fared considerably better than I anticipated!I liked the story, loved the storytelling, felt for the characters, and was also privy to the romance portrayed on screen. This was a far better experience overall.The major complaint that I had with my previous viewing (Rear Window) was that I could not feel the stakes, nor did I get a feel of the supposed suspense; however, here I did.I liked the way the tale meets its end, a bit tragic, yes, but a befitting conclusion nonetheless!"
cafescott,"Dec 8, 2014",10/10,"""Vertigo"" (1958, Alfred Hitchcock﻿), deserves its reputation as the greatest American film ever made. Despite its ridiculously far-fetched story, it mesmerizes even after dozens of screenings. As great as Hitchcock's form is here, Bernard Hermann﻿'s beautiful, symphonic score is also essential to the experience. It would be nice if some of the growing numbers of young head-down-and-texters would venture over to the revival theater showing this cinematic landmark in order to understand how much farther great culture can lift a soul than a QWERTY keyboard can.""Vertigo"" opens with an enigma: How does San Francisco Detective John ""Scotty"" Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) survive hanging from a rain gutter from a great height? No hint is provided. The murder plot is similarly perplexing. For example, how could a murderer risk easy exposure if the intended witness manages to overcome acrophobia and climb the stairs of a steep tower? We toss away plausibility when experiencing Hitchcock's universe, but the payoff here is huge.The famous reveal in 'Vertigo' is the subject of much scholarly discussion. (The film's twist is revealed about 25 minutes before it might have used as a surprise.) According to legend, every leading figure involved in the production disagreed with Hitchcock on the reveal, including Mrs. Hitchcock. Hitchcock had to fend them off. In his subsequent interview with François Truffaut﻿, he explains his preference for suspense, not surprise.There are several very widely-read biographies of Alfred Hitchcock with co-workers all saying he was impossible to like on a personal level. In ""Vertigo"", the two leads have a strong argument. Despite how effortlessly the very gifted Jimmy Stewart﻿ plays Scotty, Hitchcock is said to have blamed Stewart's premature aging for ""Vertigo's"" box office failure. Hitchcock never worked with Stewart again, breaking up a legendary collaboration (of four superlative films). In addition, Hitchcock was unhappy with Kim Novak﻿, and is said to have publicly criticized her after 'Vertigo' was released. (Novak maintained a dignified silence.) I don't know what Hitchcock said about Novak, but it seems that Hitchcock has some thin department-store models showing off female clothing to Scotty and Madeleine. Also, when one of the sales women tells Scotty that Judy can wear a particular woman's suit after ""alterations,"" perhaps the comment and the slender models are both knocks on Novak's weight.Still, Hitchcock's characters show tremendous depth. Scotty's former love interest Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes) is uniquely endearing. The scene where Midge tearfully destroys her witty painting (a spoof on Scotty's obsession) is really heart-wrenching. So is Midge's final appearance, the somber walk down the hallway in the sanitarium. Hitchcock really connects with lonely hearts through Midge. It is ironic that an artist as universally disliked by the people who worked with him could produce such profound moments with common people as we see him portray Scotty's forgotten ex-girlfriend. People tend to forget this when teeing off on Alfred Hitchcock, the man.If you have watched 'Vertigo' a few time notice how Hitchcock manipulates point of view. For example, when we first see Scotty after the opening predicament, he is in Midge's apartment. Seated but physically diminished, Scotty is balancing a cane when he says, ""ouch."" The background is particularly busy. There is visual chaos all around Stewart's outline. It looks as if the background objects just fell from a height, not Scotty. Scotty is being under-appreciated.It is also interesting when another point of view (besides Scotty's) is being represented. For example, we see the floating petals from Madeleine's flower just before she jumps into San Francisco Bay. Another example is when Madeleine revisits the murder with her flashback. It lasts a few seconds but her side of the story is clearly identified. (That is, it appears filmed in a manner that conveys her as a reluctant pawn in a larger conspiracy.) Hitchcock is never just pointing a camera at a set where some action is taking place. He plans every visual detail before filming begins.Cinephiles already know what a great film 'Vertigo' is. It is a perennial pleasure that never gets stale. However, please don't take any ill-advised leaps across rooftops getting to the revival theater showing it."
roddekker,"May 23, 2015",4/10,"Vertigo has got to be one of the most absurd and disturbing movies about men and their ""modern-day"" mental illnesses that I have ever seen. It's true.The mental illness that I'm talking about here is, of course - Men's totally twisted and fanatical obsession about having complete and absolute control over women.You know, I'd say that when it comes to one of Hitchcock's most psychotic ""movie-psychos"" of all-time - Scottie Ferguson here in Vertigo makes Norman Bates from Psycho look, by comparison, as if he were ""normal"", yes, NORMAL. I mean, Scottie was one really whacked-out maniac, that's for sure!Personally, I think that director Alfred Hitchcock went way too far out on a shaky limb with this one. And, being way out there, he ended up losing his balance and, literally, getting ""vertigo"", himself. This film is nothing but a bird's eye view of a supremely grotesque freak show with Scottie (representing the average American psycho, I mean, the average American male) as the main monster of attraction.At a running time of 130 minutes, Vertigo really only begins to pick up steam in the last 30 minutes. The first 100 minutes of it is just endlessly drawn out 'build-up', extremely drab, most of it."
andros12,"Oct 15, 2005",9/10,"A woman's face greets the viewer upon the film's opening sequence. The camera moves up from her lips and settles upon her eyes as a whirlpool of concentric colours begin to appear, becoming more and more beautiful and guiding the viewer like a hypnotist's timepiece into the depths of the subconscious mind.""Do you believe that someone out the past, someone dead, can enter and take possession of a living being?"" This question becomes the pivotal inquiry of the entire film as the rational, level headed detective Scotty is slowly but fatefully drawn into a swirling vortex of fragmented images contrasting the past and the present, love and reason, fate and free will, and life and death.After an old college friend named Gavin Elster asks him to investigate the activities of his wife Madeleine because of her strange obsession with her deceased great-grandmother Carlotta Valdez, Scotty reluctantly agrees to help. He is unaware that the woman that he is made to believe is Madeleine Elster is in reality an impostor named Judy Barton who is Elster's mistress and co-conspirator in the planning of the murder of the real Madeleine.Scotty's investigation into the activities of Madeleine's impostor lead him to a flower shop and then to the graveyard tomb of Carlotta. Back in the car he is led to an art gallery where he sees ""Madeleine"" seated in front of a portrait of Carlotta. He notices that she carries a bouquet similar to the one Carlotta holds in the portrait and that she wears her hair in a similar French twist. The woman subsequently drives to the San Francisco Bay area where she leaps into the water. Scotty manages to perform a heroic rescue. He takes the girl back to his apartment to dry her clothes. The stage has now been set from a series of disjointed visual images provided by a well manipulated setup of ""coincidental"" meetings to an episode involving actual verbal communication and Scotty is well on his way into a vortex of illusion. The young woman begins to convince Scotty that her motives to commit suicide are driven by the actions of her Great Grandmother who died by her own hand many years earlier at the similar age of twenty-six.Hitchcock makes great use of imagery, colour and costuming in presenting his film. For example, the vertigo effect appears repeatedly, from the initial swirling credit patterns, to the near-death rooftop scene, to the disintegrating floral effects during the wonderfully orchestrated Scotty's nightmare scene, to the tunnel-like vision of the hallway during Midge's visit to Scotty's doctor and, of course, to the final mission tower sequence.The colour green is strongly used throughout the film. Madeleine's impostor drives a green Jaguar and various tones of green reoccur continually as the movie progresses. Her character is initially resplendent in a green gown and later upon her initial introduction as Judy she is wearing a forest green dress. The prevalent use of the green symbolism creates images strongly representative of the continuation of life theme that is reinstated during ""Madeleine's"" visit with Scotty in the forest and their discussion over the cut down coniferous ""evergreen"" tree.Madeleine's impostor also makes effective ""ghostly"" appearances wearing a gray suit and also a white coat with a black scarf, both costumes wonderfully contrasted against her platinum blonde hair. Like a vapour she sometimes makes momentary disappearances, on one occasion from a hotel and on another while walking in the forest. There are some interesting shadow shots of her as well, one as she stands in the doorway upon a late night visit to Scotty, another in profile as Judy Barton in her apartment and perhaps the most effective shot is from behind as she sits on an old fashioned carriage at the mission.After Scotty fails to prevent ""Madeleine's"" suicide, she appears by ""chance"" on the street wearing a green dress as Judy Barton. Scotty eventually attempts to ""remake"" Judy (clothes, hair, make-up) into his vision of Madeleine and for a while he appears successful. One night, during preparations for dinner at Ernie's, a nightspot where he first gazed upon her as ""Madeleine,"" he discovers that Judy is, in actual fact, wearing Carlotta's portrait necklace. Scotty then drives Judy to the mission tower where ""Madeleine"" died. In an attempt to overcome his fears and to be ""free of the past,"" he forces Judy to the top of the tower. During the resulting physical and emotional altercation he sometimes calls her Judy and then Madeleine. The identities have become a blur; the vortex effect has once again enthralled him. Judy confesses to assisting in the murder of the real Madeleine and pleads for protection. The shadow of a nun climbing the stairs appears to frighten Judy off the ledge and she falls to her death from same tower from which the real Madeleine was thrown.The film's impact is primarily upon the subconscious mind, probing questions about the nature and reasons for interactions with select individuals, their impact and the role they play in the blueprint of our lives. The film opens the door to speculation about the connection between the past, present and future and the role that single and collective perspectives have in determining our experience and destiny. Finally, the film asks the age old question; is the survival of consciousness a reality and are life and death simply doors of admission to interconnected ongoing realms of possibility?"
alice liddell,"Apr 12, 2000",10/10,"No superlatives.  Detectives.  Sherlock Holmes - personally detached from crime.  Reads clues in the material world.  Navigates London, time and place can be read and contained.  Scottie Ferguson.  Obviously not detached.  He can't read material world because it doesn't exist, for two reasons: one, the world he sees has been created by someone else, a god/author figure, Gavin Elster, who like a good director gives Scottie a synopsis and a general idea of the plot, and then lets the actor (remember Hitch called them 'cattle') think he's improvising.Two, because even if the world wasn't an illusion, Scottie's vision is.  He cannot interpret what's in front of him, because he can't see it.  No more than any of us can.  Even before he begins the Madeleine/Carlotta chase, he first sees her at Ernie's, but not for what she is, a woman in a restaurant, but bathed in a strange, 'unrealistically' motivated glow.In Joyce's Ulysses, Stephen Daedelus distinguishes between Plato's  realm of 'formless' ideality, with Aristotle's more material philosophy, 'what you d--- well have to see'.  VERTIGO points up the shortsightedness of this viewpoint - Scottie sees what he sees, but it is a world of formless ideality.  But Scottie's love isn't an illusion - not only is it real and painful, but it is psychosomatic: his mental anguish is suppressed and comes out in his body, and he becomes catatonic."
XweAponX,"Apr 5, 2008",10/10,"This is maybe the one time Hitch mixed almost-Fantasy elements with one of the most intense primal fears of mankind: The fear of falling, and built a highly suspenseful mystery around it.Along with the classic camera moves which depict James Stewart's ""vertigo"" (Ie, the elongation of one long shot, a camera move which is copied and used and ab-used by director after director: Example, in ""Lord of The Rings: Return Of The King"" Frodo looks into Shelob's Lair: The closer elements in the shot stay stationary, but the farther elements seem to move away from the camera. This is straight from Vertigo).This camera trick was possibly originated by Hitch and was used in Vertigo each time James Stewart looks into a Void area: Alfred Hitchcock's depiction of this is the best pictorial representation of fear of heights, mixed with fear of vast open spaces (However this phobia is classified)- This is hard to describe unless the experience is common, Hitchcock must have had the same fear, because his depiction of it matches my experience with it- And so, as Stewart looks down, from the top of the apartment building, and later in the film when he looks straight down the Bell Tower, that visual effect where the far away parts of the image stretch away from the camera view, this gives people who do not have acrophobia and the other related fears a visual representation of what a person with those fears goes through.And James Stewart's reactions to heights during the film are not too fantastic, especially the standing on the top step of a step-stool, it is not too ridiculous that he had a vertigo attack at that point. It is important for the viewer to understand how debilitating Vertigo and Acrophobia are when mixed together, and Hitch gives us a visual taste of these fears within minutes of the opening shots of the film when Stewart looks down and the world stretches.Hitch adds to the mix, a story which is almost time-travel or psychic... Kim Novak's character pulls the wool over not only Stewart's eyes, but ours as well. She is at her most convincing when she is looking at the tree rings and saying ""I was born around here, and I died here..."" We do not know anything but Stewart's fear of heights and his apparent guilt feelings at not being able to prevent an apparent tragedy from occurring... Just in case we do not really understand this Hitch added one of the most fantastic ""Dream Sequences"" of all his movies, which is rife with clues of all sorts as to what is really going on.And this dream sequence causes Vertigo to be visually stunning. Although Hitch uses all kinds of tricks during the film to add an unreality and eeriness to the story, Stewart's Dream centers his, and our, fears into the story, and also elements are added that hint to Stewart, and to us, that there is more going on here.When Stewart finds Judy Barton, as he becomes more and more obsessed with dressing her up as Madeline, the film becomes more and more removed from ""reality"" - especially when Stewart has an Epiphany, nothing in the shot has any substance but Madeline/Judy- The background becomes washed out, it is as if the only things that exist in our universe are James and Madeline/Judy.And as the film reaches denouement, this quality reverses until everything looks quite normal.There are too many aspects of this picture to evaluate: The musical score by Bernard Herrmann is one of his best and one of the most spiritual in any Hitchcock film.Also the best use of a city as location, San Francisco in the late 50's, and some of the landmarks shown are still there. A lot of the scenery included many places that I remember that endeared San Francisco to me."
Red_Identity,"Sep 6, 2010",N/A,"Vertigo is the 6th film I have seen from Hitchcock, and it is among his best. Where Psycho's first half completely turned the tables in the second half, Vertigo goes to have a resolution midway through the film. Since I had no idea of what the plot would be, it made it a bigger treat to see the film unravel the way it did. At first, I was skeptical whether the film could reach the amount of fame it has, but once the film was over I got it. It is a fabulous written film with amazing set locations, great performances at it's core, and unpredictable story lines. At the end of it all it remains probably one of Hitchcock's most simple films, but It has an aura and tone that is distinctive to the rest of his films that I have seen. I look forward to rewatching this film and as of now it ranks up in the top half of his filmography, but I don't think it has quite achieved the same level as Psycho (so far)."
estebangonzalez10,"Aug 14, 2014",9/10,"""Only one is a wanderer; two together are always going somewhere.""Hitchcock's Vertigo is considered by many critics as the best film ever, although this wasn't always the case considering that when it was released in 1958 it was poorly received by audiences and critics alike. So much so that it marked the last time that Hitchcock worked with James Stewart who he blamed for not attracting audiences any more due to his age. Unfortunately it was the last collaboration between the two, but they left us a rich legacy. Hitchcock also blamed Kim Novak's performance, but if he were alive today he would realize what a mistake those two claims were. First of all, I believe Kim Novak was enchanting in this film, she was the perfect femme fatale in this sort of film noir suspense thriller. She was attractive and hard to decipher. James Stweart was also great and once again is believable as this obsessed man who is following this mysterious women all over San Francisco. His fear of heights, which is a key part of this film, is also believable and thanks to Hitchcok's technique (now known as the Vertigo shot) those scenes worked extremely well. However, the best thing about Vertigo is the strange twists it takes and how it surprises us with the direction it takes half way through the film. It is hard to classify this film and it goes places you never imagine. This is what Hitchcock does best in his films and that is why he is considered as the Master of Suspense. The psychological elements are always present and everything is so masterfully crafted in this film that it is hard to break out of the enchanted atmosphere created here.The film's theme of obsession is probably why it is called a masterpiece considering no other film has explored this subject as well as Vertigo does. I personally prefer Rear Window, another collaboration between Stewart and Hitchcock, as his masterpiece although that film is more generic and easier to classify. In Rear Window Hitchcock explores voyeurism, in Vertigo a man's obsession over a mysterious woman who he feels attracted to. Actually there are two women who Stewart's character relates to in this film. Other than Madeleine (Kim Novak) who is the woman he is assigned to follow around the city he also shares a close friendship with Midge (played by Barbara Bel Geddes) his former love interest from his college days. Midge is an intelligent women and the perfect one for Scottie (James Stewart), but as he becomes more and more obsessed with Madeleine she begins to be sidelined. The only issue I had with this film involved some of the dialogue scenes between Scottie and Midge during the beginning of the film which served to set up the story and their background. It never felt authentic but it accomplished its purpose. Once Kim Novak enters in the picture and the theme of obsession kicks in the film really picks up and seduces the audience into its mysterious and eerie atmosphere. It's unpredictable, but I wouldn't say this thriller is as scary as Psycho, another Hitchcock film I would rank above Vertigo. I really loved this film despite some pacing issues during the beginning and midway through the story, but other than that I agree with the claims that this is a masterpiece and a must see for film lovers everywhere. Just like Citizen Kane this is a film that was ahead of its time and one who the contemporary audience wasn't ready to embrace."
Vampenguin,"Jun 12, 2006",6/10,"You know what I think? I think everyone who has seen this film only remembers the ending. After a certain turning point near the end of the film, it lives up to it's reputation in every way. Up until then, it's a poorly paced, criminally overrated film.They call Hitchcock the ""Master of Suspense"". Sure he has earned the title, and films like Psycho, Frenzy or Rear Window are proof. Well, I don't know what happened but he was sure missing that gift in '58. Most of the film falls flat, and the first hour and a half or so, with a couple rare exceptions, drags on at a snails pace.The actors were good for the most part. Stewart gives a great performance from beginning to end, while Novak does her best work after the turning point. She seemed to be asleep for most of the first hour and a half. The supporting cast isn't awful, but not nearly as good as I would have expected.Now, there must be some reason why people hail this as Hitchcock's masterpiece? Of course there is: The ending. I wont ruin it for any of you who haven't forced yourselves to sit through this, but the ending is incredible. A couple good twists followed by a huge shocker, this is what people remember about the film.This is all-in-all a pretty lackluster film. The dream sequence and the ending are great, as are the lead actors, but everything else seems to fall flat. One of the most overrated films I've ever seen.6/10"
Primtime,"Feb 6, 1999",8/10,"Vertigo is a special kind of film. This is because it doesn't follow the usual way a film is presented to the viewer. Rather than having the main suspense near the end of the film, Vertigo has this high level of suspense at both the end and middle of the film. Few could have pulled this off quite as well as Hitch.I really liked this film in the stylish way it was presented. Time is not overly spent getting into the characters here, they are simply presented for who they are leaving the judgement up to the viewer. The ""Vertigo"" special effect and the nightmare sequence were done like nothing I have ever seen for a film of this time and are enchanting and timeless. The plot and storyline of this film are both original and not cliched. The audience is taken by surprise during the middle of the film and from there on the film becomes even more suspenseful.Jimmy Stewart put another of his great performances into this film and played well opposite Kim Novak's dark and confused character. Stewart shows the full range of emotions as he is taken by the alluring Madeline (Novak) and is driven to a deep depression. Novak had been criticized for playing her role too darkly which is a claim I find completely unfounded. For a woman who is going through so much stress (or at least we are to believe that), she plays as well as this role could have been done. The interesting thing about the performances in this film is how much time Stewart and Novak are on the screen. For 95% of the film, there is not another character to add anything else to the plot. Other than Barbara Bel Geddes, who gives a short, supporting performance, the film revolves around the realtionship between Ferguson (Stewart) and Madeline.I must say that I enjoyed this film just as much as Rear Window and would even put this one above North by Northwest. Hitchcock does suspense so well and is quite obvious to see why he is imitated so much. A recommendation to all.8/10 stars."
Xstal,"Feb 8, 2022",8/10,"Madeline behaves like she's possessed, keeps her true self under wraps and quite suppressed, but now Scottie's on her tail, a detective on the trail, but he's dizzy, giddy, spinning and distressed...... and you will be too as the tangents entwine then cascade and unwind."
Don-102,"May 31, 1999",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO has always been able to connect over the years, whether on TV or the restored video version.  To really appreciate this incredible flick from the Master of Suspense, you MUST see it on the big screen in 70mm.  Check the papers for revival houses in your area where old films from Hollywood's ""Golden Age"" can truly be revered.  The opening title sequence, one of the best in cinema history created by the immortal Saul Bass (NORTH BY NORTHWEST, CAPE FEAR), seemed entirely new to me in the darkened theatre.  Hitch made his most artistic picture with wondrous color schemes and amazing screen composition.  Just look at the ghostly greens and reds that help this complex tale absorb you and engage you.  Kim Novak's character is absolutely ""from amongst the dead"" in the mind of Jimmy Stewart (in his second best role) and the lengths that he and Hitchcock go to are exhausting and mystifying.Most film buffs know that VERTIGO is considered Hitch's most personal film, mostly because of how he molds his actresses to look perfect much like the Stewart character does with Novak. The two actors have fantastic chemistry that changes drastically from initial obsession, to love, then back to obsession.  Not much happens in terms of pure action, but as pure cinema, this movie is a landmark.  I can't remember a film that can be so visually captivating without a word of dialogue for long stretches of time.  The viewer becomes just as obsessed with ""Madeleine"", played sensually by Novak. It really is hard to figure out if there are some supernatural undertones at work, especially in the world of Hitchcock.Bernard Herrman's legendary score sounds crisp and emotional in its new, restored form and is as much a character in the film as the colors and the flowers and the hair twists that come to mean so much as the film progresses.  The ""special sequence"", or nightmare that Stewart has is VERTIGO's crowning achievement.  The animation and coloring must have awed audiences of 1958, who actually did not accept the movie at the time. Time has done wonders to VERTIGO and the people at Universal who painstakingly put the film back together for theatrical release have done an amazing job. I only hope the rumors regarding a restoration of REAR WINDOW are true. Look for it in late 1999 !?RATING: 10 of 10 NOTE: Stewart's best performance was in the great MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON"
ed_two_o_nine,"Jul 14, 2008",10/10,"This is a stunning film that really is the product of a master craftsman. Some people complain it is slow but really it is not it is just we are now used to being fed movie of a faster pace full of fast cuts. But what we have here is a fantastic study of Hitchcock's of obsession and misogyny. Where all the characters are given room to breath. It is not good to give away too much of the plot or that can relatively spoil the movie on a first viewing. The film is basically the study of one man John 'Scottie' Ferguson's obsession with one woman. The surrounding plot is really secondary to that (Hitchock's famous McGuffin). James Stewart is on magnificent form here (there really is no modern actor who could play his everyman role so well). The way each and every shot is shaped and crafted here is truly great, and we also get something which you rarely see in films these days, scenes with no little to no dialogue where the image tells the story, and here this is used superbly. From the fantastic Saul Bass opening credits through to the final shot everything here is right. The only week point being Kim Novak who I do not think is that great an actor, but apart from that the only other part of any other size is Barbara Del Geddes who is very good as Madge. We have some almost psychedelic effects shots from Hitchock to add to the deepening sense of paranoia that culminates in a great suspenseful finale. Superb to be enjoyed time and time again."
dead47548,"Jan 9, 2008",10/10,"Let me start by saying that the twist is one of the most original, shocking and simply intelligent that I've ever seen on film. I was completely stunned when it was revealed, and I can only think of one or two other occasions of me being shocked remotely by a twist. Hitchcock has a rare ability to have the film run 15 full minutes with no dialogue, yet it remains just as/if not more engaging as any action filled bloodfest we see today. My eyes became completely glued to the screen as I became just as obsessed with discovering the truth behind the mystery as Scottie was. As Lynch does in Blue Velvet, Hitchcock uses the theme of voyeurism throughout yet instead of making it perverse and disgusting he somehow makes the act feel completely natural and almost comfortable; it's just like a second nature.The use of contra-zoom to display the sense of vertigo is absolutely astonishing. It perfectly depicts the sensation and even gives the viewer a sense of the illness whenever the technique is used. The performances are fantastic. Stewart is definitely at the top of his game, bringing us right into the character in what I consider the finest work of his career. Novak is even more incredible, delivering one of my all time favorite portrayals. She is completely immersed into her character and furthers the viewer's immersion into Scottie. We really feel the same emotions as he does throughout the entire picture. The ending is unbelievably abrupt, but that makes it all the more shocking and utterly cathartic."
Manuel79,"Apr 21, 2003",10/10,"Every time I think in Vertigo (I watched it eight times) I think also in Psycho, both masterpieces from Alfred Hitchcock. And, as Psycho is an excellent movie (as ""The Shining"" from Kubrick), Vertigo is unique, is more personal and almost unforgettable: has no comparison in Movies' world. It is more than a psychological thriller, a drama or a ""colorful film noir"". Superb dialogues, a beautiful shot of San Francisco, which seems to be intentionally strange -and not the well-known american city- and, of course, Vertigo give us the best James Stewart and Kim Novak performances. There is no much to say about the score: the opening credits are not as easy to listen as ""Psycho"" or ""North by Northwest"", and the fascinating ""scene d'Amore"" (where Stewart finally changes Novak into another Novak) is just a variation of ""Tristan und Isolde"" prelude (R. Wagner). 10/10."
Kirpianuscus,"Oct 24, 2015",N/A,"a film who remains in memory for fascinating manner to explore her character by Kim Novak. for James Steward as part of dangerous game. for few scenes who are magic in profound, special sense. it is a hypnotic film. and that fact does it special. because it use different ingredients from Hitchcock's artistic kitchen for transform the tension in fascination. the love, the secrets, the duty, the fall, the fear, the obsession. and the need of true in large circles of ambiguity. a film about a couple who has in common only the fears. an end who is not the best but who could represent useful key to entire adventure. and something strange, like a shadow, who represents the best argument for discover Kim Novak as the best option for her role."
KvMauB,"Nov 22, 2004",10/10,"My father took me to see Vertigo and I instantly LOVED this classic. It influenced me to settle in San Francisco, as it is indisputably the ultimate San Francisco movie, with Bullitt a very respectable second. I have personally visited almost every real location depicted in the movie, and I love to give my out of town visitors the Vertigo tour of the places that still exist. Vertigo is a great tour of some of the many beautiful spots in and around SF.I love Alfred Hitchcock films and though Rear Window is my favorite, I think Vertigo is his best and perhaps most personal. From the opening titles and wonderful Bernard Hermann music soundtrack to the haunting conclusion, Vertigo is a visually lush and grandly entertaining example of masterful storytelling. I cannot articulate enough how great this film is and do it justice in 1000 words. The viewer is drawn in voyeuristically with the Jimmy Stewart character as he feels the tension of escalating obsession and the just-out-of-reach frustration with an unobtainable illusion. The use of music is one of the best ever in film as it reflects the inward emotion perfectly. You can hear what Jimmy Stewart is feeling. First there is curiosity, then rising tension, rising hope, and then release and resolution. Vertigo has one of my favorite film shots in it too (possibly the first time it was ever used), the zoom-in-while-backward- tracking shot, later seen in films like Jaws. Oh! And Vertigo has one of the greatest on-screen kisses of all time too, so very passionate (and I think shot on a turntable). The way Alfred Hitchcock was able to imply such sexuality in Vertigo without showing even nudity, I think, made the situations even more sexually charged, as what one imagines is far better.This is a film that earns a rare but well deserved 10/10 in my book."
g-bodyl,"Aug 17, 2015",9/10,"Vertigo is the first Alfred Hitchcock film I have experienced and that is one of the many reasons why the film will stick to my heart forever. I was surprised how this film received mixed reviews when originally released, but I guess the contemporary audience was not ready for him just yet. This film fits the definition of a mystery, but it is much deeper than that. It's a love story, and a painful one to boot. The love expressed here is desirable, but also painful, yearning, and something that can be hard to watch. That is what makes this movie a classic and one of Hitchcock's best movies in a long line of memorable, successful movies. I really enjoyed the film and the dark attributes it possesses.Hitchcock's film is about a retired detective named Scottie who suffers from acrophobia, or the fear of heights. He is tasked by a former colleague to follow his wife, who has been acting strange lately. Scottie reluctantly agrees to take the case. Once he does, he realizes something strange is happening. Not only that, he begins to take a painful obsession over this girl, Madeleine.We get some fine, professional displays of acting here. James Stewart does a great job as Scottie. He, along with the new camera-work displayed by Hitchcock, really showed how paranoid he is with heights. And that really gave me the creeps just watching him be hesitant to even climb stairs. Kim Novak does a great job in two roles of hers, especially as Madeleine Elster. She brings a sensitivity to her character which I found to be reassuring when it comes to female characters during this era.Overall, Vertigo is a very suspenseful thriller that is often scary to watch. If you have seen this film and suffer from agoraphobia, perhaps this is the film to blame. But nonetheless, films like these is why Hitchcock have been called the master of suspense. Even conversations have an aura of what is going to happen next? The ending is unexpected and really good. If you like masterful suspense films, then Vertigo is the film for you.My Grade: A-"
HenryHextonEsq,"Oct 25, 1999",10/10,"Visually magnificent film, with Hitchcock at his absoloute best. Herrmann contributes a mesmerising score, Stewart is outstanding as the ambiguous Scotty and Bel Geddes and Novak are fine. Everything gels perfectly here, with a very complex, fascinating script more than matched by the outstanding visual opulence. The colour, angles, zooms etc. used by Hitchcock perfectly capture the paranoia of the story.Vertigo gradually becomes more and more intoxicating as it progresses, and is an absolute work of art- certainly one of my top 10 greatest films ever list.Be sure to check this one out, it's a true cinematic classic. ***** (out of *****)"
ramirocardozo,"Oct 11, 2004",N/A,"Perfect is not a word used very often in the analysis of a motion picture, but in the case of 'Vertigo' the adjective seems appropriate. This film is amazing and its place in movie history as one of the best ever made is more than well deserved.This tale about tragic love, obsession, and murder is so well made that the sensation of watching it is almost hypnotic.Hitchcock's direction is flawless. He never fails in holding the viewer attention unfolding the story with unparallel intelligence and impressive skills. He masterfully creates a suspenseful atmosphere with an unsettling dark tone that leaves the viewer exhausted and highly satisfied.Kim Novak is impressive as the leading lady. She's sexy, mysterious, and vulnerable at the same time, giving the best remembered performance of her career.James Stewart as a retired police detective suffering from acrophobia is magnificent. Is hard to describe in words how good he is in this movie. At the beginning of the film he is a kind and practical person aware of his phobia and willing to cure it step by step, but as the story develops he turns into an obsessed man full of pain and guilt who desperately tries to reconstruct his shattered life. The actor makes the psychological transition of his character in such unforced and natural manner that is impossible not to believe him. This is an unforgettable performance.Alfred Hitchcock was the real deal, an outstanding director with unique vision that made extraordinary movies. It is hard to believe that 'The Academy of Motion Pictures Arts and Sciences' never gave him an Oscar for his directorial efforts. But awards are a minor thing when you look at his body of work and 'Vertigo' ranks as one his finest films, a real jewel."
darioilg,"Dec 26, 2016",10/10,"""Vertigo"" is considered by some the greatest movie ever made, and while I find impossible to give that definition to any movie, I see why it's praised so much. To date I have watched three Hitchcock movies: ""Rebecca"", ""The Birds"" and ""Psycho"". None of the three fulfilled my expectations: I see the modernity and sometimes brilliant solutions by the author, but they always felt overpraised to me. Maybe after ""Vertigo"" I'll have to watch them again and understand the depth I sensed in this one. Is it a mystery movie? Yes, but only on the surface. Like any masterpiece, this film has a number of levels of interpretation: the plain mystery, solved at 3/4 of the movie; Scottie's spiral into madness, man's need for control over life and death, the meaning of colour to address emotions. These are just a few examples of just how multifaceted ""Vertigo"" can be, evolving from the original script into a real work of art. This might very well be the best example to show how Hitchcock managed to craft popular movies with a (heavy!) authorial touch for those who can grasp it.I also loved James Stuart's performance from likableness, through catatonic depression into obsessive maniacal behaviour, and keeping a continuity in his character only the greatest actors can achieve. Kim Novak, just like every other Hitchcock girl, is not my favourite on screen, but can always get the right intensity and sex appeal necessary."
make_my_day1312,"Jan 1, 2017",7/10,"So this is what some critics think is the best film of all time? Yes it was good but is it that great? That's the problem when a film is over-hyped. It's hard to live up to the reputation. Although it is dazzling to look at, especially the famous effect shot that everyone talks about, it seemed to drag in the middle. That said, I did really like it even if it felt too long. I think if it was made today, they'd shorten the script by about 30 minutes. Maybe I just have a short attention span. Despite my concerns, I still give the film a solid 7 out of 10 but have certainly enjoyed other Alfred Hitchcock films a lot more."

cmertan,"Mar 4, 2004",10/10,"Vertigo is by far Hitchcock's masterpiece (some will argue Psycho is, but Vertigo is real technical genius).  Telling the story of an obsessed ex-cop (Stewart), Hitchcock weaves a tangled web of suspense, inner conflict, and the supernatural. Of all Hitchcock's films, this one is said to be the most personal, as it regards Hitch's fascination with women and the traits of actresses. Bernard Herrman's score is one of his bests.  Incorporating a dizzying series of notes in the string section- musically achieving the effect of vertigo.  Later, Herrman brings out his lush, romantic melodies, with beautiful tones, but always with an underlying harmony of doom. Perhaps featuring one of the best scenes in all of film history-Hitch lets his brilliance of camera work, knowledge of Herrman's musical abilities, and the actor's/actress's skill, capture us in a moment in time never to be forgotten. A perfect 10!  It never goes wrong"
liz-451,"Jul 5, 2006",10/10,"Hitchcock's masterpiece. This film was made before I was born but it's appeal is timeless enough to make it one of my top ten favorite movies.Kim Novak openly challenges Grace Kelly in the glamor stakes. Her facial expressions are riveting and clearly meet Hitch's requirement to make cinema audiences squirm uncomfortably in their seats. She is everything 50's woman was and should be. Jimmy Stewart shows why he was justifiably the icon of an age. For me, Hitch was always able to get more from Jimmy Stewart than other directors. Looking at Rear Window and The Man Who Knew Too Much, Jimmy Stewart turns in a much better performance than in the countless westerns I've seen.Hitchcock has always messed with my head. Hitch led the way and other directors followed. There is a particular camera sequence in Vertigo when Madeleine (Kim Novak) runs up a spiral staircase and Scotty (Jimmy Stewart) follows. Special effects were somewhat limited in the 50's compared to today so Hitch used the spiral staircase and camera focus to convey the dizziness Scotty was feeling. Simple but effective. So effective in fact I've seen Spielberg use exactly this camera effect in one of his movies. Almost 50 years on and this work is still fresh.The script is well written and the atmosphere between Novak and Stewart can be cut with a knife. Everything tells the story - the script, the set, the costume and the physical interaction of the leads. There is an intense repressed passion about this movie. The cast sit on an emotional volcano that seems to be constantly on the verge of erupting.The classic Hitch-twist is a real surprise. Everything in your head tells you this could never be and Hitch takes you straight in that direction. There is a strange sense of voyeurism about the second part of this movie. It feels like you are seeing something that you really should not see. You are going into that small forbidden place that everyone keeps to themselves. That part that even husband and wife don't share. As a viewer that certainly makes me squirm uncomfortably in my seat, so I think Mr Hitchcock has achieved his objective.As a movie there are pieces that date and make it very obviously a 50's movie. However, the most important part, the plot the script and the relationship between the two protagonists - dress them in fashions for the 21st century and you could re-shoot this film today.What makes this movie so very special is the emotional roller-coaster ride Mr Hitchcock takes you on. The out-of-control speed and the wheels coming off at every turn and as you look to your left you see Hitch has turned into a squealing demon delighting in every second of your discomfort. You'll feel like you've run a marathon. This movie is ""exhausting""."
susansweb,"Aug 27, 2002",10/10,"In the fifties, Jimmy Stewart made some movies that portrayed him in a not very flattering light.  The man that we saw normally playing the bumbling, shy yet great guy was now selfish, vindictive and had lost all faith in humanity.  These were great movies and his Scottie in ""Vertigo"" is one of the better examples of this.  Alfred Hitchcock weaves a tale that after watching makes the viewer feel uncomfortable with their feelings.  For we identify with Scottie and understand what he does and why we might have done it as well.  This is why I think another viewing would be beneficial because knowing all the secrets allows the viewer to watch the movie from a more objective point of view and see how twisted someone can become."
davidbyrne77,"Jan 16, 2004",N/A,"Let's get one thing straight right off the top:  This is one of the best films ever made (as if you haven't heard that enough reading these reviews). With that said, I'll say this.  I studied this film extensively in University, and I analyzed it in terms of gender/sexual power relations. There are, of course, some kinky elements to James Stewarts's obsession in this film.  What most people don't realize, is just how much that obsession is made explicit in the film, without the audience realizing. The more Scottie falls in love with (and becomes obsessed with) Madeleine, the more the real world falls away.  Literally, people start to dissapear. In the beginning, when Scottie is hired to follow her, she is seem with people (in traffic, in a flower shop).  As she becomes more and more the focus of Scottie's infatuation, the crowds of people thin out and dissapear altogether.  The museum of Art more closely resembles a tomb, as only Madeleine's and Scotties car are parked out front.  No one walks the halls of the gallery excepts Scottie, and a curator that Scottie summons for information (who only becpmes present because Scottie wants him to be there for that moment).  At San Fransisco Bay, in the shadow of the Golden Gate Bridge, it is just Scottie and Madeleine.  The colonial town up the coast where Madeleine takes her plunge is more of a ghost town, as there are no tourists, not a person in sight.  Just the two of them. In the redwood forest.  The two of them alone. It is too much of a stretch to assume that everyone in San Fransisco decided not to leave their homes that day.The brilliance of Alfred Hitchcock's directing is that he makes the camera see what Scottie sees.  He's tuning out and ignoring the other people around him, so he just sees Madeleine.  Thus, the camera only sees Madeleine, and no one else.  Thus, the city and the coast is left just to the two of them. Like Adam and Eve, only a tale of tragedy.  This 'fixation' of both the camera and the character is what gives the film its mysterious and dreamlike quality.  In a way, it's because Scottie is bewildered by Madeleine's mysterious manner, her dream-like qualities (her dream-girl qualities) that makes this film more than just a ghost story, more than a mystery or a thriller.  It's much more personal than a normal movie, and it is because the camera has become a character.  And that, my friends, is hard to pull off.  Which is why I hold Alfred Hitchcock so highly, and which is why you should give this film a second look, if you already haven't seen it once."
Vartiainen,"Nov 14, 2018",7/10,"Vertigo was not a massive hit upon its release, but it has since become a cornerstone movie, one of the most beloved movies of its director, Alfred Hitchcock, and is nowadays regarded as one of the best movies of all time, especially by critics.And it certainly is a masterful film, even by Hitchcock's standards. It's also a very complex movie, even for him. Like in Psycho, the midway point of the film turns the whole arrangement on its head, and from thereon out it's almost like a completely new film. It's not anything I've ever seen before and quite frankly it left me feeling conflicted. On one hand the sudden reveal is such an unconventional way to tell a story that I appreciate it for its novelty and uniqueness. On the other hand I cannot help but think whether the twist would have had more impact if it had been revealed in a more traditional way.This dilemma also plagued Hitchcock himself, who reportedly wanted to change the twist into a more traditional form, but the producers told him to keep it. And in the end I'm glad they did, because it is such a novelty.Aside from that the film has its usual assortment of Hitchcock goodies. Master-level technique, powerhouse actors, intense atmosphere, great music, engaging storytelling. The whole nine yards and the kitchen sink to boot.Hitchcock's best film? Personally I'd say Psycho is just a bit better, but this is surely in the upper echelons. Well worth a watch."
gbill-74877,"Jul 28, 2017",9/10,"What a wonderful, creepy, beautiful, disturbing film this is. From the opening credits, Hitchcock makes us uneasy with spiraling patterns on the screen, which hints at the vertigo/acrophobia to follow, but what we find are so many other disturbances and twists of the mind: obsession, guilt, insanity, and manipulation. There is creepy sexual desire, and what self-abasing lengths a woman will go to do what 'does it' for a man. Jimmy Stewart turns in a great performance, but as a nitpick, he's twice the age of Kim Novak (50 and 25), and also looks too old to have gone to college with his sidekick Barbara Bel Geddes (who's great by the way). The film takes place in absolutely gorgeous scenery in San Francisco, Muir Woods and Mission San Juan Bautista, and it's at once both dream-like and nightmarish. It feels like a quiet movie with its pace and small cast, but there is tension and mystery throughout. There are several stunning moments, which I won't spoil, and the ending is absolutely brilliant. Hitchcock's delving into dark places of the mind, his storytelling, and his camera angles, are all superlative. Excellent film."
oOoBarracuda,"Nov 2, 2016",8/10,"In 2012, Sight and Sound dethroned Citizen Kane as the best film of all time, ending a 50-year reign as the top film. The film in which they named the best film, was Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo. Made in 1958 starring James Stewart and Kim Novak; I was really looking forward to seeing what so many thought was a superior film to the god-like Citizen Kane masterpiece. Vertigo explores obsession and how deeply obsession can take root and the disastrous effects that can have on everyone involved. When a retired San Fransisco detective is asked to do a favor for a friend, and obsession takes root, lives are changed forever.John 'Scottie' Ferguson (James Stewart), a retired detective living in San Fransisco, has been forced to leave his job as a debilitating case of acrophobia, or, vertigo has taken control of him after being involved in a roof-top chase resulting in the death of a subject. Adjusting to a more low-key life, Scottie is spending a lot of time connecting with friends, such re-connections have led him to an old college friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore). Gavin shares with Scottie that his wife has been exhibiting some odd behaviors, in which she has episodes in which she seems to believe that she is the reincarnation of a deceased ancestor. Gavin explains that she experiences these episodes, then abruptly comes out of them, never remembering what she experienced while she was enduring the episode. Gavin asks Scottie to follow his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) as he is concerned for her sanity. Scottie obliges, and as he begins to follow her, he gets to know her and almost instantly falls in love with her. Scottie doesn't just fall in love with Madeleine, though, he becomes deeply obsessed with her. After saving her life several times from her attempted suicides, Scottie is unable to save her when she climbs to the top of a bell tower she intends to jump from, due to his vertigo. After several months of brooding after his obsession, Scottie feels magnetically drawn to a woman who looks just like Madeleine and takes her shopping and to die her hair so she may look identical to his obsession. Scottie was making a woman in Madeleine's image until he realizes he has been duped by an intricate puzzle he has unknowingly been a part of.I'm a sucker for openings and movie introductions. Vertigo opens in a brilliant way with an equally as brilliant introduction to Kim Novak as the stunning beauty that kidnaps the eye in the restaurant scene. The colors in this film are fantastic and all of Hitchcock's trials with color come to wonderful fruition with Vertigo. A psychological thriller to end all thrillers, Vertigo is a wonderfully intricate puzzle which is a superb treat for the audience to piece together. Technically, Vertigo is a film to study by anyone interesting in filmmaking or understanding films on a deeper plane and artistic level. The shot composition is divine in Vertigo, creating a work of art in each scene. I am quite partial to Jimmy Stewart and thought he did a wonderful job in the complex role of Scottie. One thing that has always struck me about Vertigo was how unfairly blamed Stewart was for the failure of the film. Vertigo was not commercially or critically successful upon its release, and he shouldered much of this blame on Jimmy Stewart. Hitchcock and Stewart had worked together three times previously, and their fourth film, Vertigo would be their last because Hitch thought someone like another stock actor of his, Cary Grant, would have brought more sex appeal to the role and producing a better final product. Unfortunately, Hitch seems to miss all that Stewart brings to the role, the deliberate motions, and movements that Grant would have faltered with. In any regard, Vertigo has etched a place in history and for just cause as a true illustration of Hitchcock's mastery."
matt_clarke1981,"Mar 28, 2005",9/10,"Having seen Psycho I thought I had seen Hitchcock's best film. This film compares favourably. Vertigo has a great cast, Jimmy Stewart, and Kim Novak. Set in San Francisco with beautiful scenery, a plot unravels where you will be drawn in, and hooked to the conclusion. This is a suspenseful film from beginning to end.This is beautifully filmed, from the camera work, to the use of colour, and the film score adds greatly to the drama. This is a thrilling and clever film. The characters are whole and interesting, and Stewarts performance is compelling, and really marks him as one of the great actors. Kim Novak puts in a performance that is one of the best leads I've seen by a female actress.All round this is a wonderful, delightful film, with a in depth look at the human psyche, that has a strong resonance.Doesn't get a 10 because, i'm a film buff and very stingy."

Blew my teenage mind away.And when the film company came to a town next door, in Salina, Kansas, with Kim Novak, to film ""Picnic"", I was in shock. In vertigo, when Novak shows, Stewart, her driver's license, it says, Salina, Kansas.""Vertigo"" just gets better each time I see it. And with the new restoration of the print and soundtrack, now on wide screen DVD, well thank goodness I lived to see this happen.""Gone with the Wind"" was the first film I ever saw.What's cute bit of trivia, Kim Novak and Jimmy Steward, finished ""Vertigo"" and within a few weeks, turned around and did ""Bell, Book, and Candle"" and the contrast is amusing, and would make an interesting double feature.Hitchcock and Novak felt it was their best film, ever. How wonderful for us.Bernard Hermann's haunting musical score, is responsible for this film being a masterpiece. I have studied Hermann's history and his opera, ""Wuthering Heights"". ""Ghost and Mrs. Murir"" was Hermann's favorite film score, and of course, ""Vertigo""."

Vertigo is more than a brilliant suspense film; at its heart it is a story about obsession and the struggle to let go.James Stewart gives one of the great performances in the history of cinema with his dark portrayal of Scottie, an obsessed detective with a fear of heights. Kim Novak is also excellent as Madeleine, the woman at the center of Scottie's obsession. Hitchcock, with his pristine craft, utilizes his directorial abilities by using camera-techniques, fog filters, beautiful and rich colors, mirrors, and Bernard Herrmann's haunting musical score to help the audience journey into the mind of Scottie as well as to accentuate Scottie's journey into the depths of his obsession.Vertigo is one of the greatest films ever made and it is the ultimate testament to Hitchcock's brilliance."
Elizabeth-328,"Jan 31, 2000",N/A,"This movie is really great!  At the time of it's release, it was considered a disappointment, but now it's considered one of Hitchcock's finest.  I also think it's one of Jimmy Stewart's best performance, and is acting is incredible, especially at the end in the tower.  He starts shaking Madeline (Kim Novak) because he's so angry.  I think that part is very unlike Stewart, who usually played the nice guy who never lost his temper.  I also think the performance by Kim Novak is brilliant.  She was known as more of a sexy leading lady without really dramatic parts.  But in this, she really shows her ability to use her beauty to fool a man, and drive him to near insanity.""Vertigo"" is a wonderful movie, with a beautiful score.  Any Alfred Hitchcock fan really needs to see this, which many consider today to be his ""lost masterpiece""."
RJBurke1942,"Jan 2, 2013",6/10,"When I first saw this movie in 1959, I was bored to tears, almost. As a teenager, I wanted action, and the film and story seemed to be lacking in that regard. Only when Psycho (1960) came along did my appreciation of Hitchcock increase. As to Vertigo's story, the above short synopsis from filmfactsman provides sufficient information for those who haven't seen the movie.However, over fifty years later, I watched Vertigo for a second time and I must say my initial assessment was similar: the film's action drags with too much walking, shadowing and following, coupled with too much driving, following and shadowing. Appropriate jump-cutting could have been used a number of times – and shorten viewers' pains in the process, I think.On the flip side though, I can now fully appreciate Hitchcock's filming technique to show how Scottie Ferguson (James Stewart) grapples with the mystery of Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak) and how he unravels it. Though I'm sure there were more shot-reverse shot sequences in this movie than in any other of Hitchcock's.However, what the film truly lacks overall, in my opinion, is effective suspense – sufficient to keep this viewer fully interested in what will happen, and when and why. Hence, it's even a more of a puzzle to me why Vertigo has now replaced Citizen Kane (1941) as ""the best movie of all time"" (or words to that effect). Sure, both stories are mysteries, but the latter packs more of a punch for viewers from the get-go; and the revelation at the end provides greater dramatic irony than that in Vertigo. Indeed, one could argue that Vertigo's irony is weak, at best, and just corny at worst.Moreover, one wonders how a supposedly intelligent ex-cop could be so stupid to be sucked in twice by the same – but different – woman. Love is blind, I guess, as always.And, finally, the entire story of Vertigo is just too predictable, in addition to having a dialog that's just plain dull much of the time. Technically, as I implied, the actual filming is excellent, as you would expect from Hitchcock; and the color is just so vividly vibrant. But that's not enough for me to regard it as anything more than just that: a well-constructed film with few errors.James Stewart – always more effective in comedy and westerns, in my opinion – is just not right for the role. Kim Novak, on the other hand, is most effective, providing her best acting role that I've seen. And, as always, Barbara Bel Geddes is a most suitable supporting player as one of Stewart's old flames.I'm glad I've seen the movie again. And I do recommend it for all Hitchcock fans, for sure. But it's no where near his best effort: too long, too slow, too predictable and too light on suspense. Give this one six out of ten – and I'm being generous.January 2nd, 2013"
yavkaconsult,"Dec 18, 2023",5/10,"What a great mystery thriller... At least until the middle of it. What happened? Why? A perfectly told story halfway through the film that deserves huge admiration. It's all told and presented very well without stumbling over being something very great. It grabbed my interest and I got into the story very quickly with an interest to find out what would happen.Of course, as in many movies, the story totally fell apart - cliched scenes and twists, over the top attempts to enchant the viewer that something very interesting is happening, and in the end, ONE THING happens.The characters start acting inadequately, unrealistically, and it really pissed me off.In the end, I give the film my average score because the vertigo effect used here is itself directed and shot brilliantly.

But aside from the carefully woven plot line, its the little nuances of this film that really grab hold of you.There is much debate between this film and Rear window as to which film is visually superior. What makes rear window stunning is the camera work and the set of course. But rear window is confined to a single set, and makes the possibilities limited. Which leads to my point. Vertigo's cinematography is beautiful enough to entice even the most icy of viewers. This film invokes more emotion than any other film I've seen before - and this cannot be attributed entirely to the plot line, but the visual style with which it was filmed. From the sweeping camera over San Francisco, to Kim Novak's face against the red plush background of Ernie's interior, to the overhead shot of the stairs and hallway in the hotel, to the ethereal shot of the Golden Gate bridge, the placements and angles of the camera are flawless. Obviously Hitchcocks visions came alive in this one."
cheeseychocomunky8,"Mar 24, 2005",10/10,"This movie is considered to be the Master of Suspense's greatest achievement in film, and also James Stewart's greatest. Everything in the film is great. Bernard Herrmann's hypnotizing musical score is fascinating! Hitchcock's zoom-in, zoom-out camera work is absolutely fantastic!. Also, the acting is very good. Even though Kim Novak was not supposed to play the leading female role she still did a great job (Vera Miles was supposed to play the role, but she got pregnant).The ending will leave the viewer FLAT. If you enjoy a great suspense movie, or even a good romantic film you will LOVE this movie. You'll be raving about it in the water cooler."
boblipton,"Jan 8, 2006",10/10,"I feel a need to tell you a short anecdote about seeing this movie. When it was restored in the late 1990s, the New York premiere took place at the Ziegfeld. I managed to wangle my way in and saw so much in this movie I hadn't seen before, that can't really be seen except on the big screen.... and when I left the theater, I saw couples coming out..... and three or four women slapped the men they were with.Now it seemed to me clear that they felt that they had undergone some of the transformations imposed on the Kim Novak character by the Jimmy Stewart character for the sake of their relationships and bitterly resented it.... but it seemed to me that Stewart was also transformed by the relationship. In fact, he was destroyed by the relationship.... and was his acquiescence at all voluntary? Yet people do not see the sacrifices that others make for love, they only see their own, and they regret them bitterly.... and that, it seems to me, is that what this movie is about: the forces and twists and turns, the ignoring the clear signs, the self destruction at so many levels that love drives us to. This cynical, manipulative movie about absolute love.Three or four big, hairy men slapped by women. And taking it. Who had been dragged unwillingly into a different personality for the sake of love?"
middleburg,"Jul 18, 2006",10/10,"What an extraordinary experience it is to see this movie in the cinema. Having scene the film as a youngster on an old black and white TV set sitting on a couch with a bunch of young cousins, we were all transfixed. I remembered the story line and the disorienting experience, and how captivated I was by the mystery story for years. I remember that we had to leave my aunt and uncle's home before the final twist of the film was revealed--and I made my aunt promise to watch the film and let me know how it ended. Well, she obviously didn't see the film, as I called her up when we got home, and she told me that the man and woman fell in love and the movie ended with them nice and happy!! So for 30 years, that's how I thought Vertigo ended. Then in the early 1980's I saw the film in its famous re-release as it was garnering its new found critical and commercial acclaim, in all its glorious color, with a New York City audience laughing and clapping and getting so amazingly caught up in this grand cinematic experience. It was, simply put, awesome!There are scenes in this film that are so unique, so surprising , that they genuinely take the breath away. The two shots of Madeleine, as a beautiful goddess-like figure in Ernie's restaurant, viewed from Scotty's perspective in the distance, then up-close as she glides by as if in a dream; the shot of Madeleine reappearing after Scottie's initially humorous, but then uncomfortably obsessive make-over, filmed in a glowing, hazy light, with Bernard Herrmann's ravishing film score welling up in waves of sonorous passion; the surprisingly long sequence without almost any dialog in which Scotty trails Madeleine, containing one gorgeous moment after another - the back-door opening up onto the kaleidoscopic colors of the flower shop, the mysterious silence in the grandeur of the museum; the gorgeous views of San Francisco - the monuments, the colors, the vistas; the truly dreamlike scene in the middle of the towering, dark redwoods; and that vision of the Golden Gate Bridge where Scotty ""saves"" Madeleine - it took truly masterful film-making to take an iconic American image, and present it on screen in such a spectacular and unique manner.But the film is not merely a ""museum film"" where art direction and cinematography are the most important element. In Vertigo, the story is a ""page turner"". We are watching each of the characters, absolutely fascinated with the twists and turns that abound. The engaging humor, the riveting suspense, the intriguing story line all stem from the manner in which Hitchcock presents the three main characters: - the physically and psychically crippled hero of James Stewart, the enigmatic, but unbelievably alluring heroine of Kim Novak, and the adorable, humorous, lively, human and humane Barbara Bel Geddes - we care deeply for all three of them, tangled in this complex spiral of inevitable sadness and tragedy.I loved the film having seen only 2/3rds of it as a kid, and I now know this film as a great and enduring piece of American Cinema, a true classic."
k_d_f_l,"Jan 1, 2005",10/10,"This is the best movie ever, with more depth than I have ever seen. In 2003, I flew from New York to San Francisco just to see the sights in the movie.Scottie's (Jimmy Stewart's) apartment is located at 900 Lombard Street (corner of Jones), one block downhill from the famous crooked street. The door is no longer red, but the doorbell and mailbox are still in the same place. The bushes have definitely grown! Seeing this apartment gave me chills. You would recognize it even if you didn't have the address.Coit Tower can be seen from the apartment as in the movie.Madeline's (Kim Novak's) apartment is located at 1000 Mason Street. It looks the same.The Misson San Juan Bautista is 100 miles south of San Francisco. It was creepy. There is not a bell tower there. The eucalyptus trees that Scotty and Madeline drove through (the divided highway) to get there is actually a few minutes south of San Juan Bautista. Therefore, they would not have passed through that area on their way from San Francisco to San Juan Bautista.A person at Mission Deloris showed me where the headstone was located in the movie. It was eerie.I had a picture of me taken at the Palace of the Legion of Honor, sitting on the bench where Kim Novak sat. Also, they have a great Vertigo scrapbook for visitors to look at.Scotty and Judy walked outside of the Palace of Fine Arts. It looked the same.Muir Woods looked the exact same. The sign that Madeline pointed to and said ""This is when I was born. This is when I died"" is there. The steep mountain to get there is real.Fort Point does not have the steps that were shown in the movie.Ernie's restaurant is no longer there.What a trip! I took tons of photos."

masonrnewberry,"Jul 26, 2019",6/10,"I heard nothing but great things about this film, and that it was a masterpiece, it's not. The acting is subpar, the script is long and boring, the direction was decent. Jimmy Stewart was not right for this part at all. It's worth a watch, but it's no masterpiece"
MickyG333,"Jun 30, 2025",7/10,"6.9 stars.I see why it had all the mixed reviews when released in 1958. The plot is weak. It's a mystery, but not a clever one. It's more of a love story between the audience and Novak.Jimmie Stewart had opportunities to be on screen with the most beautiful women. For some reason, that was his thing and it definitely attracted large audiences. Look at all his best films, the leading ladies are supermodel quality. Unfortunately, he's about twice her age and that's difficult to justify for any romance.Enough about that. This film lacks in so many areas when it comes to plot and dialogue. I would normally rate this about 5.5, however it makes up for shortcomings with great cinematography, music, directing and editing. It's a prime movie, a huge production, best of the best, but when it comes to entertainment value and intellectual stimulation, it's sorely lacking.I don't want to spoil the plot, because basically anything I say about it will give it away. It's about a man with a minor disability who is tricked by a man and a woman, and the outcome is that he sort of goes mad. And when he figures it all out, no good can come of it. It's really quite depressing.If you haven't yet seen 'Vertigo', don't expect any spellbinding twists. There were many films with better twists in the 1950s."
mianaliilyas786,"Apr 19, 2006",10/10,"This movie is a trademark specialty of Hitchcock. Again his movie hero (Jimmy Stewart) is not a normal person but is haunted by height phobia and is about to enter into the most bizarre experience of his life. As the name suggest the movie throttles your mind at its best. Due to nature of the script the movie is slow tempered from the first half but its sure that it will mesmerizes you. The most significant aspect of the movie is that it keeps you continuously in the whirlpool of tension and ambiguity .You never know how the movie will end and this is the best part! Jimmy Stewart is once more very much convincing and Kim Novak also delivers her best performance, and no words to adjudicate Alfred Hitchcock's immaculate direction .The movie is 10/10"
killservant,"Jun 12, 2008",10/10,"Vertigo is a masterpiece. There is no denying that. The entire film is as dizzying to watch as the fear that it tackles, from the whirling opening credits by Saul Bass to the deeply haunting romantic score by Bernard Herrmann. When I first watched 'Vertigo', I will admit that I didn't like it. I was expecting a typical thriller like so many others, such as Psycho and North By Northwest. This film is much deeper, and is very complex psychologically. Stewart gives a terrifying performance of a man stumbling deeper and deeper into a dream world of obsession, and Hitchcock's use of color is extraordinary, and this is shown in a surreal dream sequence that is more terrifying than any other. What is most startling about 'Vertigo' is its genuine emotion throughout. It is not to be classified as a traditional 'happy entertainment' film. So do watch this, and be bowled over by its genius, but you might need a stiff drink afterward."
alice liddell,"Apr 12, 2000",10/10,"No superlatives.  VERTIGO turns in one itself.  Yes it's 'about' cinema, about the male spectator especially, about the self-destructive passivity of active desire.  Like 'The Great Gatsby', its corresponding text in literature, VERTIGO  is about illusory lives, dreams, and the unattainable girl.  But VERTIGO complicates this.  VERTIGO is not told only from the point of view of Scottie, or the omniscient 'narrator'/director who subtly undermines him.  VERTIGO, unlike 'Gatsby', or 'Lolita', gives its heroine a voice.  We are allowed to see what she sees and thinks.  Scenes are coloured by her emotion, just as they are for Scottie.  See how they both visualise Ernie's, for example: Scottie's expansive, enquiring, free point of view and Judy's broken, Sirkian, experience, foregounding intruding decor and different levels, like shattered fragments.VERTIGO is Judy's tragedy - Scottie is actually offered a woman who will love him early, who will humiliate, negate, even kill herself for him; Judy loves someone who doesn't even know she exists.  But her Scottie doesn't exist either - like Heathcliff awaiting his Cathy, he is in another realm. Her cramped ordinary room for her is a suitcase, a wardrobe, a wallet, photos; for Scottie it is a magical, fairy-tale, substance-less cave, where once again time collapses, and talk of 'three years' is irrelevant."
alice liddell,"Apr 12, 2000",10/10,"VERTIGO reveals itself three times during the film - it encapusulates itself, shows us what will happen before it happens, future and past in the present - it interprets the future, but we only know once our experience (watching the film) is past.  The opening credits - lips, James Stewart; eyes, Kim Novak, into the eyes of woman, not as fleshly human being, but man-made illusion - vast, black, abyss, geometrical patterns which only repeat, visualising the labyrinth, the white pattern that looks like a shroud, the changing colours like Scottie's dream.The opening sequence.  Scottie chases criminal over San Francisco rooftops at night.  Scottie follows, criminal escapes, 'innocent' falls to death. Scottie, even when most in control, following someone else, being driven by himself.  Scottie follows Maddie the night after he rescues her, through the same old San Francisco streets, baffled.  She leads him to his own house, to himself.  Scottie, after he has made up Judy into Maddie, the circular kiss, the anxiety, the stable."
madmad,"May 22, 2002",N/A,"I just read an incorrect comment on this movie.Andrew 162 remarked about the ""shape of the church tower"" and referred to its location as San Francisco.  In fact, that adobe building, is Mission San Juan Bautista, which is about 100 miles south of San Francisco off Hwy 101. The Coroner's Jury scene is also filmed in the same town, in one of the historic buildings there.  Mission San Juan is one of the original California missions, and is the oldest continuously operating church in the state.The bell tower in the movie was a set constructed by Hitchcock, there was no bell tower there at the time, but there is one there now, which was constructed since.Lastly, the scene in the automobile in which they are ""driving down"" to San Juan Bautista, the divided highway with the eucalyptus trees, is actually still there, but it is located south of San Juan Bautista on the way to Salinas, so they would not have passed that stretch of highway between San Francisco and San Juan Bautista.Maybe this is ""too much information,"" but I had to get it out there."
ferdinand1932,"Sep 20, 2010",6/10,"Despite it's elevated status, which has come from criticism and academic analysis, Vertigo remains a boring experience, even with many interesting thematic facets.Hitchcock told Truffaut that the interest/suspense in Vertigo is what Scottie might do. That question had been the bedrock of Hitchcock's cinema but Scottie as played by Stewart is too ambiguous; he is reactive and weak. The lack of vigor in the character makes his falling love with with Madeleine barely believable, and his constant pleading with her is altogether too weak.Compounding the problems is the plot, the structural mechanism, of the story that is also not believable. The orchestration of the scheme requires credibility and here it is strained: the choice of policeman; the discovery of Judy etc it's rather like those English mysteries that Raymond Chandler mocked because it is contingent on rare elements to bind the entire piece together.And Novak's performance, which despite a reappraisal recently, seems to demonstrate that she never really progressed beyond the nervous rabbit role play at drama school. She is , as the expression has it, wise with a closed mouth, but once she speaks the mystery is gone. Her eyebrows are also quite frightening.Vertigo has great music, locations and an intriguing idea for a story (one that would have been gripping in a novel); but equally it has dull driving scenes, over written dialog (Pop's story in the bookstore) and two lead actors who are far from ideal. This is one film when the themes and not the material on screen excites comment, and more film Phds no doubt, but it is pretentious miss in Hitchcock's golden decade."
Movieguy-47,"Jul 31, 1999",10/10,"This may come as a shock to some people reading this, but I'm quite a big Hitchcock fan and ""Vertigo,"" in my opinion, is not his best film. ""Rear Window"" is the finest feature he ever made, and ""Psycho"" was his most purely entertaining (although I would rank the famous horror film third, after ""Rear Window"" and ""Vertigo"").James Stewart plays a private detective who is hired to follow a beautiful blond (Kim Novak) whom he quickly falls in love with. She commit suicide (or did she?) and, later on in the film, the Stewart character finds the glowing image of her in an equally beautiful redhead. I won't give away anything else.Now don't get me wrong, ""Vertigo"" is a near-excellent film that I love and cherish. Most ""Vertigo"" detractors say the film can be seen from too many different points of views  (surreal dream, detective story, romance, etc.) and that is has no clear narrative flow. Actually, I like that aspect of the movie. My problem with ""Vertigo"" is a more primitive one; I just think the buildup to the blond's suicide is too long and worked up. ""Vertigo"" may be a near-great movie, but it's not one I could watch over and over again. Not Rated. 128 minutes. 9 out of 10."
EdwardCarter,"Mar 4, 2011",1/10,"The use of colour is probably the only good thing about this slow and boring, overlong, dated film. The first half is much too long and slow and the repetitive driving scenes quickly become very tiresome. Kim Novak was always a poor actress, and looks ridiculous with her bleached platinum blond hair and thick dark eyebrows. Far too many scenes take place in the studio on very fake looking sets with painted backdrops. The opening scene is ruined because it is so fake, not that cops would be chasing a criminal over rooftops anyway. By far the worst thing however is the dreadful miscasting of Grandfather Stewart as Scottie. Stewart was clearly far too old to be playing romantic leads at this point in his career and he was actually more than twice Kim Novak's age (she was 24 and he was 49, though he looked at least 55). His grey wig is laughably bad and he just looks like an ugly old man chasing after his granddaughter. With a younger, better looking actor like Marlon Brando the film might have at least been watchable."
PWNYCNY,"Aug 1, 2014",10/10,"This movie features incredibly powerful acting by the two stars, James Stewart and Kim Novak. In fact, this story is so actor-driven that it is unlikely that with different actors the movie would have been as nearly as powerful. Stewart plays a character, Scotty, who is being cruelly manipulated by two people for ulterior purposes that become apparent only later in the movie. What drives the story forward is the interaction between Scotty and the woman, Madeleine, whose deviousness is only matched by her own emotional vulnerability. Emotions become confused as victim and manipulator become more involved. Besides being arguably James Stewart's most emotionally evocative performance, it propels the movie to a dramatic crescendo that is completely engaging. It is virtually impossible for an audience not to empathize with Scotty's emotional torment. Yet, what makes the movie even more provocative is the way in which the two characters are portrayed - as people with whom one can identify. Scotty and Madeleine are plausible characters. Without going into detail, suffice it that Kim Novak gives the best performance of her career. The cinematography is excellent. This is a great movie."
zoltan-wang,"Nov 16, 2015",10/10,"Who says exposure of mystery or not is the key to distinguish Thriller and Mystery? In fact, I felt them both in this movie! As plot goes by, I discovered the truth with protagonist. Then at the end it caught my breath. I was wondering what he would do and what could possibly happen.I've been always unwilling to watch movies in old days, thinking they are old and might be unacceptable. To be specific, the cinematography is absolutely not as beautiful as today, and the edit is now like today's style — fast-pacing. So many times I chose to watch some ordinary ones in current age instead of some classic ones in old days. But that's so wrong! As time goes by and technology develops, what's left for the next generation would always be the best. Those average- quality ones would simply be replaced by the best. So for now, most of the movies would be regarded as trash maybe in hundreds of years later. Then why waste time watching them if I'm not enjoying them?So, only look for those movies which can make you enjoy - the fantastic story the movie tells - the way the director represents the story - the work of editor and cinematographer that makes it an art - the great performance of those actor and actressBack to this movie, the reasons I love it stated below. Its dialogue is designed so natural. I don't know whether it is just the style they talked in 50's or not. For me, overall, it looks natural. And the other thing is they keep connecting to the next topic they wanna talk about or the next plot that's gonna happen. And it is so fluent.Actress is so beautiful. I've always heard that in Hitchcock's movies, actress would always be beautiful blonds. Haven't got a chance to see that. We'll see.The editing and filming is actually far better than I expected, since you know it's a 1958 movie..In a word, it is so great! And now I get to understand why people would talk about Hitchcock's movies a lot and regard him as one of the greatest directors in film history."
gftbiloxi,"May 21, 2005",10/10,"As much ""art"" film as Hollywood product, VERTIGO was generally savaged by critics upon its release; today it is widely regarded as Hitchcock's single finest film. The story is extremely well known: a retired police detective with an incapacitating fear of heights, Scottie, is engaged to shadow a beautiful woman, Madeline, whose husband suspects her of being suicidal. Scottie soon becomes obsessive about Madeline--but circumstances quickly spin out of control, and his love turns to tragedy and madness.Unlike most Hitchcock films, VERTIGO unfolds slowly, drawing the viewer into the relationship between Scottie and Madeline at the same pace as the characters experience it. At the same time, Hitchcock presents the viewer with a number of visual motifs (such as the famous spirals found in the film) to reinforce the increasingly disturbed nature of the story. As the film progresses, VERTIGO develops a powerfully hypnotic quality rather like the dreamed nightmare of a slow-motion fall.To a certain extent, the stars of VERTIGO are cast against type. This is particularly true of James Stewart, who is best known as the All-American Everyman, and his performance as the increasingly neurotic Scottie is all the more disturbing for our knowledge of his more typical performances. Although usually noted more for beauty than for acting ability, Kim Novack gives a remarkable and extremely believable turn in what is easily the finest performance of her career. The supporting cast--which includes particularly fine performances by Barbara Bel Geddes and Konstantin Shayne--is also excellent, and Bernard Hermann's excellent score adds tremendous dimension to the film.Some viewers, particularly those enamoured of such rapid-fire Hitchcock romps as TO CATCH A THIEF and NORTH BY NORTHWEST, may find themselves impatient with the film's leisurely pace; some viewers will themselves unable to see beyond the twists in the script to grasp Hitchcock's statement on obsessive love. But for most viewers--myself included--this is ""the"" Hitchcock film, the great masterpiece by a director renowned for masterpieces. A personal favorite, and very highly recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
screamingmarsupial,"Nov 27, 2004",N/A,"First off, Great movie but I still think that North by Northwest was better (mostly because of the comical elements in it). The plot structure was set up in a way that can only be referred to as Hitchcock. The movie was split into two three act stories divided by the death of Madeleine. Particularly interesting was the fact that these two stories mirror each other and both end with a death in the convent. Hitchcock has a way of creating suspenseful situations that many modern film makers attempt to reproduce. I love the end when Jimmy Stewart's character is getting more and more irate when suddenly a dark figure appears in the doorway and scares Madeleine. Who knew that nuns could be so freaky. Also, Hitchcock blended elements of French Impressionism and Classic Hollywood styles together to create a simply genius film that I would recommend to everyone."
oyason,"Aug 10, 2008",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's VERTIGO is one of the greatest suspense films ever made. The director was at the top of his form with this work, which highlights intimate obsession bordering on necrophilia, which is a theme unusual in the time and place this movie was produced ( a U.S. studio in the late 1950s),but also Hitchock's amazingly ghoulish humor.Scotty Fergusen (Jimmy Stewart) is a private investigator who is recently retired from the city police force over an incident on the job that resulted in the death of a colleague and a pronounced fear of heights in Fergusen. Scotty is financially independent and has some support in the friendship of his confidant and former fiancé' Midge (Barbara Bel Geddes). His life and what's left of his emotional stability begin to be challenged when he is contracted by wealthy shipping magnate Gavin Elster (Tom Elmore) to track the doings of his wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who has developed an obsession with the history of a tragic ancestor that now borders on the fantastic and suicidal. Or so Scotty is led to believe. What follows from the investigation is a star-crossed romance which assumes a surreal and sometimes folkloric dimension from the get-go, and which culminates in a post-mortem fantasy that will immolate not only Scotty, but the fortunes of working girl Judy Barton (Kim Novak in an interesting role within a role).If you've not seen this film, I will only tell you that Hitchcock demonstrates the truth of his masterful reputation as a movie maker through a precipitous wrap-up that left me crying I was laughing so hard, but I'm pretty twisted. All I'm going tell you is that I can't believe he got away with that back in 1958, and that in whatever realm the creatures of imagination reside, Midge is going to be bringing Scotty crayons to play with for a long time.By far and away, this one easily rates for me as one of the best films overall ever made, and if you like classic suspense film from the greats, this is one you can't miss. Here is one more good example of why special effects by themselves do not a solid motion picture make, which is a sad reality lost on all too many filmmakers and their audiences these days."
lewiskendell,"Aug 8, 2010",7/10,"""Go up the stairs. Go up the stairs, Judy, and I'll follow.""How far, how deep into obsession can love for a woman drive a man? That's the very question that Alfred Hitchcock tackles in this twisty thriller.Having little knowledge of the plot of Vertigo is even more necessary than the average Hitchcock movie, so I'll reveal as little as possible. Jimmy Stewart plays an ex-detective who is convinced by an old friend to secretly follow his wife (Kim Novak), who has been acting strangely. What comes next is a completely unpredictable and dark tale of love, death, deceit, and obsession.The only thing that keeps Vertigo from being amongst my favorite Hitchcock movies is its uneven quality. The tone of the first half of the movie is quite different from the second half, and while that makes complete sense within the context of the story, I found the latter portion to be much more entertaining, as a result. The ending ranks right there with Notorious and The Birds as the most memorable that Alfred ever did.This was the first Hitchcock movie I ever saw, and in hindsight, it was a great one to begin with. Vertigo's mixture of mystery and darkness is a perfect introduction to the legendary director, and it fully deserves the sterling regard that it's earned over the years."
DrewAlexanderR1,"Aug 13, 2015",9/10,"Vertigo is one of the perfect examples of a film that will always stand the test of time and one that should never be remade. Alfred Hitchcock is a genius and has many excellent films under attached to his resume. Psycho is the one synonymous with his name but Vertigo is arguably his best directed piece.Scottie Ferguson (Jimmy Stewart) is a retired detective who dwells over a failed case. An old friend, Gavin Elster (Tom Helmore), goes to Scottie and asks him to investigate his wife, Madeleine Elster (Kim Novak), who he thinks is cheating on him. Scottie accepts with the hope this will allow him to put the past to rest, but it turns into a twisted obsession that engulfs him.This film was glossed over at the Academy Awards in 1959. But today the film will always stick out for its directing, the superb screenplay, and the amazing performance of Jimmy Stewart. These factors make this film a classic and give it top shelf status even still, today.Vertigo sets the bar for a lot of thrillers today and many directors and writers have taken lessons and paid homage to this film. If you haven't seen this film yet, don't read anything about it. Go into the movie and get lost in where the story takes you."
henrymadman,"Jul 4, 2007",10/10,"Vertigo is a 1958 psychological thriller directed by Alfred Hitchcock. The film features James Stewart, Kim Novak and Barbara Bel Geddes. The film tells the story of a Vertigo sufferer and police detective, John Ferguson, who believes that his newly found girlfriend is a reincarnation of a possessed woman who he saw commit suicide in the San Francisco Bay, after being assigned to investigate what was wrong with her. Both women are portrayed by Novak.It was premiered in the San Sebastian International Film Festival on May 8, 1958, where it was received poorly, polarising both critics and commercial audiences. However, as the film aged, it has become one of the most recognised, acclaimed American films ever made. In 1989, Vertigo was recognised as a ""culturally, historically and aesthetically significant"" film by the National Film Registry and subsequently restored internationally in 1996."
jasonsurety,"Aug 20, 2003",10/10,"The colors in Vertigo almost seem brighter than life.  Living in San Francisco and watching this movie I couldn't help but wish I had lived here in 1958.  The quality of picture is not the only thing noticeable.  Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak are outstanding.  The premise is made believable by the two stars and the way Hitch continually shows Stewart observing Novak from afar:  growing more and more intrigued. The premise?  An ex-detective(Stewart) is called on by an old friend to follow his wife.  The man is afraid his wife is literally possessed. Stewart doesn't believe this at first, but the more he watches Novak the more uncertain he becomes."
namashi_1,"Feb 28, 2014",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock, a master of horror/thrillers, delivers A Fine Psychological Thriller with his much-loved classic 'Vertigo'. A claustrophobic, puzzling tale, that works in many ways.'Vertigo' Synopsis: A retired San Francisco detective suffering from acrophobia investigates the strange activities of an old friend's wife, all the while becoming dangerously obsessed with her.'Vertigo' has everything going for it, except, for its mercilessly slow-pacing. Sure, not every story needs to be fast-paced, but at least there needs to be proper pacing. The only minus point of 'Vertigo' is its pacing.But coming to the winning points, Hitchcock creates a world of doubt & deceiving with dexterity. He Directs this difficult human-tale, authoritatively. Alec Coppel & Samuel A. Taylor's Screenplay offers delicious twists & turns, which engross its viewer effectively. Cinematography is picture-perfect. Editing is dull.Performance-Wise: James Stewart enacts his part with gusto. Kim Novak is highly competent.

Horror-yo,"Jun 28, 2016",7/10,"As with many such films, this one starts out with a very intriguing premise which tension only builds up as the elements of the plot flourish more and more towards the middle of the development... before stalling some during the last third of the film, somewhat toning down the fine quality of the early viewing. This film is too long for its own good, and has a bit of a rare 'symptom' of peaking too soon. It seems all the pressure fomented in the first hour is already resolved well before the final act of the film, and although there is certainly matter to the second half of the story, a lot of the essential atmosphere and purpose the film was subtly weaving for a while are put to sleep before a different kind of tone or 'color' (*wink wink*) completely takes over - one that is much more obvious, ordinary, maybe somewhat tedious. The first half is so mysterious, intimate, smooth, suspenseful, hauntingly romantic... and all this is traded away for a more conventional affair. Finally, the very title of the film seems a little misleading if not a lot, especially given this is a Hitchcock, where one would really expect something different and isn't necessarily given a worthy compensation for it. Overall, it's a fine film, but weaker in some respects than it seems it is given credit for."
Wyatt-9,"Jul 24, 1999",3/10,"Vertigo has all the makings of a masterpiece except one: a compelling story. The twist is blatantly obvious twenty minutes into the film, and the romance of the film falls completely flat, so to speak.  Ultimately, for all of Hitchcock's vibrant colors, striking camera angles, and the thrilling dream sequence, we simply do not care whether the characters live or die. Overall, a very disappointing film, but worth watching nevertheless for fans of Hitchcock's work.  Vertigo is a remarkable instance of the whole being less than the sum of its parts."
vvva,"Jul 14, 2000",9/10,"Hitchcock really proves that he is the best and most popular director with this film as it one of the best movies ever. The movie starts out intriguing and when the main plot twist occurs, you are left breathless and thinking you're in a completely different movie with a different plot. Watch This one as it is a great motion picture and will leave you astounded."
Jonas-5,"Jul 16, 1999",10/10,"Hitchcock's masterpiece about a retired police detective with fears of heights. He is hired by a friend to shadow his wife which has acted very strange lately.This is a movie that demands very much of the viewer. You have to watch all of the movie - and you certainly will. Because this movie will spellbind you for two hours.Many critics think the first half hour is slow and many minutes could have been cut. But in fact these scenes are necessary for the whole movie to work. And by the way, the beginning is not boring. It's like the beginning of Psycho - it slowly builds up and is therefore necessary to understand the whole picture.The movie is like a boiling soup that will boil over at any minute. Both Psycho and Vertigo explode in the end (not a bomb!). Leaving the audience stunned by the end. (Like Norman's corpses in Psycho) and Jeff (James Stewart in Vertigo).Vertigo is definitely one of the best movies ever made. YOU MUST SEE IT!!! I had to watch it twice to understand what a masterpiece this is.Jonas Sörensen, August -98"
Artimidor,"May 13, 2012",10/10,"""Vertigo"" is one of those killer combinations where just about everything fits like a glove. For one there's the ingenious screenplay by Alec Coppel and Samuel Taylor based on the French novel ""D'Entre les Morts""(usually translated as ""From the Realm of the Dead""). It's a spellbinding narration of a retired San Francisco police detective who gets caught up in mysterious events with supernatural undertones, peppered by deception, betrayal, crime and obsession. Then there's the cast: John ""Scottie"" Ferguson is played in understated fashion by James Stewart, the epitome of the humble, humane gentleman and good friend who cannot deny a favor. Confronting him with mystifying blond sexbomb Kim Novak really gets things rolling and is electrifying to see. Every moment of the main characters' difficult relationship throughout the film is absolutely believable and their chemistry on screen evident and riveting. In the music department Bernard Herrmann once again outdoes himself with an engrossing score, which will make you hold your breath in anticipation of what lies ahead - or hit you right in the face whenever necessary, and that's a good thing. The cinematography? Pitch perfect. Locations like the Golden Gate Bridge shine in all their Technicolor glory as do striking camera shots like the one from the roof at the very beginning or those from the Old Mission San Juan Bautista bell tower.All the brilliance is carefully constructed and well held together by master director Alfred Hitchcock himself, who knows how to pull one into the film, how to get into the characters, how to make one dizzy (with style!) - and how to zoom in while at the same time physically pulling the camera back, the astonishing trademark shot of ""Vertigo"". A film to be watched again and again, practically flawless and all the way masterfully executed."

It's extraordinary to see an old film like that, that went through a lot, to have excellent picture quality and sound!  James Stewart and Kim Novak are absolutely magnificent together.

mcsheehey,"Sep 29, 2007",10/10,"""Vertigo"" is perhaps Hitchcock's most twisted film, but it is also one of his best, as well as one of the best films ever made. Everything about the film is pitch-perfect. I won't disclose plot details here so as not to spoil anyone who hasn't seen the film yet, but I will say the following.The casting in ""Vertigo"" could have failed miserable had it not been done in such a careful manner. Jimmy Stewart is probably the most likable actor in film history, which makes him the only person in the world who could have played the main role in this film without repulsing the audience. He keeps the main role of Scotty afloat for the entire film when no other actor could've done the same with such a twisted role. The same could be said of Kim Novak, who portrays the leading lady perfectly, managing to appear devious and sympathetic in alternating frames. Still, my favorite performance of the film is that of the role of Midge. Barbare plays this desperate friend of Scotty's in such a sympathetic way that we almost want Scotty to run off and marry her, even if it means ruining the film.""Vertigo"" is a well-made film all around. The cinematography is creepy and enchanting, as is the beautifully composed script. Of course, the real star of the film id=s the classic Bernard Hermann score, which is one of his best, probably second only to the score for ""Psycho."" In ""Vertigo,"" Hitchcock masterfully proves that he is not solely a murder mystery director, and that he can create suspense even in a love affair between two deeply troubled characters. It's twisted, certainly, but it has to be. It's a fantastic film and one of the master's best."
brchthethird,"Aug 10, 2015",10/10,"I like to be in a good frame of mind when starting a film, because if distracted, it will affect the way I process it. So, after a few false starts, I finally have seen VERTIGO, and what I feel to be the perfect example of a Hitchcock film. The story follows John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired San Francisco detective who is called by a friend to follow his wife. Along the way, he falls in love and has some curious experiences revolving around mistaken identity and his fear of heights. Dare I say that James Stewart hasn't been better (at least in a Hitchcock film) than here. Kim Novak also acquits herself rather nicely in the typical Hitchcock blonde role, although I still think Grace Kelly is a slightly better actress. All of Hitchcock's tricks are put to full use here, and things start off brilliantly with my favorite title sequence so far. Saul Bass and Bernard Herrmann were two of Hitch's greatest collaborators, and they certainly did some of their best work here. From a story perspective, the narrative takes a number of twists and turns which a discerning viewer will probably figure out beforehand, but its the execution of said twists that really make them work. They aren't telegraphed, but rather are hinted at or suggested. And if there's anything that makes a Hitchcock film extremely watchable, is how he is able to manipulate audience expectations through the power of suggestion. From a technical perspective, there was quite a bit of impressive camera-work and photographic effects that add to a sense of disorientation and suspense. In particular, there are a few zoom in/track out shots that visually illustrate James Stewart's character's acrophobia. There was also a really trippy dream sequence that served as a nice reprise of the opening title sequence. Even the production design, sets, costumes, etc. added to the visual splendor. Even when the narrative slows down (to ease the tension), there's always something beautiful to look at, be it a person or one of the many on-location shots of downtown San Francisco. And finally, Bernard Herrmann's score was pretty much perfect, helping to build tension at the right moments and backing off when necessary. A couple key moments in the film happen sans score, and the mark of a good composer is knowing which moments to back off and let the drama speak for itself. Put together, all of the various production elements form a package which, to me, is the epitome of what Hitchcock brought to cinema. You have interesting (and attractive) characters, a suspense-filled story, brilliant camera-work and a rapturous score. Even the ending this time felt better than in his other films. Although it would probably benefit someone new to Hitchcock to start with something earlier in his filmography (to get a sense of progression), VERTIGO is probably the pinnacle of his style and certainly essential when it comes to film classics."

At first she was supposed to be possessing Madeline, but then we find in the end we find she has nothing to do with Madiline. Do I just disregard her completely and her whole story about her or is there more to her then that? Also I had difficulties understanding the symbolism in the colors, what do they mean?

vithiet,"Oct 30, 2023",7/10,"Since it's always cited as one of Hitchcock's best I had to give it a try since I thoroughly enjoyed my recent experience watching Rear Window. But I have to say I found Vertigo to be quite inferior to be honest. Mostly, unlike Rear Window and other classic movies that stand the test of time, Vertigo really feels like a product of its time, from the characters to the dialogue, and even the questionable acting in some parts. There is still great directing and cinematography as you would expect, and it's a pretty decent thriller overall. But I would have a hard time recommending it to anyone, especially to younger people who are interested in great classic movies."
Scars_Remain,"Mar 22, 2008",10/10,"Every time I see this movie, it totally blows me away and leaves me with chills. It's very rare that a movie has that kind of effect on me. I could watch it over and over and not get sick of it because it's one of those movies where you pick up on new things every time you see it. It truly is one of the most brilliant films of all time.Jimmy Stewart rules, like always. I would say that he may be the greatest actor in history and put together with Hitchcock, he definitely couldn't go wrong. The story is perfectly crafted and a bit complex so be sure to pay attention when you see it. I cannot recommend this movie enough and you won't know what I'm talking about until you see it for yourself.Vertigo is a film that fully consumes the viewer. Any movie fan needs to see it.

However as time passed, Vertigo was met with vigorous excitement and favourability and has since become a classic, analysed and re-analysed so many times.The story of an acrophobic detective (James Stewart), who retires from the force and is later hired by a wealthy businessman to observe his wife's bizarre behaviour, claiming that she might be possessed. However, the truth is far from that as John 'Scottie' Ferguson realises as time passes and in true Hitchcockian fashion, the ride is thrilling from start to finish.Cinematic excellence, one of Hitchcock's finest films, highly recommended.10/10"
s_a_n_d_w_i_c_h_e_s,"Aug 17, 2007",N/A,This is the most boring film I have ever seen and you will think the same if you see it. This movie goes on forever and never stops ever until it ends. I wish this film had stayed away from me.It's all about an old guy in a car who is chasing a woman and that's it. There is more car driving in this film than in maybe a hundred other films all put together. He never even catches her! What a waste of time. I'm not allowed to tell you what happens later in the film but trust me you don't want to know. It's rubbish.The film looks so fake like a cartoon and it was about to make me laugh until I remembered how bored I was. I'd rather tidy my bedroom than see another minute of that old guy driving.

michaelheiser-25099,"Nov 8, 2021",6/10,"Good thriller. During my first viewing of the film I was very surprise by the excellent mature and patient directing of Hitchcock,which was very different to the style that I had expected,due to seeing ""spoof"" versions of famous Hitchcock films,where they made it look as if the camera would find it impossible to stay in one place. Thankfully Hitch is actually the complete opposite,with only using shots of Fergusions Vertigo during moments where the character is at some of his weakest moments. Hitchcock also uses the camera to show the destructive breakdown for each of the characters,With the truly unforgettable dream sequence Hichcock does amazingly well at showing how much damaged Madeleine has done to Scotties mental state,although Hitch shows that Madeleine also has to pay a price,with a very daring ending,that probably most directors even now, would not choose.Whilst I heard a few years ago about the now mis-quoted infamous quote about how Hitchcock through actors should be treated,with this amazing film,I think that it is very easy to actually see that Hitchcock wanted to get the best performances from the stunning cast. With the sadly underrated Kim Novak giving an astonishing performance as ""Madeleine"",who she shows "" may"" be struggling with a personality disorder,which Novak excellently shows to be slowly bubbling over into her life."
jfreak-alvaro,"Aug 8, 2008",10/10,"Those who are not sure of cinema-goers say that the best film Hitchcok is Psychosis. But in reality Vertigo has no rival.Hitchcok has been highlighted by his ideal of telling a story with emphasis on images rather than words. And without this place doubts it does so with a master's total.Vertigo is a love story that ends as only Hitchcok know, with the heart in his hand. Each plane and angle of the film is a delight to the eye of the viewer. Since planes that make long-shot look to the city of San Francisco as well as close-ups that until can make us feel on the skin of the protagonists.And in this case, Kim Novak and James Stwart are wonderful. It is the only film I've seen of this woman but I think it will enough. The chemistry that makes with Stwart is the best I've seen in my life. Although I believe the actions of James is millimeters below that Rear Window, the feeling of love that prints Novak into his character makes it unforgettable and unrivaled.But besides the fantastic direction of Hitchcok (as always, but this time is perfect), a dash with a perfectly structured and Finale of the best of all time makes this work the best his filmography."
eibon09,"Feb 15, 2000",10/10,"Although my favourite Hitchcock film is Strangers On A Train, this is his masterpiece as well as one of his darkest films since it deals with the theme of obsession.  This movie is the closest Hitch comes to fully expressing his inner demons to nearly being explicit.  The beginning of this film can be seen as a continuation of Rear Window.  Vertigo (1958) also deals with some similar themes explored in Rear Window (1954).  This is the third film that deals with a person's mental state.  The other two being Spellbound (1946), which dealt with a man's fear of white, and Marnie (1964), which dealt with the main character's fear of red.  This motion picture is a highlight of the director's fame career and should be considered on any top ten greatest films list."
stevenosterberg2,"Sep 15, 2024",6/10,"Good classic film. Two, the atmosphere Hicthcock invokes in this film is just right for the psychological tailspin that Stewart gets into, with the usage of lighting, real San Fransisco locations, and particularly the color green all to perfect, eerie effect. And three, there's Bernard Herrmann's score, on par with the Psycho score though maybe even better as a straight piece of classical music in the guise of tense, haunting movie music. It's also the kind of picture that is a MUST if you've already seen it, or even if not, and it comes around town on the big screen as all the images.A little too dark and depressing though6/10."
Det_McNulty,"May 20, 2007",10/10,"Many would argue that Vertigo is Hitchcock's true triumph, the film which defines his work and a film which has been a major influence on cinema as a whole. Vertigo is famous for many reasons; it is famous for being both a masterpiece and for being one of the most sexually-obsessive films ever made. As with most Hitchcock films sex is a frequently occurring and underlying theme, Hitchcock uses sexuality to propel the key narrative. Personally, I see Vertigo as an example of male-lust, obsession and perversion. Some might go as far as saying Vertigo is about Hitchcock's own attraction to women, which in Vertigo is dangerously perverse. Vertigo is a film which is open to interpretation and one which requires the utmost concentration. To fully gain the film's brilliance you need to first re-watch it, as the common trend is to be perplexed by the film's complex narrative structure.Vertigo continues to be one of the optimal psychological thrillers, a film which has stood the test of time and becomes greater and greater with age. Vertigo is the tale of ""Scottie"" (played by James Stewart), a San Francisco policeman who is haunted by his severe acrophobia, which is caused from the guilt of an accidental death he feels responsible for. Due to Scott's condition he feels confined to secluding himself from police work, until an old friend asks him a favour. The favour is to ""spy"" on his beautiful wife Madeleine (Kim Novak), who he has become suspicious off due to the idea that she is possessed by a dead relative. So, Scottie tracks down Madeline, while quickly becoming pulled inside a mysterious and menacing world of lies and obsession.There are countless occurring themes throughout Hitchcock's films, which include mistaken identity, voyeurism, obsession, sexual compulsion, reliance, absurdity, paradoxes, irony and perversion. All of these contribute to making Hitchcock's films some of the most analytically accessible. Vertigo is an example of just how fierce Hitchcock can be through the harsh tones that he has etched into the film. The delicate moments of brief intimacy in Vertigo are ones which become abruptly destroyed by painful sorrow. These moments are devastating, as you are watching a man become more and more entranced by a woman he is failing to grasp.Hitchcock uses hypnotically mesmerising camera work and dizzying lens filtering to create an unbearably ominous ""Hitchcockian"" environment. The stark colours, which are wonderfully vibrant, help to create a sincere mood of looming menace and tension. The use of perspective distortion (most notably the Dolly zoom) is another factor of the sublime skill behind the camera. When establishing the film's meaning you have to carefully annotate the use of colours, shadows and mirrors, which are all, used as metaphors for the protagonist's emotions and help to craft Scottie as one of the most multi-dimensional characters in cinematic history.With the additional blending of Bernard Herrmann's score you find yet another addition to add to the film's distinguishable quality at creating an extremely polarising and cold ambiance. Finally, you have the outstanding set-pieces and one in particular which will linger in the depths of your mind for eternity. What makes the set-pieces so perfect is how they are so remarkably appropriate for the essence of each scene.The acting from the entire cast is indistinguishable, in the sense that the acting is so sublime that it is actually too difficult to truly say who gave a better performance than the other. Although, I will certainly express how James Stewart's surprising casting as a fairly menacing character is one which remains one of the most unexpectedly perfected performances of all-time. He slides into the character with a cold-hearted and unnerving stance, providing insight into a multi-dimensional character which can be scrutinised to the finest detail for hours on end. Though, it is still not James Stewart's greatest performance (I would give It's a Wonderful Life the edge) it is unquestionably the finest film he ever starred in.Vertigo is the film which signifies Hitchcock's own persona, while categorically remaining his ultimate masterpiece. Few films can succeed in captivating and entrancing countless emotions upon its viewer. Vertigo is cinematic flawlessness."
drumplayer0908,"May 19, 2007",10/10,"I saw vertigo for the first time a few months ago and it is now tied for my favorite Hitchcock film (with rear window) and its the best film i've ever seen. Everything about it is amazingly put together and i think Hitchcock is pure genius. James Stewart one of my favorite actors is amazing as Scottie and Kim Novak is amazing as Madelaine and Judy. It's hard to pull off a dual role and i think she did it very well. If your just getting into Hitchcock then i recommend Vertigo for anyone who wants to be blown away, I mean it was just that amazing! Even the soundtrack by Bernard Herman is amazing, I even have it on CD. The music, the directing, the acting, the mystery, the suspense, and the hitchcocky feel make this movie one of the greatest ever."
bankofmarquis,"Jan 12, 2018",10/10,"If you've only encountered the films of Alfred Hitchcock through scary films like PSYCHO and THE BIRDS then you are missing out on the bulk of his work and some of the finest motion pictures ever made. I had the privilege of checking out one of his best films, VERTIGO, on the big screen as part of the EMAGINE WILLOW CREEK's SECRET CINEMA series - and what a treat it was.Starring Jimmy Stewart and Kim Novak, VERTIGO is a film about obsession, desire, deception and murder all told in a package by the great Hitchock that pops off the screen and into your brain. EVERY part of this film works and it still holds up 60 years after it's release.Stewart stars as John ""Scotty"" Ferguson a former Police Detective who must retire from the force because of his severe acrophobia (fear of heights) heightened by vertigo. He is asked by a friend to follow his wife, Madeleine (Kim Novak) for fear that she is suicidal. I won't spoil what happens from there, but Hitchcock puts us on the trail of a psychological thriller where Scotty is both the hero and the heel - a real balancing act to pull off and one that needs a beloved actor like Jimmy Stewart in order to be successful. We instantly start liking - and trusting - Scotty from the beginning only to start to lose our trust of him as the events unfold. Stewart's performance is one of the best of his career and holds our attention throughout.Equally captivating is Novak's portrayal of the suicidal wife, Madeleine, who is equal parts beautiful, mysterious and cagey. Without giving too much away, Scotty starts to fall for Madeleine and with Novak's performance, I can see why. She has the trickier part to play in this film and plays the layers of her character well.But this is a Hitchcock film through and through - and shows a top director at the top of his game. From the opening note of Bernard Hermann's off-kilter score to the use of color, place and camera movement, Hitchcock keeps the viewer off-center throughout the film, immersing us in a world that is not quite real, not quite false, which mirrors the reality (or un-reality) that Scotty is dealing with himself.If you have not seen this film, I strongly recommend that you do. If you have not seen this film on the large screen, I doubly strongly encourage you to do so. as it will be theaters on March 18 & 21 as part of Turner Classic Movie's Big Screen Classics film series.Vertigo was recently sited by the BFI Site and Sound poll as the best film of all time, and while I don't quite share that rating of it, I do rate it as ONE of the top films of all time.Letter Grade: A+10 stars (out of 10) and you can take that to the Bank(ofMarquis)"
denscul,"Nov 22, 2000",N/A,"This movie entertains because the director uses the beauty of San Francico, Kim Novak and a good score. The first time I saw this movie, the absurdities were overcome by the above. But after seeing the movie for the third or fourth times, the plot begins to grate on my penchant for logic. I don't mind fantasy, or even science fiction. But, its got to be logical. I find the concept of entering into a murder conspiracy with an accomplice who is as attractive as Kim Novak, and not insist that she move, is simply unblievable. Take it from an old detective, San Francico in the 50's was not big enough to hide a Kim Novak from the eye of a good detective. Then there is the scene at the tower. Its not bad enough that we have to see it once, we see it several times in cartoon color. when you commit a murder, you better think of as many varibles as you can, or you will get caught. Unless you murder some street person and nobody cares. The complex murder scheme makes for great entertainment. But consider this point. How sure could you be that Scotty would leave the scene? Even if he left the tower, the odds are that he would remain in the area. He's a former cop. He's just witnessed a suicide. He can't leave. One of the most absurd scenes is at the inquest, where he is having his character pummeled. Was this the writer's attempt to make Scotty's leaving the scene seem the most logical reaction? Well, it didn't work on me the last time I saw this film."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 23, 2023",10/10,"John 'Scottie' Ferguson is hired by Gavin Elster to trail and report findings on his wife Madeleine. In an unexpected twist Scottie falls for the beautiful, but vulnerable Madeleine.Over the last few years I've worked my way through The Alfred Hitchcock series, and have slowly been working through the films, this one really did hit the spot for me. I was stunned to learn that this wasn't a huge success when it was released, gladly it is now regarded as a classic.Vertigo truly is a great movie, it must rank as one of the great Alfred Hitchcock's finest movies.The film itself feels like two acts, the first is all about Scottie's increasing obsession with Madeleine, the second half sees him dealing with life after the 'accident,' looking for answers, and searching for happiness.The opening sequences instantly grabbed the viewer's attention, and set the tone for the rest of the film. It's full of twists and turns, the best moment however for me was Scottie's nightmare, so trippy, not something I imagine audiences at the time would have been used to.Scottie is an interesting one, he's not the easiest character to like, at times he seems a little possessive, controlling, even coercive, but maybe he has an ulterior motive, you'll have to watch to find out.Production values are terrific, you can see that Hitchcock had a big influence over the tiniest details, the music is phenomenal, especially that opening score.I thought James Stewart was excellent, I bought into his character instantly, I really did get the impression of someone jaded, desperately looking for something after the death of his colleague, maybe love.Novak was equally good as Madeleine, and so much more than just the dazzling beauty, she displayed some true skill.10/10."
tuteken,"Sep 10, 2023",7/10,"A haunting movie with brilliant and beautiful cinematography. I have watched this movie many times, mainly because Kim Novak is so elegantly beautiful in her role. However, I can't get over the beginning where when James Stewart is chasing a perp across the rooftops of San Francisco, he slips and is left dangling precariously from a rain gutter. Subsequently, the police officer backing up Stewart's chase unsuccessfully tries to save him and falls to his death, leaving James hanging. I've always wanted to know how in the hell Stewart got off that roof. There is too much suspension of belief involved. That and the later scenes between Novak and Stewart require the viewer to abandon all logic and fling themself down a Hitchcockian rabbit hole. I've often heard Vertigo has stood the test of time well and is now regarded as one of the greatest films ever. To me, however, it has many great features but continuity and a logical progression are missing and makes me far less generous in my evaluation of what is still a very intriguing bit of cinema."
frog_16,"Aug 11, 2010",10/10,"***SPOILERS BELOW***What I find striking about this film is how it presents such a pessimistic view of romantic love.James Stewart (as Scotty) starts out playing one of his average-guy hero characters, who falls into depression and then into a troubling obsession because of his misplaced romantic love.Most films seem to glorify romance & love. Hitchcock seems to have wanted to point out that though this emotion can be at the center of our lives it is often based upon superficialities.Many films present love as something that is destine to happen between two people. I think that Hitchcock was having fun with this idea, flipping it on its head and twisting it with all sorts of irony...e.g. The person who Scotty fell so deeply in love with did not really exist, she was simply an 'act' (i.e. It's Judy pretending to be Madeleine, who were two very different types of women).Scotty fell completely for the con-job that was Judy pretending to be Madeleine. Then to complicate things Judy in turn also falls in love with him.As part of a murder scheme, Scotty is led to believe 'his' Madeleine has died, in part, due to his negligence. Later when he is wandering the streets of San Francisco he stumbles upon Judy whom he thinks only looks like his lost love. He then strikes up a romantic relationship with her... But Scotty does not appear to be capable of loving Judy for who she really is. e.g. He had become morbidly obsessed with Judy's fake version of Madeleine and he pressures Judy into looking & acting like her (once again), which she does out of love for him.Because of Judy's love for Scotty she decides that her tastes, preferences and even her personality didn't really matter anymore... e.g. Judy gives-in to Scotty's desires and takes on the personality of someone very different from herself.In one sense Scotty is the archetypal romantic hero, who against all odds finds his lost love. But in another sense he is a 'sucker' and someone who has been rendered mentally unstable by his love for a woman who never really existed.Contrast this with Scotty's best friend (Midge), a fairly attractive woman who adores him. Compared to Judy, Midge seems like a woman much more suited to Scotty's tastes. But he is just too romantically fixated on Judy's 'faux' Madeleine for Midge to have a real shot at him.This movie is great for a lot of reasons, many of which have already been mentioned here in other reviews, including: 1.) Novak skillfully playing two very different personalities. 2.) The view it gives us of San Francisco circa the 1950's. 3.) The movie's plot goes through very interesting thematic changes (Starting as a supernatural love story/drama then changing mid-stream into a psychological drama heavily laden with irony.). 4.) It has a wonderful musical score. 5.) And there is a VERY dark ending to the story (Something almost unheard of in American movies prior to the mid-1960's)There are some slight glitches to this film's storyline, None of which I feel are too distracting with the possible exception of the somewhat convoluted wife-murder-scheme, which might seem too far-fetched for some people to accept. But then again, this murder scheme seems just as believable as those portrayed in many of Agatha Christie's famous stories.If I remember correctly Hitchcock said that he felt that such background details were not that important when trying to get an audience immersed into a story. Hey the story works for me! This is one of my favorite movies."
JaneBingley,"Aug 7, 2024",7/10,"""Vertigo"" is often hailed as Hitchcock's magnum opus, a mesmerizing blend of mystery, romance, and psychological complexity. The film stars James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson, a retired detective suffering from acrophobia, who becomes entangled in a labyrinthine plot of obsession and deceit.Kim Novak's dual performance as Madeleine Elster and Judy Barton is both enigmatic and deeply affecting, capturing the essence of Hitchcock's exploration of identity and desire.The film's innovative use of color, dreamlike sequences, and the haunting score by Bernard Herrmann create an almost hypnotic atmosphere that draws viewers into Scottie's increasingly unstable world.""Vertigo"" is a richly layered film that demands multiple viewings to fully appreciate its intricacies and themes. It's a cinematic puzzle that expertly manipulates perspective and expectation, solidifying its place as a good Hitchcock movie."
paul2001sw-1,"Mar 23, 2006",3/10,"Alfred Hitchcock has a reputation as one of the outstanding film-makers of his era; but to a modern viewer, 'Vertigo' disappoints. The plotting is as torturous as any modern thriller, but the 1950 production values continually let it down: one grows tired of out-of-doors scenes transparently shot in the studio (and even the scenes actually shot on location are curiously devoid of passers-by), there's a very clumsy (though admittedly innovative) dream sequence, even the fact that the two leads are unable to even kiss each other properly starts to grate after a while. This might suggest that Hitchcock's only failing with this movie was over-ambition, but unfortunately, it isn't so: for he also fails to get decent performances from his leading actors, stiff-as-a-board Jimmy Stweart and icy Kim Novak (a typical Hitchcock blonde) generate absolutely no on-screen chemistry. And both have complex roles to play: one of them undergoes a kind of nervous breakdown, while the other simulates the same thing; but neither can play their roles with sufficient depth to make this story work as psychological melodrama. There is one interesting female character - played by Barbara Bel Geddes - but she is mysteriously written out half way though for no good reason. Compare the performances in this movie to those being put in by the likes of Marlon Brando or Orson Welles at the same period in time, and one has to pass harsh judgement. There are still a few interesting details: it's amazing how little dialogue Hitchcock dares get away with, and the very bleak ending is surprising for a mainstream film. But it's impossible to invest any emotional feeling in the story; and that's surprising, given Hitchcock's towering legend."
davidlobi1,"Sep 28, 2002",N/A,"I'm not going to be able to say anything about this that hasn't already been said but I recently decided it was my favourite movie of all time.Evidence for claim:It's the only film I've ever watched twice in a row (as in: rewind the tape to the start as soon as the screen fades to back and press PLAY)Vertigo deals with love as obsession - one of the best definitions of Love and one I (worringly) tend to adhere to.That soundtrack. Herrmann's most moving, haunting and disturbing score. I kept replaying the opening credits just to listen to the music. I play it in my head at least every other day.It was underrated in its day by almost everyone - usually the sign of a masterpiece (anything by Kubrick)and too many others qualifying arguments to list.First time viewers might want to be advised about the pacing in the first half - it is purposely slow - but the second time you see it you won't notice because you'll be in the 'dream' that much quicker."
jared-25331,"Oct 14, 2024",10/10,"I just finished watching Vertigo (1958) for the first time ever and this movie is an masterpiece in cinema.Positives for Vertigo (1958):
This movie is one of the most intense, suspenseful and psychological movies I have ever seen in my life. You can tell that Alfred Hitchcock went all out with this movie and I couldn't be any happier about that. It goes without saying that the performances from the entire cast are phenomenal in this movie especially James Stewart as John ""Scottie"" Ferguson and Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine Elster. James Stewart's character of Scottie is one of the most interesting and complex movie protagonists I have ever seen in any movie. Stewart's performance adds so many levels to this character that has me attention throughout the entire runtime. I can say the same for Kim Novak as Judy Barton/Madeleine as she is also very complex and this woman has to play two different characters and she makes both of them stand out in their ways. These two characters and their romance is one of the best onscreen relationships I've seen in any movie and it's even better than some of the relationships in modern movies. There was something about the their relationship and attraction to each other that is so endearing and haunting that you can't help but pay attention to them. And finally, the climax of this movie is so wacky and balls out insane that I couldn't help but applaud Hitchcock for his achievements.Overall, Vertigo (1958) is one of the greatest movies in the history of cinema and it is among my top 3 favorite movies from Alfred Hitchcock's legendary filmography."
JKearse,"Nov 22, 2006",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's greatest work stars James Stewart as a former policeman turn detective in 1950's San Francisco. As is typical with our favorite director, Hitchcock creates his art without cutting back on entertainment, which is why so many consider him motion pictures' greatest film-maker. First time and repeat viewers of Vertigo are compelled to continue viewing Hitchcock's film until the chilling, unexpected end. Vertigo's conclusion is anything but satisfying but rather a life-changing slap in the face. It is probably the greatest film ever made. Stewart and his costar Kim Hunter also give their greatest performances. Barbara Bel Geddes's small supporting performance is equally effective. Hitchcock's incredible eye for landscapes is never more keen as it is in Muir Woods, a California Mission, and around San Francisco. (By the way, the shots of the mission were taken from several missions and assembled together to create a nonexistent mission.)"
hyder_sagg2003,"Jul 24, 2010",9/10,"Previously, I have seen Psycho 10/10 Rear Window 6/10 Rebecca 8/10And Vertigo was different and it was way better than Rear window and I sure liked it. Hitchcock sure was a wonderful director (no problem with rear window's direction) and deserved at least an Oscar but I think Academy has ever been silly. Performance, direction, cinematography and all part of movie were fine enough and the story was told in an interesting Thrilling+Romantic way and The original score of movie was sweet.Inshort, It was a very well made and fine movie but Its not 10/10 good for me. but It sure is very good. You'll like it.8.5/10"

ssssgelojun,"Aug 19, 2020",9/10,"Fear of heights needless to say, I suspect the detective has necrophilia, or a tendency to necrophilia, but the movie is very cryptic... When the detective met the heroine for the second time, although she was attracted, but still asked to dress up as the ""deceased"", she changed into a gray suit when the beginning, the detective finally and her kiss. And both the detective's facial expression and the spatial form (as if it were green or red light) have hints of this strange proclibility."
kevin_robbins,"Aug 29, 2021",10/10,"Vertigo (1958) is currently available on Prime and tells the tale of a former police detective hired to monitor a friend's wife who he claims has been acting strange. She initially appears to be trying to kill herself and the detective saves her several times and eventually falls in love with her. Will love stop her suicide attempts? This movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars James Stewart (Rear Window), Kim Novak (Kiss Me, Stupid), Barbara Bel Geddes (Panic in the Streets) and Tom Helmore (The Time Machine). The storyline for this is very well written by Hitchcock and contains several good twists. Stewart was awesome as the main characters and Novak was solid in her supporting role. There was great chemistry between them. Hitchcock did a great job displaying people's fears and how they are impacted by them. The conclusion is awesome- it gets uncomfortably pushy at times but does a great job of coming full circle. This is a Hitchcock masterpiece that is an absolute must see that I would score an easy 10/10."
TimAdamcik,"Mar 29, 2016",10/10,"Since I started with old films - Chaplin, Hitchcock, Kubrick, I just found something like a second home. Almost all of them have special atmosphere that at least works at me. But Vertigo is different. I didn't expect much of it, but that was the point. You play the film, expect nothing, and it's masterpiece! Alfred kept us during the film in suspense, expectations, and of course many questions. But in the end, Hitchcock answered all of (at least my) questions, and completed my expectations. What's so special about this film? It does make sense, it makes you ask yourself questions or create combinations why this happened, and so on. Definitely worth watching, even because of it's length - 2 hours 8 minutes 26 seconds. Since I saw this film, Alfred Hitchcock is my favorite director, and I can't wait watching his masterpieces."
cartesianthought,"May 24, 2016",9/10,"From the beginning, I was allured into it. The plot of this movie is more supernatural and magical than some of his others. It's largely a mystery and psychological thriller, but it has elements of numerous genres as well.It's full of different plot twists, and while some things one can figure out well in advance, others completely took me off guard. Almost every moment gave me a feeling of apprehension and excitement. Everything in the film feels uncanny and too good to be true, yet so convincingly done. The evolution of the protagonist from a do-gooder, to a heartbroken lover to a total wreck is done swiftly though impactfully.I love Hitchcock. There's a certain feeling you get when you watch a movie that's more than just a movie. It's something special."
DeadeGuard98,"May 30, 2020",10/10,"😱 First Impressions:
The first ever work I saw of Alfred Hitchcock was Psycho- revolutionary as a slasher but I grew hungrier for more his thriller masterpieces. Then I saw Dial M for Murder and finally Vertigo. Though I had my doubts initially, this has arguably become one of my absolute favorites by the legend.Pros:
😋 The ensemble cast. It goes without saying of course that the director knows how to pick them! But I must absolutely commend the range of protagonists Scottie and Madeliene/Judy who essentially play two different characters each or rather the impression that they are.😋 The first time watching it (even sometimes when rewatching it), I could not foresee the shocker of an ending. The over-the-top albeit ingenious of a murder scheme is absolutely entertaining and I can only blame myself for falling in love with the characters... getting too attached.😋 The cinematography is beautiful; throughout it's runtime there comes the occasionally rare moment portraying a ephemeral quality; much akin to that of a ghost's or the otherwordliness (in keeping with the theme after all). It stays with you. Even the act of describing and then later on showing the dream sequences are terrifying.Cons:
😪 There was that one part in the film where I thought the reveal was rather quick and sudden- we had just gotten to know Kim Novak's second character, Judy. I mean obviously they are played by the one and only actress but there could have been a much longer psychological game to play juggling between the two women. Is it just a striking resemblance? Doesn't it say more about the character of Scottie, seemingly unable to move on after changing Judy's appearance only to find out it was all worthless.😪 Midge's character never saw an ending or resolution. At least with Madeleine's husband, it's explained that he has left after having perfectly executed the deed with his late wife. I thought she was phenomenal! Pining after Scottie, she was the only one there to help him after his mental breakdown. It's not really a vexing issue but one I just felt sorry for- perhaps that was the goal.😇Verdict😈
One of the most iconic thrillers that played with audience's expectation start to finish. Usually I am quite good at guessing how the endings would go to slashers, thrillers or even horror movies in general. But when it comes to Alfred Hitchcock's portfolio, I always seem to miss the mark. The endings always endure in the back of your mind long after the viewing and that's something we have yet to see in a modern thriller."
SanTropez_Couch,"Apr 11, 2003",7/10,"The greatness of this film eludes me. It's certainly a good film, and I liked it, but whatever element this film has that makes it any better than the rest of Hitchcock's movies remains unseen by me. To be honest, the only idea that makes me value it any more than a standard Hitchcock thriller is its honesty -- that Jimmy Stewart's controlling nature over Kim Novak parallels Hitchcock's own controlling nature over his actresses.The most thrilling moment of the entire film, for me, was the opening credits, with those classic spirals and the first hint of Bernard Herrmann's great score.The story is simple: a cop (Jimmy Stewart), after watching one of his buddies fall to his death, contracts vertigo and acrophobia and leaves the force. Then, one day, when an old school friend calls him to keep an eye on his wife (Kim Novak) who's been acting strangely, believing she's someone else, he gets involved once more. Stewart falls in love with Novak, whom he saves from drowning in the San Francisco Bay, but her aloof nature and apparent psychological damage prevents her from returning the love.Then something happens that would be criminal to give away.I just don't see what makes this movie great, or stand out among Hitchcock's other work. Is it really because it's so personal? Maybe there's something I'm missing, maybe there are subtleties placed throughout the film that I didn't get and that I've completely misunderstood the point of the movie. As far as I can see, though, the film's ""complex"" message is that love is either one big trick or a perverted obsession. (Either that, or I'm forced to venture desperately into dream territory: ""Oh, you know, everything after so-and-so was a dream, and that, therefore, makes the movie real complex."")I admire the film's craft, and I didn't find it boring or anything, but I was expecting something very complex, much more than this. I also felt for the heartbroken Stewart, as well as the Midge character, his admirer. I could also sympathize with Novak's character, as she's manipulated by Stewart.Aside from the opening credits, which I adore, my favorite part of the movie may well be the restaurant where we first see Novak. That incredibly red room must have influenced Peter Greenaway when he made ""The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, and Her Lover."" There are also a few camera moves that are nice, and thanks to the terrific transfer, the colors, images, and sounds (which are essential to the film's appeal) are impeccable.While I want to understand what it is people feel that makes them call this movie great, and I'll see it again sometime, I'm not going to re-watch it just so I can ""get"" it. I'm generally not a fan of re-watching movies to discover their greatness -- I find most people who do that are, in effect, lying to themselves the second time, convinced that they ""get"" it. I hate to be part of the dissent, especially when favorites of mine like ""Fargo"" have an equally enthusiastic following that denounces them as completely unexceptional. But as it stands, this movie is just a well-crafted, more-personal-than-usual thriller.***"
aradford57,"Feb 18, 2022",10/10,"Stewart & Novak should have been very proud of their performances in this edgy, psychological, murder thriller. It's a shame that on release in 1957/8 it received lukewarm reviews. It took Truffaut in the 1970s to elevate it to cult status.Stewart a retired police detective, falls for the beautiful & charismatic Novak, whilst investigating her erratic behaviour, on the request of her worried husband. But not all is as it appears.Many complain that it's too long but it's a film to savour and immerse oneself in.And really should be viewed multiple times.Still a triumph 64 years after it was released, as are most of Hitcocks films.Special mention should go to the beautiful photography and wonderful musical score by Hermann.WATCH IT."
jakub-wiszniewski,"Jul 6, 2014",1/10,"Well, this movie was a nightmare to me. I actually liked first 30 minutes. But that's it, i might not be fan of old movies, but i seen better that i enjoyed a little. This one was just boring. And not any kind you mostly meet, it was one most BORING things i ever watched. If i could choose between watching this and doing almost anything else, i think you know the answer. Anyway, this movie was just too long. It could have ended in first hour. Just roll the credits. And even if not in one hour... It should have taken much less time then it did, mostly because you saw how it will end 45 minutes before it happened. At least it had interesting start."
aylaykchikin,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"Vertigo is a masterpiece of suspense and intrigue that truly stands the test of time! Hitchcock's direction is brilliant, weaving a gripping atmosphere that keeps you guessing at every turn. The cinematography is stunning, capturing San Francisco like never before, and the iconic score perfectly amplifies the tension. The performances are exceptional, with complex characters and twists that will leave you thinking long after the credits roll. The way the story unfolds is mesmerizing, redefining psychological thrillers and cementing its place as a must-see classic. It's an unforgettable journey into obsession, identity, and the mysteries of the human mind!"
bnm81510,"Apr 20, 1999",10/10,"As mesmerizing as it is long and difficult to comprehend, ""Vertigo"" is one of cinema's strangest tales of romantic obsession, the kind that certainly would not be made nowadays, since the subject is increasingly demonized in the American culture. Surprisingly enough, it works, in large part through the director's mastery over the medium. Some speculate that it was a highly personal project for him, a casting out of his own internal struggles. Such theories validity is questionable, but anyone watching will notice the movie's much lesser degree of calculating, joyful logic that almost all other Hitchcock's works are saturated with. Incredibly true to its title, by virtue of an eerie score and some dizzying cinematography, the movie induces the sense of romantic vertigo in the audience. A fantastic opening credits sequence which resembles digital animation, suggests a visionary quality that refused to be confined to its time period."
guskeller,"Oct 14, 2021",10/10,"Vertigo is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best films and one of the greatest movies of all time. Its most noticeable strength is the use of vibrant color, which Vertigo wields to convey themes of lust, death, and guilt. The cinematography continues with complex arc shots and dolly zooms that are utilized throughout. Meanwhile, more subtle framing compositions are consistently setting up mysterious tones and motifs surrounding obsession. However, Vertigo is far more than just its visuals.Vertigo is also masterfully written. The story starts as a simple thriller but develops thoughtful purpose. Opposing forces like fear/attraction, passion/death, repetition/distortion are explored in concise yet elusive ways. The music ties this together with ethereal yet uneasy melodies, fitting perfectly because it nails the sensation of disoriented freefall (both physically and mentally). Additionally, the special effects evoke a surreal atmosphere. Matte paintings and rear projections give this intimate story a grander feel. Throw in a trippy dream sequence that is a flavorful departure from the film's meticulous pace, and we have a wholly impactful experience. All told, it is clear why Vertigo is considered a masterpiece and still influential today.Writing: 10/10

daviddaphneredding,"May 28, 2016",10/10,"This is one of my favorite Hitchcock films, the other two being North by Northwest and the comical The Trouble with Harry. The setting of San Francisco was, in my personal opinion, a big drawing card. To be sure, Hitchcock knew well how to weave together suspense, romance, and mystery. James Stewart and Kim Novak clicked well together in this masterpiece by the master of suspense. And, Kim Novak was quite talented at playing two roles in this movie. Stewart was also adept at playing two types of people, a kind, good natured man, but also a hostile, temperamental man in places. You wanted to hate Tom Elmore. It was structured so very well also; it was almost like two dramas in one. Bernard Herrmann, an excellent musician, definitely and effectively provided the needed eeriness for the film. And, the color was beautiful. Because of the eeriness of the film, the excellent acting, the, again, very beautiful setting of San Francisco, as well as the suspenseful story, again, this ranks among one of my favorite all-time movies."
donovan-cadman,"Mar 20, 2013",N/A,"This was a thought that streamed through my head, what's going to happen next? Which kept me in tuned and drawn to my seat, with no attention of leaving until it was over. It was like most Hitchcock films,had an oddness to it which made it a unique masterpiece. This is one of those films that inspire directors, such as Martin Scorsese. If you watch a film more than once and get new information out of it every time, thats what I would consider a great movie. Also great actors to play these parts and a contribute in this classic, made this film that much better. Hithcock couldn't have gone wrong with the actors who played these amazing characters. A great film I would say the least."
sejal-mrs,"Aug 1, 2014",9/10,"Hitchcock's powerful and stunning portrayal of a twisted man's psyche is chilling yet hits a chord among the common human thread of identity, longing and self-destruction. The movie's themes transcend time to apply universally to the human experience even today.I would recommend it watching it when your ready to dissect a masterpiece and re-watch just to capture it's brilliance. This is a classic that I wouldn't want to miss. It shows you the depth and layers of the human experience that only an outstanding movie like Vertigo can bring about. Play special attention to the opening sequence and make sure you don't miss a word."
ken_bethell,"Aug 7, 2012",6/10,"It was after I heard that Vertigo had replaced Citizen Kane as 'Best Movie of all Time' that I pondered as to whether I had actually seen this film. This was curious as I had no difficulty in remembering 'Kane' despite having only seen it once some 35 years ago. Since I could not recall missing any other James Stewart picture of that era or any of the other big productions of 1950s I assumed that I had seen it but would view it again. I watched it last night and my instincts were correct. I had forgotten this film because it is forgettable! In fact the only memorable thing about the film was the San Francisco skyline which had become beautifully enhanced by its conversion to BluRay. I have never been a great Hitchcock fan for the very reason that his films tend to be over-stylised and Vertigo is no exception. No great acting accolades either in fact dialogue seem to be a secondary consideration to the visual enactment of Stewart's character's mental decline. The film could easily have been a silent film. One critic commented on being fascinated by the complexity of this multi-layered psycho-drama. Uhmm, really. The ending was pure David Lynch - not difficult to see where he got his inspiration, but it was inadequate for a movie lasting beyond two hours. For lovers of this movie genre I would recommend 'The Woman in the Fifth'. Don't be put off by its low rating in IMDb. It is fine example Pawel Pawlilowski's direction and Ethan Hawke is excellent as the mentally-bewildered American adrift in Paris. Back to Vertigo and what more can I say? This film and others of its period have garnered praise well beyond their station by virtue of the current nostalgia boom. My criterion for deciding how good a film is is whether or not it stands the test of time - does it look dated? This film does, as does 'From Here to Eternity' but 'On the Waterfront' doesn't.It's purely personal of course."
Mr-Fusion,"Mar 21, 2023",5/10,"""Obsessed"" is more like it, the way Jimmy Stewart fixates on Kim Novak. The fear of heights aspect of the film almost seems like an afterthought in comparison.I've gotta be honest, ""Vertigo"" did not agree with me. The first act is tedious; the performances are overly dramatic; and the ending feels like slamming into a brick wall: way too abrupt. What really strikes me odd is that the most interesting person here is Barbara Bel Geddes, and she's as ancillary as they get.The film's sterling reputation isn't lost on me; it's a stone classic and near critic-proof. It wouldn't surprise me if either age or future rewatch will help the movie ""click"" for me; but in the here-and-now, it's nowhere near Hitchcock's best."
marzaljim,"Sep 19, 2006",10/10,"I must say that if you have a chance to see it at the theater, you absolutely must! All of the street scenes in and around Sam Francisco come to life, details that you miss on your home screen. The colors and images are so detailed and vivid it mesmerizes. It's especially delicious if you've ever been to San Francisco and San Juan Batista. The scene at Ernie's gives you an appreciation of fine dining in another era. All the men are in formal or semi-formal dress and the ladies in elegant evening gowns. The super-imposed scenes are also more evident, such as the scene at the lone cypress on the coast, show how Hitchcock wanted perfection in a scene, even when he has a perfect location."
Jessie-Anderson,"Feb 26, 2021",10/10,There's not much to say about Vertigo other than it's a masterpiece! Intriguing and visually appealing. Hitchcock style at it's best- he never disappoints! The rhythm of the film carries you from the beginning to the end and it doesn't let go.
