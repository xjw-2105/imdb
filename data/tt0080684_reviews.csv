Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 18, 2023",10/10,"Luke Skywalker goes in search of Jedi Master Yoda, to begin his Jedi training, meanwhile his friends and fellow band of rebels are pursued by The Empire's forces.How on Earth was it possible to match, if not surpass Episode IV, it seems unfathomable, well that's exactly what they did with this remarkable movie, and whilst I personally rank the films on par with one another, I get why some favour this one. For me, the first came out of nowhere, whereas for this second one, expectations would have been incredibly high.A superb storyline, breathtaking visuals, first class acting, and Yoda, what more could anyone possibly want or need from a movie, it's a bold claim, but I would genuinely say this is one of the greatest films of all time.The sets are unbelievable, you can really tell that for those involved this was definitely a labour of love, everything was precise and on point.It's worth a 10/10 for Yoda alone, I adore his and Luke's scenes together. The wonderful voice of Frank Oz adds a great deal, it really does help to make Yoda such an amazing, funny, smart and curious character.Let's be honest, films don't get much better than this, it really is a masterpiece.10/10."
saveliydalmatov,"Dec 30, 2023",10/10,"So, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is a sequel to the previous part. After the release of the first episode, the budget, the fans appeared, and, accordingly, the quality improved!The fifth episode is the darkest and even the best in the original trilogy (in my personal opinion), and for many in the entire franchise.Here we will hear the famous Imperial March for the first time, learn all the greatness of the Empire under the leadership of Vader, as well as the formation of Luke as a Jedi.New characters have added color to the franchise, some have already become iconic and famous among many (the same Boba Fett).This fascinating story will feature plot twists (for sure many people understood what I was talking about) and a very addictive atmosphere of horror.As a result, this is what the fans needed - a successful sequel. And, of course, you need to look at it, it's a classic after all.My Rating : 10/10 (one of the best films)"
UniqueParticle,"Jan 16, 2020",10/10,"So much amazing action and beautiful cinematography makes for such an enlightening experience! In The Empire Strikes Back you know who everyone is which is great plus Yoda is introduced! I love this movie the music is soothing, there's romance, more of Darth Vader, and introduces Emperor Palpatine what more can you ask for? A lot to relish and get excited about; it's such a classic gem."
ivo-cobra8,"Apr 25, 2016",10/10,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is an excellent timeless classic that it is the best sequel of all time. I love this film to death, it is my second favorite film and the best sequel in the Star Wars franchise that I love. The Empire Strikes Back is a movie that it is one of the best sequels I can think of, it is right there with Aliens (1986), it is right there with Terminator 2: Judgment Day (1991) it is an excellent sequel and it really does establish The Empire as a value treat. Empire Strikes Back is still and excellent film which I really believe is a timeless classic. This is my second favorite film from director Irvin Kershner. Number 1 favorite Irvin Kershner film will be RoboCop 2 (1990) which is very underrated action flick. I still have to review those movies someday.Empire Strikes Back (1980) is the best one of the series, because it's deeper, darker, more philosophical. It's great because Darth Vader and the Empire are at their most menacing, the direction is creative, the characters feel real, the nature of the Force is explored more without losing its mysticism, and the pacing is, as George Lucas would put it, faster and more intense than any other film in the saga.The plot is actually more a rescue mission that Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) is coming to rescue his friends Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca are captured on a planet Bespin in Cloud City from villainous Darth Vader. Han Solo's friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) set the up and with Darth Vader he set a trap for Luke. Also Luke studied the Force under Jedi Master Yoda to become a full Jedi Knight but in the end he must confront Darth Vader (David Prowse) by him self. The origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled.Empire Strikes Back was released in 1980 it is directed by Irvin Kershner this time and not George Lucas. Because George Lucas decide that he want to make this sequel independent one, so he ended up coming with his own, founding for the film. Getting a loan and money he earn from the first movie and it success, so he decided he wanted, to found the film him self, and he wanted to be more an executive producer to keep an eye on the lamp, he moved to a bigger studio in Orange County, California, so he diced to be more a producer he did not want to direct Empire Strikes Back. So his first choice was Irvin Kershner, who was a professor at UC in the UC film school, that George attended too and he always liked Irvin Kershner and of course he was a former professor and it was a hard way talk him to do it and the first time Irvin Kershner didn't want to do it, so George called Irvin's agent and his agent said to Irvin take it so he did and the rest is a history. This stands the test of time, the best film he ever directed! I love John Williams score still the same, but I think John Williams changed the music score for a little bit, but that's just my opinion.Things that I love in this film: I love the battle with Rebels fighting with the Imperial AT-AT walkers on the ice world of Hoth. That is my favorite scene on ice world in the film. The Imperial AT-AT walkers are incredible well made with classic special effects.I love that the origins of Luke Skywalker are reveled, that Luke is the son of Darth Vader, who is actually Anakin Skywalker, before he become Darth Vader and went to the dark site.For the first time ever, we see an Emperor in a Hologram talking to Darth Vader.The Falcon with Han Solo, Princess Leia Organa, C-3PO and Chewbacca hiding in the rocks try's to eat a monster.Luke faces with Darth Vader him self face to face and get his arm cut off and then he jumps off the bridge, because he didn't want to join his father in a dark force. The lightsaber duel throughout the chamber between Luke and Darth Vader was excellent and it was epic.The training sequence with Luke and master Yoda were excellent and epic.A New Hope and The Empire Strikes Back are my favorite films in series, that are in the franchise, this film get's a perfect 10 score for been the best sci-fi adventure sequel of all time."
Dissident,"May 2, 2000",N/A,"The Empire Strikes Back is the best film in the original Star Wars trilogy. It has all the great qualities that the original Star Wars has: great effects (at the time of its release), appealing characters, and lots of spellbinding action.  It also has eliminated some of the problems that plagued the first: the storyline is tighter, and goes much deeper into character development.  The performances are terrific, especially by Harrison Ford as Han Solo, and Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian. George Lucas has also remembered to include a spellbinding battle sequence with the snowspeeder sequence near the beginning of the film.  The conclusion, with a lightsaber duel between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker, is truly one of the most suspenseful and dramatic scenes in the entire series.  This is a truly wondrous film, and serves as a constant reminder that just because a movie is expensive and a blockbuster doesn't mean that it has to be shallow and two dimensional.  This film will undoubtedly entertain viewers of all ages from start to finish."
morfunkel,"Aug 21, 2018",10/10,"This film changed the game forever. The people behind the scenes took an exciting science fiction adventure film with a happy tone where the heroes have a happy tone throughout and throwing that on its side. Throughout the film the rebels are in a constant rush and panic, pushing the viewers to the edge of their seat wondering if the heroes would make it to the end okay. This is done brilliantly by splitting up the heroes putting them in a worried state for one another. As well as that the rebels are all tested as they go through their own personal trails and try to find their way through.
Even though this might put you on a constant worry for the characters the movie is paced perfectly with breathers and amazing storytelling by the characters to fill in anything we need answers for.
That is just the story, the film also has gorgeous cinematography, going from the AT-ATs on Hoth, to the Imperial pursuit of the Falcon through the asteroid field, all the way down to the beautiful shots of the final battle in Cloud city. Even though we as viewers are worried for the rebels, the imagery is jaw dropping. 
The imagery is further enhanced by the most popular score of all time, John Williams delivers his best work ever as it has stuck with people their entire lives and is recognizable by even those who haven't seen the film. 
The film was released in 1980 and all of the set design and special effects still hold up to this day as they are just as convincing now as it was apon first watch for everyone in the past 38 years."
SnoopyStyle,"May 6, 2016",10/10,"After the destruction of the Death Star, the Rebel Alliance has been hounded by the Empire. Princess Leia, Luke Skywalker, and Han Solo are with the Rebel forces on the secret base on the planet Hoth. Darth Vader locates the base driving the rebels on the run. Leia, Chewie, and Han with C-3PO escape on the Millennium Falcon eventually ending up in Lando Calrissian's Cloud City. Meanwhile, Luke goes to the Dagobah system and finds Jedi Master Yoda.There are superior popcorn movies in the Star Wars franchise although there is plenty of eye-popping action in this one. This is the best overall film in the series. The dialog is snappier. The combative romance between Leia and Han is the best. Everything looks great. It introduces Yoda and Lando. There are great legendary twists. It is a Star Wars movie for film fans. Even the Special Edition is the best of the original trio. There may be one or two stiff additions but most of them actually help. There are so many incredible moments in this."
Dagobah_Man,"Nov 20, 2007",10/10,"I cannot believe some people out there didn't like this film, yet claim to have enjoyed Episode One. No comparison whatsoever. ""The Empire Strike Back"" is George Lucas' best contribution to human history, and it will be remembered long after most other science fiction films have gone the way of the Do-Do Bird. The optical effects still stand the test of time, and the acting is superb. Harrison Ford, Mark Hamil and Carrie Fisher are all better than they we in the original Star Wars, having fully developed and grown into their characters, and the story just keeps going and going, from asteroid fields to swamp planets to cities in the sky, everything in this film works. So ignore anyone who claims to dislike it, and see it for yourself if you haven't already done so. 20 out of 10!!Oh, and Han Solo shot first! =)"
Spleen,"Oct 26, 1999",10/10,"`It avoids having the standard shoot-'em-up ending,' says a friend of mine, `by not having an ending.'  I suppose this is what most people think, but all the same the film manages to form a satisfying whole; or at least, a whole that satisfies me.  I'm therefore inclined to think it DOES have an ending.  Obviously, I can't discuss this without giving things away to those few who don't know what happens.  If you're one of those few, then believe me: your ignorance is precious enough to be worth guarding until you see the film.  Stop reading now.After the surprise attack on the rebel base, Luke Skywalker splits with Han, Leia, et al.  Han's party gets away first (is it just me, or is the shot of Luke watching the Falcon flying off while he stands stranded on the ground, a poignant one?), but thereafter they face one narrow escape after another, while Luke slinks off quietly and safely to train with Yoda.The training scenes are many and Yoda talks a great deal of rubbish.  But somehow it doesn't matter.  The film is ambivalent in its attitude towards Yoda, anyway.  Our sympathy clearly lies with the entirely non-spiritual concerns of Han, Leia and the adolescent Luke.  The main story concerns the understanding that builds between Han and Leia.  In the end they are honest with one another; and if Han's being frozen and shipped back to Tatooine is the price to pay for this, well, it's the price to pay.  It was very important NOT to end with the dashing rescue that opens `Return of the Jedi', which would be dramatically beside the point.  Instead we end with the promise that the rescue will some day occur.  That's enough.As for Luke: he abandons Yoda to rescue Han and Leia, and achieves NOTHING WHATEVER.  This was my favourite touch.  All five Jedis - Luke, Obi-Wan, Yoda, Vader, and the Emperor - find that their conflicting instincts are all entirely wrong.  The film is really about the temporary triumph of human impulses over the mystical Force.  Luke's human idealism is vindicated, but his supernatural powers, just this once, are not.When George Lucas gave his Star Wars trilogy a fresh coat of varnish in 1997 he felt he had to justify the expense by making needless changes.  You'll notice he made precious few changes to episode V.  There just wasn't room. He added a few extra shots of the ice monster, which of course weakened that one scene; but even with those changes in place the Special Edition is virtually identical to the original edition.  Since Lucas was so keen on making changes wherever he could this is obviously a tribute to the tightness of the story and the direction.  It's also a tribute to the perfection of the original special effects, more innovative than the effects in the first Star Wars movie and better than the effects in any subsequent one."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Aug 6, 2002",10/10,"In a film like The Empire Strikes Back, especially a few years on the heels of such a mind-bogglingly great film like the original Star Wars, there is something that comes immediately to mind that would at first seem to count against the film, but instead only winds up increasing the respect that it commands. In the 1977 Star Wars, there is a clear reliance on simplicity in some parts. Obviously, it is much more than a simply made science fiction film, but like I said in my review of it, there was a lot of highly effective reliance on things that were not put on screen, such as Obi Wan's description of The Force to Luke. In The Empire Strike Back, the first thing that we are treated to is the traditional scrolling text along a background of stars, depicting what has happened between the last film and this one, and reminding us of the things that were mentioned in the last film but never explained.At first, this would almost seem to be a way to save money to get more information across to the audience without having to actually put it on screen, but this is really an ingenious way of furthering the story. The very fact that we are so willing to read all this information and forgive our inability to actually see it is a testament to the quality of the series, even at this early stage in its presentation, and we know the story so well from the first film that we are glad to see such a large change in what's happening in the films, not for a second lamenting the fact that we have obviously missed so much action. And besides that, if and when George Lucas runs out of new prequels to release, and maybe if he someday begins to run low on how many hundreds of millions of dollars he has, he could go right back and make these in-between scenes into full length films. What would he call these, if he did that? Introquels? Who cares! The names themselves would be interesting enough, and if you go back and read the stuff that introduces this film, it's obvious that there's an entire film there just waiting to be made. I guess the question of actors would be a formidable one, though.The Empire Strikes Back is the film where we are first introduced to the great Jedi master Yoda (`Away put your weapon!'), as well as some of the most thrilling battle sequences of the entire Star Wars series, and that includes the prequels. The battle scene where the rebels fight the Imperial Walkers on the ice planet is an incredibly well-made battle scene, not only in the way that it was put together so convincingly using models, but that the machines themselves are so creatively made. Indeed, the Imperial Walkers are some of the most recognizable machines from the entire Star Wars saga, right up there with the Millennium Falcon and the Death Star.I have just watched this film again, having already seen Episode I and Episode II, and not having seen any of the original Star Wars films for maybe 10 years (except for the original 1977 Star Wars, which I saw and reviewed a few days ago - and these aren't even the Special Edition versions!). When I first saw Yoda when watching The Empire Strikes Back again, I was really struck by how different he looked from in the newer movies. Obviously, he's completely computer generated in the new films, but here in Episode V he looks like a muppet! Even so, I would like to express my opinion that Yoda is more realistic and more interesting here as a puppet than in the newer films as a computer generated image. At least here in the older films you know that he's actually THERE, and that he's not just added into the film later.Oh yeah, speaking of Yoda, can I just complain for a minute? What the hell was up with the Jedi training? Yes, I realize that I'm just a lowly IMDb reviewer, while The Empire Strikes Back is a part of the greatest science fiction series of all time, but would it have killed George Lucas to write in a little more creative training for Luke? The thing that struck me first about the Star Wars films when I first started watching them was how incredibly imaginative they were, but then Luke started his training. You know, when I was in high school I played football. I was a wide receiver/tight end and I hardly ever got to play because I was too tall and too skinny, but part of my workout was to carry the linemen up and down the stairs to the weight room. Some of these guys weighed 100 pounds more than me, and I still almost never saw the field, and here's Luke Skywalker. He carries Yoda around this boggy swamp and he gets to be a Jedi! What the hell!There is also the addition of a surprisingly fitting love story. First of all, anyone who has ever read my review of a Jerry Bruckheimer movie will know that I am not the biggest fan of cramming a love story into a movie where it doesn't belong. I can't seem to write anything about Bruckheimer movies without complaining about the idiot love story, and now it's even worse because here's this movie that was made so long before, from which Bruckheimer could obviously have at least learned a LITTLE bit about how to do it right. Han Solo and Princess Leia maintain the personalities that they developed in the first Star Wars film and there is now a sort of love/hate relationship between the two of them, where neither one of them wants to admit their feelings for the other. This romantic subplot is characterized perfectly in the scene just before Solo is carbon frozen, when Leia risks approaching a cheesy romantic moment by saying `I love you' just before Han is lowered into the freezing chamber, and he saves the moment by responding, `I know.' Han Solo. Smart-ass to the last drop.Before I end I would like to point out that the goofs that can be found on the IMDb for this film are some of the most blatant that I've ever seen in a film. The scene where you can see someone giving a woman at the tactical maps a cue to deliver her lines is amazingly obvious, and some of the other ones, such as the stage hand swinging the light saber prop briefly into view as he switches it for an `off' prop with Luke just after he knocks Darth Vader over backwards, are just as much fun to look for. I have one question about the goofs, though. There's one where Luke looks off into the fog just after R2-D2 is eaten by the sea monster, and you can CLEARLY see a person running to the right a little ways off in the fog. Is that meant to be Luke? It seems that it's supposed to be him running in his search for R2, because you can even hear the FOOTSTEPS of the person running. I can't even IMAGINE how they could have missed THAT!!It is, however, a testament to the quality of a film when such tremendous oversights in editing do nothing to take away from the overall quality of the film. The Empire Strikes Back remains an extremely powerful and well-made installment in the Star Wars series, not taking even a single step backwards in the sheer breathtaking adventure of the original film. It's not often that a film as good as Star Wars can be released and then followed up with a sequel that is just as great, as is clearly the case here. Star Wars was a gigantic film upon its release, and with The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas has begun the formation of one of the greatest film series' in cinematic history."
ethanwissmann,"May 28, 2022",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back brings the viewer further into the galaxy of Star Wars. Following the events of Episode IV: A New Hope, this darker chapter brings newer characters and adventures to the table. We learn more about who we have already come to love in the previous installment and we are able to enjoy a much more well-rounded and fleshed out idea of what Lucas' galaxy far far away should look and feel like. Harrison Ford's portrayal of Han Solo steals the show alongside his companion Chewbacca, played by the late Peter Mayhew. Mark Hamill really ups his game with Luke, making him into a less adolescent and sheltered farm kid, he's learning more about his past and the life he never knew. Carrie Fisher as Leia Organa is the perfect mixture of sass and whit as she shows us that not all space royalty is uppity and useless. Billy Dee Williams knocks it out of the park with his performance as the suave and charismatic Lando Calrissian. With the success of A New Hope, this movie boasts and impressive budget increase. This is shown in the care and detail taken into consideration when seeing all of the creatures and vehicles shown throughout the film. Simply put, this movie CARES. The people involved put forth their best work to bring what the world needed in a constant rotation of mundane and bad sci-fi action flicks coming out around the same time. The Empire Strikes Back is a perfect Star Wars movie in an otherwise very flawed saga. I recommend it for anyone that wants to go on a wild and fun ride through the stars!"
Ithaqua1987,"Dec 17, 2004",9/10,"An excellent sequel to Star Wars, this is easily the darkest and most serious out of all the Star Wars films, at least until Revenge of the Sith comes out. This movie benefits from the introduction of Yoda, a diminutive yet wise Jedi master who helps Luke prepare for his showdown with Darth Vader. It also introduces Lando Calrissian, Han's old gambling and smuggling buddy played very well by Billy Dee Williams. Empire is more character driven than the original and relies more on comic relief to help lighten the mood, but it doesn't go overboard with the humor. The story is more refined and the acting is better as well. Despite all of this I can't really say that I enjoyed Empire more than the original. The original Star Wars has a certain charm to it that none of the sequels (or prequels) have captured. I'd say that it is at least on par with the original though and is a fitting follow up in what is probably the greatest series of movies in the history of cinema."
tylerkom,"Sep 13, 2020",6/10,"This film as well as A New Hope has put me in a very very strange predicament. How exactly does one evaluate a film in which one knows the entire plot a priori, to no fault of the film. As well as a film with astounding visuals at the time, but very poorly aged visuals and shot selection today. Such is my problem with star wars as a franchise. So considering the circumstances, let me shortly say the following.Star Wars is an excellent intellectual property based on an excessively cheesy movie franchise. I feel similarly to the star wars franchise as I do the Marvel cinematic universe. They are a set of fun and entertaining family movies that can make your imagination go absolutely wild. I know I'm not alone in pretending that I was a Jedi or a Superhero when I was young. What the franchise is not is any sort of art film or strong statement about anything. It is pure fun, but perhaps better left in nostalgia than a film to come back to. As the weight of the visual technology fades, it is hard for me to justify that the average storytelling and wonderful soundtrack are enough to carry it.Conclusion: wonderful IP and universe, very cheesy film."
TheMusicDewd22,"May 1, 2018",5/10,"Seriously. The Robot Chicken specials are much more entertaining to watch than this ""Star Wars"" film.I just watched this film all the way through not to long ago and I was shocked at how boring and forgettable this episode was. I can't believe people still really think this film represents Star Wars at it's peak when The Phantom Menace exists. The only truly classic thing to come out of this film is The Imperial March is an iconic score and deserves all the praise it gets. But other than that? There is isn't anything that I can truly call great in this film.I'm sure this film was amazing for it's time and me not even being alive in 1980 is probably one of the biggest reasons why I don't understand the so called ""pure genius"" of this film, but there is no doubt in my mind that it has greatly suffered the Seinfeld effect and is something you had to actually be around for understand what all the hype is about for this so called ""excellent"" and ""amazing"" sequel."
bob the moo,"Jun 27, 2002",N/A,"The Rebellion has struck an important blow to the power of the Empire by destroying it's Death Star, however the power of the Dark Side of the Force remains strong and continues to hunt the rebellion.  While the Rebellion base on Hoth is under treat, Luke has gone to a distant swamp planet to receive further Jedi training from Master Yoda.  However the power of the dark side should not be underestimated and many dark truths are revealed as the threat of the Empire looms large.Following Star Wars was never going to be easy but this is actually better. Empire retains the same characters and the same sense of fun that the first had  the battle on Hoth is just one of THE moments of the series.  However what gets added to that is a much darker strand.  The Empire is not beaten by the destruction of one ship  it's power is barely dented in fact.  This sees some startling revelations (I won't spoil it in case you've been living under a rock!) but also sees significant blows to the rebellion.  In fact the ending of this film could not be more different from the end of Star Wars.Like the recent episode two this follows two strands  the more pedestrian scenes with Luke and Yoda and the more action based scenes with Han and company.  The scenes with Yoda add depth to the film and hint at the truth. Meanwhile the other half is a lot more action orientated and has comedy and good new characters such as Bobba Fett.  The two work well together and come together well for a great finale.  The addition of a dark strand to the film makes it all the better as it can be enjoyed as a story and not just a fun sci-fi film with good effects.The characters are better here than the first.  The strong characters from the first (Han, C3P0 et al) are all still good here.  However we also get a much more interesting version of Luke as he continues his journey into becoming a full Jedi.  Yoda is a good addition (despite sounding like Fozzie Bear!) and Darth Vader becomes a lot more than just a good villain  we learn his past, a revelation then, but a thing of common knowledge now.Overall this is as good as Star Wars at it's heart, but the darker nature of the film makes it much better.  Where the first one was a victorious uprising this is, as the title suggests, the time in history where the Empire strikes back against the uprising.  All the music, characters and things that make Star Wars Star Wars are here and it's simply one of the best of the series to date."
tunesplitter,"Jul 3, 2020",10/10,A true masterpiece. in my opinion the best star wars movie.
Xstal,"Apr 4, 2023",8/10,"Yavin 4 had been discovered so they fled, three years later and it's Hoth where rebels tread, Luke Skywalker's on patrol, when a Wampa takes control, leaves him hanging in its cave to have with bread.

A droid informs the Empire what it's found, leaves the rebels little time to hang around, first protect the energy field, that provides the bases shield, as off to Hoth, Imperial forces bound.It's a game of cat and mouse, as the rebels seek to avoid capture and Luke develops his Jedi skills while learning some pertinent family history but becomes a little less dexterous (for the time being)."
TheLittleSongbird,"Nov 29, 2009",10/10,"The original trilogy of Star Wars contain three films, all of which are sophisticated, imaginative and enormous fun. I feared it wouldn't be my thing, but it was exactly that. I loved the original trilogy for all those reasons. Empire Strikes Back maintains all the fun of its predecessor, while even darker and more mature. Visually it's a marvel to look at, with the stunning special effects and highly imaginative-looking sets. John Williams's score is just outstanding, epic and monumental in every way. The story is darker than that of New Hope and perhaps more sophisticated, and I loved the fact the filmmakers made the romance between Leia and Han more developed. The battle sequences are mesmerising, the beginning is bound to have you on the edge of your seat, but the battle between Luke and Darth Vader was simply out of this world. The script is still as affectionate as ever, the pace is fast and the acting is great. Mark Hamill is ever as likable as Luke, and Carrie Fisher still has her spunk and vivacity. Harrison Ford is noticeably more subdued, but he is still terrific, and Frank Oz is a perfect Yoda. Chewabacca is hilarious, and Darth Vader is a fantastic villain, especially when voiced so magnificently by James Earl Jones. All in all, a perfect successor to an already brilliant first film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
kevin_robbins,"Mar 21, 2022",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980) is a movie in my DVD collection that I recently watched again on Disney+. The storyline picks up where Star Wars left off with the rebellion building their army and the evil Empire rebounding from losing the Death Star. Luke will try to master the powers of the force by searching for a new Jedi to train him; meanwhile, as he digs into his past he discovers more about how he became a Jedi to begin with.This movie is directed by Irvin Kershner (Robocop 2) and stars Mark Hamill (Sushi Girl), Harrison Ford (Clear and Present Danger), Carrie Fisher (Sorority Row), Billy Dee Williams (Nighthawks) and James Earl Jones (Coming to America).The Empire Strikes Back was always one of my favorites in the original trilogy. The opening yeti scene was fantastic and a great way tp start the film. The Princess and Hans scenes were hilarious and the banter makes you laugh no matter how many times you've seen it. Yoda is a legendary character introduced in this film and the Hans stasis scene is always sad. The final Luke vs Vader scene is also legendary and fun to watch unfold.Overall this is among the all time great science fiction movies that is an absolute must see. This is an easy 10/10."
up2u,"Sep 10, 1998",10/10,"This is my favorite of the classic Star Wars trilogy! It is the most suspenseful of the three and, as great as the other two are, they don't flow like this one does. This one explores the relationships instead of just action sequences (which are good in all three, though). The romance between Han and Leia and the one between Luke and Yoda, for example. This does have the best action sequence of the three of them, though; the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader. Pure brilliance!"
M_Niemeijer,"Aug 5, 2005",6/10,"The only reason this film has such high marks is because people have grown up on 'Star Wars'. A simple story and impressive special effects for its time seems to have had an amazing impact in its day (which is long before mine) but should in hindsight be seen in a new light. It is no coincidence that the new Star Wars films receive such low marks (even though much of the acting and special effects are better) because they can't live up to those old childhood memories. Lucas wasn't even that original, given that Star Trek (and many other science fiction films) came before this. The Star Wars films pass for their special effects and level of entertainment but are clearly over-hyped and definitely overrated.."
TxMike,"Oct 7, 2004",N/A,"My five children were all pre-teens when 'The Empire Strikes Back' came to the theater. While there had been other Sci-Fi movies with a theme of conflict in outer space, the 'Star Wars' trilogy filled our imaginations like no other movies before them. The fantastic, strange worlds were presented almost like we were there too. Aliens sitting around a tavern, enjoying drinks and speaking in all sorts of languages. Nothing before had approached the sheer size of the space ships depicted here, huge cities traveling all over the galaxy. And how about the jump to hyper speed, then disappearing from the screen as the speed exceeds light speed! And the light sabres of the Jedi Knights. The Jedi Knights, a striking parallel to the Japanese Samurai.It is fruitless trying to argue 'which is best' in a trilogy, because the first one, in this case 'Star Wars', starts it all and has to be the 'father'. However, an argument can be made that 'The Empire Strikes Back' (now on DVD called Episode V) is overall a better-made movie which has more excitement, and grabs your imagination,than the other two original installments (now called parts IV and VI). The DVDs finally came out last month, and they are near perfect, as we should expect from Lucas Films and THX. The bit rate is high, and the picture is nothing short of superb. As is the Dolby EX surround track.My wife and I watched all three of the movies on DVD this week -- Star Wars, Empire Strikes Back, and Return of the Jedi -- compliments of our local public library. It was an appropriate reminder how good these movies are, and still ahead of their time. Nothing else has been made to compare to them."
Movie Nuttball,"Apr 2, 2002",10/10,"The sequel to Star Wars is argueably the best of all the Star Wars films.This is much darker than the 1st one.Look for the Super Star Destroyer,it is a awesome ship.Boba Fett makes his fist appearence here.The chase scene the M.Falcon is being chased down by the Star Destroyers and Tie Fighters is really a cool scene.I f you like the 1st Star Wars then you will love this one!Note: The special edition has added scenes,special effects,sounds,and creatures. To ME the highlight of this special edition is seeing the Wampa monster!"
claudio_carvalho,"Dec 13, 2015",10/10,"The rebels' new base is hidden in the icy planet Hoth and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) commands a unit with Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew). During the investigation of a meteor crash, Luke is wounded and captured by a creature but succeeds to escape. While dying on the snow, he has a vision of Obi-Wan Kenobi telling him to go to the Dagobah system to be trained by the Jedi Master Yoda. Later he is saved by Han and they are rescued in the morning by the rebels. Meanwhile Darth Vader (David Prowse) sends probe droids through the galaxy to find the location of the base. The rebels are located and they need to leave the planet under the attack of the Imperial Fleet. However Luke heads to Dagobah to find Yoda while Leia, Han, Chewbacca and C-3PO travel to the planet Bespin to meet his friend Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and repair the Millennium Falcon. However, they are betrayed by Lando and captured by Darth Vader. Meanwhile Luke has a premonition with his friends in danger and he decides to interrupt his training with Yoda to save them, despite the warning of Obi-Wan and Yoda. Will Luke be ready to face Darth Vader and save his friends?""The Empire Strikes Back"", later retitled ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a fantastic sequel of Star Wars, with a great story. The plot has adventure, romance, comedy and betrayal and is engaging until the very end. The characters now are more experienced and bonded. The mannerisms of C-3PO recalls Dr. Smith, from ""Lost in Space"". This is the type of sequel that keeps the high quality of the original film. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""O Império Contra-Ataca"" (""The Empire Strikes Back"")"
kobemackenzie,"Aug 10, 2022",10/10,"Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) and Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) face attack by the Imperial forces and its AT-AT walkers on the ice planet Hoth. While Han and Leia escape in the Millennium Falcon, Luke travels to Dagobah in search of Yoda. Only with the Jedi master's help will Luke survive when the dark side of the Force beckons him into the ultimate duel with Darth Vader (David Prowse).This has to be my favourite Star Wars movie out of them all! This movie does everything way better than the first with great character Development will all characters and the introduction of 2 new characters, a smuggler from Hans past and a badass bounty hunter. The most has great special effects and a great musical score by John Williams again! The sets are so good to look at and the characters are so much more likeable in this movie!The movie also becomes way more darker than the last one.Mark Hamill does a way better job playing Luke even becoming more likeable. Carrie Fisher is still the likeable princess from the first one. Harrison Ford is still as likeable from the first one and him and Leia relationship is way more drawn out. Chewbacca is hilarious in this movie. Billy Dee Williams is a welcomed addition to this movie! James Earl Jones is menacing Vader!Overall this is the best Star Wars movie to date!"
alindsayal,"Dec 12, 2021",10/10,"So my next step in watching Star Wars films is the 2nd film released The Empire Strikes Back and I'm going to spoil the review for anybody watching this is my favourite film I have ever seen so expect me to be very positive about this film. The premise of the film sees Luke Skywalker travel to the planet Dagobah and learn from a Jedi Master in order to improve his skills, while Leia, Han, Chewbacca & C-3PO are on the run from The Empire with Darth Vader in charge of everything.Main Character
There is sometimes some criticism of Mark Hamill's performance in the first two Star Wars films because he does complain and wine quite a bit. However, I think this helps make this character feel interesting to me, the other two jedi's we meet in the first two films in Obi-Wan & Yoda are very wise and all knowing so easy to respect but hard to relate to. Luke is us the audience, we don't understand the teachings of the Jedi and we get frustrated easily, Luke makes mistakes as a character which makes him easier to root for as he feels very human compared to these other characters who feel like gods. This film does a great job in making Luke flawed but also making us care about him and want to see him succeed in his mission despite these flaws.Supporting Characters
As mentioned in my previous review Harrison Ford as Han Solo & Carrie Fish as Leia are brilliant supporting characters and they are great in this film together. They have so much charisma and there chemistry together is off the charts (probably due to real life chemistry), they have some of the most iconic scenes in film history together in this film and there romance really evolves in the film and feels very natural and appropriate for the two characters on screen. Now onto possibly the star of the show the character of Darth Vader, in A New Hope we are given a brief introduction to Vader but in this film he is centre stage and he is the embodiment of pure evil in this film. He is menacing and you are scared of his power as we aren't really shown that in the previous film, he is very commanding and you learn more about his character that makes him even more interesting then he was in the previous film. Frank Oz voices Yoda in the film and he was a great addition to the film, you can really see how wise Yoda is as a character and I really liked his dynamic with Luke in the film as you see two people pretty much at different points of life and how they treat things which leads to them clashing. Billy Dee Williams plays Lando Carrissian, a smuggler that are heroes meet and he also has loads of charisma and charm to him even though you can tell he maybe isn't as honest as he lets on and like Han from the previosu film he has his own motivations to help the team.Story
This film takes risks with its story by splitting the characters up into two different storylines but it really pays off. You have the slower but really interesting personal story with Luke & Yoda and you have the faster more exciting romantic story involving Han & Leia. They both mesh incredibly well and they both give an audience member different things to enjoy and it allows the pacing to feel perfect and well done. Obviously this film has some twists in it that are very well known but I wn't mention them specifically in case there is somebody who doesn't know about it, but it is all handled perfectly and really adds drama to this film but also the future films aswell that was pretty revolutionary at the time and even holds up now even though I know the twists.Script
The script for this film is so well written, the dialogue makes the characters feel so real and the drama is amped up in this one to truly make you care about the characters and the plight that they are in. The humour is good too especially with Han & Leia as it fits there characters perfectly and feels right for them and their romance. Also the twists are perfectly handled and written brilliantly to allow you to really sink them in and understand them.Style
This film's style is darker then A New Hope but it feels right as the heroes are plunged into a darker story and as the title of the film suggests the villains are all over them from very early on. In terms of action scenes The Battle of Hoth at the beginning of the film is one of my favourite battles not just in Star Wars history but in film history. Also the lightsaber battle between Vader & Luke is faster and just as personal as the one between Vader & Obi-Wan making it more exciting and a much better watch. Also John Williams score is even better in this film and really adds to the suspense and the darker story that is being told. I should also mention that I watched the newer Blu Ray version but unlike A New Hope the changes are very small and I actually thought they were fine and didn't change the film one bit.Overall
Overall, I literally struggle to find any faults with this movie. It is the perfect middle part of a trilogy and should be watched as that so watch A New Hope, Empire Strikes Back & Return Of The Jedi in a short time frame to truly appreciate the development of the characters and the story. With this being my favourite film of all time I heavily recommend this film and the other two films in the trilogy.Rating - 10/10."
emeraldreprobates,"Sep 3, 2015",7/10,"The second installment of the original Star Wars trilogy benefits from coming from a time when there were very few films that could be called that. If it was made and released now it would be lost in a sea of big budget battles of good and evil aimed at making big money for a week or two and then disappearing.Thankfully it's from a time when it became one of the biggest films of the year or even the decade and it went on to inspire what the film industry is today. Without Star Wars and its army of nerds leading the way, there is no Marvel attempt to take over films and no comic-con and you would be looking at a very different world.This film has great moment and legendary quotes or misquotes and of course it has its flaws but what blockbuster doesn't and in the end it is a Star Wars film so it's worth watching.Featured on Episode 69 of The Emerald Reprobates Podcast."
jennifer_litchfield,"Jan 12, 2003",4/10,"Star Wars - Episode V, The Empire Strikes Back, rather suffers from 'middle child' syndrome.  Being the second of the original trilogy it has neither the fresh appeal of originality that marked its predecessor, nor is it required to reach any conclusions.  The result is a film with decidedly minimalist plot development.  The Empire is still hunting down the Rebel Alliance, Luke Skywalker is still training to be a Jedi knight, and. . . . .. . . . . well, that's pretty much it.  Instead of a solid storyline, the viewer is treated to 122 minutes of cobbled-together battle sequences (although watch for the impressive Imperial walker troop carriers, which resemble out-sized armoured elephants).The characters however, have developed considerably since the first film - it's nice to see loyal Chewbacca show a sense of humour.  The sexual tension between Princess Leia and Han Solo is palpable. . . . . . . . . . until they kiss (which looks about as exciting as snogging a shoe).  In a clever twist, Yoda the Jedi Master is not a Hercules-type warrior, but a wizened green dwarf; the characterisation would have worked even better had he not had a voice a-la-Sesame Street.In the Special Edition of Episode IV, A New Hope, there is an obvious and uncomfortable chasm between those scenes which have been unaltered since they were shot in 1977 and those that were digitally re-mastered and altered 20 years later.  Fortunately the same is not the case in Episode V.  But why was it necessary to darken the picture contrast so drastically?For fanatics The Empire Strikes Back is of course an integral component of the Star Wars dynasty.  Viewers with a more casual interest in the story could probably get away with skipping this installment altogether."
antonjsw1,"Sep 12, 2010",N/A,"Congratulations have to go to line producer Gary Kurtz and director Irvin Kershner in pushing the production to out-perform A New Hope, even though the consequence was a film that came in massively over budget, and almost cost Lucas his hard fought independence from the Hollywood system.The plot moves quickly, from an interesting script by Leigh Bracket and Larry Kasdan, focusing on exploring two key relationships. The first is the relationship between Han Solo and Leia Organa, which is touched upon in a New Hope, but is fleshed out more in this film. The other is the more central relationship between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. This relationship is also linked in to the main supporting character in this film, Yoda, who is fantastically well realised by the film crew and performed brilliantly by Frank Oz. There are other characters, but whereas C3P0 and R2D2 were a central part of the story in the previous film, they are more on the sidelines.What makes this film so great though is the involving and effective way the relationships operate within the broader story. The banter between Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher is highly effective and amusing, operating through the classical love-hate relationship. One senses that Kershner, as a director of character driven films, worked very effectively with the actors and gave them the space to develop their characters which meant plenty of choices for the director in terms of their performances. The same goes for Mark Hamill's interaction with Yoda(Frank Oz). This is totally convincing and builds up the confrontation with Darth Vader very well. It was time well spent in getting these performances right. Kershner is very good at keeping the performance naturalistic, but reduces the level of broadness in the characters, making them more complex and interesting. Darth Vader benefits from this with scenes in the film that add to the mystique of the character. The confrontation with Luke Skywalker is riveting and dramatic and elevates the film above the level of its predecessor.Technically the film is even more impressive than its predecessor. Credit has to go the Oscar nominated Art Direction team. John Barry, who had worked on the previous film, passed away during the production, but Norman Reynolds led the team superbly, with the excellent creations of Dagobah and Hoth, albeit Bespin in the original does feel a bit like a set, and the digital embellishments in the special edition were helpful in creating a bigger feel to those scenes. However, I was disappointed in the reworked scene with Palpatine in the special edition - while putting the excellent Ian McDiarmid was supporting continuity, to show him face on was, in my view an error and the reworked scene would have played much better with his face shrouded, or at the least partially obscured. The whole point of the scene was that the dialogue as strong enough without the need to ram an unsubtle visual at the audience.Editing is excellent, led by Star Wars veteran Paul Hirsch, but it is known that both George Lucas, and his then wife Marcia were also heavily involved in putting the film together. Peter Suschitzky's photography is more conventional and low key in approach than A New Hope, but is particularly effective on the Dagobah scenes in Elstree Studios, and the location scenes in Norway.ILM's visual effects were outstanding, and rightly won an Academy Award. The crew consisted of the following: Oscar winning A New Hope veteran Richard Edlund, working with British effects supervisor Brian Johnson (who had just won an Oscar for Alien), effects photographer Dennis Muren (who would become an award winning and digital effects pioneer for ILM for ET, Return of the Jedi, Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom, Innerspace, The Abyss, T2 and Jurassic Park) and compositor Bruce Nicholson, who would go on to win an Oscar for his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark, and work on a wide variety of films in Hollywood. George Lucas took a strong interest and influence in the special effects and also has to take credit for some of the excellent sequences in the film, which also work because they help drive the story along.Again, like a New Hope, sound work was first rate and Oscar winning. In most cases the sound has to be recorded in a studio and added many months after filming has been completed. Sound re-recordist Bill Varney would win another Oscar for Raiders of the Lost Ark. Steve Maslow and Gregg Landaker also worked as sound-recordists and are both prolific contributors to many high profile movies. They would also win Oscars for their work on Raiders and then some fourteen years later win again for their work on the Keanu Reeves hit movie Speed. Peter Sutton won for his on–set work and has a large body of work in film since this movie. Also credit has to go the Ben Burtt's sound design work, which creates a fabulous sound-scape for the film.However, despite the above outstanding technical contributions, which serve to enhance and exciting and interesting story, it is composer John Williams who, yet again, takes this film to another level with another astounding musical score. Working with the director and producers, Williams develops and expands original themes. He creates a new and unforgettable theme for Darth Vader, with strong militaristic overtones, and clever themes for Leia and Han, and for Yoda. He weaves the score into the film expertly, giving moments of tension, excitement, thoughtfulness, mystery and tragedy with aplomb. The score feels more operatic than a New Hope, and helps cement this as one of the best adventure/fantasy films ever made.Congratulations to Mr Lucas for delivering a remarkable sequel, but also to Gary Kurtz and Irvin Kershner for having the courage to push everyone out of their comfort zones so as to reach this level of excellence."
slokes,"Aug 23, 2005",8/10,"After being abruptly evicted from his Death Star digs, Darth Vader seeks out the young rebel warrior responsible, Luke Skywalker. He has plans for the boy. Skywalker, meanwhile, leaves his friends in the middle of an Imperial invasion for a crash course in Jedi Knighthood amid a desolate swampworld with only a faultfinding green gnome for company. Can Luke complete his training before Darth reels him in?Well, no, actually. That's not the only way this middle installment of the ""Star Wars"" trilogy leaves things on a decidedly more discordant note than the previous, joyous ""Star Wars."" People call this the darkest of the original three films because it is, but ""Empire"" is the only one with an adult orientation. The characters are deepened, and our investment in them from the first film challenged by events that leave them exposed to the sort of cruelties we wrongly assumed them safe from.George Lucas deserves major praise for putting such a film together, using his well-earned profits from the first film. In essence, he was literally giving the fans back some dividends for their box office proceeds. He also took chances in terms of leaving them less happy this time, knowing the emotional payoff would have to come a film later.""Empire Strikes Back"" is thus a richer film than ""Star Wars"" emotionally, and in other ways, too. Instead of confining most of the action to the desert planet Tatoonie, the action bounces around from an ice planet to a swamp planet to the most marvelous creation of all, a city hovering high in the clouds of a gas giant, where the action culminates.Lucas adds some interesting new characters, particularly Yoda, the swamp creature Luke goes to for help, who articulates much of the philosophy and provides much of the fun in this film as voiced by Frank Oz, the guy behind (or under) Miss Piggy and later, a talented director in his own right.There's also Billy Dee Williams as Lando Calrissian, the operator of Cloud City who provides much of the needed moral shading in the film as the stars from the previous movie are all full-blown heroes now. Williams has fun schmoozing up Leia and trying to find his feet as his slick machinations leave him in ever-hotter water.The best performance in this film is Mark Hamill's as Luke. Hamill had to work harder here than he did in ""Star Wars,"" sharing all his big scenes with a Muppet and a guy with a bucket on his head. But Hamill finds the essence of a character more interesting than the naive farmboy we saw in the first film, playing Luke as confused, fearful, impetuous, and flawed in a way that makes him more likable, rather than less so. How Hamill never hit it big after his great work here is an injustice on par with Cleavon Little's lack of work after ""Blazing Saddles.""What else about this is great? The score by John Williams, introducing the recognizable ""Imperial March"" theme music as well as some rousing material during the final confrontation between Luke and Darth. The interaction between Vader and his subordinates is chokingly funny, in a way that only adds to the suspense and dread. The opening battle around the ice planet is marvelously intense, especially as witnessed from the cockpits of Rebel fighters taking on thickly-armored Imperial walkers.The returning cast except for Hamill doesn't seem as sharp this time, especially Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia, so charming in ""Star Wars,"" gaunt and miserable here. Much of the whole middle section of the film is draggy and woolly, like the various silly ways the Millennium Falcon escapes Imperial pursuit and the scene in the ""cave"" that goes on much longer than it should. Even Luke's scenes with Yoda become slow and tedious with multiple viewings.The enthusiasm that makes ""Empire Strikes Back"" so beloved today is understandable. It turned ""Star Wars"" from a great film into an enjoyable franchise. But it doesn't really have the same stand-alone quality ""Star Wars"" has, needing both that earlier film and the later ""Return Of The Jedi"" to make it as great as it is."
FlikJedi719,"Jan 3, 2020",10/10,"Empire Strikes Back is by far the best of the original trilogy. I'm sure there were plot twists before 1980, but this movie has to go down in history as the best and biggest plot twist ever with just 3 words: ""I'm your father"".Everything about this movie is better than A New Hope (and A New Hope was a 9/10 for me) including: the lightsaber battle, the special effects (which still hold up to an extent to this day), Yoda, a deeper dive into the universe through character and creature introductions, and of course more of Darth Vader. The lines quoted by Yoda throughout his sequenes are some of the best known movie quotes of all time as well. John Williams continues to deliver with his score and character themes too. This movie is just a classic and absolutely my favorite movie out of all 9.Final grade: Absolutely a 10/10"
xewosa,"Dec 24, 2021",10/10,"This is a Hollywood masterclass on how to make a good sequel. 'A New Hope' was a fantastic movie, and 'The Empire Strikes Back' improved on it greatly. Awesome story-telling, great action, the movie is just wonderful. Go watch it. 10/10."
BenjaminPopkin,"Mar 30, 2022",10/10,"This film is as Star Wars as Star Wars gets in that it is one of if not the best story told in the franchise. Empire Strikes Back takes everything that was good about A New Hope and just completely expands upon it. It is arguably the greatest sequel in cinematic history.Each character is given more emotional depth including Luke, Leia, Han, and even Vader this time. A New Hope is a fun movie, this movie feels more like an emotional experience in comparison. This is the first film in which the Imperial March, one of the best songs created for a movie ever is heard. Also, this movie contains probably the most shocking reveal in all of cinematic history.The sets are more grand, the effects are more spectacular, and the music is absolutely some of the best in all of Star Wars. The film sets genuinely feel completely real. From Hoth to Dagobah to Bespin the locations in this film are so incredibly detailed and well made. Dagobah especially feels like a completely different planet. None of the sets even feel like sets. They feel like real places. Also the special effects are marvelous especially for its time. The asteroid belt scene in particular is not only breathtaking to see but the music mixed in as well makes it so much fun to watch.Which brings me to the action. Much more fun and much more grand in comparison to A New Hope. The opening Hoth battle is such a great scene not only because of the special effects and the captivating action but also because of the stakes. The fact that we are following all the characters and they are all doing something makes it feel like they are actually in trouble and it makes for an engrossing scene. The fight with Luke and Vader is also a great action scene. The scene where Luke is looking for his friends and runs into Vader. The lack of music, the choreography, and all the colors work together to tell the story. One of the best set ups to a fight, like ever. The fight itself is very emotional for both characters which leads up to the big reveal at the end. Luke willingly chose death over joining Vader. It's a cliffhanger, literally.I feel like the Yoda stuff is shorter than it should be. Don't get me wrong I think the training scenes with Yoda on Dagobah are great. But, it feels too short and almost underwhelming. It starts off very funny when we meet Yoda, I love that scene after Luke crashes. I also think the dialogue between Yoda and Luke as well as Yoda and Ben is really well written. Yoda feels like a goofball at first, but quickly begins to come out as a genuine and wise character. All of those scenes are extremely quotable as well like Yoda says some really smart things. In the end it feels like Lukes training is extremely rushed and I understand it's because he chose to leave, but still I would have liked to see more. That doesn't mean I don't appreciate the scenes we did get. The tie fighter scene is awesome and I think about Yoda's quotes to Luke on a daily basis.Overall, The Empire Strikes Back is honestly a masterpiece of cinema. It is one of the best movies ever made without a doubt. The characters all have so much more depth to them. It completely steps it up in comparison to A New Hope. In terms of the character development, special effects, script, and execution. There is never a dull moment, and it is filled with iconic moments. The whole third act is so emotionally powerful. The scene where they lose Han, and then the Vader and Luke scene afterwards. Such well shot, emotional and beautifully filmed scenes. It ends with one of the best cliffhangers ever. Everyone is on a low note, and no one knows what's gonna happen next. The Empire Strikes Back is nothing shy of a masterpiece. *chefs kiss*I like New Hope better because it's much more simple and fun. Revenge of the Sith is my favorite, easily."
inxsfett,"Dec 19, 2013",10/10,I remember to see this movie with my father(R.I.P)in theaters and in that time you don't know nothing about the movie is not like this times that you have magazinez and web to know everything about the movie so i was in 0 when i got to see it.Of course i see STAR WARS about 7 u 8 times and i was amazing when i see this movie i was open mouth..so dark so mysterius so thriller so tragic i mean everything in this movie was perfect.I can't believe that is almost 35 years of this movie and still looks great with new effects o not look's great!!!.That's why all the fans of SW knows that this is the best movie of the saga and simply one of the best sequels ever make in movie story!!!.
BA_Harrison,"Mar 3, 2007",10/10,"From it's opening scenes on the bleak ice-ball that is the planet Hoth, to its exciting finale on the cloud city of Bespin, The Empire Strikes back is a worthy sequel to the magnificent Star Wars. Taking over the directorial reins from George Lucas, Irvin Kershner steers the movie into darker territory to deliver a more mature movie than its predecessor.The Empire is still licking its wounds after the destruction of the Death Star, and evil Darth Vader is intent on finding the rebels responsible for destroying his new toy. Luke's aim, meanwhile, is to become a fully fledged Jedi knight, whilst Han sets himself a more difficult target: he plans on getting into Leia's knickers.With more incredible FX packed action scenes than you can shake a light-sabre at (highlights include the fantastic battle on Hoth, a chase scene through an asteroid field, and the Luke/Darth light-sabre duel), and THAT moment where we learn the truth about Luke's father, it's no surprise to find that this episode is often said to be the best of the series. Personally, A New Hope will always be my favourite (for sentimental reasons), but The Empire Strikes Back is a very close second."

mroyleevatt,"Feb 19, 2019",10/10,"Some films you love because you can't separate your childhood from your view, but this is as good as popcorn entertainment gets either way. I've watched and watched and now my son loves, if only you can get hold of the untinkered version it's just brilliant."
Spondonman,"Jun 1, 2014",7/10,"Back in 1977 I really enjoyed the first film in the franchise, but the hype was so enormous when this came out I decided to avoid it for a bit. I finally caught up with it in 1997 by which time Time had sadly caught up with it too and wreaked its usual damage. Then it was a case of Roll Over Harryhausen, tell Jim Henson the news.Story has imaginative intergalactic politics and battles amidst a plethora of gormless soap and stereotypes. To a kid it would be marvellous stuff to watch and as an adult to revel in through rose-tinted glasses, but coming at it as an adult I see it through the Empire's, sorry, Emperor's New Clothes and in the Altogether. It's relentlessly inventive but not in my top 1000 films of all time. Favourite bits: Luke yakking to Kermit about the Force; the flying city where expense or common sense is no object; the love affair between the Princess and the Scoundrel; the remarkably obvious pay-off, hyped at the time as something groundbreaking.The first cut is nearly always the deepest - long live the brash first film, this sequel is entertaining and nonsensical, an eminent time-passer. The first was a monument to Luck, the second a monument to Hype; I love fantasy movies of all eras and genres but mainly those not surrounded by heaps of hype swallowed by millions of people, it's a real barrier to my complete enjoyment of anything. This is a watchable movie but only a must-watch movie to see for what digital cgi cartoonery has done to the movies, and to us. Modern cgi is usually cold and soulless but usually not jerky and laughable, cgi has spoilt us all and there's no going back. However, now to watch Jason & The Argonauts and curse Roger Rabbit."
FeastMode,"Dec 26, 2019",4/10,"Hey!!! breath of fresh air after the garbage that was episode VI. it still wasn't good overall, but significantly more watchable. a few cool action scenes, the light saber fights were decent. better characters, better story. acting still bad, except han, he's pretty awesome. still lots of stupid parts and old movie qualities.

stani_a,"Jan 17, 2016",10/10,"By far my favorite Star Wars movie. Contains the iconic parts of the saga, for example the reveal of Darth Vader. The settings for the entire movie are outstanding from Hoth to Cloud City. As always the score from John Williams was on point more so than ever in my opinion. The movie is set between episodes 4 and 6 doing a perfect job of not only carrying through the success of the first movie and surpassing it in my opinion but also does an amazing job of setting up episode 6 to conclude the trilogy without leaving an annoying cliffhanger at the last minute. The characters really establish themselves with more famous moments such as Han Solo's ""I know"" line towards the end of the movie and we get to see Luke's agony as he hangs from cloud city."
The_Rider2004,"Dec 23, 2025",10/10,"This extends upon the original and does something different and unique with the characters and the storyline Balances the darker tones and the narratives that feeds the audiences attention and gives us some major Easter eggs. The tone is so good here balancing the darker, more grittier side of the universe, and every dark moment you get a polished and colourful look and a lighter tone, such as R2D2 some humour and fun into the mix of this sci-fi world that just captivates audiences.Darf Vader has such a dark demeanour but an epitome of emotion who's angered and enraged by his father and his princess that turns him into the darkside but still has emotion and can control his powers. The scene at the start of the film captures the essence of 'bad guys can win' and with enough power it elevates the scenes, his voice is stern and cold, his body is dark and he's brash with his powers and rushes to make bad decisions that costs him.The C-3Po is at his funniest here with so much more acknowledgement of his character and it's rather sweet and beutiful actually when you look at him with R2D2 it's a very clever mixture of fun and a sense of warmth added to the mix, because you get to see them connect as Robots and it's fascinating and entertaining. Jumbled into one big surprise of Satisfaction for the audiences.The characters having more emotive feelings, more phrases, more memorable jule fights, some laughs. It really does bond together and makes a perfect story even better and a good story is even stronger when all the actors are at their A Game. Natalie Portman is here, and she's the queen, she has a good role and I like her swift tone at times like her darker tones, but can also match that with her solis but have so much empathy.Either way this film made me a fan of TV, and sci-fi for years, its powerful tone made me fall in love with characters, the story made me feel something. It's such a great film that's superbly entertaining and it wonderfully illustrates the themes of sadness and happiness but also blended with curiosity. And it gets the action and dialogue so spot on your entertained throughout. This is my last review, so I decided to go out on a good note, 10/10."
PeterPPK,"Oct 26, 2009",10/10,"The first Star Wars movie, is a Sci-fi and cinematic masterpiece. But where Star Wars capitalized, Empire Strikes Back took it to the next level.Here's what I think of the movie:Story - I'm pretty sure we all know the story of Star Wars. A Galactic Empire is empowering the galaxy, and a Rebel Alliance tries to stop it. Today, it's sort of a cliché plot but back then, it was imagination skyrocketing into the heavens. Now, thats the plot of Star Wars. The story spans from a battle on the frigid planet of Hoth, to a space dogfight in an asteroid field, to Cloud City where the greatest plot twist in the history of cinema, is reveled. The film ends on a cliffhanger which leads to Return of the Jedi. I'm not going to spoil it, but I don't think I would need to because I'm willing to bet that about 99.99% of people have already seen this movie anyway(to that .01%, where the hell have you been?).-Rating 10/10Characters - The characters from the original movie are back, including Luke, Han, Leia, C3P0 and R2D2, and of course, Darth Vader. But the films also introduces some new characters as well, including Lando, The Emperor, Boba Fett, and Yoda. The Emperor doesn't really play a big part in the movie(I think he only has like, 10 lines) and Boba's name is never really mentioned. However, Yoda plays a big part by teaching Luke the ways of the force, and Lando, who is Han's old pal, plays a big part by betraying our heroes and giving them to Vader. Of course, he's still a good guy, he had to hand them over. Overall, I'd say the characters are still great.Rating 10/10Visuals - This was back when Star Wars movies didn't rape the fabric of CGI. So what you see in the movie were real things. The Walkers, asteroids, X-Wings, Tie Fighters, everything. The original Star Wars set the standards for Special Effects with the light sabers, Death Stars blowing up and everything. Empire Strikes Back isn't any different. The Effects are still awesome and look great.-Rating 10/10Music - The Star Wars theme is (of course) still here and it's one of the most recognized themes in cinema. You only need to hear a second of the Star Wars theme, and you'll know what it is. Like any other Star Wars film, the music is composed by John Williams, so everything is played by an orchestra. Even though it's great the here the Star Wars theme in all it's nostalgic glory, the music thats played is still just as great.-Rating 10/10Overall - Empire Strikes back is my favorite Star Wars film and is one of my favorite movies. If I had to make a Top 10 list of my favorite movies, about 15 movies would be tied for the #1 spot, and this would be one of them. Everything about it is just perfect.Final rating : 10/10-PeterPPK"
markuslorenz,"Dec 24, 2019",10/10,It ist the best Star Wars Film. The atmosphere in this Film ist just awesome.
hazzahamnwardy,"Nov 30, 2018",10/10,"Wow, what a film, I never knew that I could love a film soooo much in my life, but here it is, my favourite film of all time, the one that made me love Star Wars. First of all, the acting in this film is amazing, People who watched the film didn't know that actually most of Harrison Ford's lines were improvised, which is awesome. Carrie Fisher as Leia was great, especially when she talks to Ford, Frank Oz as Yoda is great, way better than CGI Yoda from the prequels. Luke as the hero was great, but I like how they show Luke as the hero, but he still loses, which brings me to Darth Vader. He is by far one of the best villains of all movie history, he is menacing, mysterious, then when he tells Luke, ""I am your father"", that completely changes how we first watched A New Hope. Effects are good for that time, also two others characters that I need to mention are Boba Fett and Lando Calrissian, these two characters really showed me that this is such a great movie franchise, Lando with huge charisma, and Boba being silent badass, so out of ten I would give this incredible movie a 10/10. Perfection."
P97,"Feb 19, 2019",10/10,"And one of the best movies in general, it's better than a new hope in every way possible and it's one of the strongest sequels in the cinema.the scenes with luke and yoda are some of the best in the saga and yoda's way of teaching luke is really beautiful, it's as much as a master apprentice as it can get.and my god that third act is just iconic and the ending is so magical, peaceful and sad at the same time."
tedg,"Feb 15, 2007",N/A,"The SonI am convinced that movies are about other movies more than life. The original ""Star Wars"" was a success in my opinion because it had three things: a collection of images from other films, distinctly referencing them. Some were film- schoolish like the Kurosawa quotes. But most were like what Kurosawa himself referenced: already deeply embedded visual touchstones, not having lost their power in becoming clichés. These were collected in one large form, the Flash Gordan form let's call it, which all of us slightly knew. It could be recalled with enough familiarity to register but not enough to set expectations, so Lucas could fill the bucket with whatever he found and liked. a notion of a complete, understandable cosmology. Its the noir notion that laws of the universe exist and cannot be seen, and if they could they wouldn't be comprehensible. This notion is deep in film, so deep that when a movie comes along that posits a cosmology that is whole, and revealable, it shocks. What that movie did was give us enough of a glimpse into this to believe that we could understand the world, at least THIS world of the ""galaxy far away."" Remember when that original came out? The images were impressible, but what people talked about wasn't what they saw, but about how the world worked. It settled first in an ersatz religion among geeky kids and now has been swallowed by the ""simple"" US religions, and its presidential representative. the notion of a quest. Its an old form, but cast in the above noted situation, it takes new power. The traditional form, the Goethe-Lytton form was there to remind and reveal mysteries. Here it is clearer, to explain. There was a lowbrow professor at the time of a women's college that a TeeVee interviewer made popular. It was sort of a metaquest. This simple man said that we could actually understand the nature of trying to understand nature. It was a lucky break for Lucas, because it meshed with this shocking notion of a grand cosmology that we know our hero (check out the name: ""sky walker"") will grasp, master and show us.That was the first film. A huge success, just huge. It did change many things, but from my perspective the key thing was how it reset that great American invention of noir, as important as jazz, and liberty which form a sort of trilogy of contradictory, three-way tension.Okay. Now the second big Ted idea, the necessity for the equal size of steps in abstraction when you have two steps. It seems this is hardwired in the brain, a sort of human quantum mechanics. If you look back along the abstraction, say a cartoon in a cartoon, the distance between the two will be precisely the same as the surrounding cartoon.So, when they made the second Star Wars movie, they could reference the previous one in the way that it referenced its cinematic background. It had a writer in Kasden who knew how to do this. And it had a director in Lucas' film school teacher who did also. Neither had a huge hit other than this because it was such a cool setup, having such a thing to build on.You'll read lots about trying to humanize, and how faces were used. But all that is simply in the service of abstracting closer to us from the original, in equal portion. This is the son. Why did the franchise fail after this? Because there was no step left to abstract to and maintain the brand.(This comment is a replacement of one deleted for unknown reasons. This was requested by a reader.)Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
MustafaDilek,"Dec 5, 2016",6/10,"The story (if you can speak of one)in this movie is very boring. There isn't any tension-building or climax whatsoever. The movie just stops after 2 hours. There is hardly any character building, and to my opinion there aren't many strong personalities. The only character that has won my sympathy is Han Solo,(Harrison Ford) but after being frozen he just disappears out of the movie, and no one seems to care about him anymore. Luke Skywalker is a w***er who is supposed to be a jedi knight, but instead he needs to be rescued all the time. I wouldn't have cared less if he had crashed in his plane, had been eaten by that snowmonster, had frozen to death, he got shot by the ATATs, if his father had killed him, or he had fallen of that tower. The music score is well composed, though I think a classical symphony isn't very suitable for a sci-fi movie. I believe they should have used synthetic music to create the right atmosphere. On the other hand the effects and sceneries are very impressive. Unbelieve what effort George and his guys have done!"
Jimim97,"Jan 25, 2020",10/10,There is no better Star Wars movie. The Empire Strikes Back is just perfect.
itsmagicallydelicious,"Aug 20, 2006",10/10,"This, is one of those times where it's great when the bad guys win. I had grown up watching old westerns and kiddie movies, where it was all good guys win at the end. And when I first saw this when the Original (Best) Trilogy reopened in theaters, my parents rushed me to the nearest cinema. I was astounded. Great acting. Even better directing, it's the greatest space movie pretty much ever made.It's only better because ""Star Wars"" set this one up perfectly. And it allowed a suspenseful ""Return of the Jedi"", which needed all it could get, because it was the worst of the Original's, but still pretty darn good. Overall even though it was made in the 80's it was still captivating to a boy used to computer graphics. The absolute best part was the final lightsaber battle between Vader and Luke where... well, I won't spoil it for those who haven't heard the line."
brumstrand,"Oct 24, 2005",10/10,"If the first Star Wars (1977) was groundbreaking, this one is breathtaking! According to me at least - the best picture in film history! A culminated crown-jewel after a decade of excellent drama productions, such as The Godfather I & II, one flew over the cuckoo's nest etc, etc. Everything is there.. skillful focus on the character-arch.. a relaxed and charming love story.. fantastic action and heroism.. and above all- George Lucas story! What is going on inside that man.. ""A modern age Genius"". How does he come up with all that weird but super-cool stuff! And John Williams music..!! The themes and their crafted development to the story context.. wow.. Why he didn't get the academy award, still remains one of the biggest mysteries to me, up to this day.. If you find yourself crying, getting goosebumps and laughing at the same time when viewing this piece, don't worry- You're not alone...The force is strong with this one!!"
latraradek,"Jan 25, 2020",10/10,"This film is just pure awesome, for kids, adults, and everyone in between.Anyone can watch it and get something out of it; for the kids it's the cool worlds and weird-looking creatures, for teens, it's all the cool explosions and action scenes, and adults can enjoy all the character development and darker themes this movie has to offer.This really is a magical movie."
zkonedog,"Mar 11, 2017",7/10,"In terms of action and adventure, ""Empire Strikes Back"" is a rousing success. There are enough space flights, phaser blasts, and lightsaber wielding to satisfy the visual effects junkies. The only thing missing, however, is that ""sense of something epic"" inherent in its original predecessor.In ""Episode V"", as it has come to be known, the rebels are still being pursued by the Empire, this time on the ice planet Hot. The first half of the film focuses on those battles, primarily featuring Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher). A new character in Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) is also introduced, though his loyalties are very much in question. The second half deals more with Luke Skywalker's (Mark Hamill) beginning steps to becoming a Jedi. After the death (in Part IV) of Obi-Wan Kenobi, Luke goes to continue his training with Yoda, an enigmatic little green character seemingly older than time itself. The film's climax brings forth the long-awaited meeting of Luke and Darth Vader (voice of James Earl Jones), as well as a startling (if now clichéd) revelation that sets the stage for the final chapter.Though a good movie in its own right, I always felt as if this one lagged behind the original in certain key areas. A recent watching confirmed this. I think the ""trouble"" stems from the fact that ""Empire"" is much more of an action film than a drama. Whereas ""New Hope"" was so incredibly genre-diverse, ""Empire"" takes that same cast of characters and instead relies a bit too much on laser blasts and space maneuvers. It doesn't help that certain scenes (inside the ""asteroid""; Lando's scenes) just feel a little draggy...like filler.Overall, though, this is still a very watchable film that keeps the main storyline pushing forward. For special effects or action/adventure buffs, this one will stand out. For others, it may fall just a tick behind the original."
philkil-08568,"Dec 25, 2019",10/10,An amazing film with an amazing story written by an amazing guy that we all love
umlaziking,"May 30, 2022",10/10,"It's really sad to see what star wars has become these days..unoriginal, uninspiring, lacking passion..I can go on and on and on but I just don't have the stomach for it anymore..but this movie right here, star wars empire strikes back, is just so masterfully inspiring and masterfully done. The fact that George Lucas did this movie on his own with his own money should tell you everything you need to know about how amazingly tenacious he is, not only that, he brought the characters to life..making them memorable, believable and most importantly relatable. Yes it's an old movie, yes it feels out dated...but trust me, if you look really past that and focus on its level of storytelling and the amazing writing of the story, you will understand why this movie has a rating of 8.7...most movies today and even in the last decade haven't even gotten close to that. Give it a shot...you won't be disappointed."
The_Joker_Baby,"Jan 23, 2020",10/10,"This is an example of how to not only do a perfect sequel, but a perfect sci-fi movie in general."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jun 10, 2006",9/10,"Although called ""Episode V,"" this was second movie in the Star Wars 6-part installment and I've always thought one of the better entries in the series.If you watch the first Star Wars and then this one, you'll immediately see a vast improvement in the special-effects department. There is a much more polished look to this one, and improved sound In fact, the DVD transfer is outstanding considering the age of this film.While the first Star Wars was a bit subdued, this one picks up the action right from the start, although lulls are really appreciated because the first 40 minutes are pretty hectic. The most notable of those scenes are the gigantic robots which were awesome when this film first came out, and are still pretty good. The movie calms down after that opening land war but retains the viewer's interest with other things.The second half of the movie features two stories going on at once: the battle in space with most of the cast involved, and ""Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) in a swampland involved in his training sessions with the Master Yoda.Some of the movie's dialog is still corny, especially between Han Solo (Harrison Ford) and Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) with their love-hate relationship, but it's not overdone. What is overdone is constant bleating noises emanating from ""Chewbacca,"" the wookie. That sheep-in-heat noise can get annoying after awhile. The ""Rambo"" action continues as it did in the first film, with the villains firing everything at our heroes and never hitting them. Ludicrous, but part of the deal. Those things you just put up with as the film, overall, delivers another interesting adventure, far more than the first Star Wars and leading up to the next one, which was even better."

johnnyboyz,"Jan 7, 2009",6/10,"Good lord, what spell does George Lucas have everyone under? This is one of the highest ranked films on the website; it's regarded as one of the greatest sequels of all time; it's on most lists entitled the 'greatest motions pictures' of the respective genre; it's a film nearly everyone likes - and yet it failed, for me, to do any of these things justice upon recently seeing it for the first time. Perhaps you had to be there; to see it on opening night at a time when there was no such thing as the Internet on which you could download and/or watch special teasers or trailers; at a time when the studio were not able to give you the first five minutes as an appetiser to get you to see it; at a time when the only manner in which you could discuss the up and coming franchise episodes were face-to-face and not on message boards. Although it's too bad it isn't more like that nowadays.Maybe it's futile criticising it now, but at the end of the day, it's still just a film. Perhaps you really did have to be there on opening night with no knowledge of what awaited you, preparing yourself to be propelled into a world of monsters, space travel and aliens as you left your brain at the door. But I do think most people rate the film based on childhood experiences more than the film itself  they don't ask themselves the question 'How good was the film?', they ask themselves 'How happy was I as a kid when I first saw this?'.For the record, I liked the previous episode. I thought it was good fun and relatively light-hearted with a sense of vision going for it throughout. You really believed Lucas had an idea and desperately wanted to follow through on his vision. This twinned with the scope of ideas to do with space travel and the structuring of space stations, look of attire and general mise-en-scene enforces the evidence Lucas loved an idea to the point it was an obsession, an obsession he let everyone else into and love in equal measure.Alas, Episode V entitled 'The Empire Strikes Back' from 1980 is actually quite silly and removes any feeling or excitement the prior episode may have instilled into one. Its overall idea is that the young and upcoming hero in Luke Skywalker (Hamill) is to go off and train to take his skills to the next level and become a Jedi whilst friends Han Solo (Ford) and co. are chased down by the evil forces led by Darth Vader (Prowse/Jones).'Fine' you think, this may well be more interesting now that the introductions and general establishment of good versus evil has been dealt with; there also seems to be a self discovery journey going on. But if anything, the film is less interesting than the first one, particularly after about an hour after which it transcends into a bunch of slightly interesting scenes set on space ships and odd jungle infested planets. Once all that has happened, Vader gets some hired guns to find the rebels and more stuff happens that just has you passively sit there and watch it all unfold.Maybe it's that I cannot just let myself go, but I had no problem with the 1st and 4th episodes in terms of narrative, which were actually quite interesting as this broad and quite epic setting was used to transfer good and evil across a galaxy. In this one, there doesn't feel like anything at stake. The film's protagonist Luke is safe and sound on a jungle planet with Yoda, being taught what he needs to know, so he's fine, whereas Solo and co. are hopping around trying to dodge the forces of evil and the problem is you never feel any connection to them. Why should you feel any towards an annoying, big, hairy creature; daft comic relief robots and an underdeveloped, expressionless and somewhat empty headed woman who goes by the name Leia (Fisher).But these things are the bigger picture. The film has all number of frustrations going on at spaced intervals. Of course, Solo and co. never get hit by any of the laser beams and they can hide in that meteor storm nice and easily but again, criticising it seems futile. One thing I noticed on several occasions was that everyone in the Millennium Falcon kept talking over each other, which also annoyed me and the heavy handed catalyst which pushes Luke off into his training with Yoda is a near death experience on ice planet Hoth, during which he nearly freezes to death amongst being eaten.Towards the end of the film, Luke will be having a showdown with Vader after which a famous line is uttered. All well and good but Luke doesn't go down into the bowels to fight Vader because it's the realistic choice, he goes down there because we want him to  we want him to fight and the story demands he put his new Jedi skills into practice so that all can see how much he's really learnt. This is after the film goes needlessly 'dark' for one scene involving the freezing/supposed death of a main character and no, the film is 'dark' for that one scene; not from the start and throughout, it's still that laser dodging, fast talking, monster eliminating 'fun' the prior film was. All in all, The Empire Strikes Back is underwhelming and viewing it now makes it seems quite silly more than anything. Perhaps proof 'event cinema' can and never will withstand the true test of time."
richardrobinson292,"Oct 31, 2024",5/10,"""It is useless to resist...""Nope. Actually I found it quite easy.Terrible script. Mostly dreadful acting. Lousy effects, the animals especially. Action scenes that would embarrass the most amateur production.I quite like Darth Vader, both as a character and as acted. A convincing monster. Leia is OK too, though she is cursed with a feeble part, entirely beneath the notice of a decent actress. Between them they save this from an even worse score.Luke is mostly an annoying schoolboy. Most of the rest are stock parts doing stock things. The incest theme is quite fun, though it always seems like they simply didn't notice it until the reviewers started to comment. The comedy is lame. The music is cliched, reaching its ultimate nadir in the imperial march.And this stretched to 9 episodes and half-a-dozen spin-offs? Amazing."
driveinsammy,"Nov 2, 2003",10/10,"Empire Strikes Back is not only a great sequel to one of the best science Fiction movies ever made but its probably one of the best sequels ever made. A movie that not only blows away the first film in terms of scoop and magnitude but in story telling as well. This is the second of the entire Star Wars series of movies and in no doubt, the best. Not even the movies that come after were able to capture the landscape of this great cinematic achievement.Don't dare call yourself a Star Wars fan if you have not seen it."
ftrain,"Feb 24, 2005",10/10,"As great as the original Star Wars may be, The Empire Strikes Back remains the best film in the series. As the years pass, the real achievement of Empire only grows. While the original film has grown somewhat dated in appearance, and Return of the Jedi feels a bit silly now, Empire has maintained remarkable staying power. The effects in the film feel as fresh now as they did in 1980, and as importantly the story and tone of the film still hold an ominous feel and lend the series the grandeur that made it so lasting. Without Empire, Star Wars would have been remembered but not nearly in the same way. Everything that was begun in Star Wars was expanded and improved upon here, right down to the score Remember, this was the movie that introduced the now-famous and ridiculously overplayed Imperial March composed by John Williams. And virtually every scene is now iconic--the Imperial Walkers in the snow, Luke's training in the swamp, the asteroid field chase of the Millennium Falcon, the Cloud City, Luke's lightsaber battle with Vader. When I think of ""Star Wars"", most of the images that come to mind first are from Empire. The colors and textures of the film are so sharp and rich.A truly majestic film. One of the great visual statements in the history of movies, and one of the most successful realizations of a movie vision we will ever see."
palmer-2,"Oct 4, 1998",10/10,"this is the best of the star wars trilogy,and also the best movie of all time. when i got a chance to see it agian in the big theatre, for the first time since i was in four grade i`m 27 now. was the greatest movie experience i`ve ever had.i still think its the best achieve in f/x in movie history.(star wars episode I) the phantom menace i can`t wait for the most anticipated movie of all-time. i`ll have my sleeping bag ready so i can get my ticket soon possible. i can`t miss the first showing."
DanB-4,"Apr 14, 2006",10/10,"It took many years and many viewings before I could say that I liked this film better than A New Hope. But careful examination tells all - by every conceivable measure this is a better picture. The characters are more fully developed, Vader is even more evil, the score gives us the chilling Vader theme and the story is more interesting. Now that the six films are complete, The Empire Strikes Back is even more compelling and interesting than it was before we knew its Big Secret.All great heroes are flawed, and Luke Skywalker is no exception. Empire reveals to us in full that the inner battle he will have to fight is worse than any enemy he will face. As we meet for the first time Yoda, the wise Jedi master (we find out in Sith why he is on this jungle planet), we learn what a Jedi is, what his responsibility is and just how difficult that life will be. Luke, however, wants immediate gratification - he wants to help and wants revenge.The film cuts back and forth between Han Solo and Leia's pursuit by Vader and Luke's training and ultimately leads to the greatest scene of the six films, the epic light saber battle between Luke and Vader. And, if you are one of the 12 people on the planet who do not know the outcome, the less said the better.Empire rightly holds a place in the IMDb top 10, combining Action-Adventure, space opera and even the best elements of a super-hero film, into an infinitely watchable, entertaining movie. **** out of ****."
RonellSowes,"Jul 7, 2022",10/10,"After the sensation that Star Wars was, it would seem impossible to make a worthy follow up but somehow Lucas and his team did. In fact, there's a strong argument to be made that Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back even surpassed its predecessor and is the best of the franchise/hexalogy. While I may not propound that myself, I couldn't exactly reject it either. All I can add is it does contain the best cinematography of all the films, courtesy of Peter Suschitzky."
HonestApeAbe,"Dec 12, 2022",10/10,"Trilling, excitement adventure. Yep this is what many consider to be the best Star Wars film and it's not hard to see why. Not just a great movie but an amazing sequel. Filled a great cast of Heroes and Villains. The effects 45 years later are still pretty amazing with amazing sets and puppetry work by Frank Oz, an amazing opening scene with tons of action and an ending that ends bitter sweet yet somber. Not to mention one of the best movie twist in history, with of course the only huge issue with the twist is even non Star Wars fans know what it is due to pop culture but that's basically a testament to how great it is."
Amthermandes,"Oct 28, 2022",10/10,"This is the epitome of sci-fi movie making. It's a classic, a tale that thrusts the audience into a world completely unlike their own. We love it not just for the famous twist, not just for the cultural impact it has and had on society, but simply for the story and the ground-breaking special effects, one should easily be able to see how much of an achievement this film is.It's a gripping sequel to the story that started it all. It's starts off of a cliffhanger, and ends with an even bigger one, leaving the audience wanting more. I only wish I could travel back in time to see it in theaters when it was first released."
ILLIMCMILLIN,"Dec 11, 2024",N/A,"The Empire Strikes Back is a sequel that matures itself from its very family friendly predecessor while still being a good film for children, it is a classic of cinema and defines sequels, it manages to outdo the film that changed the way films are made and defined the science fiction genre. It creates mature feelings that may go over younger viewers heads with a dreadful feeling as if they have no hope while still maintaining a hopeful feeling of rebellion. The Empire Strikes Back is the 3rd greatest film in my opinion and is a must watch film for anyone. The literal Definition of Absolute perfection of cinema."
dieseldemon85,"Apr 10, 2022",6/10,"My preference goes Return of the Jedi, A new Hope, then this one. I found the characters had better chemistry and the dialogue seemed more natural in the films of 77,83. This one I know the director was attempting to humanize the characters but thought the dialogue was forced and it lacked chemistry."
InpraiseofFolly,"Sep 8, 2004",3/10,"I decided to watch this trilogy with a completely open mind to see what the fuss was all about. I was rather embarrassed by the fact that I had never seen any of these movies which were heralded as great cinematic classics. Instead of the masterpiece I was promised however , I was left with a great mediocrity. The characters were barely 2 dimensional , the plot was riddled with holes and horribly rushed and the dialogue was cheesy . Episode V was perhaps the least painful to watch but still isn't close to being good. I don't know if it's a case of a movie aging very badly but I can't for the life of me understand the allure of it. To each their own , I guess."
cookiesap,"Jun 10, 2005",10/10,"ESB is one of the best science fiction movies of all time. In most circles, there tend to be a division between 'regular' movies and science fiction ones, but the Empire Strikes Back not only wrote the importance of the previously establish Star Wars saga into history, but borough the Joneses and Kims and N'Danou's and Guptas and everyone else from all over the world a re-lived curiosity about a genre that often is exclusively reserved to geeks, gamers, and goblins. The first star wars movie was a feat in special effects and something quite new. The Empire Strikes back, however, drew us into a new world with an amazing conviction. We were all so very much standing next to Luke and Han, so that they have almost helped share their world with us, but also influence popular culture today in a somewhat surrealistic concept, where the actors/actresses step out of the TV/silver screen and dictate the 'real' world, using their 'fantasy' world to justify for their candor - in an almost 'emperor's new clothes' fashion. Only the greatest movies have the ability to enmesh reality and the fiction on the screen. Lord of the Rings did it, Hitchcock did it, and Lucas did it! Lucas made us believe in a world far away, long long time ago, which any other creator would have made seem like another Star Trek or Stargate episode (like the prequels)."
darthgeorge1973,"Dec 17, 2004",10/10,"It's very rare when a sequel outshines the film that came before it,""The Empire Strikes Back"" manages to do that in many ways. ""Star Wars"" always will be considered an all time classic,but ""Empire"" is a great follow up.According to George Lucas,It's ""Episode V"" in his space opera. In my opinion it's the best in the series.The characters are more fleshed out this time,and the plot is more complex and darker then the previous installment. The F/X is outstanding.The film stands on it's own as a great cinematic achievement and should be recognized as more than a sequel,It's a continuation of great epic and all around excellent film."
jace_the_film_guy,"Sep 24, 2022",10/10,"What can I say about ""The Empire Strikes Back"" that hasn't already been said? This film takes everything great about ""A New Hope"" and elevates it. The cinematography, the setting, the characters, the story, everything is crisp and succinct in ""Empire"". There were multiple times (3 to be exact) that I had full body chills, all because of the brilliant marriage of story, score and performance.This movie shows that the ""galaxy far, far away"" is more than just Tatooine and the Death Star. From Hoth to Dagpbah to Cloud City, ""Empire"" helps expand the Star Wars Universe. By traveling to different parts of the galaxy, the film physically separates the three leads. Even though apart, their connection remains strong with the force (and their incredible chemistry) binding them together. Their individual journeys have purpose and the addition of new supporting characters (Yoda, Lando, etc.) are legendary.If this film failed, Star Wars would not be the legendary franchise that it is today. Simply put, ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is top tier cinema.Additional Note: The three ""chill-worthy"" moments were 1. Yoda raising the ship. 2. THE reveal. 3. Realizing the force connection between the siblings."
moronicfables,"Nov 13, 2004",10/10,"Back in the 80's, people were very excited for the release of The Empire Strikes Back, the much-awaited sequel to the phenomenal Star Wars. But, I can imagine, they were also wondering if it would be as good as Star Wars. No, it's not. It's much better. There's more action, the characters become richer and we are introduced to new ones. Thankfully, Lucas backed down in directing and/or writing the film.Considered as the best film among the Trilogy, The Empire Strikes Back starts with the whole gang staying at a Rebel base in the ice planet of Hoth. After almost getting mauled by a Wampa Beast, Luke gets a message from Obi-Wan Kenobi to go to the Planet of Dagobah and look for a Jedi Master named Yoda. The Imperial Army arrives and tries to destroy the base, but the Rebels have already escaped, with Luke accompanied by R2-D2 goes to Dagobah. The Battle of Hoth is easily my favorite action scene in the whole Trilogy.While Han, Leia and Chewbacca are hiding from the Imperial army that's chasing them, Luke meets the 800 year-old Jedi Master Yoda. Full of wisdom and a funny way of talking, Yoda trains Luke to be a real Jedi and teaches him the ways of a Jedi. Almost nothing happens in the middle of the film, except for great character development and lots of intelligent dialogue. It manages to keep us interested and excited without having too many action scenes. We get to know more about all the characters, including the villains and new characters that we are introduced to.We then meet Lando Calrissian who lives in Bespin, a city that floats among the clouds. Lucas hardly touched this masterpiece, but he still added some more striking visuals, most of which aren't unnecessary. More windows are added to the buildings in Bespin, adding lot more light and life to the settings. The visuals added aren't a bother anymore, and for once probably made a scene look better.Han and Leia don't trust Lando, to which we soon find out that they were right about their feelings toward him. Luke forsees that they're in trouble and goes to make sure that they're all right. As Han Solo is about to be frozen, Leia finally admits to Han that she loves her. To which Han replies with, ""I know."" It's an incredibly touching and emotional scene, where things are just about to get worse.As Luke arrives at Bespin, he encounters Darth Vader, to which father and son fight. Quite possibly the best Lightsaber fight in all the Star Wars films, the scene is filled with so much emotion and a shocking revelation. Luke sacrifices his own life rather than join the dark side, and is saved by Leia and Chewbacca, along with Lando, after much threats from Chewy. The film ends on such a downbeat note, keeping a cliffhanger for the final movie in the Trilogy.The characters have yet to face another adventure, and learn more from each other as the Imperial is yet to be beaten and Solo to be rescued. It's not a happy ending, or should I say, a beginning for the characters as what the future holds from them is yet to be known. It shouldn't be a suprrise from anyone that The Empire Strikes Back is considered by many as the best of the Trilogy, because the film is a great stepping-stone for the characters we've grown to love in the first film and introduces us to new ones that we easily grow to love and care for. That's what makes Star Wars a great Trilogy in the first place: it's the characters we remember. Not the visuals.10"
blanbrn,"May 27, 2007",10/10,"Episode V ""The Empire Strikes Back"" released in 1980 in my opinion was a great sequel to the 1977 original. As far as quality it closely ranks to the original, and in terms of character development, and plot and as far as the storytelling goes it's probably better than the 1977 original. Directed this time around by Irvin Kershner he does just as good a job with the sets, characters, and special effects work as Lucas did making it just as good as 1977's. Here the saga now has a setting on the ice planet of Hoth, a place that the Rebels have hid from the evil empire in pursuit, with the real goal they have is to reach the fabulous city of Bespin nicknamed Cloud City for it's airy view. Here's when this installment becomes a real coming of age sequel in which the central character Luke Skywalker comes of age both in terms of skill and mind, and that's when he makes a stop in the swamp of Dagobah. It is in the swamps that hold an important part of the saga and the development of the Skywalker character is found here by training with the appearance of the Jedi master Yoda(hey, nice little green puppet!) as Luke's skill of mind and fighting ability is formed making one reason that Episode V is so important. Later a dark secret is revealed, by Darth Vader in the climax at cloud city, and it was just great to see the fierce battle between Luke and Vader to close out this installment. Overall ""The Empire Strikes Back"" might be the best of the saga in terms of the coming of age development of the central character(Luke). Also the plot finally reveals the hidden truth that's a very dark secret, and the introduction of a new and unique character(Yoda) holds the saga together just great. This really is just as good as the 1977 original simply because more key elements are shown and discovered, the only rule of law is I usually don't rank sequels over the original."
kari-57501,"Dec 29, 2022",10/10,"Empire strikes back is the best star wars movie because it does everything sequel should do. She expands the star wars world and teaches us more about it. There are good actors and George Lucas is the director and writer in this film. In my opinion, this is the best acting star wars movie. She is also so much different from New Hope. When New hope was a happy and bright movie, Empire strikes back was dark and not afraid to do something new and dark. Also this is the first movie that Yoda is in. Special affect in this film is amazing during the 1980s, everything that happens in space is amazing and the practical affect in this film is gg. Yoda is, in my opinion, the best character ever made in movie history. The movie doesn't end on a good note for our protagonists, I think so because then we get a good ending in the next movie."
Michael_Elliott,"Dec 19, 2015",N/A,"The Empire Strikes Back (1980)**** (out of 4)The second film of the original trilogy has the Empire forcing their vengeance as Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) begins his Jedi training with Yoda while Hans Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca and the gang try to get to Darth Vadar.George Lucas directed the original STAR WARS in 1977, which was a tremendous hit with both fans and critics. He basically took a ""B"" movie idea, something you'd see at a Saturday matinée and made it into a high-quality picture. This sequel had Lucas turning the directing duties over to Irvin Kershner and the end result certainly raises it to an ""A"" movie and one that many fans believe is the greatest of the series. I'm not going to lie, I somewhat enjoy the original a tad bit more but that's not to say this is a bad movie. Far from that.What's rather amazing is the fact that the producers, director and screenwriters simply could have given us the same film again but instead they decided to make it much bigger, more darker and I'd argue they really wanted to blow the original out of the water. The film once again benefits from some terrific special effects, a rousing score from John Williams and there's no question that visually the film is a lot more impressive than the original.You've also got the cast back together with both Hamill and Fisher once again delivering the goods but also Billy Dee Williams and Alec Guinness in a bit part. Once again it's Harrison Ford who easily steals the film with his comic timing and just that hero persona that shines through. Plus, it's just magic seeing him and Chewbacca work together.THE EMPIRE STRIKES BACK is considered one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made and it's hard to argue with that."
educallejero,"Jun 15, 2020",7/10,"The worst part of the movie were Chewbacca's excessive and excruciating howlings. That, plus the annoying (although less so) R2-D2 noises made the experience less pleasent for no reason (I guess kids love these things?).But beyond that this movie walked the fine line between childish and ""serious"" in impressive manner. The scripts is way better developing the story, the characters and their relationships, and even connecting all the subplots to the main plot at the end. The dialogue is still not great, but that was to be expected.Plus? We are introduced in much more detail to ""The Force"", expands the Universe to places beyond ""The Rebels"" and ""The Empire"", the score is still awesome and the action gets more diverse and less repetetive (although, it can get a bit boring here and there, it's not even close to the first one). Great sequel in fact."
WalterFrith,"Jan 23, 2005",10/10,"George Lucas' 'Star Wars' trilogy is the greatest fantasy story in all of film history. Yes, even better than the 'Lord of the Rings' trilogy. 'Lord of the Rings' is fine work but the characters aren't as well developed as in 'Star Wars' and they are too long. Also, each 'Star Wars' film stands out better than each 'Lord of the Rings' film. Three chapters in 'Lord of the Rings' is one big movie while 'Star Wars' is a space western, 'The Empire Strikes Back' is a dark, attractive and Gothic work of art and 'Return of the Jedi' is like a Disney film. Each has their own personality. As far as trilogies go altogether, 'The Godfather' films will always be the greatest in movie history'.I love 'The Empire Strikes Back' but I can't go along with the assertion that it is better than 'Star Wars'. I was one of those people that saw 'Star Wars' every weekend for a year when I was 11 and 12 years when a child's admission was only 50 cents to a dollar. There was such a magnificent freshness to 'Star Wars' that audiences couldn't get enough and when adjusted for inflation, 'Star Wars' is the second biggest box office film is history, second only to 1939's 'Gone with the Wind'. Meaning that these two films sold the most tickets in motion picture history.'Star Wars' even created the entire concept of the modern day blockbuster and influenced hundreds of films after it, is the biggest movie in the history of popular culture and created a new religion. A recent poll in Britain asked people to identify their religion and a substantial portion of them wrote in ""Jedi Knight"".'The Empire Strikes Back' does advance the story line forward greatly, has a convincing and blossoming love story between Han Solo and Pricess Leia and gives us the showdown we want. It also introduces us to the legendary Yoda and a new key player in Lando Calrissian and has some breath taking special effects. But 'The Empire Strikes Back' owes its success to 'Star Wars' but has to be given credit for the fact that it teaches people, especially the young, that the good guys don't always win and that the fight for what's right sometimes seems impossible."
hall895,"May 27, 2005",10/10,"One of the rare sequels which manages to surpass the original, The Empire Strikes Back is an all-time classic. A much more personal tale, this film is really all about the journey of young Luke Skywalker. A New Hope followed Skywalker as he became involved in the rebellion against the Galactic Empire. Here the rebellion is put on the back burner. This is less the story of a grand rebellion and more the story of one young man's growth as he continues to fulfill his destiny.We pick up with the rebels in hiding on a secret base on the remote ice world of Hoth. All the familiar figures from last time around are here, including Han Solo, Princess Leia, Chewbacca and the droids R2-D2 and C-3PO. And Luke Skywalker is here as well and it is Skywalker whom Darth Vader seems most interested in finding. Last time out Vader and the Empire were simply interested in wiping out the mostly anonymous rebels. Now, Vader has taken a personal interest in young Skywalker. The movie kicks into high gear as the Empire locates the rebel base and a great battle ensues. The rebels are forced to flee their base and here our heroes go off in different directions.Guided by the spirit of former mentor Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guinness in what is basically a cameo role) Luke Skywalker heads for the distant swampy planet of Dagobah where he is to be trained by the old Jedi master Yoda. Soon to be one of the most beloved characters in the series, Yoda is a 900-year old, two feet tall, green alien creature. The performances of puppeteer Frank Oz as Yoda and Mark Hamill as Skywalker are crucial here. Were the performances lacking audiences might have found it hard to believe these scenes where the young Jedi trainee converses and interacts with the rather odd little creature. But Hamill and Oz pull it off well. On Dagobah Luke (and the audience) learn much about the Force and the ways of the Jedi. In the original film the only Jedi we saw, Obi-Wan Kenobi was a rather mysterious figure. Now some light is shed on exactly who the Jedi are and what is required to become one.While Luke trains on Dagobah, Han Solo and Princess Leia are sidetracked on their journey to meet up with the rest of the rebels. Harrison Ford is terrific again playing Solo as he has the ultra-confident wiseguy role down pat. Carrie Fisher is again strong in the role of Leia, who drops some of the pretense of the last film and begins to give in to her rather obvious feelings for the swashbuckling Solo. Eventually Han and Leia make their way to Cloud City where we are introduced to another new character in the saga, Han's old friend Lando Calrissian. Han and Leia don't quite trust Lando and it soon becomes apparent that things in Cloud City are not quite what they seem. Sensing his friends are in danger Luke Skywalker leaves Dagobah to attempt to rescue them.Skywalker arrives in Cloud City to meet his destiny. Han, Leia and the rest of the characters fade into the background as the climax, much as the entire film, will be all about Luke Skywalker. Where the original Star Wars ended with an epic space battle, here everything leads up to a thrilling one-on-one showdown capped by one of the most jaw-dropping revelations ever seen in film.Some will say the ending of The Empire Strikes Back leaves the audience hanging. It is true there is not a clearly defined traditional ending as in the original film. But the ending here is powerful in its own way. It leaves you in great suspense, eagerly awaiting the inevitable conclusion to the saga. The film is not truly self-contained, it requires the knowledge of what has come before and the expectation of what will come after. It is by not going for the easy Hollywood ending that The Empire Strikes Back truly triumphs.Taken on its own merits The Empire Strikes Back can be said to even surpass the original Star Wars. The acting performances are again first-rate. Yoda is a fascinating and thoroughly enjoyable new character. In playing Lando Calrissian, Billy Dee Williams gives us someone well worth rooting for. Or against, we're not quite sure. The John Williams score, including the famed spine-chilling Imperial March, is magnificent. The visuals are dazzling, as would be expected. And most importantly we have a truly great story. The Empire Strikes Back, much more so than A New Hope, is Luke Skywalker's movie. It is fascinating to watch his journey as he moves towards fulfilling his ultimate destiny."
arthurclay,"Jun 8, 2005",10/10,"And damn if it didn't deliver the goods and a helluvalot more. It is so dark in theme it almost enters horror flick territory and that is brilliance in and of itself to go from one extreme to the other so fluidly and poetically. It worked in a way that The Temple of Doom just didn't with moviegoers. I suppose that was due in part to the cool suspenseful plot developments, particularly Yoda, Han and Leia's budding romance, but largely due to the Earth-shattering ""the world is not flat it's round"" surprise ending. I would bet when George Lucas wrote that scene down on paper he must have been either laughing maniacally and saying ""Nobody could ever have seen that coming in two billion light years!"" or crying with joy all the while with the one idea that ""This will be so golden that it will be remembered til the end of time and even after that."" As Hamill said so eloquently, ""In the Empire Strikes Back, everyone has problems. Luke has problems, Leia has problems, they turned Han into a coffee table!"" I must also include Silent Bob's quote ""She says 'I love you.' and like a pimp he says 'I know'."" It was the equivalent of dropping burning napalm on the audience. They must have been more stunned than people leaving the theaters after seeing the Exorcist for the first time. It was pure 100% movie magic and worthy of the original in every aspect."

nattawatkorn,"May 28, 2018",7/10,"In my opinion, The Empire Strikes Back is Star Wars at its best and is a groundbreaking movie and a near perfect sequel. It is very enjoyable to watch but is also incredibly overrated. The Empire Strikes is no where near perfection and definitely not the best film ever made like many people said. Although, I do agree that this is George Lucas Masterpiece.7.4/10"
EijiroKirishima1016,"Dec 12, 2024",10/10,"In a sea of derivative sequels, The Empire Strikes Back stands out due to its dark tone and the stakes of the story. The empire's ruthlessness contributes to this oppressive tone, to the point where there is little to no hope for our heroes to escape this peril. The twist at the end of this film, as I'm sure everyone knows at this point, is not just shocking for the sake of being a twist; it allows discussion on the grey area between the extremes of good and evil. The new musical themes introduced in this film are incredibles, especially ""Imperial March."" Once again, the effects are phenomenal for their time and still hold up tremendously, particularly the AT-ATs. Overall, I slightly prefer the first film, but I don't think anyone would argue that this is one of the greatest sequels in cinematic history."

An iconic masterpiece of pure escapism filled with thrills and fun.
deepfrieddodo,"Apr 24, 2023",10/10,"Arguably the best film from the original trilogy (and entire Star Wars saga), The Empire Strikes Back strikes a more mature tone than it's predecessor; still fantastical and exploring a labyrinth of imagination that you could get lost in, but delving deeper into the mysticism of the force and division between good and evil.Some of the most famous quotes and scenes in cinema history are found within these two hours, influential and replicated or parodied countless times. It's difficult to find someone not aware of the film's 'twist', even if they haven't seen the film, and that cultural impact shows what a behemoth this film is. The storytelling takes an almighty step forward with these plot points, keeping the story engrossing and well paced.Empire sees the introduction of some of the most recognisable characters in media; fan favourites who's mannerisms and qualities endure beyond the film. Without losing any of the core characters from A New Hope, these new characters are integrated well, having meaningful contributions to the story and wider context, without overwhelming screentime.Relationships develop tenfold, creating more chemistry between all the characters, new and old. Whilst more apparent arcs of friendship, romance, and betrayal flourish, smaller interactions between less noticeable relationships show the evolution off screen - such as Chewbacca and C3PO. Leia in particular is given the opportunity to stamp her personality in the film, even more so than previously - an excellent character leading the way instead of falling into the royal category of damsel in distress.Once again, the settings as magnificent, none more so than the original locations in the likes of Hoth and Dagobah. Cloud CIty benefits from Lucas' later edits, but these built sets create such an atmosphere. These are supported by the costuming, props and puppetry, which are as iconic as the heroes utilising them.The soundtrack is still excellent and transitions the story between scenes so well. Overall, the whole film is a little more seamless, and it is the perfect film building upon an unbeatable foundation."

Incredible special effects and soundtrack, especially for 1980 year.All in all, 5th episode of Star Wars is must-see, like all trilogy.

Zavisin,"May 16, 2016",10/10,"I really loved all star wars movies. I must say that music is excellent and that Dart wader theme is just great. The Cloud City, the most awesome of any of the Star Wars arenas, is a beautiful exterior with a dark heart. The film culminates in a whirl of emotional intensity and the infernal machine of the carbon freezing chamber. With John Williams' breathtaking score and the dark red hellish lighting, the whole feel is of a Wagnerian opera: dark and epic.Magnificently visualized, the dizzying vertiginous terror of the moment encapsulating Luke's disorientation and horror at Vader's revelation of paternalism."
byronyale,"Jan 3, 2006",N/A,"Out with Clive Revile and in with Ian McDiarmid. George Lucas has once again retouched this movie, but with little fanfare this time. In the new Star Wars Trilogy DVD 3 pack, (episodes 4,5, and 6) The scene with Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine has been redone. Clive Revile has been entirely cut out, and an improved holographic projection of Ian has been added along with expanded dialog. And I have to say this is probably the only scene George added to the original trilogy that actually made the movie better. But I think George could take a lesson from the great painting artists, the painting always looks the best when incomplete, otherwise it has no ability to stimulate our imagination."
chera_khalid,"Oct 2, 2023",7/10,"The Empire Strikes Back, a vintage jewel in the Star Wars galaxy that had me navigating the asteroid field of nostalgia with a grin. The acting, led by the charismatic trio of Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, and Carrie Fisher, is a lightsaber duel of emotions. Film editing propels the narrative at lightspeed, seamlessly transitioning between Hoth's icy plains and the swamps of Dagobah. The strength lies in the darker, more mature tone, expanding the saga beyond the binary of good and evil. Weaknesses? The romantic subplot might be as clunky as C-3PO on an Ewok dance floor, but it's a minor quibble in the grand scheme. The music, John Williams' masterpiece, is the Force that binds the scenes together, from the Imperial March to Yoda's Theme. Cinematography captures the vastness of space and the intimacy of lightsaber duels, creating a visual odyssey through the galaxy. The message? A tale of loss, redemption, and the resilience of hope in the face of Imperial tyranny. 7/10 is a blast from the past that still holds its intergalactic charm, a Star Wars episode that's both iconic and imperfect, like an old friend you're happy to revisit."

PCC0921,"Jun 13, 2022",9/10,"Before the release of Star Wars (1977], in the theaters, it still had to go through the same steps as any other movie. It too was considered a one shot deal, just like any other movie. It too, like every other film, had to pass the big test at the box office first, before anything else could happen. As everyone knows, this George Lucas directed film, was a huge box office smash, becoming the highest grossing movie of all time. It still held the record in 1980, thus giving the green-light for Lucas to develop a trilogy of films. What makes Empire Strikes Back (1980), so good, is the fact that, the film is one of those bridge-films. It bridges the gap from the first film to the third film. Some number two films in a trilogy, are susceptible to taxing pacing, caused by the need to be a set-up for the big finale in the third film. If done correctly, the film can be a successful bridge-film, while still completing its goal of being an exciting entry in the trilogy. This film accomplishes the goal of being an exciting adventure, full of maturing characters and it comes with a more darker side to it. It also successfully bridges the gap to the third film, Return of the Jedi (1983). It creates major implications for the main cast of characters. It is a cliff-hanger of a story.George Lucas stepped aside as the director for this film, for director Irvin Kershner. Kershner creates a slick, exciting, action-packed adventure, full of dazzle, flare and artistry. It has one of the most incredible soundtracks ever, thanks to legendary composer John Williams. It is pure pleasure watching this film. It is the stuff of legends now. It is still hailed as being the best Star Wars movie ever. The film starts with the main cast together, but splits them up into two stories, that carries the film to the end, eventually bringing them together again, but with a price. The first sub-plot involves Luke (Mark Hamill), meeting the Muppet-like, Jedi master, Yoda (Frank Oz), who begins training Luke to be a Jedi. The other sub-plot involves Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), being chased by Darth Vader (Peter Mayhew/James Earl Jones) and enlisting the aid of Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams), the leader of Cloud City. The stage is set for one of the biggest cliff-hangers in film history.9.3 (A Mygrade) = 9 IMDB."
LigerTamer100,"Dec 28, 2020",10/10,"Forty years ago, in a galaxy far away. A sequel of the movie that changed cinema forever was made, and it sure as heck didn't failed on anyone.Every top best sequels I see always has Empire Strikes Back on the number one spot, and there's a reason why. It took many dark turns that nobody at the time saw coming, it didn't use the same elements that the previous movie used and it felt like we were exploring the galaxy a lot more than we did in the last film.If I have to pick where to put this on my Star Wars rank list, it'd be on the top three, just not sure where in the three spots.The romance part of the film works really well with Leia and Han. Sure, the age gap between Carrie and Harrison was a bit awkward, but they somehow made it work great for the franchise and became one of the best couples ever.The reveal of Vader being the father wasn't a surprise to me when I first watched it, because I started watching the franchise with the prequels first in 2006 and knew what was happening.And I know this is going to cause a debate, but I think Yoda is a Muppet. It's not because of Frank Oz performing him, but it's because he feels like one to me. I feel like the Jim Henson company helped a little bit making him and there was an episode of Muppet Show where Luke, Chewie, R2 and 3PO was in and to me, that was a deal that Lucas and Henson made as a fair enough collab as a team. There's even some behind the scenes pictures that Jim, Kermit and Piggy were in. Think about that for a few minutes.This is without a doubt, one of the best sequels that was ever made and will always be forever. The force has always been strong with the franchise and fandom, and will forever more."
Nirgaul,"Jul 11, 2005",N/A,"I usually watch this show every two years to keep a fresh perspective on it. This is the first real film experience I ever had, and it remains the strongest influence on me. The thing that amazes me about this, time and again, is the ingenuity of the pacing, the orchestration, and the motion of the vehicles and ships.This is a triumph of editing.The motion control work is so artfully done, it puts CGI to shame. Watch how the ships move. They dance alongside the camera, swooping toward and away from us. Look at the terrain whiz by in the snowspeeder search. No CGI can convince like that. This is basically helicopter footage on fast-forward, through the cockpit of a prop ship, but it works. The amount of activity going on screen at any given time is frenetic.And then we have Frank Oz. Forget that we live in a world where there are Yoda pajamas, animal crackers, dolls, etc., and just focus on this wonderful character in this one film. He is more lifelike than many of the actors we have working today. When he is on screen, I believe he exists. That is pure movie magic. Mark Hamill is given a tough job with this. Whenever you have a multi-million dollar film that hinges on the performance of one person and a sock puppet, there's pressure. People have blasted him for years over his acting, but it works. He pulls his share of the work and sells every scene.From the opening crawl onward, this never lets up. The music is simply beautiful. This is why I go to the movies."
ogyuak,"Oct 15, 2022",2/10,"I think I just found the most overrated movie in mankind's history.It's totally a mystery how grown up people can enjoy Star Wars. I think it just comes from nostalgia.When I criticize this movie, for example, ""the plot was so simple and stupid"" or "" the creatures were created in a very unrealistic and ridiculous way,"" they always say to me, ""c'mon, it's a movie for children.""
But if this is a children's movie, why you guys are so triggered when someone doesn't like this movie? Deep down, you all know that this movie is totally crap, but just can't admit it to yourselves.By the way, I have to say that Chewbacca's voice is the most irritating voice I've ever heard. It literally raped my ears for 2 hours long."
paulbaloukas90,"Jul 24, 2025",10/10,"This film is another great Star Wars film in the franchise. It's got the most shocking scene in film history which is Darth Vader telling Luke that he's his father. Actors like Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, David Prowse, James Earl Jones (voice), Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, Frank Oz, Alec Guinness etc as Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, Leia Organa, Darth Vader, Lando Calrissian, C3PO, Yoda, Obi Wan ""Ben"" Kenobi etc were amazing. I love the Lightsaber duel between Luke & Vader."
armandobarlick,"Feb 20, 2021",10/10,"This film is so great. It works on so many levels and the best sequel of all time. Who doesn't love this movie if is well shot, great characters and everything is just 10 times better than the original. Star Wars is still to this day one of the greatest films ever made and I didn't think it could get better. I was wrong."
WaltuhRed,"Sep 20, 2021",10/10,"The best Star Wars film in the saga no doubt and the greatest Sci-fi movie ever. This movie is absolutely legendary. Brilliant cinematography (the framing is flawless), great special effects and sound, unforgettable scenes, an outstanding score, some of the most iconic characters in movie history which are really allowed to develop in this film, the best and the most shocking plot twist in cinema history and an amazing storyline.The Empire Strikes Back is the definitive sci-fi movie and arguably the greatest achievements in cinema history. The Empire Strikes Back is
my favourite movie of all time.10/10."
ma-cortes,"May 11, 2023",9/10,"A stunning and fascinating fantasy tale in which some valiant heroes battle the Galactic Empire and they prepare to fight the evil Darth Vader and the forces of the Dark Side .¨The Empire strikes again"" is a timeless classic competently directed by Irvin Keshner , considered to be the best of the exciting trilogy . Riveting second entry George Lucas's Stars Wars from a fantastic trilogy proved to be one of the biggest boxoffice successes of all time . This super-colossal Sci-Fi epic , it is a real and spectacular pantomime . And , like most pantomimes , it is a lot of fun and extremely entertaining . Concerning the young heroe named Luke : Mark Hamill , a hot-shot, cocky aircraft pilot, Han Solo, the previously captured and rescued Princess Leia and a mysterious Jedi Knight, Ben Obi Wan Kenobi , all of them blend together against the tyrants of the Galactic Empire . After destruction of the Rebel base on icy Hoth , Han Solo , Princess Leia and Chewbacca escape in the Millennium Falcon , eventually finding dubious sanctuary in the city of Bespin. Along the way , Luke learns the ways of a Jedi knight from master Yoda : Frank Oz , while Han : Harrison Ford , Leia : Carrie Fisher find time for romance and a few adventures of their own . As the brave team attempting to save the galaxy from the Empire's World by trying to destroy the enemy armada , while Han Solo is captured by the ominous enemy , Darth Vader : David Prowse and his Stormtroopers.

Offers the same superb special effects and hearty plot as set by 1977's magnificent Star Wars. Set a new cinematic standard for realistic but at the same time traditional special effects, including overwhelming battles , impressive monsters , groundbreaking aerial scenes galore , though subsequently several frames were digitalized by I. L. M. (Industrial , Light and Magic) , making many pre-Stars Wars flicks seem almost laughable in retrospective.Writer/producer/filmmaker George Lucas and director Irvin Kershner mixed the best of vintage Science Fiction of the Fifties , pulp literature, old-fashionable cliff-hungers , comic books, Akira Kurosawa films and classic fantasy to come up with the ultimate and overwhelming adventure . It displays wonderful settings, glamorous production design by Michael Ford , monumental art direction by Norman Reynolds and splendid costumes by John Mollo . As well as colorful and brilliant cinematography by Peter Suschitzky. And a vibrant and rousing musical score by the great John Williams, including the classic leitmotif . The movie's adrenaline-raising drive makes it irresistible. Being essential and indispensable watching it . Followed by the inferior ""Return of the Jedi"" by Richard Marquand with similar artistic and technician team."
judemcrobbie,"Feb 1, 2021",10/10,"The cultural and technological significance of The Empire Strikes Back speaks for itself. It revolutionised CGI and practical effects to a whole new level.
The characters are so good, no wonder why they're so iconic. Everything points to the director having an idea of the characters created: Yoda's monologue about the force is so beautiful, it embodies the love Yoda has for it. And Han Solo's ""I know"" is so to character, keeping that arrogant and boastful persona as he would.
The use of the force is the epitome of subtlety as it creates this beautiful living organism.
It's a cinematic masterpiece: where the CGI might not hold up today, the cinematography certainly does, clearly inspiring movies to come.
Obviously it's one of the greatest action movies, let alone movies in total.
For some reason I prefer A New Hope"
JamesHunt18,"Jul 22, 2020",10/10,"First of all, this is not just my all-time favourite sequel but my all-time favourite film. It thoroughly deserves that title because I consider it nothing less than a masterpiece. It takes everything great about the original and simply improves on it, a task many would've seemed to be impossible.With Irvin Kershner taking the reigns of director, from George Lucas, the film goes into a not necessarily darker tone but more mature. With A New Hope being a more light-hearted, but no less iconic, space opera this change puts more focus on the emotions of the characters we have met and, in turn, raises the stakes for heroes, especially Luke who must now face his foe.Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher and Mark Hamill maintain the effortless portrayal of their respective characters from the first film. The introduction of Billy Dee Williams as Lando is simply brilliant as he too fully embodies his role and bounces off Harrison Ford's Han Solo. Another introduction is that of Yoda (operated by Frank Oz) that adds to the mystery of 'The Jedi' and 'The Force' as this character is just overloaded with so much wisdom and is used so well to build Luke's character throughout the film.'Empire' contains possibly one of the most memorable line's in of all cinema; those who have seen this know exactly what I mean. However, it far from relies on this moment as there are a countless number of iconic moments and dialogue.The visual effects of the 1977 release of Star Wars may have been ground-breaking but this film shows how far the industry has come in 3 years. Whether this be the representation of Cloud City, the Walker Assault or even as simple as shots of the Falcon flying. These may seem easy enough to manufacture in 2020 but must have been incredible to see in 1980. I am simply gutted I wasn't able to experience that wonder myself.John Williams again excels at what he does. He is extra-ordinarily consistent in his quality, and not just in this franchise. He truly sends these films into the history books and is one of the many reasons Star Wars, Empire especially, is still so loved today.Empire Strikes Back is truly the heart of this trilogy and is unquestionable in its quality. The Story is unforgettable and the film-making is sublime. I only have two words for those involved in its production: Thank You!"
pdtrovao,"May 24, 2024",10/10,"""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the epic sequel to the film ""Star Wars"", everything in this film improves what was already incredible: The direction, photography, dialogue, special effects, etc. Each frame of this film can be placed in a painting in an art museum, Irvin Kershner does a surreal job. The film follows the conflicts of the Rebel Alliance against the Galactic Empire after the destruction of the Death Star, while Han Solo and Leia flee the Empire, Luke goes to a distant planet to be trained by an ancient Jedi master. Like I said, it's no exaggeration that this film is one of the best sequels of all time, it deserves all the awards it won."
s_daad,"Oct 17, 2010",1/10,"This film is bad in the sense that it is hardly a film at all. It has no structure, no dialogue, no screenplay, a threadbare story, but one that is not told because of non-existent direction, etc. It continues where the original left off, and just notches off plot elements one by one without any urge to tell a story, or develop characters, relationships, etc. The makers probably conceived this as a filler between numbers one and three and didn't bother with it. Of course, that's all right. I don't have any problem with that. But what really does disturb me is the high praise meted out to this ""film"" from almost every quarter – from viewers and critics alike. On this board it's being rated as the 17th best movie of all time. I've consulted quite a few film guides, and they all tag maximum, or near maximum, stars to this film. Even more bizarrely, they consider it to be the best of the series, and in my mind it's clearly the worst. What is going on? Of course, it's not difficult to see why this film is idolized. The first film was both good and a milestone. Not great, but it was the perfect statement for an age. It was a fairy tale that was confused as science fiction. The ""Force"" embodied morality, even religion, for the space age. It is set in the distant past and therefore pertains to origins rather than where technology is going. Spaceships and laser guns are just the backdrop, and have nothing to do with the story or the subject matter. When this film appeared in the middle of the crisis-ridden seventies, it really must have been a beacon of ""new hope"". And to put the ground-breaking special effects into its proper context, they symbolized optimism. There is no doubt that the effects served the story well, but they served even better the mood of the age. And with all this going, Star Wars rightly became a tremendous hit, and the focus of fanatic devotion. It was to be expected that any sequel would have been gobbled up by the fan base, as long as it didn't spoil the original. Empire doesn't spoil the original. It not only continues the war between good and evil, it does so with more spectacle, more aplomb, more special effects.When people say they like Empire, what I think they really mean is that thy like Star Wars so much that they are thrilled that it has a new and glossy wrapping. Because Empire is nothing but embellishment. They're not judging the film itself. The ideal situation would have been if Star Wars remained as a standalone fairy tale. Fairy tales end, and they leave us with the aura of ""happily ever after"". They don't go on and on and become sagas, and if they did that would totally destroy the aura. Empire is the first mistaken step towards saga, and that is why it quickly finds itself out of its depth. There is nothing else to be told, and that's why the film is so bad. One boring battle joined to another boring battle, and in between we have cardboard characters mouthing atrocious dialogue that serves no purpose whatsoever. The strain tells. Everybody is straining to do something when there is nothing to do. The third film, The Return of the Jedi, redeems itself by trying to finish a story. The prequels are interesting because they are filling in the background. But Empire is caught in no man's land. It is bad, and it should be exposed as such. All this pretending isn't healthy, I don't think."
maximumegaming,"Dec 10, 2021",10/10,I love this movie so incredibly much it's so nostalgic for me watching it as a kid but even excluding that this movie is an apsalute gem giving us tonnes of memorable characters and lines that have been so iconic. The movie is iconic with sets and props that have inspired to many other science fiction movies and movies in general for years to come.
LanternSwapnil,"Nov 30, 2019",10/10,"Epiaode IV - A New Hope is 10 out of 10. Certainly, I would love to give Episode V more than 10. This is great movie with great twists and turns. This is everything a classic should be.Luke v Vader... this was awaited most certainly and I loved the portrayed and the conclusion of this fight. Empire really striking back and even nice men are foeced to betray their friends.From beginning til end the whole concept of story grips you tightly and sharp turns on this journey gives the varieties of emotions. Simply a movie to remember and to talk and encourage others to watch. Gold."
mardiblaise,"Dec 16, 2020",10/10,I love this. I first saw it when I was little. It is still great.
mikayakatnt,"Feb 20, 2020",10/10,"My hands-down favorite of the original Star Wars trilogy. The dark side has started seeking their revenge after the destruction of the Death Star and Luke trains to become the Jedi master that his father once was.Enjoyed the higher budget compared to the first Star Wars movie and how the Empire actually wins a few battles this time. Makes the whole ""galactic war"" seem more real.5/5. I'm sure the other fanboys have more extensive movie reviews for those who are interested."
chungethan,"Mar 31, 2022",10/10,"After watching this film for the 5th time, there is not much to say about this movie that hasn't already been said. It's simply just a terrific movie. The story, acting and almost everything is at a near perfect level."
MFC9,"Nov 25, 2021",10/10,"The gold standard of Star Wars films, Empire outdoes ANH on every level with a deeper look at the characters, superior acting, special effects and story. The only film in the franchise without a giant finale, Empire transcended blockbuster movie making with Irvin Kerschner showing George how these movies should be done. The Michael Jordan of Star Wars. 10/10."
TJ_at_the_drive_in,"Dec 20, 2025",10/10,For me personally it's my favorite. A new hope sets the ground floor for this one to put the pedal to the metal. Episode 4 is a close second. It's hard not to absolutely love a new hope the most but the iconic ending to this movie is so in fact iconic and so popular that people who haven't even watched it know the lines and know the plot twist. Since I can remember I've known the plot twist and I wish I could've been in the theater getting my mind blown because we are told that his father is did so why would you question that and assume that was his father? Anyway the acting and story are great it looks great everything is perfect and it's a science fiction masterpiece.
ethandragonfire,"Oct 7, 2024",7/10,"From the very beginning, The Empire Strikes Back sets itself apart with a darker tone. The opening scenes on Hoth, where the Rebels are on the run from the Empire, immediately immerse viewers in the high stakes of the war. The film quickly establishes that this isn't a mere adventure anymore; it's a survival story. The battle on the icy planet feels like a frantic last stand for the Rebels, contrasting with the optimism of the victory at the end of A New Hope. Yet despite the tension, the movie maintains a fast pace, pulling viewers from one intense moment to the next without overwhelming them.One of the standout elements is how the film handles its characters. In The Empire Strikes Back, we see significant development for Luke Skywalker, Han Solo, and Leia Organa. Luke, in particular, begins his journey from a hopeful young hero to a more mature, conflicted."
kevdoggy,"Apr 25, 2002",3/10,"The 17th best film of all time?  Maybe if you're 13.  This is a nice little adventure story, and quite frankly, if you think this is a great film, your nerd is showing.It's good, but I'm giving it a 3 just to balance out all the idiots, and there's 24,000 of them, that gave it a 10.  Get a life, people, or at least a girlfriend.It's actually more like a 6 or 7.George Lucas makes nice action figures."
svgvqw,"May 28, 2023",10/10,"In a galaxy far, far away, there exists a cinematic gem that has stood the test of time, capturing the hearts and minds of fans across generations. I am referring to none other than ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back."" Words alone cannot express the sheer brilliance and captivating nature of this film, but I shall endeavor to do justice to its incredible impact.From the very moment the iconic opening crawl graces the screen, accompanied by John Williams' majestic score, you are transported into an unparalleled universe filled with rich storytelling and unforgettable characters. Director Irvin Kershner masterfully expands upon the foundation laid by its predecessor, delivering a film that sets the gold standard for sci-fi fantasy adventures.First and foremost, the character development in ""The Empire Strikes Back"" is nothing short of extraordinary. We witness the growth and transformation of our beloved heroes, as well as the introduction of new faces who have become indelible figures in popular culture. Luke Skywalker's journey toward becoming a Jedi Knight is rife with inner conflict and self-discovery, a testament to Mark Hamill's exceptional acting prowess.The character dynamics are also expertly woven together. The unforgettable banter between Han Solo and Princess Leia provides a delightful mixture of wit, charm, and undeniable chemistry. Their captivating romance adds an extra layer of depth and emotion to the film, allowing viewers to become fully invested in their captivating love story.One cannot discuss ""The Empire Strikes Back"" without mentioning the iconic and menacing presence of Darth Vader. Portrayed by the legendary David Prowse and voiced by the iconic James Earl Jones, Vader transcends the realm of villains, becoming an archetype for the ages. His powerful presence and the revelation that shocks audiences to this day have forever solidified him as one of cinema's greatest antagonists.The film's technical achievements are breathtaking. The groundbreaking visual effects and stunning set designs transport us to the frozen planet of Hoth, the lush swamps of Dagobah, and the magnificent Cloud City of Bespin. The Battle of Hoth alone is a masterpiece, showcasing the epic scope of the Star Wars universe and leaving audiences in awe of its grandeur.Furthermore, the film's screenplay, penned by the legendary Lawrence Kasdan and Leigh Brackett, is a triumph. It seamlessly combines moments of intense action with deep emotional resonance. From Yoda's wise teachings to the dramatic revelation on Cloud City, the script expertly balances light and dark, creating a narrative that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout.Of course, the score composed by John Williams deserves a standing ovation. It elevates every scene, stirring emotions and building suspense with its iconic themes. The Imperial March, which made its debut in this film, has become synonymous with the power and might of the Empire and is instantly recognizable to fans worldwide.""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is a monumental achievement in filmmaking, setting a standard that many have aspired to but few have reached. Its influence on popular culture is immeasurable, and its impact on the art of storytelling is undeniable. Even after all these years, it continues to captivate and inspire new generations, cementing its status as one of the greatest films ever made.In conclusion, ""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is a masterpiece in every sense of the word.

Xarx117,"Jul 1, 2022",9/10,"This movie is really good, obviously the best star wars movie. But it would not be has good has it is if the other star wars movies did not exist. Star Wars episode 4 helped a lot by introducing the characters and the universe. The drama is great, the acting was ok, the character developement is awsome, the fight scenes are ok and the rest is really well done. For sure Star Wars episode 4 was essential to the sucess of this film, but it still has to be recognized for how good it is."

MonkeyMan152,"Oct 22, 2021",10/10,"Empire strikes back is amazing with great characters,an amazing plot twist,and a film that serves as a good middle chapter to the original trilogy. And by the way what character does big bank hank compare himself to?"

cruise01,"May 8, 2020",10/10,(5 out of 5 stars).Great second movie in the trilogy. Darker. The opening battle on a snowy planet was awesome. The lightsaber battle with Vader and Luke was great. Plus a twist. The script and direction is great. The cast is great.

Tweetienator,"Feb 15, 2022",9/10,"Every time I revisit the good old first trilogy I wonder: did Georg Lucas spend all this creativity on the first three movies or did he have some ghost writer or maybe he got the story dictated by a supernatural being? Without any doubt, those three first movies of the ST franchise are still and maybe for all eternity gems and milestones to the sci-fi genre, but almost everything else that was produced and published after Return of the Jedi is in comparison bad, really bad, with a very few exceptions (Rogue One was good). But maybe the saying even a blind hen sometimes finds a grain of corn just fits too well to Mr. Lucas. Anyway, he gave us these three epic movies, and for these treasures I am grateful in all eternity, and the rest I can just ignore. Amen."
suvechhabose,"Sep 19, 2019",10/10,"It will forever stay classic.
Generation after generation,it will."
Greg Sanderson,"Oct 22, 2001",10/10,"In creating a sequel to the phenomenally successful Star Wars, George Lucas and his team were faced with a seemingly impossible challenge.  How could the original be surpassed?  Three years (and a lot of cash) had, of course, given the film-makers the opportunity to develop the special effects technology far beyond the original film.  But this alone was not enough. Where Empire truly excels over it's predecessor is in the two essential fields of film storytelling-- both the plot and the characters are far richer and more captivating.  Why is Empire the greatest film ever made? We will never again see such a perfect blending of romance, adventure, emotion and movie magic."

A gem. 10 out of 10."
dalicath,"Oct 24, 2024",10/10,"As a Star Wars fan myself, The Empire Strikes Back is the epitome of everything that makes this saga a 10/10 experience. From its deep character development to its darker, more mature storytelling, this film delivers on every level.The continuation of Luke Skywalker's journey is gripping, particularly his intense training with Yoda, which adds philosophical depth to the Force. The film's heart-wrenching revelation about Darth Vader's identity is perhaps one of the most iconic moments in cinema history, still sending chills down my spine even after multiple viewings.The visual effects, especially the battle on Hoth and the cloud city of Bespin, were groundbreaking at the time and still hold up remarkably well today. Combined with John Williams' unforgettable score, these scenes create an immersive cinematic experience that leaves you in awe of the galaxy far, far away.In addition to its technical brilliance, what truly elevates The Empire Strikes Back is its willingness to take risks. The film does not shy away from portraying the Rebellion's losses or leaving audiences with a cliffhanger that feels genuinely emotional and compelling. It's a story of hope amidst despair, which is why it resonates so deeply.For me, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece. It captures the essence of Star Wars while pushing the boundaries of what a science fiction epic can be. It's a must-watch that earns a 10/10 rating every time."
Jeeps,"Jan 3, 1999",N/A,"Undoubtedly, by movie standards, ESB is the best of the trilogy. Unlike Starwars and Jedi, Empire is a profoundly mystical experience, dark and gloomy yet still part of the Trilogy. The first movie was absurdly simple and cheery - especially the end; the third movie would be fairly cheery and slightly slow. Empire is just at the right timbre for a good movie, as well as having what is currently the greatest movie soundtrack of all, according to my sources. All in all, a good movie and quite an experience."
tagerjd,"Jul 24, 2016",6/10,"Star Wars Episode 5 The Empire Strikes Back tells the story of the evil galactic empire attacking the hopeless rebellion after the destruction of the Death Star. One thing that I feel is worth noting right off the bat is that I don't think this film surpasses A New Hope but is ratter on the same level in terms of substance as well as quality.What makes this film good is that it is able to keep its focus on the characters in a universe that is so interesting as well as vast. That is something that makes the original trilogy better in my opinion because in the prequels it was focused on showing us heavily C.G.I. visuals ratter then on the characters. This is one of many factors that make the original trilogy by far the superior films. The plot is also more complex then the first of this trilogy which shows that the people involved with this project were taking risks. The characters were all likable and interesting. And the fact that they filmed at real locations shows dedication from the director Irvin Kershner.The cons of this picture though are not minimal which leads me to feeling as though it is grossly overrated. The acting and dialogue is still hooky, the effects are showing age, the action is underwhelming, and unfortunately the fan base that surrounds Star Wars has made it difficult to watch Empire as it was intended. The story although complex is occasionally driven forward by plot convinces. And although I did not see this infamous twist coming, I also was not all that wowed.In conclusion The Empire Strikes Back is complex and has relatable characters which is able to drive this picture forward as well as be entertaining. And I'm giving this one a 6/10."
claszdsburrogato,"Oct 28, 2023",9/10,"Perhaps this is the favorite film in the franchise for most audiences and that makes perfect sense. The film is a spectacle. From start to finish, its rhythm is wonderful and it becomes more and more fun. Every moment is epic and memorable. The soundtrack is very well used and the sound effects are as striking as the soundtrack. The characters are incredible, from new ones to those already introduced in the last film. The plot twist is perfect and has gone down in cinema history. This film was not directed by George Lucas, which makes it much better. The visual effects are beautiful and are still impressive today, even if some scenes haven't aged so well. This film is very fun and the action is wonderful, a film that I would recommend to everyone who loves science fiction."
why_so_cereal1,"Nov 13, 2013",10/10,"The best Star wars movie ever! Great story, Great acting and Great action. Even the music in this film was amazing. Usually when a great film comes out the sequel sucks. Not in this case. The Empire Strikes Back did not follow the crappy sequel line. The reason it might be so good is because George Lucas did not direct it. The only problem I have is the ending. Why is Lando Wearing Hans clothes? does Han have a closet full of the same clothes that fit Lando? who knows... The Empire Strikes back is a film that you can watch over and over and never get bored. I have seen this film over 100 times and I still love watching it."

Bradthehobbit5,"Oct 11, 2024",10/10,"While I do think that this is one of the most overrated Star Wars films, it is still incredible. There is a reason sequels are compared to this movie. Besides Two Towers and maybe The Dark Knight this is probably the best sequel. It takes all the characters and adds so much depth to them. Also some of the most iconic Star Wars heck movie characters are introduced in this movie. Yoda The Emporer. All introduced in this movie. This is a staple for cinema and has been since it realsed. This also has one of the best movie twists in all of movie history. And this movie took risks. This is one of the first movies we're the heros don't entirely win. This is a good movie."" I love you, I know"""
filipemanuelneto,"May 29, 2016",10/10,"This film is the continuation of the story of the first. The war between the rebels and the Empire continues, while Darth Vader Luke demand throughout the galaxy. Directed by Irvin Kershner and written by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan, this film has the participation of the same actors from the first film.The film inherits most of the qualities of his predecessor. It has a carefully chosen cast and consistent performances, with some emphasis on the work of Harrison Ford, actor who was already highlighted in the first film and now consolidates his success. Action scenes are excellent, thought of meticulous way and the fight scenes with lightsaber remind us some great duels of piracy and swashbuckling films. The special visual and sound effects are the best that existed at the time and fulfill their role with great merit. The only difference between this film and the latest films of the saga is, in fact, this technical issue, given the huge advance that, in a few decades, the techniques and special effects achieved. The soundtrack was again in charge of John Williams, which continues the excellent work started in the first film of the saga. In fact, the first main theme of the chords of the saga became one of the songs that instinctively comes to mind of people when they think of film music, the same way as the ""March of Darth Vader"" has become one of most songs instinctively associated with the image of any movie villain. The point of greatest merit of this movie is the script. It is a deeper script, more psychological and intense than the script of the first film, and this contributed decisively to the success of it, and the franchise itself. Oscar winner for Best Sound, is one of the most popular films of the saga in the present day."
ThePeepingRabbit,"Oct 9, 2022",10/10,"When you talk about sequels that don't suck this is one of them. The 2nd movie to the original Star Wars trilogy was always my go to and most watch over the original movie.This film takes off right after the original and this movie have great acting, music, special effects and twist that still shock you. TESB is truly one of the rare films that could say is too Perfect. Love the battle scenes and the fight with Luke and Darth Vader. Especially we got Yoda training Luke to become a Jedi. Most of all no Comedy that gets in the way is all serious story and to the point.My part is the start to."
bhernandez2216,"Nov 19, 2019",10/10,"""Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back"" is an incredible sequel of all time, it had epic moments, perfect lightsaber duel, shocking twist and every that Star Wars delivers."
jorgegoraieb,"Jan 28, 2021",10/10,"A masterpiece....difficult to improve on A New Hope yet it does....very rarely watch a movie more than once...,,amongst those exceptions are Lawrence of Arabia, Blade Runner and a New Hope (around 5 times each).....and then, The Empire Strikes Back, 21 times."
caricatunssss,"Dec 6, 2018",N/A,"Definitively not like A new hope. The empire strikes is a good entertaining film. The action sequences are a lot better, we don't see something as stupid as the lightsaber fight between Darth Vader and Obi Wan. The fights are slow but intense. The stuff that happens on the film actually seems important, not like the boring stuff of A new hope. The empire strikes back creates some genuine tension on the plot. Characters are better now. They were good on A new hope, but only because they were fun. On here, we see the more of the characters, and the movie makes the viewers sympathize with them. The characters aren't profound by any means, but they're interesting. And here, i can forgive that Darth Vader is boring, because the movie adds some plot twists at the end that actually points to something interesting in the next movie. Is a classic, definitively not a masterpiece, but is the perfect entertainment movie."
nycchevy,"Sep 2, 2006",10/10,"Many feel The Empire Strikes Back is even better than Star Wars. Is this true? I really don't know, as Star Wars is probably the greatest film ever made, but many say ESB is as well.In many ways, Empire does surpass Star Wars as we get to know the characters even better and see their further adventures unfold. And the special effects - incredible. Much better than today's computer images. It is hard to believe scenes such as the Hoth Battle and the asteroid chase were filmed almost thirty years ago! Empire, if it is or isn't better than Star Wars, has to be one of the most perfect films ever made, to say the least. A timeless classic."
KlinePatsy,"Aug 5, 2007",10/10,"Star wars is a Saturday morning breakfast serial, with the upbeat 'let's have an Olympic medal ceremony' ending...Empire discards the fluffiness and moves away from its simplistic predecessor's obvious appeal to the child fanbase, without scaring everybody away in the process. The 2nd Star Wars film takes the original cast and subjects them to 2 hours of major discomfort...A forbidding icy planet replete with nasty creatures. There are ugly bounty hunters, monsters hiding out in the depths of asteroid fields, and Luke's foray into the black swamp of the Degobah system. It's a more taut, curiously downbeat film that slows almost to a halt in places, as Luke meets the Jedi Master who will teach him the ways of the force. The set pieces more than make up for the lack of pace...The opening battle on the Ice planet is a visually effective affair, and the stormtroopers have never looked as cool when they don their winter outfits. The asteroid chase and cloud city sequence are visual treats, that take you into the mysterious heart of the Star Wars Universe. The character development glues everything together. Luke's maturing process in the darkness of Degobah..Han and Leia's romantic chemistry, the droids comic relief and interplay with Chewbacca solidifies the group together and establishes a team spirit that was coming together at the end of Episode IV. The centrepiece of the film is the epic showdown between Luke and Vader,with that massive revelation, which inevitably ranks as one of Cinema's all time memorable moments. And it's a great sequence, from Vader's sobering welcome 'The force is with you young Skywalker, but you are not a Jedi yet' to the almost surreal climax. The forces of darkness loom large at every turn of the film...you get the feeling that the rebels are just slightly out of their depth. There is an underlying menace at work that heightens the dramatic tension..Vader is never as beautifully evil as he is in Empire. We finally see just why he is (Emperor aside) the top dog in the galaxy, as he lays waste to his own generals in ruthless fashion. We get some great new characters...Han's old buddy Lando Calrissien (sp?) is the slimy administrator of cloud city, who finds himself in a no-win situation, and there's the legendary Boba Fett..bounty hunter with balls of steel, and an outfit so cool it instantly establishes him as a Star Wars icon. And of course, the emperor rears his ugly head, and we get a taster of his malevolance. Any faults? It's hard to find much complaint. Some of the dialogue strays into cheeseland, the pace is interrupted with the curious but necessary Degobah scenes, but all in all, the sum of the parts adds up to a supremely effective, tightly woven sci-fi drama, the most deliciously dark of all Star Wars movies, and the most mature. Classic entertainment, stuck in a time capsule of its own, with enough memorable moments to ensure its place in the higher echelons of cinema history."
Coxer99,"Aug 24, 1999",9/10,"Outstanding follow up to the original ""Star Wars,""with Luke Skywalker learning the ways of a Jedi Knight, while Darth Vader awaits a battle with Luke as he sets up Han Solo and Princess Leia. Amazing in the technical department once again. Unmatched. Unforgettable."
drqshadow-reviews,"Dec 5, 2012",10/10,"Top of the line for a majority of Star Wars geeks, and for good reason. It's the ideal melting pot of George Lucas's vast, quirky imagination, his influences' knack for dark, large-scale epics, and his key contributors' determined efforts to retain a central humanism amidst all the creatures, effects and operatic indulgences. A wildly ambitious picture, it's genuinely amazing just how much territory is covered over the course of two hours. Lucas and company manage to leap from the Hoth battle to Yoda on Dagobah, the asteroid field to Lando and Cloud City, before finally climaxing with the classic Luke / Vader showdown and revelation. That's an awful lot of set pieces, not to mention some seriously powerful plot points, but smooth talking and a few outstanding performances keep the film from feeling over-stuffed or under-explored. The cast, too, grows on an individual basis almost universally, with Luke wrapping himself in the wisdom of the Jedi, Han and Leia developing genuine chemistry and Darth Vader, in a surprise twist that should never have been so effective, actually showing some signs of humanity. Although it can be hammy from time to time, those moments are balanced expertly by a wonderful series of mountains and valleys, to the point that they stop being seen as negatives and instead contribute to the picture's eccentricity. A legendary effort that's just as monumental, entrancing and electric thirty years later, it's damn near perfect."
ronakkotian,"Dec 10, 2019",10/10,"I remember watching The Empire Strikes Back when I was young and just completely loving it. Even today it remains as my favourite film in the franchise.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back follows Luke Skywalker training more and more to become a Jedi whilst Han Solo and Princess Leia are pursued by Darth Vader.After A New Hope, everyone was so excited to see the next Star Wars film. It became one of the most anticipated films of the early 80s and once it finally came out, people just fell in love with it. This is the best Star Wars film to date and here's why.First of all the camerawork in this movie is absolutely excellent. RIP Irvin Kershner, you did a great job. The special effects definitely evolved since Episode IV as they look really good. It's astounding to think that this movie came out in 1980 because how beautiful the set design and effects were. Whilst A New Hope didn't have many fight sequences, this one has plenty and the action scenes are extremely entertaining to watch that keep the adrenaline flowing.Apart from all the positives mentioned, the area where this film shines is its characters. The acting by everyone was superb once again. Writers Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan wrote a beautiful script as we learn more about each of our beloved characters. The chemistry between Leia and Solo is fantastic and quite funny at times. We learn a lot about Luke's past and his relation to Vader which makes up for a great conflict between the two. If you thought Darth Vader was evil in the previous film, wait till you see how menacing he becomes in The Empire Strikes Back. This film also gave us YODA which was an absolute treat.The Empire Strikes Back is my favourite Star Wars film and I don't think any other film can reach its level. The film is well paced alongside some incredible action sequences that keep the intensity going. Our heroes are given a lot of depth which makes us root for them and care about them throughout and the villains have never been so menacing. The Empire Strikes Back is a classic and will remain a classic for a very long time."
mrmutz,"May 29, 2015",10/10,"This film is incredible. I am so thankful for George Lucas and his boldness in writing it. I have watched quite a few documentaries on the Star Wars series and each documentary gives me more and more appreciation for the three films that came out in the 70's. Lucas took quite a risk with the Star Wars franchise and it (obviously) paid off for him. If you haven't, I would definitely suggest looking up some of these documentaries in order to see what the project was actually like when it was first made. The crew and cast describes it as a lot of chaos and self-doubt until its first debut when it gained its cult following. The way that Lucas wrote and directed these films is a tribute to his true genius and success."
jfarms1956,"Apr 6, 2013",6/10,"This film is for SciFi fans. The film is for everyone 7 and older who love SciFi. The film has plenty of action to keep you in your seats. Luke Skywalker undergoes both Jedi training and we see his character develop from the rash young man he was in Star Wars IV. We also begin to see a hint into Darth Vader. I fell in love with Yoda in this movie. All the main characters from Star Wars IV are here. However, it is Luke and Yoda who steal the show. However, the movie did make me feel like I was between episodes and want more. I also felt that it really didn't have a true ending, just a closing of a chapter. However, it is very enjoyable and keeps the Star Wars saga going. Not only do I want more, a continuing story; but I want a beginning. Little did I know that all I had to do was wait a few years. If your are a Star Wars fan, be sure to include this one in your collection."
MrVB,"Sep 9, 1999",4/10,"A good live COMIC BOOK SCI-FI film as opposed to a good film.  Lots of special effects, costumes, aliens, sophomoric dialog and cardboard acting. Great, daring film in its time.  Great film for sci-fi lovers who will watch anything sci-fi because it had a tremendous budget and didn't skimp on production values.Boring to a mature viewer who enjoys other genres as well as sci-fi. Overly violent, illogically sequenced; this is the weak link in the Star Wars saga."
davidmvining,"Dec 12, 2019",10/10,"There are two main ways to follow up a genre film. The first was perfectly encapsulated by Aliens in the ""bigger is better"" school. You expand the stakes, scale, and number of character to create a bigger, bolder experience. The second is to not go bigger, but to go deeper. The Empire Strikes Back might be the best example of that way to go.The Empire Strikes Back actually feels a good bit smaller in scale than the original Star Wars. The biggest battle happens at the beginning of the film, involving a patch of icy land, several large walking tanks, and about a dozen speeders. That is smaller than the couple of dozen fighters attacking a moon sized base that can destroy a planet. The movie never goes bigger than that. In fact, the scale of the conflict continuously gets smaller as the film goes on.At the beginning, the conflict is between the Empire and the Rebel Alliance. It's got galactic consequences, that great battle on the planet of Hoth. If the Rebel Alliance doesn't successfully get away, then the Empire's return strike after the destruction of the Death Star will wipe out its last major adversary for control of the galaxy. The next major set piece is the chase of the Millennium Falcon through the asteroid field. It's now one ship versus a handful of fighters and a Star Destroyer and the uncaring nature of outer space. It's a chase in order to capture the handful of occupants on board so that Darth Vader can lure Luke Skywalker.The final conflict is between Darth Vader and Luke Skywalker. We're more than an hour since the Rebel Alliance has even been mentioned. The conflict involves only two people, not half a dozen. It's no longer about galactic consequences. Instead it's about a father and son and a conflict of good versus evil. The fight of the film narrows, and the only reason it can pull that off is because of the characters.The original Star Wars utilized archetypes to tell its well-worn story. The Empire Strikes Back moves beyond the familiar hero's journey, and in order to accomplish that it needs to move beyond archetypes. Luke is no longer the farmboy hero. Instead he's an arrogant war hero who thinks far too much of himself. Han is no longer just the rogue, but a man with his own sense of right and wrong. Leia is no longer just the princess in need of help, she can push back on Han and control situations like she could only try to in the first. Darth Vader is no longer just the antagonist, he's now got a more complex goal of turning the hero to his side of the overall conflict. These characters are far more interesting in this second adventure than the first, and the story's structure of the second film is built to allow these characters to actually move through actions and change.The center and highlight really is Luke. As I wrote a second ago, he's wildly arrogant at the start of this film. He goes out to check out a meteorite on his own and escapes from the clutches of a giant snow beast without help from anyone else. He also leads the successful feint against the incoming Empire attack on the Rebel base on Hoth, providing enough time for the transports to get away free and destroying a few of the AT-ATs as well. When he's sent to Dagobah to find Obi-wan's former master, Yoda, he thinks that he's beyond humility. He doesn't need it. He's awesome. But from the moment he lands on Dagobah, he fails at everything he does through the rest of the film. The capstone of his training is when he walks into the cave and fails to use the Force in the ways that Yoda had dictated, fighting the phantom version of Darth Vader and revealing that he had only defeated himself in the fight. He fails to raise his X-wing from the swamp. He fails to maintain control of his emotions when visions of Han and Leia suffering come to him. He fails to listen to Leia's explicit warnings of a trap. He fails in his fight against Darth Vader, only escaping through a desperate act of falling down a giant hole.His constant stream of failures, capped by his failed confrontation with Darth Vader, humbles Luke. He no longer feels like he can face the evils of the universe alone. Dangling from the underbelly of Cloud City with only one hand, he calls out to Leia, desperate for any help. Even in the final moments of the film, he stands with his friends, not apart, and has become part of a plan to help the captured Han instead of running out there alone. Luke's journey in this film is fantastic all the more because it undermines the hero's journey he went through in the first. It goes against the idea of how we think hero's behave and succeed after their great victories.It's the character work that really makes the film work, but the movie continues the first film's proud tradition of great design. There are expansions of the world in things like the Super Star Destroyer and the walking tanks the AT-ATs. Yoda is a creature come alive with puppetry. The fighters, the planets, and creatures are all great. The special effects move the technology of the first film forward, and it's always in the service of the great story and character journeys at the heart of the film.Acting takes another step up as well. Moving directing duties from ""Faster, more intense"" George Lucas to Irvin Kershner was a surprisingly good choice overall, but it makes sense once you realize that The Empire Strike Back is more character film than science fiction adventure.The Empire Strikes Back is a magnificent sequel that takes the characters from the preceding adventure seriously and gives them space to grow, propelling them through an adventure that truly tests them. It very rightly stands atop the world of genre fiction as one of the its greatest accomplishments."
JRKITE,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"When talking about The Empire Strikes Back many people have commented on how dark it is in comparison to the other two films from the original trilogy. However as was expected by Star Wars fans, Revenge of the Sith without a doubt took the title of Darkest Star Wars movie from Empire's mantle. Given the galactic scale of tragedy in the final prequel, Empire's personal tragedy reveals itself to be a little self-absorbed. In the post-prequel Star Wars paradigm, we should be able to see the light at the end of the tunnel in the final revelations of Empire.With the issue of darkness settled, the Star Wars audience and the movie-going public should now be able to see The Empire Strikes Back for what it is. The best Star Wars movie. And not only is it a great Star Wars movie, but it is a great movie. The direction, the writing, and even the performances come together to make it a complete movie.Watching the movies that George Lucas has directed, specifically Star Wars: Episodes I-IV, you can tell he is not a student of the craft of acting. The result is that actors are left developing the emotional life of the characters on their own. Some actors are able to survive and even thrive in this environment. Harrison Ford and Alec Guinness give inspired performances in the original Star Wars that make some of the other performances in the movie appear worse than they actually were.George Lucas responsibly tapped his professor from film school, Irvin Kershner, to direct The Empire Strikes Back, and the difference is palpable. Star Wars is without a doubt the most revolutionary in terms of Special Effects of the original trilogy. But in terms of quality movie-making, editing, cinematography, etc., Emipire takes the cake. And all the while putting together great shot after great shot, he managed to pull good performances out of most the cast. Not a single one of the primaries are flat or perform an unbelievable moment. Hamill's performance is so good you actually believe for at least a few minutes that he might stand a chance against Darth Vader.But the quality of film-making and the emotional life of the characters would not have mattered, nor could they have possibly existed without brilliant writing. In Empire Lucas is at his myth-making best (Han's metaphoric descent into hell and Luke's journey into the Dark Cave are brilliant), and the screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasden is sharp, well-paced, and energetic. As a result of this three-part collaboration, you have the rough and romantic flirtations of Han Solo and Princess Leia (in which you can hear the voice of both Brackett's earlier work, The Big Sleep and El Dorado, and Kasden's later work, The Big Chill and The Accidental Tourist). Also you have Yoda-speech when it was genuinely profound in a Confucian way, before it devolved into the gimmicky and painful form it takes in the prequels.On the whole there is no denying that Star Wars: A New Hope is the most influential movie of the series, quite possibly of the last quarter of the twentieth century (although it would have to fight with Jaws for that title). And with the fall of Anakin Skywalker in Revenge of the Sith, it no longer can be called the darkest of the Star Wars saga. But it is, with little doubt the best movie of the series."
owenpont-70803,"Jul 10, 2022",10/10,"So good. Star Wars A New Hope was amazing when it came out. So the hype around The Empire Strikes Back was huge. But wow, this film was awesome. The film did everything that made the first film great and added with it. From the iconic twist, to introducing new characters such as Bobba Fett, Lando Calrissian and the other bounty hunters. It added on so many new things and it worked great. Overall this is a classic film that everyone should watch, Star Wars fan or not, the original trilogy is a must watch for everyone."

prisonerinmysoul,"Aug 20, 2018",10/10,"While Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (1977) started the ball rolling with a bang, Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back (1980) takes that explosive start and runs with that momentum in leaps and bounds. I've seen many sequels over the years, Terminator 2, Aliens, RoboCop2, Shrek 2, Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings (bare with me on those two since I know they're book series), etc. and yet none of them seem to hit the beats of the development of the characters and plot alongside the action so perfectly balanced. I don't know, my review may seem a little ramble like but it's just one of my all time favorite movies and I'm kind of at a loss of words for how to talk about it professionally."
generationofswine,"Nov 14, 2017",10/10,"So, I was almost 1 when this movie dropped and, well, it started the opening night tradition.OK, well, how to do this? I guess we will start with the hate. I like to address the hate in movies, especially ones that are well regarded and loved.Now, I'll excuse it for the people that just don't like Star Wars. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion.But then there are the people that really hate Empire because of...reasons. And those reasons are Revenge of the Sith.I'm sorry, panning Empire because of loyalty to the prequels--misplaced as it is--doesn't make I-III any better. It just makes you petty.Now, why its loved and, I'll admit, I am one of those fanboys that really do love this movie.For starters, Empire went dark. It was the really the episode that the good guys lost and, that made it unique among, well, among just about every movie not made in the 1970s. I guess that is what made the 70s such a wonderful time for movies.We could use a little more of that. We could use a lot more of that. We use a lot more gritty in cinema. And, we could use a lot more ""lived in"" Everything looks too clean.Empire had that.And then it had that big, legendary, reveal that made all those kisses between Luke and Leia utterly wrong once the second big reveal hit in 1983...which explained that look Han gave Leia when she told him in the next installment.Moving on...We have the Battle of Hoth, which, yeah, nerd awesomeness with kind of a WWI trench warfare v tanks feel and a WWII Evacuation of Dunkirk feel with the rebels on the run and the Empire forcing its way across the galaxy with brute strength.And that prolonged time on the Falcon, well, that was just brilliant for character development and, incest blocking.So, really, honestly, there was way too much to love not to put Empire on the throne."
veryape-887-913905,"Jan 25, 2014",9/10,"In my opinion this is not only better than the first film or the fourth whatever but it is the best in the entire franchise. I loved it from the first minute until the last, I love star wars even since I was about 4 years old and I used to hate this movie but when I watch it now it's just amazing. Also in this film great Star Wars characters make their debut with the likes of Yoda and Orlnado Calrizion (if that is how you spell it and I can't remember if it is Orlando and Lando so excuse me if I got it wrong.)This film starred Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford & Carrie FisherI highly recommend this film to all you sci-fi fans****/***** not outstanding but very good"
owenmul,"Mar 27, 2015",10/10,"The Empire Strikes back is the best of the original trilogy, as well as being the best of the entire series. Its so good that it is on my top ten films of all time. It manages to switch between the cheery space opera tone of the original film with added darkness and despair.The characters this time around are given much more screen time to grow and develop, being ever more three-dimensional. This depth of character is what adds to the first film and makes it so much better than the rest of the series. It shows the good and the evil, the greed and corruption and the tyranny that grows within the corners of the of the Star Wars universe.The cinematography, score and special effects remain quite consistent, moving on from those that were present in the first film. The only exception of this is the special effects, which have been slightly spruced up since the first film.The story itself has become a lot more brutal and unforgiving, without moving into spoilers, it fully embraces the dark side of the force and fully explores the darkest corners of its plot.It is because of the emotions stirred in Empire that the entire series takes on a mythic quality that resonates back to the first and ahead to the third.This is the heart of the franchise, this is the peak. Everything that has been added and built upon from the first film is fantastic, there are no conceivable downsides to this space epic.More Reviews at: http://12yearsacinephile.tumblr.com/"
kenjha,"Oct 12, 2007",7/10,"The second ""Star Wars"" film to be released has non-stop action, but the problem is that there is no compelling plot to make the action interesting. Endless shots of star ships gliding through space soon become tedious. The last third of the movie does generate some interest but it's too little, too late to save this from being more than a mediocre entry in the series. The other problem is that it just stops abruptly, relying too much on the sequel to clean up the loose ends. The dialog is amateurish and there is too much emphasis on special effects. Yoda is cute but Chewbacca and R2-D2 become increasingly annoying with the silly noises they make."
acedj,"Nov 1, 2019",10/10,"Like the Wrath of Khan, Empire improves upon the first movie in the series. In fact, once all three were out, this remained the best of them. Often times the second movie of a trilogy feels more like a step that was needed to reach the conclusion rather than an adventure of its own. Empire succeeded where so many others failed, even in the modern trilogies. The characters are further developed, the special effects are ground breaking and the universe in which this is based is rich."
philmarston1981,"Nov 25, 2018",10/10,I love this episode of the series. It's a fun comfortable watch for me and I enjoy everything about it.My only wish is that I could watch the original trilogy again without the added F/X and remastering.
DragoonKain,"Oct 17, 2003",10/10,"This is how sequels should always be done.  Higher budget.  Preplanned story arc.  And memorable dialogue.  The best sequel ever made hands down.  In many ways this film is even better than its predecessor.  But, unfortunately, because it doesn't stand so well on its own, it will always be considered the second best Star Wars movie."
EmperorCrispy,"Sep 10, 2008",10/10,"I saw this movie in the theater in 1980 multiple times and many times since. It is a great film and tasty ""meat between the sandwich"" sitting in between A New Hope and Return of the Jedi. This film has it all from a battle in the snow with mechanical walking beasts, a trip to a swamp planet to introduce the legendary Jedi master, a beautiful city in the clouds that houses the climatic end to the film. This film is darker and more menacing than the other 2 films including a more evil Darth Vader and introductions to the mysterious Bounty Hunters including Boba Fett. Excellent effects, beautiful locations, top character development and Masterful directing. Go rent it out, you wont be disappointed."
Jonathan-Puntervold,"Nov 16, 2003",10/10,"One of my seven 10s (of my about 200 rated movies) are given to this movie. And when I first wanted to vote for it, I had just seen it, yet again experienced the class, the acts, the dialogue, the action, the characters, the amazing adventures of Han, Luke and the rest. And let's just say that I hadn't seen it in years just before I voted. And a 10 sounded so, well, unreal, especially when you should actually presume that it's the original Star Wars which deserves a 10. If one of the movies should have one. But it was this one I found right. I still do. I am sure that this is the absolutely greatest adventure movie of all time. Of all Star Wars movies. Of the Indiana Jones movies. And of the Lord Of The Rings movies. Of every adventure movie I have seen, this one is the very best. Why, you will probably ask. Most people I know either prefer Star Wars IV or VI to this one. But I think they forget to take acquintance to the amazing chemistry there is between all the cast in this movie. And the classic scenes, there are many more than in the other movies. Luke meeting Yoda, and Yoda's amazing wisdom for such a small, little green alien. Vader confronts Luke. The truth revealed. Han and Leia's first kiss, and C-3POs interference. The introduction of Lando. Boba Fett. Admiral Piett's absurd rise to great Imperial stature. The battle of Hoth. Han frozen into carbonite. Just about everything of the dialogue, acting, everything of it is so classic, so climatic, so absolutely real. The Empire Strikes Back is the absolutely finest film in the entire Star Wars series. It's so intense, its plot and subplots are perfectly intertwined, just about everything in the film is perfectly fit for its genre. This is why this movie deserves a 10."

IonicBreezeMachine,"Jul 23, 2022",10/10,"Following the events of the last film, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew),Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), their droids R2 (Kenny Baker) and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels), and the rest of the rebel alliance have been driven into hiding on the ice planet Hoth after their destruction of the Death Star. Darth Vader(physical: David Prowse, voice: James Earl Jones) continues his search for Skywalker and eventually finds the rebel base with the rebel forces forced to retreat and Luke is separated while Han and the others attempt to elude pursuit of the Empire. Luke travels to the Dagobah system at the direction of his deceased master Obi-Wan (Alec Guinness) and directs Luke to locate his former master Yoda. As Luke dives deeper into the teachings of the Jedi and The Force, Luke's friends will face a danger that will force Luke to make a choice that could lead him to the Dark Side and discover revelations that challenge everything he's learned.George Lucas had always planned to expand Star Wars even if the first film proved unsuccessful down to contracting author Alan Dean Foster who wrote the novelization of Star Wars to write a limited location sequel novel that could be adapted on a low budget released as Splinter of the Mind's Eye. When Star Wars broke Box Office Records, Lucas reappraised his approach to the sequel leaving the Foster adaptation as novel (which became a success in its own right and the start of the Expanded Universe) and proceeding to plan a much more ambitious sequel. Lucas having felt the strain of directing Star Wars opted to take a role as Executive Producer and instead handed the reins to Irvin Kershner. The script received a lot of input from multiple parties as Lucas had many different ideas on how to approach the subject of Luke's father (who was not yet the reveal we know), Luke's sister (also originally a new character), and expanded roles for the Galactic Emperor and other planets which weren't deemed feasible. The script was given multiple passes by several writers including notably Lawrence Kasdan who had impressed Lucas with his work on Raiders of the Lost Ark. Upon initial release some critics were mixed in the darker tone from the original film with some outright lambasting the film, but overtime The Empire Strikes Back has been re-evaluated as not just the best film in the series, but one of the best sequels of all time.From the movie's introduction, it makes it clear to the audience that while the destruction of the Death Star was a victory slowing the threat of the Empire, it didn't stop them as the Rebels are forced to hide on the desolate ice planet of Hoth while Vader searches the galaxy intent on finding Luke. The harshness of the ice world is a fantastic setup with its bitter and inhospitable cold serving as a nice counterpoint to the original desert planet we saw in Star Wars and gives us the feeling of a new and unfamiliar place we've not yet explored. The characters also feel like they've advanced with Luke Skywalker carrying a more hardened demeanor in contrast to the fresh faced youth we were introduced to him as and Han and Leia have both advanced with the two developing a relationship and Han having become less cynical and self-serving as a character. The movie keeps itself mostly pretty simple with Luke embarking on a journey of self-discovery with Jedi master Yoda voiced and puppeted by Frank Oz and the character is a solid mixture of quirky, weird, and wise that makes him a unique mentor figure for Luke to play off against. The action scenes have also been expanded upon with a larger scale and more ambitious effects with the Battle of Hoth sequence featuring some great computer assisted Stop Motion to bring to life walking battle tanks called ""Walkers"" that look amazing in motion as well as destruction. We also get Billy Dee Williams as Han's former friend Lando who plays the role with the same cocky swagger as Han but still gives his own spin on it and gets some good moments in the film as a character. Darth Vader remains a solid antagonist in the film with his menace dialed up as the primary antagonist this time around, but also some solid revelations that are now famous (you know what I'm talking about) and some terrific pitch black humor of Darth Vader ""promoting"" various officers to Admiral after the previous one failed him.The Empire Strikes Back is a great film in its own right and one of the best sequels of all time. The characters you loved the first time around are expanded upon and revisited and the world is made to feel alive and bigger with new environments and world building that make the film an engaging sit even when you know what's coming."
Brennan_InterrogativeMan,"Oct 15, 2002",10/10,"When The Empire Strikes Back was released for the first time, I didn't think it would be as good as the very first Star Wars that was released because usually a sequel isn't as good as a prequel. But boy was I ever wrong!!! In my opinion, I think that this is not only the best sequel, but the best movie ever made.Everthing about this movie is excellent, from the battle that's taken place on Hoth, to the climatic battle between Darth Vader and Luke Skwalker, where Luke finds out about his secret destiny.....This movie also introduces a new character named Yoda {who is about the size of a dachshund when it stands on 2 legs}. If you were to see Star Wars: Episode II: Attack of The Clones, you would find out why people in the Star Wars universe call him ""master"". I like the way he sounds like say fozzie bear from the muppet babies and his backwards spelling like, ""Powerful jedi, was he.""As I said with another review about ""Return Of The Jedi"", I owe it all to George Lucas. Without him, Star Wars wouldn't have been created. Thanks George Lucas!"

r_scott73,"Mar 17, 2012",10/10,"It is not always possible for a sequel to re-capture the peculiar magic of an original film. 'The Empire Strikes Back' manages to do so by being less of a sequel than it is a new film on its own. The story begun in 'Star Wars' is advanced, the characters & their relationships with one another are deepened and the film itself abandons much of the easy spirit of the first film in favour of a darker and more uncertain tone. If the first film was largely about heroism, the second is largely concerned with struggle. The main characters are soundly tested in this film and for the most part, they come up short.This is also the film that transforms Darth Vader into one of the screen's great villains. Vader was interesting in 'Star Wars,' but he is iconic in 'The Empire Strikes Back' and he rightfully takes his place as not only a great villain, but a great character. In spite of the despair that runs through the film, the visuals and imagination so apparent in 'Star Wars' returns here, as well. The film is littered with awesome action sequences and more than enough 'coolness' to measure up to its predecessor.Again, the original (1980) version is the one to see - if given the option - although the enhancements made to this film are somewhat less invasive than those applied to 'Star Wars.' Still, the film is more charming and more polished its original release. It is considerably less delightful than its predecessor, but it is every bit as good of a film, if not even slightly superior to 'Star Wars.'"
freewillyfan,"Nov 30, 2019",10/10,This is in my opinion the best Star Wars movie yet. It improves upon the first movie and has the one of the best plot twist of all time. Luke's Story in this is great and Yoda is a lot of fun. Darth Vader is an even better villain in this film. This film is fun and exciting from beginning to end. It never gets slow and is fast passed. This is an amazing film.9.5/10
bat-5,"Oct 30, 1998",N/A,"After the success of Star Wars you would think that it can't get any better. Well it did.  Empire is much more ambitious than the first one, and it shows.  The story is more involved, it carries the story arcs from the first one over flawlessly.  The Battle of Hoth is amazing to watch, as is the asteroid chase.  Luke begins his training as a Jedi and we see in the tree that he is going the way of Vader.  Han and Leia squabble but they slowly start to warm up to each other in a classic scene of love finding its way through dialogue that never mentions their love for each other.  Yoda's philosophy of ""do or do not.""  are words to live by.  Throw in the smooth talking Lando and a light saber duel that is truly exciting and you got yourself one hell of a follow up to one of the greatest films of all time. All that and finding out that Darth Vader is Luke's father!"

masonsaul,"Dec 17, 2019",10/10,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is a masterpiece that offers the best example of how a sequel can go darker without losing the heartfelt, child friendly nature of its predecessor. It somehow manages to be stronger than an already incredible original, comfortably buoyed by having one of the greatest twists in all of cinema. It also says a lot that this is the film least affected by the special edition alterations because there's barely anything to improve.Mark Hamill strikes a balance between showing how Luke has matured since A New Hope but and how he still has so much to learn. Harrison Ford's roguish charms continue to make Han Solo highly lovable and Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia remains eternally confident, making their blooming relationship just as investing as any action scene. Billy Dee Williams gives Lando Calrissian a suitably suave entrance and Anthony Daniels gets most of his best work playing C-3PO.Darth Vader has only gotten more ruthless which is clear from his complete lack of tolerance for other people's failure and James Earl Jones' phenomenal voicework ensuring he always controls the room in every scene. Frank Oz is perfect as Yoda, bringing an initially adorable yet deliberately misleading presence to keep proceedings lighthearted for a bit longer before adding the necessary sense of wisdom for a Jedi Master who has been training Jedi for 800 years.Irvin Kershner's direction is fantastic, skillfully controlling bigger action sequences that impress further thanks to how they can move directly into one another during the first act whilst balancing several things at once. The lightsaber fight is a substantial improvement because it's obvious Luke is out of his depth and it quickly becomes a struggle to survive. The dialogue retains a very quotable nature but it is noticeably stronger in this screenplay by Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan.There is a clear visual glow up too due to an increased budget and even better visual effects work across the board, making the galaxy feel even more fully realised when they're combined with the new planets explored. John Williams rivals his own work and barely repeats himself with his score here, creating several new themes that are so good it's hard to believe they weren't present in the last one, especially the Imperial March because it makes the Empire so imposing."
jrf2,"Apr 5, 2003",10/10,"When I first saw The Empire Strikes Back I didn't really care for it. I wasn't really into the darkness that covered the movie. Now, I'm a little older and can appreciate this movie. This is the best Star Wars movie hands down. Not my favorite, but the greatest.This takes the Star Wars saga to a whole new level with the introduction of Yoda and the fleshing out of Darth Vader. Every returning character from A New Hope is given so much more to work with and it shows. We learn more about Han's past, Luke's past, and Luke's future. The visual feel of the movie is incredible. From Bespin, the cloud city to Dagobah, the lonely hideout for Master Yoda, each one of the locations presented support the turmoiled, chill of space feel that dominates the movie.The climax of the movie is the most memorable climax of all time. It's been alluded to more times than can be counted. It also takes the battle between good and evil from a back and white area to a shade of gray. The fact that the innocence of Luke can come from the pure evil of Darth Vader is perhaps the biggest revelation.This is one of the best sequels of all time. Check it out.**** out of ****"
randyhndrsn,"Jan 15, 2006",10/10,"This is one of my favorite movies, and one of the best movies that has ever been made.Star Wars was a great movie, and a sequel being better then it seemed impossible, but empire strikes back is a better movie with a lot of good stuff.The special effects are still good today and the story is pretty good, i love a lot things that this movie has that star wars didn't.Like a lot better fight scenes, and they show a lot more of places and planets then the 1st one.I was very pleased with this movie and think it is a great film for a true movie fan to watch, i disagree with a lot of people who say it is the best star wars movie.But i can understand why they say it, empire has a lot of things to it that are just well done and impressive.I think this movie is worth owning and is a movie you can watch many times."
film-critic,"Mar 18, 2008",10/10,"Hoth. Yoda. Cloud City. That moment when you realize family really does matter  priceless.Individually these words represent small facets of pop culture, making whatever the question is in Trivial Pursuit obviously ""Star Wars"", but when you put them together, in this order, the words ""Empire Strikes Back"" will inevitably fall from your mouth. The second chapter (or fifth, however you count them) in Lucas' grandiose space opera involves a frozen planet, a little green man, the force, family, and eventually a good old fashioned hand losing. (Should I have put Billy Dee Williams somewhere in there?) A personal favorite among the original three, I grapple with words because what can be said about this film that hasn't already been said dozens, even hundreds of times. This is a staple to my youth, a film series that I have seen over and over in no particular order. For this viewing, I went with the classic Laserdisc edition which reminded me that no amount of special effect could change the heart of the story. What can be said? What should be said? In Skywalker's famous words to Yoda, ""I can give it a try""  we all know, by heart, what will follow next.""The Empire Strikes Back"" is the strongest chapter in the original trilogy for three reasons. The first is that we have three subsequent chapters, each dealing with a different world, in a different galaxy far, far away. Lucas, in my eyes, has expanded his opera into more than just a desert planet, or a wooded terrain, or on a star that causes death; he grew and blossomed with this film. As audience members, we believe in each of the settings, we understand how cold it is on Hoth, we can feel the moisture on Degoba planet, and our fear of heights is prevalent in Cloud City. Lucas defines, travels, and leaves out no detail as he escapes with us through this expanding universe. Moving onto a second note, this is a darker chapter. Without repeating what so many others have said before, Lucas challenges us to escape from scene after scene of battle (albeit he does put a small dusting in) and listen to the words that his characters are telling us. He places small Easter eggs throughout that still gives us goose bumps as we watch (and understand), he hints towards the final chapter, but without really giving us the entire sandwich, just a sample. This smattering of the unknown, the final scenes where Vader reveals his journal's secret to Luke, the iconic nature of the slicing of the hand, all of this matches against any battle scene any science fiction director could create. Lucas has always been criticized for his lack of character development in his six-part series, and with Jar-Jar I can understand, but he had hit his stride with what he wanted from his leads. I could see the spark between Leia and Han, the love between Chewie and C3PO, and Yoda's Oz like abilities when he explains to Luke that the force lives in nature. Lucas is telling us, giving us the chance to see that the final battle will be a line up between Nature and Machine  get ready Ewoks. Finally, this film is the strongest because it is a victorious battle for the dark side of the force. Very rarely do movie audiences walk out of a theater and feel as if hope has been crushed on the curb. Each time I view this film, I get this child-like sensation that maybe, just maybe, Vader and the Emperor will crush this little Rebel Alliance in the final chapter and reign supreme forever. ""Empire Strikes Back"" gives you that sense of possible dark side victory, with the call of the bounty hunters, the frozen carbonate, and the loss of Skywalker's ambidextrous abilities. Think of it this way, was the Dark Side really that evil, or did they just wear black and pursue those that were unwilling to follow the law? Goth British police officers?In all honesty, ""Empire Strikes Back"" could be re-watched at this moment. There are less big fight sequences than in ""Return of the Jedi"", and there are less moments of confusion and droid humor, ""Empire"" stands on its own because it remains an elusive, dark chapter. Our leads, those that we have given our hopes, hearts, and dreams to, have all been fooled, tricked, or captured, and it feels confined (like it is only the Millennium Falcon vs. an entire armada of Star Destroyers) in this middle chapter. You leave the theater wondering about that infamous ""Who shot J.R.?"" moment, and a desire to see the Force be victorious. To me, this middle chapter gave the Dark Side of the Force an equal opportunity to make a case for itself; ""Star Wars"" is an equal opportunity employer.Obviously, I loved this film. It has been a staple, like so many others, in my youth for years and further into my adulthood. I love these characters, these worlds, the unknown, and especially Lucas' vision. Despite the criticism of the ""new"" chapters, we will always have the original to go back to in any shape or form.Without sounding repetitive, watch this series. Introduce your children to this world(s), and allow them to grow up with the largest space opera created. Spark their imagination, and you will not be disappointed.Grade: ***** out of *****"
kurciasbezdalas,"Dec 14, 2008",10/10,"I'm not sure which part I liked more - this one or the original. But this part sure is better in some terms. Like special effects, which were really better than in the first part (probobly because of the bigger budged). It's also better in terms of action. The sword fights were much more impressive than in first part. The starship battles were also very impressive and pretty realistic. Many new colorful and very important characters appeared in this part. What else did I liked was Darth Vader's position in this part. Here he looked more dangerous and independent than in the first part. It's a really entertaining movie and it's worth watching."
easternmoviecritic,"Aug 3, 2009",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back is an example of how well done a sequel can be, it takes the series to a whole new level and is an improvement over A New Hope. The amazing thing is that this time Lucas wasn't the director. That doesn't change anything, he guided Irvin and ESB is still his creation.This time everything is on a larger scale. The battles aren't puny and meaningless, they are actual battles. The movie starts with the battle for the icy world Hoth. From there the plot splits in 2, one being with Luke and one with the rest: Leia, Han, Chewie, 3PO and R2.We are explained in more detail how the Force works and we see how truly powerful the Empire is. Thanks to the money Lucas earned from A New Hope, The Empire Strikes Back has better special effects and some splendid locations, including Hoth and Bespin.But it's not all about battles, the love story part of the series is also developed, Luke's struggle to understand the Force and use it continues, while Vader is more determined than ever.Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is a remarkable chapter of the Star Wars saga.Final Score: 5/5 or 10/10"
scott-sw,"Jan 24, 2008",10/10,"Call me blasphemous, but cinematically, The Empire Strikes back is far superior to the original Star Wars. We pick up shortly after the destruction of the Death Star. The Empire has dispatched probe droids to find the rebels. One probot finds a base on the remote world of Hoth. Frustrated, the rebels must bug out. Commander Luke Skywalker and his flight team make their stand against giant AT-AT Walkers and Imperial Snow Stormtroopers. Meanwhile, Leia cannot get to her transport, so Han Solo must get her out on the Millennium Falcon. Darth Vader is obsessed with finding Skywalker so he wants the Falcon. He will stop at nothing--even asteroids. Vader tracks them to Bespin where Han hopes an old friend, Lando can help out. However, Vader beat them there and force Lando to turn them over. Luke ventures to Dagobah to meet Yoda, the Jedi Master. There he undergoes training to be a Jedi. As he learns to focus the Force, he has a vision of Han and Leia suffering in a city in the clouds. He leaves training prematurely to face Vader. He is not ready. And he learns of Vader's secret. Star Wars was an introduction and The Empire Strikes Back goes deeper. At the outset, we learn more about the Force and how it can help. It was only vaguely touched on in the first one. We also learn more of Vader's sinister side. In the first one, his presence and appearance exuded evil. In this one, he demonstrates it through dispatching the Empire officers who fail him. We also get to see Leia and Han grow closer. Their love blossoms and grows. They had real chemistry. Finally, Luke really grows. He is the impatient, naive, and adventurous boy. He suffers for his decision. This forces him to mature. While some people found Chewabaca's incessant howling over the fate of Han Solo, I found it touching, giving the great side-kick alien depth and soul. The magic of Star Wars is unmeasurable. It was great swashbuckling fun with age old themes of good triumphing over evil. It allowed us to escape and be struck with wonder and awe. Empire, though, is thoughtful, deep, analytical, and fun. The audience will identify with Luke, Han, Leia and Chewie all the more because of their suffering. At this point, they were no longer larger than life, but human. I compare this to falling in love. With Star Wars, the infatuation and lust begins. With Empire, the love deepens and becomes solid. If it never happened, the love would not mature. This is Lucas truly at his best. I hope he recaptures this someday."
lee_eisenberg,"Oct 4, 2005",10/10,"I don't know whether or not ""The Empire Strikes Back"" was better than ""Star Wars"" or not, but it's pretty much equally good. Since everyone knows the plot, I figure that I'll just talk about a few aspects. It's weird to think that Yoda was only introduced here; he's been such a central character in the series that it's easy to forget that he didn't star in Episode 4! In some ways, watching ""TESB"", you get the feeling that the people behind the scenes realized how lucky the series was making them, and so they decided to go all out. And they do just that. They played it to good effect here (I personally thought that ""Return of the Jedi"" overdid it a little). But anyway, the Force is with this movie from start to finish!"
wellthatswhatithinkanyway,"Apr 1, 2007",10/10,"STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday MorningAfter George Lucas's Star Wars had wowed the world in 1977, the same world eagerly waited the big sequel that followed three years later, that was loved just as much, in some cases slightly more so, than the first film. It no doubt took twice as much effort to make, and drew in a huger box office crowd, and in doing so The Empire Strikes Back established itself as the film that rivalled the film it followed on from.All the main characters from the first film are back, including Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill), Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Obi-Wan Kenobi (Alec Guiness) and lovable non humans Chewbacca, R2-D2 and C-3PO, along with new addition Lando (a charismatic turn by Billy Dee Williams) a rogue pal of Han's who's now the head of his own establishment, as well of course as Yoda, the tiny green martian with wisdom who guides Luke on his way. The story's a bit too lost in names of special planets, spaceships and character names that only the most ardent sci-fi nerd is going to follow intently, but once again, the sheer spectacle and grandeur of Lucas's work over-shadows everything, a remarkable vision that still hasn't dated or staled over 25 years on.So sit back, relax and prepare to witness the sheer scale of escapist entertainment. *****"
ryanadavis-62779,"Nov 23, 2023",N/A,"The Empire Strikes Back is directed by Irvin Kershner and the epic saga continues as Luke Skywalker, in hopes of defeating the evil Galactic Empire, learns the ways of the Jedi from aging master Yoda. But Darth Vader is more determined than ever to capture Luke.

This movie has better action, great music, and the characters in this movie are brilliant. Mark Hamill is back as Luke Skywalker and so is Harrison Ford as Han Solo and Carrie Fisher as Princess Leia. The Empire Strikes Back will always be the best Star Wars movie ever made."

trooper5783,"May 17, 2015",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back is one of the few movies I call pitch perfect. Everything is flawless- the action? Edge of your seat! The drama? Heart-wrenching and powerful! The comedy? Frequently clever and hysterical! The special effects? Better than A New Hope, and then some! As for the 2004 DVD version, it still has the original flavor of the theatrical cut, the touches are few, and still has most shots from the original version. Also, may I add that all of the characters are perfectly developed and lovable, villain or hero. Han Solo is a great character in this, all because of his charming and awesome performance by Harrison Ford. My favorite character from Star Wars is Chewbacca, and there is no exception here. The stop motion animation done with the AT-ATs and the Taun-Tauns still are amazing today, and the wonders of the ship battles are just as beautiful. Overall, Empire is my favorite Star Wars, and one of my favorite movies. It has everything- heart, humor, action, drama, suspense. I highly recommend you see this one(if you haven't seen it already)."
gavin6942,"Apr 7, 2010",9/10,"Any comments here refer to the theatrical release, not the pile of rubbish known as the special edition. Rick McCollum should be tracked down and given a good kick in the pants.In your epic battles of good and evil, ""Empire Strikes Back"" pretty much takes the cake. We have everything here -- characters with depth, tragedy, romance, adventure... aliens that are believable. It has become cliché to compare ""Star Wars"" to ""Lord of the Rings"", and that's not entirely unfair... but, really, ""Star Wars"" is better and ""Empire Strikes Back"" is the best.As Dante Hicks says in ""Clerks"", this film is the best because it imitates life, ""a series of down endings"". Sometimes life is better than that, but it's often not. And whereas most movies want happiness, this one put Luke and Han in a bunch of bad situations with no hope of escaping unscathed. That's what makes this fantasy very much reality."

tjgoalie13,"Oct 28, 2015",10/10,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back is arguably the best Star Wars film ever made, and one of the best films ever made. The film immortalized the already iconic characters that George Lucas created in Star Wars, while making a very dense and entertaining film. The Empire Strikes Back is so great because of the improvements made to Darth Vader, the ambitious tonal change, and the fact that it still contains one of the best twists ever. With enough analysis the most impressive thing about The Empire Strikes Back is how hard it is to find flaws in the film.Darth Vader still stands, and probably always will stand as one of the best villains ever brought to the screen, second on my list only to The Dark Knight's Joker. However, in Vader's first appearance Vader is slightly inconsistent in that he's a temperamental villain often yelling, which isn't nearly as scary as a villain who remains calm. I would contest that the best villains act like they are always in control, whether they are not, it is in The Empire Strikes Back that Vader develops into this villain, while also systematically murdering his failing accomplices. It could be argued that Vader's development helped the tonal change that Empire Strikes Back brought.It's another testament to the villain, when they are so chilling that the tone of the film seemingly dives with them. As Vader develops into the more controlled, systematic villain the tone of the film dives into a darker world. With Star Wars being considered, at least partially, a kids film it seems extremely ambitious of Lucas and Kershner to make a film directed at kids dark, something many filmmakers are unwilling to do today. The dark tone helps accentuate the character development as the characters hit their all time lows, and the film's tone represents that the world isn't always nice.The story for Empire Strikes Back, being the middle film in the trilogy, had the most freedom, and used it accordingly. The story of Empire Strikes back is arguably, the strongest in the series, as the film was one of the earliest to say the bad guy can win, in a giant blockbuster, another very ambitious move. However, the best element of the story is the unpredictable turns it makes, in particular it's iconic twist. The twist remains one of the most famous of all time, for a reason, and the film benefits from it.In the end Empire Strikes Back has the best story in the trilogy, the best character development, is very ambitious, and immortalizes it's iconic villain. On top of all of that it has been copied numerous times over the years, and remains one of the best films ever made. Empire Strikes Back still stands as the embodiment of what makes Star Wars so great."
alene2,"Jun 23, 2020",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back expands upon the established world of Star Wars without forgetting what made the first movie so amazing. The effects are just as enthralling as they were in Star Wars (if not more so), as shown in the amazing new worlds that Empire introduces (Hoth, Cloud City, Dagobah), and John Williams once again blows us away with a score that is on par with his work in the previous movie.
The story takes us in a different direction than Star Wars, giving the audience a greater insight into the workings of the Empire and Darth Vader's character. Vader's arc culminates in his iconic confrontation with Luke Skywalker at Cloud City, which ends with possibly the greatest twist in movie history.
Empire's story is more mature than its predecessor, and leading actors have matured and greatly improved as well (props to Mark Hamill, who did about half of his scenes with a puppet and still made them believable). The dialogue is sharp, the camera work is clean, and new iconic characters get to shine in this movie. I especially loved when Yoda gave his explanation of what the force is, increasing the audience's understanding without removing any its mysticism.
Overall, this movie expertly balances pretty much every aspect it should. The acting, the visual set pieces, the sound design, the score, and the story all shine, combining to create a masterpiece of a movie.10/10"

dantruongcn2007,"Mar 11, 2015",9/10,"For the 1977 film, see Star Wars (film). For other uses, see Star Wars (disambiguation). Star Wars is an American epic space opera franchise centered on a film series created by George Lucas. The film series, consisting of two trilogies (and an upcoming third), has spawned an extensive media franchise called the Expanded Universe including books, television series, computer and video games, and comic books. These supplements to the franchise resulted in significant development of the series' fictional universe, keeping the franchise active in the 16- year interim between the two film trilogies. The franchise depicts a galaxy described as ""far, far away"" in the distant past, and commonly portrays Jedi as a representation of good, in conflict with the Sith, their evil counterpart. Their weapon of choice, the lightsaber, is commonly recognized in popular culture. The franchise's story lines contain many themes, with strong influences from philosophy and religion.author: http://www.internetvietnam.net/Have a nice day."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 9, 2023",9/10,"The first three installments of the Star Wars series of films are easily the best three of the entire series; and this film, The Empire Strikes Back, is the best of the top three. If for no other reason, the development and dramatic impact of the Darth Vader character within this film sets it apart from all the others. When Vader utters those famous five words in a battle scene, we remember them for the rest of our lives. The intensity of this film is greater than the first or third one (and far more than the latter entries). Not one, but a trio of characters, are fleshed out in this film more than in any other Star Wars entry. Obiwan, Luke, and Vader all have great character development. The music is outstanding, the cinematography is outrageously good, and the script is more sophisticated than the first entry. Don't miss the best of the Stars Wars films.What idiots thought that Pulp Fiction or Fight Club were better films than this one? There are probably 99 out of 100 people who think this film is better."
Rise2Glory,"Sep 25, 2001",6/10,I really had a hard time with this one.  I though it was slightly better than A New Hope but not enough to give it a better grade.  The character development really goes into over drive in this instalment of the series. I loved the journey into their lives.  I could only imagine the shock of the Star Wars fans when they found out the truth about Luke's past.Grade...6
lblbannialator,"Nov 26, 2019",3/10,"After a strong start at the Battle of Hoth, the entire movie takes a turn to extremely boring.Say what you will about the Prequels, at least they had highly climactic battles to keep anybody invested the whole way through."
WatchInMyMovies,"Sep 19, 2022",10/10,"When the movie first came out in 1980, fans and critics weren't a big fan over the films more mature tones compared to Star Wars (1977). But since then, critics and fans, including i, have redeemed the movie as the best Star Wars movie, and one of my favorite, sci-fi, and sequel movies, and one of my personal favorites. It is alongside with Terminator 2: Judgment Day and Aliens (1986), one of the greatest sequels of all time. The movie looks better than most CGI-Hollywood films today, and this was made in 1980!, and was made entirely without CGI. The movie stars Mark Hamill, Harrison Ford, Carrie Fisher, Billy Dee Williams, Anthony Daniels, David Prowse, Kenny Baker, Peter Mayhew, and Frank Oz. 10/10, totally recommend it, to every movie fan."
apstylianou,"Dec 3, 2015",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back is the most suspenseful, well-paced and most emotional entry of the Star Wars saga. It's the greatest of movie sequels and as far as it goes, it is everything a sequel to a great movie is supposed to be: a darker tone, more development with the characters, universe expanding with some new and greater additions and features.The perfect adventure telling story that continues from where it left off from and delved deeper into the characters we all know and love today and introduced bigger places in the galaxy far far away that George Lucas originally introduced to us. The action is stunning, the visuals still look ground-breaking today. Empire overall, is just the best movie sequel ever and I don't know if I can call it the best of the original trilogy because its a tough choice between the three of them, to me.But I still love The Empire Strikes Back so 10/10."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Dec 31, 2015",10/10,"In many ways ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is the best and most outstanding of all the movies in the ""Star Wars"" franchise. There is just something epic and very impressive about the story and presentation of the movie.The entire battle of Hoth has left a very lasting impression on me and it captures the struggle of the Rebellion against the Empire very well, and it is filmed in such a manner that it feels like you are right there on the snow-clad battlefield yourself.It really is unnecessary to say how well the cast performed in the movie. But once again, all actors and actresses did prove how perfectly cast they were in this original trilogy.The storyline in ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is very entertaining from start to end, and it has many different aspects and layers to it. And there really is something for everyone to be had in episode five of the ""Star Wars"" saga.Whether you are a fan of ""Star Wars"" or not then ""Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back"" is a movie that you just can't miss out on. And it is a movie that everyone is or should be familiar with."

adamjohns-42575,"May 26, 2023",10/10,"Star Wars: The Empire Strikes Back (1980) -Before I start the review of this film I will state that I do love it, because I love all of the Star Wars universe, especially the original trilogy, but also because it was a really well made film and it was delivered excellently in the same way as the first.I may ramble and reminisce a bit too much at times, not there should be some sort of point to it and actually that's the affect that these films have on a lot of people.This film didn't fall in to the usual trap of a sequel, with repetition and pointless continuation just for the sake of making money. It had some great moments, including laughs, action, space fighting, romance, the whole lot and with an original plot that continued the story because it needed to.I wouldn't have liked to have turned up to it without having seen 'Star Wars' (1977) beforehand and if you have to finish things off due to some sort of O. C. D., like I do, you will need to watch the next one, 'Star Wars: Return Of The Jedi' (1983) too, because this one ends on a cliffhanger.It works as Episode ""V"" of the original 3 (V, IV & VI - Ask George) and of the larger nonet that it became with the release of the Prequel Trilogy (1999/2002/2005?) and the more recent Sequels (2015/2017/2019) too and many regard it very highly on its own, but it certainly couldn't have been released or have been so successful without Episode IV, because I needed to know where they came from, who Ben was, why Luke had magic powers and so on.With that aside, I think that I mostly tend to appreciate this film, because I only remember seeing ""IV"" and ""VI"" on TV as a child, with maybe a few clips of this one, until my parents finally got a Video Cassette Player and of course the all important Cassettes to go with it, which came quite a bit later due to these highly popular productions actually being quite expensive back then.As a result I probably haven't seen this one as often as the other two, but feel a nostalgia based on a clearer teenage mind watching it almost new, as opposed to a 7 year old's memories of cute Teddy Bears (Ewoks) for instance.The story and the character development was great, because it meant that there was more of the universe that I already loved and I got to know my favourites better, whilst other great personalities like Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) and Yoda (Frank Oz) were introduced.""Empire"" actually had some of the better jokes, a great story and many of the classic moments that have since been turned in to memes. Harrison Ford looked mighty fine as Han Solo too.The update of the film, when it was digitally remastered, added some beautiful colours to places like Cloud City and clarity for the rest of the film. I also finally got to see more clearly what it was that attacked Luke at the beginning of the film, which, fun fact, was written in because of a car accident that he had in between recording, which left his face quite hideously disfigured.I also thought that they had realised that Harry had given them a lot more than they had expected in the first film and they seemed to have decided to expand his role in this one to make him more than just a roguish taxi driver. They later did the same, quite cleverly, with Poe (Oscar Isaac) and Finn (John Boyega) in the sequel films, because although the Jedi bit is great, the films have always relied on these additional characters to keep the action going in other ways while the young Padawan gets trained or has extended laser sword fights.The brilliance of this instalment was also added to by yet another superb soundtrack provided by John Williams, who managed to almost completely create something new, on top of the existing themes, but without it being far far away from the general style of sound already used.As far as I'm concerned, you can't go wrong with any of the Star Wars films (Skip 'The Last Jedi' - 2017), because they contain so much heart and a vast knowledge of the film history that had been collated in George Lucas' mind while he grew up. That was obvious with nods to many of the other great epic western, medieval, sci-fi and war films and tales that went before and of course the polish he delivered with each of the films in this series, not to forget the brilliance that came from his own imagination and the superb supporting special effects created by the ILM (Industrial Light & Magic) studios.I look at other films from the late 70's and early 80's and wonder why they didn't put as much in to it as the people that made this original trilogy, because it obviously worked if you want to create something that lasted.962.22/1000."
ladye316,"Oct 2, 1998",10/10,"I love this movie dearly.  We find out Darth Vader is Luke's father, Han and Leia get together, and Boba Fett makes his appearance.  Let's not forget the wonderful Cloud City, Bespin, is first shown."
TheBabblingFool,"Aug 16, 2002",N/A,"This film is without a doubt the worst of the Star Wars movies. I have no idea why people say that this is the best. Watching Episode 5 is watching a really really good movie...then the ending destroys it from being supurb.The film is bigger and has better qualities than the first. It really develops the characters. Han Solo and Princess Leia's off and on love story is very entertaining. Yoda, one of the best Star Wars characters, is introduced, and begins to enlighten Luke on the ways of a Jedi, something we really only heard about in Episode 4.Episode 5 is chock full of excellent special effects (for it's time), the ice planet Hoth is one of my favorite worlds in the Star Wars universe.Everything in this film is better than the first, the acting, the plot, the action. Then it all crashes with the ending...which is so abrupt it's like they just ran out of film that they had to cut it short. I mean they treated it like a TV show, leaving all of the characters in the middle of action and saying ""Tune in next week, same Star Wars time, same Star Wars channel!"" This all leads to them having to finish what they started in Episode 5 in the first 30 or so minutes of Episode 6, giving less time to develop the plot in Episode 6.In the end this is a good movie, bigger than the first, but unless you have enough time to watch it back to back with Return of the Jedi, I can't really recommend it, because it just feels unfinished to me."
bilging,"May 23, 2025",1/10,"For all the talk about this being the ""best"" Star Wars film, it felt like a long, awkward, and incredibly outdated space soap opera. The dialogue is clunky, the pacing is uneven, and the effects-while impressive for 1980-haven't aged well at all.The story is full of long pauses, random plot jumps, and dramatic moments that don't really land. Characters stare at each other a lot, deliver stiff lines, and then something explodes. That's the rhythm. There's very little energy or emotional depth, and for a sci-fi universe that's supposed to feel huge and imaginative, it all felt surprisingly flat and claustrophobic.The action scenes are slow, the romantic subplot feels forced, and even the big twist is handled with more melodrama than real impact. Overall, The Empire Strikes Back just feels old-not timeless. I'm sure it was groundbreaking in its time, but now? It's a slog."
Dan_W_Reviews,"Feb 12, 2023",10/10,"The Empire Strikes Back is an absolute classic science fiction film released back in 1980. It continues the story of Luke Skywalker, Princess Leia, and Han Solo as they battle the evil Galactic Empire.One of the many strengths of this film is its intricate and well-developed plot, which includes numerous engaging twists and turns. The film's visual effects and breathtaking action sequences are mesmerizing, and are elevated by John Williams' iconic musical score.The Empire Strikes Back also delves deeper into the mythos of the Star Wars universe, introducing legendary characters such as Yoda, and exploring the concept of the Force in greater detail. The film's central themes of temptation, sacrifice, and redemption are expertly explored through the character arcs of the protagonists, making this installment both emotionally satisfying and thought-provoking.On a technical level, the film is an undeniable triumph, with excellent production design, costumes, and special effects that hold up even by today's standards. The performances of the cast, especially Mark Hamill as Luke Skywalker, are also standout.In conclusion, The Empire Strikes Back is a masterful and groundbreaking film that is a must-see for fans of science fiction and action. Its timeless appeal and impact on popular culture cannot be overstated, and it remains a favorite of mine to this day which is why I've rated it a 9 out of 10."
HabibieHakim123,"Apr 24, 2022",9/10,"Empire Strikes Back got way more to offer in terms of a story, character, and performances, it's an epic journey with a more clever and exciting continuation, nit picky was still there like A New Hope at least for me, i think Han Solo and Princess Leia relationship was a bit too much and too in depth later in the movie, i mean i like the first couple of them, but overall still Empire Strikes Back is truly a striking sequel that mostly fascinating, it's still an incredible sequel."
Animany94,"Jan 18, 2019",10/10,"I can't say anything new to this massive spectacle of a movie. Everything has already been said, but I can share my personal expirience with you and it was epic, grand, exciting and every positive adjective you could think of!For too long I had gone without watching the original Star Wars trilogy, because reasons unknown, but when I finally sat down and put it on so much felt familiar. Not in a bad way, because I see it like it has made such a huge impact on pop culture that everybody knows Darth Vader is and qoutes the movie's lines and so much more! I hadn't seen it as I said, but it still felt exciting watching every move they made and listening to the magnificent score by John Williams! The big reveal was still epic even though I knew it from people talking about it and saying the famous line.The story structure and the surprise reveal of something to completely change our hero's view on everything he thought he knew has been done so many times after The Empire Strikes Back wrecked theaters and became a phenomenon, so it definitely is the most impactful of all Star Wars films.Everyone tries to make a phenomenal movie, but only few ends up like The Empire Strikes Back!"
Hey_Sweden,"Jul 1, 2013",10/10,"Story author and executive producer George Lucas truly managed to outdo himself when it came to making a sequel to his landmark 1977 ""Star Wars"" film. It combines an appreciably high level of character development with some genuinely exciting and riveting scenes, and introduced the well loved character of diminutive Jedi master Yoda into the formula. Villainous Darth Vader is brought to the forefront rather than being a lackey to somebody else. The relationship between cocky spaceship pilot Han Solo and serious minded rebel leader Princess Leia evolves to where romance can finally take place. And Luke Skywalker becomes more than just the naive and idealistic farm boy, letting his emotions get the better of him.With the directing chores being handed over to Irvin Kershner (""A Fine Madness"", ""Up the Sandbox"", ""Eyes of Laura Mars""), ""The Empire Strikes Back"" marks a maturation in terms of story quality, as well as a willingness to go to some dark places. After all, as it begins, it sees its hero in serious jeopardy. It's never treated as a given that Good will prevail. The screenplay is credited to Leigh Brackett (""The Big Sleep"", ""Rio Bravo"", ""El Dorado"") and Lawrence Kasdan (""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", ""Body Heat"", ""The Big Chill""), and stars Harrison Ford, Mark Hamill, and Carrie Fisher make the most of the material. The endearing Yoda is one of those examples of a puppet who truly does become a character rather than just a gimmick. The film is a little short on cool aliens, but it does feature a Yeti-like monster called a Wampa, and an enormous slug used in a funny ""worm in the apple"" sort of gag. The spectacle is fantastic, but it never overwhelms the story. The early battle scene on the ice fields of the planet Hoth is incredibly well executed, and the final lightsaber duel between Luke Skywalker and Darth Vader (who of course has a revelation in store for the youngster) offers one thrill after another.The special effects are as impressive as ever, and it would be difficult to hear that memorable John Williams score and not get into the spirit of the thing. You truly care about the characters and want to see what will happen with them. And it delivers an ending that perfectly captures a sense of uncertainty and a degree of despair, setting up the problems to be solved in the next film.This is definitely a milestone blockbuster that holds up well 33 years later.10 out of 10."
Ruskington,"Jun 1, 2020",6/10,"Not for the life of me do I understand how people think this is better than its predecessor. Yes it has its moments but there is a distinct drop in quality, not least when it comes to the special effects. At times it looks like watching a close up of toy spaceships being moved around on fishing wire.The development of Skywalker is poor throughout these films and is particularly bad here. His progression from outer-galactic farmhand to Jedi Knight is laughably far-fetched and just doesn't seem feasible. His tutelage under Yoda is under-done and the use of 'The Force' as a plot band-aid is tiresome and insincere, a clear example of Lucas' often childish writing.The battle scenes were poor in A New Hope but get even worse in Empire Strikes Back. Very poor choreography and, even for 1980, pretty amateurish special effects. Did people really find the battle between Skywalker and Vader in any way engaging? I honestly just don't get it.There is plenty to admire about this film and it's certainly not the worst sequel ever made but a classic it is surely not."
gab-14712,"Oct 18, 2017",10/10,"In 1977, a cultural revolution began with the little-known science-fiction film called Star Wars created by visionary director George Lucas. It ended up being the highest-grossing film of all-time and it still ranks very high in the midst of today's blockbusters. It was a very enjoyable movie and it created memorable characters that will live on for eternity. So of course we would get a sequel. In fact, Lucas created a whole world around his baby -an ambition that was not normal in 1980. With the sequel-The Empire Strikes Back, Lucas handed the directorial duties to his former college film professor Irvin Kershner because of his duties with his rising visual effects company Industrial Light and Magic, but of course he was very involved with this film. But enough of the background, let's talk about this film. This sequel is much darker in tone, more mysterious, and quite frankly the best film in the franchise. Our favorite characters like Luke and Leia Skywalker and Han Solo are back and we are introduced to more characters that are stored away in our hearts forever such as Yoda and Lando Calrissian. This is also the movie where we have the famous battle and reveal between Luke and Darth Vaderor shall I say between father and son, but more on that later.After the Rebels blow up the Death Star at the end of A New Hope, they hide away in the icy planet of Hoth. But the rebel base is soon discovered by Darth Vader (James Earl Jones and David Prowse) and the empire. From the battle that ensues, our characters are separated. Han Solo (Harrison Ford), Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher), Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew), and C-3PO (Anthony Daniels) flee across the galaxy from the Empire. They end up going into Cloud City where they come across an old friend of Han's- Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams). Meanwhile, Luke (Mark Hamill) and R2-D2 (Kenny Baker) are sent to the abandoned planet of Dagobath where he continues his Jedi training with an old Jedi master named Yoda (Frank Oz). But will they stay forgotten for long with Darth Vader relentlessly pursuing Luke across the galaxy? One of the biggest improvements over the original film is the visuals. While the visuals in the 1977 film were good for its time period, George Luca's new production company really improved upon the visuals. Along with the visuals, the film has strong production design and character design. I loved the look of Yoda, which was a puppet of course. You can tell the visuals were strong for a variety of reasons. There were the sights of the majestic Imperial Walkers during the battle of Hoth, the hairy sloth creature that attacks Luke after he gets lost on Hoth, the creepy, dense look of Dagobath, the spiral towers of Cloud City, and of course that lightsaber battle between Luke and Vader.SPOILER!! My highlight out of many of them is the revelation that happens near the end of the movie in Cloud City. I am sure most of you have seen the movie but if not, read no further. Darth Vader reveals to Luke during their intense duel that he is Luke's father, Anakin. Of course in the process, Vader chops of Luke's hand and he falls through a chute but is saved from falling to his death thanks to the Millennium Falcon. Also, the movie ends with Han Solo being captured by the Empire and frozen solid. So these events are just some of the reasons why this film is darker and more sinister than the space opera feel of the first film.The acting remains a strong point in the movie. Harrison Ford is excellent as always. I loved his ""wounded ego"" attitude and his bantering with Chewbacca added some lightheartedness to the movie. Yoda is my favorite new character. Not only did they want a realistic puppet, they actually wanted a good actor to bring that puppet to life. And Frank Oz did just that. Mark Hamill and Carrie Fisher remain excellent in their respective roles as Luke and Leia. And the voice of James Earl Jones? Well, the same magic that it always created! Need I say more? Star Wars: Empire Strikes Back is my favorite Star Wars movie, and frankly one of the best sci-fi films of all time. It really expanded upon the mystery and the lore the first film provided. The film explores its mythology in darker tones and that added depth and humanity to our characters. Lawrence Kasdan's and Leigh Brackett's screenplay took Lucas's world and created something that was evolutionary and breath-taking while staying true to its roots. The film ended on a sinister cliffhanger, so you bet we will be seeing a third film. The story and the visuals are fantastic, and now you can see why this is my favorite Star Wars film.My Grade: A+ ""No, I am your father!"" (Vader to Luke) ""Try not, Do, or do not!"" (Yoda to Luke)"
snoozejonc,"Jul 23, 2020",10/10,"The story of the rebellion against the Galactic Empire continues with Luke, Leia, Han, Chewie, R2 and 3PO on another blistering ride.The best praise I can give The Empire Strikes Back is that it was the first Star Wars movie to hold my 3-year-old daughter's attention for the duration. It's easy to see why, as virtually every scene is a new and interesting story.Several great characters are introduced, such as Yoda, Lando, Boba Fett, and the Emperor, who add further interest to the overarching story, while the original movie's favourites of Han, Chewie, Leia, Luke, Darth Vader, and the droids continue to entertain.There are countless cinematic moments, such as the Hoth planet scenes, the epic chemistry between Han and Leia, and virtually everything that happens on Degoba and in the Cloud City. The classic scene with Luke and Vader is so atmospheric and dramatic, you will be hard-pressed not to find yourself role-playing it with your own children one day.John Williams is the true star of the show, as his music fits every scene perfectly. I still catch my daughter humming the Imperial March to herself.Visually, it is one of the greatest movies of all time, with groundbreaking (for the time) effects, excellent cinematography, editing, action sequences, puppetry, sets, costumes and battles. Likewise, the sound effects are wonderful.The performances include memorable turns from James Earl Jones, Frank Oz, Mark Hamill, Carrie Fisher, Harrison Ford and Anthony Daniels.Some consider it superior to the original Star Wars (A New Hope), and they may have a point. It is darker, more intriguing, delivers an excellent twist, and ends on the edge of a cliff. However, the spectacle didn't awe me on the same level as the original. This is not the fault of the sequel, as it simply came second, and much like a junkie chasing their first high, I never quite achieved the same feeling.(This review is for the original theatrical release and not the special edition)"

alekspredator87,"Jul 21, 2022",9/10,"""New Hope"" showed the whole world that fiction can be adventurous, fun, and new worlds, as George Lucas showed, need further disclosure. A new film was needed that would continue the story of the confrontation between a small army of rebels and an unshakable and gloomy Empire led by Darth Vader. The fans got such a movie.The very title reveals the essence of the upcoming conflict. The Empire and its Death Star had suffered a crushing defeat, which meant that a retaliatory strike was needed, a step that would make the rebels lose. And this film perfectly demonstrates how the stakes are rising in this legendary confrontation.The main characters have matured noticeably, they have grown up, become more serious. Their characters are perfectly shown in the events that surround them. It seems that the actions in the previous movie were like a starting point. Now each of the heroes chooses his own unique path. Luke Skywalker, as the main character, decides to become what he did not think a few years ago - a Jedi, a warrior of light, who once and for all must defeat evil in the person of Vader and Emperor Sidious, who is still flashing in the background. Obi-Wan Kenobi's self-sacrifice seems to have made him an adult overnight, made him feel indebted to this old teacher. And then Luke accepts this burden of fate, intending to fight to the last.Leia Organa and Han Solo are testing the strength of their fragile relationship so far, they do not want to give in to each other. All this happens against the background of the struggle with the imperial armies and a series of betrayals, when it turns out that friends can no longer be trusted. In the maelstrom of events, news comes under the finale, which is now fashionable to call a ""twist"". This is an event that turns out unexpectedly, something that turns the whole narrative upside down or vice versa. The history of Star Wars was probably one of the first to show this technique in the cinema. This is remembered for many years, and the play of the actors (those who saw it will understand which actor and what situation I'm talking about) amazes with its sincerity and literally makes the audience tremble from the discovery that happened.However, this seemingly gloomy picture is not devoid of positive interesting moments. Huge Wookiees, droids and ridiculous situations allow you to dilute this tragic story of one family.The creators of the picture skillfully use the technologies available at that time, which enable viewers to see and, most importantly, believe in the reality of those worlds that are shown to us on the screen. All this is flavored with excellent dialogues, colorful characters and a wonderful musical component. What the Imperial March that appeared here is worth, which for decades will become the personification of the yoke of evil, the approaching dangerous Darth Vader.The creators perfectly show several storylines and interactions between the characters at once. There is a love relationship, and the relationship between mentor and student, a test of friendly feelings. And each of the lines is successfully woven into the overall plot, makes you empathize and see yourself in these diverse characters, understand their motives, agree or not with their opinion.""The Empire strikes back"" makes it possible to leave our native Land and go on an unprecedented journey, makes you throw away your earthly experiences, understand how much brighter and more dynamic life can be, because it is in a galaxy far, far away, where events happened a long time ago. Cinema will allow you to ask a lot of questions about the meaning of life, about relationships, about the world, which is not only black and white. The world is multifaceted, with its own complexities and ambiguity. And, most importantly, this film will encourage you to see the next one, the one that will complete the classic trilogy and finally put all the dots on the ""E"" for these heroes.9 out of 10."

criticalanalyst,"Dec 24, 2019",7/10,"Star Wars: Episode V - The Empire Strikes Back is often described by movie critics and fans as the best Star Wars film of all time. It is undoubtedly a film of its own class.However, I think that this film contains very lengthy and boring sequences, especially in the middle of the film, such as the Dagobah and Bespin scenes. Viewers who are watching this film for the second or third time may find these scenes to be rather long and boring, as they already know is going to happen later on in the film."
SpoodermanDerp,"Dec 14, 2015",N/A,"""Star Wars: Episode V The Empire Strikes Back"" is a great example of expanding on the universe established in the original one, and turn to a more darker tone and direction that adds depth in everyone's beloved characters and of course, tragedy.If Episode IV was an amazing yet simple adventure, Episode V increases the scale and goes deeper into the rich and mysterious universe and characters respectively. Right off the bat, the film starts with one of the best action set pieces in cinema which is the Hoth battle, and once again, the practicality of the whole scene was beautiful and remarkable, the miniatures still aren't as noticeable and still pretty much hold up until today. The imperial walkers were mesmerizing to see in the screen and still holds up compared to CG nowadays. Darth Vader returns and makes one hell of a comeback from a limited amount of screen time last movie. However, the Hoth battle was just an appetizer, there were plenty more to come. As Luke and R2D2 goes to the Dagobah system, he meets Yoda, one of the most beloved Star Wars characters. Han, Leia, Chewie and C3-PO try to escape as the Empire mercilessly hunts them down. As these 2 narratives coincide with each other, the movie gives you more depth and development for each of the characters. Luke learned the way of the Force, Han and Leia developed a relationship that sparked an amazing sense of chemistry between the two. At the end of the film, the two narratives collide and a showdown between Vader and Luke occurs that is both tense and exciting to see. From a suspenseful and chilling duel, it became an emotional ride for both the audience and for our hero. Giving us one of the best twists in cinema history, this film cements its place in our memories and in cinema forever. The dialogue in the film was also brilliant, surprisingly, most of the best and quotable lines came from Yoda and they were executed very well. The choreography for the lightsaber battles were handled way better than before, (especially since they now know that the lightsaber was a great idea after all) and they used it to their advantage. In the end, Star Wars Episode V, is what Star Wars needed, a boost and a different turn that forever places this franchise in our hearts and in our midst. The force is strong in this one."

I hope there are people out there that can agree but I personally would put it at the bottom of the originals and prequels. I just cannot see why people love it so much, there's limited action, a lot of boring scenes and I've always found it to be the weakest star wars film (ignoring the sequels)."
tshikder,"Mar 11, 2017",10/10,"I am a chain si-fi movie watcher. What ever I can remember, Stars Wars is the base of all science Fiction movie from Hollywood. All of these things come into play in my position, but I'm mostly analyzing my picks on the effect they had on me, both when I actually formerly viewed them and today. As always, I actually appreciate your feedback in the section below, but most of all, would want to see your rating of the films. With out further delay, on to the list"
craigconoley,"Jun 11, 2023",10/10,"When I was six, two incredibly creative ladies, a mother and daughter babysitting duo named Phillise and Mary Frances, not only introduced me to the imaginative art of Michael Whelan, but they also screened for me my very first vhs; The Empire Strikes Back.To say this experience was life changing is no understatement, especially now as I watch the film again at 40. In fact, it's themes, archetypes and narrative, are even more relatable now as someone even further along their own story.Cinephiles such as yourself, will know, that George Lucas crafted something in consult with his friend and professional academic Joseph Campbell.Joseph John Campbell (March 26, 1904 - October 30, 1987) was an American writer. He was a professor of literature at Sarah Lawrence College who worked in comparative mythology and comparative religion. His work covered many aspects of the human experience and his best-known work is his book 'The Hero with a Thousand Faces' (1949), in which he discusses his theory of the journey of the archetypal hero shared by world mythologies, termed the monomyth.So at the root of the Star Wars story, one still growing with shows like Andor and a new slate under the guidance of Dave Filony and George Lucas once again , is a notion that perhaps this film has the clout and revere it does because the creators succeeded at hiding the vegetables in the cheese in a way no other film has and with such meaningful permanence.The subtext of the film, if open to the idea that films have a subtext and social historical context, is that the Director and writer were performing the age old ritual of offering up a universal story to a scared village. Story serves this purpose in its many forms, including cinema. It brings us together in community so we can escape from the trauma of reality and basked in allegorized aslects if life, projected up on the screen in the same way shamans told and still tell stories by fire or projector light.As you get older and life begins to offer up new existential buffets of fear and death, The Empire Strikes Back, and its tone, plot, themes, performances, lighting, score and subtext, seem to take on even greater meaning. Perhaps the most poignant being the portrayal of things that do actually happen to families and people who living in worlds where empires and villains and there choices can test the individual psyche in ways only Luke Skywalker could know.For me, dealing with the 7 month decline of my mother with brain cancer and witnessing the lack of care and resources for her before and during the pandemic, felt like I was up against evil forces far greater than me. The test of seeing her suffer in a broken healthcare system in crisis, and then being placated by administrators, doctors, nurses and ceos aware of the resource issues and poor care but unable to agree or admit and unwilling to do anything about it, pit me in a psychological battle that tested my wits and strength in ways that made me the worse version of myself, one who was angry. The struggle to deal with anger, much like Anakin Skywalker and Luke Skywalkers, is the struggle to deal with emotions in the face of injustice, but not just any injustice, injustice that claims one's family.If we look at the present state of the world, one cannibalizing itself in misinformation, political scandal, war, environmental collapse, mental health crisis, the disappearance of the middle class, the rise of fanaticism, the phenomenon of mass shootings, broken healthcare and education systems, nuclear proliferation, pandemics, and perhaps the greatest threat, the unregulated advance and public experiment of A. I., well it certainly does seem like age of evil empires and heroes up against unspeakable odds and bad actors.This is why at 40, with all that's happened since I first watched the film at 6, the story continues to gains in importance and meaning. Yes it's just a silly space opera, but it also represents every persons own struggle against forces they cannot control. Welding the force represents obtaining balance, and in real life, balance is a myth. We all want to be Jedi's, we all want our families to just be safe and get along, we all want to be loved, we all want to live on as force ghosts, and we all want an Ewok baby to cuddle."
Giugi1101,"Jul 11, 2022",9/10,"Second chapter that can be defined as a transition between the first and the last, is a chapter full of plot but in any case of passage, useful only for the construction of the final phase of the saga."
Zeyders,"Mar 31, 2025",8/10,"The fifth Star Wars episode, which was the second in the universe. For its time, there is a lot of action here, which is done to the best of its ability to realize.The film is not much, but probably better than the fourth episode, the first film in the universe. The fighting scenes are better and more exciting, there is more action. The graphics have improved, though of course you can see how they did it.If you watched the first three episodes of Star Wars, then one of the characters will seem silly with a changed character, but this is known only in comparison and can hardly be called a flaw, so I think that the character in the first three episodes would be more suitable without such a strange development in the fifth. Also, sometimes you can hear musical splices, but it's a minor thing.It's an improvement on the first film as a whole. With its famous quotes and scenes. If it wasn't for the cinematography contribution and the year it was made, I'd rather rate it a 7 out of 10 rather than an 8 out of 10."
