acedj,"Nov 15, 2019",9/10,"This is the first movie in the Indiana Jones series. It is also the best film in the series. Indy is hired by the US government to track down the sacred arc of the covenant. While he is on his quest the Nazis are also searching for the arc. This is a wonderful adventure story that covers many countries. Harrison Ford was born to play this role, and he does it with flair. After having seen this film quite a few times, you also get to pick out the Easter eggs that are scattered around. One hint is be on the lookout for two well known Star Wars droids.
I do not think that there was a better combination in the 80's than Lucas and Spielberg. This in everything you would want from an adventure movie and more."
fernandoschiavi,"Jun 27, 2020",8/10,"It was born from the minds of some of the leading filmmakers of the moment, but an adventure that would become one of the leading film franchises. George Lucas had just created and launched two sci-fi classics with the first two chapters of the ""Star Wars"" saga while Spielberg was also already considered one of the most promising directors in Hollywood having effect astonishing successes with ""Jaws (1975)"" and Close Encounters of the Third Kind (1977) "".Classic recipe for matinees adored by George Lucas, the work of screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan is one of the most consistent doing an excellent job of keeping to the basics: virtually all characters in The Raiders of the Lost Ark are based on archetypes, but none of them lack personality. Indy himself is one of the most famous characters in American cinema, fitting the profile of the classic action hero, but with several peculiarities that make him special, from his acid sense of humor, his clumsy way to achieve a goal and also his intelligence. All villains are purposefully shallow and Manichean, with Nazism incorporating all the evil on Earth in a cartoonish way, but that never sounds strange in this proposal.In ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", Spielberg makes his first openly action movie, even though ""Duel"", ""Jaws"" and ""1941"" had their setpieces there, here is a popcorn adventure from start to finish, and this is a category in which the filmmaker would become an expert. The opening scene alone is a lesson in how to introduce a character and his universe, with Spielberg's camera keeping a mystery about Indy's identity - Douglas Slocombe's photograph skillfully covers Ford's face with shadows - but building your personality and your iconic figure through frames that portray your courage and demonstrate your skills; see the closed planes of the hat, the leather jacket and the whip on the long belt before the protagonist draws it against an attacker. It is an aesthetic care and well elaborated by the filmmaker's camera game, which is maintained throughout the film's other numerous action sequences. Between shootings in bars, races to stop a truck and a fist fight on an airstrip, what most charm the project is the ability of the filmmaker to create an atmosphere of tension that embarks on a frantic and good-natured adventure. is one of the great strengths of the feature, guaranteeing the film never to lose its rhythm, while the characters go over obstacle after obstacle, as in a real board game. Spielberg's ability to command the action is present in the most ""naive"" scenes, such as the snake pit or the fight in the Nazi plane, even in the most elaborate ones, such as the chase of trucks involving Jones and several soldiers.Classic backstage story, it was Harrison Ford's suggestion that Indy, when faced by a skilled swordsman in the Cairo market, simply shoot his opponent instead of starting an elaborate fight with his whip - as the script originally said. A sensational improvisation that came out of the mere fact that Ford and several members of the team were sick because of the heat and the local food, and that perfectly ended up defining one of Indy's personality traits. Throughout two other action scenes, the hero ""asks"" an opponent to wait while he prepares to return to the fight, and casually answers one of his colleagues who asks him what his plan is: ""I don't know, I invent on the way"". Priceless phrases and actions, and that only Harrison Ford would be able to deliver with such charisma and naturalness, in what is definitely the most striking role of his remarkable career. Ford is loose, unlike what he commonly complained of Han Solo here he can show some more facets and not a predominant one as is the extremely obvious scoundrel antihero. He is incredulous that the journey he will take will result in something really in the encounter with something divine in fact, in addition to being able to represent well the teacher for whom his students sigh, besides of course to reproduce the cliché of forbidden love for someone of the past, In this case, Marion, the strong and feminine character of Karen Allen, a woman who is clearly not a full-time damsel in distress.With special care for the action, what is also striking is how Spielberg maintains his same technical eye for the most expository scenes. For example, the scene where Indy and Brody (Denholm Elliott) are approached by government officials, and the archaeologist explains the Ark of the Covenant myth to them, Spielberg films much of the dialogue in an open plan with all four characters there, well-disposed through a mise en scène that puts the agents - and the spectator - in a classroom, where Indy even uses the blackboard to present some concepts that will become important in the future; an exhibition that does not sound forced, after all the protagonist is in fact a teacher. We also see Spielberg's brand developing, where the filmmaker works on long shots that always change the characters' positions and the graceful movement of the camera, giving the strong impression that a cut has happened, but remaining in the same shot. Iconography is also a factor that Spielberg and Slocombe masterfully explore, as in the scene where Indy visits Marion in her bar, casting a giant shadow on the girl, but being Marion a fearless woman - and the most memorable one in the archaeologist's gallery - she is very capable of opposing the presence of Indy, and the shadow soon fades over the course of the conversation.The master of Star Wars songs, conductor John Williams had already been working with Spielberg since ""Jaws"", and not tired of delivering memorable themes, he reaches one of the culminations of his career with the Indiana Jones musical piece. It is a cheerful, adventurous and even flashy theme, which summarizes all the feelings and themes of the franchise, as well as offering emotionally demarcated tracks, such as the love theme with Marion and the most oppressive and heavy orchestra to portray the Nazis. Another work of genius, for a change.Being an example of the 80s, and literally beginning the decade, the overwhelming majority of the special effects of Hunters are done in a practical way, being done in the studio, unlike the digital effects so common today. It is very good that Spielberg did not like his friend George Lucas who adapted the effects of Star Wars for the ""current times"" which would be to deny the nature of the film and the time in which it was made. The snake scene was made with real snakes (and that scene with a cobra was filmed with a cobra between a glass panel and the actor. The giant ball at the beginning is actually a giant ball, and the scene where Indiana Jones is dragged by a car was filmed that way, with some stuntmen obviously, but Harrison Ford himself was dragged by the car at one point. We have rubber dolls and animatronics to serve as the dead henchmen, while the need for a more supernatural practically takes the film on a path of trash terror. Anyone who watched the film as a child is forever scarred by the images of Nazis having their faces twisted, exploded and melted when the Ark demonstrates the magnitude and horror of its power, and Spielberg and his team have fun here. Okay, the matte paintings and projections of the ""spirits"" of the Ark are images that today appear considerably dated, but still have an impact, as well as the wonderful eighth of the Nazi Ernst Toht (Ronald Lacey) literally melting before our eyes.One of the great films of Spielberg's career and one of the greatest adventure films of all time. The film, despite being a big blockbuster, still has personal traits of the director who is Jewish, so don't think that the Nazis are villains by chance. Spielberg prints in Caçadores gains a strong and constant critical sub-text that enriches the cinematographic experience, combining narrative lightness with very strong ""strikes"" against the most murderous regime of the 20th century. It is almost like a form of indoctrination in which a certain political position was instilled in the subconscious without our realizing it.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" borders on perfection, as it shows that the academic or scientific search can evidently solve some mysteries, while so many others are apparently instituted to be solved with time and investigations that will last for the lives and generations of many scholars, and this feeling gains even more strength with the scene that precedes the credits, where you see a shed with numerous artifacts kept, all waiting to star in one or more adventures of Indiana and yours.With all these elements well balanced - including a predilection for fantasy - ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" became one of the biggest commercial successes in cinema history, competing for eight Oscars and taking four, starting a millionaire franchise and also generating several imitations. We witnessed a perfect adventure film here, being one of the most dignified and perfect examples that the genre has ever seen. Indiana Jones is already born an iconic figure, thanks to the good ideas of George Lucas and the technical virtuosity of Steven Spielberg, who delivers his first great action film in a fun and intelligent way, using the nostalgia of a very specific period to create something completely new."
Nazi_Fighter_David,"Jul 27, 2008",9/10,"Ford stars as Indiana Jones, an archaeologist adventurer, who spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasureslike the priceless long-lost Ark of the Covenant (the Hebrew sacred artifact that held the supposed Ten Commandments). Unfortunately, a group of treasure-hungry Nazis wants it too, having heard that any army who wins it would receive supernatural powersWith his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol for backup, our stubborn, intelligent, determined and loyal hero escapes innumerable dangers, evades multiple obstacles including fearsome thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a road These are only some of the film's incredible set pieces Steven Spielberg likable hero is not invincible, though, facing impossible odds, capable of getting beaten, struck violently, heart broken, and falling asleep after the first kissThe villainsespecially Indy's suave and cultured French rival wearing a Panama hat and white suits, Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman)are not really that much different from him, except in their motivation The shrill heroine, Marion (Karen Allen)is not the girl always in discomfort either, but a resourceful, dynamic and formidable woman who doesn't require the hero at all""Raiders of the Lost Arc"" is a perfect package of unforgettable scenes, countless action, humor, astonishing technical effects, thrilling sequences, and terrific performances It was followed by three fun sequels"
belzebuebchen,"Dec 6, 2004",10/10,"Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.Of course the story isn't waterproof, the Nazi weren't that present in Egypt in 1936 and how did Indy survive that ride on the submarine again? But lots of good and variable action scenes are accompanied by a story that develops fast and excitingly and is always close to being implausible but luckily never is.Spielberg, Lucas and most of all Harrison Ford created a hero that is nowadays iconic. With their attempt to make an homage to adventure comics of the 1930's they created their own legend.It's funny, exiting, thrilling and romantic. What more can you ask for?"
baumer,"Jul 9, 1999",10/10,"It is a hot sunny day in South America. We see a bunch of men, shot mostly from the back. They are walking deep into the forest. We see a tall dark figure. He is wearing an old leather jacket, he has the 5 o'clock shadow looking like it's closer to midnight, he wears a fedora and he carries a bull-whip ( yes a bull-whip ). Finally, two of the men enter a cave and we hear about some guy named Forstall, who was good, very, very good, but he never came out of the place alive. But they enter anyway. They are confronted with tarantulas, spears that are triggered by blocking out the light, a pit that they must swing over and then more tiny poisonous darts that come out of the wall. All this to protect an ancient gold statue. They recover it. One guy dies and the other barely makes it out of the room before it all falls on him. Then he has to get out of the cave and a giant boulder chases him. Finally he makes it out of the cave only to be surrounded by Hovitos and his arch enemy named Belloq. He takes the gold statue that this guy worked so hard for and then the guy runs and makes it to the plane where he is in the passenger seat and there is big snake in the plane. He hates snakes. This mans name? Indiana Jones!Whhhoooooo!! I'm left breathless just describing that opening. But is there a better beginning of a movie ever? Absolutely not. Does the beginning have anything to do with the rest of the film. No. It is all decoration for what the movie is going to put you through in the 90 minutes to come.Indiana Jones is the best character to ever hit the screens. And he better be. He is created by George, Steven and played by Harrison Ford. That may seem normal now that we have lived with him for 20 years, but can you imagine what that must have been like back in 1981. That would be like Tom Hanks or Will Smith joining forces with James Cameron and Steven Spielberg for a completely original idea in today's terms.Raiders took a simple idea and maybe an idea that the guys had from watching Saturday afternoon movies and made it larger than life. This film never stops for you to take your breath. It is filled with rich characters from Indy himself to Marion to Belloq and even to Marcus Brody. Each has their own personality that shines through in certain scenes. Some of my faves were when we first meet Marion having a shot contest in her bar in Nepal. Then there is her scene with Belloq and they get drunk together and she tries to leave using only a butter knife. And of course who can forget Indy's battle with the swordsman and his unrivaled determination to get the ark. "" Indy, there is not time. If you still want the truck it is being loaded on a truck for Cairo. "" ( a battered and bloody Indy ) "" Truck? What truck?"" ( and then later ) ""Get some transport back to England, boat, plane, anything. Meet me at Omar's. I'm going after that truck. ""Sola ) "" How? "" ( Indy ) I don't know I'm making this up as I go.""Raiders has more energy than three action films. And that is what makes it the classic that it is. If you like movies, then Raiders is a movie that will not let you down. It is pure entertainment and that is indisputable. It finds the youngster in all of us and bombards us with this silly, whip-cracking, average, incredibly determined archaeologist and only asks us to have fun. And that we do. And to me, the only reason that Chariots of Fire won best picture that year is because it is a serious film. Raiders was heads and shoulders above Chariots and it should have cleaned up at the Oscars in 81. But more politics with the academy.Raiders of the Lost Ark is the epitome of entertainment. What more can be said about it. If you haven't seen this movie in a while or if you haven't seen it at all ( gasp ) then do yourself a favour and rent it tonight. It is awesome.TRUST ME"

PyrolyticCarbon,"Dec 24, 2004",10/10,"I remember seeing this movie when I was young, and it may well have been in the cinema with my Father, I can't quite remember (if he does, then please post the answer), anyway I do remember seeing it and being thoroughly entertained and that feeling of excitement and total fun staying with me to this very day as that is the feeling that the movie conjures up whenever I think of it.I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 12, 2023",10/10,"There is no denying, that this film will forever be one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. Ahead of watching the newest Indie movie, I decided to go straight back to the first one, it's been some time since I last saw it, but it is as still fresh, exciting and downright fun as I remember.The plot is pretty wild, to reach the prized artefact, Indie has to battle through all manner of dangers, battling Nazis in the process, it sounds outlandish and outrageous, but it works.I'd still regard it as Harrison Ford's defining role, he is a huge character, Indie is a real free spirit, he's funny, daring, charming and captivating, the eternal adventurer, perhaps the reason he's back forty years on.Raiders of The Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones, and arguably the best, although I also love Temple of Doom.The perfect film for a bank holiday evening, or teatime on boxing day, it's an adventure that has something for the whole family.Expect some amazing action sequences, this has some impressive fight sequences, explosions, chases, it really is a visual feast, I'm so glad it was made before cinema was captured by The CGI wizards (not that I'm taking away from what those guys do,) but the action feels real.Four decades on, and it's still an exciting, action packed thrill ride, but then you know that already.10/10."
shanrock-33046,"Apr 4, 2022",10/10,"From an Amazing cast that give you a great story of the old fashion action, adventure, love, comedy plot. It is a good movie with great photography. This is a movie that you will surely not want to ever miss."
snoozejonc,"Aug 27, 2020",10/10,"Archaeologist-Adventurer Indiana Jones hunts for the ancient Ark of the Covenant.This movie is a spectacular introduction to one of the most iconic action heroes of twentieth century cinema. It has one of the greatest opening sequences of all time and follows it up with a plethora of classic cinematic moments.We have a McGuffin based plot moving through a variety of locations, encountering a rival archaeologist and hordes of Nazis hell bent on eliminating Indy and taking the Ark for themselves.Harrison Ford is a mixture of Bond and Bogart with his expressive face and rugged charm, while Karen Allen makes a combative and confrontational leading lady. ""You b*****ds! I'll get you for this"" Marion shouts at an entire platoon of Nazis. The two display excellent screen chemistry. One great aspect is the change in attitude we see from Indy towards Marion as the film progresses. Initially it's all about the Ark but by the end it's a bit more about her. Perhaps this is what saves him from the same fate as the film's antagonists.Visually it has the feel of classics like Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Yojimbo. Spielberg has also borrowed and updated action sequences from the likes of Zorro and Stagecoach to great effect. Particularly impressive are the use of shadows in several sequences, my favourite being when the Ark is first carried out of its burial site. All of it is edited so that the noisey excitement is complimented by quieter moments that are just as memorable.Spielberg's anger towards the Nazis rises to the surface in one of the film's themes covering good and evil. Images like the burning swastika and the wrath of god witnessed at the film's conclusion are examples of the Ark punishing those who have broken the covenant held within.John Williams gave the film one of his finest scores and it makes every frame that bit more special. Seeing Indy swinging from jungle vines, chasing a truck on horseback and swimming on to a German U-boat would not be the same without that famous tune to give it that air superhuman confidence.This launched a franchise for Lucas and Spielberg but it was never bettered or even equalled by any of the adventures that followed."
xenophil,"Jun 9, 1999",6/10,"Everyone else seems to love this movie, so I guess I have to be the one to 'dis' it.  I really don't understand why it is so popular.   I really enjoy a good adventure, but I like it to be more than a quarter inch deep.It was so continuously noisy that I had to turn the volume down.   The music was bombastic and grating.  People die like flies.  The protagonists gaily wreak havoc with no apologies.  There is no psychology or character.  The hero is brave - a cheap virtue since he's obviously invulnerable.   The cultural icons dragged in to lend an exotic tone were given the most superficial treatment - everything was a throwaway, but none of it was stylish, witty or funny.  We are talking about a cartoon - except lots of cartoons are more sophisticated and better developed.I can see that the idea is to evoke a golden age of imperialism where we are excused from the duty to care about history, culture and religion, or to feel bad about archaeological piracy, mass murder, ethnic stereotypes, shoddy scholarship, etc. etc. and can just have some good clean fun.  But with all this freedom, what is the fun?   Knocking over piles of blocks like a three-year-old and punching the bad guy in the nose.The movie is a pastiche - almost every scene is borrowed.  The cultural vein of nostalgia that is being mined is old -obsolete - adventure fiction. If we could see most of this fiction now we would probably find it childish and dated - we know more about the world now.  The trick is to make us forget that so we can enjoy our nostalgia.Do people really need permission to regress this badly?"
Li-1,"Jul 16, 2003",N/A,"Rating: **** out of ****There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie series in the history of cinema. And the one start it all was Raiders of the Lost Ark, a fast-paced adventure packed with one death-defying cliff-hanger situation after another. To this day, Raiders remains one of the best action movies, holding up better than most of today's rapid-cut, MTV-style ""thrill rides."" Raiders relied on no CGI, no flashy editing, just pure, exhilarating film-making and storytelling, a combo of its kind that has only been surpassed by its second sequel, Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade.Harrison Ford stars as Jones, an archaeologist who dresses in a brown coat and fedora, armed with a revolver and lion-taming whip. A delightful opening involving elaborate booby traps informs us he's used to these adventures (especially his even closer brushes with death in Temple of Doom, which was a prequel). When he returns to the states from his latest ""excavation,"" he's informed by the military that the Nazis are after the ark of the covenant, an artifact that could possess the power to make the Nazis an invincible army. So Jones sets out to retrieve the ark first, in what will prove to be one of his greatest adventures.There's probably little doubt that Raiders is the fan/critical favorite of the trilogy, but there are a few things that I actually have to gripe about, blasphemous as it may be. For one, even though the story is excellent, it's not without its holes. Most perplexing is in the film's opening scenes, when we wonder why Jones bothered to bring along potentially traitorous porters when it's such a short distance from the river to the cave temple. Also (spoilers), one needs only to see the film once to realize that if Indy had never tried to intercept the Ark, the Nazis would a) have never found it or b) still would have suffered the same horrible fate regardless.The action sequences are superb, though an early bar shootout isn't quite as adrenaline-pumping as it could be and looks quite bland compared to the film's other action scenes. Thankfully, the following street chase is playful and exciting and keeps the joyous momentum flowing. Overall, I'd still argue that both Temple of Doom and The Last Crusade boast more inventive action but there's no questioning that the action scenes in Raiders are fantastic and likely superior to any film you may have seen the last few years.As bitchy as I may sound, I'm not trying to harp on Raiders, at least not too much. The movie does feature the famous (and deservedly so) truck chase, one of the most unbelievably thrilling and exhilarating action setpieces I've ever seen (and given an extra boost by John Williams' beautifully rousing score). To this day, even with the recent chase scenes in The Matrix Reloaded and Terminator 3, this sequence has yet to be surpassed.Other standout sequences include a sarcophagus almost entirely decorated with snakes, imposing statues, and well-preserved mummies, and Jones' mano-a-mano battle with a seemingly impervious Nazi mechanic. The finale takes the film dangerously close to the horror genre, climaxing things with a truly memorable (and quite frightening) light show for the ages. Every Indiana Jones film has a scene that scarred me as a kid and I think every one who's seen Raiders knows what I'm referring to (as well as its sequels)I've said it before, Harrison Ford is wonderful as Jones, embodying a hero that's cool beyond words, yet still entirely human and believable. The supporting cast isn't as up to par: Paul Freeman makes for a decent but not particularly menacing villain as Belloq and Karen Allen is somewhat annoying as Indy's love interest, but there are an equal share in gems, particularly Denholm Elliot as Marcus Brody and John Rhys-Davies as Sallah (The Last Crusade wisely gave these actors/characters more screen time).Raiders of the Lost Ark was revolutionary cinema, paving way for summer blockbusters that would attempt for the same winning mix of thrills and humor. Only its sequels matched and/or surpassed it, but some have actually come close (The Mummy). If you haven't seen Raiders yet, put it on the top of your list."
0U,"Feb 23, 2020",10/10,"This movie has it all, action, romance, comedy, giant boulders and occult seeking Nazis. Story conceived by George Lucas and screenplay written by the same guy that wrote Empire Strikes Back and Return of the Jedi. If that doesn't sell it, then look no further than Steven Spielberg because he directed it. Awesome movie all around and definitely a genre classic. An absolute must see for any movie fan that likes fun."
ToldYaSo,"Feb 27, 1999",10/10,"If you've seen this movie and heard the score, then my one line summary won't read like a mating call for sheep, but rather the absolutely exhilarating ""Raider's March"" which stirs my blood and makes me think of an unforgettable hero, Indiana Jones. If not, see it now.I love going to movies. I always have. I remember when this film came out. My friends had seen it before I had. They boasted it was great, the best film ever. Some even said it was better than Star Wars (utter blasphemy to a devout 10 year old Jedi-wannabe). I thought no way is this film better than Star Wars, but I was still curious and began the begging of my father to take me.When I was young, almost all of the films that I had seen, I saw with my Dad. He would take me and my mother would stay at home with my siblings. We saw a number of films that failed to generate a reaction with him as they did with me, but this one was different. This one, my Dad might've enjoyed just as much.Who can forget the scene where Indy faces bandits in the marketplace, fighting swords with his wits and fists, only to be finally challenged by a dark robed adversary brandishing a heavy, dismembering type of sabre as he swings the impressive blade about his head menacingly?Indiana looks his opponent up and down briefly and draws his pistol casually and shoots the villain dead as if his patience had been tested a moment longer than he could tolerate.My father, and the entire audience for that matter, laughed and cheered at this incredible scene. And it was the first time I'd actually been aware of his enjoyment of the film. Usually I'm so transfixed that I wouldn't notice if my legs were on fire. He enjoyed it so much, that he still tends to bring up that scene, even today.My father and I shared a great moment in movie history, and I will never forget it for as long as I live. I will always be grateful for the time we spent together and the films that I otherwise would have been unable to see without him taking me.Just a side note about the scene I've described above. It wasn't meant to go that  way at all. As Steven Spielberg explained in a television interview, the scene was meant to have an elaborate fight sequence, but Harrison Ford was suffering from diarrhea and couldn't go through with the elaborate set-up required. Someone said, ""the only way we can finish this scene today is if he shoots him"". Steven said, ""Wait a minute, we might have something there.""As for where it ranks with Star Wars, it's hard for me to say, so I won't. Star Wars was the first film I ever saw, and there's a story in that as well. Thanks again, Dad."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Sep 26, 2006",9/10,"I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times on TV, DVD and big screen. My local theatre had a special showing last night and the 400-seat screen completely sold out (as Indy films always do). Luckily for me and my pal, we got the last 2 tickets available! I can't think of many films that still sell-out 25 years after their original release. There's just something about Indy movies(iconic hero, affection, epic spectacle) that brings you back again and again.The only trouble with that is there are zillions of reviews, critiques and dissections of this movie already out there, so what I have to offer will probably not be anything new. I will however not go the way of the cliché and mention 1930's serials, Tom Selleck or the sword/gun fight.I will, however, ask you one question. Did you know that some of the more iconic, memorable sequences from Raiders owe quite a lot to Duck Tales? What? Surely it's the other way around? Well, no. The globe-trotting adventures of Scrooge McDuck, Huey, Duey, Luey and Donald in Carl Bank's Disney comic-books from the 50s came first. If you can find some of these then you'll surely notice the similarities.The hunt for the Ark of the Covenant is more than just an excuse for action. So many movies these days seem to come up with action first and string them together with some lame plot. Movies like this are quickly forgotten and one of the reasons Raiders holds up so well is because it works the Covenant story so well into the plot.The action comes in a succession of set-pieces. I do enjoy films that have to increasingly better themselves in every scene. Raiders introduced this as a standard that the sequels had to live up to. My fave scene has to be the massive truck chase through Egypt, which is made up of many of its own smaller sequences. One little idiosyncrasy I like about Indy is that even though he's a College Professor and Doctor, he has no beef killing people. So very far from the ubiquitous PC heroes of todays movies.You might think that it's rather geeky to hype up the editing and sound design, but they do stand out from recent action movies. The gunfire and punching seem to have a sort of 'Indy' signature sound to them, that I've not heard in any other films. And obviously, John William's classic score is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows (though I prefer his score to Temple of Doom), truly one of the best movie themes ever. Better than Star Wars!I'm not sure if Spielberg planned on Raiders starting the Indy franchise but there's already enough in here to establish a whole universe of potential stories and character arcs. There's talk of a fourth movie at the moment, but I personally don't think it will happen and I don't want it to. It's perfect existing as a trilogy and a sequel that comes traipsing in 18 years after the last is just not going to feel right. Even if you are hungry for more Indy then there are loads of books and video games out there and then there's the Young Indiana Jones TV show (where are the DVDs?), which are official Indy canon and even starred Ford once (they bounced around in time).I am giving Raiders 9/10 because I just have a soft spot for Temple of Doom (which is obviously a 10/10 movie). Even 25 years after it first came out it still has the power to captivate the audience and provoke sheer excitement every time. And in 25 years it will still be far superior to almost everything.Now there's something you cannot say about The Fast and the Furious! Sigh, where did all the special movies go?"
Xstal,"Jun 6, 2022",9/10,"An army of fascists seek to plunder, an artefact so precious it's a wonder, an archaeologist will resist, using whips and guns and fist, in a treasure of a film packed with adventure.There are puzzles to be solved and riddles broken, the dialogue's a joy, beautifully spoken, action packed from start to end, returns a massive dividend, engaging all the way and thought provoking."
masonsaul,"Nov 25, 2021",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an amazing and deservedly iconic action adventure with plenty of classic lines, superb performances and phenomenal action set pieces that are tense and thrilling. In paying tribute to the classic adventure serials, it creates a timeless blockbuster that's endlessly entertaining.Harrison Ford gives an amazing lead performance. He's funny, charming and dashing but there's also a palpable exhaustion that really humanises him, reminding you he isn'tinvulnerable. He's supported by Karen Allen who's just as capable and Paul Freeman plays a villain you love to hate.Steven Spielberg's direction is superb. There's a subtlety to the extended takes that almost go unnoticed and the action scnes have a beautiful rhythm to them. John Williams' score is perfect, one of the best in all of cinema with an instantly recognisable theme thats so triumphant and with a perfect sense of adventure."
patboldt,"Feb 27, 2018",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, the first of the Indiana Jones trilogy and definitely the best. This movie redefined what an action adventure movie could and should be. After the epic Horror Adventure that is Jaws comes the epic action adventure, Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. This movie easily deserves 10 stars for it's sheer innovation, directing, visuals, and entertainment ability. Here's why.Harrison Ford is a perfect choice for the awesome hero, Indiana Jones. An archaeologist who dreams of fortune and glory, he embarks on an adventure to find the Ark of the Covanent and save it from the Nazis. Harrison Ford is perfect in this role and it's so refreshing to see a badass hero that everybody can root for simply because he's awesome and embodies everything we want from an adventurer. Every moment of him is simply cinematic gold and it makes him shine against everyone else, even himself as Han Solo. That's not to say that the supporting actors aren't great, they are, but he's the main character and he steals the show which he should.Steven Spielberg really went out of his way with this masterpiece. The practical effects and stuntwork isn't just phenomenal, it's almost godlike! The action is jaw dropping in its awesomeness to the point where it almost doesn't even look like a movie, it looks like a portal into somebody else's universe: Spielberg's universe. What visual effects that are used are so good that it makes modern day action flicks look like stupid college projects that got F's. Michael Bay ain't got nothing on Golden Age Spielberg! Every scene screams with action and it just gets better and better all the way through but it never forsakes the story in place of action. Modern day directors need to take notes from this movie.Once somebody watches this movie, you soon find yourself in a trance in which you can never get sick of it. Nobody can get sick of Indiana Jones, it's not possible. Go watch this movie and you will be very pleased. Or just listen to the Golden John Williams music, that works too."
r96sk,"Apr 16, 2020",7/10,"'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is a good film, but nothing more than that for me.Harrison Ford does a sterling job as Indiana Jones, even if his performance does constantly remind me of Steve Martin for some reason. John Rhys-Davies, who I like in James Bond's 'The Living Daylights', fits in well as Sallah. Apart from those two, I don't think any of the others have anything major/memorable about them here - I would've liked to have seen more of Ronald Lacey's Toht.The adventure side is enjoyable, though everything else is missing a spark in my opinion; a lot of the plot devices are convenient and predictable. The special effects are solid though, as is the score by John Williams.It makes for a fun enough watch, even if I did expect better."
baslanters,"Aug 19, 2018",10/10,"This movie has everything: action, a good cast, humor, a wonderful soundtrack (John Williams) a good pace and a good script. I watch this movie like 2 or 3 times a year and it still fascinates me. Thank you for this masterpiece mr. Spielberg! They don't make movies like this anymore!"
bob the moo,"Jan 14, 2002",N/A,"In the run up to WW2 Professor Jones is approached by US Intelligence to recover the lost Ark of the Covenant in order to stop it falling into the hands of the Nazi's.  With bar owner Marion in tow, Indiana takes on Nazi's across the globe to recover the ark.The story is pure Saturday morning hokum, but its all shined up with a great deal of professionalism and you don't notice.  The main strength is the tremendous sense of fun in the film - not only is it funny but the huge action scenes are all edge of the seat stuff that are hugely enjoyable to watch.  Be it the opening set piece, the truck chase, the fight around a burning airplane, the chase for a basket or the gory finish - it's all great fun to watch.The performances are pretty cardboard and stereotype - evil Nazi's et al. but it barely matters.  Ford is great - this is the type of undemanding hero type that he thrives on.  The rest of the cast are good - Freeman and Kahler stand out with their characters.  If it has any weaknesses then the lack of characterisation and plotting are the main suspects but I really think the flaws are greatly outweighed by strengths.Overall a good action film for older families.  With an old fashioned feel, a great sense of fun, plenty of laughs and fantastic action scenes this deserves all the good reviews it gets."
jazzest,"Jul 19, 2004",3/10,"This adventure flick, which mixes the Western movie formula and special effects in their infant days, represents the American mainstream cinema in the early 80s in many ways. The protagonist Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a scholar and an action hero; this combination is unique but the uniqueness has nothing to do with the character development and seems to be the result of the filmmakers' thoughtless decision. The portrayal of the heroine Marion Ravenwood (Karen Allen) is also inconsistent; sometimes she is tough and independent, while frail and dependent on Indiana Jones in the other times. Along with a dragging optimistic story, overly stretched action scenes may be beyond the audience's attention span. The Reaganomix overshadows the plot, where the Americans can do whatever they want in foreign places (South America, Nepal, and Cairo). The sets of Nepal and Cairo look nothing but sets, while John Williams' score, with a catchy melody line by brilliant brass in the Late Romanticism taste, annoyingly accentuates every single action."
donaldsonramsay,"Apr 12, 2022",10/10,It's odd to think that Tom Selleck was the first choice to play Dr Jones. I doubt he'd have brought Harrison Ford's world weariness that I love to the role. Often imitated never bettered I never tire of watching this movie.

Few movies have so much packed into an hour and fifty minutes there's nothing that can be added or taken away.

TheLittleSongbird,"Sep 3, 2010",10/10,"For me it is not only the best of the series but one of the greatest adventure films ever made. It is breathless excitement from start to finish, and to be honest I cannot fault it really. The production values are wonderfully evocative, and John Williams's score is outstanding. The script is filled with wit and invention, and the story is slickly paced and exciting. The action is spine-tingling, with booby-trapped caves, snake chambers, Nazi spies, religious demons, damsels in distress and romance, and the special effects are dazzling especially in the superb climax. The direction is effortless, and there is little to complain about the acting either. The part of the unorthodox archaeologist fits Harrison Ford like a glove and Paul Freeman brilliantly plays a smooth villain. Karen Allen, Denholm Elliot and John Rhys-Davies are excellent as well. In conclusion, brilliant and if you haven't seen it do. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
iggy-92588,"Mar 19, 2022",10/10,Simply the best adventure/action movie of all time. Have nothing to say But perfect. Exiting and amazing through out the whole movie. Harrison Ford plays the role Indiana Jones amazingly. George Lucas and steven Spielberg did an amazing job as well and for me this is the best movie out of the whole Indiana Jones trilogi.
cricketbat,"Jun 30, 2020",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an adventure classic. Harrison Ford is fantastic as the whip-bearing, hat-wearing hero, Indiana Jones, and the story is full of entertaining twists and turns. This has long been a favorite film of mine, and I am happy that I was able to pass the legacy along to my children-who were only mildly traumatized by the face-melting scene."
bigboybhatia,"Jan 1, 2004",6/10,"I have finally seen Raiders of the Lost Ark, after having seen the last 2 parts of the trilogy some years ago.  I was quite disappointed overall.  The opening was entertaining and strong, but then the movie fell into a horribly boring sequence.  It picks up again during the truck chase sequence, before leaving us with a ridiculously supernatural ending.  That was a let-down for a movie where everything else was reasonably realistic.Another point I wanted to mention is I can't see how this movie got a PG-13 rating.  The amount of gratuitous violence is almost overwhelming.  The body count racked up by the end of the movie is probably greater than all of the Friday the 13th movies put together.  Granted, the amount of violence is equal to many action movies out today, but they don't have PG-13 ratings. The camera lingers on mutilated faces, gallons of blood are thrown around, and countless numbers of faceless Arabs and Nazis are killed or injured. Not exactly family material.The few exciting action sequences here save this movie from being a total wreck, but I can't seen any justification for this movie's current position in the top 20 movies of all time.  Maybe the sentimental factor is the reason."
Aaron1375,"Apr 19, 2001",10/10,"There are few movies I can watch over and over again, but this is one of them.  This movie has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. Harrison Ford is at his best as Dr. Jones, one of the most exciting archeologist ever.  From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I love the opening when he as to dodge traps as he tries to get this treasure, I love it when he is running through the streets trying to save the girl, I just love every bit of it.  Spielburg said he wanted a b-type movie like he remembered from his youth, but this far surpasses any b movie and any a movie as far as I am concerned."
BigHardcoreRed,"Feb 1, 2005",N/A,"Here it is, February of 2005 and I had yet to see Raiders Of The Lost Ark (or the other 2 in the trilogy for that matter). For some reason, it did not appeal to me. I did not get into movies until the early '90s and never got around to seeing it. However, upon urging of my friend I decided to rent it. I have to give credit where credit is due. Indiana Jones paves the way for the Tomb Raiders and other various movies of the same type.Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a doctor in archeology who teaches at a college and in his spare time, finds rare artifacts and saves the world from Nazis. In this case, he is trying to find the Ark Of The Covenant, which at one time held the original Ten Commandments that Moses chiseled into the stone tablets. The Nazis, along with help from Jones' arch rival Rene Belloq, are trying to find the Ark for their own purposes. Along the way, Indiana meets up with a woman named Marion (Karen Allen), who he jilted in the past, which is not really explained in this movie but they end up helping each other in the search for the Ark.The special effects and the action in Raiders Of The Lost Ark are exceptional, considering this was made in 1981. It set the bar reasonably high for action/adventure movies, even to this day as many movies are still compared to the Indiana Jones trilogy. It holds up well, considering most of the movies from the early 80's are very dated and hard to watch anymore. 8.5/10"
SpelingError,"Feb 28, 2022",7/10,"Before I start, I might as well address the ""sleeping with underage women"" bit which has gotten some controversy in the past few years. After watching Jones' and Marion's first scene together, I definitely raised an eyebrow at the ""You knew what you were doing"" conversation, and after reading the transcript where Spielberg and Lucas intended for Marion to be 15 and for Jones to be 25 when they had their affair, that aspect of the film stuck out as problematic. Due to that (in addition to Jones being a colonist), I wasn't able to get invested in their friendship and eventual romance. If Jones' arc was of him redeeming himself throughout the film, that would be different, but he instead seemed to be portrayed as noble and charming all throughout.So yeah, couldn't get invested in the characters this viewing. In spite of that, however, I still think this is a solid action film. It has some memorable action scenes (the opening), a couple terrific magical scenes (the God's wrath scene at the end is outstanding, in particular), and its fair share of humor here and there (Jones shooting the swordsman). Back when I was a kid, this film was everything for me. When I rewatched it a couple days ago, however, I found that the love I felt towards the film when I was a kid wore off. This isn't to say the film aged poorly per se (rather, I think the film aged great for the most part). It's just not my kind of film anymore and I'm no longer the target audience for it. Since I've watched a number of films like Battleship Potemkin, Zulu, The Wild Bunch, Apocalypse Now, Hard-Boiled, Saving Private Ryan, etc since then, which have action scenes that are far more engaging and technically outstanding, that may play a part in why my tastes have moved on. Who knows. Still though, I think this is a great gateway film and it would definitely be among my top recommendations for someone new to classic film."
Atreyu_II,"Feb 10, 2008",5/10,"With all due respect for the fans of this movie or any other Indiana Jones movie, but this wasn't what I expected. I found this to be a rather weak adventure film (and I like adventure films) and I personally don't consider this a classic.The reason why this film didn't live up to my expectations is because I was hoping this to be a movie with great adventures and lots of fun, amusement and classic humor - you know, something like ""Romancing the Stone"" and ""The Jewel of the Nile"". Instead, this is much more an action film with too much tedious moments, too much action, too much characters and many annoying ones, too much military patrols and many violence.The soundtrack is cool but there is much better, none of the actors amaze and the story itself isn't all that appealing. There are some good action scenes, but other than that it's not much of a movie."
TeamReCare,"Dec 23, 2021",10/10,"A fun romp around the globe. A movie like this might have saved Quibi, having that ""Cliff Hanger"" every 10 minute on this adventurous story. It is truly a interesting film to watch in the form of how second unit and stunt performers are used in making the full dynamic of the film. Just the horse chase alone, any time you don't see Ford's face is second Unit and Stunt performers. While you can easily point out many flaws in this film, as a whole it is still one of the greats."
lenikut,"Jan 29, 2024",10/10,"Raiders of the lost ark is the brainchild of Steven Spielberg and George Lucas. It follows the archeolog and a part-time teacher - Indiana Jones and his race against Nazis to find the lost ark.Ok, let's start with the script. It's one of the best i've read. It's really fast paced, engaging, fun and thrilling. Also the story by George Lucas is really freaking good.The directing - there is nothing i can say here that hasn't been said before - it's fantastic!The acting is also wonderful. Evrybody is great, especially Harrison Ford as Indiana jones. I can't imagine anybody else as the cool archeologist who fights Nazis and stuff. Karen Allen is also surprisingly good. That's the first movie i saw her in and i was really surpried.It's not gonna be a descent review without talking about the music by the freaking John Williams. Once again, i can't say poop that hasn't been said before - it's amazing!Overall Raiders of the lost ark is what i love about cinema. It continious to inspire me to this day and that is why it's my favourite movie of all time."
ma-cortes,"Aug 15, 2005",8/10,"It's the first part of adventures trilogy , going on the way of the 30s classic films and the Comics-Books language. The picture blends comedy,adventures action,rip roaring,cliff hunger,tongue-in-cheek and is extremely entertaining and fun . The archaeologist Indiana Jones with his bull whip-wielding and hat will confront dastard Nazis (Ronald Lacey) in Peru, Nepal and Egypt to the obtaining the Moiseh ark with the Covenant's tables . He's only helped by two feisty adventurers (Karen Allen and John Rhys Davies) . Indy fights nasty Arabs , decodes hieroglyphics and faces off hundreds of snakes . The movie attempts to go on the path from great classics during the 30-40s and the comic-books narrative along with the special characteristics of the terror cinema of 80 decade.Dr.Indiana executes feats of derring-do in various exotics countries. The action highlights include the opening sequence in a Peruvian jungle temple and the creepy and spooky final, but some scenes aren't for squeamish kids . It's realized in James Bond style and high-adventure and it is driven with enormous , formidable fair-play . This breathtaking movie has a number of scenes that will have you on the edge of your seat, but the action never lets up . The enjoyable screenplay was wonderfully written by George Lucas (film's producer) , Philip Kauffman and Lawrence Kasdan . In the picture there're several exotic locations , cliff-hangers, tongue-in-cheek , daring escapes , rip-roaring , derring-do , it is a very bemusing cinematic roller-coaster ride . It's a throw-back to old-fashioned Technicolor amusement with hints of serial with thousands of dollars in budget .Harrison Ford interprets masterfully the daredevil and brave archaeologist transformed into an action man . Karen Allen plays his untameable and impulsive couple who'll have a little romance with Indy . The movie has great loads of action , special effects galore and the habitual and excellent , as always , John Williams musical core . Dazzling action set-pieces are stunningly mounted by Steven Spielberg . The film has entered the lists of ten most popular of all time . It is followed by ¨Indiana Jones and the Temple of Doom¨ and¨ The last Crusade¨. And by the TV series ,also produced by George Lucas : ¨The young Indiana Jones¨with Sean Patrick Flannery .It's a must see for the adventures fans . Rating : Awesome."

Holt344,"Jun 22, 2023",10/10,"This is a film I grew up with, loved it since my father showed it to me for the first time. Indiana Jones and Star Wars was two of the things I absolutely loved, both are stories of visionary George Lucas. Steven Spielberg directed it and his vision for George Lucas' story and the screenplay written by Lawrence Kasdan, together, they created something truly memorable and remarkable. The Raiders of the Lost Ark is an achievement in the history of cinema. Having grown up with these films, I've seen them numerous of times, except for Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull which is the film I've watched least time and more on that later. It was the first entry in what became the Indiana Jones franchise, which includes four more films; Temple of Doom (1984), Last Crusade (1989), Kingdom of the Crystal Skull (2008), and Dial of Destiny (2023). This review is solely about Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film has a cast of great characters and performances, actors like: Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood, Paul Freeman as René Belloq, Ronald Lacey as Major Arnold Toht, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah and Denholm Elliott as Marcus Brody.In 1936, archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones is hired by the U. S. government to find the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can obtain its awesome powers.Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is like I wrote before, an achievement in cinema, for many reasons. It's mostly remembered and rightfully so because of Steven Spielberg, one of the best directors in the history of film. There's also the musical score by John Williams, it's one of those soundtracks that have gone down as one of the most memorable film music. But of course the lead, Harrison Ford who shows no one else could play the role of Indiana Jones. Ford performed as many of his stunts as was allowed throughout the film, suffering various injuries, he even did the iconic boulder scene ten times which is said to have been dangerous. Harrison Ford shines in every scene, dramatic like comedic but truly shining in the action sequences as he does the majority of stunts himself. There are a lot of good performances in this film, Karen Allen and Paul Freeman are two others. You see, at an older age I actually found René Belloq to be one of the better characters in the film and why's that? He's three dimensional on paper, but needed more screen time to become great, yet here we have an antagonist not evil like Major Arnold Toht who is one-dimensional. Jones and Belloq are on the same level of intellect and the skill of archeology.From the introduction of Indiana Jones in the very first scene to the Peruvian temple sequence and everything else you'll get to see and experience in this fine film. There are multiple locations you get to see in this film, starting with Peru and then Nepal, finally Egypt where the second half takes place. What's so interesting with this film is how it goes from being rated PG to PG-13 and R, but makes it work. I think the well written comedy is a huge part of why that works so well. The comedy is great and most importantly, the actors comedic timing is golden. There are also some more brutal scenes in the film, often the comedy makes it less brutal and this is one of few films which succeeds in that. There's not a single joke which falls flat, one of my favorite ones is said by Marion ""You can't do this to me, I'm an American."", it cracked me up and honestly the comedic writing is ten out of ten, so is the writing. The screenplay and story are brilliantly written. Cinematography is truly spectacular in every way, each shot is shot carefully and with perfection. What else is perfect? The pacing in my opinion, this film is an adventure you just can't get enough of, two hours which just flies away. Non-stop action, the engaging and interesting adventure, but also the performances and characters. There's so much to enjoy, so much which was worked on until it was perfect. Take the sets for an example, they are real and they used practical effects immensely with the boulder for an example. Regarding the sets, for example the Peruvian temple interiors were life-sized. The sets were brilliant, so were the special effects, something worth talking about is the backgrounds and the use of matte paintings. About the realism, in the scene at the Well of Souls, they used hundreds of real snakes, and it became one of the iconic scenes. This film is truly not one for people with phobias for snakes or spiders.I wish I could have seen it at the cinema on June 12, 1981. Steven Spielberg, a director who never made sequels, made sequels for this film. Indiana Jones would never have been made if not for George Lucas with the idea and his good friend Steven Spielberg in the chair, it's nice to see great friends work together to create a masterpiece like this. This is a masterpiece in my eyes, for the critics, it's considered one of the greatest films ever made. Raiders of the Lost Ark became the highest-grossing film of 1981, earning approximately $330.5 million worldwide, and played in some theaters for over a year. Thus a very special film, a film which was selected for preservation in the National Film Registry by The United States Library of Congress. Raiders of the Lost Ark received five Oscars; Best Art Direction, Best Film Editing, Best Sound, Best Sound Editing and Best Visual Effects, and received four other nominations: Best Picture, Best Director, Best Cinematography and Best Original Score. In my opinion, it was a strong contender for those awards as well, especially the director and cinematography ones along with the original score. It also won seven Saturn Awards and one BAFTA, along with other awards. Let me finish my review with a quote from Roger Ebert; ""A series of 'breathless and incredible' adventures inspired by and celebrating childhood stories told in comic books and movies. He concluded the film was successful in its singular goal of entertaining, creating an adventure epic in the vein of Star Wars, the James Bond films, and Superman."" And that it did, creating a franchise and something people now as then finds entertainment in. As part of his The Great Movies series, Ebert said while the special effects had not aged well, they were perfect for this type of film. He concluded it was a ""whiz-bang slamarama"" made with ""heedless joy"". Critics called this an instant classic, it remains a classic but also a masterpiece."
oe-laub,"Dec 26, 2020",10/10,"What are all those freakin' bulls**t reviews with 7 stars and less?
Especially 1 or 2 stars? Persons who recommend garbage movies like The Mummy or Tomb Raider instead of this instant classic!
I consider them NOT to be cineasts and not to have any clue of filmmaking.Why is INDIANA JONES a classic character? Well, you see it in the first minutes of this one. It is simply one of the best and coolest introductions of a main character.
And hands down, Harrison Ford is so much better than all other ""Adventurers"", because he is charismatic, charming, cool and smart.RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK still is an cinematic experience. Not this rubbish modern CGI, shaky cam garbage, causing headache to normal thinking people.RAIDERS has a very good cast, with Karen Allen, Paul Freeman (especially him), Ronald Lacey, John Rhys Davies and Denholm Elliott.
One of John Williams' best scores! A soundtrack lke this one (or the Bond movies in the 60s, 70s and 80s, Rocky, Star Wars etc.), you won't find anymore.
These were the times were a soundtrack had tunes to remember and not just loud, dumb and monotone sounds.
Legendary composers like John Williams, Ennio Morricone, John Barry, Bernard Herrmann or Jerry Goldsmith.
The cinematography, by another legend Douglas Slocombe, is just fantastic. Real sets, real locations, suspense and humour...and not humour of the silly sort like half of the MCU or The Mummy, because Indiana Jones is a serious character with a lot of irony, but he knows his situations and doesn't dance in front of the baddies in a very serious and dangerous situation (just fpr some lame, silly laughs)."
hiddenwave93,"May 22, 2012",7/10,"This film, starring Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is a decent action film for its time. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is an archaeologist and a teacher at a college in the U.S. and besides teaching, he is on the hunt for the staff of Ra to get the lost ark. He isn't alone in trying to get the ark, however, because a group of Nazis are looking to obtain the ark to control God. The special effects are good for the time, however, to anyone watching this movie now would think they are cheesy and fake. The plot is very good and keeps you watching, but I feel that some of the escapes Indiana Jones makes isn't really realistic at all. All in all this movie is good, but you have to keep in mind that it was made many years ago."
dierregi,"Apr 10, 2017",5/10,"Since everybody knows what this movie is about, mine will be a review of the strongest and weakest points. At the time of release, this seemed a brand new approach to storytelling. I am not surprised it was a big success: Harrison Ford was smoldering hot and the supporting cast was great, with a special mention to John Rhys-Davies.With the passing of time and repeated views, I find the following weaknesses, common to many Spielberg (and action) movies:the overbearing soundtrack. I know many love it, I cannot stand it anymore. During the truck chase scene, there is nothing but the loud orchestra score booming ceaselessly, while Indy gets beaten but bounces back like a rubber manthe thin plot. The search for the Ark is just an excuse to create one action scene after the other. They increase in violence and implausibility, until the last one, possibly the silliest of the moviethe last ""action scene"". The ritual proposed by Belloq serves no purpose, apart from providing a bombastic ending to Indy's troubles. Anyway, it is unbelievable to imagine that Nazi troops would indulge the request of the French archaeologistthe ""super hero"" nature of Indy. Despite the premise that he is a ""normal"" guy, Indy is shown to suffer only slightly from inhuman beatingsall the sequels. None managed to reach even half-way the level of ""Raiders"" and considering this one already had its flaws.On the plus side:there are some moments of humour, unfortunately not enough. The best is the famous scene of Indy shooting the huge, menacing black-clad guy in the market. For one precious scene like this, we have the long and pointless fight with the German guarding the plane, back to conventional narrativean attractive hero with some intellectual pretense. Indy is supposed to be a beauty with a brain, contrary to way too many superheroes who are infesting the silver screen (even more so nowadays)the ironic endingConclusion: what seemed an innocuous narrative that looked back to the old serial movies of the past, turned into a monster that spawned endless sequels and imitators, creating the action-without-soul blockbusters plaguing more than ever contemporary cinema."

I am amazed that they made this in 81 when advanced vfx wasn't available. And still i felt nothing was lacked. Giving 9 stars just because of that.
fleetybanton,"Jan 19, 2025",10/10,"In the 80s there were a handful of action movies that were so well put together it makes you wonder if that decade was better than now or is nostalgia influencing my judgment. In this case I think I'm safe in saying this is a perfect filmIndiana Jones is such a rich character and to be able to go along with him on an epic adventure is truly a treat. The story is so magnetic, you have no other option but to be involved.And can we talk about Karen Allen?! Oh Karen, what a lovely actress! Her character, Marion is such a badass!This film made tons of kids become archeologists and that alone says something."

BenT17,"Sep 3, 2019",10/10,"I have been enthralled with the art of film since I was a little boy. There are plenty of movies that first got me hooked to the art form, but Raiders of the Lost Ark is the film that first conjured my fascination for cinema. For that, how could I not call this my favorite movie of all time? It has drastically changed my life.However, my endless love for this movie is not just due to nostalgia and personal importance (even though personal importance is obviously an important factor when considering your subjective favorite film). At the end of the day, it is truly no mystery why Raiders has sparked the love for cinema in the hearts of so many. It is a perfect film.Everything about Raiders is TIMELESS: William's iconic score, the exciting action, the all-time great characters, the performances, the clever dialogue, the enthralling romance, the creative writing, its originality, its innovation, its wit, Spielberg's masterful direction. I could write a full essay analyzing why each one of these things I've listed is phenomenal. Raiders is such a versatile, overachieving, and genre-bending film. It really has something for everyone. Heck, it even finds a way to throw some unforgettable moments of horror into the mix too.I'll take a moment to talk about the cast. Harrison Ford was born to play this role. Sure, he's great in Star Wars, Witness, Air Force One, The Fugitive, etc etc. However, it is Ford's performance in this film that elevates Indiana Jones from an already great character on paper to the greatest character in cinematic history. If not the greatest, than at least the most memorable and iconic.Other key performances include Karen Allen with one of action cinema's best love interests, Marion Craine, and Paul Freeman who plays the unforgettable antagonist of Rene Belloq. The latter I find to be a very understated performance, as Belloq is one of my all-time favorite antagonists.The masterminds behind the story and script of course deserve countless rounds of applause too. Lawrence Kasdan did an absolutely stunning job writing out the already genius story crafted by George Lucas and Phillip Kaufman.Most importantly, let's talk about Steven Spielberg's directing. It is arguably the best directed movie of all time. Every scene is gushing with Spielberg's distinct directorial style, innovation, and creativity. Most of all, it sticks out to me how organic Spielberg made such an out-there plot feel.In conclusion, I seriously can't find a single flaw within Raiders of the Lost Ark which is perhaps the only movie in which I can give that testament (When I say ""flaws"", I mean real flaws that negatively affect the experience of the movie. Just putting that out there before someone points out something like how the map in the background lists countries by their modern names instead of what their name was in 1937).In conclusion, Raiders of the Lost Ark will likely always be favorite movie. I've rewatched it hundreds of times, and yet, I have an absolute blast every single time I watch it. I expect to have a blast every time I watch it for the rest of my life.10/10."
MMacKK,"Dec 25, 2004",10/10,"The Indiana Jones series was the best series ever made, in my opinion. It was extremely fun and enjoyable to watch and it can be watched repeatedly, with no lesser joy. Harrison Ford as Indy is extremely charismatic, like Han Solo, but the character of Indiana for me has an essence that creates a more likable character (modesty, I think) and by doing that, it creates a better trilogy for me, indeed surpassing the Original Star Wars Tilogy (don't get me wrong I love Star Wars as well).Raiders is such a great film, containing some great action scenes (the Truck scene) and creating Indiana Jones, which is the best adventure hero ever made, partly I think due to Harrison Ford (I don't think these movies would have been as good with Tom Selleck)."
ArmandoManuelPereira,"Apr 10, 2020",6/10,"I first watched this movie in a theatre, when I was seventeen, and would have back then probably given it 10/10. Now, watching it again after so long, it has become only mildly enjoyable. To be sure Ford is fun to watch, and some scenes are too iconic to hate. But overall the enjoyment level has lessened, as has the quality of its thrills. Much like The Wizard of Oz has."
kristoffe-brodeur,"Nov 20, 2004",10/10,"There are only so many films in history that I can watch again and again, gaining new appreciation for, one of them is this film. I went from the movies to VHS, and finally to DVD. The availability and quality of this film keep raising the bar of what I can get from it.I read someone posted that this is the king of B movies or something of that sort, while I honestly think in some scenes like when Indy is running from the Hovitos and he rises over the hill, the film had a really strange documentary feeling, like if a comic actually came to life and like in the Twilight Zone, you were stuck in it. It is great to see this film, now that I edit and produce small independent films, and have worked in post production in Los Angeles. I honestly think almost every scene in this film is better than what's coming out today in sci-fi/adventure. I might pull back that comment in regards to some nice visuals in Riddick, and maybe the new Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith, but I'm not certain.The amount of time and effort put into the comedy, adventure, and depth of each character dazzles me because I really can't tell it was filmed the same year Fame was. It really has a unique look to it. The key lighting in the piece is amazing, almost everything looks like it was perfectly worked out.My only complaint is the attempt to visualize the opening of the Ark, as most of the other scenes don't deal with the supernatural except maybe a burning crate with a nazi symbol on it. George should redo that last scene in my opinion, and tighten it up, because I really think it wasn't coming together, however when I was a child it was so amazing and scary realistic. It's all perspective, but my point it that now in this modern filming era, the acting and film production is holding tight to this day.I forward you to just enjoy this film and look for things like formulas on chalkboards, skeletons in classrooms, proper patches on Nazi gear, gun accuracy. Research the film's era and background, and it only gets better. That's the ability that Spielberg and Lucas have, attention to detail and clever twists on most of their bodies of work.Watch this film again, it's worth it, I promise you."
lionel25,"Nov 23, 2004",6/10,"When I was a kid,I remember watching Indiana Jones again and again never getting bored... It has everything, great characters, story happens in many places around the world, it has the awful nazies... It was such a wonderful movies, but 25 years later i must admit that adventure movies have changed a lot and in a good way... The actors, the sets are less fake, in Idiana Jones the set looks like plastic, the actress is always screaming and drinking trying to show that she has some part in the story but doing nothing in particular... at least in our days girls have a real role, here in Indiana Jones she is less intelligent, less strong, she's immature... Awful ! No It was a good movie and sure it has a place in the story of cinema but I really doubt that new generation will watch it in the future as a godfather which will definitely still be watched in 50 years... note 6/10 for the nostalgie"
bithok,"May 4, 2005",4/10,"Most people give this movie a 10 out of 10 because they don't consider the movie but rather how happy they were to discover it as a child but now, in 2005, it has become obviously outdated, the script is quite bad and the acting is even worse. Harrisson Ford obviously should have worked his acting better, which he happily did since that movie. I am sorry I cannot just keep on lying about this movie: this is for your kids but in now way should it be put among masterpieces. IMDb is a web site about movies, not about cult and self-proclaimed nerds or geeks. You have to determine how good is a movie according to artistical criteria, neither to your gregarious instinct nor to your ""attitude""."
OrangeFoxyLady,"Feb 1, 2015",8/10,"A rip-roaring adventure with lots of hand-to-hand battles and plenty of guns means only one thing: entertainment for the whole family! There's not too much blood and gore, but it's still way up there in the body count department. Much of the thrill of this beloved movie is in the fright factor, so cadavers, snakes, spiders, and nasty villains (mostly Nazis and Nazi sympathizers) also abound. Throughout the film, there is a parade of anti-Nazi symbolism and sly religious satire. Harrison Ford is the embodiment of Indiana Jones -- dry, fearless, and as indestructible as a cartoon coyote. The female lead in an Indiana Jones movie is sort of an honorary boy, no more sexual than the girls in boys' adventure magazines, although Marian can more than take care of herself and is not helpless in the face of danger. The special effects, astonishing at the time, are still amazing, and Lucas' experience of ""Star Wars"" is visible. The movie is just plain fun."
LW-08854,"Dec 24, 2023",8/10,"A film that gave us a story packed full of action, amazing stunt work, a really imaginative production design, a fantastic score and lastly one of the greatest heroes in cinema, Indiana Jones, an archaeologist/adventurer. The film released in 1981 took inspiration from the swashbuckling 1940s/1950s era of Hollywood, in that respect the premise is simple, our hero must find the treasure, rescue the girl and save the world. The film was largely shot on location in North Africa and this adds a touch of grit and realism which really benefits the film, you see the little flies landing on the actors faces during a few close ups and see the sweat rolling off their brows. The film largely takes place in one location Egypt, with the very early part set in South and North America.The Blu Ray transfer looks really great, with lots of rich earthy colours, reds, browns, sandy yellows, greys & dark leathery brown, these tend to make up most of the costume design. The supporting cast are also very well written and good fun too, from the heroes to the villains. The tone of the film is adventurous and the pacing certainly gives the whole thing a massive injection of energy. There's a slight theme of magic v rationality, as the initially skeptical Indiana Jones is confronted with the dangerous reality of the power held within the lost ark he is seeking.There is not much in the way of character development, though the relationship between Dr Jones and the feisty and rather attractive Marion Ravenwood changes over the course of the film. The movies hail from the decade that was the 1980s and so we're given a slightly stronger female love interest than audiences were used to in the 1960s and 1970s, Marion's character shares similarities with Princess Leia in the Empire Strikes Back or Charlie Blackwood in Topgun, beautiful and alluring but also a tough-minded woman who takes no nonsense and will stand up for herself. You could certainly get away with more too in the 1980s cinema than you can today, the film features quite a lot of violence, blood and swearing for something that children were allowed to watch, I doubt a PG film today could get away with anything like this.The film's logic is not intended to be taken as 100% realistic, a main character in a realistic action film would probably die after the first 10 minutes. For this reason it's possible to overlook the numerous injuries Jones picks up which would put most people into hospital. The fact the German's had no presence in Egypt is also something you have to overlook in the film, the British in fact were in control of Egypt in 1936, it would have made more sense if the Fascists were working from Libya, but then Libya doesn't feel as Biblical as Egypt does, so I suppose the location was switched. You'd have to be pretty picky though to let things like this stop you from enjoying the film, the whole thing is about a search for a magic chest."
ylings-98434,"Jun 23, 2020",8/10,"Almost 40 years ago, I was not born. At that time, it should be a very exciting movie. Like alien movies, it's a little strange to watch now, but I believe it's because the same type of movies in the past 30 years are the result of their descendants. Some funny passages are humorous"
Mcduff3601,"Sep 19, 2023",10/10,"I first saw this at my Uncle's house during a party where they put on movies to entertain us kids. I was probably a bit too young to watch the last scene but I still loved it back then.I still love it today, I rewatch this one every couple of years, it is timeless as it is an 80's movie set in the 30s so it looks like it could have been made today outside some of the special effects.I think this is as close to perfect as an adventure movie can get. The acting is balanced between serious, corny and sweet. The pacing is perfect and the plot is fantastical. If you haven't seen this series PLEASE start with this one as the others don't hold a candle to it!!!"
li0904426,"Jan 13, 2022",10/10,I am a huge fan of Indiana Jones trilogy. It makes me stay away of my everyday chores for two exciting hours. It always mixes history facts with fiction plus lots of actions. Harrison Ford shines as Mr Jones.
flores91,"Jan 5, 2022",10/10,"OK this review is more an essay about what Raiders is NOT, rather than a review of what it is.It is NOT ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"". That was a clumsy attempt to force this movie into the later series' branding structure - something invented decades after Raiders was created. It is and always will be ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". Thankfully the tinkering has been limited to the title, and the film itself avoided the kind of disastrous meddling that Lucas inflicted on the original Star Wars trilogy.Raiders is not the sequels. Those are smudged by the fingerprints of studio execs and money counters. But Raiders feels like a passion project by two baby boomer film buffs with little interference (or interest) from a studio. And like an independent film, Raiders was not a huge hit initially in theaters, much to Paramount's dismay. But after the film found larger success with home viewing, naturally Paramount's corporate owners saw the opportunity to profit from sequels that could draw in the widest audience possible. For studio execs, that meant making subsequent entries ""kid friendly"" or, in reality, a dulling down of Indiana Jones.Raiders is not a ""kids' movie"". Lucas and Spielberg created Raiders as a love letter to the cinematic tough guy antiheroes that adults would remember. But the two couldn't help but be influenced by the gritty realism movement in 1970s cinema. Indy is tough and stoic, rough around the edges, but capable of making mistakes and getting hurt. He's charming and also a jerk. When in real danger, he shoots to kill. To their credit, Lucas and Spielberg didn't under estimate the intelligence or resilience of the audience, including kids.Raiders is not just an action movie. Unlike in countless movies that it inspired, the characters and story come first. In the 21st century, action or adventure movies are built around spectacle. Audiences experience movies as an assault on the senses. The level of spectacle and eye candy in Raiders feels refreshing, even quaint.Raiders is not magic. Indy's world is heightened and stylized, certainly. A supernatural presence appears for a reason and within the logical boundaries established in this world. When its purpose is fulfilled, the other-worldly tone retreats conclusively. Elements of the beyond are not pushed to the point of complete absurdity or insult the intelligence of the audience.Great flick. Ten out of ten stars."
bbewnylorac,"Dec 1, 2020",7/10,"If you don't nitpick too much, there's lots to like about this rollicking tale of the WWII era quest by an American archaeologist cum adventurer, Indiana Jones, to find a biblical treasure, the Ark of the Covenant, before the Nazis do. It's meant to be cartoonish in style, so just drink in the beautiful settings (Tunisia, Egypt, Nepal, South America), the excellent John Williams score, and the script and direction that, at times, can be witty and inventive. Harrison Ford was born to play the role of Indiana Jones, and he's actually intelligent - well done for casting him ahead of some dumb hunk who would not have been so believable as a brainy archaeologist. Ford is excellent at playing the guy who can get himself out of any hairy situation, although most of the time, e.g. in the Amazon rainforest, it's just not believable that he would not be slaughtered immediately by that indigenous army who know that forest back to front. In addition, the indigenous men are improbably inaccurate archers in running after Ford. Karen Allen, as Ford's old girlfriend Marion, is one of the best things about the movie. The producers are ground-breaking, or maybe it's the first time since those feisty heroines of the 1940s, in depicting a lead woman as clothed, intelligent, physically strong and actually saving Indiana many times. She's fantastic. The scene of her out-drinking a local woman in Nepal is priceless. She deserved her own movie. The bad guys are the most cliched characters in this movie. They may as well have a sign on their head - ""I'm evil."" But as I said, it's meant to be a rollicking adventure, and not a serious drama that you'd criticise too heavily as not being realistic."

VitalyBe,"Apr 26, 2004",3/10,"I can't understand how this movie got rated so high. It is just yet another stupid action movie and I found really NOTHING remarkable about it.I don't think someone else could get a movie with more kitsch even if one tried, I guess that's what they mean when they say that the movie is one of a kind. It is full of silly one-liners, same idiotic comedy ""combat"" and the (how could we do without) sexy heroine that's there only to give some sex moments.There was no plot I could spot, I mean, unless you count the ""nazis digging artifact. Indiana Jones must get artifact from them"" as plot"". Could it get more stupid??I could go talking for several pages what I disliked about this movie but I'd be just wasting my time I guess.

Bernie4444,"Dec 10, 2023",10/10,"This is the first in a series of fun to watch action-packed movies based on what an archeologist should be. Being a first you will not notice the pattern of the film unless you are used to Saturday matinees.We hit the ground running on this one as we see Indiana Jones making a John Wayne type of entrance. So much that you do not notice the dubious-looking character next to him Statipo (Alfred Molina). Until he says, ""Give me the Idle and I will give you the whip.""Now settled down, after his near-miss with the natives, Harrison Ford is a professor (Indiana Jones) teaching the fact that archeology is a search for facts, not some thrill ride.That very afternoon he is confronted by some government agents. It seems that his old professor Abner Ravenwood has disappeared. They picked up some radio transmissions that contained the name of Abner and a city Tannis. Immediately Indiana Jones knows that the Nazis (natural bad guys) are looking for the Ark of the Covenant (which can be used as a weapon of unspeakable power) and somehow, he must beat them to it for the sake of the world.He is helped by an old love interest Marion (Karen Allen) and rivaled by an old nemesis Dr. Rene Belloq (Paul Freeman).Does the Ark exist?How can he beat them to it?Why is he on the outs with Abner?Hold on for a thrill a minute and do not eat any bad dates."
deloudelouvain,"Dec 19, 2023",8/10,"After 42 years there is a new Indiana Jones and that was for me a good excuse to rewatch all the others. So I started with Raiders Of The Lost Ark, a movie that has a special meaning for me as it was the first movie I ever watched at the cinema, when it was still something special to watch a movie on a big screen. My godfather took me to the cinema and as a young kid I was incredibly wowed by this movie from Steven Spielberg. I still consider it as the perfect example for how a movie should be in the Adventure genre. It aged very well, I still enjoyed it like the first time. Harrison Ford is perfect in the role of Indie, makes me curious to see how he does in the latest one, as I can't see him jumping and running around anymore like he used to do. Karen Allen is eye candy. She has that innocent sexy look and is a pleasure to watch. Raiders Of The Lost Ark is already so old but still one of the better ones from the Indiana Jones franchise, and a reference for the adventurous movies."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Aug 28, 2023",10/10,"Being a kid back in the day when the 1981 movie ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was originally released and growing up watching the Indiana Jones movies, I have to say that this movie from director Steven Spielberg is a classic. It is a movie that has as much appeal today as it did back when it was just released.The storyline in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one that embodies adventure and a hero character that you just can't help but like, admire and want to be. Such is the phenomena that is Indiana Jones, a true pop culture phenomena in every aspect. And that is what makes these movies so very enjoyable. Writers Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman put together a script and storyline that not only is amazingly entertaining and enjoyable, but also highly memorable. It is an adventure with a wide appeal to every age group and member in the audience, both young and old alike.The acting in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is good, and they definitely had a great cast ensemble for the movie. Of course Harrison Ford has managed to become an epitome of Indiana Jones and no one can fill the shoes that he has left for this character and the franchise. Harrison Ford simply is Indiana Jones. But also with the likes of Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, John Rhys-Davies, Ronald Lacey, Denholm Elliott, Alfred Molina and Wolf Kahler on the cast list, then you are in very capable hands throughout the course of the 115 minutes that the movie runs for.""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" has a great character gallery, with very memorable characters, both good and evil. And that is a great testimony to the writing skills of Lawrence Kasdan, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.There is a good amount of action and thrills throughout the course of the 115 minute that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" runs for, and the audience is taken along on a rather enjoyable and entertaining thrill ride with director Steven Spielberg at the helm.Visually then the effects in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" are good. Sure, some of them do come off as a bit antequated when you watch the movie today, but generally it has withstood the passing of time quite admirably.If you enjoy adeventure movies, and not already familiar with ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", then it is definitely a movie you have to track down and watch.My rating of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" lands on a ten out of ten stars."

And a lot of the movies today that I have watched and which I really liked have similar aspects and qualities to that have Indiana Jones.Overall a enjoyable movie even with it's somewhat lacking effects, it had a great cast and will be memorable from audiences from all ages young and old. It's a must watch if you prefer classics over modern movies. Rewatchable: Unlikely..."
maxi888,"Feb 27, 2010",6/10,One of the strong points of this film is the detail in the settings and the nature of adventure. However the film falls short in execution.The film opens brilliantly in an enclosed jungle setting and is highly immersive and then paints a picture of Indy's background. Then we move to the colourful Nepal setting and lastly the Egypt setting. At this point of the film I thought it would become an epic picture. However I was quite wrong.The major fallacies of the film are the religious overtones that are ever-present in the film. It becomes suffocating. I know that Hitler actually did send expeditions during the war to uncover certain places/artifacts that would increase the power of the Nazi regime. What doesn't make sense is why Hitler would search for the Ark of the Covenant which is solely Jewish and Hitler despising Jews. It seemed quite illogical.Secondly the score is over the top and actually draws you away from the film. Constantly you will hear the Indiana Jones theme song being pulsated into your ear. It comes to a point where it is incredibly overbearing.Thirdly the action scenes are dull and prolonged. To put it simply the actions scenes are like watching two snails brawling. Being an adventure film of epic proportions this film should have had interesting action scenes however yet again it falls short.The immersion that was seen in the beginning of the film with Indiana searching for the golden artifact completely disappears in the later sections of the film. When Indiana is searching for the Ark the same level of detail and immersion is completely missing and ruins the scene.Overall the movie is enjoyable but the fallacies ultimately cheapen the viewer's experience.

aristofanis,"May 30, 2008",6/10,"A brave American archaeologist defies, almost singlehandedly, Nazis, Arabs and a sleazy Canadian in an ongoing pursuit filled with gunshots, explosions and fist fighting in order to bring to the safe hands of the US academia a significant relic of the Hebrews. Apart from the political undertones, there are way too many predictable things happening in this movie as the 'good' guys win over the 'bad'. Seeing this movie at the age of 7 must be exhilarating. Seeing it at the age of 14 must be quite fun. But if you are any older than that, most scenes will seem redundant. I believe that most viewers' ecstasy with this movie stems from their nostalgia to when they first saw it and that's legitimate."
grybop,"Oct 24, 2008",3/10,"I've been avoiding Indiana Jones like the plague until tonight when I decided to see what it's all about. And boy was I in for a treat! I was laughing so hard at every action scene! The music was so laughable, Harrison Ford played worse than Paris Hilton sings and every cliché imaginable was there.The plot is virtually non-existent during the first half of the movie and when the real action finally kicks in, you see Dr. Jones escaping from difficult situations with unbelievable ease, the ridiculous music score serving as another way of applauding his actions. Those were the best bits. Because then you have the totally random ending that turns your laughter into a WTF expression.The characters are paper-thin - not to mention Spielberg's obsession with the Germans (or anyone non-American or non-Jewish) who have to be depicted as either superevil or superstupid.Unintentionally funny, totally predictable and a waste of money and film. How anyone with an average IQ can enjoy this is beyond me."
martinpersson97,"Jul 7, 2023",10/10,"(I will note that I have rated this trilogy as a whole - this movie is rather a 9, though a 10 would perhaps be fair)Raiders of the Lost Ark, Steven Spielberg's iconic adventure that harkens back to the classic matinees and adventures and one of the few films in the genre nominated for Best Picture at the Oscars.It is of course entirely deserving of all the praise it has gotten - like his starring role in the Star Wars trilogy before it, Harrison Fors gives the performance of a life time and the overall tone is somewhat reminiscent of Star Wars. It's just lighthearted and fun, good vs. Evil and a colourful cast of memorable characters.The cinematography, cutting and editing is incredible, and it showcases some iconic and incredible action set pieces.Overall, an incredible and fun adventure that goes without saying, is definitely recommended!"
mariamasha-48835,"Jan 19, 2022",8/10,"The spirit of adventure pervades this film from start to finish. Historically, adventure is almost always intertwined with travel as well as exploration. Therefore, Mr. Jones is an archaeologist. And in order to immediately dot the ""i"", it should be noted that the ""Hunters"" are very far from the reliability. Archaeologists will surely notice many simulated nuances when events take place in ancient buildings, and historians will definitely see objects in the frame that did not actually exist in 1936. But this is a movie about adventure, not historical events.In my opinion, to some extent, this film can literally be called the perfect adventure film. It has all the necessary components: a fascinating story, a bewitching atmosphere, a disturbing horror-mystery with fantasy elements, romance, action and a perfect ending in which the good win and the evil brutally get what they deserve. Therefore, who has not seen, do not waste time and enjoy watching."
lucasedu-28094,"Sep 25, 2020",9/10,"I never set out to watch Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark, because I just didn't ... like it so much. Yes, you feel like hitting me for it, but it's the truth. When I got older, I decided to give the film a chance, and it surprised me: what I thought was just an adventure film proved something else. A film in which you care for the characters, and see that it is better that the Ark is never found. The action scenes are very good and the CGI, although it may seem weak (after all, it was 1981), fulfills its role well (snakes still agonize me today). The actors are also very good, especially Harrison Ford, who was and is the right actor to live our beloved hero (also highlighted by Karen Allen).
In short, stop what you're doing and go watch The Raiders of the Lost Ark (before they find it).PS: Sorry for the mistakes (if you have), because I'm Brazilian and I'm using Google Translate (forgive me)"
andrewmerritt-31652,"Jul 12, 2019",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark stars Harrison Ford and is directed by Steven Spielberg. Raiders of the Lost Ark follows Indiana Jones as he races against the Nazis to obtain the Lost ark of the covenant. Fresh off of completing Star Wars George Lucas and Steven Spielberg came up with this idea as they were on vacation. And instead of forgetting about it the next day or creating a ""movie of the week"" that nobody would care about, they actually decided to let their imaginations run wild. Now I'm sure that before they created Raiders of the Lost Ark they saw a lot of movies involving treasure hunting and decided to give it a makeover. And from their they decided to turn something that sounds like it came out of a B movie and transformed it into an A++ movie after the project was finished. But Raiders of the Lost Ark is The Godfather of treasure hunting movies and all the treasure hunting movies are good, but they don't have that passion and majestic as Raiders of the Lost Ark offers. I should also add that it's also the inspiration for many movies and video games over the years and has been referenced in many pop cultures. You can not turn on the T.V. And having someone reference Indiana Jones or the scenes that gave birth to countless of directors and writers imitating those scenes. This movie and Star Wars were the first movies to open my eyes to many movies to come. And there are many movies out there that brilliantly fantastic, but Raiders of the Lost Ark and Star Wars were the first to do that. Besides Steven Spielberg, George Lucas, and John Williams, I don't know if the other crew who were in Star Wars also were involved in making this. I would like to think so as they borrow elements from Star Wars such as music, special effects, costumes, to just about anything you can think of and then it into something simple and easy without anything being over dramatic. I also applaud Steven Spielberg and George Lucas for having the ability to create one movie that blew people's minds and creating another movie with an iconic character for many years that people wish they could be. Because in the end who doesn't want to be Indiana Jones? So in the end every thing about this move is pure cinematic perfection that is worth exploring again and again."
TheCorniestLemur,"Feb 25, 2022",10/10,"Holy friggin' toss buckets, I haven't seen this since I was...12 maybe, and yet it's still every bit as good as I remember. Like, I was starting to wonder if maybe I was wrong when I said that Spielberg does in fact, deserve his status as one of the greats after I only thought that Jaws was good and not great, but oh my god yes, yes, yes he does.I think this might actually be one of those rare flawless films, and you know I don't say that lightly if you've read my reviews for my 10/10 films, so let me lay it all out...Harrison Ford certainly does not have many roles that many people would claim are better, or even equal to, Han Solo, but goddamn I think Indy might just be better. And he's so funny, so likable, so badass, yet feels so...human. He never feels indestructible, or like he doesn't ever cock up, and more action films need to bloody remember that. And holy god does 1981 Harrison Ford have this bisexual positively reeling...no I refuse to not mention that.Karen Allen as well...why the hell does she not have more of a career? Why is she hardly in anything else that anyone would know her from? She's feisty, she takes no crud from anyone, and yes, maybe she also has me reeling. Leave me alone.Paul Freeman played one of the best and most sickeningly charming villains of all time in Belloq, and even having just rewatched Lord Of The Rings recently, yes, Sallah is a better role from John Rhys-Davies than Gimli. Basically what I'm saying is that every single one of the characters is perfect, their dialogue is perfect, and every single one of the actors playing them is perfect also.The story is kind of simple, yes, but does it need to do anything more than what it does? Hell no, this might be one of the best scripts ever written for how much it is consistently squeezing every last drop of adventure, tension, and excitement out of the narrative, and this is Spielberg at the absolute top of his game. It might well have one of the best scripts ever written, but if Spielberg wasn't in the director's chair on this (or if Douglas Slocombe wasn't DP), then it might not even be remembered nowadays.And while it is a tight, tight, TIGHT competition for the crown, this might just have John Williams' best work in it too. The score is breathtaking, and really, just the sound in general of this film is amazing. No film has ever had a gunshot or punching sound effect quite like this one.And really, if I'm even taking time to praise the gunshot and punching sound effects, that should just tell you everything you need to know about how perfect I consider this film to be.Why the hell haven't I watched this since my early teens, I'm a damn idiot."
Bored_Dragon,"Dec 26, 2020",8/10,"I believe that there is no need to give a summary of the most legendary adventure film ever made. When you think of Harrison Ford, you think of Indiana Jones. And don't lie you think of ""Star Wars"". It may be a bigger and more popular franchise, but I bet Indiana is everyone's first association. A charismatic professor of archaeology who swings his whip in remote places of the third world, overcomes all obstacles with ease of a comic-book hero, a charmer who seduces women and audiences and who has marked childhood for many generations. Technically excellent, visually impressive (except for the quite silly special effects towards the end), atmospheric, with perfectly balanced elements of adventure, action, humor, and romance. It may not be a masterpiece of cinematography, but with its spirit and influence on the genre as well as on generations of viewers, it certainly deserves cult status.8/10"
jackdremel,"Jan 23, 2020",6/10,"I guess you can say I am a hater of this movie, even though I don't think it's that bad. It's just not that good either. Don't get me wrong, the music and Indiana character are both iconic. Everyone knows the theme and recognizes the hero with the hat and whip. I think that's why this movie gets so much hype. It's so iconic and nostalgic that people overlook everything else.The story is pretty mindless. It's a race to see who can find the ark first. Indy always gets outsmarted by the other guys but manages to escape again and again. There's no real dialog that has any depth to it and as great as the soundtrack is, it is also distracting. The ending is kind of lackluster. I mean, the face melting is cool, but afterwards it just ends with no real resolution.In my opinion, it's just an ok action/adventure movie that happens to have a really charismatic and iconic hero. I'm not even a fan and I was Indiana Jones for Halloween one year. But if you want a great adventure movie, there are others that beat this by a mile. In my opinion, the Goonies is a 10x better adventure movie. The characters have emotions and a reason to fight, the bad guys are funny but not in a cheesy way, the soundtrack is incredible but not intruding, and the ending has a true resolution that leaves you smiling. To me, that's a 10/10, which is why this is a 6/10."
AW_McGOWAN,"Dec 13, 2020",8/10,"Staring Harrison Ford, directed by Steven Spielberg, and produced by George Lucas, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" brought together three legends of 1980s Hollywood for a truly magical piece of cinema. An adventure film in the purest form, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is like ""Star Wars"" in the sense that it took an outmoded, B-movie genre and brought it back with unprecedented scale and dignity.Harrison Ford plays Indiana Jones, an archeologist in 1936 tasked with finding the Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis do. The Ark - a hollowed chest from the Bible, claimed to hold the original Stone Tablets of the Ten Commandments - carries an awesome power that, if fallen into the wrong hands, could be catastrophic.Jones' quest sends him on a worldly journey. The film begins in a Peruvian jungle, then after brief stint in the United States, travels to Nepal, Egypt, and the ocean before climaxing on a small island in the Aegean Sea. Not all scenes were filmed on-location, but the settings are convincing enough. Practical effects and miniatures also make ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" a relic of the 1980s American blockbuster.It is also an accessible film for people of all ages and interests. Not a science fiction or fantasy piece, it does not cater to an esoteric fan base. History buffs will enjoy the film for its archeological themes, but it is not made for academics alone. Regular moviegoers seeking action-packed thrills will find it just as satisfying.Furthermore, the story is smart, but simple enough for kids to enjoy just as much as adults. The good guys and the bad guys are clear, as are the simple messages of justice and heroism. This is thanks to Harrison Ford's spot-on embodiment of Jones, as well as that special Spielberg touch. The director evokes something of a John Ford Western in this movie, but cuts out anything archaic while adding in a dash of James Bond excitement. There are chases and shootouts, along with romance and humor, and an iconic John Williams score to tie it all together. Not a single frame passes as dull.The movie is not just easy to enjoy, but it is hard to imagine anyone not enjoying it. Many movies have tried to capture the spirit of Indiana Jones over the years, but barring the sequels to ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark,"" few have hit the mark. It's sense of adventure feels familiar and easy to emulate, but somehow, it remains one-of-a-kind."
strong-122-478885,"Oct 30, 2016",7/10,"*Favourite ""Indiana Jones"" quote* - ""I hate snakes!""For having just a PG-13 rating - I was completely taken by surprise by all of the violence, gore and bloodshed that prevailed in this top-notch Action/Adventure film from 1981.Featuring a first-rate, adrenaline-rush, opening sequence - ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" certainly delivered plenty of awesome, over-the-top stunts, as well as some good touches of cynical humour (thrown in for good measure) that kept all of the action moving along at near break-neck speed, throughout.My 2 favourite characters in this fast-paced action picture were - (1) Dr. Rene Belloq, the utterly ruthless villain, and Nazi-collaborator, played so wickedly nasty by actor Paul Freeman - And, of course - (2) Indiana Jones, our archaeologist-hero (sans super-powers), played very tongue-in-cheek by Harrison Ford.My biggest complaint here has to do with the unwelcome introduction of the Marion Ravenwood character into the story. To me, her presence in the action only served to interfere and undermine Indiana Jones's heroic quest to uncover the legendary ""Ark of the Covenant"" before the evil Nazis did."
christophe92300,"Apr 27, 2013",4/10,"Raiders Of The Lost Ark is widely regarded as the quintessence of the adventure-action movie. However, there is so much to say about it is hard to understand how it can be such highly considered.Everything isn't bad. There are, in particular, very good actions scenes such as the opening scene or the one in the temple with the snakes, and some well thought-out touches of humour. But we are under the impression that the plot is secondary, in fact you forget about it after some time, and that it is just a pretext for blowing us away with those action scenes, like blockbusters do nowadays.The flaws are obvious, from the shallow characters to the choppy rhythm or the mediocre editing with a lot of jump cuts or continuity errors. A few extremely far-fetched scenes also discredit the movie.Raiders Of The Lost Ark is therefore far from perfect and certainly cannot pretend to the rank of masterpiece some give it."
sixstud-9-376449,"Jul 5, 2018",10/10,"What can I possibly add to what has already been written? This film is a ""masterpiece"". It's placed in quotations because that word is bandied about on here for films that aren't fit to lace this movies' boots. This movie should be preserved for all eternity as a template on how to make an incredibly entertaining and wonderful film, and as I said earlier, there isn't much I can add to what has already been said about Raiders. Let's just say that there are only so many films I plan on introducing to my children when they get old enough and this film is amongst that list.
Harrison Ford was amazing in the titular role, and the supporting cast added immense scale and brevity to the work HF was doing as Indy.
Spielberg and Lucas created a character and movie for the ages.Keep an eye out for one of the most iconic film sequences of all time as well!Make sure that you give this film the rating and love it deserves. Thank you for reading!"
lebowskirulz,"Aug 9, 2018",10/10,"This film had a huge impact on my life. It (as well as Aliens) really introduced me to the films I love. The 80s and 90s were amazing for film while I was growing up. I love all the practical effects and wish they were still used a lot more than they are but cgi has taken over. Oh well. At least it has improved drastically over the years. Anyway, I feel like everyone should see this in their life and if you haven't....get on it"

It's a movie I can watch countless times and never get bored of it (I have seen it several hundred times but can't count how many exactly). Simply, it's the quintessential action movie! One with a amazing story, super-cool hero, great bad guys, and awesome settings. There's not much else to be said...just watch it!"

Tolispro,"Mar 30, 2019",10/10,"One of the most iconic heroes in movie history. You got George Lucas fresh out of episode 5, you got Steven Spielberg with movies such as Jaws to his name and you got Harrison Ford who by the time Raiders had come out he was already a household name. I think that--is a formula to success."
Ricky_Roma__,"Jun 2, 2008",N/A,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is an action masterpiece. There's not one bit of fat on its bones. There's not one wasted moment. It flows exactly like an adventure movie should  it continually moves forward, breathlessly driving you towards the conclusion; it's incredible fun.The reason why the film works so well is because the script is so tight. The exposition is clear and well delivered, meaning that you know precisely what's at stake, small character details are set up early on and paid off later and the dialogue is incredibly pithy. It's a masterclass in film writing.However, this would mean nothing if all the other elements didn't come together. Thankfully they do. Spielberg's direction is superb, Harrison Ford is perfect as the hero, Karen Allen is wonderful as the heroine and the music is out of this world. Plus the action is kick ass.My favourite action scene is the fight with Pat Roach by the plane. Quite unusually for a film hero, Indy doesn't mind fighting dirty. He kicks Roach in the balls, he throws sand in his face and he even bites him. Indy doesn't have to win a fight fairly. And it's also unusual for a film hero to be so vulnerable. We rarely see anyone get a scratch or put in any real jeopardy. But here Indy gets his arse handed to him. The only reason he survives is because he's so wily  after getting beaten and bruised for a while he leads Roach into getting chopped up by the plane's rotor blades.My second favourite action sequence is when Indy chases after the Ark and recovers it by hijacking a Nazi truck. After the CGI mess of Kingdom of the Crystal Skull, it's great to see old-fashioned stunts. It's a much better way of letting you get absorbed by the action  even though you know it's a film, you know someone actually had to do this, making everything much more impressive to watch. The best stunt is when Indy is thrown through the front window and has to pull himself along the bottom of the truck. He manages to do this and then hooks his whip under the bottom so that he's dragged along the ground. He then manages to get back on the truck and back in the cabin. It's a joy to behold and allows you to immerse yourself in the action.Another great thing about the sequence is that once again we're shown Indy's vulnerability. As he's driving he gets shot in the arm. And then later a guy punches him in his injured arm and throws him out of the truck. Therefore when Indy comes back and beats the crap out of this guy, it's doubly satisfying, because not only is the guy a damn Nazi, but he also had the audacity to try and injure our hero. And the blood and guts reminds me of how gritty the film is. Not only do we have Indy getting shot in the arm and then having the wound beaten, but earlier on a guy gets shot in the face  lots of blood pours down from the hole in his skull. Oh, and he's also on fire. Excellent.But as well as this there's also stuff that is just plain over the top. The melting faces for instance and Belloq's head exploding. This scared the hell out of me as a kid and I'm still amazed that stuff like this was included in a 'kids' film.However, the scene that terrified me the most as a kid was the scene where Marion gets mugged by skeletons and we then see a large snake oozing from a skull's mouth. I was so traumatised I refused to watch the film for years. But now the vague horror element is another reason I adore the movie. It sets it apart from almost every action/adventure film that came before it and nothing else has managed to better it, even subsequent Indiana Jones films.But watching the film now it's quite unusual to note that Indy doesn't kill any of the three main villains. They're all killed by the Ark. Indy instead just closes his eyes and lets 'god' do the rest. It's a strange ending but one that works perfectly. Indy isn't a killing machine. He's someone trying to do the right thing. And at the end he's rewarded by, well, not having his face melted off.Another reason why Raiders stands out is because of its heroine. She's one of the best in modern cinema  a tough woman who constantly shows her toughness without having to resort to ridiculous feats of physicality. We don't see her pummel men who are twice her size, but we do see her out smart them and drink them under the table. As well as this she has great chemistry with Indy. For instance, there's the marvellous scene where she tries to look after our injured hero and he cries like a girl every time she touches him. He then points out a few places where it doesn't hurt, which she kisses. It's a lovely scene. And I also like the bit of slapstick humour earlier where Indy gets a mirror smashed in his face when Marion turns it over.This leads me to another reason why Raiders is brilliant. It's very funny. You have a monkey giving a Nazi salute, Indy nonchalantly shooting a swordsman, Sallah's cowardly reactions at the Well of Souls and the Gestapo man plunging his hand in the snow after he gets it burnt while trying to grab an extremely hot bronze medallion. The humour is great.And on top of all of this cinematic goodness  the humour, the action, the adventure  you have one of the best opening sequences in film. It's a bravura piece of film-making  everything clicks perfectly."
jpw-55513,"Aug 14, 2019",10/10,"At the time this movie was first released, I saw a lot of movies. I pretty much saw every new release as it came out.So, I went to see Caveman (was I the only one who saw Caveman?) and it was billed with a Sneak Preview. The Sneak Preview was unnamed. If you can believe it, I sat through Caveman and made it to the Sneak Preview. I am glad I did. Raiders of the Lost Ark was the Sneak Preview and I was able to view the film before anyone even knew about it. It is a great movie with tons or drama, action, special effects and even Nazis. This movie has everything. It is a real treat."
Levana,"Feb 5, 1999",2/10,"It's good to know I'm not the only person in America who thinks ""The Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is stupid and offensive.  With its villains designed only as punching bags (they are human, none the less...), its heroine intended to be ogled and scream at the right moments, and its pseudo-religious claptrap, all the praise it's gotten says something very disturbing about large numbers of people."
bh_tafe3,"Aug 17, 2014",10/10,"There are no set qualities for a great film. Some movies like Citizen Kane are towering Cathedrals, crowned with outstanding lead performances, their every shot awash with gravitas and innovation, two hour pieces of high art with relatively simple stories. Other films are great stories, superbly told, like The Shawshank Redemption, Braveheart and Slumdog Milllionaire. And then there are films like this one which are a joyous, fun celebration of all the things we love about movies and film making.Every scene of this is fun and enjoyable. A rollicking chase between two rival archaeologists as they travel all over the world (the film using world maps so we can keep track of the action) in search of the mystical ""ark of the covenant."" Throw in some Nazis, snake phobia, cutting edge (for the time) special effects, a damsel in distress and the Saturday matinée feel and you have an adventure film like no other to that point in time.For star Harrison Ford, this film, on the back of his turn as Han Solo in an expanded role in 1980's The Empire Strikes Back confirmed his status as the pre eminent leading man of his time, and from the start, this is his movie. We follow his adventures for an inordinate number of minutes before the director shows us his face, we see him fearlessly tackle big hairy spiders, leaps of doom, deadly arrows and rolling stone balls before the film is 15 minutes old. We also see him lose his first big battle on screen with his rival Belloq. And in those first 15 minutes we learn everything we need to about his character and the film. Indy is fearless, principled, a bit of a screw up and not a particularly good archaeologist. No wonder he has to work as a teacher to pay the bills. From that point on he becomes all things to all people. The film rarely lets up on the action, with chase after chase, and usually ending in Indy being outwitted by his smarter, better resourced rival.Ford is absolutely superb. While I personally believe that the film still would have been a success had Spielberg's original choice for the role, Tom Selleck, been available, it is now impossible to see anyone else in the role. Spielberg has also surrounded Ford with a great supporting cast including Denholm Elliott, John Rhys Davies, Paul Freeman, Karen Allen and Ronald Lacey, as well as a very young Alfred Molina. Allen in particular is great as the love interest/ damsel in distress.The effects, for the time were breathtaking, bringing the settings alive and nearly making us believe that the Nazis faces are melting at the film's end. Some of the blue screen shots leave a little to be desired, but it was still fairly early in the evolution of that film making technology, and so these are forgivable. The set pieces are expertly realized and the fight scenes well choreographed.In the end Raiders is the finest example of the adventure genre, made the more entertaining for the fact that our protagonist is not a particularly successful adventurer. It has enough silly to be fun, without being stupid and remains, more than 30 years on, as one of the most entertaining films not just of its era, but in all of American cinema."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Mar 17, 2020",8/10,"Everyone has that movie that traumatized them as a child but didn't really affect anyone else. For me, that was Raiders of the Lost Ark (and Who Framed Roger Rabbit, but that's another story). It's the snakes really that did it, and godamn that snake scene near the end is still difficult for me to watch. Beyond that though, it's a shame it took me so long to give this film another look, because it's really a perfect adventure film. Not an action film (though there is action in it) but an adventure film. That's a genre we don't really see a lot anymore, and it's a real shame. There is such a spirit of fun and adventure to this whole movie that, besides the snakes, it's a real joy to watch"
daoldiges,"Nov 14, 2022",8/10,"When I first saw Raiders of the Lost Ark back in 1981 I was quite taken by it. I reveled in the excitement of the adventure it took me on. Having seen it again recently was a slightly different experience. In part because I've grown and changed, and perhaps also because I've since seen so many other films copy elements of this film that it didn't possess that same sense of originality of adventure. Harrison Ford and solid and likeable here. Raiders of the Lost Ark is still fun and still provides a sense of adventure. I also think it is the best of the series as well and worth checking out, in particular on the big screen if possible."
gettodamoofies,"Jun 20, 2023",10/10,"FILM: 10/10.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a timeless classic and, without a doubt, my favorite Indiana Jones movie. From start to finish, it is a flawless masterpiece that captivates audiences with its gripping story and impeccable casting.This film is the perfect blend of action, adventure, history, and the supernatural. George Lucas's story is a true gem, while John Williams' iconic score adds another layer of magic to the entire experience. The film has a heightened afternoon-matinee feel, with its ridiculously over-the-top sound effects that make guns sound like cannons and punches like body slams.Steven Spielberg's direction is masterful, and his control over every aspect of the film is evident. Right from the opening scene, he effortlessly establishes the characters and tone, immediately immersing the viewers in this thrilling world. Harrison Ford shines as the iconic Indiana Jones, and it's his portrayal that truly makes the film work. Indy is a complex character who exhibits courage, fear, toughness, tenderness, brutality, and humor, all of which Ford captures flawlessly.The fight and action scenes in Raiders of the Lost Ark are nothing short of spectacular. Each one is smartly staged and offers something different, keeping the audience on the edge of their seats. It's hard not to get caught up in the excitement and adventure as Indy races against time to uncover the mysteries and protect ancient artifacts.The chemistry between Harrison Ford and Karen Allen is palpable, with Allen serving as the perfect foil for Ford's Indy. Additionally, John Rhys-Davies delivers an immensely enjoyable performance that adds depth and humor to the film.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic in every sense of the word. It has stood the test of time and continues to enchant audiences with its thrilling storyline, well-crafted characters, and unforgettable moments.

guskeller,"Feb 20, 2022",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the greatest adventure films ever. It combines prime entertainment with purposeful substance. Clearly, Indiana Jones is a movie character icon, but the plot is equally significant to the film's success. The search for the Ark has mystery, excitement, romance, action, and thematic weight. Furthermore, Jones evolves from a practical cynic into a believer in powers beyond his understanding. The bittersweet ending underscores this by denying Jones' desires but providing an emotional need instead. Plus, Ford is the perfect embodiment of Jones' larger than life persona. Ford is Indiana Jones, and Jones is Harrison Ford.Meanwhile, Raiders is driven by its filmmaking. The cinematography uses dramatic composition, lighting, and movement to intensify adventure and meaning. The editing is energetic during action and efficient during exposition. The exaggerated sound heightens combat and supernatural elements. The legendary music and production design are critical to Indiana's iconic pop culture status. Also, the effects are complex and tangible, making the film a genuine thrill ride. Lastly, the direction unites these ingredients into an irresistible journey that's truly lightning in a bottle. Ultimately, the universal love for Raiders of the Lost Ark is undeniably justified.Writing: 9/10

interestingstuff,"Jun 3, 2023",6/10,"Most people giving this movie 9s and 10s are simply nostalgic because they saw the movie as a kid, fell in love with it many years ago and they remember it very fondly and giving it super generous (but unrealistic) ratings. I too watched this as a kid and loved it back then but after watching this as an adult, I am not impressed anymore.The movie tries to become too many things at once. It tries to become an action movie, horror movie, comedy movie, mystery movie, historical movie, war movie, love movie and superhero movie, spy movie all at once and has no direction. Its storytelling is too clumsy and jumps from place to place without proper transition and it's tiring to even try to follow the story let alone enjoying it. The movie tries to become too many things at once and doesn't become anything in the end.Also Indiana Jones literally beats up the entire German army with his bare fists. Yep, he beats up every German soldier one by one without even using any weapons. I guess the entire WW2 was just a fist fight between two armies and no guns were involved at all. Maybe guns weren't even invited back then.Also how is it that Dr. Jones gets captured like 10 times and his enemies let him go every time? What kind of bad guys are these?This is an ok movie to pass the time but NO WAY it's a 8.4 movie. The movie's rating is inflated by at last 2.5 points by nostalgic folks who remember it as a great movie when they first saw it 25-30 years ago when they were kids."
decamps,"Sep 15, 2004",3/10,"The ""raiders of the ark"" is probably a genre by itself.It is not an action film. You should not expect more than a couple of gunfires and some whisp tricks. Is it realistic? Not at all, except if you consider that a man can move a pyramid's hone to escape from the pyramid.It is not humoristic, either (is there a single play on words?). Actually, it is rather completely stupid. A typical scene is the guy who sees a skeleton and howls like a fool for five seconds.The scenario is very boring. There is not a single second of suspense.Ironically, what makes the film watchable is the soundtrack. No, actually, it is not sufficient, I stopped watching near the end.Really, I don't understand how many people can consider this crap deserves to be watched. How can it be in the top 250 ?"
MRavenwood,"Nov 11, 2005",10/10,"There are so many ways in which this film is perfect, most notably is the brilliant re-packaging of old-school action and war films; away from the James-Bond style of the late 60s; away from the Cold-War suspense and intrigue. One of the most endearing features of the picture is that the movie opens with the main character,Indiana Jones' at the close of his current adventure. The technique generates an immediate sense of personal history and intimacy with the main character, and in effect, serves the audience dessert twice.The atmosphere of equal parts impending danger and chronic screw ups is set right from the start, with a lit-fuse pace throughout the movie. Every scene is tight. The sound, the lighting, the dialog,the music, the performances. Every character actor is well-chosen. So many ingredients to enjoy: adventure, humor, mysterious locations, romance, explosions. Only a Nazi could not enjoy this film!"
ccthemovieman-1,"Oct 23, 2006",10/10,"All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one was still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, famous scenes - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Harrison Ford - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years. In fact, to sum it all up: hundreds of years from now, I wouldn't be surprised if this is still considered one of the great adventure films of all time.The action scenes are varied, which means a lot. You don't get the same kind of jolt of adventure. You get fist fights, battles with snakes, with airplane propellers, guns, knives, poison dates, fires, supernatural plague-type winds, chases through city streets, caves, mountains....you name it, it's all in here.This movie can wear you out, which is almost a negative. The music can get too loud, the action too much, Karen Allen's mouth too profane; the credibility too much to believe, the theology too weird, etc, but no one can deny this is a fun ride all the way through. You take none of it seriously and just enjoy the adventure.Coming on the heels of Star Wars, this really made Harrison Ford a mega-star. It didn't do much for the rest of the cast but it sure boosted Ford's stock.After a long wait, this finally came out on DVD in October of 2003 and it looks great!"
BA_Harrison,"Jun 19, 2010",10/10,"Inspired by the movies and serials enjoyed by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas in their youth, Raiders Of The Lost Ark is a relentless roller-coaster of a film that sees the bearded movie moguls expertly combining action, romance, horror, adventure, fantasy and comedy; as far as pure entertainment value goes, it doesn't get much better than this.Unlike in their later adventures for Harrison Ford's heroic archaeologist, the pair pitch the level of escapism perfectly, stretching believability to the limits occasionally, but never exceeding them (there's no flying fridges or death defying falls over a cliff in a rubber dinghy in this one). Apart from seriously underestimating the weight of gold (Indy even takes some sand out of the bag he uses to replace a solid gold idol) and expecting the audience to accept that a U-Boat would travel hundreds of miles without submerging, the film is pretty flawless, with classic scene after classic scene brilliantly executed by a Spielberg in his prime.Not yet in his forties, Harrison Ford is still young enough to give the character his all (mind you, being well into his sixties today doesn't seem to have stopped him trying), and he is given able support by a solid cast that includes John Rhys-Davies as brave Egyptian Sallah, Denholm Elliott as fellow history nut Dr. Marcus Brody, Paul Freeman as reprehensible archaeologist Dr. René Belloq, and Karen Allen as Jones's spunky sidekick Marion Ravenwood. As well as terrific performances, the film also boasts superb old-school stunts (ie., pre-CGI), excellent visual effects from Richard Edlund, and even some delightfully gruesome moments that might prove too much for some little ones: a man is impaled on spears, a German soldier is reduced to a red mist by propeller blades, faces are melted, and there is even an exploding head!!! Now that's what I call quality family entertainment!"
david-59494,"Jun 16, 2023",10/10,"Fantastic film, from start to finish. The pinnacle of what many have since referred to as the second coming of ""the golden age of cinema"".Not only does it pace well, and keep you on the edge of your seat, it also plays to a wide audience range. From kids to adults, this film is highly marketable - probably a reason behind its both financial and critical acclaim.Spielberg set out, as I understand, to produce a one-time summer blockbuster, which has turned into one of the most beloved franchises of all time.No doubt the original is the best - although it remains to be seen with the 5th due to come out soon..."
jmmustchin,"Apr 15, 2018",10/10,"Frankly one of the best movies ever made! The plot, the excitement, the acting - it's all brilliant! Definitely the best Lucas film ever made, and definitely one of Spielberg's best. It leaves the viewer feeling quite exhilarated and exhausted - in a good way.
Indiana Jones - in his first (chronologically second) movie adventure - must jump into action to save the Ark of the Covenant from being found and taken by the Nazis, who want to use it for world domination.
The film is not historically accurate, but quite fun nonetheless."
TxMike,"Jun 1, 2000",N/A,"Although my review is dated June 2000, when I originally posted my comments, what I am writing now (January 2023) are entirely new comments, having just watched this movie for the 438th time. Well, I exaggerate a bit!Now I like to look at the movie two ways. First, the core story. We have a mild-mannered 30-something Dr. Jones, professor of Archaeology who as a side job searches for Antiquities. His arch-rival Belloq yet again steals a valuable item that Jones has just discovered, but back home is approached about a new challenge, The Ark of the Covenant which they believe Hitler's men are on the verge of discovering.So the core story is an American ""good vs evil"", of getting the best of the Nazis and preserving a valuable artifact for the civilized world. The mild-mannered professor springs into action and shows he cannot be defeated, whether by fist or by use of his trusty bullwhip.The second way is the style of the movie. Although Spielberg was already in his mid-30s he had only a few years earlier directed ""Jaws"" and ""Close Encounters."" We didn't have the internet back in 1981, we generally knew very little about actors and directors. Now that we do, and understand how Spielberg started of as a youngster making movies at home, his style in ""Raiders"" now makes more sense.While the subject is serious the movie is shot in a grand Saturday matinee adventure style. Lots of action, lots of humor, and playing fast and loose with customs and morals. When you re-watch it a lot certain things are very obvious, like the remotely activated pole that causes the truck to turn over, or the trench under the low-speed truck when Jones is working his way to the rear. And a few other things.Frankly, re-watching in now (2023) the movie doesn't have the luster that I remember when I saw it in the theater 40 years ago. My memory of ""Raiders"" is better than the movie really is. But I still consider it to be one of the best adventure movies of all time. Harrison Ford has been just perfect as Indiana Jones and I will continue to watch it every 2 or 3 years.I've seen it so many times now I find myself saying certain lines with them, ""They're digging in the wrong place!"" Many reviews focus on how unrealistic some elements are, but that is part of the fantasy, a professor by day fighting off innumerable Nazis. This is more an escape movie than anything else, just a fantasy to watch and enjoy."

csm-78119,"Dec 27, 2019",10/10,Great thrill ride from start to finish with Ford and Allen perfect in the lead roles. Full of ingenious cliffhangers and iconic set piece scenes. One of Spielberg's finest films. Imitated but never bettered.
RonellSowes,"Oct 23, 2022",7/10,"The main intent of Raiders of the Lost Ark is to be a fun adventurous ride and you have to give it that. The film kicks of the action right from the beginning and goes from one to another over the course of the film slowing down only for a moment and keeping exposition to a minimum. However, while the film keeps it all under two hours it does feel a bit much. From the number of set-piece to the size of each. Each one builds from one thing to the next getting more extravagant as it continues into a bit of mumbo-jumbo. This was the start of extensive and wild action scenes in both Spielberg's career and all of cinema. While the movie is undoubtedly a classic, its influence (which is on almost every action movie made after it) has been more negative. Raiders of the Lost Ark tried to make movies funner but it also made them dumber.Pretty much all the other characters in it are cartoonish but Harrison Ford is, of course, great as the movies biggest appeal: Indiana Jones."
kenjha,"Dec 26, 2012",4/10,"It starts with a scene that would have us believe that an ancient civilization implemented a high-tech security system to safeguard an idol. Yes, the movie is exciting but the action is so utterly ridiculous that it makes James Bond films and ""The Road Runner"" cartoons look realistic. While it's understandable that one has to suspend disbelief when watching a film, the level of stupidity suggests that Spielberg has no respect for the viewer's intelligence. Scenes such as Jones's stunt under the moving vehicle and the revelation of the contents of the ark are sure to have any adult viewer rolling his eyes so often that there's danger of collapsing from dizziness."
gwzct,"Aug 27, 2022",10/10,"...It's one of the greatest movies of all time. Humor, heart, story, adventure, action, a director and a star actor at the pinnacle of their game. It's absolutely a classic and a masterpiece. Even a casual movie fan could watch this multiple times. It has aged like fine wine and, quite simply, they just don't make movies like this anymore. It's one of those movies that shows us why we shell out our hard earned cash to watch movies in a theater. As an added bonus, a lot of Nazis get punched and dispatched. I have been watching this movie for decades and I'm never not interested in every single second. Such a legendary film."
LennyReviewz,"Mar 1, 2023",8/10,"When I look at Harrison Ford, I think Indiana Jones first and Han Solo second.An Iconic film franchise, that's still going strong today. We kick it off with this classic first entry: Raiders of The Lost Ark.Let me start off by saying, any film in which the Nazis get their butts kicked, is already a great film.The charisma and intelligence of Indiana Jones makes him a very easy character to like. Right from the get go, we see him at the tail end of an adventure. We see what he is capable of, and we find out his biggest fear. He hates snakes.Raiders is an action heavy in the first half of the movie and in my opinion, they find the Ark way too easy. It becomes a ""catch me if you can"" in the second half of the movie. This is essentially what I call the Indiana Jones formula. All the films follow this formula, maybe not in order, but they do the same thing. That isn't a bad thing, but I'll admit, it's very formulaic and kind of predictable.My favorite scene in Raiders has always been the market scene and the final scene. The sword versus gun bit, always puts a smile on my face. The faces melting and explosions in the final scene is part of cinematic history.You can really tell Harrison Ford loves playing the role. He really shines as Indy. His supporting cast in this one does a phenomenal job as well. The chemistry between him and Karen Allen is undeniable. John Rhys-Davies (played Sallah) and Denholm Elliot (played Dr. Marcus Brody), are such good characters as well (albeit very minor).Indiana Jones is part of cinematic history, as such it is required viewing for anyone with a brain.This film gets a Lenny Reviewz Score of: 8.5/10."

I-want-a-Swedish-Girlfriend,"Apr 21, 2025",10/10,"Of COURSE a TEN. German & born in 1980, here. Why isn't every single movie like Indiana Jones I - III ? We don't know the future. As a result, movie makers might stay away from Sci-Fi. Well, if you stay away from Sci-Fi, then how isn't every single other movie, I pay money for, like Indiana Jones ? A mind blowing adventure ? There is a reason. I'm trying to remember how I felt when I watched that gem and the whole trilogy on a repeat loop. I felt: That's all there is. That's how brutal my mindset was. Those adventures blow in fact your mind. But there couldn't be more than three good movies on this planet (save Sci Fi). Three good movies is the entirety of planet earth. That's how dark the 80s were in Germany. It was completely unimaginable that there could be more than three good adventures. Ever."
EVON1TY,"Jun 25, 2019",6/10,"These propaganda movies are telling us ""Germans are not humans."" and it is just silly. This movie built on a lie and real bad story.

JimiGamerBoy123,"Mar 26, 2024",10/10,"When me and my brother and sisters first watched this movie, we were all enjoying all the different things inside it like the first fight scenes, people getting shot and blown up, some skeleton images, how the villain watched a lady change into a former dress in the movie! The bar fight scene was so hilarious and awesome, and how Major Toht was getting beat up as well, I would recommended watching this movie for all Indiana Jones fans and obsessed fans. This movie along with the rest of the Indiana Jones movie series are all extremely good. Even though the first three movies are rated PG and the remainder of the movies are rated PG-13, all of these films should have given an R rating for the blood and gore inside the movies, but nothing scares us, these are awesome movies! How we are not scared of people getting shot, stabbed, blown up or melted like Toht and the rest at the near end of the movie, I would really watch this again over and over, with my family and the clips of this movie and the rest. I would highly recommend the makers have given these movies an R rating for sensitivity of strong violence, frightening images and substance of bare nudity. Not gonna lie, this along with all of the rest of the Indiana Jones movies are really good!"
akoaytao1234,"Mar 12, 2024",6/10,"Raiders tells the story of Indiana Jones, as he try to get the Lost Ark before the Nazi could.It did just not resonate with me. I guess in the grand scheme of great films, I mean this like a film and popular culture that is referenced to a point that it feels like you know it without really watching it. But unlike say Saturday Night Fever, this really feels so surface level and lacking of subtext.It does not feel like it is trying to say something BUT rather show a spectacle. Like other Spielberg film, I thought this film is well-made but there is something stilted about its storytelling, sexual dynamics and even overall morality. Its just a Hero's Journey story that you kind of wish that it at least tried to be edgy maybe or add some complication.It just feels like something I will forget.Not recommended."
Gubby-Allen,"Jan 14, 2002",3/10,"I'm not going to spend much time on this as I am obviously in a massive minority by not liking it. It's taken me 20 years to finally see this film through to the end.It just bores me completely. It's a part James Bond film, which I've never had any time for. It doesn't seem any better than the 'Mummy' or 'Tomb Raider' type films (ZZZZZZ) where the dialogue is largely incidental & which you can watch with the volume turned down and still follow. They generally concern some pre-historic torch, urn, key, lump of dog turd, that has special powers, that the hero needs to get his hands on & that just doesn't make for an interesting film.I just cannot get into films like this & never have any interests whether they achieve what they're after. In this there were a lot of scenes which seemed to be filling in time. First the Nazi's had the initiative, then Jones, then back to the Nazi's again and this went on & on & on, to the point that it wasn't dis-similar from a Steven Seagal or Van Damme film. Apart from the obvious superior quality of acting in this, the fighting scenes were sometimes laughable.Karen Allen threw in some incredibly wooden acting in her cliched lines she was given. The ""I'm your partner"" was almost cringe making.There seems an unwritten rule that you are not allowed to comment on Raiders of the Lost Ark without mentioning Star Wars for some reason. So I love Harrison Ford films, I like George Lucas & certainly don't dislike Spielberg. Thus, I have Star Wars as one of only a dozen films in my list at 10/10, it's almost perfect. I myself, wouldn't mention this in the same breath as Star Wars. You immediately feel a part of Star Wars & it's wonderful characters, neither of which apply here.This film has never taken off in England to the extent it has done in the US. I know plenty of adults who've never seen it & many who are not mad over it.But I'll admit I've never found anyone who genuinely dislikes it. Apart from me!3/10"

jordondave-28085,"Dec 5, 2023",8/10,"(1981) Raiders of the Lost Ark
ACTION ADVENTUREThe first of five Indiana Jones action adventure movies that opens with archeologist, Indy (Harrison Ford) along with some guides attempting to grab a golden artifact while exploring inside of a cave from some South American jungle. And by the time, Indy escapes the cave with the amulet, he is then waiting for him is fellow archaeologist, Belloq (Paul Freeman) waiting outside to take the amulet from him surrounded with natives pointing their arrows at him. And just as they are about to kill him, Indy manages to distract them before he escapes through the jungle onto a floater plane. It appears his fellow peer Belloq is working for the Nazis. Indy is back at the US again instructing his students, and is approached by US agents about instructions involving finding and locating the lost ark before the Nazis do. . The first name Indy is supposed to meet happens to live in Nepal, and by the time he goes their, it turns out he is deceased and that he has a daughter named Marion (Karen Allen) who runs a bar. Coincidentally, it also happens to the time the Nazis show up and try to recover the medallion Indy was looking for. A scuffle happens with the bar burned down to the ground with Indy escaping with Marion with the medallion that is supposed to pin point where the lost ark was buried.Although, entertaining some of the influential scenes also include Indy crawling underneath the truck carrying the ark that stunt is reminiscent to the stunt performed by Yakima Canutt from ""Stagecoach""; and the one scene with the guy waving a machete before Indy pulls out his gun was already shown before on a movie called ""Seven"" released in 1979. Is used for great effect here."
AlsExGal,"Feb 11, 2025",9/10,"Meant as a homage to the action adventure serials of the 1930s - except with much better production values - this film is practically a master class in movie writing.The opening part of the film focuses on character development. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is first seen as an adventurer in the jungles of South America in 1936 looking for a rare antiquity that is surrounded and protected by deadly booby traps . This is also where the audience is introduced to Belloq. Through their confrontation Belloq is seen as being in this strictly for the money and having no problem killing people to get his way where Indy wants the antiquity in a museum where all can see it. Then, Indy is seen back in the United States as a professor of archeology, looking very nerdy and ""Clark Kent"" like, teaching a class to bored male students and infatuated female students who write ""love you"" on their eyelids.Then the conflict is introduced - two Army intelligence officers visit ""Indy"" at the university to talk about how the Nazis are doing some kind of archaeological dig in Egypt that Indy deduces to be a search for the lost Ark of the Covenant which is supposed to give the army that carries it vast conquering powers. So Indy is off on a global trek to investigate.This is less than 25 minutes into the film, but it's already set up the main characters and the conflict of the rest of the film. From that point on it focuses on the action and the spectacle as everything else has been well introduced.For example, first, we see Indy afraid of one snake in the opening sequence. Later, he's in a tomb with thousands of them. Indy describes the Well of the Souls and the power of the Ark to the G-men at the university. Later, we see the exact scene in the Well of the Souls that he described, and it's a really spectacular moment.The movie has the perfect balance of action and comedy. There are a lot of complex action scenes (the bazaar fight, the fight at the airstrip and the truck chase). The scenes are well-choreographed and the stakes are always set high.It has only one basic flaw - Nobody took the Nazis very seriously in 1936. They were talking big but hadn't really done anything to back up that talk at this point, and yet everyone is talking like it's 1940. But that's just me being a stickler for detail. I would still highly recommend it."
georgistamateev,"Oct 22, 2023",10/10,"When the guy that made ""Star Wars"" and the guy that made ""Jaws"", said thet they are making a movie, everyone thought it was too good to be true, but here we are with the best action adventure movie of all time.Let's start with the elphant in the room - Steven Spielberg. Every shot of the movie is goregous and he does a terrific job with the movie. Now let's talk abot George Lucas. Legends sat that in the opening weekend of ""Star Wars"", Lucas and Spielberg went on a hoilday together and on the beach, George asked Steven, about the movies he plans to make and he said that he wanted to make a James Bind film, but George said that he had something better in mind. That's when he said his brilliant idea for the archeologist ""Indiana Smith"" (they later changed the name, because Spielberg didn't like it). You can say whatever you want about him as a director, but he makes a hell of a good stories, not scripts, stories.Harrison Ford is brilliant and he is the perfect fit for Indiana Jones. At first, lucas didn't want him, because he was already in most of his movies, but no matter that, they decited (i don't know to spell it) to pick him, which was a great choice. Karen Allen is also really good in her role, as well as Paul Freeman and the other actors.And it would not be a full review, if i don't talk about John Williams and his score for the movie. It's simply on of the best scores ever.However, there is one thing that i didn't like about this movie, but it's not a flaw, just a little nitpick. In the end, when they are opening the Ark, the whole time, Indy is tied and he does nothing, but still a really beautiful sequence. I am not going to give it lower score, just because of that, but i wanted to say it.Simply this is one of the movies ever made. The action, the score, the direction, everything is great and that's why this is my favourite movie of all time."
august_sanders,"Mar 16, 2025",7/10,"The Raiders of the Lost Arc is interesting enough to get my attention. Their main reason I watched this movie is because my economics teacher was so into Indiana jones that he has every poster around the room in his class. Since I value his opinion I decided to give it a go and it was pretty good. The action was definitely the best part and the story was complete with, much my excitement, had so character development though minimal. As Indy worked through his fight with the nazis he grew as a person and became less self centered by risking his life for the girl that I can't remember the name of. It was a good showing of what makes a good action movie aside from action."
lagudafuad,"Nov 9, 2012",7/10,"Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first of the Indiana Jones franchise that spawn out 3 sequels, a TV series and numerous video games. It is a classic and stood above many in the box office raking in over $380 million dollars. It also won 4 Academy Awards for Best Visual Effects, Best Sound, Best Film Editing and Best Art Direction.The movie pulls surprises after surprises, like what happened when the Ark was opened, that scene alone is not something you will expect as it starts from the time it was opened till when it was shut, you will be stunned.It packages in its 115 minutes run, a bolder chase, arrow flying here and there, submarine, car chase, gun fights, drama, comedy, adventure, Nazis, Gestapo, Arabian men and Spiritual power in high places, all this for your fun and view, in a movie that is shot in numerous locations.There was a scene where Indy is trapped in the well of souls with over 7,000 snakes, now that is a sight you really want to see. The car chase reminded me of the Mad Max movie Road Warrior it was intense, fun and dangerous.The movie plot has our favorite hero, trying to get a solid-gold idol somewhere in the Peruvian jungle in 1936. He gets it then loses the artifact to his rival and the movie antagonist who is French archaeologist named Belloq (Paul Freeman).Indy is recruited by the Army Intelligence to stop the Nazi's who seem to be after the Ark of Covenant so as to gain power to topple the world.So Indy saddles up and goes to Nepal to meet with his Mentor Ravenwood only to discover that he had died, so he is left to ride along Marion (Karen Allen) his daughter to Cairo where they meet Indy's sidekick Sallah (John Rhys-Davies) as they team up to stop the Nazis.The movie is one joy ride from place to place the movie had quite an interesting bunch of characters that will keep you both thrilled and entertained, one character that catches my fancy was the Gestapo. Raiders of the Lost Ark is set to be a sequel to the movie that came after it, as Temple of Doom was set in 1935. The movie has received numerous acclaim ranked 66 in the AFI's top 100 movies 10th Anniversary and also ranked 10th in AFI's top ten thrills.Here is Indiana Jones at the very beginning an intro to the character that we all love and admire, I believe there is no reason why you should not have seen this classic.www.lagsreviews.com"

eloani7,"Aug 24, 2023",8/10,Great movie to watch over and over again with the family and people around you. It's one of those movies that never gets old. They don't make movies like this anymore. No matter what age you will love all of the Indiana Jones movies. Movies like this is what makes me go to the theater. From the music to the actors to the writers to every single person involved. We need more movies like this to continue going to the theaters. It brings back the old-school feeling of how movies used to be made. Love it keep making movies like this. It does not matter with like this or you are or what country you live in movies like this is what make Hollywood.
DVD_Connoisseur,"Aug 5, 2008",10/10,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is as entertaining now as it was back in 1981. In fact, it makes today's adventure films with their smörgåsbord of CGI effects look rather lack lustre in comparison.With a breathtaking pace, splendid script and some of the best lines you'll ever hear in a movie of this nature, Spielberg's movie is a riot.Harrison Ford was born to play this character - it's difficult to imagine anyone else in the role of Dr. Jones. The cast includes a wonderfully feisty Karen Allen, the always dependable Denholm Elliott and a larger-than-life and instantly likable John Rhys-Davies. The baddies include Indy's nemesis Belloq (Paul Freeman) and Toht (a fantastically slippery performance from Ronald Lacey.With a memorable score by John Williams and enough set pieces to keep any action fan entertained, this is the creme de la creme of the genre.10 out of 10."

XweAponX,"Sep 21, 2025",10/10,"And I'm pretty sure there were no intro title credits.In fact, the way this film was promoted and then finally released had nothing to do with any upcoming franchise. I remember seeing the first trailer for this film when we were seeing Excalibur and Dragonslayer. It was promoted just like a 1940 republic serial and that's how the film started out.My friend and I walked in through an open side door.We had no idea what we were going to be watching.But the whole teaser or the film had not one single title credit.That's what made the film interesting, and then suddenly we're looking for the Ark of the Covenant.We didn't know who Karen Allen was either, and at the time we did not know who John Reese Davies was.But from the moment we walked into that theater until the time we kind of wobbled out, we were amazed.A couple of years later, they made a sequel that was loosely based upon Gunga Din, and I thought that film was just about as good, but they did overbloated promotion by suddenly making the whole thing an ""Indiana Jones"" adventure. And we were expecting more Karen Allen. I liked the kid though, he ended up being in Loki and everything everywhere all at once.But nobody knew at the time that this was going to explode into five feature films, and I have enjoyed all of them, especially the last one which went right back to the roots that were planted in this film."

Steven Spielberg doing an amazing job with the directing, the score composed by John Williams is too iconic to ignore, Harrison Ford is awesome and there were a lot of great scenes."
jace_the_film_guy,"Nov 27, 2021",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark never ceases to amaze me. From the first moments in the Peruvian temple, I was immediately invested in Dr. Jones and his quest for precious artifacts. With a great story, an iconic score and one of the best directors of all time, this film is a treasure. Harrison Ford is charming and the rest of the cast does a great job supporting.The action scenes are exceptionally done, especially for a film made in the 1980's. Raiders of the Lost Ark is a film that I could watch over and over without losing interest. The film is legendary!"
josephrygaard,"Aug 11, 2019",7/10,"""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" (1981) is undoubtedly an iconic adventure classic. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:Raiders of the Lost Ark is a thrill ride, but some aspects leave a few things to be wanted. The editing during the movie's first half can be a bit choppy at times, and a few plot details throughout the film are somewhat illogical. The villains are quite one-dimensional, and a certain sequence has a very clear use of greenscreen as well. The more of a nitpicker one is, the more this will be bothering, but all aspects named can be overlooked with any major effort.A warning should however be issued to those who are sensitive to blood and gruesome effects. The opening feature some stark images in this category, there is a shoot-out scene early on that doesn't shy away from this either, and the infamous ending is surprisingly brutal and gory when compared to the overall lighter mood of the movie. It has currently a PG rating, but a PG-13 rating would be more appropriate as the violence alone pushes the movie into R areas at said times.Finally, the iconic status of Raiders of the Lost Ark derives mostly from its cult position as well as its 80's nostalgia. At the time, this was clearly groundbreaking in most of its areas, but today, its technical features are matched more and more often within the genre. Nevertheless, Indiana Jones' charisma still hits home, and ultimately, the portrayed adventures has maintained their excitements. Don't rush into to the following sequel at the cost of appreciating this one, as Temple of Doom fails drastically to deliver entertainment of the same level.My personal grade: an entertaining 7/10.

nandor2,"Nov 29, 2006",5/10,"So, I'm sure no one agrees with me, but this is not one of the greatest movies ever made. It's OK. Downright mediocre.The one thing it has going for it is the action element. And if you've seen any modern action movies, it'll feel like this movie's moving at 2 miles per hour. It starts off well, and then, it gets really slow.There's some funny parts, but they're spread out, so boredom can ensue.It's supposed to be charming because well, it's Harrison Ford, and it is, but only to an extent, and once again, be wary of slowness.I'm not saying slow movies are bad. I'm saying slow movies that are written like action movies kind of are. I think ""Last Crusade"" is much more polished than this one."
rafael_nobrega,"May 30, 2022",8/10,"I have watched this movie dozens of times when i was young. The first time was when a had 5 years old. I watched this last week again with my son that have 5 years old, and this movie was fun as decades ago. The evolution of the history is very good! The protagonist is perfect for the role! Long live to Harrison!"

narutofanz,"Nov 21, 2018",8/10,This is a famous classic action packed film. I don't say this often but this film is definitely a must watch if you haven't seen it because it's just so perfect and has that charm to it.
blanbrn,"May 21, 2008",8/10,"After many years I just once again viewed the start of the ""Indiana Jones"" saga that being the first film made in the series 1981's ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" watching it as a kid was more enjoyable, but still the film is a joy ride to watch due to it's nonstop action and thrills it provides. In a way this is a classic B type movie that pays tribute to something you would see just for outright fun with it's action and thrills. And hand it to the master of adventure and escape that being Steven Spielberg who with his direction just sweeps a viewer up off their feet. Plus combined with his teamwork of George Lucas who produced and helped add facts into the story the two maybe made the best adventure series of memory.Set in 1936 Harrison Ford as archaeologist and part time adventurer Indiana Jones decides to part out from his college to meet up with his feisty ex Marion Ravenwood(Karen Allen)and they plan a search for the powerful and mystical Ark of the Covenant. Along the way their biggest challenge will be fighting the religious crazed Nazis plus add in dodging booby-traps, and staring down deadly snakes. This film scene after scene is a thrill ride a true cliffhanger of adventure and joyful excitement. This would clearly be the icon role that Harrison Ford is most remembered for as his ""Indy"" role is more respected than his ""Han Solo"" role in the ""Star Wars"" films. Overall great action adventure film one of the best made of all-time."

a_chinn,"Nov 26, 2021",10/10,"No story summary is needed for this film since everyone has seen it (if you haven't, go watch it RIGHT NOW!). I saw this in the theater as a kid and it made my mind explode. This viewing was at a pandemic drive-in showing at the fairgrounds with my kids, so it was not the most optimal of setting to watch the film. The sound was broadcast over the radio, which was terrible and we ended up not using, and listening to it over the fairground speakers was only slightly better. The picture quality was so dark you could barely make out what was happening on screen anytime a scene was remotely dark or shadowy, which is fair portion of the film. So although I was highly annoyed this poor presentation poisoned my kids' interest watching further Indiana Jones films, I do still dearly love this film. The script by Lawrence Kasdan (""Empire Strikes Back"" ""The Big Chill"" ""Body Heat"" ""Silverado"" ""The Accidental Tourist"" ""The Bodyguard"") from a story by George Lucas (""Star Wars"") and Phillip Kaufman (""The Right Stuff""), the film is pure H. Rider Haggard with an updated Allan Quatermain in the form of globe trotting archeologist adventure-seeker Indiana Jones searching for treasure, punching Nazis, and saving the world from hidden supernatural forces. As corny as all that sounds, what make ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" such a classic is the perfect casting of Harrison Ford, exhilarating direction from Steven Spielberg, and an iconic film score from John Williams. Taking first the casting of Harrison Ford, my favorite measure of a great performance is if you cannot picture any other actor in a role and Ford as Indiana Jones is about the most perfect example of this. Ford pulls off so many great moments, from his expression after the shoot-the-swordsman scene to a later moment in the film where he grudgingly accepts help from Marion (another great bit of casting with Karen Allen) and tells her where it hurts, Ford strikes a unique balance of a character who is both a superman and an everyman. Indiana Jones really is a unique hero for 80s action films, which were primarily populated by invincible Rambos, Conans, or Dirty Harrys. Simply stated, Ford IS Indiana Jones and no one else could have filled that role (but fun fact, Tom Selleck was the original first choice for the role, which wouldn't have been all that bad). As for Spielberg's direction, he captures a pitch perfect tone for the film, balancing its mix of cliffhanger serial films, but treating it like a serious action thriller, nicely updating an old style story with big budget production values, modern stunt work, and contemporary filmmaking techniques and special effects. Whether audiences appreciate throwback touches such as the Peter Lorre analogue Toth or Paul Freeman's Belloq as a stand in for a Claud Raines/James Mason type of suave charming villain, Spielberg litters the film with wonderful small nods to classic Hollywood. He's masterfully crafted a film that's equal parts nostalgic throwback and also something wholly original that had never been done before (treating pulp as serious material). And there are so many great small touches, such as making Indy a little human with an irrational fear of snakes or allowing Indy to be vulnerable allowing Marion to patch his wounds, which is also a testament to Ford's acting skills. A personal favorite little touch is having Indy wear leather gloves when he has his epic fist fight with a musclebound Nazi, which is a badass aesthetic that really needs to come back into fashion in more action flicks. Simply speaking, Spielberg knows film language down to small details in a way few filmmakers can replicate. As for John Williams score, the trumpets for ""Indy's Theme"" are just as iconic as his themes for ""Jaws,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Superman,"" ""Harry Potter"" or innumerable other films he's indelibly left his mark. It's impossible to imaging another composer scoring an Indiana Jones film. Those are the main reasons this is such a great film, but I'd be remiss not to mention the terrific supporting cast that includes Karen Allen as Marion, Paul Freeman as Belloq, Ronald Lacey as Toht, John Rhys-Davies as Sallah, as well as Denholm Elliott and Alfred Molina in a memorable small part at the start of the film before he was famous. Overall, I will admit I have an unhealthy amount of childhood nostalgia for this film, but adolescent bias aside, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is arguably one of the greatest action films of all time."
benxrichardson,"Sep 15, 2021",7/10,I watched Raiders for the first time in 2021 and it wasn't as good as I was expecting. This iconic action movie is just non stop and I think that is it's biggest flaw. It doesn't stop to catch a breath and build a storyline and develop characters.
dilipbts,"Aug 8, 2020",9/10,Nowadays we keep forgetting how beautiful blockbusters can be. Too much CGI makes everything possible and therefore very often also arbitrary. In Raiders you actually seem to feel the physical pain some of the actors/stuntmen had to go through to provide 2 hours of pure entertainment.

chelsey-90705,"Mar 23, 2024",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark follows the adventures of renowned archaeologist Dr. Indiana Jones, portrayed by Harrison Ford. He is in a race against the Nazis to find an artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant.On his journey, he reunites with his former lover, Marion Ravenwood, portrayed by Karen Allen. Together, they travel from Nepal to Egypt in search of the artifact. The Nazis are working with Indiana Jones' arch nemesis French archaeologist, Dr. Rene Belloq, portrayed by Paul Freeman. The Nazis are also trying to find the Ark of the Covenant to use the power of the Ark for their evil purposes.The movie's theme, and many to follow, revolve around the quest for knowledge and the battle between good and evil. Indiana Jones is a spirited adventurer who risks his life to uncover ancient artifacts. He is also a professor at Marshall College. The film focuses on courage, sacrifice, defining true heroism, and the thirst for knowledge. It also shows the consequences of pursuing power and that good triumphs over evil.Throughout the film, Indiana Jones is deciphering ancient books and relics, exploring dangerous hidden temples, and discovering many artifacts. He shares his quest for knowledge with his students and others in his profession.He sells museums the artifacts to aid his future expeditions and share these priceless artifacts with the world. He repeatedly risks his life to protect others and prevent the Nazis from obtaining the Ark. His bravery and courage are often displayed throughout the movie. He risks his life to rescue Marion several times in the movie, such as at her bar in Nepal, in Egypt when they captured her, and at the Nazi camp. He has high morals and understands self-sacrifice for the greater good.Ultimately, the Nazis open the Ark, unleashing supernatural forces that consume them.This scene shows the consequences of pursuing power for evil. The Nazis did not understand or respect the Ark leading to their demise. Other films have the same premise, such as Indiana Jones movies and The Mummy (1999). In The Mummy, the characters driven by greed and power end up dying, whereas the characters pursuing the artifacts in quest of knowledge survive.In the film, costume design and set design play a significant role in immersing the viewer. The iconic designs by Indiana Jones, such as his fedora, leather jacket, and whip, show practical uses and symbolize his courage, resourcefulness, and heroism. Many scenes depict Indiana using his whip as a weapon and tool. This is displayed in scenes when he brushes the spiders off, using it as a rope to swing across the crevasse and fight off bad guys throughout the film.The sets are intricate and well thought out to include authenticity and realism. This can be seen in bar scenes, the streets of Cairo, and ancient temples Indiana explores.In summary, this film is thrilling and adventurous. It explores timeless themes of courage, integrity, the pursuit of knowledge, and the importance of good overcoming evil. There have been many films before and after it that encompass the same qualities; however, the unique editing and utilization of different sound techniques make it a timeless film that all can enjoy. I watched the film with my four children, ages 16 to 4 years old. They all enjoyed the characters, constant action, and particularly the sounds of the film."
TimT,"Nov 23, 1998",10/10,"This movie not only is one of the best of its genre, but also much imitated and often envied.  The main character is still venerated and immediately recognizable, not to mention a line by which others are judged.Truly a classic."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 26, 2023",8/10,"George Lucas was a master filmmaker. He knew how to entertain the audience, and he knew how to sustain a good action scene. In Raiders, Lucas uses Harrison Ford like a Japanese chef uses a knife. We get introduced to this timeless character for this and several other sequels. The formula is the same: Indy becomes intrigued with some type of archeological problem that makes him leave the classroom and go on wild adventures. I should be so lucky; I never got to leave my university students. The formula worked time after time.Add the best bad guys of all time (the Nazis) and you have a can't miss film."
zayrap,"Mar 24, 2024",10/10,"Dr Jones, Indiana Jones played by Harrison Ford, is an archaeologist and part time professor who goes on a mission to get the Ark of the Covenant before Nazi forces retrieve because of the power it is believed to have. Indiana Jones has an arch-nemesis in this film, Rene Belloq, played by Paul Freeman. He is also an archaeologist and the main antagonist in the film. He is Indiana Jones enemy, who is very smart and helps the Nazis search for the Ark of the Covenant. Upon discovering that the Nazis are also on the hunt for the Ark in Egypt, Indiana Jones then reunites with a former love interest and they team up together to try and get to the Ark first. Marion Ravenwood played by Karen Allen, is the former romantic interest of Indiana Jones. This story continues with Indiana Jones going on adventures and facing his rivals and facing many difficulties along the way.The two main themes of Raiders of the Lost Ark are the fight between good vs. Evil and exploration. Indiana Jones is very selfless and portrays the ""good"" guy well throughout the film. He is willing to risk his life to get the ark before the Nazis, he is fearless and willing to find knowledge no matter it takes by going on life-risking adventures. Whereas the evil guys in the film are the Nazis and Belloq."
bryangary65,"Sep 24, 2025",7/10,"Good fun movie with some decent stunts though not many carried out by its main star Harrison Ford, but looks a bit jaded now with some B movie wooden acting. Visually the film looks decent with some nice locations
Must admit I enjoyed it more on its first release in the cinema back in 1981, and therefore probably not too bothered about catching up on the rest of the trilogies."
MJB784,"Apr 1, 2024",9/10,"No list of action movies is complete without Indiana Jones! One of Steven Spielberg's greatest movies in his career, the first of five Indiana Jones movies has many classic scenes and edge of your seat moments that remain thrilling in every viewing. Though, I'll admit that not every scene holds up, it's hard to not have fun watching this movie. Here, Indy is trying to find the Ark of the Convenant and runs into an old flame of his named Marian because he needs a piece from a artifact her father took from him. Nazis are on their tail trying to rid of them and the Ark which contains a spellbinding sequence of secrets when the two leads are tied to a poll in my favorite part of the movie!"
damovie6,"Dec 25, 2024",7/10,"When I watched it for the first time I was blown away, but, watching it for the second time? Not so much.I still like the opening scene, it's cool/iconic and so is the chase scene in Cairo. The rest of the first hour is somewhat dull, because most of it is just slow, not that interesting and kinda exposition heavy. The second hour gets really good with all the action set pieces and whatnot.As for the characters, Indy is cool, but he doesn't really go through anything, and Marion is a really good female character.Sallah is very likeable, and Belloq is a good villain.Overall, not as good as I remember it to be, but it's still to some extent a fun time.7/10."
mohlerterry,"May 21, 2024",10/10,"There is no denying that ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is one of the greatest movies in the action/adventure genre. It's one of the most impressive, most memorable, and most dynamically entertaining films I have ever experienced. George Lucas and Lawrence Kasdan delivered lots of unexpected surprises to the whole script, and these surprises just kept on coming. The script is complemented by the slick and elaborate direction by Steven Spielberg. What makes ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" stand out in the action/adventure genre, as well as for a winner for fans of this genre, is how smart it is; the film consistently throws in perilous obstacles to keep the film exciting, and we will never know what is coming, and when something happens, it really pays off. Even on repeat viewings, it is still unpredictable and satisfying in every way. Not to mention that the skillful craftsmanship on display will make it an inspiring film for those who want to be a filmmaker for the action/adventure genre.The production design is arresting and tangible, while the sound effects are gripping. From the audacious stunts, to the hard-hitting impact, and to the astonishing effects, The action sequences deliver a lot of sprightly momentum. The unintentionally comedic moments are clever in structure and quite gut-busting in execution, and I laughed at all of these comedic moments. I must add that no animals were hamred in the making of this film, including the snakes. They all spawned a dynamic adventure yarn that is altogether exhilarating, audacious, intelligent, and hilarious. Driven by high energy and melodic emotion, The dramatically invigorating music score by John Williams enhances the film entirely, as it vividly captures every element, and it strongly supports the film's genre and it's theme of heroism.The all of the characters have both brains and brawn that are equally matched. But each of them are distinct in personality. Also, the performances are first-rate indeed, and the interactions between the characters are intriguing and fun to watch. Both the protagonists and the antagonists are archeologists, but different in nationalities; the heroes (the main characters) are Americans, while the villains are Nazis, as they go head to head for the golden ark of god that invokes religious spirits, and the Nazis thought that the spirits will make the army invincible. Harrison Ford plays the main titular character; he is a heroic and collected archeologist. Marion is a tough and sassy bar tender who became Indy's partner and eventually a tormented damsel-in-distress. John Rhys-Davis is great as Indy's close friend ""Sallah"" with his amusing performance. Paul Freeman plays Rene, an ambitious jerk who is Indy's arch-nemesis, while Ronald Lacey is creepy as Major Arnold the Gestapo agent.In conclusion: With slick sophistication that offers superbly-staged set-pieces in spades throughout it's breezy pace, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is a dynamic and rip-roaring non-stop ride of an adventure yarn with rollicking fun, breathtaking audacity, and sheer brilliance. Suitable for teens thirteen and up."
jasnuevo,"Nov 11, 2021",9/10,It has been forty years since it's release and for me without doubt this is still one of the best action/adventure movies ever made.

This movie is one of those few everybody sould watch.

pal5017,"Apr 6, 2006",10/10,"This is by far and away the best movie in a trilogy of great movies. After establishing the fact that Indiana is a likable and yet not immortal hero, that the suspense never stops and that the characters still have room to be developed, there are two other things that really make this movie incredible.First, Marion Ravenwood is the best heroine of the series. If there's a possible rip against the next two, it is her absence. She is tough and aware of the events, and yet she is still beautiful and perfectly ladylike. It might seem like somewhat of a contradiction, but to anyone whos seen it, they know what I'm talking about. Elsa Scheider and Willie Scott of the later movies simply don't match up to Marion.Second, the movie is incredibly clever in that Indiana, despite all the trouble he faces, has absolutely no impact on the outcome. He could have told the government to shove it, and it would not have mattered. The Nazis eventually open the Ark, only to find that to be a somewhat gruesome thing. Its a funny irony, that the artifact they are so desperately looking for is better left untouched. Some might see this as bad, but I thought it was an interesting twist, and it does NOT ruin the movie at all. Besides, all the action and humor leading up to that point should more than make up for anyone who disliked that aspect.Either way, this movie is, IMO, the greatest of all time, a real must see!PS, I've just seen some negative reviews, and just like it was with When Harry Met Sally, most of the whiners seem to be coming from foreign countries, like France and Germany (who of course have a long history of popping out excellent movies...lol). None of them seem to have any good reason to rip the movie except that they're disappointed to see their own people getting beat up on. Oh, jealousy..."
claszdsburrogato,"Sep 26, 2023",9/10,"Steven Spielberg is easily one of the best directors in the history of cinema, and among his great projects we have the Indiana Jones franchise, one of the most notable of his career. The first film has an incredible personality, everything here is very striking and matches the tone of the film. The photography is beautiful and very light, making it relaxing to watch. The rhythm is wonderful, it never seems to get lost. The plot is very well constructed with very good characters and incredible production design. Some things here could be rough, like some fight scenes and some sound effects, but it all seems to fit very well with the entire tone of the film. This is one of the best films of Spielberg's entire career and I would say it is almost perfect, if it weren't for the dark makeup in the first hour and some other details."
JoeTeee,"Nov 22, 2021",9/10,"Out of all the Indiana Jones films, this one works the best. The give all the characters some emotional depth, which you cannot say about a lot of the other films in this franchise. I think it has good value that can still be seen in it."
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",7/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford as the iconic archaeologist Indiana Jones, is a whip-smart, globe-trotting adventure that redefined the action genre. It's bold, exciting, and packed with unforgettable sequences-but while it's certainly a cinematic landmark, it may not hit every emotional or narrative note for every viewer.Harrison Ford brings irresistible charisma to the role of Indiana Jones. He's rugged, sarcastic, brave-but not invincible. That vulnerability is part of what makes him such a compelling action hero. Ford balances charm and weariness with precision, crafting a character who feels both legendary and human. He's not just running from boulders and dodging darts-he's navigating fear, doubt, and moral dilemmas along the way.The supporting cast adds richness to the adventure. Karen Allen as Marion Ravenwood is a fiery and spirited counterpart to Indy. She's more than a damsel in distress-she's resourceful, sharp, and holds her own in the chaotic world of relic-hunting. The villains, while memorable and in classic pulp style, do lack some complexity, playing more as obstacles than deeply written characters.Visually, Raiders is a masterclass in classic adventure filmmaking. Spielberg's direction is both energetic and economical. Every action scene is clearly staged, thrilling, and often laced with humor. The cinematography by Douglas Slocombe brings exotic locales to vivid life, from shadowy tombs to sunlit deserts, crafting a world that feels both mythic and grounded. The practical effects, stunts, and set design still hold up impressively, even if a few moments might feel dated in terms of pacing or polish.John Williams' score, especially the iconic ""Raiders March,"" is a triumph. It's bold, heroic, and unforgettable. The music elevates the film's energy and imbues even its quieter moments with a sense of grandeur and momentum.That said, the film does occasionally feel like it's more focused on momentum than meaning. The plot, while engaging, is largely an excuse to string together a series of exhilarating set-pieces. For some viewers, this can make the story feel a bit superficial-more a rollercoaster ride than a deeply resonant narrative. The characters, aside from Indy and Marion, are thinly sketched, and emotional arcs take a backseat to spectacle.There's also a dated quality in some of the portrayals, particularly in how certain cultures are exoticized or reduced to backdrop. While it's true to the 1930s serials that inspired it, modern audiences might find some elements a bit tone-deaf or overly simplified.Despite these drawbacks, Raiders of the Lost Ark remains a thrilling and iconic film. It helped shape modern action-adventure storytelling and delivered a hero whose hat, whip, and smirk became instantly recognizable around the world. It's a movie that understands the joy of cinematic escapism, even if it doesn't always delve deeper.In conclusion, Raiders of the Lost Ark is a fun, fast-paced treasure hunt that showcases Spielberg at his most entertaining and Harrison Ford at his most magnetic. While it may not have the emotional depth of other films in your top tier, its technical brilliance and sheer sense of adventure make it a worthy and enjoyable classic."

The stories are vastly different, but the conflict is the same; good versus the ultimate evil, Nazis - who are the obvious inspiration to stormtroopers and the Empire. They have a very similar score, composed by the GOAT John Williams. And of course, Harrison. Freaking. Ford.Han Solo and Indiana Jones are similar characters, both being men who can't help but ooze sarcastic charisma in every scene. Indy is different in the way that he is the main feature in this franchise, and he plays a more prototypical hero type. What makes Indiana Jones such a great character is he is the perfect blend of a superhero and an ordinary man. He has the capability to pull off some incredible, superhuman-like, stunts, especially in the more recent ones, while lucking out of almost every fight he gets in.This was Spielberg's chance to direct a Star Wars film, and he knocked it out of the park! Also, shout out to Spielberg for creating the traveling map edit, a staple in the Indiana Jones franchise. This was one of my favorite films to watch as a kid, and not much has changed. My God, do I love this movie!"
AngelHonesty,"Sep 29, 2021",7/10,"Indiana might be one of the greats, and I don't disagree he is iconic, but the films are very long and mostly just action filled. Raiders of the lost ark has great cinematography and Harrison Ford met his mark by acting like a arrigent know-it-all to complete the attitude of Indiana. But with how the film drags out and the action scenes never seem to end it falls short of a 10/10."
oliviafarag,"May 6, 2019",5/10,"My ex insisted on making me watch this before I went to Cairo because he wanted me to 'relate' to it. Firstly, I'm a girl and I don't think Harrison Ford's antics or his looks or anything else are much to be excited about. The storyline is adventurous but very cliched in a cartoony kind of way and not my cup of tea. Wasn't charmed by the scenes and depiction of Cairo locals."
CollinG-1031,"Apr 30, 2024",9/10,"Perhaps the greatest action movie of all time, Spielberg creates a rollercoaster of a movie that never stops and will have you on the edge of your seat to the very end. An iconic movie with iconic characters that still holds up today. This film (like many films made in this era) has heart and substance and it's easy to tell it was made with passion for film unlike most movies, especially action, that are made today. The action and stunts look real because they are real and they are fantastic. The music (like most music by John Williams) is on another level. The many music themes that play throughout the movie are just so well done and perfectly capture each character, artifact, moment, etc. The movie has the best villain in the whole series in Belloq, an ignorant rival archeologist who manages to get artifacts by stealing them from people who did the hard work and he is easily the most compelling and best match for Indy in the series. The movie also has one of the most powerful endings ever. It gives me the chills. Growing up on the Indiana Jones films, I have so much nostalgia for them and I always have a blast watching them especially Raiders. Sure, the plot might be pretty straightforward and the characters not have a lot of depth to them and sure, Toht's melting head might not hold up as well as it used to, but in a film like this, you aren't paying attention to that. It's entertaining, well made cinema and just plain fun without being dumb, something movies today just can't seem to capture. So watch this fantastic classic and go on the adventure of a lifetime!"

gregconroy,"Jun 7, 2022",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark, is simple one of the best movies of all time. The direction, writing, cinematography, score, acting, everything hits at the highest level, people will say Spielberg's best is Jaws or Jurassic Park or Schindlers List but Raiders is for me his best."
Jithindurden,"Jun 9, 2023",8/10,"The first Indiana Jones movie I saw was The Last Crusade which gave me wrong expectations for this movie which in turn made my first watch not as good as it could've been. This time I enjoyed it for what it is and it is a hell of an adventure movie. One of the first of its kind that perfected what is there to perfect compared to different forms of it that came before. It's entertaining and action-packed with charming actors and great music. It's curious that Indian Jones is seen as a classic hero now when it was supposed to be an anti-hero they were writing, which is actually pretty evident in this movie as well as Temple of Doom as far as I can remember. We love the character because he is an antihero and not an actual hero. The man is straight up robbing indigenous cultures so he can have his kicks and make the archaeology department of his country great with not much actual regard for the culture he steals from. And even in a lot of other instances, it is shown how he rarely chooses the heroic path.The character's looks and a lot of scenes and turning points in the plot clearly show how inspired this is by The Secret of the Incas.With Close Encounters of the Third Kind and this, Spielberg really fuelled the conspiracy theorists in America, it seems. Even though the films themselves need not be said to be at fault, a lot of conspiracy theories can be boiled down to the narratives of these two movies. I can also see now how Spielberg is considered a conservative film director, where people see his movies aligning with conservative values, even if it doesn't necessarily preach any extreme values."
entertainmentish,"Jul 19, 2020",9/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is the first Indiana Jones adventure that we get a taste of and can't get enough of for years to come. Winning 4 oscars out of the 9 nominations it had, just tells you what a great movie this truly is. Packed with action, adventure, comedy , with a little of bit of romance on the side, it ticks off all the good things you would love to see in a movie and that includes a great leading man, no other than Harrison Ford.
Absolutely loved the opening scene. Spiders creeping, big rocks rolling after you, booby traps and seeing a beautiful sunset.
I love the idea of a teacher who actually does, because they always say those who can't do, teach but it doesn't apply here on Indie. He is the hot, handsome professor archeologist with a whip and the coolest hat ever.
There was a chase scene that I thought took too long, it got boring. The Nepal Scene was very intense and may make give you the shivers with an incident you don't want happening to you. The Funniest scene has to be the sword and the gun.
John Ryhs Davies was amazing as always with that great accent of his. Karen Allen is my least favorite in the movie, but I can see that she does give a lot of character around Indiana jones.
Steven Spielberg for me is one of the best directors of all time, you can always tell if it's a Spielberg movie, his direction is outstanding, eye catching and in a class of its own. The elements of adventure and comedy are always strong and it's evident here in The Raiders of the Lost Ark. Indian Jones is an iconic movies from the eighties is a must watch. It's a great piece of film that you shouldn't miss. Indiana Jones is like James bond in away. In the words of Steven Spielberg, it's a James Bond Film without the hardware!"
vortex-4,"Oct 3, 1998",N/A,"""Raiders"" is the best on-screen thrill ride every made. It hits the ground running and never stops with some of the best and most memorable action sequences ever filmed. Just buckle in for the ride as you watch Harrison Ford defy death and battle the evil Nazis as the legendary Indiana Jones trying to save the Ark                           of the Covenant from their clutches. A perfect blend of adventure, humor and pure excitement that will have you leaving the theater with an adrenalin high. The very last sequence of this movie is quietly staggering, bordering on the sublime."
OniFR,"Feb 23, 2025",9/10,"If you grew up without watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, you were probably raised in a cave by Tibetan monks. Because this film is the gold standard of action-adventure cinema: a charismatic hero, Nazis getting wrecked, truck chases, and a whip as a signature weapon. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, the coolest archaeologist in film history-a mix of James Bond, MacGyver, and a cowboy who swapped his Colt for a fedora.The story? Simple but effective. The Nazis want to get their hands on the Ark of the Covenant, the mystical chest said to contain the stone tablets of Moses. Since Hitler already has a sidekick with a mustache, he now wants a divine artifact to complete his collection. Bad luck for him-Indiana Jones isn't about to let the Third Reich score supernatural powers, so he shows up to ruin their plans... and to deliver a few well-placed punches to some overconfident Aryans.Let's be honest: some things make zero sense. Hundreds of snakes in a hidden Egyptian temple surviving without a nearby McDonald's? Try explaining that to a biologist. The villains switching from an airplane to a boat for no logical reason? That's logistics at French railway company levels. But at the end of the day-who cares? The pacing is so tight, the scenes so legendary, that these details are like typos in a text from your girlfriend-you notice them, but you let it slide to keep the vibe going.This movie is a back-to-back highlight reel of iconic scenes. The giant boulder chase rolling down like an unexpected tax audit, the street fight in Cairo where Indy just pulls out his gun instead of wasting time, the truck chase that inspired generations of filmmakers-Spielberg was at his peak, delivering fast-paced, razor-sharp action. And that score! John Williams' music makes you want to grab a whip and hat, even if it's just to go buy bread.Harrison Ford embodies the ultimate badass hero: tough, witty, never too perfect, always balancing luck and intelligence. He fights, flirts, and survives ridiculous situations with the kind of effortless cool that would make Clint Eastwood blush. His Indiana Jones is the definition of old-school charisma, a character so well-built that he annihilates every watered-down action hero Hollywood has tried to sell us for the past 40 years.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a reminder that action-adventure movies were just better back in the day. No CGI overdose, no sanitized heroes, no scripts trying to preach to the audience. Just pure adventure, suspense, well-placed humor, and a hero who radiates intelligence and testosterone. Spielberg and Lucas delivered a masterpiece, a masterclass that hasn't aged a day.Wanna see how a real adventure movie is done? Watch this legendary film-and take notes."
Shilo_R_A,"Mar 5, 2022",7/10,"Elaborate a bit more on that.Raiders of the Lost Ark follows, as written above, Indiana Jones - the smart, badass and fearless (as long as snakes are not around) archeologist and adventurer, who often goes after buried archeological treasure in order to bring them to the museum he works with. Here the US government contacts him with a special task - finding the lost ark of the covenant, which is pursued by Hitler's soldiers as well (the film takes place in 1936). So, as you can probably imagine, finding the ark before the nazis is not an easy task.I guess that others could dive into George Lucas' deep character building or something (which I don't think is exactly the case), or Spielberg's stunning cinematography (which, again, I don't really find all that mind-blowing here), but I'm gonna be honest with you.Raiders of the Lost Ark is just a simple, creative and fun film to watch.The character building isn't bad, I just think that every character is quite simple and straight forward. Except for, maybe, Jones' relationship with religion, no character here has some psychological mystery that makes you think a little bit. And even that one isn't really developed here. Marion , btw, totally feels like she was written by a man. Not to say that men can't write amazing female characters, but rather to say that you can feel how she's written from a very specific point of view on women. Quite cliche, but not terrible. She's okay, I guess.The cinematography is, again, totally fine, and I have no problem with it whatsoever. It's decent.The real strength of the film is its creativity and the consistent sense of urgency. I don't think that there are many dull moments here, if any. Almost every scene something creative, exciting and awesome is happening. I think that it can spark the childish ""oh no, he's not gonna make it!"" in every viewer, even if deep inside we all know that he's gonna be fine, since he's the protagonist. The plot thrusts the viewer from one exciting, iconic moment to another, and it's quite a fun experience.The score is great too, btw. John Williams is a legendary composer, and the main theme to this movie is one of the most iconic themes of all time. For a good reason, I'd say.So, in conclusion: Raiders of the Lost Ark is not your deep, visually amazing masterpiece, but rather a very fun watching experience with many exciting, iconic moments. The characters are simple but they work well with the plot, and I guess that this is what matters most here. Again, a lot of fun. I'm feeling a 7.9/10 on this one."
Raleon,"Aug 20, 2003",5/10,"I tried to watch Raiders of the Lost Ark when i was young, but I was so bored within the first fifteen minutes I shut off the TV and did something worth while. I watched it again now to see what I missed. I didn't miss much.    The acting is bad- horrendously bad. The actors annoyed the hell out of me. That and the action was so ludicrous I had to wonder if all the fanatics of the series ever watched an adventure movie in their lives. Other scenes were badly played out, such as when the professors were discussion the ark, and the really lame bid with the student who had I love you written on her eye lids.     I kind of respect the series for combining an influencial hero and an adventerous plotline. You can see the influence in many more movies, stories, games, etc. But besides that, it's not really very entertaining. I just don't see what all the fans see."
vithiet,"Jun 15, 2020",8/10,"I absolutely loved Indiana Jones as a kid. I hadn't watch it in years and if you've asked me to rate it yesterday (before my recent viewing), I would have said 10/10 without hesitation. However, while many elements that make it a classic stand the test of time, many others don't. Parts of the plot don't hold up, acting is very uneven and some action scenes drag on unnecessarily and there's little to no character development. All in all it's a fun one-dimensional piece of cinematographic entertainment history that's worth the watch for the sake of nostalgia or for newer generations to discover."
YourFamilyExpert,"Jan 16, 2017",10/10,"What can one say about Raiders that hasn't been said? This is, in my opinion, one of the five best action movies ever made (the others? Die Hard, Terminator 2, The Matrix, and the entire Lord of the Rings trilogy). This movie has it all: a smart story (Hitler actually was looking for the Ark in the 1930's), rich characters, memorable villains, scares, amazing sets, iconic music, solid comedy, a likable and unsentimental romance, fascinating mythology, and some of the greatest stunt/action sequences ever filmed (the opening and the truck chase stand out in particular).Raiders also benefits from the best leading lady in the series. As Marion Ravenwood, Karen Allen displays a tomboyish charm, spunk, and an unwillingness to simply be a damsel-in-distress. Case in point: when locked in the cockpit of a grounded bomber, she calls for Indiana's help for a few seconds, then decides to kill some time and some Nazis by manning the machine gun! The scene where she kisses Indy's wounds, which in another movie would be sexualized, is here very tender. Marion is resourceful, smart, and tough, making her the only love interest in the series who is Indy's perfect match.As Indiana Jones, Harrison Ford completely inhabits the character, creating a man who is both an academic and an adventurer. He's a bit of a scoundrel but also cares about people. Most importantly, he was an action hero who was self-deprecating and imperfect. Up until that point the James Bonds, the John Waynes, and the Clint Eastwoods were all extremely macho ""men's men,"" more prone to giving beatings than taking them. Even though Indiana Jones is tough and intelligent, he's constantly being outsmarted and out-punched. You know he'll win in the end, but usually he'll have to dig deep and use all of his ingenuity, physicality, and luck to to pull it out at the last second. Though John McClane and other heroes have followed the same template, Dr. Jones is the original and the best. * * * * * (out of five)"
hey-bill87,"Feb 20, 2021",8/10,"I don't like to watch most films because of the content, but this was good wholesome clean fun.Harrison Ford delivers a fantastic performance as the archaeologist turned adventurer, I'd suggest his performance is the benchmark against which any other adventure film is measured against.Directed by Steven Spielberg this is one of those movies which made him a cinematic master. With writing credits to George Lucas, off the back of Star Wars, and a John Williams musical score you are surely going to be entertained.This is a movie I can watch and re-watch, it never fails to entertain me. The musical score pushes a fantastic pace for the movie and delivers some iconic tunes too - I can still hum the theme tunes without any problems remembering how it went. It's a no holds barred adventure with fun, humour, romance, thrills, spills, horror and suspense.This is slightly darker than other Indiana Jones films but in fairness it was the start of a dynasty so audiences were only just learning about him, character development in later films would make him more family friendly but this film was rightly a PG at the time as there is the occasional tense horrifying moment and occasional bloodshed. By today's standards that is nothing though, and you can still safely watch this with young children without fear."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jan 26, 2013",10/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark is directed by Steven Spielberg and collectively written by Lawrence Kasdan (screenplay), George Lucas (story) and Philip Kaufman (story). It stars Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, Paul Freeman, Ronald Lacey, John Rhys-Davies and Denholm Elliott. Music is scored by John Williams and cinematography by Douglas Slocombe.What can you say about Raiders of the Lost Ark that hasn't been said before? It has been analysed, deconstructed, praised and written about at length by everyone from the highest of film critics to the man of the street film lover and his dog. Truth is, is that nothing new can be added to the millions of tomes written about what Spielberg coyly announced was his B movie homage to adventure serials of the 30s and 40s.In simple factoid terms it was roughly made for $20 million and went on to make nearly $400 million! It quickly pulled Spielberg out of a depressive rut after the critical mauling of his period comedy movie 1941. It announced Harrison Ford as a superstar actor whilst simultaneously introducing pop culture references that still thrive today. It won four Oscars and was nominated for a further four, and as it made archaeology sexy it heralded the opening of a new era for the summer blockbuster. The whole production (apart from Spielberg) were taken ill whilst filming in Tunisia and it was the start of a franchise that still brings great GREAT pleasures to millions of fans.Why is Raiders so adored? That it is a film that still entertains royally today, where once loved in 1981 is still loved by the very same older and wiser people in the new millennium? The answer is it gets everything right, it transcends its basic source to reveal one of the most exhilarating action/adventure movies ever made. It's packed with outstanding action set-pieces (amazing stunt-work), the special effects stunning, the locations are sumptuous, the cinematography gorgeous and Williams' score stirs the blood and raises the gooseflesh. The narrative is smooth and appealing in its good versus bad race against time simplicity, yet the pace is frenetic. From the establishment of the kinetic pleasures with its iconic opening section, to the gloriously gruesome finale, it's breakneck stuff that is by turns intense but played with considerable wit and playfulness.Casting is also spot on, with Ford leading the way. Ford's performance as Indiana Jones - part time teacher, part time lovable rogue who lurches from one perilous situation to another - is note perfect. It's a performance of style and substance that is often wrongly ignored by the stuffy, purely because of the genre of film it sits in. That Ford oozes comic book heroics without falling into campy cliché is a great achievement, while of course he gave us iconography unbound that still exists today. The supporting performances are also outstanding, with Allen's spunky hard drinking Marion and Freeman's weasel Nazi stooge Belloq particularly hitting the heights. While on the other side of the camera and at the writing table, the trio of Spielberg, Kasdan and Lucas prove to be a meeting of classical adventure loving heart and minds, for the film is crafted with humour, energy and skill.It undoubtedly owes a debt to olde Hollywood fare like Gunga Din, Secret of The Incas and Valley of the Kings (and more), while some stereotyping of natives exists because the film harks back to olde Hollywood adventure movies! And undeniably it's a teeny–tiny bit annoying that as we enter the home straight Allen's character arc has her shift from tough dame to ""save me Indy"" fodder, but small complaints be damned. This is top line genre film making, where true love is proved to always last a lifetime, because, quite simply, Raiders of the Lost Ark is still the modern day template for action/adventure movies. 10/10"

bkoganbing,"Jun 12, 2008",9/10,"Raiders of the Lost Ark marked the debut of Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones, two fisted archaeologist with a mean bull whip. The film also reawakened a longing in the American public for some good old fashioned pulp fiction adventure even if it is done tongue slightly in cheek.Archeology certainly is a competitive business, but I think Indiana Jones takes it to an exponential level. He certainly has to when he's dealing with the up and coming German Reich.What they and Jones are after is high stakes indeed. Both have a lead on where the Ark of the Covenant might be buried. It was spirited away after the destruction of the second temple in Jerusalem, whereabouts unknown until the 1930s.As the Good Book tells us the Kingdom of Israel was undefeated as long as the Ark was ahead of them in battle. So even with the Nazis rather well known policy about Jews, they'd like to have this thing with whatever powers it has.It's a pretty delicate matter. If you remember a soldier of King David was struck down for just touching the Ark as it was about to fall. You can catch that in the Gregory Peck-Susan Hayward film, David and Bathsheba. It should definitely come with a warning label.Anyway, Ford ably assisted by Karen Allen, Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies goes after it and has to battle the Nazis for possession. As for the Nazis, it's like that old adage of being careful what you wish for.Raiders of the Lost Ark was nominated for several Oscars and came away with a few in the 1982 ceremony for 1981's films. After almost thirty years it's still rollicking good entertainment.As for Karen Allen and Harrison Ford. Go see Indiana Jones chasing down that Crystal Skull in theaters now if you want to find out what happened with these two."
niaz_islam,"Aug 9, 2017",4/10,"I watched this famous film expecting it will so much more but I was disappointed instead.The story is beyond absurd, the plot is weak and there was hardly any logic present. Indiana Jones was doing a lot of things in the film: explaining, exploring, running, fighting but what he was not doing is thinking. Often there was no rational explanations for his actions which made the film uninteresting. Every time he is in trouble, he gets out of it is the most absurd and unrealistic way possible.The performance of the actors and actresses was mediocre. As the story was not that good there was nothing much to be done by them either. On top of that the action scenes were not well crafted, in fact they were pretty clumsy. Also the editing of those scenes was less than good.If you are expecting an amazing movie then I will not recommend it but if you are seeking an average type action film to watch then you can watch this."

When I saw it as a child I fell in love with it. Little bit of classic belief ( X marks the spot). the times when it scary in terms of the skeletons did do their job but thought they weren't enough to give people nightmares (personal opinion, could be incredibly wrong) just a piece of advice if your scared of snakes this might be a film that you might think about avoiding.One of Harrison Ford's best performances easily on par with his Han Solo performance."
jam47,"Jul 3, 2023",9/10,"This movie still holds up decades after its release. Lucas and Spielberg are two heavyweights and they may have created an almost perfect action film with Raiders of the Lost Ark. The film has a charismatic lead, an interwoven love story, humor, exotic settings, and of course action and adventure. A few of the special effects do look really bad, like Alfred Molina's character's corpse. But overall for an early 1980s film, they are fine, and the stunts are solid. There is something intriguing about Indy pursuing mythical artifacts that have the power to change the course of history if taken into the wrong hands."
StrictlyConfidential,"Oct 19, 2020",6/10,"For the most part I quite enjoyed watching ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" (from 1981) which was a Steven Spielberg production.Filmed on a substantial-sized budget of $18 million - This action/adventure story (set in 1936) was produced in the era prior to CGI visuals which I think makes it that much more interesting to watch.What also appealed to me about ""Raiders"" was that its hero, Indiana Jones was quite a likable guy who didn't have to use any superhero powers in order to get himself (and others) out of trouble."

RhapsodyReviews,"Nov 3, 2019",10/10,"Review:
'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is an action-adventure film directed by Steven Spielberg.
When Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) - the tweed-suited professor who just happens to be a celebrated archaeologist - is hired by the government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant, he finds himself up against the entire Nazi regime.
It's hard to write a review about a movie that, that has such a massive fanbase and does basically everything right. Raiders of the Lost Ark is one of the best adventure movies I've seen. Few films have captivated me like this one did. Part of the reason it resonates so much with me is because its history and nostalgia. It's a film from the 80's about an adventure in the 30's that uncovers ancient artifacts. It's a fantastic trip through time.
The performances are just awesome all around, and Indiana Jones is surprisingly the most compelling too. You really don't get that in movies today, where the main character is the favorite. He's an archeologist, who are supposed to be dull, cautious and dweeby, but Indiana is explosive, charming and full of life. He's a grave robber that's well educated and goes on these adventures for the museum rather than the money. He's smart and passionate about what he's interested in.
It looks remarkably vintage and sharp with its characters and pristine period costumes, but it's also wild and rugged with its dusty adventures and stunning locales. The escape from the jungle tomb, the bar fight in the mountains of Nepal and the unearthing of the Ark in the desert are all iconic scenes that are thrilling and dripping with spectacle. It feels like a tomb raiding movie should, full of adventure and relentless energy in the pursuit of the Ark. By the end of the movie, you will be exhausted from the whole experience.
Overall, this movie strikes on all aspects you would want in an adventure movie. The main character feels real and is compelling, the story is very strong and exciting, and the ending leaves you wanting more.
5/5"
zeki-4,"Jul 2, 2023",9/10,"A warning to those who really enjoy John Wick/Marvel/the Fast-movies, or almost any other modern action blockbuster: 'Raiders of the Lost Ark' is made back when they relied on practical effects and stunts. And where story mattered. Like other action movie classics (Die Hard, Terminator 2 etc) the action supports the story, not vice versa. So this 1981 movie doesn't have wall-to-wall action. It's not mostly shot in front of a green screen, the characters do not defy gravity and there is no multiverse to be had here. Just real people doing real things in real locations.If this sounds boring to you, please move on. But if you choose to spend two hours of your time following Indiana Jones on a quest against the nazis involving traps, tombs and various chases, you have chosen wisely."

martinkosecky,"Aug 5, 2020",10/10,"One of Spielberg's best movies imo. The story is decently written, Harrison Ford rocks and it all just goes well together."
CherryBlossomBoy,"Apr 9, 2017",6/10,"The film that captured the imagination of entire generations aged rather well and is still a decent watch but some parts have rotten away like bad cheese. What still stands are the lush, romanticized depiction of the pre-WWII period, the camera-work and the music. And Karen Allen's brazen quirkiness.More obvious now than before is that Tom Selleck's stand-in, Harrison Ford, proved an unsuitable lead. He brings in a rather difficult chemistry for the film that is supposed to be a goofball, roller-coaster adventure. Ford is clunky, suffering and reluctant, bordering on depression. There is a conspicuous lack of joy about his Indiana Jones that shouldn't be there, because it's at odds with everything else in the film. His comebacks at other characters come off as angry snaps rather than comic relieves. He doesn't possess that devil-may-care attitude that would convince the viewer that his character actually likes all these adventures, nor does he exude that suave, Bondian eroticism that should sell that scene where all of his female students want to eat the good professor alive. The audience must have given him a pass simply because everybody still saw a Han Solo in him.The lack of a lead that is neither too serious to expose the silly nor too hammingly humorous to drag everything into a camp is what the whole film suffers for. It's because the plot itself treads the fine line between awesome and idiotic. It mixes top-class religious artifacts and magical powers with Nazis and harebrained schemes of world domination, cartoon action with sadistic villains and their gruesome deaths, some really terrible lines of dialog with some really good one-liners, and a bungling detective story with a truly awe-inspiring and larger-than- life finale. Without the poster face that could make you forget that this mishmash of ideas, that only George Lucas could churn out, doesn't quite hold water it's easier to be taken out of the film by some of its lowest points.What keeps it together still is the brilliant direction of Steven Spielberg. His visual style was at that fledgling time of his career pretty flamboyant, with daring but perfunctory choice of angles, camera movements and compositions, which lent itself to great pacing - moving quickly through the plot points and keeping the tension in the set-pieces with the idea that no one notices how ridiculous they are. He builds up very well towards the climactic end and the revelation of the real hero of the film: the mythical Ark. Its matter-of-fact act of self-defense is a big pay-off so few films achieve these days. It's doubtful that a conventional director, however competent, would have been able to deliver anything better than a B-schlock with the given material.Harrison Ford made a career playing gloomy characters that got stuck in unpleasant situations and just wanted to leave. He should have been nowhere near this film. Steven Spielberg is a genius for making this work at all, let alone gain a cult-status, of all things."
winner55,"Nov 13, 2007",7/10,"This is one of the films that led me, slowly but surely, to loathe the work of George Lucas.To be sure, it is not a bad film - in fact, it succeeds in generating the same kind of excitement as the B-movie/serial action films of the 1930s, the formula for which it is intended to resurrect. But it is that resurrection itself that annoys me, for two reasons.First, Although the serials of the '30s were certainly a bit of daffy fun, they were just badly made. In order to enjoy them, one has to 'dumb down' quite a bit. In the early '70s revival of these films on the college circuit, this meant taking drugs before or during viewing. Without inebriates, it means adopting a child's perspective - and there is nothing wrong with that. The problem is, why insist on an expensive Hollywood production that requires the same 'dumbing down'? And do so in a manner so as to close off other, more mature approaches to the adventure film format? Secondly, the cultural references of the 1930s action B-movie were all outside of film itself - references to the political crises in Europe, to fears generated in the wake of the depression, to ennobling efforts to maintain American values against threats from within and without, to the rise of organized crime, to a developing technology no one fully understood at the time, and to increasing awareness of the strangeness of non-European cultures. A heady mix, and it's clear why Americans found the B-movie useful in sorting out and coping with so many different issues.But the cultural references in ""Raiders"" are all to movies of the 1930s. In other words, there is NO world beyond the movie screen for Mr. Lucas. Even the myth of the 'Ark of the Covenant' has more to do with DeMille's ""Ten Commandments"" than it does with the Ark as described in the Bible, since it is clearly intended to work magic, which is about as much of religion as DeMille really understood. And let's not even discuss the hopelessly card-board Nazis here.This 'dumbed down' inversion of cultural reference makes ""Raiders"" feel claustrophobic and regressive more than any other film mining the same ore I can think of. To be sure, Spielberg gives the film a professional gloss and a sense of action Lucas' other films lack. And both Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are truly delightful to watch.So the film is certainly fun to watch - but it doesn't inspire any greater respect for writer-producer Lucas, one of the true con-men of modern cinema."

AlanGamino1997,"Oct 15, 2019",10/10,"I've watched it a bunch of times on Paramount Network/Spike TV or on Syfy Channel back then, it doesn't really bothers me because of the whole movie with spoilers when the beginning, middle, or the end of the movie scenes.Indiana Jones movies is one of my favorites of all-time."
alexpeychev,"Jan 25, 2021",10/10,"I think a part of that is down to the fact it's a complete retake on the old serial movies combined with obvious comic book style, and that is just perfect for kids and appeals to them no end, or rather it did then! So it was with excitement that I opened my presents on my birthday and found the boxset for the Indiana Jones Trilogy, and with even more excitement when I finally watched the first in the trilogy, Raiders of the lost Ark.It was just as I remembered, fun, excitement, wise cracks, a tiny splattering of romance but with a manliness that kids would allow, and lots of stunts and action. It's a superb movie and captures that style of serials, adventure stories and comic books perfectly, how I know that for sure is only through repeats since I wasn't alive during those times.The set pieces are fantastic, and although some of the wilder end sequences are slightly dated now, it hasn't lost the excitement factor. It's a perfectly crafted movie as well, moving from location to location without any distraction or superfluous scenes, it just feels like it's all there for a reason and that it belongs there.Harrison Ford is excellent in the role, and I'm inclined to think he was more Indy than he was Solo, but that's a personal opinion. He has many more facial movements and voice inclinations in this early movie than he does nowadays, now he belongs to the moody, quiet school of acting, then he was dynamic, adventurous, strong and as wisecracking as the best of them.There are some excellent movie making moments in this with George Lucas and Steven Spielberg showing talent galore just oozing out of every pore (where did all that go for Star Wars I to III Mr Lucas?), and they end up making an excellently entertaining movie.Some could argue that there could be a bit more depth or seriousness to the story, but come on, it's a ripping adventure yarn, you don't need depth. Saving the Ark from the Nazi's, surely that's enough! An excellent movie and great fun too, without a doubt one of my favourite of all time."
Blueghost,"Jan 13, 2013",N/A,"The summer of 1981 was not a memorable season save for one thing; this outstanding movie. Following in the footsteps of classic serial's that used to run in movie houses, combined with the finest film making techniques utilized in epics and dramatic classics through out the era of film making, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is more than just an homage to film's of yesteryear viewed by youngsters in movie houses across America. It is the reinvention of the classic adventure.Here we see massive and delicately crafted sets and locations. We see marquis players mixed with solid character actors. We see old fashioned cinematography coupled with effects shots to bring this high adventure film to light. There's action, there's romance, there's intrigue, there's good verse evil, it's a period piece, it's got comedy, it's even got Nazis--classic bad guys from the golden age of Hollywood.The world renowned Stanford based archaeologist Doctor Henry Jones is consulted and contracted by the US Army's Office of Strategic Services to search for a relic that Hitler believes will help him conquer the world. We're there with and his friends as he grapples and races against Axis to obtain a supernatural artifact from the time just before the Roman Empire. The national socialist regime in Germany believes such a find will help win the war.This is my favorite Indiana Jones film simply because nearly everything you see in it is real, and the acting just below over the top, while at the same time being both energetic and detached to bring us a classic adventure film. There are real convincing characters mixed in with caricatures. It's a fine combination of film making styles; a classic adventure style mixed in with a near comic book style, mixed in with classic epic film making techniques. The cost was high, but the payoff was worth it. Appropriate lenses for the right shots, truly giving us the right visual feel for the film. Truly outstanding work here in terms of bringing all technical and creative story elements together. You can rarely find a match for it in the same genre.It is a bit over the top here and there, but overall, when you sum up the scenes and the entire story and visual experience, it is a masterpiece. You can see that a lot of money was put into this project, and it shows on screen; i.e. lots of tender loving care for a classic film that mimics appropriately her ""sister ships"", so to speak.Technical notes; the one thing that's bothered me about this film are the squibs for the gunfights. Particularly the full automatic fire as they were mis-timed. There's a miniature effect's sequence during the chase that's a little ho-hum. I think we the audience were still used to real cars being driven remotely off cliffs, then set ablaze or to explode while in mid flight (classic Hollywood). The backers paid extra for thousands of extras, and that's a major plus, giving the film authenticity and weight. Also, the stunts are real. Whether it's Nazi soldiers on a truck, or Harrison Ford in a pontoon aqua bi-plane, a chase through suburban Cairo or an actual U-boat as it squares off with a merchant on the high seas. Save for two or three effects' sequences, all of it is real.That, verse the last installment where the commies were the villain of the day, and nearly every shot was digitally rigged in some way. The unspoken agreement between film maker and audience member was broken by not showing a heightened reality that is ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", but a CGI experience that is ""Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"". This is the lesson for the film makers. But, that's another film for another review.The reactions from the actors are real in a story that is far fetched. The places and dressing of everything in the shot, as well as the shot itself, sells us the story and imagery we view on the screen. Marry some first class music to it, scored by the inestimable John Williams, and you have yourself one incredible film.A terrific film with high ideals and themes, set amidst a tumultuous time in European and world history.Definitely one not to miss.Enjoy!"

tom-darwin,"Apr 11, 2006",5/10,"As in ""Big Budget B"" Movie, the sort of visually spectacular, splendidly orchestrated live-action cartoon that Lucas & Spielberg pioneered separately and, on this occasion, together. In 1936 heartthrob college professor & graverobbing mercenary Indiana Jones (Ford, perhaps by way of Harold Robbins & Steve McQueen) is hired by the US Army to find & loot the original Hebrew Ark of the Covenant from its presumed hiding place in a lost Egyptian city before Hitler's SS/Gestapo/Afrika Korps/Kriegsmarine/Luftwaffe/Abwehr can get it. To do this he must first procure a critical icon from a girlfriend (Allen) that he dumped and who is now running Kathmandu's answer to Rick's Cafe Americain (there's no piano, but the wind whistles most soulfully). A two-minute reverse ""Casablanca"" interlude ends with another plot twist and plenty of enjoyable, stunning mayhem. Characters come & go in no particular order, including nebbish professor Brody (Elliott), Egyptian laborer Sallah (Rhys-Davies, who could give any Tonto or Dr. Watson a run for his money), tramp sea captain Katanga (Harris), rival mercenary Belloq (Freeman, who eventually comes across as French) and cartoonishly evil Nazis (Lacey, Kahler & Higgins, all perfectly cast). Ford holds the film together with a quintessentially American mix of determination, frustration, weariness & wonder. Allen brings a coarse feminism to the role of damsel tied to a set of railroad tracks. The film fails because its convoluted plot can never find even the tiniest ground in common sense, much less reality, with plot holes large enough for whole solar systems to nest comfortably. The largest of many large, of course, is that the hero's job is to rob other peoples of their cultural treasures and sell them for money. In a scene that desperately needed to be cut, Belloq actually points this out to Jones. Other giant leaps include Hitler's obsession with the occult (nonexistent), Germany's dominance in Egypt and the Mediterranean (never happened) and enough Biblical heresies to make Harry Potter look like the Pope. The charm of ""Lost Horizons"" (Jones flies over the same mountains at about the same time, but Shangri-La prefers Ronald Colman) and even ""King Solomon's Mines"" is replaced here by breathtaking action punctuated by Groucho-esq one-liners (""I'm making this up as I go along"") and the obligatory juvenile, Spielberg gross-out scenes (Tarantino slices off body parts, Spielberg likes snakes, bugs & sharks). Still, Lucas & Spielberg are the masters of effective excess and ""Raiders"" is best enjoyed as a series of cartoon or ""Lone Ranger"" or ""Perils of Pauline"" adventures (the opening sequence is supposedly inspired by a Disney Ducks cartoon, anyway). Williams's music is as wonderful as any he's done and perhaps the best ever in an action film. The success of the franchise assured, here are some ideas for sequels: ""Raiders of the Declaration of Independence,"" ""Indiana Jones & George Washington's False Teeth,"" and ""The Hunt for Lenin's Embalmed Remains."""
mattkerr-73017,"Jul 5, 2021",10/10,"There is a certain place and time that the perfect adventure movie could be made, and that is during the 1980s, when the nostalgia for the adventure films of the 1930s and the grandeur of the golden age of Hollywood could be balanced, around a decade before practical effects would be replaced largely by years of what is, in retrospect, a CGI hellscape that has not aged well. I understand the irony in speaking of nostalgia driving this film while ranting about my own nostalgic look back, but I don't mean it as an insult; the movie would not exist without it. And if the perfect pieces had not been set in place for what is, without a doubt, the greatest adventure movie of all time (and probably the greatest blockbuster), perhaps it would not still be watched and remembered with the fondness that it is, the nostalgia by itself claiming both the continued admiration for this movie and an ill-received third sequel decades later (and more to come).While it kicked off the Indiana Jones franchise, it should be noted that this isn't an 'Indiana Jones' movie; the lack of our protagonists namesake in the title being the main giveaway. Much like Star Wars coming out in 1977 lacking ""Episode IV"" as later additions would add, there was no guarantee that a cultural phenomenon would be born from this movie. Indiana Jones differs from the likes of Star Wars however; in many ways it has aged better. Maybe because we have not been suffocated with it in the way that we have with these other franchises. The continuity has to be tied to Dr Jones, which has saved us from 'Indiana Jones 9', and thank god for that. And there is Raiders, the film that would not be topped despite the efforts of subsequent films in its franchise, which could be an argument as to why many others are extended until the beaten horse no longer breathes - that there is hope of topping what is considered the best.I love this movie. I watched this again with my partner, and during the film she said ""I dunno, I think I prefer The Mummy"". I nearly fell off the goddamn sofa."
jbloomer-1,"May 29, 2020",10/10,"One of the best of all time. Now, if we could just get the revisionist title removed from this listing, that would be great.

eva3si0n,"Jan 24, 2021",10/10,One of the best adventure movies. Perhaps the first movie is one of the best in a series on a row with the 3rd part. Just the best role of Harrison Ford in his career. Standard of adventure cinema.
salvadorheroe,"Jul 4, 2023",10/10,"The Indiana Jones movies have been part of an immersive cult following that has sparked a new way of viewing adventure movies, led by the popular and acclaimed director Steven Spielberg alongside his bosom friend and mastermind behind the Indiana Jones character George. Lucas, managed to create an action movie that connects with the adult and youth audience.The simple fact of casting Harrison Ford as Indiana Jones was one of the best decisions, since at that time they cast one of the most admirable and respectable people of his time, with a throbbing adrenaline rush for adventure is what has made him original. And special to harrison ford as indiana jones.Raiders of the Lost Ark was, is, and will always be the adventure movie par excellence. Nothing comes close, nothing will, and nothing in his series comes close. The series as a whole is fantastic, with entries 2 and 3 being wonderful sources of entertainment. Are they Raiders?"
ylings-45181,"Jul 26, 2020",8/10,"The plot is old-fashioned, but the action is fascinating, especially the effect of IMAX Experience.

It's no different from Nazi Germany."

TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,"May 9, 2020",10/10,"This movie is beyond well casted. When you just see Harrison Ford in costume, you can already tell this definitive embodiment of the character. The suits are very retro and reminiscent of old noir movies. The sets are well constructed and bring the mythology of Egyptian culture to life. Every character in the movie, even the side or background characters, seem to have their own charisma to them, especially Harrison Ford in the leading role. This movie seems to have never ending sequences, gunfire after gunfire, and convoluted trap after convoluted trap."
owen-watts,"Jul 10, 2024",7/10,"It's really strange unearthing a franchise this old, and the dogged commitment to the style and tone of even older films makes Indy's '81 debut seem more ancient still. That being said, the relentless pace of the thing gives it this breakneck bonkers energy which feels somehow timeless. What isn't timeless is some of the content and I recognise the context for Marion and the portrayal of the Egyptian characters but you certainly wouldn't do either the same way now. Seeing this functional and fun foundational artefact again in new light made me reflect on the effectiveness of second-third and even fourth-hand nostalgia. How the old-fashioned franchise got parents taking kids, and those kids took their kids and so on. A real cinematic legacy is born with a bullwhip and a battered brown hat."

Lechuguilla,"Jul 20, 2008",N/A,"A globe-trotting American archaeologist travels to Egypt in search of the ancient Ark of the Covenant, in this adventure epic from director Steven Spielberg. It's a big-budget popcorn flick aimed mostly at kids. There's lots of heavy-duty action as our hero, Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), makes all the right moves to escape dreaded Nazis, a bed of snakes, knife-wielding Egyptians, fiery explosions, poison food, human skeletons, bullets, airplane propeller blades, and assorted other dangers. Since there's nothing subtle about the story or the characters, and since the action plot zips along at the speed of light, viewers need not engage in any thinking.With Jones as a surrogate for American virtuousness, ""foreigners"" in this film seem inept and villainous for the most part, a politically correct view for the era in which the film was made. American stereotypes aside, non-Americans are portrayed in the film mostly as clutter, film props for our hero to knock over.It's all a bit much, a bit over-the-top. Not only is the story not believable, the story's theme is rather condescending. I despised the background music, annoyingly loud and manipulative. Acting is largely irrelevant, not surprising, given the film's genre.In its defense, there are some good visual images. For example, I liked the scene of Jones, wearing his trademark hat, in silhouette, on a hill, back-lit by an orange sun. The film's color cinematography probably is its best element.Otherwise, ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"" is just one more in a long series of ""action"" movies for kids to drool over, a two hour cinematic ... cartoon. The script concept is silly; the characters are poorly defined; the plot is ridiculous; the score is annoying; and the American hero theme is very irritating."
caricatunssss,"Mar 25, 2019",7/10,"No, not really, but is a pretty good film, maybe one of my favorites. It has some great action, some great characters and everything in here is about the rule of cool. Indiana Jones is a perfect character who gets everything right. He is smart, strong and catches every woman he wants. This would usually not be a great idea for a character, but it works perfectly in here. The difference between Indiana Jones and any self-insertion character, is that, actually, even if i don't look for self-insertion, is a very fun character. He has personality, and even if it doesn't have flaws, at least is entertaining to watch. The film is also great generating suspense, constructing the mystery of the lost ark, and at the end, giving a very satisfying conclusion. Great story, great action, simply great. Raiders of the lost ark is one of the, if not the, most memorable films i've ever seen. Even if the characters were boring, the scenes work perfectly."

Giugi1101,"Jul 11, 2022",7/10,"First film in the saga of the man with the whip and the hat that marked a generation of adventurers. Despite its cinematic importance, the film is not that great, poor in plot and importance of the protagonist and, moreover, one feels the old age of the effects. All in all, however, it entertains even if not throughout its duration."
educallejero,"Jul 22, 2020",5/10,"Technically valuable with a great Spielberg. Really hard to film action/chase scenes, plus localizations instead of modern CGI. And all of that is nice and good, but it doesn't compensate for a really thin story, simplistic characters, and the impossibly bigger amount of really stupid ""Three Stogies"" kind of jokes that irritates me to no end. Cartooney screams appear out of nowhere to force a laugh into the 80's middle class family type. It's annoying and dumb. When they actually write the jokes, they are funny (not more than 5 the entire movie).Anyways. Boring long scenes for a thin plot that is, in the end, just an excuse for the action sequences. Terrible characters (Although Allen is great) and annoying childish crap all around. I expect better for the sequel.""Irritante. Talento puro de Spielberg Pero sencillamente no puedo. Observo la dificultad y calidad de lo logrado técnicamente en las escenas de aventura y acción, que son muchas y muy variadas. Observo el valor de grabar en distintas localizaciones en lugar del moderno actual CGI.Pero tampoco puedo dejar de observar lo inundada que está la película de chistes sacados de """"Los Tres Chiflados"""". Es casi insultante la cantidad de idioteces que suceden con tal de sacar una sonrisa a la familia tipo de los años 80. No puedo. No lo soporto. Cada vez que se oye un grito exagerado y caricaturesco cuando un villano vuela por los aires a punto de morir, me saca absolutamente de la película.La aventura en sí y su trama, es lineal, simple y aceptable. Funcional más que otra cosa. La producción y dirección, excelente. Karen Allen no sólo es hermosa sino que inyecta una energía impresionante en cada una de sus escenas. Pero Ford es opaquísimo; los personajes (aunque esperable) son muy planos y poco interesantes; la trama algo lineal; y todo está plagado de irritantes y pésimos chistes infantiles. Y no puedo evitar notarlo. Ni que me irrite."""
gab-14712,"Mar 2, 2019",10/10,"Steven Spielberg is back, better than ever! After the dismal failure that was 1941, the acclaimed director teamed up with George Lucas, coming off his Star Wars fame to create one of the most memorable heroes of all time. Raiders of the Lost Ark is my favorite movie from 1981 and is in my top 20 films of all time. This movie gives everything you could ask for. Strong, memorable characters, witty dialogue, fantastic set pieces, exotic locations, great action, and a John Williams musical theme you could never forget. Indiana Jones is my favorite fictional hero and this movie is the example why I believe that.This movie has fascinating origins. George Lucas was writing this movie the same time he came up with the idea for Star Wars. He decided to pursue his space adventure instead to great success. In 1978, while on vacation in Hawaii, he ran into Steven Spielberg, who was coming off Close Encounters of the Third Kind. Spielberg expressed his idea of creating a James Bond movie. Lucas showed him his character, which was named Indiana Smith at first, thus creating a collaboration which would lead to this movie and two sequels and a prequel. The film also takes influence from the works of Edgar Burroughs Rice, 1930's serials, and a 1950's comic about a globe-trotting duck named Scrooge McDuck.This movie really has it all. With Spielberg and Lucas at the head, screenwriter Lawrence Kasdan joined the project to help polish the script. Together they created memorable heroes in Indiana Jones, an archaeology professor who travels the world to protect or find ancient artifacts and his former girlfriend Marion who is strong female character who is able to protect herself. For villains, we have the horrible Nazis, drunken Sherpas, Frenchmen making alliances with the Nazis, and Jones's favorite animal, snakes! He hates snakes! For locations: we have the sands of Egypt, abandoned submarine bases, the jungles of Peru, the mountains of Tibet, and so forth. If you want a travelling experience from your own living room, look no further than this movie.I was impressed with the plot. The plot is simple and really is a framework for all the impressive action scenes and stunts there are. But in the end, everything is coherent and makes plenty sense. It is the year 1936. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) learns from his good friend, Brody (Denholm Elliot) that the Nazis are searching for the Ark of the Covenant, a golden casket that was used to house the Ten Commandments. It has also been known that this arc is able to give power to those who wield it. Jones's mission? To reach the Ark before the Nazis do. He goes to Tibet to pick up Marion (Karen Allen) who has a medallion that has a secret to the location of the Ark. Together, they head to that location where they will try to beat the Nazis-and scheming Frenchmen at their own game.The performances are all excellent. What is funny that when Spielberg/Lucas did the casting, Spielberg wanted Harrison Ford from the get-go, but Lucas was against his casting because he did not want Ford to be is ""Bobby De Niro"" which is in reference to Martin Scorsese always casting Robert De Niro in his films. In retrospect, I do not think anyone could have pulled this role off like Harrison Ford did. Ford was brilliant and created a memorable character with his iconic performance. He is kind and intelligent character, but he can be ruthless at times. However, he is charming. Charm may be the one word that can describe Indiana Jones. I really dug Karen Allen's performance. A strong-willed character with the ability to protect herself. I liked the villainous performances from the slimy Nazis. Paul Freeman as Dr. Rene Belloq as the scheming Frenchman who happens to be Jones's rival, and Ronald Lacey as the incredibly slimy Nazi, Toht.Even in today's cinematic world, the visual effects and the action sequences stand out. I honestly cannot say what I liked the most since everything was so well-done! The opening sequence set forth what to expect in this movie. That boulder chasing Jones is an amazing sequence. That chase scene is great as well, and it makes good use of an old, classic joke! Another sequence that stood out to me is when Jones and Marion are holding on to dear life in the pit of snakes. That was a scene that let you feel real horror. And don't get me started on the face-melting sequences! I am still in awe what the special effects team did with this film.Raiders of the Lost Ark is a true classic that spawned a franchise that is still going strong today. Adventure stories with some history mixed in are my kind of stories. I like travelling to these exotic locations through these characters. This film has a unique balance of comedy, action, stunts, and adventure. When Nazis are your villains, this is how they should be used. As slimy creatures that can get their butts handed to them by Indiana Jones.My Grade: A+"

bat-5,"Oct 22, 1998",10/10,"This film has got to be one of the best films that showcases top notch stunt work and top of the line special effects.  The script has the right bit of humor and action that keeps you moving along with the plot.  Harrison Ford is at his best here, playing the intrepid Indiana Jones.  His goal of course is to find the Ark before the Nazi's do, and we're along for the ride!  The movie seems to climax several times, from the escape from Peru to the burning bar in Nepal.  The street fight, the discovery of the Ark, the fight beneath the flying wing, the desert chase, and of course the opening of the Ark.  In between  all of this action we meet some interesting characters that become the main reason for watching this movie in the first place.  Sure the effects and stunts are neat, but if we don't care about the characters, then they're not that special anymore."
Murdy,"Jun 15, 1999",N/A,"Yes, I said it. Raiders is a better movie than Star Wars. There are no annoying robots or aliens and the acting Harrison displays in this film far exceeds his work in Stars Wars, plus the dialog is much better. It may not be the ""grand epic"" that Star Wars is, but all in all it is a superior flick.This is a remarkable movie. The opening scene is one of the most memorable in all of film. It never slows down from there, and we never have to hear Harrison Ford say ""not me sister, I'm only in it for the money""."
Abdulxoxo,"Nov 16, 2020",7/10,"This was an intense, entertaining film. The acting from the whole cast was incredible especially Harrison Ford, Karen Allen, and John Rhys-Davies. The visual effects provided intense moments that puts the audience in suspense. the action and fight sequences were spectacular but too violent for my liking. The score while memorable, it was repetitive and played during scenes that don't need it, like the car chase sequences it was just distracting. the cinematography was on another level.All in all, the movie was impressive with its great performances and big ideas. Definitely worth a watch."
tsheridan94,"Feb 7, 2010",7/10,"It's very possible. It's definitely the best Indiana Jones movie that's been made. This movie actually runs on a path similar to a heart-rate monitor, where there are sudden blips of action interspersed in periods of relative calm. This is a very effective way of running this genre of film, because the sudden action creates a certain tension. There is the possibility of something big lingering. This style has become more and more common place recently, but was revolutionary at the time. In all the years since this style became popular, maybe even revolutionized by Raiders, the Lost Arc still is one of the most effective users of this pacing. Honestly, is there anyone who doesn't think that scene in the cave or that scene with Harrison Ford under the truck among the best action sequences of all time?The other element that this movie has that so many action movies somehow forgot to include recently is a plot. This genre has recently become a joke, with the extent of the stories going only so far as to allow the maximum amount of explosions and assorted other pieces of eye candy. Raiders of the Lost Arc doesn't include as many explosions (although there are some) as many other films. There is a lot more emphasis on human stunts on feats of inhuman athleticism.As far as the obligatory love interest for Indiana, Marion Ravenwood is easily my favorite. She's very believable emotionally and almost reminds me of a non-Italian Mona Lisa Vito in My Cousin Vinny. At least in the respect that her emotions toward Indiana fluctuate between intense anger and almost swooning. But not quite, because Marion is one tough chick.And Harrison Ford much improves anything he touches (although 8I can't speak for his new Extraordinary Measures, which I have no interest in seeing. Brandon Fraser generally ruins everything he touches. But that's a tangent for another time.) Anyway, Ford is fantastic, perhaps the best action movie hero of all time. Not only is he a wonderfully flawed relateable character, he can also be brutal. I guess that just goes with the profession. Or maybe not. Indy is one glorified archaeologist. If only all archaeological digs were this exciting, I guarantee this would be one of the more common professions.Those are some of the coolest death scenes, too. All I can say is watch out for rotors, and make sure to avert your eyes. And if you want to survive, make sure you have a great theme song."
mario_c,"May 27, 2008",5/10,"Not being a great fan of Hollywood Adventure/Action movies I never cared too much about Indiana Jones trilogy. However, with the recent release of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" I thought about give it a chance. I had in my mind to watch the trilogy in a row and then go to the theater watch the new film. But after seeing this ""Indiana Jones and the Raiders of the Lost Ark"" I changed my mind! It's not really my type of movie! I think it really is a classic and a top film for the fans of the genre, but not for me! I just don't appreciate this kind of cinema. Period. So, I won't waste my time (and money) watching the other films. Even so I will score it with a ""polite"" 5/10 in order to respect one of the greatest legends of the movies' industry: Indiana Jones!"

stormhawk2021,"Jun 19, 2017",10/10,"In 1975, George Lucas and Philip Kaufman came up with the concept of a film that would pay homage to the action serials of the 1930's and 40's like ""The Adventures of Captain Marvel"" or ""Dick Tracy"" - you know, the one's were they'd always end in a cliffhanger? However, this idea was put on hold so that Lucas could concentrate on ""Star Wars"" in 1977. After the surprise success of that film, Lucas then embarked on the proposal and enlisted the help of Lawrence Kasdan on the screenplay and gave his friend Steven Spielberg the chance to direct and prove the studio bosses wrong after the star-studded, monumental failure of his World War II comedy ""1941"", a couple of years previously. This meeting of minds resulted in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" and has since became one of cinema's most revered and iconic film's. Dr. Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford) is a renowned archaeologist who is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant - a chest the Hebrews carried around containing the Ten Commandments. Indy is not the only one after the Ark, though, as he soon crosses paths with Hitler's Nazi's, also intent in getting their hands on the artifact. Classic Adventure film of the very highest caliber. In fact, it's hard to argue that this isn't the one to beat in terms of sheer indulgence and escapist entertainment. I grew up with Indiana Jones and there are very few characters or films who have had such a direct or major influence on my love for the cinematic art-form. It's difficult to find the words for Raiders that haven't already been said. Quite simply, it's a true action spectacle that's unparalleled and stands as one of Steven Spielberg's finest moments. He's a director that's, rightly, regarded as one of Hollywood finest filmmakers and you don't have to look much further than this film to see why. With one hair raising set-piece after another, Spielberg keeps the action relentless and fully realizes a romanticize pastiche of the aforementioned serials' clichÃ©d plot elements and devices. Of course, what aides immeasurably in bringing it all together, is a perfectly committed and physical performance from the leading man. Contrary to popular belief, Harrison Ford was the first choice for Indy. Well... it was in Spielberg's eyes, anyway. It was Lucas who wanted to cast someone else as he wanted to create a little distance from Ford having already worked with him on ""American Graffiti"" and ""Star Wars"" and as common knowledge would have it, Lucas preferred Tom Selleck. Unfortunately for him, though, he was already committed to the television series ""Magnum P.I."" which resulted in Ford securing, what would become, his signature role. I think it's fair to say that Ford has never exactly been praised for his acting range. Sure, he's certainly able to deliver some wonderful work; his powerful turn in ""The Mosquito Coast"" and his Oscar nominated performance in ""Witness"" are proof of this but his portrayal of Indiana Jones is absolutely spot on. He captures the requisite charm, wit and smarts to win you over. He exaggerates his facial expressions to the point of parody and completely sweeps the audience up in his heroic adventures. Even though he's the hero of the story, Ford never let's you think for a second that he's infallible or indestructible. Every scrape, punch or altercation still feels like it could be Indy's last and that's a fabulous achievement when you pretty much get the gist of the film's formula or structure. Considered one of the best films ever made and, to this day, remains one of the highest grossing. It went on to win four Academy Awards out of nine nominations and these accolades alone speak for themselves. I, for one, couldn't argue with any of them."
edwagreen,"Dec 12, 2010",10/10,"Superbly outstanding film. It has it all. A great story line, plenty of action and a historical perspective that is most interesting and possibly quite plausible.The lunatic Hitler wants the Lost Ark since he feels that with it, the German armies will be invincible.There is some irony in the film. Harrison Ford, as archeology professor, Dr. Indiana Jones is rather dull as he lectures the class. Go know that even though the first scene is action-packed, there will be plenty of action as Jones as lover played by Karen Allen, attempt to dupe and run from the Nazis all the way. I must say that the latter get exactly what they deserve at the end.Steve Spielberg filmed a non-stop action eventful film within an era of historical perspective."
johnnyboyz,"Aug 10, 2011",7/10,"Steven Spielberg has always been the sort of director whom, when provided with a 'log-line' or one sentence premise, has been able to use his ability to just grab the idea by the scruff of its neck and run with it. A bunch of people on an isolated tropical island populated by dinosaurs eventually running amok is given a radical overhaul and transformed into something more exciting and more substantial than it has any right to be; a man drives a car over a long distance across the barren states of the U.S.A., but is terrorised by a crazed truck driver becomes something quite special; a cynical parent of two young children faces the fight of his and his family's life when blood thirsty creatures invade Earth and he must guide them to some sort of safety. Raiders of the Lost Ark, along with the likes of the above in Jurassic Park and Duel among others, feeds off Spielberg in this mood and on this form; a feature that comes complete with dastardly villains trying to end the world; unadulterated heroes; feisty sidekicks; love interests; rounded, jolly foreign supporting acts of a differing ethnicity to that of the lead's as well as the Nazis as the bad guys.Following the adventures of one of the best loved protagonists in film history, Raiders begins deep in the jungles of South America sometime in the 1930s; the music ominous, a group of men trudging on to what appears to be the laughter of the wildlife as they undertake a march many have previously attempted, but never completed. One of the men, following in a pack behind that of Harrison Ford's lead Indiana Jones, draws a gun; but our man is whip-smart in a literal sense to the revelation, and manages to hear; react; work his skill with the bull-whip he possesses and then defuse the situation without ever having to use grosser means of violence. We can tell Jones knows his stuff, or does his research; he treats a temple ""no one has ever come out from alive"" as if he had been there before and done what he's about to do a dozen times. He ventures in, his accomplice the picture of fear contrasting Jones' own state, and beats the system; swiping the prize and getting back out again – in the process avoiding a boulder who's trigger system has done well to survive all these centuries of people not making it this far.There is something indescribably endearing about a man capable of the above, and yet by day, is a stuttering; glasses-wearing academic whom stammers around wielding arrays of scrolls he struggles to carry properly; in turn, knowing an awful lot about issues and subjects of an archaeological nature most would dismiss as somewhat nerdy. Jones is called upon by the American government to come into contact with a Biblical artifact known as the Ark of the Covenant, a mission laid out in no uncertain terms as being highly dangerous and mostly with the threat of the Nazi party spreading their wings into North Africa to try and find it for their own means. As a Macguffin, Spielberg does his utmost to effectively render the thing near enough to a character all by itself; a dangerous, looming character with what appears to be its own mind and priorities as these pesky early-to-mid twentieth century human-beings toy with it; transport it; fight for it but essentially wake it from its rest. An early revealing of the object in sketch form, lying there on a text book page radiating light and power, acts as an unnerving envisaging of what the thing is capable of. Jones initially rejects the proclaimed ""power"" that the Ark has, citing it as something in the region of ""occult mumbo-jumbo"", and therein that statement lies a refreshing little transition for Jones to undergo as he learns of its true power and of certain people's dedication towards it.Working with the Nazis is a French archaeologist named René Belloq (Freeman); an 'Id' to Jones' superego: a well dressed and far more formal man to Jones' grizzled demeanour and whose morals are equally spread eagle on the spectrum. Along for the ride, after an excursion in the snowy barren nothingness of Nepal, Jones enlists Marion Ravenwood (Allen), whom he shares a botched romantic history. Ravenwood is a woman capable of holding her own; the sense of the film's overly guilty disposition rife in its having her in the midst of a drinking contest when we first see her, before placing her at the forefront of a sober; competent conversation with that of another human-being minutes later. Ford and Allen bounce off one another to varying degrees of success, their romance of old constantly hovering in the background as we observe the man's shot at redeeming himself to her as a man and not a runaway – the film maintaining her hard bodied edge throughout proceedings without ever sagging to levels of objectification.There is an awful lot to enjoy in Raiders with nary a lot to necessarily get agitated about; the film is flat out adventure from the point of the Ark's uncovering, culminating in an eerie finale during which the culmination of several things explode at once in a dizzying moment of terror and thrills. The film is mostly an array of set pieces and stunts, but there is a grounded sense about the chase and adventure. We do not entrust Jones to be infallible; when he is shot, we grimace; when he takes a beating and bleeds, we observe him stumble his way back up and sense injury. In spite of its nature, the film never threatens to descend into that of anything below taut and engaging; rather, it is mostly a project filling us with a joyous feeling - lovingly constructed by a man out to do what he enjoys most, in making something exuberant that his audience can get stuck into."
Hey_Sweden,"Jan 5, 2013",10/10,"It's a testament to the entertainment value of this adventure classic that its approximate one hour and 56 minute run time just flies by. Whether one is revisiting it or experiencing it for the first time, it flows along extremely well, maintaining a high level of excitement and populating its diverting story with a rich array of memorable characters. Today it remains a career highpoint for its filmmakers and much of its cast.Concocted by Steven Spielberg and George Lucas (with official story credit going to Lucas and Philip Kaufman), and scripted by Lawrence Kasdan, it takes its inspiration from the movie serials of decades past, and goes them one better in terms of its thrills and chills. Harrison Ford stars as 1930s archaeologist / professor / adventurer ""Indiana"" Jones, to whom we're introduced in a marvellous opening set piece taking place in the Peruvian jungle. He ends up hired by the American government to locate and obtain the mystical Ark of the Covenant before Adolf Hitler and his minions can get their slimy hands on it.He's accompanied by a wonderfully feisty leading lady, Marion Ravenwood, played to perfection by the appealing Karen Allen. Among Indy's friends are museum curator Marcus Brody (Denholm Elliott) and Egyptian digger Sallah (John Rhys-Davies), and among the enjoyably devilish bad guys are charming rogue Belloq (Paul Freeman), a ruthless rival archaeologist, a cold blooded Nazi officer, Dietrich (Wolf Kahler), and an incredibly creepy interrogator, Toht (Ronald Lacey). It's also fun to see a young Alfred Molina, in his breakthrough film role, as the Peruvian guide in that opening sequence.Even if the viewer is thoroughly familiar with the film by now, there's still lots of enjoyment to be had in viewing the assorted iconic scenes: Indy pursued by a runaway boulder, the confrontation in the Nepal bar, the chases through the streets of Cairo, the fight near the Nazi plane, one of the best vehicle chases to be seen in cinema, and that final scene where the power of the Ark is unleashed. There are certainly macabre moments to be found throughout, but this merely adds to the sense of danger and the sense of fun constantly being created by Spielberg and associates. The efforts of a first rate crew - production designer Norman Reynolds, art director Leslie Dilley, cinematographer Douglas Slocombe, editor Michael Kahn, etc. - are supplemented by eye popping special effects supervised by Richard Edlund, nifty makeup effects by Chris Walas, and of course that hummable rousing theme music by John Williams that can stay in your head long after the film is over.Overall there's plenty of pizazz and humour in the presentation that continues to make this top notch escapism. This was a favourite of this viewer as a child and it's lost none of its appeal over the years.Followed by a prequel, two sequels, and the 'Young Indiana Jones' TV series.10 out of 10."
Prince-P,"Mar 22, 2023",7/10,"In Hollywood, you're only as good as your latest movie. A fact that in the early eighties was crystal clear to Steven Spielberg. His most recent picture was the World War II comedy ""1941"". A fiasco both at the box office and among critics. Suddenly, the major film companies weren't that interested in Spielberg's new projects any longer.Enter George Lucas. The director had just made ""Star Wars"", a phenomenal, worldwide success. That's why the management at Paramount listened when Lucas suggested that his pal Steven Spielberg could direct a new film he had written. A loving homage to the old B-movies that he had grown up with. George Lucas even had a title for the piece. ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"", was his suggestion.Steven Spielberg understood how important it was to get the right man to play the lead. The Indiana Jones part. He thought he'd found his guy in Tom Selleck, but unfortunately the actor couldn't get time off from his ""Magnum PI"" TV show. So, with only weeks left until production start, a relatively unproven Harrison Ford was hired.In retrospect, Tom Selleck must have been thankful that he didn't get the part. The making of ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was highly exhausting, with long takes in inhospitable locations. The desert scenes, for instance, were shot in Tunisia, where the entire film crew suffered from dysentery from the local food. Spielberg described this later as one of the worst filming experiences of his entire career.In the summer of 1981, the American film industry was in a precarious position. As a result of sharply rising production costs and declining cinema audiences' profits were down. But luckily, ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" changed all that. Steven Spielberg's cinematic juggernaut became one of the highest-grossing movies of all time. The director behind the debacle ""1941"" was on his way to super-stardom."
axlrhodes,"May 7, 2008",10/10,"Spielberg has hit some highs in his career but i feel Raiders sums up his film making talents best.Its a rollicking adventure that has been imitated but never equalled.Im sceptical as to whether The Crystal Skull will live up to the hype but one things for sure, Raiders will endure for years to come as a classic of modern American cinema.A work colleague of mine recently put it to me that he felt it was a dated, badly edited film,my jaw dropped,was he looking at the same film as me?Such is my love for Raiders,i had to reconsider our friendship for a brief moment before agreeing to disagree.Raiders just leaps off the screen, Harrison Ford is a legend and delivers a great film performance as Indy.An all time great. 10/10 only because i cant give it 11."
searchanddestroy-1,"Apr 1, 2021",10/10,"It is said that Steven Spielberg was heavily influenced by the serials of the golden era, the thirties and forties, produced for the best of them, by Republic Pictures studios and directed by the likes of Bill Witney and John English or Spencer Gordon Bennett, with the great Yakima Kanutt as the master stunt scenes, more outstanding one than the other. And when I watch this film, the best of Spielberg - concerning the.""leisure"" part of Spielberg's filmography - and among the best features in the movie history, I can't prevent myself to admit that it is a serial from the eighties. Even nearly forty years after discovering it, I am still amazed, which is not the case for many movies from the eighties, films that I discovered in my early adult life and that don't belong to my childhood - another life for me, as many people. When you are a child, movies are not seen the same way as when you find them when you are an adult. So back to this one, everything has already been said, I just wanted to point out the serial tribute. And I discovered forties serial from Republic pictures when I was thirty years old, already a adult."
adamjohns-42575,"Jan 17, 2021",10/10,"Well, we all know that this is the greatest of the four so far. What an excellent story and an introduction to archeology that my generation will never forget. Tomb Raider will have had the same effect on the next generation, while Time Team simply passed us all by.There's no way I can review this film without calling it epic. Not in the traditional overly long film about Jesus or a Great War sense, but in the fact that it just gives so much to the audience.I must have seen it twenty times at least, it's generally a tradition to watch them all starting on Boxing Day. I'm a bit late this year, but I still forget elements about this one, because there is just so much squeezed in, without compromising on the story or the characters.Indy is brilliant, the typical hero. Mild mannered and a bit of a clueless teacher during term time whilst a whip cracking archeological genius on his days off. Harrison is superb in this role, we know from 'Star Wars' (1977) that he plays the scoundrel well and his roguish charm isn't lost here either.Marion is certainly the least annoying of his female companions. She is loyal despite their history and there's far less screaming than the blonde in the next one!Marcus Brody is played so very well by Denholm Elliot and I love it later on when we get to see more of his character in the third instalment.Jonathan Rhys-Davies is great as Sallah too. He has a real presence on film and once again his role gets further explored in 'The Last Crusade' (1989).The other members of the cast all do a great job as well. I think it's brilliant that Pat Roach gets to appear in all of the first three films and although only a small part in each, he gives his best every time.The story is excellent, a real journey across the map to chase treasure by plane, car and boat. Which child of the 80's wouldn't find it exciting to watch this film? I know other generations that enjoy it too - older and younger.The action is new and fresh and you really route for Jones as he suffers the odd setback here and there, but wins out in the end.I still can't find the C-3PO and R2-D2 references in the hieroglyphs, I think you'd have to watch it frame by frame to find them and I just don't have that time to spare.It's quality is obvious as it has been parodied everywhere from 'Family Guy' and 'The Simpsons' to a 'Terry's Chocolate Orange' advert.I'm not looking forward to the next film ('Temple Of Doom' (1984)) as much. It is the weakest of the four (Yes, I like 'The Kingdom Of The Crystal Skull' (2008)), but temple does hold a certain nostalgia about it.I think I could watch every film ever made in the next 40 years and still include 'Raiders' in my top 100."
Geeky Randy,"Jun 22, 2010",8/10,"The first installment into the Indiana Jones Series, which follows the archaeologist/adventurer to Nepal and Egypt for the search of biblical artifact The Ark of the Covenant. Groundbreaking picture; a roller coaster ride of a movie, with premium action sequences—but it fails to give the viewer any room to breathe. Ford is absolutely wonderful and irreplaceable as Dr. Jones, but neither Allen or her character Marion Ravenwood can earn the same keep as the main character. While the film succeeds in fun and thrilling entertainment, there's no excuse for the action in your climatic sequence to be far more inferior than the nail-biting close-calls that preceded it. Denholm Elliott and John Rhys-Davies are SO underused.**½ (out of four)"
Prismark10,"Mar 10, 2023",10/10,"Originally conceived by George Lucas and Philip Kaufman.Raiders of the Lost Ark took shape once Steven Spielberg came on board as director. The visual effects were top notch and the humour level went up by several beats.He revitalised a concept that was meant to be a pastiche of the 1930s adventure serials.Spielberg lucked out by getting Harrison Ford as the lead. Sorry Tom Selleck, but maybe Magnum was your thing.Ford plays the tough no nonsense but snake fearing archaeologist/grave robber (delete as appropriate) Indiana Jones. Mild and meek college professor by day. Adventurer during his holidays.The US government has hired Jones to find the legendary Ark of the Covenant. It is going to be a race against the Nazis who have hired the mercenary Frenchman Dr Belloq (Paul Freeman) to get to it first.It is a globe trotting race as Jones teams up with old flame Marian Ravenswood (Karen Allen) who has vital information.There is a nice scene early on, where Indiana Jones gives a key plot point to the government agents. That is then mirrored in the climax. It is something that has been copied since in other movies.Both Spielberg and Lucas have never managed to top the first Indiana Jones movie. It is a rollicking adventure yarn with scares and thrills. One of the best movies of the 1980s."
davyd-02237,"Apr 13, 2020",6/10,"I cannot give it more than 6, simply because ""biblically"" this is quite inaccurate. Its never going to happen that ""ghouls"" and such like charge out of the Ark of the Covenant"" and kill all those stood around it/near it...Speilberg has presented a great story here until ""the box is opened"" and that brings out the ""theatrics"" of film where the director speculates as to the actual power of The Ark of the Covenant. Lots of fun, but don't take it too seriously, especially twhen the archaeologist threatens to destroy the Ark-something he couldn't do if he were to ever find it"
billcr12,"Apr 5, 2012",2/10,"Steven Spielberg and George Lucas had the idea to recreate the Saturday morning serials of the 1940s with Raiders. Harrison Ford is Indiana Jones, a globe trotting adventurer looking for the Ark of the Covenant which would give Hitler the power to conquer world. Mr Ford always appears to be sleepwalking through his roles; somebody please wake him up. Robert Mitchum had a similar style, except Bob had charisma which is missing in Harrison.Indiana battles Nazis, fights off snakes, makes several great escapes and moves around enough to be awarded frequent flyer miles. Back and forth we go with the Ark, to the point where I did not care at all.One chapter was quite enough for me; I have no desire to suffer through the many sequels that followed."

freethinkingworld,"May 21, 2023",9/10,"A charming classic that never gets old! This is one of those movies that hard to say anything about it cause it's all already been said. This movie firstly has the iconic Stephen Spielberg in the directors chair and the beloved George Lucas as a writer. It has a iconic soundtrack that is like 2001 A Space Odyssey with the amount of importance it plays to cinema history. Overall it's a perfect Action Adventure through and through. The story is paced perfectly by giving you scenes where you learn about the plot, but it also has a healthy amount of action. Harrison Ford and Karen Allen are perfect Main characters with thier charisma and charm. There is really nothing else to say about it honestly!"
g-96059,"Apr 21, 2020",8/10,"World war ii and the nazis are woven into the story around a lost ark of the testimony -- the magaffin that Lucas believes in (because it all falls apart at the end of the film). The elements of adventure, humor, special effects and horror make the film as attractive as it is to the audience. In particular, Jones, the seemingly weak hero, has repeatedly saved the day with his wit and courage, which makes it a charming halo. Jones topped americans' list of 20th century movie heroes, but so did Harris ford's performance and charisma."

It's got everything every action movie should have that many of this particular genre in today's time are missing, character development, relationships (whether friendship,family, or romance), witty jokes that are pulled out at the time, suspense, human weaknesses, and guts. Hollywood needs to learn from the classics (and I don't mean we should re make the stinking film, which has become a trend in the industry lately, i suppose for some fast bucks)"
Hayden-Pro,"Feb 7, 2017",N/A,"Watching this movie as a child filled me with awe and wonder. I was taken to another place and time filled with mystery, adventure and danger. I'd never seen anything like it.The most thrilling part of the movie was how the scenes unfolded. A scene would start with slow tension; Harrison Ford making his way down a trail. The pace would pick up as he encountered a surprise. The scene would return to calm tension. Suddenly, with no warning, chaos! Ford running for his life. It was a roller-coaster of emotion and adrenaline.Although this movie is much older now, as am I, it will always hold a special place in my heart."
smilesigns,"Mar 29, 2005",8/10,Harrison Ford acts brilliantly as a 1930's superhero/ Anthropologist. This film and its predecessors kept me at the end of my seat. I found few if any boring moments in this movie. The story line kept me guessing and wondering if all would turn out well. Even the love story parts kept me watching with held breath. The story kept me guessing about what events were to unfold and I never did predict them correctly. This movie is an original and stands out as a real classic. Harrison Ford was at his best. The story never looses its pace and stays believable. In addition this is a film where the characters have been well developed and the script stays clear and clean.
haakonrasmussen,"Dec 21, 2020",7/10,"I had good time watching Raiders of the Lost Ark, but I wasn't blown away. The movie had a simple, but great plot. It started off strong with the action-packed opening, and this action sustained throughout the whole movie. This abundence of dramatic scenes was very entertaining to watch. However, I was burnt out with this action by the end, and the movie lost my interest.
I was impressed by the dissonant, but fitting soundtrack. This supported the action scenes, and created a more detailed fictional world. The cinematography was beautiful aswell, which combined with the soundtrack made a very enjoyable audiovisual experience.
Overall I would say this movie was pretty good. In my opinion it wasn't remarkable, but I enjoyed it."
carlssonaiden,"Apr 1, 2021",10/10,"This is one of my personal favourite movies of all time. The effects was ahead of its time, the action is perfect and couldnt be done better. And even if i have seen the movie millions of times i still get excited everytime i see it. And i think you will too."
alexanderliljefors,"Mar 23, 2023",10/10,"Is there a better mystery or adventure film that captures all the emotions on the spectrum of curiosity, desire and excitement? No, thought so. Indiana jones gives you everything you want from a really really good movie. The movies are a must if you have an interest in movies or just want to see really good movies. The phenomenon has taken the world by storm and given rise to a major cultural phenomenon that everyone can relate to. With the final film coming out in the summer of 2023, when the entire film series ends, it will be sad to say goodbye to this iconic character. Brilliant films on all levels! The way the films are made is so good that all the films are clearly ahead of their time!"
zzhhhqing,"Apr 27, 2020",10/10,"Blu-ray revisited, Amy was right. Even without the role of Indiana Jones, it had no effect on the plot. The Nazis found the Ark of the Covenant, opened it, and finally died. But without Dr. Jones being handsome, what else would you like to see in this film?"
OllieSuave-007,"Jun 15, 2007",8/10,"Indiana Jones is, I think, one of the best characters in cinema history. A whip-cracking adventurer, he searches for missing treasures while fighting evil. In this film, Indy is hired by the U.S. Government to find the Ark of the Covenant. It is believed that it holds the ten commandments, and he and his ex-flame Marion must also fend off Hitler agents from getting their hands on it. What results is a movie with pure adventure and entertainment; a brilliant cast, great direction, rousing music score (John Williams' Indiana Jones themes is probably one of the most recognizable and memorable in movie history) and beautiful place settings, from the villages of Egypt to the Arc of the Covenant. It's a great film, but I personally enjoyed Temple of Doom and the Last Crusade more. I just think the stories and action to those two films were more spirited and compelling.Just a funny note, as Indiana Jones being of the most memorable fictional characters, I actually parodied him in a college skit. It was fun; our skit was voted the best in the class.Grade B"
capitanotm,"Jul 3, 2023",7/10,"If i was born in 70s or even 60s, and i was 10-20 years old when this came out i would most definitely be crazy hyped up and thrilled and overwhelmed of such a joy and excitement.Since i was born in 90s i watch many movies from 80s and 90s while growing up, and even in 00' when i was reaching 20 years of age i loved those movies, with Jan Klod Van Dame, Stallone, Shwarceneger, and as well as this movie and those of this age, and i really really liked them, they were amazing.But, when i now watch those movies - its just not the same, new age brought in many many new standards and this is in terms of acting, of cgi, of choreography pretty below standard.Plot is pretty predictable and only good thing that is often missed this days is story and dynamic and action in such movies, that is what they should've kept in movies today, good stories as a most important thing.From todays pov - 6 is the most i can give, but for those times when i enjoyed it as then i didnt know better, i would give it 8-9 definitely.So all in all i ll give it a 7. And now i ll be watching all parts since last part just arrived in theaters , and i will rate them all, so we will see what changed and what improved.Anyway if you like Indiana Jones - must see."
ameliacard2,"Mar 26, 2006",10/10,"I really love all of the Indiana jones' movies. When i went to Disney world in Florida when i was 4 I saw a stunt out of this movie so the film always reminds me of that lol But anyway..I think Harrison ford is amazing as Indiana and I can't imagine any one else playing the part. He is so fit when hes got his shirt half undone and hes got his whip hehe. There are some great action scenes in this film and it will have you on the edge of your seat on some parts. I always worry that Indiana will end up being killed but it never happens just like Bond never gets killed...Hes too cute to kill. Any way...I would definitely recommend watching this film, It has a bit of everything, romance, action and comedy. Its great!"
georgt-23858,"Mar 20, 2021",4/10,"I recall when I watched this film in the 80s, I was impressed. It had everything, a ride on a horse and on a submarine, the use of swords and a bazooka, and more notably, impeccable special effects.40 years later, the visual effects seem a bit funny and the plot weaknesses are more striking. The movie can be seen only as a historical relic, like the ark itself."
petshopcoy,"Feb 20, 2019",10/10,"The best adventure film of all time. I was 4 years-old when I saw it on the movies. And I have seen it anytime is shows on TV. One of the best heros in the movies in a perfect movie, with a fantastic soundtrack. Who doesn't want to search for antiques when hear the main song? A must see movie."
Dave-79,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"The opening scene is better than the climax for most action/adventure films out there.  You don't have time to think, but you don't have to.  You can just sit back for the ride.  The best rollercoaster of a film I've seen."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jan 20, 2020",9/10,"'Raiders Of The Lost Ark (1981)' is pretty much a perfect movie, entertaining and iconic. It's so severely burnt into pop-culture that it's easy to forget just how amazing it really is. Spielberg's direction is phenomenal and shockingly efficient. The flick's several superb, subtle long-takes prove he's the absolute master of blocking, transitioning from shot-type to shot-type in a ballet of underplayed choreography. There isn't a single frame in the film that doesn't need to be there. The action sequences are exciting, pacy and palpable; they're some of the most enjoyable of their kind. The experience as a whole is just pure fun from beginning to end. It has aged in some areas (Indy and Marion's previous tryst is supposed to have taken place when she was either fifteen or seventeen, depending on whether you believe the initial script and novelisation or the 2008 character guide) but it's effortlessly entertaining and wonderfully constructed nevertheless. It deserves all the praise it gets. 9/10."
nishanp-93171,"Feb 2, 2019",9/10,"Just finished watching.To my way of thinking,This is the best movie i ever watched.A brilliant work from Spielberg.No words to describe the movie.Amazing."
agduncan-69484,"Apr 17, 2021",10/10,"I mean it's just non stop fun. I can't say any more than what has already been said, but I will say it's a masterpiece. It's probably Spielberg's first or second best. If you haven't seen it go watch it. If you have seen it go watch it anyway."
aditbiju,"Jul 13, 2023",10/10,"Whenever I watch this movie, Raiders of the Lost Ark, it feels like you are in an adventure with Indiana Jones. Like wow, you are in the journey as us the audiences of being part of an action-adventure journey with him. That is what I like about going to the movies with Star Wars and Indiana Jones, you are in this journey with them. It feels so fun to be part of the journey.George Lucas and Steven Spielberg made an well-made film that is PERFECT to watch over and over. I would recommend this first gem that is Raiders of the Lost Ark, and then maybe The Last Cursade with Sean Connery in the mix. Harrison Ford is great as Indiana Jones and we will be following him in journey on-screen for us audiences to enjoy!"
ryanadavis-62779,"Dec 31, 2023",N/A,"Raiders of the Lost Ark directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Harrison Ford as archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones who is hired by the U. S. government to locate the legendary Ark of the Covenant before the Nazis can obtain its awesome powers.This movie is amazing. I absolutely love this movie. Steven Spielberg did a fantastic job directing this movie. And I love Harrison Ford as archaeologist and adventurer Indiana Jones. The music is phenomenal, the writing is excellent, the acting is brilliant, I love the storyline. I love this movie and I will always love it and it will always be one of my favourite Spielberg films of all time."
rubovisk-51976,"Aug 6, 2020",6/10,"This movie has an average storyline, but action scenes are completely dumb, lacking more explanation about HOW do indiana jones get here and there! A lot of scene cuts when the viewer wants to know HOW!! In the end when the ark is opened is very disapointing , roughs effects point to an hasty ending. Average for me. Could be much better."
camillemurray82,"May 3, 2006",10/10,"these elements of adventure: Nazi's, treasure, exotic locations, our generations kind of Count of Monte CristoWhat Dumas's novel was to nineteenth century readers, especially teens and children at the time, is what Indiana Jones is to contemporary movie lovers. I know the two story lines do not parallel each other that specifically, but the feeling in both, the great adventure with good and evil and money and relics and danger and women and secret identities and exotic locations.All of those things are in both movies. They both get that child in you who believes in being a hero to come out, to dream a little. We should all watch this movie at different epochs in our lives to see if it makes us feel the same thing."
schoolappropriate,"May 22, 2012",7/10,A movie of an epic adventure of a college teacher looking for the arch of the Jewish religion racing against the Nazis looking for immortality in battle. Indiana goes across the world in search of Maggie and her talisman from her father. As this tail unravels he finds many troubles along the way funding being the most basic and fastest solved he comes to life and limb from the beginning. If you've got children I highly suggest this title but pending on the generation you're from myself being in the age of technology looking for it's peak i didn't really care for it though if i'd have seen it 11 maybe even 13 years ago i'd have been on the edge of my seat the whole time.
bilging,"May 22, 2025",1/10,"This movie is somehow both chaotic and slow, with a plot that feels like it was stitched together from random action scenes and convenient coincidences. Indiana Jones is supposed to be this iconic hero, but honestly, he mostly stumbles around while everything happens to him rather than because of him.The action is loud but not exciting, the dialogue is stiff, and the pacing is all over the place. And don't get me started on the logic holes-there are moments where things happen just because the script needs them to, not because they make any sense. The villain is forgettable, the characters are paper-thin, and the film leans way too hard on dated tropes that just don't hold up today.Worst of all, for an ""adventure"" film, it feels surprisingly lifeless. There's no real sense of danger, mystery, or emotional investment."
ennsis,"Dec 11, 2018",10/10,"Taken place in 1938 USA, Dr. Jones must face a band of Nazi's while trying to find a religious artifact known as the Lost Ark. Indiana Jones meets up with his ex girlfriend and enlists her as well as a friend from Egypt to help him find and keep the Ark even with a battalion of Nazis on their tail.
The costumes and props were essential to the way this movie was perceived through the eyes of the public during the time period that it came out in (1981). There were costumes that clearly showed the line between the good (USA) and the evil (Nazi Germany). Dr. Jones and his friends are almost constantly battling for what they know is right and are wiling to risk it all in order to safely keep the world safe from the evil plans of those that wish for world domination."
felice-reviews,"Jan 10, 2019",10/10,"I re-watched Raiders a couple of months ago and, 30 something years after its release, I can find no real flaws.Rewatching Raiders this time I did notice a lot of Spielberg style similarities from movie to movie. For example, the scene where Indie chases the caravan of military vehicles reminded me of the look of Duel, Spielberg's first movie. And the way the faces melted and the way the ghosts and skeletons were animated, that was similar to Poltergeist, which Spielberg wrote. But just because he re-purposed techniques doesn't make Raiders of the Lost Ark any less grand.Raiders is as American a movie as you can get. With a swarthy hero, a loud mouth dame, and a whole lotta double cross. Remind you of any other movie about an artifact? Maybe with 'Maltese' in the title?Sure it's not 100% original and sure the effects are a bit dated but you could watch it right now and be entertained all the way through. And for that I give it an A+.Best line in the movie - 'Holy smoke my friend I'm so pleased you are not dead!'"
gentleman-84413,"Mar 5, 2021",9/10,"I think one of the best Steven Spielberg's movie in early 80s. Most appropriate story for this film and best role for Harrison Ford and other actors and brilliant worked from producer, director, actors, writer, camera man, editors, and so.. I loved it, even in 2021 still mood."
Balder_,"Feb 7, 2015",10/10,"There is no doubt in my mind that Indiana Jones is the best movie francaise in the history of cinema. This is my all time favorite film. This is simply the best action film ever made. That will stand the test of time forever. I've seen Raiders of the Lost Ark numerous times, with no lesser joy. This film has it all: action, romance, comedy, and suspense. From the start to the end you are hooked to this movie. I just love every bit of it. Harrison Ford is one of my all time favorite actor, he brings THE greatest and most charismatic character on the silver screen in this Steven Spielberg and George Lucas collaboration. Indiana Jones is the likable, stubborn, intelligent, and determinedan archaeologist adventurer with his trademark hat, whip, leather jacket, and pistol he spends his time traveling all over the world through jungles, deserts, oceans, and caverns in search for hidden treasures. He escapes countless dangers, including fighting thugs in a busy Cairo bazaar, and hangs underneath a fast-moving truck in an exciting chase through a dusty road, just to name a few. You can't forget John William's classic score which is one of those themes that just everybody in the world knows. Steven Spielberg wanted to bring back the classic B-film adventure movies. Instead, he created one of the most revolting and loved films of all time. All three Indiana Jones stories were entertaining but this first one is still the best. I would think most people would agree with me on that. They would also agree this film has some very memorable scenes, - like the opening one with the gigantic boulder chasing Indy - to the ending scene with the Ark of the Convenant opened - that will be Hollywood classics for years to come. This will always be considered the greatest adventure film of all time."
wisemantonofski,"Feb 4, 2019",10/10,"If the concept of adventure were a man, his name would be Indiana Jones (Harrison Ford), and that's what this film is, its an adventure plain and simple. Ford fully encapsulates the idea of the action hero without descending into either the muscle bound strongman or the camp geek traps. Raiders of the Lost Ark plays like an adventure serial condensed into a single narrative, combining elements of Western action with an archaeological edge that would make games like Tomb Raider and Uncharted popular in the 90s and 00s. But what makes this movie work is the comic satire surrounding Ford's character, as though the film is making fun of itself as it goes along, and its that style of cinematic comedy which makes it one of the most watchable action adventures of all time."
Riddler2,"Nov 20, 2014",N/A,Raiders of the Lost Ark the greatest adventure movie of all time nothing tops it nothing! Harrison Ford stars as the bull whip loving archaeologist and Karen Allen is his longtime girlfriend Marion Ravenwood!. They are the greatest on screen couple in the history of film! The story is simple but fun and really entertaining once the adventure gets going but you need the backstory first before the adventure can begin and it is a supernatural force not something to be taken lightly but it is a force of supernatural power that can control everything in your grasp! The direction of this heart stopping movie is phenomenal and something as I said earlier will never be bettered! The Master of film really needed a miracle after the failure of 1941 and boy did he make a adventure classic he really did! I want to talk about John Williams's Theme which is so iconic you can hum it straight away I mean I know every part of the theme every single section of the music I can follow the film along and notice every thrilling trumpet solo and every beat and action the music provides just every section of that unforgettable theme is memorable even the love theme of Marion and Indy's relationship is so perfect! There are some special scenes that are perfect for studying film and it's needs to entertain the fist fight the truck chase are perfect examples of this! John's music scores both of those scenes and all the action scenes the basket game and the Arab swordsman who Indy shoots in the film's best moment of comedy are all scored beautifully and perfectly! Every time the theme is played you know Indy is doing something heroic or heart stopping because you associate the theme with Indy and the adventure and every time the music does not play it means Indy is not on the screen it could be Marion or the Germans that is so important to the film and impossible to replicate in an action film! Just a outstanding action film perfect for kids and adults too it brings out the child in all of us!
Ruskington,"Apr 19, 2020",7/10,"I can certainly understand why this film has such a cult following. The direction by Spielberg is as good as you'd expect, with some particularly incredible stunt choreography. This is probably one of the cleanest looking films of the eighties, drenched in vivid colour and containing some dazzling special effects. And of course the John Williams score is iconic and perfectly fitted to the film. But it's Harrison Ford's performance that steals the show and is arguably the main reason for the popularity of the Indiana Jones series. He looks perfect for this role and delivers just the right balance of dryness and bravado, working well with a fairly unimpressive support cast.Despite all this, I never found Raiders to be a particularly good story. It's all a bit excessive and farcical, and having a completely invulnerable lead character just devalues the action scenes. I do feel nostalgia is a big contributor to the film's high ratings, similar to the equally overhyped Rocky series. Good fun but a bit too slapstick to really be considered a classic."
