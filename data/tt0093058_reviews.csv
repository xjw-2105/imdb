brujay-1,"Dec 22, 2006",8/10,"Though I've read only a couple of dozen of the nearly 500 comments on this film, I didn't see any from ex-Marines who'd had the Parris Island experience. I went through PI in 1957. The time period in the picture would have been about 1967, since the in-country sequence includes the '68 Tet Offensive. Little had changed in those 10 years except the switch from M1s to M16s.For the most part Kubrick got Parris Island right on the money. And why shouldn't he have, since his screen DI, Lee Ermey was in fact a real DI before he started acting (he played another DI in ""The Boys of Company C,"" an earlier and lesser Vietnam flick)? He had a built- in technical adviser. The screams and insults and profanity and physical punishment were all part of the DIs armamentarium. When you're facing up to 75 young strangers you need to immediately establish absolute authority and hang on to it for 13 weeks. Furthermore, you want to break the breakable as soon as you can. My platoon had its Private Pyles and though none ended up as he does in ""Full Metal Jacket,"" I remember that they simply disappeared from our ranks, never to be heard from again. Nothing Ermey as Sgt. Hartman does is exaggerated.Kubrick, however, does exaggerate. Speaking of Pyle's ending, it's almost impossible for me to imagine that a recruit could manage to sneak a clip of live rounds away from the rifle range. Every shooter at the range has his own rifle coach, and every single round is very carefully accounted for. Kubrick started the killing one scene too early.I've read that DIs nowadays are forbidden to use the time-honored f-word, and are not allowed to lay hands on recruits. I don't know if that's good or bad for training (I had my face slapped hard my first day of boot camp and that was just for openers), but then all of us old-timers like to brag about how tough it useta be!A final note: It's interesting to compare ""Full Metal Jacket"" to another attempt at a portrayal of Parris Island, Jack Webb's ""The DI,"" made around '55 or '56. Webb tries for authenticity, but as I was to learn a year or so later, his PI was a boy scout camp."
heisenberg12,"Jun 7, 2017",8/10,"I finally got around to watching this for the first time.The first half is a 10/10, the second half is a 7/10 and falls apart into what seems like every war movie's clichés, even though it's good enough.The first half is a masterpiece of filmmaking- there's almost no flaws, the pacing is perfect, the acting great, it has an instant classic type experience to it you'll never forget.The second half is good, decent but it doesn't rival the first half and its perfection. That makes its let down even more pronounced.So overall, I give it an 8/10 because you can't overlook the drop in quality of the second half.8/10"
alanbenfieldjr,"Jun 28, 2017",9/10,"Strange, as I sat to watch Full Metal Jacket for the first time in years, what I remembered most was Lee Emery's Sgt Hartman's rantings and Vincent D'Onofrio. In fact, it was Vincent D'Onofrio's Pvt Lawrence, known as ""Gomer Pyle"" that made this Stanley Kubrick film, truly memorable. I'm noticing this more and more as I get older and revisit old films. The performances, certain performances, even in supporting roles allow a film to keep growing with the passing of time. Full Metal Jacket a shattering film or I should say, two shattering films. The first part, the training, the intro is a masterpiece practically impossible to match up, so, the second part doesn't match it. But, still. A film-experience. Vincent D'Onofrio's performance even more powerful now, 30 years later. Enormous! The British skies over Vietnam is another reminder than an artist's eye knows no boundaries."
1GRUNT,"Feb 22, 2004",N/A,"I was a Marine at Parris Island in 1977 and I can certainly tell this film is very accurate in every respect right down to the blanket party scene. The base that they used in England looks very much like Parris Island, right down to the Grinder and the barracks in the background. The part where they are running on the road with Joker carrying Pyle looks like the road to Elliots Beach. The Cadence is true to life as well as Senior Drill Instructor Hartmans dialect, all of the comments I can say 100% that I have heard on The Island and had them used on me. For a person who was there it had me fooled, although the O-Course and the rifle range are completely different in layout and looks. The inside of the barracks and the head are identical to the real thing. For anyone viewing this film trust me it doesn't get any closer to being Parris Island and I would say that the ""Gunny"" saw to that. As far as the in country segment it looks pretty much like the real photos I saw in USMC training films."
Lechuguilla,"Nov 16, 2009",10/10,"""With flowers and my love both never to come back ... It's not easy facing up when your whole world is black"". So sings the man whose throbbing song marks the film's end, merciless lyrics to describe thematically a story that is as wrenching as it is mesmerizing.There are no villains in this film, only heroic victims. The villains are all off-screen, comfy behind mahogany desks, or dressed for success and giving shrill speeches about how maintaining peace requires war. Strange logic.First it's boot camp, a dreary prospect at best, for an ordinary group of young American men. Here, a sadistic drill Sargent, in colorful language, barks out orders and insults straight from Hades. It's do or die, almost literally, for our greenhorns. It's an ordeal of blackness from which some may never recover. Still, the grunts learn a valuable lesson; namely, that life is mostly physical, not mental. It's a lesson some ivory tower college professors never learn.But then it's on to an even blacker black ... Vietnam. Combat scenes are rendered believable by effective visuals and terrific sound effects: pounding percussion, amplified sounds of equipment and footsteps across explosive debris, and an always present, ever-so-subtle ... echo. Potent and torturous, these scenes convey a Zen-like immediacy, an impending sense of doom. And then at film's end, those lyrics ...Composed of two, barely overlapping, parts, the script's structure is a bit unorthodox. But the film works, owing to an intensity that never lets up. R. Lee Ermey is of course terrific as the harsh drillmaster. Casting of the young lions is okay, though a tad weak in one or two cases. Insertion of pop songs of the era works well, to amplify the cultural disconnect between a war-torn Vietnam and an indifferent America.Like reading a history book, watching an occasional war movie is good for the soul. It puts one's problems in perspective. For that reason, this particular war movie is better than most. It's riveting, intense. And the sense of impending blackness hovers ever present over the story's heroic victims, like the sword of Damocles."
ReelCheese,"Jul 18, 2006",8/10,"The first half of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is so intensely entertaining that director Stanley Kubrick can be forgiven for the slight come-down that follows. The opening scenes draw us into the strict world of ""maggots"" training to join the ranks of real men, otherwise known as Marines. We see the characters humiliated, yelled at like children, beaten and, in one tragic case, broken down. It's an unpleasant yet fascinating place to visit from the comfort and safety of our living room couches. Yet once the action shifts to the Vietnam War, when you would expect even better, something is lost. The characters seem less real and the atmosphere less intriguing. Overall, however, there aren't many faults to find with this effort, but be forewarned that it's certainly not for younger viewers."
Peach-2,"Dec 10, 1998",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket seems like an uncompleted film, but to me that's poetic justice to one of America's uncompleted wars. The film is harsh and doesn't turn a blind eye to the atrocities of Vietnam. Kubrick is the true master of atmosphere in film. He makes you feel like you are there. Friends of mine have commented that they only like the first half of the film and that the second half falls apart. I believe Kubrick sets up the first half to be an understandable reflection of the terror that would eventually enter the lives of these soldiers during war. It is easy to identify with being picked on because we all have in some way. Not all of us, on the other hand, have fought in war. Kubrick is the master."
ivo-cobra8,"Oct 14, 2015",10/10,"SPOILER: Full Metal Jacket is a 1987 realistic Vietnam war film and is one of the best films of the 80's ever made, directed and produced by Stanley Kubrick. The screenplay by Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford was based on Hasford's novel The Short-Timers (1979). Full Metal jacket (1987) was Nominated for 1 Oscar. Another 7 wins & 9 nominations. It is one of my personal favorite war movies. I love this movie to death.A superb ensemble falls in for for Stanley Kubrick's brilliant saga about the Vietnam War and the dehumanizing process that turns people into trained killers. Joker (Matthew Modine), Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Gomer (Vincent D'Onofrio), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Cowboy (Arliss Howard) and more experience boot-camp hell pit bulled by a leather lung D.I. (Lee Ermey) viewing would-be devil dogs as grunts,maggots or something less. The action is savage, the story unsparing the dialog spiked with catching humor. From Basic training rigors to Hue City combat nightmare, Full Metal Jacket scores a cinematic direct hit.The film focus on a two-segment look at the effect of the military mindset and war itself on Vietnam era Marines. The first half follows a group of recruits in boot camp under the command of the punishing Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. In the hell camp the dehumanizing process turns people into trained killers. From boys in to a trained mean machine killers. It's the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U.S. Marine Corps Training Camp, where a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the brutal Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), and the focus of Hartman's brutality, because the overweight boy cannot keep up with the other more physically fit recruits in the grueling obstacle courses. The first half more focus on training basics preparing recruits before they ship them to Vietnam and point view story telling from Private James T. ""Joker"" Davis (Matthew Modine) and about torture physics of a young men who is a marine recruit in the platoon lead by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman his Parris Island drill instructor who tortures him by punish his whole squad for his mistakes. And how that young man turns in to a killing mean machine that blows Hartman's head off! And than Pyle sits down on a toilet, places the muzzle of the weapon in his mouth and pulls the trigger, killing himself.The second half shows one of those recruits, Joker, covering the war as a correspondent for Stars and Stripes, focusing on the Tet offensive. The film now more focus on one of those recruits Private Joker (Matthew Moddine) from the boot camp Parris Island, who is in Da Nang Vietnam, reporting on the Vietnam War for the military newspaper Stars and Stripes. He and his partner, combat photographer Rafterman (Kevyn Major Howard), meet a prostitute (Leanne Hong) in the streets and encounter a thief (Nguyen Hue Phong) who steals Rafterman's camera. When they return to their base, they are given new assignments, but Joker wants to go to the front lines to get a good story. Joker and Rafterman are assigned to Phu Bai, a Marine forward operating-base near the ancient Vietnamese city of Hue, Joker is reunited with his team recruit from his training boot camp Paris Island, Cowboy and his unit, the Lusthog Squad, before they met Cowboy's Unit they are go trough They go to the mass grave and find over 20 bodies in a mass grave that have been covered with lime.The film is Staney Kubrick's best realistic Vietnam War film of all time. One of my all time favorite Vietnam War flicks from the 80's, the other film is Platoon (1986) Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL. I love how the film focus more in a city of Hue and the battlefield starts their. The battle scene sequences are outstanding and Terrific!They look real, There are dozen's of body's out their. We first see Tank driving trough the city of Hue the city's are filed with fire, burning buildings and destroyed houses and street is full of blood. Sergeant Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin),the nihilistic M60 machine gunner of the Lusthog Squad is one of the most beloved characters in the movie and he is at best a supporting cast member. But you wouldn't even think about Animal Mother being just another guy. He is so memorable that you look at him as one of the stars of the show.'Born to Kill' - written on Joke's helmet. Is sequent that it has to do with the ""duality of Man"" according to Jung. 10/10"
jamtin1,"Jan 13, 2006",10/10,"Goddamn you Stanley Kubrick. For me Clockwork Orange set the standard a long time ago for cinematic perfection; FMJ just raises the bar. Sitting around with bored in-laws I quietly slipped this into the DVD player, 20 minutes later conversation has ceased and everybody is absorbed. Predictable Kubrick really, stunningly lit, musical soundtrack that is oh-so-right, and the cinematography -Jesusmotherofmary. Ten years before anybody had thought of picking up a movie camera and running with it, Kubrick had perfected the technique. War is hell? -it sure looks a vision of hell. Stunning in every way."
thomasgouldsbrough,"Mar 1, 2022",8/10,"Full Metal Jacket is an excellent war film. All the characters are very well written, and represent very common characters in the military. There's always a class clown, a hardened individual that's respected, and someone who just isn't capable. The acting of Vincent D'Onofrio in this is exceptional, he only has a short amount of screen time, but his story is very sad and impactful. The second half of the film starts to become less enjoyable, but nevertheless it's still a good film."
FKDZ,"Mar 1, 2022",7/10,"Arguably the first half of this movie is what this movie is remembered by. It's a incredible piece of acting and writing. It fully engages you and doesn't really let you go. Though it does at a moment become predictable where it will end. But being the bare witness to the demoralization and dehumanization of humans to turn them into killing machines is somewhat unmatched.The second half however is underwhelming. Few of the things seen truly feel impactful and that's also due to the somewhat underwhelming performance, writing and directing of Pvt. Joker. I don't know why they did it but his emotional vulnerability is all over the place, one moment he doesn't even care about a fallen squad member, and then he does, there's no transition. And it made the character unbelievable and thus ruined much of the emotional turmoil for me. The second half felt simpler and cheaper to me in general, dumb, ignorant soldiers in a war they aren't supposed to be in. The acting just felt somewhat flat as well. Like the banter between Joker and Animal Mother. And the anti-war message was lacking to say the least due to a lack of visual despair and agony.The directing and music is fantastic (though not that bird song..ugh), not much more to say there than you'll hear more than enough iconic soundtracks and beautifully shot scenes (set design mostly). Some practical effects and such feel lacking though and is inconsistent, one guy gets shot, blood splatters everywhere, another guy gets shot, and nothing, just falls down to the ground unconvincingly. This was especially bad during a ambush scene at basecamp where the enemies just ''played dead'' it seemed and fell with grace.So yeah, I'll remember this movie for its first half, but I almost already forgot most of the second half...definitely not one of Kubrick's best."
Aidan McGuinness,"Nov 5, 2002",N/A,"I like Kubrick's stuff. Generally any movie he directed was several notches, in quality terms, above any other director (particularly those working nowdays). Does `Full Metal Jacket' continue to show the mastermind behind `2001', `The Shining' and `Dr. Strangelove'? Yup, it does.As plots go. there isn't much here. I don't particularly care because the script makes up for it. `Full Metal Jacket' is very much a movie of two halves - the first half dealing with a group of conscripts in training at military camp and the hardships they endure under their `hard-as-nails' instructor. The second half is about their exploits in Vietnam itself. Fights? In 'Nam? Haven't we seen all that before? Yes, but rarely with such an experienced hand at work. And it's the camp scenes that are so wonderful.Gustav Hasford et. Al. have produced an excellent script, particularly for the opening hour. There's barely a moment's pause before you're thrown into the screaming face of Sergeant Hartman. He's hurling abuse at his new recruits with lines so forceful and sharp they'll have you gasping in shock while simultaneously laughing in incredulity. It's the way the script runs in without a pause for breath that helps so wonderfully - and the fact that it's so powerful. It's never just about one-liners from a sergeant, it's also telling a story about how humans work under these conditions. The first half is about how they suffer under their own at home (and very well told it is too), the second half about the human condition under the duress of war. It's an interesting comparison, and a tale well told. The battle may lack some sort of overall context or resolution, but then I feel that's in keeping with the movie - it's about the individual, and not the war, and such elements cannot be easily quantified.All the characters have a grounded `real world' feel to them, due to both the material and the versatility of the actors. R. Lee Emery is viciously delightful as the manic Sergeant Hartman, while managing to add occasional touches of humanity and a `this is for your own good' attitude through subtle gestures. Matthew Modine is the amiable lead, Private Joker, and as such balances the hard and soft edges admirably (if not spectacularly). The other stand out though is Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Gomer Pyle, the recruit picked upon by Hartman and the other cadets. There's a wonderful innocence about him in the beginning, which transforms into a frightening hardening of his soul later on. The evil/beyond-hope look he gives later on (anyone who has seen the movie will know the one I mean), remains as the most frightening look I've ever seen depicted onscreen. All in all the cast accredit themselves well here.And so to the direction. It's Kubrick. It's good. Once more there's excellent cinematography - check out the haunting, almost claustrophobic landscapes of Vietnam. There's some lovely use of filters (that haunting blue). There's a brilliant subtle score, that's eerie when used, but never intrusive. There's a very good command of pace - the viewer is never left idle or bored, and the story (particularly in the tremendous first half) flows along smoothly. Great touches abound throughout - check out the many examples, such as the opening scene of Hartman marching right up to the recruits (and to the camera), spitting and screaming vindictive comments, almost as if at the viewer. Some may criticise the almost disconnected feeling you have in the battle scenes towards the end, but I found their stillness, their quietness, and raw power, far more effective than the flash-bang wizardry employed in tripe such as `We Were Heroes'. I can blather on about Kubrick for ages. so I'll stop now.Is `Full Metal Jacket' perfect? Not quite because of the `two halves' syndrome. Although they do contrast and complement one another, the first half is very much the stronger half. The second feels weaker against it. In and of itself the second half would normally be regarded well, but it doesn't have the visceral power that the first does. I love both bits, but I do love one bit more. This makes the movie suffer just a little. There's so much to like here though that I can't criticise too much - and so much to cherish (especially in the lines delved out). Once more the main man succeeds. Definetely worth seeing. 9/10."
Agent10,"Apr 28, 2002",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick always managed to bring something new to his palate whenever he made a film. He brought dark comedy to the screen with Dr. Stranglove, an epic story with Spartacus, and a film more important for its efforts than box office potential in the film Paths of Glory. This is what makes Full Metal Jacket so entertaining.Humor, horror and political commentary are the themes which shape Full Metal Jacket. From the overbearing drill sergeant to the war loving soldiers. It all seems to make sense within this film, never overstepping its bounds or being to subtle. Kubrick may have alienated some his hardcore fans with such a mainstream-type story, but then again, he helped mainstream movies take a bold step. What doesn't the current cinema owe Kubrick?"
AaronCapenBanner,"Sep 16, 2013",7/10,"R. Lee Ermey dominates this Stanley Kubrick directed Vietnam War drama, as he plays profane, no-nonsense, ultra tough Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, who belittles, browbeats, and insults the marine recruits in brutal boot camp training. Vincent D'Onofrio plays a slow-witted recruit who gets it the worst from Hartman, until he finds out that he is quite good at shooting... Mathew Modine plays ""Joker"", since he has an overt sense of humor that also captures the attention of Hartman, whose relentless, unmerciful verbal attacks take their toll in ways he didn't imagine... Film then picks up later, as Joker is a war correspondent for Stars & Stripes, who witnesses first hand the insanity of Vietnam...R. Lee Ermey so dominates the first half of the film(in an unforgettable, searing portrayal of dehumanization) that, when his part is over, it leaves a looming shadow over the rest of the film that is never lifted, though it is still a well-presented look at the war, though nothing exceptional. Worth watching for Ermey, who should have received an Academy Award!"
guy-bellinger,"Nov 30, 2004",9/10,"One of the greatest war movies ever, a statement very few will dispute. I will therefore not illustrate this point : thousands have done it before me, often brilliantly.I'd rather lay the stress on Kubrick's modernity in ""Full Metal Jacket"". Indeed the USA being once again at war, it is interesting to compare the way they wage war these days with the way they did back in the sixties. And the comparison is edifying. Just apply the following statements to Iraq and you will realize NOTHING HAS CHANGED : - the marines are trained to become killing machines without being taught minimum knowledge about the people they come to defend. - the boys know nothing about the Vietnamese and reason according to American standards : for instance ""Cow-Boy"" complains half-jokingly half-seriously that there are no horses in Vietnam. Another example is the soldiers singing the Mickey Mouse Club hymn after fighting, which strikes as particularly out of place. - they try in vain to impose democracy through gruesome violence and destruction. Such similarities abound and testify to the film's absolute - and unfortunate - modernity. I wish Kubrick was still with us. I also wish George Bush and his advisers had seen this masterpiece and - most of all - understood its message. They would have avoided another bloody war doomed to fail."
daanyesyes,"Apr 30, 2020",7/10,"I watched it for the first time now, and i thought that the first half of the movie was great. The second half though was boring and wasnt that exciting. It is not the 8 worthy"
tr91,"Sep 9, 2013",N/A,"'Full Metal Jacket' was a film that I had been meaning to watch for a while after all the good stuff I had heard about it.It really is a film of two halves, unfortunately I didn't like the 2nd half.The 1st half at boot camp was excellent, we saw a lot of character development and emotion as well as a lot of humour and really serious issues. R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were just brilliant.The 2nd half I didn't enjoy as much, it looked great and there was a lot of action but it was just a bit boring and felt really dragged out, whereas the 1st part just had everything that you wanted.Glad I got round to seeing it but wouldn't watch it again, slightly disappointed after a really good start to the film.6/10."
jamesrupert2014,"Mar 29, 2022",8/10,"Marine recruits are followed as they endure basic-training at the hands of an abrasive drill instructor and are then deployed to Vietnam in 1968. This was Stanley Kubrick's almost over-the-top contribution to the trend in 'Nam-based anti-war films in the late 1970s and 1980s and may be best known for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman's (Ronald Lee Ermey) eloquently imaginative foul diatribes as he torments the neo-jarheads, especially pudgy incompetent Pte. Leonard (Vincent D'Onofrio ), or 'Pyle' as he is immediately christened. The war scenes are quite good, especially the lengthy set piece about the VC sniper in the ruined factory and, as expected from the auteur, the cinematography and direction is excellent. Many of the characters seemed to be almost caricatures, with minimal 'back story' and 'new names' (their boot camp nicknames remain with them), and although this was likely part of the 'message', I found some of the marines, notably 'Animal Mother' (Adam Baldwin) bordered on parody (as did Pyle's demented grimacing when he finally cracks under the consent abuse at the hands of the sadistic Gunny). Good but not quite at the level of 'The Deer Hunter' (1978) or 'Apocalypse Now' (1979). The 'Mickey Mouse Club' closing scene is memorable."
bnymph,"Oct 8, 2006",10/10,"A preliminary note: anyone who liked this movie well enough to read comments should know that a considerable amount of detail in both it and _Apocalypse Now_ had origins in a 1968 Japanese novel called Into a Black Sun, by a Japanese war correspondent working in Vietnam at the time. It took about 20 years to be translated into English, but it's in American paperback now. I recommend it.I just saw this movie for the first time since it was deployed in movie theaters in '87. As then, I was knocked out by what a great film it is. I can't help but contrast it with such movies as Apocalypse Now and Barbarians At The Gate, both movies that I admire, but let's face it, they are florid and melodramatic. Full Metal Jacket is anything but. It is so cold and hard in tone that it freezes your bones. At the same time, both the cinematography and sound track are so good, so effective, that the watcher can't look away from the movie.This is classic Kubrick, in my opinion: the correct correlation of visual and audio information, with a plot that is so horrifying that one lies awake for awhile."
DeathFish,"Aug 10, 2006",9/10,"This is another Kubrick masterpiece that has pleased people all over the world. This time it is a different kind of a war based movie, and I have to say that it is one of the best if not the best war movie of all time. Many people write that the second half of the movie is bad, or even horrible. I agree that the first part of the movie is the best part, because it shows a completely new side of the lives of marines. No other movie has ever showed that base camp training episode as well as Kubrick does it. It is very psychological and painful to watch these men braking down and then rise as cold-blooded killers. No one shows that as well as ""Gomer Pyle"". As many others I think that the drill Sergeant gives this movie an extra spark with his comical lines and hard personality, he actually makes you laugh, and even so you really get to hate him. The second half is the actual battle in Vietnam. This is where the movie is more similar to other war movies, but yet it is unique. Kubrick is all over the place throughout the entire movie, the camera and sound effects along with the music keeps reminding us that this really is a Kubrick film. The second half is without doubt also amazing, because of the uncensored madness it makes you sick with sorrow and hate. The sniper scene is of course one of the strongest and most terrifying scenes of the second half. Also the interviewing part is a very good idea I think, Kubrick finds yet another way of showing the different mind states of these men. That makes the characters even more real and makes you even more sympathetic for them and their destinies. In every way a breathtaking movie from start to finish. Kubick uses all the methods of making a good war movie, and then some. Besides that the movie is filled with intelligent and poetic lines, beautiful details and symbols, and some of my all time favorite movie quotes. This movie leaves a stain and it will always be high on my personal list of movies. Watch it, enjoy it, watch it again and love it. 10/10"
Exploding Penguin,"May 13, 2003",8/10,"A gritty, intense, no-holds-barred war film that grabs attention from the very beginning and holds it all the way through.  The only detriment to this film is the fact that the first half (Boot Camp) is so much more powerful than the second half (Vietnam).The film is basically about how war sucks the life out of humans and turns them into 'killing machines'.  The greatest performances in this film are of course R. Lee Ermey, the savage drill instructor, and Vincent D'Onofrio, his slow-witted whipping boy.  The viewer alternately laughs and cringes at the relentless abuse and degradation inflicted by the former on the latter.  And at the famous line, ""What is your major malfunction?"", the tension reaches an almost unbearable limit and the viewer ceases to move or breathe.This movie, like many of Kubrick's, is too graphic for many people, but I highly recommend it to those who can withstand its assault on both senses and consciences."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 13, 2011",10/10,"I like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
briancham1994,"Aug 10, 2020",6/10,"This film is essentially two films in one. The first half I would rate 8/10. It is a great and brutal portrayal of the way that the army grinds down human beings. One recruit cannot keep up and tries to take matters into his own hands. The second half I would rate 4/10. Despite being a war film, it is quite slow and boring and this was a total let down. I kept thinking of the first half and wished that was the entire film. I would rate it 6/10 overall."
SquirePM,"Sep 3, 2000",1/10,"Speaking as an actual infantry veteran of Vietnam, I'd like to make two short comments about this film.The first half is excellent.  It is an authentic, though condensed, portrayal of basic training.  Obviously the presence of a real retired drill sergeant (Ermey) had a lot to do with that.But then Kubrick's faulty imagination takes over.  Starting with the climactic latrine scene and carrying throughout the rest of the movie, this film is total hogwash.  I was aghast at the skewed, completely erroneous, just plain wrong depiction of this platoon's actions in the war in Vietnam. Kubrick either had no advisors, or ignored them, when it came to the second half of this movie.  I have never seen such a load of tripe.See FMJ for the first half, and just rewind it and put it back in the box when you get to Vietnam."
thomas8331,"Oct 13, 2004",N/A,"NO SPOILERS! This is a review, not a synopsis.First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think.In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful!The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.10 out of 10, perfect."
gough-84368,"Apr 16, 2022",8/10,"Full Metal Jacket tells a tale of the Vietnam war not in Apocalypse Now or Platoon. I found the first half a profound look into how the soldiers are bred for combat and ridded of traditional morals. Religion is twisted to give them the divine authority to act as God's right hand. The second half, while less profound gives in great detail the brutality of the battlefield and moral conflicts between soldiers. This is not a story that has been told again and again, this is not a propaganda movie, this is a boots on the ground tale of what it meant to be an soldier in the Vietnam War."
SnoopyStyle,"May 29, 2015",9/10,"In Parris Island, South Carolina, a group of raw recruits are brought in to be trained by the hard-nosed Marine Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Joker (Matthew Modine) tries to help the slow Leonard Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) which comes to a sad end. The second half starts with Joker in Da Nang working as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. Then the Tet offensive happens and Joker goes out to report. He's reunited with Cowboy (Arliss Howard) who is leading a rifle squad.The first half is anchored by the great performances of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. They are incredible. The second half is the war. Matthew Modine leads competently but it is the mesmerizing directions from Stanley Kubrick. It is always The Trashmen's Surfin' Bird that comes to mind first. It's impossible to lose interest during the second half. Some people may want it to be more obviously anti-war. It is not quite so blatant. It is murky just like what I imagine the Vietnam experience actually was. The long uncut scenes impart an immersive feel. It is one of the most compelling extended war sequence."
sydmwswy,"Jul 10, 2022",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket is definitely a film that is very far from Kubrick's filmmaking method. And definitely, if it was a successful movie, it would be the best war movie in the history of cinema. But the film does not match the logic of Kubrick's filmmaking and the director's subconscious. The logic of Kubrick's filmmaking is not that, for example, The camera is in favor of the soldier at the beginning of the film, or that it condemns such militarism. This type of narration is definitely simplistic. Maybe my idea also agrees with the director's point of view, but because it is not completely realistic in the movie , The movie is unsuccessful. However, it is a great movie, but it is not the greatest war movie in the history of cinema like ""paths of Glory""."
bkoganbing,"Jul 14, 2015",9/10,"Thirty years after Stanley Kubrick did Paths Of Glory about the futility of World War I Kubrick did Full Metal Jacket about the American experience in Vietnam. The wars were incredibly different and the French were fighting on their own soil, still the frustration of war and the stupidity of the high command make these films markedly similar.Another Vietnam classic came out around the same time Casualties Of War and that dealt with the army. A very different experience to be sure because the army contained draftees and folks in the National Guard and Army Reserve who LBJ did not call up for Vietnam. Hence it was a haven for those of us not quite ready to give up our young lives. It was sure different from the training these guys were getting on Parris Island. In fact many was a night I comforted myself with the thought about what the marines were like.Matthew Modine plays the lead here, a fellow who goes through the training and then is assigned as a journalist to Stars And Stripes. He is the voice of screenwriter and novelist Guy Hasford whose book Full Metal Jacket is based.Today we are in open ended war in the Middle East started to be sure by an attack on our native soil. But we got sidetracked by some old fashioned imperialist objectives in Iraq and now we've got ISIS to contend with. What should our response be? Certainly it has to be a multi-faceted one, it can't all be about dropping bombs on people different from us. It's like we learned nothing from Casualties Of War or Full Metal Jacket.I think if the film has a weakness it's that the training portion of Full Metal Jacket is better than the combat one. That is because of the performances of R. Lee Ermey as the redneck gunnery sergeant and Vincent D'Onofrio as the poor fat slob of a recruit.I cannot emphasize too much that D'Onofrio, Modine, and the rest are all volunteers. That being said I'm at a loss to explain why wasn't D'Onofrio just not washed out. Ermey if he was doing his job properly would have. But he was having too much sadistic fun.That being said when D'Onofrio prepared for the part no doubt he created a back story as to how his character came to Parris Island. I would love to ask D'Onofrio how that came to be.Full Metal Jacket is an enduring war classic and will be shown right along with Paths Of Glory as long as we have means to entertain and educate ourselves."
wes-connors,"Oct 4, 2009",7/10,"The unifying theme of Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket' is that Vietnam put American in the toilet; each of the film's three parts, or ""Acts"", has characters in what is repeatedly described as ""a world of s--t."" The men are successful trained to kill - but, they do not know when to kill, who to kill, or why anyone should die. Narrator protagonist Matthew Modine (as James ""Joker"" Davis) not only wears a ""Peace"" button on his uniform, but also has written ""Born To Kill"" on his helmet (to illustrate the duality of man). The reason for the war is explained, ""We are here to help the Vietnamese because inside every gook there is an American trying to get out.""Probably, the film's strongest ""story"" is told in the first ""Act""; it features drill sergeant R. Lee Ermey (as Hartman) belittling overweight Vincent D'Onofrio (as Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence). This story literally ends in the latrine, where a successfully trained killer demonstrates his ability. Some of the material in the rest of the film becomes very weak, in comparison; especially disappointing are some mid-movie scenes ""staged"" for the camera of ""Stars and Stripes"" photographer ""Rafterman"" (Kevyn Major Howard) - the characters all say silly things for the camera. Still, some near-poetic moments of humor and brutality remain to be seen.******* Full Metal Jacket (6/17/87) Stanley Kubrick ~ Matthew Modine, R. Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Onofrio, Arliss Howard"
vishal_wall,"Sep 22, 2006",10/10,"This film is really scary and easily one of the best films ever made. There are many reasons to say that. Private Pyle is definitely one of the most disturbing character ever written in the history of cinema. Other characters as disturbing as him are Antonio Ricci of 'Bicycle thief', Devdas Mukerjee etc. Beginning is mindblowing. All the characters are defined in the first scene itself. Joker and Pyle stand out as wrong people in the wrong place. Later Joker gets a promotion for his straightforwardness in the first scene. Its interesting because may be thats how officers are identified amongst 'pukes'. Pyle comes across as regular jovial 'fatbody'. What marines make of him is I think the whole concept of the film. Very weird piece of writing.Most of the things have already been discussed so I'll be really short. I'm surprised no one has said anything about the background music. This movie has brilliant background music. All the Pyle's scene are brilliant. 'Last night on the island' will remain one of the best scenes ever shot in the history of cinema. I must admit that I got really scared when I watched it for the first time. Vincent D'Onofrio shocked me in every scene. Very gifted man. I watched the whole film and then I watched the first half twice and some scenes again and again. R. Lee Ermey and Matthew Modine are good too but this is definitely Vincent D'Onofrio's film. ""This is my rifle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". Mind blowing. By the way the order of Joker, cowboy and Pyle keeps changing as Hartman walks in the first scene. Probably Kubrick didn't think that he would have someone watch this film that many times. Masterpiece!!! 10/10."
hitchcockthelegend,"Jun 16, 2009",7/10,"This is the journey undertaken by Private ""Joker"" J.T. Davis, from brutal training camp to Vietnam itself.As most people know by now, Full Metal Jacket is divided very much into two different halves, halves that to me show the best and worst of the talented director, Stanley Kubrick. For the first part we are subjected to the training regime inflicted on wet behind the ears boys, boys soon to become Marines out in the harshness of the Vietnam War. This is real dehumanising stuff, frighteningly essayed by the brilliance of drill instructor R Lee Ermey's performance. We know, see and feel that the boys are primed to be killing machines, unemotional killing machines at that, with Kubrick astutely weaving the brutality of camp into the moral quandary that was the war itself. One particular recruit, Private Gomer (a heartfelt and unnervingly great Vincent D'Onofrio) is the film, and Gustav Hasford's (writer of the novel and co screenwriter here) point of reference in this incredible first half. It's with this strand that ""Jacket"" burns itself into the soul of the viewer, to hopefully set us up for what will be Private ""Joker's"" (Matthew Modine) preparation for the Vietnam conflict.Then it's that second half...Where do we go from here? We already know that ""Joker"" and his mentally brutalised colleagues have been stripped of their basic humanity. Soldiers primed to kill, it's harsh, but true. But Kubrick has already chilled our blood and bludgeoned us repeatedly courtesy of the ""Boot Camp"" set up. Modine's (who isn't strong enough to carry the picture) ""Joker"" is now the film's axis, a clever, most definitely articulate character, who is thrust into the murky and muddled battle of the Tet Offensive, yeah and so? All it amounts to is a prolonged series of rationale and philosophical musings on the false war. Kubrick even shifting to safe mode with a clumsy narration segment spouted by ""Joker"".Full Metal Jacket is a truly fine film, but it's not the brilliant one it really should have been. If one can take the time to venture deeper with the second half, then it doesn't deliver on the already made point promise of the first part. Technically it's flawless, incredibly designed, with Douglas Milsome's cinematography stunningly effective. But I'll maintain to my final day that Full Metal Jacket finished up as being bloody and pretty instead of being a poignant and horrifying masterpiece. 7/10"
alibrahim1,"Mar 25, 2024",5/10,"Honestly, Very overrated. Not bad, but overrated. Nothing special or outstanding. Except for the first part.The first part I really enjoyed. The geeky ""boys"" who had to endure the hard training and Viscous personality of their drill sergeant. Some funny scenes and some showcasing the atrocities they had to endure and the effect it had on their mind and psyche. Which led to the shooting and suicide at the end of the first part.Loved every bit of it, the acting the build up and where the story is going. Honestly, it was heading to become an AMAZING movie!But.....Unfortunately, the second part is where it went south. Very random scenes and not engaging at all. Subpar and cliche war scenes without any point. Just random shooting at buildings. And barely any good acting that show how war is, they barely had any expressions and feelings. Nothing much with the plot (the second half) nor the dialogue. Could have showcased how their minds are affected. Also, why show the atrocious training in boot camp if they don't lose their minds at war or at least show how?Yes, Joker the decent human being who has the peace sign and a good heart was trained brutally to be ""born to kill"".. but what's so weird or mind blowing? The second part was very vague.(note: the highly trained born to kill guy joker drops the weapon like a coward when he saw a girl shooting when had no ammo)Also, the whole movie was background of shooting. Not any memorable score that makes you feel anything regarding the movie.Very average and over hyped."
zetes,"Jul 9, 2001",10/10,"People just refuse to use their brains. They love the first half of Full Metal Jacket, and then basically give up on the second half. It is depressing. Don't you think you should at least try to understand why the film is split up like that? In fact, despite what so many people think, Full Metal Jacket is a perfectly structured opus - one of the most original pieces of art ever created. I am not going to get into it, but I will just say that it is YOUR JOB AS A VIEWER to figure out the connection between the two halves. 10/10."
LOL101LOL,"Jul 14, 2009",10/10,"Saw this film at the age at 22, and just re watched it 22 years later. The brutality of war shocked me at 22 and shocked me again at 44. One of the best war/drama's ever to be put on film, but it got me thinking! When will humanity ever learn? world war 1 and 2, Korea, Vietnam, then the gulf wars, Iraq, Afghanistan, and all the same mistakes made again and again, and all for what? To feed the politicians needs to flex their urge to send young people to the other side of the planet to get wasted? And then when we make so called peace then to invite the enemy to come and live in our countries? Ask your self who is the real winner and loser of all these wars? Great film but think about the reality of it all, voice your views to your local politicians and get our young people to come back home in 1 piece."
johnfortnitekennedy,"Mar 23, 2023",10/10,"Full metal jacket is almost like two completely different movies in one. The first is at the boot camp where we see people being trained to join the soldiery, and the second one takes place during the actual war. Through a series of disturbing and bloody scenes, Stanley Kubrick shows a brutal world of the late 60s, and how military dehumanizes soldiers and turns them into mindless killing machines. The characters are having fun, cracking jokes, showing that even in a place as dangerous as Vietnam, they are still having fun, brutally murdering enemy soldiers. At the end, it's almost as if they realised."
wcshellman,"Mar 17, 2006",8/10,"A gentleman (from France, I won't hold this against him), wrote a comment about the ironies and callousness of the characters of FMJ. I would like to politely disagree with him on several points. As a former marine myself, I went through boot camp at Parris Island, SC, where we were taught to be killers. I was fortunate to never have to do so. In 1998, I was deployed to Japan as an electronics technician with an aviation unit, and prior to deployment, my squadron received several hundred hours on Japanese history, culture and tradition, in addition to the requisite safety, security and terrorism briefs that occur when deploying to a foreign nation. The process was the same when I deployed to Saudi Arabia in 2000. As for the Mickey Mouse at the end, they were not being callous (as a group, individuals are another story), but the battle depicted in the movie was Hue (pronounced WHEY) City, and one of the bloodiest of the war, and were all trying to remember a happier, simpler time in their lives. I have been through the training that Joker, Cowboy, Sno-Ball and Gomer Pyle went through, and I would like to think that I became a better man because of it."
vancruejovi,"Mar 14, 2019",8/10,"Full Metal Jacket is a good war tale showing the psychological side of the marines and how it breaks men down into cold, numb killing machines or tearing them into insanity. Sending one of the characters to suicide and another to break his relationships off. It's a war film that shows the marines as human. It's not all about the battlefield, it's about the people under the helmets."
alexkolokotronis,"Jan 31, 2009",2/10,"Full Metal Jacket is considered by many to be a great movie. I am not one of those many. In fact I believe quite the opposite. I think this film is not only terrible but repulsive in countless ways. It attempts to show the horrors of war but does nothing but trivialize them. Also what exactly is the message of this movie? That war is bad? Well if thats what the message it certainly isn't something new. Of course then this movie has to make up in what lacks in an original message with some sort of creativity and stylistic features. In this way the film fails horribly.The acting of many of the relatively unknown actors is at best average. No actor stands out except for that of Vincent D'Onorfio who makes his exit less than half way through the film. The directing and writing of the film is absolutely horrible with the first half of the film used as a build up to a flat second half. Its almost as if the film is actually two separate ones: an average one and a disgraceful one. In the basic training sequences which takes up most of the first half of the film comes off as more hilarious then a brutal depiction of man being forcibly turned into machine. In the 2nd half of the film many of the sets made it too obvious that it was exactly that; a set. They were unconvincing with a lack of a realistic touch and screen shots out of a TV movie.As the movie wore on the lack of attention to detail became quite apparent leaving much to be desired. The ""tough"" characters came off as cheesy as everything seemed to just collapse within itself. The dialog in the movie felt useless and inconsistent with what was happening with in the film. By the end I didn't even care what was taking place. There were no character motivations and scenes became very predictable. Compared to the many classics made about Vietnam this one doesn't even come close."
bob the moo,"Oct 26, 2002",N/A,A bunch of young men join a marine training camp to prepare for war in Vietnam.  However before they can face the enemy they must make it past the rigours of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman.  Once past the training they face a war where many may not return alive.  They learn that the dehumanising effects of war run through every stage and are complete.This is Kubrick's most accessible film and I suspect that contributes to it's high rating on the imdb.  There can be no other reason why it would rank so high on it's own merits.  This is not to say it's a bad film but it is certainly not one of the best anti-war films ever made.  The plot is a game of two halves  first the training camp and second the actual conflict. The point that both halves hammer home relentlessly is that war dehumanises those involved.The first half is enjoyable pure and simply because of Emery's Gunnery Sergeant.  His is a witty character despite the inherent cruelty in his actions.  However eventually his screen time is ended and the film continues to make the same point over again but in a different setting.  The problem is that it hammers it's point home so heavily that it doesn't allow us to work things out for ourselves.  Even things like Platoon and the like allow us to work it out ourselves!  The film's strength is it's wonderful streak of black comedy that runs right the way through  it is the reason for watching and makes it feel a little different from other hardcore war movies of this ilk.Kubrick is always going to be watchable but this is not one of his best. His cold direction is usually excellent but here it is alienating and clinical when we should really be getting to like the soldiers involved. The film is still good but I felt that the flaws are too much here.  Emery is undoubtedly the main reason for watching this film.  He gives a great performance that is a mix of improvisation and script that works well and guaranteed him work in the same role for many years.  Modine is suitably wide eyed as our guide through his experiences but he is like most of the other marines  just blank characters for Kubrick to work around.  Only D'Onofrio (Pyle) came out of this as a real person.Overall this is a good anti-war film but not a great one.  There is no doubting the power of the message and Emery easily carries the film till the war itself.  It is still a very good film but I suspect that the fact that this is Kubrick's easiest film to get into explains why it is rated so highly.
Boba_Fett1138,"May 4, 2004",9/10,"Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R. Lee Ermey. The second half shows the madness of man in a war situation. Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie. Then the eternal question of which half is the better one? I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it. Kubrick also manages to put many other weird and unique situations in the movie, which makes this movie truly an unusual viewing experience that shall leave quite an impression on you. Only a brilliant man such as Stanley Kubrick can come up with these kind of scene's.Despite the oddness level of the movie, the movie still manages to also impress the more casual viewer. The battle sequences are made with lot's of profession and with some beautiful cinematography and great use of music.The characters are good and typical Kubrick like. Many of the actors give the performance of their lives. Especially Vincent D'Onofrio who gained a record breaking 70 pounds for his role.Not the best Vietnam movie but certainly the most unique one. You'll love it long time.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
mls4182,"Aug 1, 2022",10/10,"It is important for all of us to see what our troops have to go through on our behalf.Incredibly realistic. I almost fainted from the vulgarity and foul language.But seriously, I can't remember when a movie has made me cry like this one."
lee_eisenberg,"Mar 11, 2006",9/10,"After a several year absence, Stanley Kubrick returned to the screen with the hard-hitting ""Full Metal Jacket"", about an American platoon going to Vietnam. The movie wastes no time in getting down and dirty. Sgt. Hartman's (R. Lee Ermey) monologues haranguing the cadets are likely to knock the breath out of anyone. But that's only a preparation for what they experience once they reach Vietnam.If you've seen Kubrick's other movies, then you probably know that he pulls no punches. And believe you me, he doesn't here. We usually talk about the first and second parts of the movie, but one might say that even the second half has two halves: when they first arrive in Saigon (a safe, Americanized place), and when they actually go into battle (get ready for things to get ugly).All in all, maybe this isn't Kubrick's best movie, but definitely worth seeing. Matthew Modine is the nominal star, but there's also Adam Baldwin, Vincent D'Onofrio, Dorian Harewood, Arliss Howard, and some others. Just get ready to be blown away."
andreascaloni,"Apr 9, 2021",8/10,"Full Metal Jacket is well directed and boasts of a talented cast. The film has great moments but isn't always intriguing. After the awesome beginning, the middle part of the movie is slow and not gripping, the exciting moments return only near and at the end. Kubrick seems to want to tell us a story to show how the war affected the characters. He made it.Rating: 7,6."
Nevergivea10,"Apr 17, 2022",9/10,"Having personally survived Parris Island, I can assure you this is the only movie that comes close to portraying boot camp realistically. As far as the battle of Hue, from historic accounts that I have read, that too seems to accurate."
bloodystool-96877,"Sep 7, 2020",4/10,"The boot camp chunk of the film is pretty interesting and is without a doubt the best part of the film. I'm not saying it's perfect or fantastic by any means, but it's very memorable and engaging; cursed vibes all around. The rest of the movie doesn't need to exist, it feels like filler and really not much else. It is absurdly boring as well as forgettable. I think this movie would've been better off as a short film. Leave the boot camp parts and chop the rest off."

Not the best from Kubrick, but works great as a war film. The plot is about a group of soldiers who are turned into killers in marine training, and are then sent off to the Vietnam War.Kubrick once again does a great job at directing. Modine, D'Onofrio, Baldwin, and Howard give worthy performances, while Ermey gives an Oscar worthy (not even nominated) performance and steals the show. This is a very realistic look at Vietnam, while the battle scenes and script just aren't as satisfying as they are in the second half. Still, it is a wonderful film.9/10."
helpless_dancer,"Apr 13, 1999",8/10,"Some of the most realistic looking boot camp scenes I've ever seen. The sarge was a vile, filthy mouthed individual; glad I never joined the corps. After going through all the boot camp crap, a group of fresh new jarheads go off to the jungle in Viet Nam to put their lessons in war to good use. Realistic acting made me feel that I was watching a real war. It showed all the grimy brutality, waste, boredom, and horror of what war really is. Forget all the Rambo stuff; if you want to see the genuine article, see ""Full Metal Jacket"". Killer film."
armandova28,"Jan 10, 2025",9/10,"""This movie is beautiful"" was the first thought I had upon finishing it. Without a doubt, it is a work of art that transcends the blood, the dead, and the drama. In my opinion, it perfectly portrays people and their psyche, paying close attention to the small details in the emotional development of all the characters and creating a clear distinction between the front lines and the rear. While the soldiers in the rear ""die of boredom,"" the soldiers on the front lines die day by day, fighting without even knowing what they are fighting for. Everything in this movie screams masterpiece, and I personally strongly recommend that everyone who watches it turn off the lights, lie back, and prepare to feel the harsh reality of war."
tiagocampos-02918,"Jul 3, 2020",8/10,"I think almost everybody agrees on something here: this movie is divided into 2 parts: the R. Lee Ermey part and the rest! I've always found it incredible that one of the best performances I've ever seen was from a guy who was not an actor and had no experience as one. The man outshines the rest of the movie so much that if you try to explain to people that this is the one where ""that sergeant is always screaming during bootcamp"" they will immediately understand what you're talking about if they have seen it in the past. It is a memorable picture and the second half is nonetheless impactful too!"

wrpgxvzp,"Sep 3, 2021",9/10,"The feel i got from the movie is what i suppose what was intended? We are being pushed this subject of difference in people and how we portray ourselves while meaning one thing and saying another. That is what this movie felt like to me. It was a war movie yes, but it's also a sort of paychological dive into soldiers and training to become a soldier."
htech,"Feb 4, 1999",7/10,"The consensus seems to be that this film is two separate dramas, and that is an accurate assessment.  Kubrick, as always, shows the audience events and then allows them their own conclusions (sort of like real life, huh?)I served in the Army and like most veterans, the boot camp sequence (the first film) is funny, scary, informative and exhausting, just like basic training.  When the story shifts to Vietnam, it loses a little of its appeal and originality, but it is effective in showing the utter uselessness of war, especially the disjointed, aimless jaunt that existed in Southeast Asia.I'm not so sure this is the best war film ever made, or even the best film about Vietnam.  The film is thought provoking, though, and very well acted. Why isn't Matthew Modine more highly regarded?  His performance here is very good, and with his roles in Birdy and And The Band Played On, he seems to be one of the best actors in the 25 to 40 range.I do like this film, and I think it is another example of Stanley Kubrick's brilliance, but I can't say that it's great.But, to his credit, a Kubrick film is just like a military experience. You've never seen anything quite like it before, and you'll never come across anything like it again."
mcjensen-05924,"Aug 6, 2021",2/10,"Kubrik has assembled the worst cast and put to film the most laughable/unrealistic movie about any was in the history of war movies. The boot camp scenes at the beginning, while overdone to the extreme, were riveting and worthwhile watching. Especially for Vincent D.'s performance. He seems to be the only character given any consideration about character development. He was superb, and should have been around for the duration of the movie. At least he finally got that sergeant to stop yelling. But in retrospect I'm sure he's glad he wasn't associated with the ""in country"" part of this disasterpiece. The negative reviews are right on the money, but there's really no way to prepare the viewer for just how simple minded it really is. The sets were quite ridiculous and unconvincing, and the acting is some of the worst you will ever see bar none. I don't like movies where the director is so obviously manipulating the viewer into how to feel, and that's all this was. War bad. Well everyone can agree on that so why not just make a realistic movie? The soldiers were given the most idiotic, cliched heroic lines that fell flat repeatedly. I laughed at the big final battle scene it was so awful. It must be nice to blatantly and repeatedly defy direct orders from a superior officer. Apparently nobody got the memo that Cease Fire means Stop Shooting. I know it's confusing. Scenes were long and drawn out for no purpose excetp to maybe give you time to get to the fridge for a beer or better yet something to perk you up. There's nobody to like, nobody to cheer for, and ultimately no point to this film whatsoever. Terrible portrayal of a horrendous time and it deserved a more dignified treatment than this travesty. No deep underlying message, no morality lesson to speak of. Just a film showcasing the worst Hollywood could offer. A few good songs get a star and Vincent gets a star. 8.3 is quite the bloated average for such a dismal pot of rancid stew."
gut-6,"Jul 5, 2004",N/A,"This superb film was a big improvement on Kubrick's previous film, The Shining. It is a far more confronting spectacle than the poetic, stylised violence of A Clockwork Orange, despite the latter's notoriety. The brutality of FMJ is unceasing.While the war scenes may seem pointless and directionless, this film more than any other war film I have seen captures the small-scale and scrappy nature of urban warfare. There is no grand narrative from the point of view of the individual unit or the individual soldier - just lots of snipers and corpses and skirmishes over ruined buildings. These individual skirmishes have no obvious strategic value and no obvious relationship to one another or to the world war against communist imperialism. They may be fighting for freedom, but the soldiers are motivated by other things - camaraderie, macho posturing and the urge to kill instilled in them at boot camp.I cannot understand those who criticise this Kubrick film above others for consisting of multiple episodes with very different feel and setting. It appears such people have never seen Kubrick's other films, such as 2001: A Space Odyssey or A Clockwork Orange or Barry Lyndon or Paths of Glory or Lolita. Indeed, 2001: A Space Odyssey is even more disjointed than FMJ, not even having common characters between the segments. The films are no less brilliant for it. This is a consequence of the way that Kubrick worked, as revealed in ""Stanley Kubrick: A Life in Pictures"" and Fred Raphael's admittedly unreliable ""Eyes Wide Open"". In Kubrick's view a movie was ready to be made when he had 7 or 8 episodes to string together. Often you can see the joins. Kubrick's legendary perfectionism arose from the fact that he didn't know what he wanted, only what he didn't want. Hence the voluminous research, the continuous script rewrites, the endless prop redesigns, the dozens of takes (all for petty and arbitrary reasons if he gave reasons at all) until by chance someone came up with a great idea. Only then would he move on. All this is why the greatness of Kubrick's films lies in the sum of the brilliant parts rather than the whole.FMJ fits right in to Kubrick's oeuvre. There is the ongoing theme of dehumanisation, the cynical world view, the hilarious black humour, the cold, distant and unsympathetic characters, the key use of pre-existing music, and the central role of war and conflict. Yet again, and very much like Werner Herzog he makes the surreal seem utterly believable, and reality seem surreal.For those who say there are better anti-war films, Kubrick said himself he was making a war film, not an anti-war film. He was trying to show the full picture, and leaving it to the audience to judge. The dehumanisation and brutality of boot camp, the moral ambiguity of the war and the vanity, crassness & questionable mental stability of some of the American soldiers is shown unsparingly, but so is the uncompromising barbarity of the communist enemy. You understand why the soldiers need the dehumanising training they are given. Animal Mother may indeed be an Animal Mother, but when it comes to the crunch he is clear-headed, effective and fiercely loyal to his comrades, and even musters a grudging sympathy for the dying sniper in acceding to Joker's humane despatching of her.All in all, an unforgettable film, totally different in feel to any other war movie I have seen. There is no glorification, no demonisation, and no redemption, but also no simplistic pacifist platitudes and despite everything, great beauty in the hellish ruins."
leopard-59572,"Jan 4, 2020",10/10,"Are the words to the opening song and from this moment, this movie grabs you and doesn't let go. It's crazy that Platoon got all the praise, Platoon is brilliant but not close to as good as this one. Kubrick is amazing most of the time and he doesn't let himself down with this one. The atmosphere it creates in certain sequences is unreal, in the scene with the woman sniper the background sound is amazing, it seems to be a certain kind of reasonance that just pulls you into the tv and of course we have the forever and still to be equalled drill instructor section, this movie never gets old and never gets boring. Another Kubrick masterpiece."
drqshadow-reviews,"Mar 9, 2025",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick shows us the complete Vietnam War experience, with all its dark and dirty depths. Like he did with 2001: A Space Odyssey, Kubrick essentially splits Full Metal Jacket into two standalone films. Here, they're distinguished by setting: basic training or the front lines. At the exhaustively disciplined South Carolina academy, troops quickly learn to suppress their emotions and gobble down the s##t sandwiches they're offered. In the field, those rations are tripled. From the moment they sign on the line and sit down for a buzz in the barber's chair, these soldiers are ambushed virtually every day. Whether it's a mouthy drill sergeant with a hard-on for punishment or the scarcely-seen Viet Cong guerrillas who lace crumbling cities with snipers and IEDs, each morning greets them with a fresh set of lethal tripwires and invisible calamities. As the adage says, war is hell, but that doesn't exclusively apply to the overseas field of battle.Most of Full Metal Jacket's best lines and memorable moments occur in its first half, when R. Lee Ermey marches purposefully through the frame and into our collective faces. As the truculent drill sergeant tasked with hardening this class of nervous puppies into a company of brutal killing machines, Ermey takes great pride in undressing the unprepared and stomping feelings until they're flat. That he does so with a flair for wit and a vulgar, potent sense of humor makes him spellbinding, if not appealing. As he squashes any trace of individuality, we guffaw. As he turns the company's rage upon itself, we widen our eyes and hold our breath. As he exploits one particular omega type beyond the limits of mental endurance, we dread the explosion. And we still aren't prepared for the shape that takes. Vincent D'Onofrio burst onto the global scene in this role; the slow and delicate doughboy who's singled out as carrion by a predator who likes to play with his food. D'Onofrio's agonized misunderstanding is crushing, and the evidence of his snapping point chilled me to the bone. He's fantastic, both the film's beating heart and its blood-stained teeth.Which is not to discount the profundity of the second half, which depicts a far looser (and more precarious) life inside a ravaged combat zone. Here, the troops compartmentalize their anxiety, masking a fear of instant, random death with steady doses of machismo and gallows humor. The disposability of human life is emphasized, again and again. The men's mutual senses of loneliness, hopelessness, exhaustion and frustration manifest in many different ways. That is, until the platoon comes under fire and, all of a sudden, their training kicks in and they mindlessly get busy like automatons. This system was built to churn out broken, depraved lunatics and then dump them, with little support, in a far-off land to spray agony upon their surroundings. No shock that collateral damage would be considered an acceptable side-effect.This is a hard, mean, dark film. There is some hope in Full Metal Jacket, but it's short-lived and duly punished. It shows us the proverbial flower, blooming through a crack in the sidewalk, then yanks it up by its roots and throws it into the fire. It has antithetical beauty, depicting a bleak and unhappy message in a way that's brisk, lively and funny. Often riotously so. And, typical of a Kubrick film (as he was notorious about re-trying takes until everything was perfect), it's adorned with countless career-making performances. Surely one of the most stirring war movies ever made, even if it doesn't flaunt a truth most of us would like to hear. These guys were shell-shocked before they even touched a rifle."
dflynch215,"Jun 25, 2020",9/10,"As an Army vet who endured basic training in 1969, I appreciated Full Metal Jacket's brutally accurate depiction of Marine Corps boot camp (Army guys don't sleep with their rifles). Most of our instructors weren't much older than the trainees, however, R. Lee Ermey was over 40 when the film was made. We had trainees go crazy and go AWOL. We had an attempted suicide. The brilliance of Full Metal Jacket is how it suddenly leaps from the stark reality of Parris Island to the nebulousness and indecisiveness of American presence in southeast Asia. Some viewers don't seem to grasp the significance of the film's second half. The confusion and lack of intendment are symbolic of America's befuddlement concerning the Vietnam experience."
Uriah43,"Mar 27, 2025",8/10,"This film begins in the early 1960s with a Marine Corps draftee named ""James T. Davis"" (Matthew Modine) reporting for duty at Parris Island, South Carolina, to commence basic combat training. With him is a particularly slow individual named ""Leonard Lawrence"" (Vincent D'Onofrio), who constantly gets the entire platoon into trouble due to his inability to follow the commands of his drill instructor, ""Gunnery Sergeant Hartman"" (R. Lee Ermey). This prompts the platoon to confront him physically one night, underscoring the seriousness of the situation for everyone involved. It works, and he immediately adopts a more serious attitude. What nobody realizes, however, is that Private Lawrence is now mentally unstable, and this will eventually lead to severe repercussions for the entire platoon. Now, instead of revealing more, I will note that this film is one of the better portrayals of the Vietnam War, as it shows the human carnage up close and personal. There are, however, a couple of minor flaws that most people who have never served in the military may not notice. For instance, in a specific scene, Sergeant Davis is questioned by a Marine Corps colonel about a peace symbol he wears on his uniform. The issue is that such a conversation would likely never occur, as no field-grade officer would attempt to reason with anyone regarding a uniform violation; they would simply order him to remove it. To be sure, the rules regarding the wearing of the uniform were quite relaxed during this particular time and place, and it is entirely possible that something like this would go unchallenged. However, if it were challenged by such a high-level officer, no philosophical discussions would be involved. That aside, I thought this was an excellent film about the Vietnam War, and I have rated it accordingly."
paul-87,"Sep 9, 1998",9/10,This is possibly the greatest war movie ever made. I have seen Platoon but I do not think it is quite as moving. This movie contains a lot of adult language but the story in this makes up for it totally. I have seen many of Stanley Kubrick's works but this one is truly my definite favorite.
Theo Robertson,"Sep 1, 2002",7/10,"FULL METAL JACKET has one of the most bizarre structures in film history. The first half of FMJ is rightly regarded as being one of the great segments of cinema . Kubrick/Herr/Hasford`s razor sharp script takes us on a blackly comical tour of the horrors of basic training with Sergeant Hartman , private Joker and Leonard Lawrence being the central characters , but then the film cuts to the battlefields of `Nam with only a couple of characters like Joker and Cowboy linking the two segments . Also disappearing is much of the first half`s wit with only the irony of American firepower bringing down tower blocks in retaliation to a sniper being the only real clever and knowing aspect to the script . It`s confusing too because with the exception of Joker and co. the rest of the film doesn`t really tie in with the basic training segment , perhaps the film would have worked a lot better if the entire film was taken up with the basic training ? And I can`t help noticing that much of the terrain doesn`t really resemble the jungles of South East Asia , as everyone knows FMJ was filmed in and around London and it often shows. Still it`s a film worth watching if only for the basic training scenes which are certainly more convincing than those seen in HEARTBREAK RIDGE . A couple of questions though ...If there`s any former USMC men out there could you write in and tell us how realistic the training scenes are ?I used to be in the army myself ( Royal Engineers ) but we never EVER called instructors "" Sir "" . In fact if someone in the British army made that mistake they`d receive the reply "" Don`t f****** call me sir . I work for a living "" along with a few other choice insults .  Is it a common practice for American recruits to call their instructors "" Sir "" ?"
freethinkingworld,"Dec 15, 2022",8/10,"So I have finally found a Stanly Kubrick Film I like and have not had to rewatch it a bunch before I end up liking it! I doubt after finishing a full watch through of his films that this will be my favorite, but it was really good and definitely deserves the reputation of must watch for war films and just in general. I do think the view that the first half is stronger than the second half is true. But both parts of the movie are well done and brilliantly acted. Obviously the performance of R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio were the highlight of this movie. But I found every performance solid and well done."
Robert-53,"Oct 31, 1998",6/10,"This is really one of the most disjointed films ever made--the first half of the men going thru the Marine Boot Camp is truly the finest depiction ever made--the drill sgt. used to be a real one which really adds the authenticity. But when the movie shifts to Viet Nam, the whole movie falls flat--the whole audience is bored listless wondering what the point is. A few vague references to ""the duality of man"" are made but never explored, the characters are shallow and cardboard. The movie was taken from a short story, ""The Short Timers"", but if that story had a message it's completely lost in the movie. In short, see the first half which will hit you like a ton of bricks, then get ready to read the paper or just skip the whole 2nd half entirely."
Michael_Elliott,"Aug 30, 2010",N/A,"Full Metal Jacket (1987)*** 1/2 (out of 4)Stanley Kubrick's film follows a Marine (Matthew Modine) from his basic training with a brutal Sny. Sgt. (R. Lee Ermey) to a final showdown in Vietnam where a group of soldiers are being picked off by a sniper.Kubrick's return to the cinema after a seven year break came with a film genre that has pretty much played itself out in the past eight or nine years considering we got films like THE DEER HUNTER, COMING HOME, APOCALYPSE NOW as well as PLATOON. Many critics panned the film for being too familiar while others called it a masterpiece that showed the war unlike any movie before. I've always had a love-hate relationship with FULL METAL JACKET and it's probably a film I've seen more than any other Kubrick even though I think it's one of the director's lesser films. There's no question that the first hour is a masterpiece but I've never warmed up to the second half for several reasons but as any Kubrick fan knows, the more you watch his films the more you notice different things.This latest viewing of the film had me enjoying the second half of the picture a lot more than any previous time. I think one reason was that I got to see it theatrically on a very large screen and it brought out certain elements that I had never really picked up on before including the incredible cinematography. The camera-work has always been a strong point to every Kubrick film and I really loved the way that the camera pretty much just floats around during the second half picking up the action as it moves along. This really gives the viewer a first-hand look at everything that's going on and it really does put you in the middle of the action and this is especially true during the final portion where the marines are going up against a sniper.I still have some problems with this sequence including the interviews that are done by the film crew. I can understand why Kubrick would include these scenes but to me they really don't add enough to warrant their inclusion in the film but who knows... Perhaps my next viewing I'll see them in a different manor.The first half of the film is probably the most unoriginal as the training camp sequence has been seen in dozens of films going all the way back to the silent era yet Kubrick shows it in a way that makes it an unnerving thrill that will wreck each of your emotions. Kubrick paints some very dark humor in the film and most of it at the expense of Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), an overweight idiot who gets tortured not only by the drill Sergent but also the men in his group. I've always seen the first half of the film as a portrait of how much a man can take before finally cracking up. The picture shown here certainly needs to give credit to D'Onofrio but the main credit goes to Kubrick and that amazing vision.The way the camera glides around much like it did in THE SHINING brings the same claustrophobic sense of dread and one can't help but get caught up in the story. This portion of the film has some very funny moments but it's also incredibly disturbing simply because of the abuse Pyle takes and you can't help but feel sorry for him but at the same time you too want to hate him because of how stupid he is. The scenes are quite shocking in a way because of how raw Kubrick makes them and its this rawness that really makes this stuff seem fresh even though we've seen it before. Kubrick was a master with the camera and it's just amazing to see how quickly our emotions can change as one second we'll be laughing only to have that quickly go away as something darker happens.This first hour can easily be called a masterpiece because of how raw and powerful it is and in the end there's really not another basic training sequence that can compare. The second half has certainly grown on me with this latest viewing but I still think there are just a few too many flaws here for me to call the film a masterpiece or even a great movie. With that said, for countless viewings I said the same thing about THE SHINING but now that's on my list as one of the greatest movies ever made."
AlexMedario,"Apr 7, 2020",9/10,"Sorry that I cannot include the whole sentence, that summarizes very well the bottom line of the movie. This movie is full of memorable sentences, so is that that I remember a few of them even now after so many years. I watched the movie first time when it was released and a couple of times recently. It has aged very well, I'm glad of having watched it again and my high opinon about the film remains the same."
FromRiches2Rags,"Mar 19, 2025",10/10,"I was in my teens when I first watched this. Like most films from the 80s and 90s I thought it would be unwatchable now that I'm in my late 40's.However that is not the case. This and The Shining are the only Kubrick films I've seen as I could not watch his other popular films for various reasons.Stanley Kubrick manages to make the viewer feel the pain of certain characters in a situation that they did not want to be in up to the point when the soul of that person leaves their body.No other movie comes close to the way that Kubrick achieved this. Add the political message that this film oozes and you have one of the best war films ever made.Platoon and Apocalypse Now are not on the same level as this. I cannot watch them again despite watching them multiple times in the early nineties.There is something beyond the limits of time constraints that this film surpasses. I appreciate Stanley Kubricks message. I wish he did one on Iraq, who knows he may have done had he been alive.Looks like he tried to expose a lot more with Eyes Wide Shut so he was unalived and his vision for that film was butchered. Haven't seem it nor would I want to watch his cut either but look at the Hollyweird situation today and you will realise what Mr Kubrick tried to do regardless of the majority voice without a moral compass stating otherwise."
mdf-87936,"May 30, 2022",8/10,"I absolutely love the first half of FMJ. R Lee Ermey knocks it out of the park. His performance is both hilarious and terrifying. At first you wonder how he could be so cruel, yet slowly understand why he is doing what he's doing. He goes from calling the recruits ""worthless"" to ""maggots"" to finally ""Marines"". He sees their growth and that's why he was so strict. I've heard that many DI's during Vietnam would check the daily death notices to see if anyone they trained was killed. I can only imagine that Hartman would do this as well and his heart would sink had he recognized any of the names.As for the second half of the movie...meh, it's OK. It is no where near as memorable as the beginning. Everyone I know who has seen it can quote the basic training scenes almost word for word. The Vietnam scenes kinda go by the wayside."
Hidden,"Oct 13, 1998",10/10,bets movie ever made and if you don't think so i'll test you to see if you are a v.c.
ronbell-23984,"Feb 12, 2021",6/10,"The first half of the movie was excellent throughout the soldiers training, culminating in the drill Sergeant getting shot / private pile suicide scene. After that when the troops were in Vietnam it got boring. Yes it's a movie about war which is a serious subject but I switched off as I lost interest. Could have been brilliant after such a great first half."
endoflongshot,"Jun 23, 2005",10/10,"A very disturbing film about the Vietnam War, much darker than any of Kubrick's other films. The Music stands out as a major contributer to the film's mentality. Kubrick likes to use music of the time his films takes place, and it made perfect sense for Full Metal. The film really gets into the minds of the soldiers. What Apocalypse Now was for the Air Cav, this movie is for the Marines in Vietnam. The film's major point is the Duality of Men, and the beauty of Kubrick's shots helps instill a feeling of Victory even though all you see in the film is defeat. This is the most beautifully shot war film I've ever seen, even better than Terry Malick's Thin Red Line. Shots are crisp, perfect, colorful and each scene has its own embrace and feeling, paired wonderfully with the music. All in all, a beautiful war film that delves deep into the psyche of a solider in the Vietnam era. The perfect blend of Tragedy and Energy. the perfection of Stanley Kubrick."
jyanagi,"Aug 18, 2002",2/10,"This movie has always been a real disappointment for me.  While its portrayal of the Marine training sequence is powerful and memorable, Kubrick continues to do a less-than inspiring portrayal of combat in Vietnam. Approaching the diaspora from a different angle than Stone, Kubrick hits upon some of the classic themes left (appropriately) untouched by Platoon. Yet, in some cases the ubiquitous slow-motion violence is needlessly gratuitous and the round-the-body one liner reflections and face-the-camera montage interviews are cheesy, if not reminiscent of other great 'camera-focused' escapades like Kevin Pollak's ""Opposite Sex"" and the recent ""that 70s show"".Pop music is played too often as if FMJ begins to lean towards a self-indulgent glorification of the 60s, even in inappropriate and distracting places.  Who can forget Joker and his colleagues (the few bright spots of the film: character development), but the movie fails to depict the subject matter in a realistic or subdued matter when needed.It seems as if to Kubrick, Vietnam is not a war where Americans were forever traumatized, but rather just another stage for pop culture to spotlight the trite 'duality of man' in an 'animal setting'.  I hated the movie.  This movie does little justice to the memory of those who were in Vietnam.  The movie immediately strays and wavers, becoming an uncomfortable hybrid between 'popular nostalgic war formula' and 'psychological thriller' and proceeds to do both very poorly."
austin0731,"Jun 8, 2019",8/10,"Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is celebrated as one of the best depictions of the Vietnam War and perfectly captures the dehumanizing process of war. The movie is essentially split up into two halves, the first half set in a bootcamp and depicting the main characters being humiliated and hardened into killing machines for the US marines. While the second half focuses on the soldiers after they have been deployed in VIetnam and now the war has a dehumanizing effect on the soldiers.The performances are great, from Vincent D'Onofrio's pvt. Pyle to R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to Matthew Modine as Pvt. Joker, all of whom delivered stellar performances that indicate the great machine that is the military boot camp system and war as a whole, its effects on the human psyche.Over the years there has been countless analysis and breakdowns of Full Metal Jacket, its themes and what it all means. I think that just goes to show the brilliance of Kubrick, to him it isn't about giving audiences a question and an answer but to present us with a rhetorical question that we can sit with and discuss amongst each other. I really enjoy the ambiguity of each key scene yet it is presented in such a way that as an audience you wouldn't just take for what it is, there is a sense that everything means more than face value and thus, is the beauty of Full Metal Jacket."
DontReedIntoIt,"Jun 20, 2021",8/10,"As someone who was born in the late 90s, I wasn't privy to what life was like during the vietnam war but just hear brief anecdotes it's seems like while most average individuals were openly against the war, big corp., industry and government kept silent. So being able to look back and place a film that openly went against the big gov. Agenda is awesome! I hope more writers, directors, producers and creators alike take notes and remember that values DO have a place in art and media. Great work, thoroughly enjoyed the mix of comedy and darkness that came with this piece. Kind of felt like 2 different movies but one in the same simultaneously? Don't know what to make of that but I definitely enjoyed watching!"
GOWBTW,"Jun 10, 2006",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick has put up another fine masterpiece about the USMC getting reading for the Vietnam War. ""Full Metal Jacket"" shows how Marine life is not child's play, and the Drill Seargant from Hell(R. Lee Ermey, aka ""The Gunny"") really performed well in this movie. It is set in Parris Island, S.C., were the main Corp was locate to whip these civilians into shape. Gunnery Sgt. Hartman(Ermey) is one heck of a bad-a$$ Drill Sgt. who takes no crap from anyone. He didn't discriminate anyone, he treated everyone like an equal. However, he tortured Pvt. Pyle(Vincent D'Onofrio) so bad, he went over the edge after the training. He marched with his pants down, sucked on his thumb like a little boy, and had to endure a very brutal beating from the other Privates. Socking a drill Sergeant will call for a discharge or time in confinement, shooting him will result in court martial, and a dishonorable discharge. Of course, Pyle discharged himself with the same gun. The other went on and the brutal battle is ensured. The Marines don't play around, and they really show the sign of brotherhood of the Corp. The chants the Gunny made was a classic. ""This is my rifle, this is my gun..."" is the one song I think should be shared to only the military. It's always lock and load. This movie is a must for all members of the USMC. Whether they are recruits or vets, I this this movie a major SEMPER FI! CARRY ON! 5 STARS, OORAH!"
FredTipp,"Feb 4, 2021",7/10,"I use to love this movie but after a watched it again on TV last night (for the first time in 20 something years) I realized that time has not been kind to it. (As it seem to happen to a lot of Kubricks movies).First half with the boot camp, drill Sargent Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and arrival in Vietnam is still great, but as soon as they hit battle it all becomes just embarrassing and disappointing display of mediocre acting and strange directing. No realism at all from a military point of view, not even a little. And the soldiers behavior in battle are completely unreal, all the time.Poor acting or poor directing? Maybe a little bit of both. Kubrick was clearly looking for something else than realism when he made those city battle scenes, but whatever it was he though he caught (and brought) to the silver screen it's all gone now. Well, except for the score (not soundtrack) that is still top notch. Still, I'm lowering my grade to 7.There are a bunch of way better (even older) movies to watch that explores the Vietnam war tougher, rougher and definitely more realistic."
UniqueParticle,"May 31, 2019",10/10,"Shockingly intense especially the first half! I'm sure Vincent D'Onfrio struggled to maintain sanity during filming being how authentic everything was, and R. Lee Emery was so menacing! The second half is outstanding war perfection with an excellent soundtrack to go with it. I'm usually barely a fan of war films but this is among the best."
MovieAddict2016,"Feb 6, 2004",7/10,"Often referred to as one of his lesser great works, Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" is an assortment of various ideas that never really come together in perfect harmony. It's an anti-war film, a war film, a film about Military training, a film about Military combat, and a film about soldiers all packed into one little bundle. It's overstuffed, too full to carry all of its own weight, and it's got nowhere to dump the excess cargo but on its viewers.One of the film's characters, ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine), wears a peace necklace around his throat and a helmet with the words ""Born To Kill"" scribbled in the center throughout the film. ""Whose side are you on?"" someone asks him. He's not sure, and either is the film--which is one of its considerable flaws.The biggest flaw is its cold manner. This isn't a bad film, and far from it, but when compared to a Vietnam film such as ""Platoon,"" it seems rather weak in many comparable ways. But, as I noted in a paragraph above, the worst thing about ""Full Metal Jacket"" is the humanity of the story. It has virtually none whatsoever.This isn't particularly surprising, since Kubrick has often been famous for his cold style of filmmaking (""2001,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""Eyes Wide Shut""). Don't misunderstand what I'm saying--Kubrick may very well by an amazing director. But a war film is different from one about art and deep meanings--you have to introduce characters, get the audience to like them, have them suffer personal trials and tribulations, and have some emotional moments in the film. Kubrick fails at this on the same level that Stone succeeded, even though they're both trying to get across the same messages. (It doesn't help that ""Full Metal Jacket"" was released a year after ""Platoon,"" which makes it look like a pale imitator in comparison.)All of the characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem very written, which basically just means they're words and motions on paper, acted out by individuals in Army suits. Of course, from a literal viewpoint, this is correct--but it's hard to doubt the realistic nature of a film when we are fully convinced that what we are witnessing is true. These characters in ""Full Metal Jacket"" seem hardly likable, and they are very rarely put through any type of emotional anguish, which is the key to all great war films--even ""Forrest Gump"" had some.I enjoyed the first half of the movie, which is basically the training period. We see a group of soldiers being prepared for conflict outside their barracks by a nasty Drill Sergeant (R. Lee Ermy). One of the kids in the group, Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), is a bit of a dummy--and the drill sergeant takes out all his anger and fury upon the kid. After weeks of training, Lawrence finally snaps in half and shoots the drill sergeant, then himself, leaving Joker as the sole witness.This is where the first half of the film essentially ends and the second half begins, which is all boring combat. This is where I started to grow weary of the film's heavy-handed anti-war protest and ineffective characters. There was at least some type of subtle setup for the Lawrence character, but all the other characters are just wandering clichés.This may sound like an ignorant thing to say, but it's not. I enjoyed ""Full Metal Jacket"" to a certain extent. I just can't find it anywhere within me to call this a great film, nor a perfect one. It has many flaws, most of which result from poorly introduced characters and unattached emotions. There are also flaws from a technical viewpoint, such as the voice-over narrative by Modine. It's like screenwriting guru Brian McKee advises students--don't use voice-over unless it's essential to the story. Any idiot can express characters' emotions with their own words.Voice-over was essential in ""Apocalypse Now"" and ""Platoon,"" but not here. It only occurs three or four times throughout the film and only halts the progression of the story. It's sloppy, pointless, and Modine's voice provides almost nothing to the story. Some people may disagree with me, but why have a character (in this case Modine) tell us where he's heading to instead of just putting subtitles in grainy Courier font? By introducing the audience to this voice-over, Kubrick does nothing but take the easy route towards scene explanations. Especially considering this voice-over is only used a handful of times for a few seconds each time.Regardless of technical flaws or figurative flaws, ""Full Metal Jacket"" fails where most war films succeed. Whether you agree with the message or not, Stone knew how to deliver the anti-war message within ""Platoon"" with deadly accuracy and subtlety. There's no subtlety here--Kubrick makes his echoing statement clear from the beginning on. And whether you personally like him or not, Stone also convincingly portray Vietnam. Even DePalma did a fine job of this in ""Casualties of War."" ""Full Metal Jacket"" isn't quite as convincing. Everything's heavy-handed. Everything feels fake. Everything feels contrived. It gets boring very quickly, and feels like an imitator of all the other Vietnam films. And the fact that it was released a year after ""Platoon"" seems to suggest that Kubrick may have indeed been borrowing a few ideas from Stone.There's a reason the die-hard Kubrick fans consider this one of his lesser works, and there's a reason you don't hear it mentioned very much when war films are discussed. In conclusion, it's just a copycat of many various films, with a dozen or so different ideas that never mix together very successfully.This is a good war film, but I can't say it's anything more than that.4/5."
dierregi,"Oct 8, 2012",4/10,"It should be widely known that Kubrick movies are not to be enjoyed, but endured. As a ""cinephile"" my choice was to endure them only once, just to know what one of the most overrated directors in the history of cinema was up to. I duly watched FMJ at the time of its original release and did not enjoy it. Back then it felt like a late arrival, saying nothing new after Apocalypse Now and Platoon. Devoid of the emotional impact of those two other movies, dry, slow-paced and boring.Last night, I stumbled upon it on TV and out of curiosity I decided to give it another try, should my previous impression been marred by youthful ignorance. Alas not... In fact, years of movie-watching just enhanced my dislike for what looks more than ever like an half-baked, over simplistic war movie.As everybody knows, FMJ is basically two movies stuck together, with little relation to each other. The first half takes place during a brutal boot camp, with lots of shouting and humiliation from a sadist drill sergeant, leading to ""tragic events"" of some sort. The second half takes place in Great Britain, standing for Vietnam and failing miserably at the task.In no way the cold, gray UK could be mistaken for a sub-tropical country. In FMJ the actors keep their long sleeves down, no sticky heat, profuse sweating or ventilators flapping.Besides being infamous for its fake, chilling location, the second part is almost ludicrous in every other aspect. From the dialogs, which sound like a parody of macho war movies, but are in no way funny, to character non-development, to sexist use of local prostitutes - not once, but twice.We are shown twice what is basically the same scene (and the only female presence in the movie): a young Viet prostitute soliciting Joker and friends. Same scene some 15 minutes later, only this time the prostitute is pimped out by a local guy.I could ask many questions about this movie For instance if Kubrick was supposed to be over-meticulous and detail crazy how did he missed the fact that the UK does not look like Vietnam? How did he missed the fact that he had the same scene twice? etc...In the poster's photo we have a helmet with ""Born to kill"" scribbled next to a peace sign, signifying the duplicity of human nature. This convey the full message you should get at the end of the movie, so you can spare yourself some time just taking a good look at the poster. If you want to add an additional layer of ""meaning"", perhaps you can infer that mankind (in the shape of main character Joker) is ""naturally"" good but can be trained to become ""bad"". Hardly a brand-new, mind-blowing concept."
michaelRokeefe,"Aug 9, 2000",8/10,"This is Stanley Kubrick's vivid and harsh portrait of the Viet Nam War, as seen through the eyes of soldiers, trained to change their attitudes and twist their moral fibers in reluctantly fighting a complex war. Basic training to the battlefield, your only choices are survive or die trying. This movie's realism rivals that of PLATOON.Outstanding cast includes Matthew Modine, R. Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Onofrio, Arliss Howard, Ed O'Ross, Adam Baldwin and Kevyn Major Howard.This movie can be very riveting and agonizing; but for sure, it is one you will have trouble forgetting."
ShuangKate,"Jan 11, 2025",10/10,"I was blown away by this film, both visually and aurally. I swear I've never heard so many dirty words in my life. And I've never watched a war movie that uses rock and roll music as its soundtrack, as this one does. And I love all the soundtracks.I found it very wired the first time I saw it, but I began to find it so intriguing the second time that I watched it several times. The first half is incredibly phenomenal! So many scenes are iconic! And the second half affords much food for thought. Whether it's the fact that the Joker wears a peace button on his uniform and writes ""Born to kill"" on his helmet, believing that men are of duality, or that the banner reads ""First to go, last to know. We will defend to the death your right to be misinformed"", this half has a sobering taste of irony. Of course, the whole film is full of irony and elements of brainwashing. I think Kubrick was suggesting that the Big tried to convince the public of what it wanted them to believe, by trickery or swindle. Wars dehumanize people and plunge them into a world of h**l.By the way, many of the shots in this film are beautifully photographed. And the final scene is equally impressive."
Benjamin-M-Weilert,"Dec 16, 2022",8/10,"As a self-proclaimed film buff, I have to admit that it's almost criminal that I've gone this long without fully watching Full Metal Jacket (1987). After all, I have seen most of Stanley Kubrick's filmography and I understand the importance of his oeuvre. I think my hesitation is that I've already seen most of this film just through the memes that it eventually spawned. That, and doing more of a ""straight"" take on a war movie after the perfect satire that is Dr. Strangelove (1964) felt like a disservice.Even though this movie is almost three hours long, it really feels like two completely separate films smashed together. I don't believe any other film before or since has quite captured that ""boot camp"" feel that the first half of this movie does. It's spawned so many quotable lines that it stands on its own without a need to follow up. Then we jump into war and it feels a bit more generic-even if it still contains a few memorable lines as well. By 1987, it felt like we already had plenty of these kinds of war movies that show how all the training goes out the window once you get into the field.The one thing that definitely redeems the second half (and enforces the whole movie, to be honest) is the subtle way that Kubrick shows mastery of cinematography. It doesn't bring attention to itself, but the little things stand out as different. Like how everything at boot camp is in focus, highlighting how no soldier is special or deserving of specialized attention. Or how a long one-shot introduces so much exposition about fighting on the front lines of the Vietnam War without saying so explicitly. This is the brilliance of Kubrick, and Full Metal Jacket is not immune to it.Two different films united by Kubrick's genius cinematography, I give Full Metal Jacket 4.0 stars out of 5."
aprilzh,"Feb 9, 2020",10/10,"From the very opening of the film it's just one great moment after an other. So much of this masterpiece is so very original, from the quotable lines to the perfect scenes. The film is very well acted and very well cast. Stanley Kubrick famously stated that he preferred adapting novels and improving upon them, and he proves his theory here. The use of music is great as well, particularly in the ending scene as well as in the one with the prostitute, which might be one if the single greatest scenes in any film ever. And while I'm not normally crazy about narration in film, it is very well done here. I've seen it many times and it never gets old. Some people don't enjoy it the first time, possibly due to the unusual structure, but I think if you watch it again you'll really get to see it for what it is: a masterpiece."
DunnDeeDaGreat,"Dec 10, 2001",N/A,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made. The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting. Matthew Modine is great as Joker, but it's Vincet D'Onforio and R.Lee Emery as Pyle and the Drill Sgt. The chemistry between these two actors is of David and Goliath calbiar. The film makes you feel like you're in basic training with the troops and although the film is violent it's still an art form. **** out ****."
ccthemovieman-1,"Mar 29, 2007",6/10,"Well, the drill sergeant in this film certainly was memorable. No one will argue that. How good this film is overall, however, is up to debate. My feeling is that it's overrated because Stanley Kubrick - a favorite of critics - directed the movie and helped write the screenplay.It's notable, mainly for the ultra-profane and ultra-color descriptions that Lee Ermey uses as ""Gny. Sgt. Hartman,"" the Parris Island Marine drill-gunnery sergeant. Hearing several of his tirades is something you won't forget!At times, the film is too hard-edged, too political, too preachy and just not a smooth enough story. You know it could be much better.Yes, if my ears can stand the assault, Ermey can be fun to hear, and young, fat Vincent D'Onofrio as ""Pvt. Pyle,"" the victim of the sergeant's rage, terminates his boss in a memorable scene, the main character of the film is ""Pvt. Joker,"" played by Matthew Modine, and I didn't like the guy. Maybe that's another reason I don't rate this film as highly as others. I couldn't root for the guy the scriptwriters made as the ""good guy.""The clincher came when Pvt. Joker told the sergeant he didn't believe in the Virgin Mary, which got him points with the sarge. Being a non-Believer meant the ""kid is all right."" That, of course, is ultra-secular Kubrick getting his atheist propaganda in, something he did in several of his films.After watching several years of the TV program, Law and Order: Criminal Intent, it would be interesting (and strange) go back now and see D'Onofrio again. I probably wouldn't recognize him. After watching him as the dignified Sherlock-Holmes type ""Detective Robert Goren,"" I don't know if I want to see him back in this role, however!"
dramontheastronomer,"Jul 3, 2019",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket grabs you by the throat and drags you along all the different and equally vile muds of the Vietnam war. No, actually; it goes further than that - it drags you on the muds of war and vileness as a whole.Through grounded and subtle dialogue; believable and passionate acting; an intense and terrifying score; brilliantly detailed and realistic set and costume design; beautiful and jarring shot composition and cinematography; real and powerful themes brought about with character and motif; and a storytelling technique with total literary cohesion and keen detail; Kubrick and his cast and crew build a world within our own that is direct, poignant and honestly brutal.This film shows precisely why violence can only cause violence. It shows how the peaceful can become the terrible and how the beautiful can become the ugly. Full Metal Jacket explains that war is not hell - because hell is for sinners only.It is quite probably possible to explain for hours how each character and action in the movie portrays Joker's line on duality. Perhaps it is possible to take such time to explain the theme's (or should it be ""themes'""?) connection even to the set design, musical choices, and costumes. But this is a review, not a thesis. So we shall leave that for another time.Watch this movie, but be fully prepared for its intense and disturbing violence.tl;dr: it's a Stanley Kubrick movie."
theVade,"Jul 11, 2017",5/10,"Full Metal Jacket was one of Kubrick's better films, and to be honest I was pretty torn on what to give this film. Although many will go against my decision, I decided to give Full Metal Jacket an ""Alright"" on theVade Review Bar or a 5 out of 10. The film had outstanding visuals and audio design, but Kubrick's odd way of storytelling bogs down the movie and ultimately hurts the film's pacing, character development, and much more. The acting in the film was great, and the tone literally put you back into the Vietnam War in 1968 (when the second and third act take place). This was an extremely hard film to watch, but I felt it was an absolute great representation of what war really is. So in conclusion, although Full Metal Jacket had some great moments, it was ultimately three short films tied together by one thing.. Kubrick. And I'm sorry, but that just isn't good enough.Read more at theVade."
phillythekid15,"Mar 20, 2006",10/10,"With all of Stanley Kubrick's films, I have never been disappointed by any of them. From Dr. Strangelove to Full Metal Jacket, his work has captured my eyes and made many of my days.Its amazing how well Kubrick forms his characters and gets you to almost be in their shoes. Especially in Full Metal Jacket, its fun to see how the characters in every scene act or turn out.One of my favorite aspects of Kubrick is making a man look insane or crazy such as in A Clockwork Orange (with his character Alexander), the Shining (Mr. Torrence) and in Full Metal Jacket (Private Pyle) which was one of my favorite scenes in the movie.R. Lee Ermey's character was played so well, I felt as if I was being lectured by him. His smart and funny remarks made the beginning of the movie all the more enjoyable.So in the end, you must see this movie if you think you appreciate movies.********** out of **********"
ma-cortes,"Jun 15, 2023",8/10,"A very strong and tough Vietnam war film made by the great Stanley Kubrick who has directed his film in the form of military drama , a formula much beloved by filmmakers of Hollywood , War and western movies , and revived successfully by this great director who at the same time keeps his recurring theme of dehumanization. The story opens in the late 1960s at Parris Island, South Carolina, the U. S. Marine Corps Training Camp, providing a brooding , sad look at Marine basic training . There a group of young Marine recruits, after having their heads shaved, are being prepped for basic training by the two-fisted Drill Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey), whose orders are to ""weed out all non-hackers"". Hartman gives each of the Marines nicknames; one pragmatic recruit who talks behind his back becomes ""Joker"" (Matthew Modine); a Texas recruit becomes ""Cowboy"" (Arliss Howard). And finally Leonard Lawrence, a 6-foot 3-inch, 280 pound, slow-witted recruit with low intelligence and ambition becomes ""Gomer Pyle"" (Vincent D'Onofrio) . One rifle, one gun, one for killing, one for fun !. In Vietnam The Wind Doesn't Blow It Sucks ! Vietnam can kill me, but it can't make me care ! Acclaimed by critics as the best war movie ever made ! .Born to Kill !.One of the best Vietnam war movies that took Stanley Kubrick more than a year to make . A sour and intelligent view of the Vietnam war is provided in all terrible , bloody and violent detail . This is a stunning adaptation of Gustav Hasford's ""The short time"" , being divided in two sections . Blundering , thorny and interesting Vietnam war film pre-dating the flood of the eighties and early nineties . It describes a pretty crude portrayal of America's thunderous days in Vietnam . Including a realist and thought-provoking dialogue with plenty of profanities , bad taste , swearings and sexual remarks. The story falls into two harrowing halves , both familiar staples of military movies . The particularly hard training of a group of Marine recruits and the combat action , in a slightly stylised and sanitised Vietnam which , as benefits the English locations , seemed devoid of jungle , but full od shattered villages , ruined towns and glowing skies .The feeling of these scenes is faintly unreal. More realistic , indeed the best thing about the movie , results to be the drill instructor , brutal Gunnery Sergeant : R. Lee Ermey , a real ex-drill himself , he's terrific , his dialogue is presumably ripped from his own experience in all its crudeness but often amusing colour . The fist half is so strong that the second half suffers in comparison , as it covers more familiar ground while keeping tension , thrills and emotions in check. Interpretations are uniformly good , with a lot of newcomers actors to be followed notorious careers , such as : Matthew Modine , Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Dorian Harewood , Arliss Howard , John Terry , among others .The picture was finely acted , compellingly made and supremely directed by Stanley Kubrick . His film debut was ¨Fear and desire¨ 1953 , a not very successful Kubrick movie , belonging to his early period when he made black and white , low budgeted flicks as the Film Noir : ¨Killer's Kiss¨ , ¨The Killing¨ and continuing with one of the best wartime pictures : ¨Paths of Glory¨ produced and played by Kirk Douglas . As Kirk hired Kubrick to direct the blockbuster epic ¨Spartacus¨. Following the polemic film : ¨Lolita¨ with James Mason, Sue Lyon . And going on three hits in Sci-Fi and Dystopian genre as ¨Dr Strangelove or how I learned to stop worrying and love the bomb¨, ¨2001 a space odyssey¨ , ¨A Clockwork Orange¨. In 1975 he directed the great costumer movie ¨Barry Lyndon¨ with Ryan O'Neal , Marisa Berenson. And other genre movies as the terror in ¨The Shining¨ based on Stephen King novel and this warfare film : ¨Full Metal Jacket¨. And his last one : ¨Eyes Wide Shut¨ with big name stars as Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman. Rating : 8/10 . Above average . The film wil appeal to Stanley Kubrick enthusiasts and Vietnam films fans ."
PWNYCNY,"Mar 12, 2018",8/10,"This is an excellent movie, for a while. R. Lee Ermey gives a riveting performance as the arch typical drill instructor, Sgt. Hartman. Ermey's performance should have earned him an Academy Award. In fact, it can be argued that Ermey's presence makes this movie special. Out side of that, the movie falters. Sgt. Hartman states clearly at the start that his order is weed out those who cannot hack his beloved Marine Corps. That means finding the bad apples. Yet, despite all his threats and abuse and blustering, nobody gets weeded out. The story line contains huge holes. First, regarding Gomer Pyle. Pyle fails at everything, yet Hartman does not flunk him out. Instead, he employs terror to try to get Pyle, a hapless screw up, to comply. Nothing helps, yet Pyle makes it. Boot camp has taught him only one thing: how to kill Hartman. Second, the story abruptly switches to Vietnam. The troops are cynical, demoralized and dysfunctional. They lack unit cohesion and esprit de corps. However, the story fails to explain the cause of their malaise. Joker, another bad apple from boot camp, is still in the Marines. Third, the character Animal Mother. His presence in the story is seems to make no sense, except that he is yet another bad apple that the Marines never weeded out. He's just more overtly anti-social. This entire movie depicts the military as a sham. Tell that to those who actually serve."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 18, 2023",9/10,"For the first half of this film, you will find perfection, in every sense of the word. It is the most perfect first half of a film I have ever seen, with an unforgettable Academy-Award winning performance by R Lee Ermey, a relentless brutal drill sergeant. This IS Basic Training in spades. The dialogue is absolutely perfect. The best Basic Training film of all time. The film falls off a bit in the second half, as our recruits are now in Vietnam, but for the most part, Matthew Modine gives a very good performance as Joker. In the first half of the film. Vincent D'onofrio gives a spectacular performance as Private Pyle, named by the drill sergeant because he considers this recruit a mess as a soldier.Stanley Kubrick has made so many good films, one cannot list them all, but a few of my favorites were Clockwork Orange and Space Odyssey 2001. He has added another classic smash hit to his collection with this film. Don't miss it.Director."
RobTheWatcher,"Apr 6, 2022",6/10,"I was excited to see this for the first time since this has often been referred to as one of the best war movies ever but I was actually disappointed. The first 30 minutes were great but for me it fell apart after that. It just got drawn out and boring to follow. Also the acting was lackluster. I will say it's impressive quality for the late 80s but still, just an okay movie."
troy-daniel-bush,"May 18, 2021",9/10,"No real point in singing this movie's praises, or saying Stanley Kubrick was a genius and a master of his craft. I'll just say that I think this movie is, as I've said in the title, almost perfect.A common criticism with this movie is that the second half is not as hard-hitting as the first, and I agree. Had it been this movie would be a 10/10 for me. The second half is still dark, vicious, and funny, just not as much as the first half is."
eightyfourever,"Nov 25, 2014",4/10,"I found the equipment, men and locations etc to be to clean which did not reflect the reality. Our guys over there believed in the cause in the beginning. Incrementally feelings changed to less and less. Then came Tet, not long after frag incidents really kicked off. Short timers just counted days and tried to steer clear of engagements. The men still fought for each other it's just short timers were really careful. Overall not a bad movie maybe the youth of our country will learn it's not always wise to volunteer. For it's time the movie does an OK job telling a story and the dialog is not that bad. For all those who fought were injured or killed they did the best they could, thank you."
Jeremy_Urquhart,"Mar 20, 2023",9/10,"This was the second film in a Kubrick double feature I saw at my local cinema tonight. Unlike with the first film, A Clockwork Orange, I feel like seeing Full Metal Jacket on the big screen (and a few years older than last time I watched it) made me like it a lot more.Long story short, I used to love the first half of this film and like the second half, but felt confused about how they connected. It seems obvious now, but this time around, it felt like one coherent movie. Key parts of the first half echoed in the second, and it overall shows how soldiers are dehumanised and traumatised before they even reach the frontlines of a war. It's a big, ugly machine, and Full Metal Jacket shows it's just as ugly whether you're being trained to kill or being made to kill.It gets into the heads of its fairly straightforward characters, and it's as much a psychological drama as it is a war film. Part of me wishes Joker had a little more to do as a main character, but he still works well to anchor the whole thing, and is ultimately a changed person by the end.The actual transition between the first and second halves still feels a little jarring to me, but other than the specific point where they join, Full Metal Jacket now feels like a complete film, rather than a scrambled collection of great scenes. Maybe that's me getting older, or maybe seeing it in a cinema helped. Maybe it's both, and I'm just trying to make a comment on the duality of man or something..."
eonbluedan-1,"Jan 2, 2011",10/10,"He could be cold, harsh and mechanical with his style, precise as a surgeon's knife, and some didn't like that, but who better to make a film, not about war, but about the dehumanisation of the process, but Stanley Kubrick? The fact his vision of the story was so clinical really helped make this, quietly, the best war film ever made; Stanely never did things by halves.Every frame is weighted with oppression, each moment is saying something; every line, every gesture, delivered to fit Kubrick's vision. It made a star of Lee Ermey, whose Drill Sergeant was terrifyingly real, primarily because that is what he was in reality.Like all of Kubrick's work, this film contains iconic imagery that sears into your mind's eye and becomes very hard to erase; the final scenes, and the film's closing, with its perfect marriage of image, sound, and music, haunt you and leave you reflecting on the last 2 two hours."
antonjsw1,"Jul 20, 2010",10/10,"This is an excellent film that shows that film maker Stanley Kubrick has lost none of his skill despite a 7 year break between projects.The film is plotted in two distinct parts, the first half, which is the stronger part is concerned with the impact of brutal training on the wannabe soldiers, with the second part focusing on the story told from the central character, Private Joker, played by an effective Matthew Modine in a deliberate low key and understated manner. In fact most of the performances are subdued, with the exception of Adam Baldwin as a cynical and brutal Animal Mother and particularly Lee Ermey, who steals the show as the ruthless drill sergeant. He is totally captivating in the role, even if his character spends most of his time by humiliating the recruits - though the film posits that there are potentially tragic consequences with this approach as well as the production of a group of lethal killers.The second part of the film is still effective though, even it isn't quite as captivating as the first half. Vietnam is very well realised, particularly since it was shot in London's Docklands, which was derelict at the time! This is a tribute to Kubrick's skill as a director, particularly with his use of steadicam to develop a cold, objective realism peppered with black humour. Huge credit must also go Anton Furst's outstanding work as production designer and Vivian Kubricks score, though minimalist, is interesting and gives a refreshing and different feel to this non-typical war film. Martin Hunter's editing is also first rate.In summary and efficient, and highly effective observation of the dehumanisation of warfare on the soldier made with trademark Kubrick precision"
Drywall,"Mar 31, 2005",10/10,"I have heard of the idea that every war movie is in fact an anti-war movie, because they all show the horror and brutality of the situation.I do not agree.Some war films, while showing violence and blood, have stories describing how war gives people the potential to be heroes; movies like 'Saving Private Ryan', 'A Bridge Too Far' and even 'The Great Escape' fall into this trap; they seem to say that, even though war is terrible, some good can come from it.A true anti-war film has no heroes. The statement is very clear: war turns men into vicious animals, with no drives except to eat, copulate, and kill. Films in this category include 'King Rat', 'The Dirty Dozen', 'Platoon', and of course Stanley Kubrick's 'Full Metal Jacket'.With 'Jacket', Kubrick provides what is perhaps the most comprehensive and complete overview of how human beings are de-evolved through the military process. He begins in boot camp, where they are treated as scum, beaten and abused, and (in some cases) driven completely mad. By the time they reach the field, they are ""killing machines...angels of death"", and the horror of battle only makes it worse.They suppress fear, pity, love...and and all emotions that distinguish humans from animals. Sex is purely physical gratification, and killing is a rush. There is no loyalty or patriotism; the desire to retrieve a wounded comrade is more akin to how a pack of wolves protects one of its own. They act on instinct rather than reason, and they do not hesitate to destroy everything they see.That is the plot of Full Metal Jacket. The movie itself is a scathing example of how horrible war truly is. Perhaps there is the potential for heroism...but few, if any, rise to it."
benturkalj,"Oct 5, 2005",10/10,"I know it is certainly a big call to call this the best Vietnam movie of all time, but this is probably the most realistic account of it. It is also a great example of Director Kubrick's ability to show humans objectively, not trying to make out whether one is evil or not.Essentially the movie is divided into two parts. The first revolves around the training of marines, and shows the brutality of becoming a soldier. The second part then focuses on the actual battlefield.What is interesting about this film is that it isn't particularly violent, but still extremely powerful. This is about the psychology of War, about how various soldiers deal with a mad mad situation, and it does a great job of depicting this.Everything about this film is great. The acting is top notch from a cast of mostly unknowns, and the score is used to haunting effect. Camera shots also brilliantly portray the scenes, often from the point of view of the person shooting, to great effect. And if anything can be said to recommend this film, it is that there many great scenes that you will definitely never forget. A masterpiece."
Quinoa1984,"Jan 13, 2000",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket. Ohe could write about how startling a film this is even the 10th or 11th or 15th time you've seen it, like I have up to now (as with most of Kubrick's films I've lost count how many times I've seen on a television screen, in the theater is another matter); how chilling it is to see once again the same method previously experienced in Clockwork Orange of rip-roaring, abyss-black satire blending together with a sense of tragedy and horror that is ever so rare in cinema (i.e. going from a vicious combat scene to the song ""Bird is the Word"" played over more combat, or just the general serio-comic attitude between Hartman and Pyle); how the ending brings to a head a fresh concern in the war film that is still as depressing, if not as authentically tear-jerky, as Paths of Glory; how any image seen on a big screen from Kubrick is Solid Gold, or how, admittedly, one or two scenes don't quite work that great (i.e. the ""documentary"" interviews the soldiers give to the camera crew).But since that's been written, might as well just sign the Mickey Mouse Club scene and go on with your day."
davidmvining,"Nov 26, 2019",7/10,"I can imagine myself in a few years wondering, ""What did I think of that one movie?"" I would pull up the blog, do a quick search, find the review, and be refreshed with my attempts at insight. My opinion that day would be reinforced by the opinion I had years back. Full Metal Jacket, though, is a film that I am always certain will have changes of opinion over time. Out of all the films that I have reviewed so far, this is the one that I feel like I could review again in a year and come to very different conclusions.I've seen this film four times, and I'm still coming to terms with it. I've moved beyond the idea that the first forty-five minutes are a mini-movie and wholly superior to the final seventy minutes. I still think that the first section of the film on Parris Island is superior to the second long section that ends the film, but there's definitely a deeper relationship between the Private Joker character. There are themes and motifs at play in the first half that continue into the second. I just can't quite get past a few things that hamper the whole experience for me.The events on Parris Island are both hilarious and horrifying, often at the same time. A group of marine recruits goes through basic training, and we latch onto two of the largely interchangeable maggots as main character, Private Joker and Private Pyle. These are, of course, not their real names, but the nicknames stick. They are robbed of who they were before walking onto the island. There's that dehumanization idea that keeps popping up in Kubrick's filmography. The process of training strips even the interior individuality so that they all become alike in behavior, marching perfectly in time, performing the same actions, and reacting the same way to their drill instructor.Our two main characters have different paths to this sameness. Joker is smart and thoughtful which allows him to navigate the minefield of the instructor's verbal jabs in ways that do him credit, eventually getting him the position of squad leader. Pyle, on the other hand, is stupid (not pejoratively, mind you, Pyle is obviously supposed to have an IQ of less than 90) and has incredible difficulty adapting to life in the corps. He has trouble telling his left from his right. He can't master the obstacle course. He hides jelly donuts in his footlocker. It is only after Joker is forced to take Pyle under his wing that Pyle begins to shape up, turning the corner in his training, and eventually going way too far in the other direction. He becomes the ultimate psychotic killing machine, putting a round into the drill instructor's chest after graduation before shooting himself in the head.Just from a cinematic experience point of view, this first forty-five minutes is a tour de force. It's nearly impressionistic and heavily reliant on editing to create the general sense of unease that pulls us in as we watch the humanity stripped so completely from Pyle to the point that he does only kill.The second section ends up feeling both more straight forward cinematically and more confused narratively, which can create a certain letdown from a movie going point of view. However, as I wrote earlier, there are stronger connections between the two sections that my first viewings of the film originally revealed to me.Animal Mother, for instance, seems like another version of Pyle. He seems pretty dim the first time we meet him, but he's also obviously a great killing machine. Knowing that the movie ends with Joker leading the survivors of the film in a rendition of the theme song to ""The Mickey Mouse Club House"", I began considering what that could mean more than an hour before it came up, and the idea of infantilization creeped into my brain. I began to watch as a group of children lost every parental figure they had (starting with the drill instructor) until they were faced with a great life or death situation without any guidance from a higher authority. There are also signs of the breakdown of all civilization in the face of war, an idea so big I'm not sure it fits terribly well in only seventy-minutes of screentime.And that's where I end up. I feel like this second half is simply tackling too much. Breakdown, though, is a great lens to view it through. Joker starts this section negotiating with a hooker for her time, playfully joking with her. That attitude extends through his meetings with his CO as a reporter for Stars and Stripes. His life is easy hidden away in Saigon. He can talk big about his time in the  and no one can really challenge him. It's when the Tet Offensive begins that his veneer of bravery breaks down and he starts shooting maniacally at a small invading force. He then gets sent out into the field to document some of the counter action.It's about here that I feel the movie just begins to break down itself narratively. From the time Joker is reunited with his mate from Parris Island (Private Cowboy) to the time that their squad leader dies in the final city, the movie kind of just swirls around without a real direction. There's marching and everyone talks big about nothing in particular. It's more of a dick measuring contest than anything else, and it culminates in another scene about a hooker as the men negotiate with her pimp and then jockey for who gets her first. As a contrast to the first hooker scene, Joker has little to say or do here. He's no longer standing out, and he's been pushed more to the background. Much like in Parris Island, he's more of one of several than an individual again.From purely a filmmaking perspective, the final thirty minutes, as the squad gets pinned down by a hidden sniper in a building, might be as good as the movie's first forty-five minutes. This stuff is really well filmed with clear action, a great outdoor set, smoke, and fire. It's tense as the squad watches several of their comrades take repeated sniper fire, mortally wounding them but not killing them, and the rest find a way around the sniper's position. It's a great sustained sequence that ends with the reveal that the sniper is a young girl, a wonderful point of irony to cap off the movie that's pretty steeped in it.Some more technical notes real quick. It's screamingly obvious that this movie wasn't filmed in Vietnam. It was filmed in England, and there's no place in England that looks like a Vietnamese paddy field, so there are numerous shots of the countryside that looks like flat bits of England with palm trees. The giant set that ends the film is both a blessing and a curse. When the frame's edges are filled with parts of the set, I find it completely convincing. When the edges of the frame extend out beyond the set, it once again feels like an outdoor set in the middle of England. I was also assured by my high school history teacher (who was a marine who had done three tours of duty in Vietnam) that while the yelling of the drill instructor was spot on, drill instructors would never ever strike a recruit.So, that's kind of where I am overall with the film. I know that the first half informs the second half, but I still haven't quite figured out how. I think I can grasp the overall thematic thrust of the film, but I haven't really developed it in my own head. I believe that there's more to this movie than my first four viewings have left with me, and I'm more than willing to give the film another try in the future. But for now, I have to embrace the incongruity between the two major sections, the flaccidity of a large part of the second section, and an opaqueness that I can't quite get through, and relegate Full Metal Jacket to the second tier of Kubrick's filmography. Maybe when I revisit this again in a year or so, I'll read this and build on my original thoughts instead of just repeating them. We shall see."
bastigonzales,"Dec 2, 2020",6/10,"The 1st half is one of the best i've seen in any war movie. It's fun, entertaining, funny (at some scenes), compelling to watch on how the characters are developing. I got disappointed on the 2nd half of the film its like directed by a different person. Scenes are not that great the action is amazing even in todays standards so that's a plus but overall the movie is amazing if it wasn't for the 2nd half smh"
st-shot,"Jun 4, 2007",5/10,"By the time Stanley Kubrick made Full Metal Jacket it was evident the once enormously talented director had lost a step or two. Barry Lyndon was a beautiful bore to endure and his adaption of Stephen King's The Shining was drained of terror. Full Metal continued the slide but did not end it. The worst was yet to come with Eyes Wide Shut.Jacket is Kubrick's late entry to a long line of Viet Nam films that followed the unpopular war. The first half takes place on Paris Island where Marine recruits are put through basic training. It is a brutal and suspenseful first half made all the more powerful by Lee Ermey's intense DI. Once overseas the film founders badly. Kubrick keeps his camera moving with elaborate pans and tracking shots but his actors become lifeless caricatures and psychos, a rich pastiche of ugly Americans and moronic commanders. In Strangelove there was a dark comic touch that made it work. Here it only shows an out of touch artist trying to be relevant and hip with a paler Apocalypse Now take that was done (and done a lot better) eight years earlier.The last half hour really exacerbates matters with a scene that concerns routing a sniper. To maintain suspense this long is impossible in such a situation and it is proved here. There is also a contrived denouement to the whole scene that rings hollow.Put another director's moniker on it and the crit's would give it passable grades as an anti-war film with a touch too much self indulgence and sluggish editing. But since it's Stanley's watch what you say. Well since it is Stanley's I give Metal a five instead of a six since the great cutting edge director of classic original film work as Dr.Strangelove, 2001, A Space Odyssey and Clockwork Orange followed this time instead of taking the lead as he has done in the past. In this case with a less than impressive effort that borrows heavily from some of his past works."
Frequency270,"Apr 25, 2004",9/10,"""Full Metal Jacket"" follows a single Marine-nicknamed Joker(Mathew Modine)-through boot camp and a portion of his time in Vietnam. It is loosely based on the story 'Short Timers' by Gustav Hasford. It is directed by Stanley Kubrick, known for long, eccentric movies that weave surreal and super real characteristics blended together, creating nightmarish, hollow and disconcerting movies.The boot camp portion of this film is what most people remember. The drill instructor is played by R. Lee Emery, and it is one of the most terrifying, moving, funny and convincing performances in movie history. Virtually a non-stop rant from his first appearances to his last he electrifies the performances around him and puts the viewer in boot camp with the rest of the recruits. Vincent D'Onofrio does well as Private Pyle, overacting in only one scene-though it is a critical scene. Matthew Modine's performance is almost tertiary to Emery and D'Onofrio's performance. We do get see him develop a little, the positive characteristics that will make him strong in Vietnam.The second portion blends sixties rock n' roll and Vietnamese urban warfare to tremendous effect. The war effort is crumbling and Reporter Sgt Joker is sent to the front to support infantry and get stories for the ""Stars and Stripes"". There, Joker confronts the full effects of war on himself, friends and strangers. One is hard pressed to remember at points that it is just a movie, so comfortable and real are the actors in their surroundings. The Door Gunner ('ain't war hell?'), Animal Mother, 8-ball and Cowboy are consumed by their roles.It is definitely not a movie for those easily offended by language. As an anti-war movie, it seems to have exactly the opposite effect. Nonetheless, it is a powerful performance, with the entire cast making it greater than the sum of its parts. It is the finest Kubrick movie that I've seen(out of eight). I recommend it for anyone over the age of sixteen who enjoys action or war movies. I rate this movie at nine stars out of ten. It truly deserves to be an American classic."
masonsaul,"Sep 10, 2019",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket tackles familiar themes but is still an incredible war movie that's darkly comedic, intense, emotional and harrowing. Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin and Arliss Howard all give incredible performances. R. Lee Ermey is perfect. The pacing is great and Stanley Kubrick's direction is also incredible. The soundtrack is great and the musical score is amazing."
opuffen,"May 11, 2005",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" does for the Vietnam war what ""Saving Private Ryan"" did for WWII- create a strikingly (and sometimes disturbingly) realistic portrait of the horrors of war. However, FMJ's depiction of the de-humanizing affects of boot camp and later the psychological effects of war on soldiers (similar to Apocalypse Now) set it apart from many other war films, such as Private Ryan. Matthew Modine and Adam Baldwin give excellent performances of de-sensitized GIs, but the true standout of the cast is R. Lee Ermey as the drill instructor at Paris Island boot camp. Despite the fact that the film was shot entirely in Britain, Kubrick does a very convincing job of recreating Vietnam there, and all aspects of the film are very realistic and authentic. Also unlike other war films, FMJ doesn't focus on the action and violence (which is still very realistic) and instead relies on complex characters to drive the story. Modine's Pvt. Joker is especially interesting, dying to get into action one minute, but once the bullets start whizzing, scared out of his wits.Bottom Line: an excellent war film, and should be considered one of the best of all time. ***1/2 out of ****"
tnrcooper,"Dec 6, 2010",10/10,"The comments by many vets on this site, saying that this film to some degree reflects the nature of war, should be the highest praise for this film. I scanned the reviews looking for the comments of vets and found, in the first 14 pages, 6 vets stating that key elements of this film mirrored to some degree their experiences in Vietnam. I found this movie amazing. I agree with many of the more widely-held conclusions about this film. R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sgt. Hartman is incredible, as is Vincent D'Onofrio as the tragic Pvt. Pyle. There certainly are two sections to this film, but the inspiration for both parts come from the same book and so, if both parts of the movie can be inspired by the same real lives, then it seems we should accept that both parts reflect different aspects of the military experience. I think that is fair. Capturing the emotional and psychological brutality of bootcamp, along with the horrors and the banality of war seem to be reasonable things to include in the same film.If anyone thinks that this film glamorizes war-from the death of Pvt. Pyle to the predicted destruction of the unit charged with taking out the sniper, as well as the sniper at the end of the film-they must be a psychopath."
WilliamCQ,"May 7, 2004",9/10,"This is an awesome movie, I just saw it for the first time a few minutes ago, I rate it 9/10. The intensity and action just doesn't stop except for a few minutes as when Cowboy is struggling with Animal for a cease-fire ... The feature is visually stunning, nice scenery, a few ""gooks"" up-close and lots of weapons and war-torn buildings. There's a wide range of emotions except for romance, hurray for realism ! You can see tree facets of the war going from training and it's hardship to comfy position finished by smelling blood. It's odd that they chose Joker, a war correspondant (journalist), for a main character ; I guess they wanted to show the hardening of a pretty normal guy instead of just jumping in the action with a testosterone/adrenaline junkie lusting for a kill seen in countless movies, it's more human that way."
spenrh,"Jan 9, 2019",7/10,"I've read that Lee Ermy's sergeant in this movie is not an exaggeration from how many sergeants have acted towards their recruits during basic training, the only difference is now sergeants are no longer allowed to put their hands on the trainees. However, all the verbal action and style in how they push them through training is spot on.Ermy, as Sergeant Gunnery, has the hapless Private Pyle as his favorite target due to his overweight, lazy, slacker yet smug attitude he had, well he started out smug before Gunnery broke his spirit. And he made sure to keep any of Pyle's laziness, his wiseacre tendencies, and his spirit away for good if he could help it. Much of the first half of the film is centered around the basic training and Ermy's constant belittling and bullying Pyle.In the real life military basic training, most trainees like Pyle would've been discharged or dropped out before Pyle went anywhere. Ermy seemed to have had a special need for keeping him there as his punching bag. However, it could also be argued that maybe also he felt underneath that through enough pushing, he could eventually have made a real soldier out of Pyle. He was wrong about that, with the top climatic showdown of the movie (which was not near the end like in most movies) between Gunnery and Pyle, along with his famous ""what's yer major malfunction!!!?"", and the surprise (well, the surprise for someone not like me who seen this movie many times).Other great moments during training including Pyle's reprocussions for sneaking in a donut (and the other recruits with the socks full of metal locks), the obstacle courses (particularly with Pyle's struggling through them), and the always tense introduction of the recruits with the Sergeant when standing down (along with the line copied from ""Officer and a gentleman"", ""Only steers and q****s come from Texas!! I don't see no horns!!"").All above being the first half of the movie which was much better than the second. The second part took place in Vietnam, minus the two biggest characters from the first half, and was basically just another cutout copy of films on troops in Vietnam. And, there have really been better movies about troops fighting in Vietnam such as ""Platoon"", ""Good morning Vietnam"", and even in ""Forrest Gump"".Arlis Howard was one of the main characters in the Vietnam section, who I remember from ""Plain clothes"" where he played an undercover cop posing as a highschool student to help solve a murder of one of the teachers. And there was that talked about prosritute scene in the Vietnam part which I didn't find that great. I honestly have on several occasions only watched this movie to see the basic training half, and have only seen the movie all the way through about half the times I've seen it."
SmileysWorld,"Apr 10, 2002",8/10,"First,let me state,that this is without question the nastiest movie,in terms of language,that I have ever seen.I am normally a person,who, though I rarely use bad language myself,am able to tolerate it when I hear it.With this film,however,I found myself blushing at the language used by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (they could not have picked a better actor to portray this man than R. Lee Ermey,by the way).Not only is war hell,preparing for it can be just as bad,if you don't have a healthy state of mind to begin with.This is the case for Pvt. Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio,who really packed on the pounds for this role).You can almost feel him cracking throughout the first portion of the film,leading to a violent showdown with his tormenting commanding officer.The second half of the film is a basic display of the horrors of war itself,and very well done.Excellent direction by Stanley Kubrick,who always seemed to have a knack for not repeating himself a director,in terms of the types of films he directed.This was his ""war"" film,and it's an absolute masterpiece.Must see film."
corceiro,"Apr 26, 2019",7/10,"""Full Metal Jacket"" will always be judged by the shadow of previous Kubrick's movies. And that's why I think it could be much better. I watched it ten or more times and I always ask myself why Stanley Kubrick chosen this script. You can't forget that his previous movie was ""The Shining"" back in 1980 and he was desperate for a good story (not a statement about Vietnam war) and this option came as a surprise for everyone in the industry. The movie is build around characters and there wasn't much space for the attention for that little tiny microscopic detail, so important to Kubrick's work, that's why I consider it an atypical movie in his directing career. That care for the visual detail would return with his final and baroque movie."
AnusPresley,"Dec 14, 2018",2/10,"FFS - Full Metal Jacket. Re-watching it because it's on teevee (can't even be bothered to steal it)I told myself to never watch a Kubrick twice, except for Strangelove. What a tedious repetitive prick. Every shot is a replay of 2001/Clockwork Orange.Want reality? Sam Peckinpah. Crap free grit you can smell.The clown is not an auteur, he is a technician. ""Specialisation is for insects"" - Robert Heinlein. He's a cockroach. No wonder Nicole Kidman and Tom Cruise grovelled at his feet. They're imbeciles.Footnote: after the movie resumed after an ad break, I thought it was a mobile phone ad. Except it ran for more than 30 seconds. That's how good Kubrick actually is."
TheMovieDiorama,"Mar 9, 2018",8/10,"A smart move from the legend that was Stanley Kubrick. We've all seen many war films, a genre that is well explored from a variety of different conflicts. Full Metal Jacket however chooses to go behind the scenes and focus on the training process that changes well intentioned men into trained lethal killers. You could easily split this in half and have two separate films, the first half being more psychologically charged whereas the latter showcasing the brutality of warfare. A ridiculously serious drill sergeant practically bullying a trainee marine so harshly that it slowly turns him into an unstable psychopath. That right there, was some really good psychology and made the film so much more interesting. Sure the Vietnam War scenes were depicted with a substantial amount of fire, blood and guns but it was the first half that really captivated me. Vincent D'Onofrio was the stand out for me, both convincing and expressive through his face. Matthew Modine was good, probably his best performance. Lee Ermey deserves recognition just for somehow managing to not lose his voice from all the shouting. Characterisation was present, perhaps not fully fleshed out as I would like but was just enough for me to care about them. Yet again though, it's the technical marvel that wins...Stanley Kubrick. His directing style is so damn flawless. The nice clean long takes, actors looking directly into the camera, slow motion deaths (particularly in the sniper shootout)...he is just phenomenal. Script was sharp as well. A great section of dialogue where our lead character wears a peace badge and a helmet that says ""born to kill"" for which he describes represents the duality of man. That really stuck with me. So whilst it might feel like two separate films (due to that ridiculously quick transition), it's hard not to appreciate everything that's shown to us. Another hit from Mr. Kubrick."
Cinemaniac1984,"Jan 1, 2023",10/10,"Based on the novel ""The Short Timers"" by Gustav Hasford, Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies about the Vietnam War along with memorable performances from Matthew Modine, Vincent D'Onofrio, R. Lee Ermey, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard, and Dorian Harewood. Having returned after being away since The Shining (1980), Director Stanley Kubrick showcases his brilliance once again bringing Full Metal Jacket to life on the big screen which was met with critical acclaim and also a hit at the box office. It was also nominated for an Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay.Full Metal Jacket is divided into two parts. The first half of the movie takes place on Parris Island where recruit training takes place. Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann (the late R. Lee Ermey) is the senior drill instructor who ruthlessly puts the new recruits through a brutal boot camp transforming them into Marines with the intention of producing Marines ready to go into battle. Private Joker (Matthew Modine) is the main character in the movie and we meet him alongside other new recruits such as Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio) and Cowboy (Arliss Howard). Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann is verbally and physically abusive to the recruits though he sees himself as hard but fair. The second half of the movie takes place in the city of Hue in Vietnam. Joker has since been promoted to Sergeant and is now a war correspondent unlike other recruits who have gone on to join the infantry. While in Vietnam, Joker befriends fellow war correspondent Raftermann (Kevyn Major Howard) who are both assigned to cover the war. Joker also meets fellow marines including Animal Mother (Adam Baldwin), Eightball (Dorian Harewood), Lieutenant Touchdown (Ed O'Ross), and the sadistic doorgunner (Tim Colceri). Joker also witnesses the horrors of the war first hand but his sarcastic and dry humour have never gone away. As well as meeting many marines with colourful personalities, he finds himself caught up in the middle of combat as well as the Tet Offensive and the climax where a sniper targets the Platoon.Matthew Modine shines alongside Vincent D'Onofrio, Adam Baldwin, Arliss Howard, Dorian Harewood and Kevyn Major Howard. The standout in the movie is the late R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann. He is foul mouthed and full of colourful and derogatory insults and is seen striking the recruits. Though he sees himself as hard but fair, he is seen as a vicious bully who he has the single minded task of moulding the recruits into US Marines ready to kill the enemy.The late Stanley Kubrick did a brilliant job as writer and director. Though the movie was meant to take place in Parris Island, South Carolina and Vietnam, the entire movie was filmed in England.Full Metal Jacket was one of many movies released in the 1980's depicting the Vietnam War. It's captivating, disturbing, dark, and brilliant. Full Metal Jacket is still regarded as one of the best war movies of all time.A well deserved 10/10."
allmoviesfan,"Mar 23, 2023",9/10,"Whilst Full Metal Jacket is two hours of stunningly graphic, no-punches-pulled Vietnam War drama, whenever I think of the Stanley Kubrick masterpiece, all I can think of is the first forty-five minutes: the infamous Parris Island basic training sequence with (real life soldier) R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman and Vincent D'Onfario as Private ""Gomer Pyle"". It is brutal. Disturbing and wholly unforgettable.The second stanza of the film, combat in Hue City around the time of the NVA's Tet Offensive, is good, and in a different film might be lauded even more than it already is, but is kind of a let-down after the events that have preceded it. Ermey's performance was all the more chilling because you get the feeling he probably wasn't doing all that much acting. The scene where Hartman is lauding Oswald and Charles Whitman as determined Marines with rifles was pretty disturbing. But oh so well done.A gritty, honest Vietnam portrayal. ""The Green Berets"" this certainly is not."
aciessi,"Nov 8, 2017",9/10,"Believe it or not, this was considered a flop and a disappointment for Stanley Kubrick back in 1987. Many of his fans were expecting a war epic along the lines of Apocalypse Now. But the thing is, Kubrick already made his war epic, in Paths of Glory. Secondly, it's clear by watching the film that Kubrick's intention was not to talk about the politics of the war, or even stage big budgeted action sequences. His goal was to encapsulate the overall feeling many had about the Vietnam War on and off the battlefield. A pointless exercise of human slaughter. Vietnam, for many, was the definition of man's inhumanity to man. That is what Full Metal Jacket is truly about. The unforgettable first 45 minutes of the picture has us see the ways in which these soldiers are desensitized. The loud-mouthed, profane Sgt. Hartman humiliates the new recruits to their core and as a result, mentally destroys the most vulnerable of the recruits in Leonard ""Private Pyle"" Lawrence. Once we enter Vietnam, Kubrick shows us the casualties of war, and man's inability to show humility towards each other. In the end, Vietnam is a killing field and some of those fighting it ultimately enjoyed the killing. Full Metal Jacket doesn't resolve like a novel, nor do any of the characters receive any kind of redemption. You can say that it's in the tradition of all of Kubrick's films."
namashi_1,"Jan 12, 2010",10/10,"Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford, comes 'Full Metal Jacket', which undoubtedly is one of the finest films ever made in the history of cinema! Incredible!!! Stanley Kubrick takes us back to a squad of U.S. Marines through their United States Marine Corps Recruit Training and depicts some of the experiences of two of them in the Tet Offensive (1968) during the Vietnam War. 'Full Metal Jacket' is a so-so-so good, that I was left awe-struck. The first 40-minutes shows as how 'Maggots' turn into 'Heroes'. The rest of the 80-minutes is on the war-back-drop. The climax is epic, beautifully thought & executed.If given a chance My Review for 'Full Metal Jacket' would never end. An outstanding film, where any praise seems UN-Fulfilled.Miss anything, I mean anything, but watch 'Full Metal Jacket' right now. 1,000 Thumbs Up!"
kat-315,"May 27, 2006",N/A,"i was not overwhelmed by gunfire. i had time to know a little about the people. that made this most clever a film to me. it was focused on a small group and fewer battles, true of many films i suppose but i had much more feeling for what was going on via the visuals (thanks mr. kubrick) and the characters. especially like adam baldwin as animal mother, crazy killer with courage and comradeship. this to me is one of the most revealing and thought provoking pieces created about war apart from 'all quiet on the western front' (the novel)and for me that's really saying something. the journalistic approach works and although my friend said in the other post he felt the movie to be split in 2 i did not. the mickey mouse theme is most telling"
sue-webb-319-519,"Aug 5, 2017",7/10,"First of all I love Kubrick's work, so I came into this with a bias. However I have seen a lot of action and war films, and this one, to an individual who never went to war, seems the most true-to-life, taken as a whole. This IS how you have to look at this film, incidentally; trying to break it down into two or three parts and say which was better is missing the point of the film, I think.In the same way that ""Trainspotting"" was an anti-drug film that did not gloss over anything, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is (for me) an anti-war film that stares straight at the ugliness of war and the potential for violence within almost all people, especially those trained, conditioned, even twisted, into military roles, without preaching even a single time. Less allegory and more applicability! Wonderful!The camera work was superb. I felt like I was walking through the movie with the Marines, from the barracks to the battlefield scenes.I have seen others criticize this film for the voice over, but I felt that it was used sparingly, and was helpful, not overdone. The narrator doesn't say anything that seems out-of-place.Others have commented on the music, the acting, and so on, so I won't add my repetitive comments, except that the drill sergeant is perfect!The combination of the demented treatment the recruits receive in boot camp with the combined ""hours of boredom, seconds of terror"" feel of the Vietnam scenes is intense and not for everyone, but feels REAL.10 out of 10, perfect."
ethlaid,"Apr 13, 2021",9/10,Full Metal Jacket really highlights the effects and bizarreness of war incredibly well. As well as the duality of man and the different people in war. A Kubrick Masterpiece.
secondtake,"Jul 6, 2010",7/10,"Full Metal Jacket (1987)An extremely straight forward, funny, and tragic Vietnam War movie, going from the excessive rigors of boot camp to the hard core horrors of hand to hand combat.Stanley Kubrick shows the bare bones of it, without romanticizing, and without making heroes out of anyone. There are two main emotional turning points, one at the end of boot camp, and one near the end of the movie, and both are about the madness of war and about death. And both are pulled out of the mainstream thread of the story with a jolt. It's sensationalism, really, but made with Kubrick rigor.A balance to all the horror is the humor, not as insane as, say Dr. Strangelove, but with a similar dry wit. The first forty minutes of the film are justly famous for their almost campy but still believable scenes of the sergeant training young Marines. (And this sarge is a real Vietnam vet who did this kind of training.)Compare this movie to Platoon and you'll see a much more restrained movie, and without the jungle warfare we usually associate with Vietnam. Platoon makes people out to be larger than life, and Kubrick intends more to say, hey, this is the real deal, whatever cinematic tricks are showing.But compare this to Apocalypse Now or Deer Hunter and you might start to wish Kubrick hadn't played it so straight. Full Metal Jacket lacks, above all, imagination, and as a movie, it needs it."
jlmmjm26,"Mar 18, 2020",10/10,"Like i said, best Vietnam movie ever made. It is right there with Platoon. I always liked Platoon better as a youngster but you cant go wrong. Ermey is genius as the hard ass D.I. Very true to the period. My Dad was a Vietnam Marine so i have it on good authority. Enjoy the movie"
kingofdanerds,"Feb 23, 2021",9/10,"Stanley Kubrick is certainly a great filmmaker. Most of his films are more of an artistic creation and that is very evident in films like 2001: A Space Odyssey and The Shining. In 1986, the film Platoon was released and won Best Picture. In 1987, Full Metal Jacket was released and while it recieved positive reviews, many people compared it to Platoon and it is not hard to see why. Full Metal Jacket was based off of the 1979 novel, The Short Timers. Again, the film recieved positive reviews. I think the most famous negative review was from Roger Ebert on his TV show with Gene Siskel. Essentially, Full Metal Jacket is the first Kubrick film of my knowledge to not be so divisive amongst viewers. The film was a commercial success making well over it's budget of $16 million.The film is split into two parts. The first part follows new recruits at boot camp under the command of a very (and I mean very) abusive drill instructor Hartman. The second part sees a platoon moving through Vietnamese cities during the Tet Offensive.I remember the first time I watched Full Metal Jacket and I remember that I absolutely loving the film. Years later, I don't love it as much. Let's start with the first half of the film, Boot Camp. Many many people agree that the Boot Camp part of the film is the best part of the film. And it is. Right away, we see these new recruits lose their individuality and are starting to be molded into killing machines. This was something that was not entirely touched upon during Platoon as it did not have a boot camp scene. Come to think of it, I cannot think of any Vietnam War movie with a boot camp scene. (At this point I have not seen Apocalypse Now or The Deer Hunter). The first half is very memorable thanks to great performances by R. Lee Ermy and Vincent D'Onofrio and they perhaps the best actors in this film. There is a lot of in depth stuff that one can read into with these characters and it is really interesting. As we switch over to the second half of the film, the film somewhat loses me. The message of individuality is somewhat lost in the second half. The lead of the whole film has more focus but is not as interesting and the performance is mediocre at best. Yes, I want to see fighting in a war film and this film delivers and plays it rather well here. There is some suspense amongst the gunfire. A difference with this film when comparing it with other films is that the fighting is in a city and not the jungles. The sets look great and do look really believeable. One thing that was really interesting was the use of music. Most of the music was really cheery and happy which serves as a great contrast to the war going on. The characters in the second half are not really interesting and really the only thing I know about them are their names. To me, they are a bunch of nobodies. Things that both parts of the film have in common is the cinematography. There are some truly beautiful shots in this film. To be honest, the only way I can truly identify this as a Kubrick film, is through the camera work.For me, Full Metal Jacket is still a nice film to watch but has some flaws that keep it from being the great masterpiece that I see everyone calling it. It's message is very apparent in the first half but is easily lost within the second (and weaker) half of the film. Memorable performances from Ermy and D'Onofrio and great cinematography and effects keep me from giving this a lower rating."
stanleyhiggins,"Jun 23, 2013",10/10,"As a young man of 17, I entered Boot Camp at MCRD San Diego in July 1967. The Boot Camp segment of Full Metal Jacket is the most accurate portrayal of Marine Boot Camp ever committed to film.The Boot Camp scenes are filled with dark humor, irony, and satire, but nonetheless, this is the way Boot Camp was.Drill Instructors could be both brutal and comical, but God help you if you ever laughed in formation, no matter how comical a Drill Instructor might be while doing his best to correct a recruit's attitude.Both Gustave Hasford, a former Marine and the author of the novel, ""The Short Timers"" from which the film was adapted, and Stanley Kubrick used some literary and cinematic license, which is to be expected, but were still true to the actual experience.The accuracy was enhanced by Lee Ermey's performance as GySgt Hartman, as he was Marine Drill Instructor during his ten years in the Marine Corps.Due to having been singled out for Vietnamese language training before going to Vietnam, I missed the 1968 Tet Offensive, which was depicted in the film.While the film also takes some license with the Vietnam scenes and relied as heavily on stereotypes as in the Boot Camp scenes, those stereotypes like all stereotypes, being grounded in reality, illustrated war as it really is and remained true to the actual events of the 1968 Tet Offensive.I arrived in Vietnam in August of 1968 and I guess a bit ironically, I was wounded during the 1969 Tet Offensive, which if you haven't heard of it, don't feel bad.The Leftist media got what they wanted by depicting the 1968 Tet Offensive as a victory by the Communists, when it was actually a huge and costly failure for the Communists, and hardly mentioned the '69 offensive, which was as massive as the '68 offensive and an even more devastating defeat for the Communists.""Full Metal Jacket"" is a monumental film in the classic Kubrick style and even if Kubrick meant the film to be anti-war and anti-military, it is in truth a tribute to those who served their country during a time of war when the majority of that generation sided with the enemy, refused to serve, rioted in the streets and campuses and denigrated, disparaged, and ridiculed those who answered the call of duty."
dougdoepke,"Jan 6, 2014",N/A,"Unfortunately, Metal Jacket shows the brilliant Kubrick in decline, and a long way from his anti-war masterpiece Paths of Glory (1958). All in all, and despite some telling episodes, this 2-hours adds up to a rather pointless exercise in wartime experience. Certainly, the first half is undeniable in its powerful expose of Marine Basic Training and the dehumanizing effect. At the same time, contrasting its honest depiction of combat training with the heavily sanitized depictions from such 1950's counterparts as Take the High Ground (1953) or Battle Cry (1955) shows how much truth-telling in the movie industry movie had improved in 30-years. Still and all, the movie halves do not match up well.I see the problem as lying with a script, and its inability to etch its characters strongly enough (excepting the ill-fated Ermey and Pyle) to bridge the gap and pull us into their battlefield predicament. At the same time, we only get a sporadic picture of the one continuing character, Private Joker (Modine). Perhaps, the best Vietnam part is listening to how the head of Stars and Stripes skews journalistic coverage in a propagandistic direction. So, it wasn't just folks at home being misled by their media, but troops in the field by theirs, as well. Anyway, the visuals are hellish in their fiery depiction of the battle for Hue. Then too, it comes as a real surprise that the sniper is a woman, the embodiment, I guess, of what the North meant by their motto ""People's War"". Looks to me, also, that Kubrick and co. had little idea of how to end the 2-hours. So we get a strident male chorus of a children's song, no less, as the platoon stumbles through a twilight world. Whatever else, that imagery does manage to symbolize the war in general.All in all, however, the movie suffers in comparison to such other Vietnam flicks as Platoon (1986) or Apocalypse Now (1979). Too bad Kubrick wasn't 20-years younger when he made this two films in one."
Marx_Bros_Fan86,"Sep 7, 2009",7/10,"Kubrick's Vietnam War film is a study of the human condition, specifically the soldier's human condition, during basic training and war time. There is not much commentary on the justification of the Vietnam War, only an examination of what war does to the mind. There is a scene where an officer asks Private Joker why he wrote ""Born to Kill"" on his helmet if he wears a peace sign on his shirt. Joker replies ""I don't know. It has something to do with the duality of man,"" or something to that effect. The whole movie is about the duality of man; everybody wants there to be peace, but when an authority figure tells us to kill, it becomes natural. For this, Full Metal Jacket is a thought provoking experience.The first forty minutes of Full Metal Jacket follows a group of Marine trainees on Paris Island who want to serve in Vietnam. We meet our main character, Private Joker, but the first act is dominated by two performers, R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, and Private Leonard Lawrence, nicknamed ""Gomer Pyle,"" played by Vincent D'Onofrio. Hartman is the toughest Drill Instructor imaginable; he is on his soldier's butts about something all the time. Pyle, however, is a natural screw-up, it is hard to imagine how he even made it to Paris Island, and Hartman is always the harshest with him, because he has been trained to believe that the louder you bark at a soldier the sooner they will shape up. Instead, it has the opposite effect on Pyle; he becomes mentally disturbed during his training, probably because he was never mentally fit to be a soldier in the first place. This segment typically receives the most praise; it is certainly easier to enjoy, because it progresses toward a natural conclusion, graduation day. Ermey also gives the best performance in the film, mainly because it was not a performance, as Ermey was a real Gunnery Sergeant. Almost all of his lines were ad-libbed. Sgt. Hartman is one of the most memorable characters in all of Kubrick's films.The rest of the movie does not really flow toward a natural ending; it just follows Private Joker on his daily exploits in Vietnam, and ends rather abruptly, making it harder to enjoy. The film's themes are exemplified in every scene, however. As a journalist, Private Joker has not been disturbed by actual combat, but he meets many others who have, particularly a soldier named Animal Mother. He cannot understand how soldiers can kill with such ease, but but he comes to understand in the final combat experience of the movie.Like all Kubrick movies, there is some good camera work here. I swear when people got shot in this movie I thought I had been shot too, especially during the sniper sequence. The only problem I have with FMJ, besides the disjointed quality of the second half, is that it never really feels like you are in Vietnam. The movie was filmed in England, and even though the sets were great, they still feel like sets. For these reasons, FMJ is the weakest of Kubrick's war movies (excluding Spartacus). It is still an intellectually stimulating experience that should not be missed if you like war films."
Aaron1375,"Jun 21, 2010",8/10,"I have to say I am not the biggest Kubrick fan. Not really against him or anything, but I have actually seen very few films by him. In fact, other than this one, the only other film of his I have seen is ""The Shining"" so of these two my experiences have been mostly positive. This film starts out great in my opinion with a well organized basic training section. You get to meet new recruits as they get their head shaved, then you get to see what a Marine has to go through to be a Marine and suffice to say there is no way I could do what they do. Not only do you have a crazed Sergent constantly yelling at you and demoralizing you, I just could not handle the sleeping quarters and all that comes with basic training as I have social anxiety problems so I most likely would try to get away or off myself. I would not do what the one guy does here though. The second half of the film is a bit weaker and not as strong plot wise as the first part. This may have been done on purpose as to depict the Vietnam war as disorganized and chaotic and if that is the case it is done well. Just not enough plot structure for my tastes in this section of the film, still good, it just can not quite rise to the level of the first portion of the film. The acting is even though throughout the movie so that helps in the rather uneven Vietnam section of the movie."
baileycrawly,"Dec 5, 2020",7/10,"I never really connected with the second part of this film. The first, however, will forever rank as one of the most entertaining Marine Corps training films ever released. Profane to a fault and unrelenting in its realism, Full Metal Jacket is an amazing film that, despite lacking in the latter half, held up well and is extremely enjoyable today."
thegrim9454,"Apr 26, 2013",3/10,"I went into this movie with no expectations, I had never seen any other Kubrick films before and I never allow myself to condemn or praise a movie before I have seen the entire thing. I was disappointed.Many people who just want to see a war flick will complain because of its slow points or lack of epic battles. While there could have been more action in a Vietnam war movie I wasn't complaining about the action.My main issue was with the storyline, in that there wasn't one. This movie is simply a portrayal of the war crimes that took place during the Vietnam war. It is a jumbled collection of ""Shock Shots"" and Kubrick's personal beliefs about the war. I honestly believe that this film has such good reviews is due to the Kubrick bandwagon. Since watching FMJ I have seen several other Kubrick movies, (Clockwork Orange and Eyes Wide Shut included) and I honestly have no idea how Kubrick became successful. His movies have very weak story lines and average technical quality. Sorry to step on Kubrick fans' feet, but his work is nothing special."
Rabbit-foot,"Feb 24, 2023",9/10,"I felt that this movie was divided into two parts, the first and second halves.In the first half, the story focuses on the boot camp training of the new recruits. They undergo harsh training from Sergeant Hartman, and the struggles of one recruit, Leonard, as he faces various challenges are particularly noteworthy. (Who could have expected that scene on the eve of graduation from training?)In the second half, the story shifts to the deployment of the newly trained soldiers to the battlefield. Unlike the first half, the characters who have been deployed into combat experience the horrors of war firsthand. The changes in the soldiers' hearts are well portrayed.The final scene is one that remains vividly in my memory among the many movies. It can be said that this movie is one of the excellent war movies."
rockrise,"Sep 3, 2021",10/10,The best. Best anti war film.kubrick as always.must watch film.
lovemichaeljordan,"Apr 26, 2023",8/10,"Had the entire film continued on the track of the first half, it would have perhaps been better. The first half is terribly cruel and funny. The second half is also great, but not as enjoyable. But something that makes this movie great is that it's like three movies in one. The movie explores so many themes. Spending the whole movie is base camp would not have been able to do this. It's a fantastic picture.The first half takes place in the base camp and the soldiers undergo training. The film starts out very funny (laughing out loud funny) and life in the navy looks great, but it quickly turns when a recruit goes crazy. Then the second half continues with misery and war.It's one of the greatest anti-war films. How hard should you push your recruits? You need your soldiers to be tough, but abusing them untill they become insane killing machines? Think how much time and energy goes into training these people and how talented each individual is. But no one can do anything alone, it is only together that they can do any good. War leads nowhere but death.Also good soundtrack which is so resoundingly important. A little Nancy Sinatra never hurts. This is a film that must be seen at some point. The film briefly touches on the dualism of man which is interesting."
avik-basu1889,"Nov 7, 2017",8/10,"One of the many characteristic aspects of Kubrick's cinema is the deliberate lack of humanity and intimacy. He made it a point to keep the viewer at a distance from the characters and the circumstances. 'Full Metal Jacket' is divided into two specific parts. The first part involving the basic training in the boot camp, benefits immensely from Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking. This first part is a brilliantly directed, shot and acted satire on the dehumanisation of young boys in the army. We see the innocent and honorable masculinity of these boys who want to do themselves, their families and their country proud, get replaced by toxic masculinity which involves killing your identity and your humanity, equating the lust for sex with the lust for violence, keeping all your emotions suppressed and in the end becoming ultra-aggressive, remorseless, animalistic killers. R. Lee Ermey pretty much single-handedly carries this first part of the film through sheer verbal aggression. The character of Sergeant Hartman played by Ermey is pretty much the devil just like the character of Terence Fletcher played by J. K. Simmons in 'Whiplash'. Just like great satire, there are numerous sequences and moments in this part where the audience will feel like laughing and then within a few seconds feel disturbed and disgusted for laughing at something terrible and reprehensible.While Kubrick's emotionally distant filmmaking is beneficial to the first part of the film, it actually to some extent becomes a weakness in the second part. In the second part, we move to Vietnam where we see the soldiers having to execute everything that they learnt in boot camp, at the real battlefield. Now there certainly are moments in this second half that I love like the sequence of the talking head interviews of the soldiers which further underline how pointless this war was and how clueless even the soldiers were about their missions and the general purpose of their temporary existence in Vietnam. I also especially loved the extended situational set- piece that the film ends with as it provides a devastating and perhaps a sorrowful conclusion to the arc of the character of Sergeant Joker played by Matthew Modine who for the major part of the film remains the voice of reason, logic and humanity. However apart from these aforementioned scenes, this second half of 'Full Metal Jacket' lacks a sense of cohesion. It feels like a random collection of vignettes, some of which aren't very interesting. The reason why some of the vignettes seem uninteresting is Kubrick's refusal to allow us into the mental state of the characters that are introduced in the second half or give us any insight into their psyches apart from some surface level behavioral tendencies. There are many scenes where we see the soldiers talk to each other and spend time together, but those scenes rang hollow to me and felt somewhat forced and artificial. This inability to completely appreciate the second half of the film on my part could be completely subjective. Since I loved the first half so much, maybe the change in setting and tone that takes place was always going to make it tough for the second half to measure up when compared to the first.Technically 'Full Metal Jacket' isn't as showy and attention grabbing as some of Kubrick's other films, however it still retains a lot of his characteristic visual touches like the use of one-point perspective and the use of steadicam,etc. The urban, ground level combat scenes are very well staged and directed. The production design has to be admired a lot for those scenes too. From an acting standpoint, I have already mentioned R. Lee Ermey for his brilliant performance. I think Matthew Modine and Vincent D'Onofrio deserve special mentions too for coming up with contrasting, yet equally compelling performances respectively.In conclusion, I'll say 'Full Metal Jacket' doesn't quite achieve greatness due to the flawed second half of the film. But it's still an exceptionally good movie that comes close to greatness due to the incredibly brilliant first half which I think is as good and as powerful as anything Kubrick has ever done in a visceral scene. It's a film that can be directly connected to 'Paths of Glory' and 'Dr. Strangelove' in terms of Kubrick's criticism of institutional authority, dogmatic patriotism and toxic masculinity. It's most certainly worth recommending."
Tweetienator,"Dec 3, 2020",8/10,"Kubrick's contribution to the movies about the war in Vietnam belongs for sure to the best, and R. Lee Ermey as Gny. Sgt. Hartman is one of those characters you will never forget. Full Metal Jacket - one of those movies that are essential to the genre. Still top."
Mr-Dahman,"May 4, 2020",8/10,"It's not only about the war but also about the duality of mankind , by watching the movie you ended up with a weird mixed up feeling"
ebiros2,"Dec 26, 2012",7/10,"I was too young to be in Viet Nam, but from the comments that I hear about this movie from those who were there, this movie has realism that still affects them emotionally.This is probably the best role Mathew Modine has played up to that point. Not all the soldiers were like soldiers in this movie but I guess that's what the reality of it was at the time. The dichotomy or what didn't make sense was why did mostly middle class Americans have to be sent into this brutal war, that United States had no moral reasons to be involved.The part that was most memorable was the scene where a Viet Namese sniper took out an American soldier. One second you're alive, next second you're dead. I could see why you could be psychologically distressed after seeing something like that.To me many of the things that happens in this movie didn't make much sense. I guess you had to be there to understand it. The movie had a mood like no other movie I've seen. Whether it was a good movie or not is beyond me to judge, but it was produced well, and the acting was decent.How this movie appears to you probably depends on your experience."
Hughmyerz,"Jul 21, 2025",8/10,Really great movie it's one of those legendary movies that will live on and forever be entertaining thrilling and a movie you watch even as the years go on. It's a tale of 2 halves with the first half of the movie being amazing pure entertainment it was brutal hilarious and chilling sort of a psychological nightmare during training to groom killers for war pure cinema and the performances were absolutely amazing both R Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio delivered award winning iconic legendary performances the only knock is it got a lil bit slow in the start of the second half it was still brutal seeing the tragedy of war but it didn't have the same juice but it picked up and the ending was cinematic and very satisfying Kubrick doesn't miss i rate it a 8.4 out of 10 officially.
joonakoskela,"Mar 20, 2020",7/10,It isn't the best movie ever but still really thrilling to watch and of course its made by Stanley Kubrick so of course its good! I don't usually watch military movies but this was good!
raysiddiqi,"Mar 27, 2024",2/10,"Kubrick failed to deliver a coherent or intriguing story with this film. I had watched the boot camp half twice and shut it off when they got to Vietnam. I couldn't stand the dehumanizing prostitute portrayal with the gratuitous ""these boots are made for walking"" needle drop. I finally gave the second half a try and all I can say is it was an absolute mess. It dehumanized and dishonored both sides of the conflict and constantly yelled its very basic message at you in the most ridiculous way. All the songs were completely unnecessary, the dialogue was unbelievable, the combat unrealistic, and it utterly failed as an anti-war movie. The ending with the female VC slowly dying and them singing Mickey Mouse was the most ham-fisted thing I've seen in any war film. It doesn't work as a satire either. Of course the drill sergeant did an excellent job and the basic training sequence was somewhat passable, however the latrine scene is where the movie fell off a cliff. It would've been much better for the story if they had private pile go crazy in Vietnam."
B-Seide24,"May 11, 2010",10/10,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time. Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job of creating an aggressive beginning to the movie. The constant abuse of Gomer Pyle by Sergeant Hartman felt real and the versimilitude in the movie was frightening. The film also carried some of the greatest scenes in history. The scene between Pyle and Joker which awoke Sgt. Hartman was intense,raw and the words ""Full metal jacket"" will forever ring in the back of my mind. It also opened the eyes to the world of what an abusive drill instructor could do and what it could lead you to do.The other scene that was horrifying and the realism of the hazing of Pyle was as if you were there witnessing as a bystander. Kubrick did a terrific job of filming that scene and showing you the angst of Joker as he reluctantly gets in on the action. I feel like Stanley Kubrick attempted and completed in showing you what the Vietnam war could do to a average normal person and the aftermath of what a war like that could do."
barrylyndondelarge,"Dec 15, 1999",10/10,"Ok, Apocalypse Now is the best Vietnam war film ever made, Platoon is the most realistic, but Full Metal Jacket is the smartest, most symbolic, and ingenious anti-war film ever. And if you don't get it, and you cant recognize the overwhelming vision of one of the greatest artists of the 20th century, then go see Saving Private Ryan, give it a 10 out of 10, and look at yourself in the mirror knowing that you don't have any taste in quality films whatsoever."
MrGorlami,"Jul 11, 2025",9/10,"It's rare to find a war film that's so clearly divided into two halves, each delivering a completely different experience - yet both equally powerful.The first half, set in boot camp, is intense, sharp, and full of psychological pressure. The story is gripping, the dialogues are razor-sharp, and the pacing keeps you on edge. The drill sergeant gives one of the most commanding performances I've seen in any war film. He doesn't just play a tough military figure - he becomes the embodiment of control, fear, and the mental breakdown that follows. Every line he delivers feels like a punch.Then comes the second half, set in Vietnam, and it shifts tone completely. The energy slows down, but the visuals take over. The cinematography and direction are absolutely stunning. The use of color, lighting, and composition turns every frame into a visual statement. You don't need much dialogue here - the mood, the tension, the chaos are all communicated through the camera. It's haunting and cold in the most artistic way.What I respect most about this film is that it's not trying to glorify war, nor is it trying too hard to be anti-war. It just shows it - raw, unfiltered, and deeply psychological.I give it a 9/10.One half satisfied me with story, intensity, and dialogue - the other with visuals, atmosphere, and direction.It's a film that balances brutality with beauty, and order with madness."
oisinsimpson,"Mar 16, 2020",9/10,A must watch and another masterpiece by Kubrick. Great performances by R Lee Erney as the drill sergeant. This film can is very deep but is hilarious at times truly a great film which feels like two parts
yuenw003,"Jul 19, 2017",10/10,"It is said that 90% of directing is casting. That is just part of Kubrick's genius. Another part of his genius is for capturing the right setting and ambiance. This movie has two part: first half is the boot camp drama with R. Lee Ermey (Sgt Hartman), the marine drill instructor, Matthew Modine (Prvt J.T. 'Joker' Davis) as the intelligent, aspiring combat reporter, and Vincent D'Onofrino (Prvt Leonard 'Gomer Pyle' Leonard) as the overweight, whipping boy of Sgt Hartman. The drama revolves around Pyle, as Sgt Hartman finds pleasure in belittling his screw ups in front of the others. Joker is paired up with Pyle to be his teacher and mentor. This part of the movie describes the dehumanization process a marine endures in basic training as preparation for them to be fashioned into a weapon of war. The second part is the recruits in the battle field. Joker's assignment as a reporter allows him to view the war experience from an audience's point-of- view. Eventually Pyle tags along with Prvt Cowboy's unit (a fellow recruit) as they patrol the ruins of the city of Hue following an attack known as the Tet Offensive. Towards the climax, 2 of Cowboy's men get picked off by an unknown sniper. This represents the hidden death that lurks at every moment during that war when battling guerrilla fighters. Finally at sundown, Joker leads some men to a building where the sniper is positioned. The palm trees and fire in the ruins of the city makes for an eerie, oriental temple like atmosphere. The music (like elephant cries) in the background also contributes to this effect. Finally the sniper is found and wounded. It turns out to be a girl. Badly wounded, she prays and then asks the men to mercifully killed her. Animal Mother, a heavy machine gunner (like Rambo), wants her to suffer to death as payback. Joker, on the other hand, compassionately chooses to put her out of her misery. The segment of the movie with the sniper is Kubrick's commentary on that war. The Vietnam war was sold to the Americans and those who fought it as the U.S.'s answer to help liberate that country from communism. Ironically, it was reduced to a frustrating effort on the part of young recruits to fight an invisible enemy who very much hated them for their presence in their country."
fergusonchip,"Nov 14, 2002",7/10,"Do yourself a favor, after they leave boot camp turn the movie off.  The actual battle scenes cover territory that is much more effectively covered elsewhere (e.g., ""All Quiet on the Western Front"").  The first half of the movie, however, ranks up there with the best of them.  The drill sergeant in this movie puts Louis Gossett, Jr.'s character in ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" to shame."
tankace,"Jul 6, 2016",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket is the third war movie that Kubrik directed and in my opinion is also the best for it shows the madness that is the essence of modern warfare ,in which the valleys of our society are thrown out the widow and are replaced with a system in which the humanity is worthless. I personally like very much for it is a lot of over the top moments, gruesome fights and a great criticism of the War in Vietnam and the war in general.The flick start with the new marines been trained in order to be fit for service. The training as you will see is made in order to kill the civilized and made these young men, killers and spoiler if you don't fit you ain't worth a s**t. The scene steal the nut job sergeant played by the real life sergeant Ronald Lee Ermey ,who is also the sergeant in Toy Story ,true story (:))!The second part of the movie is in Vietnam in which the devastation is more or less a mandating thing and the soldiers there seem to be calm in a alarming level. For Christ sake they sing ""Micky Mouse"" while marching with casualties of war left and right!!! In short the movie shows with a brutal way that human aren't meant to be in War, for in War we go mad and nothing is holy then.In short you should watch, if you haven't already' for it is a landmark of cinema and a blush of flick in general. Have a good time!"

wjfyysvhx,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"Kubrick's direction is meticulous, capturing the stark realities of warfare and the disillusionment that soldiers face. The cinematography is striking, using both wide shots of the battlefield and intimate close-ups to convey the emotional weight of the story. The film's iconic soundtrack, featuring tracks from the era, further enhances the atmosphere.""Full Metal Jacket"" is notable for its thought-provoking commentary on war and the human experience. It doesn't glorify combat; rather, it presents it as a brutal and often senseless endeavor. The performances, particularly by Ermey and Modine, are powerful and memorable.Overall, ""Full Metal Jacket"" stands as one of Kubrick's most significant works, highlighting the psychological and physical challenges faced by soldiers while forcing viewers to confront the harsh realities of war. It remains a controversial and impactful film that sparks discussions about the Vietnam War and the nature of military service."
RM851222,"Jul 10, 2016",9/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987) is definitely one the best Vietnam war (anti-war actually) movies ever made, although it's not one of my favorites. Maestro Stanley Kubrick created this movie in two very different parts - preparation for a war, and war itself but both of them features people in a ""world of shix"", as one character puts it.This is a splendid movie from the get-go, and after seeing this movie for the 3rd time, now i don't even know which part is better, probably the first, with unforgettable and jaw-dropping performances by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. Second shows war itself, and it is a stunning movie making in every frame - watch this movie on biggest screen possible, some scenes were soldiers move trough a bombed remains of a city are so haunting in it's realism.Overall, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a true movie classic, and i can see why. It's Kubrick's movie written all over it, with long shots were characters act and talk like only in a movies by Stanley Kubrick, always plausible, but with that rare detachment and absolute observation feeling which you can only feel watching this movie genius pictures. This is a great, unforgettable movie - not my favorite from Kubrick, but a superb experience nevertheless."

Abdulxoxo,"Aug 18, 2024",8/10,"The movie opens with an intense portrayal of Marine boot camp, where we follow a group of recruits under the brutal command of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, played with relentless vigor by R. Lee Ermey. This part of the film is an exceptional display of Kubrick's directorial prowess, offering a gripping look at the dehumanizing process of turning young men into soldiers.The boot camp sequence stands out for its raw intensity and dark humor. The performances are outstanding, particularly Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Pyle, whose tragic arc is both heartbreaking and haunting. The relentless drill sergeant and the transformation of the recruits are captivating, making this segment one of the most memorable in war film history. It's a masterclass in tension and character development, leaving me thoroughly engaged and invested in the characters' fates.However, as the film transitions to the Vietnam War frontlines in its second half, it loses some of the initial impact. The narrative becomes more familiar, with scenes that feel like they echo other Vietnam War movies. The pacing slows, and the film starts to feel like a standard war story rather than the unique experience promised at the beginning.Despite this, the film redeems itself with the climactic sniper sequence towards the end. The tension and suspense in this scene are palpable,
The cinematography throughout the film is impeccable, capturing both the harshness of the boot camp and the chaos of the battlefield. The soundtrack, featuring a mix of 1960s hits, adds an ironic contrast to the violence and chaos, enhancing the film's impact.In conclusion, this is a film of two halves, with the first half offering an unparalleled depiction of military indoctrination and the second half presenting a more conventional war narrative. While the latter part doesn't quite match the brilliance of the opening, it still provides moments of tension and drama, particularly in the sniper showdown."

I did not like this part of the film nearly as much as the first for many reasons. First of all, there was a feeling to the first part that just doesn't seem like it was there in the second part. I really felt for the characters during the training, but when they were fighting I felt less attached to them. Most of this part of the film is the men hiding behind walls and getting shot. While it is interesting, I felt that I had had enough after a little while. There is one very good part to me, when the men are being interviewed by a documentary crew. You get to see how different people saw the war, and it seemed to remind me of the dehumanization process the war brings as well as some comedy from some things the men said when answering the questions.7/10."
hwesaj,"Dec 23, 2024",10/10,"Like Stanley Kubrick, and I love his films, especially 2001, Barry Lyndon, Paths of Glory, Dr Strangelove and this, his penultimate film. Full Metal Jacket is a harrowing, violent and foul-mouthed film, yet it is superbly done. True, one or two parts may lack tropical realism, but the atmosphere the film creates is extraordinary. The film looks excellent with skillful cinematography. The script is very well crafted and does have a sense of realism, while the story is compelling with the transition from the training at the camp to the bombed Vietamnesse city smoothly done. I am with those who thinks the first half is better than the second, but that is not to say the second half isn't good, it is more than good, but the first half really was outstanding. Kubrick's direction as always is superb, as is the acting especially Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio. All in all, one of Kubrick's best and one of the best war movies you will see. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
malvolio7,"Jun 5, 2006",9/10,"Watching this movie, try substituting the Vietnam era soldiers, with modern day weapons, vehicles and grunts and you get the War in Iraq! This movie was very entertaining and not like the other Vietnam movies of the time (Apocolipse Now comes to mind) where it is all dark and moody (thanks to the Doors music), but this one has humor to lighten the situation, but there is gore. It is war, duh! Also having draftees in a war situation vs. troops who volunteer for such an assignment really shows. Of course no one wants to be in a war, but if you have to be there, you have to have your head screwed on tight, but not too tight, or you snap. Excellent movie."
buckeyefanohiostate,"Jan 20, 2022",9/10,"I love this movie it really feels like it was shot during the war! The drill instructor is played perfectly by Lee Ermey who was a real drill instructor (sorry can't spell) and the insults he yells at the recruits is some of the best and funniest lines ever uttered by an actor ever!!! There are so many great scenes too many to list well and I don't want to spoil any of it for ppl who haven't seen this movie yet!! This is by far one of the top 3 movies by one of the greatest directors of our time!!! You can tell by watching this movie Stanly really cared about how the movie was shot, the message ect."
reddiemurf81,"Jul 23, 2022",7/10,"Kubrick's harsh look at the effects the Vietnam War had on the young men who went to fight it.First, we see a group of Marine recruits go through basic training. 2nd, we see some of those recruits (now Marines) in the thick of the Vietnam War.R. Lee Emory!! Who better to play a drill sargent than an actor who was a drill sargent,, right?!? I wonder how much of his dialogue he came up with himself.The rest of the cast includes, but is not limited to, actors Matthew Modine, Adam Baldwin, and Vincent D'nofrio (who shows his ability to play tortured characters well).Overall I'd give this a 7.2 rating. Not a fun movie to watch, but a definite watch for wartime binge."
Nick_Dets,"Jul 3, 2003",N/A,"The first ten minutes of ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a disturbing, yet hilariously funny scene where a DI meets his new recruits.  Everything that comes out of his mouth in this scene is quoteable, classic obscenity.  What is truly haunting about this, however, is the transformation of the men in the marine corps.  Any other film would have followed the ""end of innocence"" cliche, but Kubrick makes sure that the audience knows there was little innocence to begin with in a confused, immoral war like Vietnam.  These boys are transformed into stone cold killers.  Robots, working for a cause they didn't care about.  In fact, one scene shows the DI instructing them to become as good as marksmen as Oswald!  Many of the men encountered in this film want nothing more than to kill as many Vietnameise as possible, horrifyingly enough, even if it means women and children.There is an unforgettable closing shot where all of the soldiers march on after a gruesome battle proudly chanting the Mickey Mouse theme.  In this harrowing, Kubrick-trademark close, Mickey Mouse becomes a metaphor for this sole attitude of Vietnam.  The great wars were over and these all-American boys had no intention of making any peace.Matthew Modine plays the lead, Private Joker.  He is brilliant as the faceless everyman of the Marine Corps.  Private Joker is to the brutality of vietnam just as Alex Delarge is to a society infatuated with sex in violence.  His helmet reads ""Born to Kill"", yet he wears a peace symbol to display the ""duality of man"".  He is very symbolic of how lost everything seemed to get.  We follow him through the three sections of the film, all conveying the horrors of 'nam.  The first act is boot camp in an opening that is ultimately unforgettable.  Here it is more than clear that there was a reduction in the vulnerable young men entering the corps.  Private Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Nofrio)is a fat, very dumb recruit whose screw-ups make him victim to the DI and his fellow soldiers.  The second fearlessly, unflinchingly shows the dehumanization of the Vietnamese people. Private Joker becomes a combat journalist, feeding his fellow soldiers lies so they keep their heads in the game.  He is assigned to a platoon where he faces action, which leads into the third act...the reality of combat.Stanely Kubrick made one of the best way films of all time.  His capability to tackle controversial issues made him perfect for a  Vietnam story.  This is not a film defending the war, it is a film exposing a reality that was lost like the whole purpose of the war was."
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 21, 2011",6/10,"Kubrick's dark and unflinching take on the Vietnam War is as hard to stomach as the nature of America's doomed conflict. It's a film split into two halves, with the first undoubtedly the stronger, depicting the dehumanisation of green recruits as they come under the command of a drill sergeant from hell – a perfectly cast R. Lee Ermey, who dined out on his performance here for many years to come (and deservedly so). The second and longer half of the film follows the troops as they engage in a bloody and brutal conflict which culminates in a show-stopping climax.The film boasts strong performances, particularly Vincent D'Onofrio as the chubby recruit whose good nature is eroded by his brutal treatment at the hands of both Ermey and his fellow conscripts. Kubrick's style is almost unnoticeable as he delivers a documentary-style movie that focuses on intense dialogue and harsh situations rather than pyrotechnics and explosive battle scenes. While this doesn't add much to the war that we didn't already know about (the '80s was crowded with films like this, PLATOON and HAMBURGER HILL) it proves a strong addition to the director's filmography."
cheryllawrence-41883,"Jul 24, 2018",8/10,"Stanley Kubrick was already a legend when he made Full Metal Jacket- a war movie. The film is divided into two parts. The first focuses on a bunch of new recruits in boot camp and the other takes place smack in the middle of a warzone. Full of images that stick in mind and some great use of music Full Metal Jacket is Kubrick through and through. From the long takes to the nihilistic overtones there is a stamp of authority of the master filmmaker. The acting, as is the case with every Kubrick film is sublime especially Mathew Modine and Vincent D' Onofrio. If you want to see an auteur at work Full Metal Jacket is a film you should check out."
lovesfilms547,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is a widely beloved film that has also garnered much negative criticism, which frankly I do not understand. I only find pleasure in this great war movie, whether it be during the open boot-camp segment or from the actual war portion of the film. It tugs at your emotions and has some truly wonderful and quotable lines."
jarredflatmore,"Dec 5, 2023",10/10,"""Full Metal Jacket,"" stands as a cinematic triumph that skillfully navigates the grim realities of war with both raw intensity and profound insight. The film, divided into two compelling acts, seamlessly weaves together a narrative that is as thought-provoking as it is visually arresting.The first half of the movie is a tour de force in itself, immersing viewers in the relentless crucible of Marine Corps boot camp. R. Lee Ermey's portrayal of the unyielding drill instructor is nothing short of iconic, delivering a performance that is both terrifying and captivating. Kubrick's meticulous attention to detail in depicting the rigorous training process not only adds authenticity but also sets the stage for the emotional journey that follows.As the narrative transitions to the harsh landscapes of the Vietnam War, ""Full Metal Jacket"" continues to excel in its portrayal of the psychological toll of combat. The film follows Private Joker, portrayed with nuance by Matthew Modine, as he evolves from a wide-eyed recruit to a war correspondent. The transformation of the characters serves as a poignant commentary on the dehumanizing effects of war, prompting reflection on the profound impact it has on those who experience it.Kubrick's masterful direction is evident throughout, with every frame meticulously composed to evoke a range of emotions. The cinematography captures the brutality of war with unflinching precision, while the juxtaposition of dark humor against the backdrop of chaos adds layers of complexity to the storytelling. The result is a film that is as visually arresting as it is thematically rich.Furthermore, the soundtrack, featuring a mix of iconic tracks, complements the film's atmosphere, enhancing the emotional resonance of key moments. The carefully curated music contributes to the immersive experience, leaving a lasting impression on the audience.In conclusion, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a cinematic tour de force that not only stands as a testament to Stanley Kubrick's directorial prowess but also as a poignant exploration of the human psyche in the face of the brutality of war. With its stellar performances, striking visuals, and thematic depth, the film remains a powerful and enduring work of art that continues to resonate with audiences, cementing its place as a classic in the war film genre."
Emerenciano,"May 28, 2006",N/A,"No doubt Stanley Kubrick is one of the best directors cinema has ever known. In his life, he made things like ""Spartacus"", an excellent gladiator, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"", a wonderful sci-fi film, ""Lolita"", a sexy and hot romance, ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"", an ironical masterpiece, ""A Clockwork Orange"", a portrait of a possible future and this ""Full Metal Jacket"", considered by many the best war movie ever made.The film seems to be two different movies put into one. The first part shows the privates training in an island in the USA. Commanded by a brave, and sometimes cruel, man, the soldiers are often called ""maggots"" and they have to face really hard exercises. Some of them, like private Pyle, suffer from the pains and difficulties of their duties.The second part is the war itself in Vietnam. Through the eyes of Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who writes to the press about the situation in the battlefield, we see the war from a very true point of view. We feel like we are there in the platoon and sometimes and have the feeling we are soldiers ourselves.Highly recommended."
deickos,"Mar 16, 2023",6/10,"When Vietnam is the theme one starts comparing the films with one another. This is a revealing process in storytelling and in character creating. Not everyone is sincere - the trained eye is looking for inconsistencies that betray those who aim to impress while in fact are irrelevant and manipulating. It is not enough to maintain an anti-war stance - personal involvement is required when ideas are expressed and ideals are aimed. There is no doubt there are thousands untold stories about this era but on my knowledge only one film was ambitious enough to look higher, and it was not this one. In this case there is a story to be told but it is not as strong and convincing."
emasterslake,"May 2, 2006",8/10,"This is another good movie done by Kubrick.Full Metal Jacket is taken place when the Vietnam War was still at large.The first half of the movie shows you how much stress and pressure the marines are put through at the training camps.Inclduing the drill Sergent pushing around Piles the fat guy which did made me laugh a lot.The second half show you some action in Vietnam. Plenty of violence and shooting to be seen. Really education for those who want to know what the war was like.If you like war movies or any of Kubrick's films, you'll enjoy this title. It is indeed one of best war movies of the 20th Century."
torq,"Apr 20, 2001",7/10,"This is actually not so much one movie as two short movies which happen to share a protagonist.  The first part, showing ""Private Joker"" in boot camp, is excellent.  The second part is Just Another Angst-Ridden Vietnam War Movie and is not really worth watching unless you feel some neurotic compulsion to see every ARVWM ever made.10 for the first segment, 4 for the second."
Phoenix_from_the_ashes,"Feb 5, 2021",1/10,"What a super boring non story with characters that make you feel nothing. The training part is overrated. Half of the war experience is partying with prostitutes, the other half looking robotically at a couple of people dying. Whoever is left at the end has managed to retain all their limbs. It's a little boy's depiction of how little boys play the war game."
full_meddle_jacket,"Mar 16, 2002",10/10,"With a hole-proof script by a brilliant director (Stanley Kubrick) and two veteran soldiers and writers (Michael Herr and Gustav Hasford), it is no doubt that the product they would create would be flawless. ""Full Metal Jacket"" was crafted to sheer unglorified perfection. Its vivid portrayal of life in the hell of a 1960's bootcamp and to the grizzly life of Vietnam in the 1968 Tet Offensive is one that looks right in the eyes of the unaware naive viewer and dares them to look deeper. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is a classic in its own right, not because of what it attempts to be, but because of what it doesn't: the film does not try to glorify war with long speeches and cliched roles praising ""good guys killing the enemy."" If there was ever a movie that paid meticulous attention to every crescendo and decrescendo of its environment, then this is it: ""Full Metal Jacket"" is both full of careful detail and spontaneous genius. Probably the best, and only decent, film of the 1980's Vietnam War backlash."

averroes111,"Jun 14, 2000",10/10,"I'm a big fan of Kubrick.  His movies tend to have subtexts that are not readily apparent.A theme he keeps revisiting in his films is that of entropy, or the way a system can break down.  Witness HAL in 2001: A Space Oddyssey, and the ""military/political system"" in Dr. Strangelove.  It takes but a small thing to set destruction in motion.This one is similar, where the tightly regimented robot soldiers leave the camp all clean cut and organized, but later the story trails off into a non-standard, open and disarrayed ending that parallels the reality of the lack of closure such things have in real life.  Stories are ususally handed to us in nice, digestable packets, but the narrative here falls apart just like the military unit does.I think it is intentional."
austinleube,"Feb 15, 2025",10/10,"Full metal jacket is widely regarded as a great and classic movie. Other than the shining, full metal jacket is one of if not the most popular Kubrick film. I think this movie is the best movie of all time. A lot of people love the first section of the movie and are indifferent to the second half. I for one agree that the first segment is better but both segments are masterpieces. Many people feel indifferent to the second segment because there is basically no closure to what happens at the end of the first. I think that this is a good thing and that this makes the movie better by making the idea still be in the back of your mind while watching. Overall full metal jacket is the best movie in my opinion and you should watch it."
thetruecell,"Sep 21, 2006",10/10,"It is rare that a film has nothing good to say about war. Though there have been an increasing number of films in recent years that work to show the true savagery of battle, there is always a touch of honor and nobility presented as well. In fact, in many films the overall presentation is that while war may be brutal, it is from that very brutality that true heroes are born. Indeed, these portraits of war show that fact as almost a given.But this film, like Apocalypse Now, shows that sometimes there is no honor to be found in war, and that horror and inhumanity can often be the only true things to be found in battle. From the sadistic boot camp of R. Lee Ermey's Sgt. Hartman to the widespread death and destruction of the Tet offensive, Full Metal Jacket shows us that sometimes when we place ordinary men into combat situations, we do not get heroes but rather killers and sociopaths.Kubrick is often known for giving us thought provoking films, but this title may be considered Kubrick at his best. Observing it all alongside Matthew Modine's pragmatic Pvt. Joker, we are encouraged to ask ourselves: what honor, what nobility are we supposed to find here? For many viewers, the answer will be none. This is a film both horrible and powerful, and should be viewed by all. Especially those of us who view conflict as the best means of resolving crisis. It may cause you to rethink that position. I know it did so for me."
~PL~,"Feb 7, 2000",N/A,"Full Metal Jacket is the best war movie ever. Full Metal Jacket shows us how army can destroy people's minds. It starts in a military base where men are trained to become marines for the Viet-Nam war. One man, who is a bit fat, is hated by the colonel, who beats him and who discovers a donut in his box. He makes the others hate the guy and one night, the others (including Joker, his friend)beat him up. He is sad and then decides to get better in the marine training...and it works, but he then kills the colonel and himself...Then they go to the war and many things happen...this is a psychological film, more human than The Thin Red Line, and more dramatic than Saving Private Ryan. The actors were excellent too, but it seemed like the film was incomplete. Kubrick is the master, a god!!! See this film at all costs! I give it 89%."
soundoflight,"Nov 11, 2022",6/10,"To me, the ""big three"" (anti) Vietnam war films are:
1. Apocalypse Now
2. Platoon
3. Full Metal JacketAnd I rank them in that order, putting 'Full Metal Jacket' below the other two (and below several other well known Vietnam films for that matter). The main problem with 'Full Metal Jacket' is that it simply doesn't ring true on any level - it's obviously something that has been crafted and hammed up for the big screen, in order to convey certain messages, and that takes me right out of the film. This is basically Kubrick's style falling flat in this particular genre. Kubrick was always looking for non-realistic takes in his films (repeating takes over and over until he got the right one), which is what makes his great films great, but a war film needs to be something more visceral and real. In 'Apocalypse Now' you feel like you yourself are living on that boat. In 'Platoon,' you feel like you yourself are lost in the jungles. But in Kubrick's film, you are a passive observer, learning your lesson. This is not helped at all by the film almost being two short films back to back, each one being viewable in isolation without needing the other one. So 'Full Metal Jacket' becomes this stylized, outsiders take - a take from someone who obviously had nothing personally at all to do with Vietnam, and so instead of being from the viewpoint of a soldier, we get the viewpoint of a journalist, someone on the outside, looking in.It's certainly worth viewing, but for me I actually like it less and less each time I try to watch it, which is the opposite of most Kubrick films for me."
smittynlinda,"Dec 17, 2011",5/10,"This is a good action movie, as a former Marine I've watched it a couple of times. Lee Emery the SDI, had the filthiest, gutter, sewer pipe mouth I'd ever heard. I went through Marine Corps boot camp, 1959, Plt. 344, All Colorado platoon. I, and it's been a few years ago, do not ever recall any of our DI's using the F word. They did use a few ""cuss words"" but not just filth for the sake of filth. The routine regarding, ""this is my rifle, this is my gun, etc."" We did have that, our DI's were way to disciplined and respectful to have us running around in our Quonset Hut holding our privates in one hand. Some may remember 3rdBn. at San Diego, were berthed in quonset huts just across from the confidence course, 1st and 2nd in hotels next to the grinder. There has always been a bit of a ""tiff"" among the Hollywood Marines and those at PI. The only difference I seen or found out later when I went to Camp Lejeune after boot camp, was the humidity and swamps in that part of the country. Being a native of Colorado, I'd never experience such high humidity, and it takes some getting used to. A DI's a DI, East or West coast."
mattflohr,"Sep 8, 2023",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war films ever made. It might be my favourite Kubrick film as well. It shows the dehumanizing effects of war, war as a thing man has created which he cannot control, that then changes decent men into something different, something a bit sinister. Moral corruption seems to be the norm just in the general tone of the way the characters talk to each other. It feels like everyone has accepted their new identities as ""maggots"" even though they're also supposed to be marines. The whole training section shows how one can easily be psychologically broken down and remolded into a weapon for someone else to use. Human life ceases to have any value in such an environment and we see this then play out on the battlefield. But we see the same sorts of behaviours in all sort of religious cults that we call crazy. I'm not saying all soldiers are like this, many are good honorable men but the general mentality of modern militaries and warfare is anything but modern or humanistic. Vietnam saw a visible change in the mentalities of soldiers from what is generally seen and talked about in World War II studies. The men who served in that war seemed to have a sense of heroism about them, as well as the men who commanded them. But the whole tone of Vietnam was different. They counted successes in bodycounts. Pounds of ordinance dropped. Sometimes indiscriminate killing. The commanders in charge are largely responsible. But part of America was lost during Vietnam and never seemed to return. This is echoed wonderfully in how this film ends, with a frightening glimpse into the abyss that is the heart of man, the total and complete loss of a soul and the beginning of a true thousand-yard stare. The key thing though is Hartman and R. Lee Ermey's performance. He's incredibly funny and quotable. He's so wild that you almost don't realize what's actually happening in subtext, it's very easy to just be entertained by him. But his scenes have important things to say about brainwashing and manipulation that we should all take to heart. He sets the stage and tone for everything that happens with the soldiers psychologically. Their own lives cease to matter too as they become more and more attuned to the ""death drive"". Joker talks about the Jungian duality of man even as his own duality remains hidden to him. His Shadow denied even as it lurks behind him. We all need to integrate with that shadow at some point, and we can find truth. Peace and love and darkness all in harmony."

RatedVforVinny,"Apr 24, 2020",10/10,"I have only find one fault in this truly brilliant War Movie (by the maestro himself) Stanley Kubrick but thankfully it does not detract form the magnificence of both the acting performances and the tightest, most thrilling Direction. On one hand the part of Private Pile does not make too much sense, as I very much doubt someone so unsuitable and out of shape would ever be selected for the most torrid and physically demanding training to become a U.S Marine. Though stating this obvious plot ploy, he's also the most important character in the film. Rather than the construction of an elite fighting force, it simultaneously concerns the ultimate, deconstruction of any type of humanity (they once had). Lee Ermey (a real life drill instructor) is a real shock to the system and the rest of the cast is certainly up to the task. Also contains some highly realistic battle action, filmed in the Docklands (East London) and with a mind jolting ending scene, that will have you riveted to your chair! Terror, disbelief and the chilling horror of 'Nam'. The musical score with the collection of songs and creepy synth music is pretty much unrivaled."
turtleloverules,"Jul 4, 2021",10/10,This awesome movie brought back memories from my military tours. R. Lee Ermey played the drill instructor roll perfectly!
doctrnoles,"Mar 11, 2001",N/A,"Full Metal Jacket works a lot better when it's much more subtle.  For example, the ""preparation"" for war via boot camp is so haunting, it makes the actual war look weaker by comparison.  The boot camp sequence is a ripe slice of hell, and the war is not really scary, but kind of goofy.  Does Kubrick see Vietnam as untidy?  I'm no historian but I think forests and humidity had to do with Vietnam.  All in all, this film is still really good, and should be watched by anyone interested in war movies.  As with Kubrick's other movies, the film is moody and introspective, and the boot camp sequence is ickier than other war movie sequences.  In my opinion, after the boot camp sequence, I though that Kubrick ran out of things to do. Rating: 7/10 (Kubrick's dead?  Somebody should tell him!)"
tmfplayer,"Sep 4, 2021",7/10,"The writing of the film was good but the directing of Kubrick was not great compared to the praise that is said about him, he is really an exaggerated director."

I have never seen such a highly polished work in recent works.And this masterpiece is very effective for depression. I have been suffering from terrible auditory hallucinations for the past few days, and when I couldn't do anything, I played the SpongeBob theme song in my head to endure it. However, after about ten minutes of watching this work, I felt like my heart had become lighter, and I was able to relax for the first time in a long time.I can't explain why this happened. But I think that a really well-made work of art has the effect of almost directly affecting human psychology.In that sense, I think this work is a true masterpiece."
grassman47,"Oct 1, 2022",7/10,"The first half of the film is a brilliantly filmed, brilliantly acted portrayal of the brutality and bullying of young recruits being readied to fight in Vietnam. It is, at times, genuinely shocking and the viewer gets very close to a particular group of rookies.The second half follows the same group as they enter the theatre of war. Unfortunately, all the combat action appears to take place on one, large, deserted industrial estate, with a few palm trees thrown in to try to create a sort of jungly feel to the action. The intimacy built up in the first half largely dissipates as clichéd action scenes draw the film to a close.Despite this, I would recommend this film for the power of the first half alone."
RonellSowes,"Jun 11, 2021",4/10,"As if he hadn't torched the military infrastructure enough in Paths of Glory and Doctor Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick returned to make another scathing film about war, this time set in the Vietnam War. Actually this film is set in two different places with one half taking place in the Marine Recruit Training. While there isn't as much shooting or killing, Kubrick still uses it as a means to display the dehumanizing nature of the military. It follows two characters primarily, one being the closest thing to a protagonist who the picture later follows through Vietnam and the other is the utterly incapable Pyle. The segment mainly shows how Pyle is grinded down by the demanding Drill Sargeant-played unforgettably by R Lee Emery-until he eventually snaps and kills him and himself. Where the storyline ends and the new one in Vietnam commences, but the same critical themes run unremitting. Though he may not be entirely wrong Kubrick's views are still fairly one sided and fail to see things from more than one angle.All politics aside this is also objectively one of his weaker films in terms of sheer quality. It lacks much of the intellect and artistry of some of his other films like Barry Lyndon and Doctor Strangelove as well as the entertainment value of Spartacus or The Shining. It's also rather blase for such a groundbreaking and visionary filmmaker as Stanley Kubrick. Not to mention Full Metal Jacket also failed to achieve its goal to an extent. The film was meant to disenfranchise people to military yet some viewers felt just the opposite-perhaps that's what Stanley was telling us?"
josephinemallorys,"Feb 13, 2019",10/10,"Unlike many other (Vietnam)war movies, the movie focuses in my opinion on the madness of man instead of the madness of war.The first half shows how the soldiers are being dehumanized during their military training by Gunnery Sergeant Hartman, a legendary and already classic role by R. Lee Ermey. The second half shows the madness of man in a war situation. Both of the halves are good and in a way can be seen as a movie alone but for some reason the two halves don't really flow into each other, which is my only real complaint I have about this fantastic and most certainly unique movie. Then the eternal question of which half is the better one? I'm one of the few who actually like the second half more as the first but that is just only personal and different for everyone.It's strange that the Vietnam battlefield looks more like a WWII European battlefield but I'm sure Kubrick had his reasons for it. Kubrick also manages to put many other weird and unique situations in the movie, which makes this movie truly an unusual viewing experience that shall leave quite an impression on you. Only a brilliant man such as Stanley Kubrick can come up with these kind of scene's.Despite the oddness level of the movie, the movie still manages to also impress the more casual viewer. The battle sequences are made with lot's of profession and with some beautiful cinematography and great use of music.The characters are good and typical Kubrick like. Many of the actors give the performance of their lives.Not the best Vietnam movie but certainly the most unique one. You'll love it long time."

It's not as violent as people say it is but it is still pretty dark and violent in some areas. Great cast for this film makes it golden. If you're an 80's baby which I wish I was you have probably seen it as a kid. Nothing can replace this Vietnam film as far as detail goes.
ciscokid1970,"Sep 27, 2006",9/10,"The most 're-watchable' movie that Kubrick ever made. It was also the least Kubrick-y movie that he made, in other words it does not have the signature color scenes, strange lighting, ultra odd characters or strange story twists.This movie made the career of Ron Ermey, he has so many on liner insults in this movie that you could fill a book with them. He fit the part so perfectly because he spent over 10 years in the Marine Corps. In fact this movie has been so watched that a true fan can mouth along with most of the insults. Ermey's part in this movie has made him immortal, he will be forever linked to this movie.The supporting cast was also excellent, this movie showed the rise of excellent actors such as Matthew Modine and especially Vincent D'Onofrio. D'Onofrio's part as Private Pyle should have won an Oscar, he nailed the part as a mentally challenged cadet that twisted to the dark side.This movie got snubbed at the Oscars, one factor could be that it was so dark and negative that many people were put off. Another thing was that 78 was the same year that The last emperor and Fatal attraction came out.The only reason this movie is not a perfect 10 is because of the non-climactic ending. I love Kubrick films but his endings have never been memorable, his films always peak at about 20min before the end of the film.My favorite line is ""I do not discriminate...to me you are all equally worthless"""
Petey-10,"Jan 14, 2000",N/A,"Full Metal Jacket is a movie about the war of Vietnam.There are two parts in this movie.The first part is about the tough training part and the second about the war itself.Many young men fight for their lifes in the war.One of them is private Joker,played by Matthew Modine.The late Stanley Kubrick made a great war film.He was a great film maker, a genius.Great movie from a great director. Vietnam can kill me, but it can't make me care."
Tera-Jones,"Jun 23, 2014",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the scariest war films to date - it is just as creepy as any well made horror film! This movie is not for the faint-of-heart! It is graphic in it's depiction but well made in the fact it defines the horrors of war without being too vulgar with it (which kept it from being an X-rated film).Outstanding performances from the entire cast, an excellent storyline and it's very much action-packed for those seeking thrilling war action.This is one of those ""must see"" films for movie connoisseurs.10/10"
bkkaz,"Apr 21, 2023",7/10,"Full Metal Jacket is more a collection of scenes than it is a movie. Ostensibly, it's two parts -- the basic training sequence and then the Vietnam sequence. I say ostensibly because even then it feels fragmented.This is one of those movies that traffics in European nihilism. That is, nothing that happens really means anything except to the people involved, and even then, they're essentially amoral. You know you're in meaningless territory when the most ethical person in the movie is the abusive drill sergeant, Hartman.His job is to make killers and weed out those whose humanity or hesitation would fail them and whatever mission they're on at the battlefield. So he drives them with the brutality of a high school football coach who thinks too highly of himself. He's funny in a psychotic way, spouting off the sorts of insults and racism that gaslighting abusers play off as jokes. But he's not joking. He's the product of the very system he keeps going, the sad irony that the sum total of his life is to be a self-replicating cog.Into this we meet Private Joker, played by pointy-faced, beady-eyed Matthew Modine. He's both a strength and weakness, his strength being his saturnine, overtall looks give him a kind of scarecrow -like presence, his weakness being he brings no real moral center to the film. His participation in helping turn a child-like screw up nicknamed Gomer Pyle (a terrific Vincent D'Onofrio) after a beatdown is never really addressed in the movie. It's just one of those ""Gee, bad things happen"" moments.And this ultimately is what brings Full Metal Jacket down. One could argue that in trying to imitate real life as seen by the people who made the film, random, horrible things happen even to good people. But then the artifice in how such much of the film is made -- with its kooky 60s novelty songs and flippant racism toward the Vietnamese -- constantly remind us this isn't reality but a production. Despite all the technical effort, it's a very 1980s movie, including how easily it denigrates anyone who isn't White while conveniently forgetting not only were the Americans invaders to the land, they lost and had to flee the country in ignominy.This is a movie you enjoy for its parts and not its total. If there's a message in Full Metal Jacket, it's that there is no message. And this doesn't make it bleak so much as irrelevant. Yes, when the movie is over, you'll be able to quote all sorts of lines and recall specific moments. But you won't be able to say what it's about."
orkunyasa,"May 5, 2019",10/10,I think it is the best war movie. The actors are great. People can feel the story.
gpoposki,"Aug 29, 2016",10/10,"Ah, another classic war movie. Luckily, this movie didn't get ransacked by critics.Besides that, Full Metal Jacket is an amazing movie, and after all this time has passed nothing has passed. An amazing story of what the Vietnam war looked like though a soldiers eyes. Action left and right, shots zooming past your ears, disputes between soldiers. Also, the writers of this movie didn't fear to be comedic at times. That is what most movies today are missing. Be it a drama or a war film. This movie replicated everything perfectly and is found it to be prefect.You definitely should give it a watch."
adeck14,"Apr 16, 2013",10/10,"WARNING: this review may contain spoilersFull Metal Jacket is by far one of my favorite war movies. This movie, in my opinion is very much anti-war. Upon entering boot camp, the soldiers are still normal in the sense that they have not been stripped of their individuality. However,as we see with Sgt. Hartman's statements like, ""You're not even human f-ing beings"" and ""you are all equally worthless,"" the marines are not made up of a group of individuals: they are a part of a mean, lean, fighting machine.To become a part of this machine, the soldier has to be dehumanized. As we see in the film, the soldiers are subject to strict, systematic instruction that is supposed to bring about a methodical obedience. In this context, even the most harmless of men can become ruthless killers. This says a lot about human nature in general: we use violence to survive, or obtain peace and security. While this may be the ultimate goal and purpose of the military and war, Full Metal Jacket does a great job at painting a very different picture.The soldiers leave boot camp ready to fight and kill. Raptor Man complains about not having to shoot his gun at all after 2 years of being in Vietnam. Other soldiers boast about how many kills they have had. It becomes clear that these soldiers are not fighting for honor, liberty, or whatever we are told by our government (at least in this context). They are doing what they are trained to do (or, as the logo says on Joker's helmet, ""Born to Kill""). They are trained to kill the enemy, and all Vietnamese are seen as the enemy. The Vietnamese are not seen as human beings, which is made apparent when the soldier in the helicopter shoots at innocent civilians. While I realize this is not the case for every soldier, it does coincide with the whole idea of ""war is hell."" This is the picture Stanley Kubrick is trying to paint for us: war is hell, seemingly normal men are capable of committing atrocities against other human beings, and this is all in the name ofwhat?I give this movie 10 out of 10. This movie is a must-see for fans of all genres. The acting, script, and cinematography is amazing!"
larrymoshier,"Aug 29, 2025",8/10,"As great as R. Lee Ermey's performance as the drill sergeant was, Vincent D'Onofrio gave an incredible Oscar worthy performance as Private Pyle. I'm very surprised that he wasn't at least nominated for lead actor in a supporting role. The scenes of his tortuous basic training are what most people remember most about this movie by far. Easily the best depiction of hardcore military basic training ever filmed. Hacksaw Ridge is another very good one, but this remains the gold standard, in large part because of D'Onofrio's performance."
EMC-2,"Oct 28, 1998",9/10,"This film is immensely popular among United States Marines.  This is perhaps ironic, considering the negative light in which Mr. Kubrick appears to portray us (if he was criticizing the USMC, that fact is lost on many jarheads).  R. Lee Ermy's portrayal of Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the most memorable performances in movie history, and includes one of the cinema's immortal lines:  ""What is your major malfunction?!""  The film becomes substantially less interesting when the setting moves to Vietnam. Nevertheless, some intense combat sequences make the film more than worth watching to the end.  Overall, ""Full Metal Jacket"" is another Kubrick jem."
mkellam-598-15918,"Dec 3, 2009",N/A,"This is arguably the best Vietman movie (and possibly the best real war movie) ever made. This is not a heroic or uplifting war movie, but I think many would agree that was should be none of these things nor be portrayed as such.I have vivid memories of this film. I saw this with my grandfather in the theater in 1987 (I was 15 and probably shouldn't have been allowed to see it). Even at that age, its clear depictions of the horrors of war and what it does to the main character and the rest involved in the story were powerful and sobering.BTW: For those who like this film, read The Things They Carried by Tim O'Brien (1990)"
JayPatton88,"Nov 19, 2019",6/10,"This movie does not stand a chance. Another movie about the conflict in Vietnam, but the plot and cast falls far short of my expectations because I watched the film ""Platoon"" first. Unlike ""Platoon"" , which I watch to this day, I watched this film once, and will never watch it again as I feel it's not worth my time."
Movie-12,"Jun 28, 2001",6/10,"FULL METAL JACKET / (1987) **1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:With Stanley Kubrick's ""Full Metal Jacket"" you get two masterfully constructed movies for the price of one-a movie about boot camp and a movie about Vietnam. Unfortunately, under most circumstances, neither film is worth viewing.It's shocking to watch the risks Kubrick takes with this material. From the opening shots, against a soundtrack featuring ""Goodbye Dolly, Hello Vietnam,"" images flash before our eyes of marine recruits getting their heads shaven clean for training camp. Cut to a rude, obnoxious, drill instructor, Sergeant Hartman (Lee Ermey), shouting curses at these young recruits as he passes down the double aisle of bunks at a basic training camp in Paris Island. ""From now on you'll speak only when spoken to, the first and last words out of your mouth will be sir!"" In this segment, we witness the agonizing training sessions and dills that these poor young men must conquer. Most of them do a fine job. All except for a moronic, uncoordinated maggot nicknamed Gomer Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio). The personalities of Hartman and Pyle clash like water and oil, or more like fire and propane.Little dialogue exists with in this personality conflict, but there sure is a hell of a lot of screaming and shouting of disgusting insults. I wanted relief from the Sergeant's nonstop obscenity and discrimination. Lee Ermey does wonderful things with his character, but the character is repulsive. He gave me a headache to the extent that I had to turn the movie off momentarily and walk outside to clear my mind and take a few deep breaths of fresh air.Considering a lot of Ermey's dialogue was improvised, I admire phrases like these. This kind of dialogue is great if you're looking for a hard-edged, realistic look at military training camps. But play that same kind of tone and dialogue for over forty-five minutes, then is it really entertaining? Engaging? If you answer yes, then I have just learned things about you I did not want to know.The second segment of ""Full Metal Jacket"" takes off when the trained military troops arrive in Vietnam. The movie then disintegrates into a series of detached, self contained war sequences. Most war movies, regardless of how disturbing or graphic, secure at least some rank within my emotions. ""Saving Private Ryan,"" ""Platoon,"" ""Apocalypse Now,"" and even ""Tigerland"" captured my heart in very different ways, but this movie feels detached to all humanity and spirit. There is nothing harrowing about scene after scene of hopeless characters getting shot to hell if we don't feel for those characters. Kubrick eliminates his only two interesting characters in the first segment, leaving his second segment to shrivel and die.Although I disliked the film, I admire many things about ""Full Metal Jacket."" The film's serious attitude towards its subjects. Kubrick's ironic message that people produce killers, and that killers are not born, reverses his own stance as seen in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Kubrick's style also shows through; the film's finale holds true to his sardonic sense of theme and moralization. The two films also comment on each other. I never knew the phrase ""I am in a world of shit,"" could carry so much impact and meaning. I also liked how Kubrick refrained from glamorizing any aspects of the film. In several juicy sequences, there were distinctive possibilities of sex. While there is sex in the film, Kubrick avoids portraying sex on screen. I think he did this to evade a potential attraction and distraction to the audience.Stanley Kubrick was one of the most vivid, courageous directors that will ever live. He was a perfectionist, always creating a true portrait of his visions. He took risks. Some of them worked, some of them did not. ""Full Metal Jacket"" displays a stunning quality of filmmaking; it was nominated for an Oscar for its achievement in screen writing. But the movie fails to actually entertain and enlighten. I was disappointed in the film. Many audiences will remember Kubrick's portrait of Vietnam as a film that defined a generation, but it's too bad that the film didn't do it entertainingly."
bluehourera,"Sep 12, 2024",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket is one of the most powerful and brutal war films ever made. Released in 1987, the movie is based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford and explores the Vietnam War from the perspective of young Marines. The film is divided into two distinct parts: the intense training of soldiers and the horrifying realities of combat. Kubrick's direction and his approach to both the psychological and physical effects of war make Full Metal Jacket a standout in the war film genre. A very good and intense movie that I've ever seen in my entire life, makes me want to watched it all over again."

chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",8/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket (1987) stands as one of the most striking and thought-provoking war films ever made. With its sharp, satirical tone and unflinching portrayal of the brutality of war, Kubrick crafts an experience that is both terrifying and profoundly introspective. Your 8/10 rating reflects how the film's stark depiction of military life, camaraderie, and the emotional and psychological toll of war leaves a lasting impact on viewers.Full Metal Jacket is divided into two distinct halves, each exploring different aspects of the Vietnam War experience. The first part of the film focuses on the grueling boot camp training of a group of Marines, led by the iconic and terrifying Gunnery Sergeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). The second part follows Private Joker (Matthew Modine), who, after surviving boot camp, is deployed to Vietnam and experiences the horrors of the war firsthand. The shift between the absurdity of the boot camp and the horror of the battlefield highlights the psychological transformation that soldiers undergo, from mindless obedience to the brutal realities of combat.R. Lee Ermey's performance as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman is one of the film's standout achievements. His role as a sadistic, verbally abusive drill instructor is both terrifying and oddly compelling. Ermey, who was a real-life Marine drill instructor, brings an authenticity to the role that is unsettling and unforgettable. His ability to belittle and break down his recruits, while maintaining a sense of dark humor, creates an atmosphere of tension that permeates the film's first half. The power dynamic he creates with the recruits, particularly with the tragic character of Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio), serves as a reflection of the dehumanizing process that soldiers undergo in their training.Vincent D'Onofrio's portrayal of Pyle is equally remarkable. His character's tragic descent into madness is both heartbreaking and horrifying, capturing the psychological toll of the military's brutal indoctrination process. D'Onofrio's performance builds slowly, allowing Pyle's mental and emotional unraveling to resonate deeply with the audience. His transformation from an awkward, overweight recruit into a broken man, consumed by the pressure of military life, is one of the most memorable aspects of the film.Matthew Modine, as the protagonist Private Joker, provides a unique perspective on the war. Joker's role as both a soldier and a journalist allows him to be both an observer and participant in the events unfolding around him. Modine's performance is understated but highly effective, capturing Joker's inner conflict and growing disillusionment with the war. His character is marked by a certain detachment from the horrors of combat, as he attempts to reconcile the absurdities of war with his own sense of morality. This detachment eventually gives way to a more profound understanding of the violence and chaos that surrounds him, particularly as he witnesses the dehumanizing effects of war on both the soldiers and the Vietnamese civilians they encounter.Kubrick's direction is meticulous and precise, capturing the psychological unraveling of soldiers within the context of an absurd and senseless war. The sharp contrast between the drill sergeant's absurdity in boot camp and the chaos of the battlefield underscores the absurdity of the entire war experience. Kubrick uses a combination of dark humor and visceral horror to present the conflicting emotional landscape of soldiers who, on one hand, are trained to kill and follow orders without question, and on the other, are faced with the human cost of that training in combat.The cinematography, by Douglas Milsome, is striking and deliberately composed. Kubrick's signature use of symmetrical framing and deliberate, almost clinical shots adds to the tension and emotional unease of the film. In particular, the second half of the film, set in Vietnam, is marked by some of the most hauntingly beautiful yet unsettling visuals. Kubrick's camera work, along with Milsome's lighting choices, creates a haunting atmosphere that makes the audience feel as though they are in the middle of the horrors unfolding on screen.The film's use of music is also highly effective in creating an eerie, almost surreal tone. The soundtrack features a combination of period-specific pop music, like ""Paint It Black"" by The Rolling Stones, and traditional military chants, both of which serve to juxtapose the normality of life with the chaos of war. The music, like the visuals, creates a sense of dissonance and tension, enhancing the film's critique of the absurdity and violence inherent in war.Thematically, Full Metal Jacket explores the brutal dehumanization of soldiers, the psychological effects of war, and the absurdity of military culture. The film highlights how the military, through its rigid structure and brutal training, strips away individuality and reshapes men into tools of violence. The absurdity of war itself is emphasized throughout, as the soldiers are often caught in a senseless cycle of violence and obedience, with little understanding of the larger political or social forces at play. The disillusionment of the soldiers is starkly illustrated through Joker's journey, as he comes to terms with the moral contradictions of war and his role in it.One of the film's most striking moments occurs near the end, as Joker finds himself face-to-face with the enemy in the streets of Vietnam. His own transformation from an apathetic observer to a soldier fully immersed in the violence and chaos of the war underscores the central theme of the film: that war is not just a physical battle, but a psychological one that leaves lasting scars on those who fight in it.In conclusion, Full Metal Jacket is a gripping and intellectually challenging film that captures the psychological and emotional impact of war with unflinching honesty. Kubrick's direction, combined with outstanding performances from R. Lee Ermey, Vincent D'Onofrio, and Matthew Modine, creates a film that remains as powerful and relevant today as it was when it was first released. With its biting critique of military culture, its examination of the human cost of war, and its timeless visuals and music, Full Metal Jacket is a film that leaves a lasting impression on its viewers."
danielhinton-41951,"Dec 14, 2021",9/10,"Kubrick explores how the US army(or any army) takes ordinary run of the mill civilians and makes them into killing machines. This is done by removing all ideas of the previous identity. The hair is shaved, clothes are replaced by plain green army attire, the name is even removed for example 'private pile' or 'private joker'. After this dependency is required, this is done by controlling hunger and other bio survival instincts, no Jelly doughnuts! The biggest dependency factor in FMJ however is the desire to be good enough in the eyes of the Sargent.R. Lee Ermeys performance is incredible and hilarious. Having already been in the military for a number of years the research had been done and it shows with a performance not only true to character but is as entertaining as samuel L. Jackson in pulp fiction. The film does seem to miss the Sargent after we renter the 2nd half of the film but solid performances from the whole cast and Kubricks humour keep it entertaining while we deal with the more morally heavy material."
aylaykchikin,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is a powerful and intense war film that brilliantly captures the brutality of military life and the Vietnam War. Directed by Stanley Kubrick, it combines dark humor with harsh realism, making for a unique viewing experience. The performances, especially by R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio, are unforgettable and raw, bringing the characters to life in a way that's both gripping and unsettling. The film's dialogue is sharp and iconic, and the direction masterfully portrays the psychological impact of war. It's a must-watch that explores the dehumanizing effects of combat with an unflinching gaze."
searchanddestroy-1,"Aug 12, 2023",N/A,"For me among the most terrific war movies ever made and of course also the best concerning Vietnam War; but it could have concerned any war actually. The first part, boot camp at Camp Pendleton, I guess, is the most impressive, the most terrific, the most unforgettable sequence ever filmed on boot camps; forget TAKE THE HIGH GROUND once and for all as the reference movie on boot camps. Vincent Donofrio gives here his best performance ever, for such a rather blank, wooden actor. It is s a shocking film, but it was the purpose, decided by the master, the unique Stanley Kubrick, the genius, whose heirs are now Christopher Nolan or Denis Villeneuve. Of course there is always Steven and Ridley, but they were already in action when Kubrick was himself still in the business. So, yes, this awsome, brutal, disturbing war movie is a milestone that no moviegoer can miss. No one."
Steffi_P,"Jun 23, 2007",6/10,"The major Vietnam anti-war films all took different approaches to the subject. Apocalypse Now cranked the war experience up into a surrealist nightmare. The Deer Hunter avoided dwelling on the conflict itself and instead focused on the psychological aftermath. Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket, made at a later time when the Vietnam was coming to be regarded as the previous generation's war, focuses on the transformation of men into soldiers.Like most of Kubrick's films, Full Metal Jacket is divided starkly into informal parts 1 and 2. Opening with shots of the recruits having their head shaved (their individuality literally being stripped away), part 1 looks at the training process. Kubrick emphasises the gruelling nature of this process with drab, Spartan sets, straight, symmetrical shot composition and scenes which are relentless and repetitive. It's the stronger half of the film  part 2 just isn't as tight, and despite it's being more varied some segments are just boring.Compared to other Vietnam pictures, Full Metal Jacket has a rather small-scale, cheap look to it. This was the price Kubrick paid for his artistic independence. Having said that, it's impressive that the whole thing was shot in England (aided by one use of footage) and it demonstrates how much an imaginative director and design department can do with limited means. Take, for example, an abandoned industrial estate (of which England has had plenty of since the 1980s), remove anything that gives the location away, graft in a few palm trees, slap on some genuine signs and murals  and you have an authentic looking Vietnam battleground.Full Metal Jacket isn't bad, but there are lots of things I don't like about it. Most of them are down to the screenplay. The dialogue isn't as smart as it thinks it is, full of philosophical pretensions and trite moralism. Kubrick makes some poor decisions as a director too. The over-the-top stylisation of Pyle's mental breakdown  brilliantly staged as it is  doesn't sit well with the realist, occasionally documentary approach used in the majority of the film. Later, in the combat scenes, he uses some really clichéd slow motion shots when people get shot. Peckinpah popularised that, and he's also one of the few directors who could get away with it. Here it just looks amateurish.This is yet another Kubrick film which all too often gets overrated because it is startling and different. It has its strengths (there is some great use of music, although even that is disappointing compared to Kubrick's sublime rhythmic direction on Clockwork Orange and Barry Lyndon) but overall it's one of my least favourite of his."
neeraj31071991,"Dec 24, 2013",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket begins with perhaps the most enjoyable forty-five minutes in the history of all film. FMJ is one of my all time favorite movies by one of my favorite directors. This movies is just another staple in Kubrick's more than impressive film career. Unlike Band of Brothers or Saving Private Ryan, FMJ takes a look into a soldiers Psyche. It shows us how these guys actually went through hell to become Marines and how they are put under so much stress and pressure. Its more about their journey into the war than the war itself and that's what makes this movie stand out. Just an incredible film that is sure a classic. The totality of war, from the loss of self to ultimately the loss of life, has never been as thoroughly examined as in Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Its not only about of what does a soldier lives on the battle field is also all the process it take to become a man a killing machine, an excellent psychological movie that show you other side of the war stories."
Prismark10,"Jul 31, 2013",6/10,"Stanley Kubrick, the eccentric director is lionised by Hollywood. A man who spent the latter part of his life living in London and shooting his films in England despite them being set elsewhere whether it was outer space, some hotel in the mountains of America or in this case a Vietnam war film.Full Metal Jacket arrived with plaudits from the critics. It is a film of two halves, the more interesting part being the first half set at boot camp with a sadistic drill instructor.The second half which is more action orientated, set in Vietnam is less interesting. Why? Because a year earlier we all watched 'Platoon' which swept the big prizes at the Oscars and directed by someone who served in Vietnam.Platoon fully conveyed the anti war message and politics of it all now that some years have passed by since the war ended.The Vietnam films were done better in Platoon and Apocalypse Now. Also these films were at least filmed in a far east location whether it would be the Philippines or Thailand.Full Metal Jacket was filmed in various parts of London dressed up as Vietnam. It shows, the sets do not look authentic, you do not get the feeling you are in the far east and it shows up the limitations of the second half of the story."
rgmosse,"Sep 6, 2014",4/10,"When I first saw this film at the time it came out, I thought it was very good. But now that liberal H-wood has steeped me in its BS for all the years I had subscribed, I now see that the BS theme associated with ""Gomer Pyle"" is that growing into an instrument of war is insanity causing to some. That the ""hero"", ""Joker"", drops his gun when shot at, then mercy kills the sniper that someone else protected him from. And that war is a waste for liberal reasons, not realistic ones. I very much doubt that any actual war movie has ever been made, and certainly not this as one. Saving Private R may be as close as it comes for action and the sense of ""being there"", but the schmaltzy political backdrop takes something from it. Maybe one of these days ."
TheUnknown837-1,"Oct 18, 2010",10/10,"In terms of an ostensible plot outline, ""Full Metal Jacket"" appears to be much like any other period piece set in any war. As a matter of fact, the way that director Stanley Kubrick has constructed his story, it almost seems familiar and routine. It starts us with a collection of mug shots as new Marine recruits are shaved and prepared for basic training, takes us through their grueling preparations for war, and leads us into one of the most harrowing denouements of all time, in which many of those faces we saw at the beginning can no longer be found. But it is not the originality of this story that makes ""Full Metal Jacket"" so great (because it is not original in its plot), it is the sheer harrowing and gut-wrenching plethora of style and nihilism that Kubrick instills into its content.Right from the beginning, Kubrick alerts us that we are not in for a pleasant experience. Even though he creates images that rival the majesty of his 1968 masterpiece ""2001: A Space Odyssey,"" this movie does not leave you wrapped in spectacle, but in sheer horror. Watching our cast having their heads shaved with mask-like expressions devoid of happiness hints to us that it'll get worse for them. And it does. The basic training scenes, which consume half the picture with R. Lee Ermey and Vincent D'Onofrio dominating every frame, are grueling and heart-pounding as we watch these young and naive men be transformed into cold-blooded, deranged killers, some of whom are struggling to maintain their humanity, and others who will lose it entirely.For the back half of the movie, Kubrick almost seems to give us relief at first, by avoiding combat. Then he not only gives us it, but throws it upon us with one of the most shocking third-acts in cinema history. The climax becomes a mixture of three different war movie traditions. Number one, the gungho joy of killing best personified in black-and-white war serials. Number two, the fear of being killed in combat. And three, the traumatizing aftereffects of experiencing the first two. Anybody who does not find the ending of ""Full Metal Jacket"" haunting should sit down and think about their own morality. Kubrick has haunted us before with the terrors of HAL 9000 in ""2001"" and the Singin' in the Rain sequences in ""A Clockwork Orange."" Here, he piles terror on us with shovels.The movie is crammed with fantastic performances. R. Lee Ermey, once a Marine himself and in fact initially hired only as a consultant, is hands-down visceral and brilliant as the drill sergeant determined to turn his recruits into mechanical killers like their own rifles. Matthew Modine is commendably convincing as the baby-faced Marine who would rather write about Vietnam than experience it. The other two most notable performances are by Adam Baldwin and Vincent D'Onofrio, who are first-class examples of what war and combat do to people.""Full Metal Jacket"" is just as great as any film made about any other war. In the category of the Vietnam War genre, it ranks up with ""Apocalypse Now,"" ""Platoon,"" and ""The Deer Hunter"" and is probably the second-best of the four. Kubrick may have been telling an ostensibly familiar story, but the way he constructs it and manipulates our responses makes it idiosyncratic and towering above its familiars. It is one of the two best films he ever directed."
Shilo_R_A,"Mar 29, 2021",8/10,"Full Metal Jacket follows a new recruit to the marines (who gets the nickname Private Joker) during his hard, dehumanizing training, and later on throughout the Vietnam War. He struggles to keep his individuality and values, serving but not willing to kill. On his helmet is the writing ""Born to kill"", and on his vest there's a peace symbol. When asked, at first he's not sure what it means. Maybe something about the duality of man, he finally replies. But the one who asked probably doesn't really get it.Anyway, to the review itself. A lot of people point out that movie has two distinct parts, and I tend to agree with that.The first part is in the bootcamp, and it's honestly quite perfect. The dialogue. The acting. The pacing. The characters, especially. Everything works together so well, and I got shivers going down my spine so many times during this part of the film. I can't think of a single thing the threw me off about this part.The second part, the war itself, has such a different tone. Strangely enough, the tone is a bit lighter on the second part, compared to the first. I think that it's probably because the soldiers are more loose out there. Even though some of them just hide the trauma and keep shooting, and some others laugh with disturbing joy while shooting helpless civillians, the bootcamp felt so strict, so cult-like, so traumatizing.I love this part as well - I think that maybe here and there it has some weaker moments, but the climax and ending are both great, and the camerawork here is literally phenomenal. The score and soundtrack are good as well (The first part had much less music, but it fitted the tone).And if action is what you seek in war films, well...I guess you'd prefer this part over the previous one, but I truly believe that the first part is at least near perfect.Overall, Full metal Jacket is definitely worth watching. It is an emotional story about human beings as the system breaks them, rebuilds them, and sends them all to fight a war that will break them once more. It's about protecting your identity. And it's about the scars that the army might leave on one that goes through it. I'm feeling an 8.6/10."
tylerkom,"Sep 7, 2020",8/10,"Kubrik flexes his directing muscles in a film unlike any other he had done previously. A true to genre war film, this retains only few of the signature traces of the strangeness that he is known for. Don't be fooled by the unassuming nature of the film though; this is perhaps the zenith of what a traditional war film can be.The plot is straightforward as can be, as we follow Joker through boot camp and into the blasted out lines of Vietnam. What this film does absolutely exceptionally is portray war and military life in a very real way. And I don't mean real in the way Saving Private Ryan is real; real in the sense of what the day to day attitudes of these men were. They tell jokes, they mess with each other, they are appalled by the job, they love the job, they love their brothers, they pay for prostitutes, they are saddened by the savagery. Of course, there are the exaggerated events at boot camp, but these only serve to show the way the military shapes these young boys into tools of war.The film is also funny. Despite being an obvious statement film, it really doesn't take itself too seriously. If there are any downsides to the film, it's perhaps that it doesn't try anything new. Kubrik executed the film to its highest potential and perhaps that's all we can ask of it.A very tight and entertaining film. Maybe missing that X factor that would propel it to being an all timer, but it's certainly a great film"
jldmp1,"Aug 4, 2006",9/10,"Even if this had no opening credits, this would be immediately recognizable as Kubrick's work.All of his essential war film components are here, as self reference: the camera movement of ""Paths of Glory"", the 'fighting a square' and running the gauntlet from ""Barry Lyndon"". There is 'Rafterman' as the photographer (the camera operator) and 'Joker' as the writer. Modine is given the task of writing the story within the story as the character, and outside the story, narrating with retroactive knowledge.We love the beginning third for the spot-on performances of Ermey and D'Onofrio. But as with all of Kubrick's work, the plot and dialogue are really just secondary concerns. What makes this grip, unlike the works of many lesser filmmakers, is the supremacy of the camera. On the Island, the camera is on a dolly...disciplined, humiliated. In country, it is held-held, it marches, charges, crouches and hides. We get a lesson from the master in how to build story inertia through visual narrative inertia.And in the finale, the most striking feature here, the idea of the camera as rifle/rifle as camera duality. The camera literally becomes the sniper's weapon. And who ultimately puts a metaphorical end to the deadly vision? The photographer...then the writer dispatches it and the story with a prayer. Heavy duty stuff."
Movie-Dood198027,"Oct 14, 2024",9/10,"To prepare for the month of training in the national service of my country I decided to watch Stanley Kubrick's Full Metal Jacket.Stanley Kubrick is My Favorite Director of all time and since I've completed his filmography last year I've begun appreciating his films even more seeing a lot of stuff and videos about the production of some of his films including some unfinished projects and what I've known about Stanley Kubrick is you never experience a Kubrick film if you Only watch it once.Stanley Kubrick's take on the Vietnam war is an ambitious and ambiguous film , it draws a lot of inspiration from real life marine corp training and boot camps and I think that Stanley Kubrick has really proven himself that he can Take any genre and turn it into the perfect version of itself and indeed Full metal jacket is one of the best IF NOT the best war film ever made.The acting in this film is absolutely Generational, The absolutely HARSH and ruthless but fair Drill Sargent Played by the Very talented Actor R. Lee Ermey , His performance is absolutely OUTSTANDING and absolutely Unforgettable his lines makes you laugh in despair at what the marines have to face , The fact that R. Lee Ermey was an actual Drill sergeant before only makes his Iconic performance even more memorable , his scenes were the best in the film , he fills the screens with chaos and slurs , He pushes the marines into their fullest to try to make the ""Perfect Soldier"" in a way , I loved his performance and he definitely deserves the praise he gets Not only is his acting genuine but Absurdly funny , the Slurs and the Words that he say to the marines are literally a weapon , it reflects on how He wants to see them as solldiers and he defined his excellence by indicating that He is hard and they will not like him but he is Fair.Matthew Modine was also pretty great As Pvt. Joker . His appreciation to the marines corp was great and what I really like about Pvt. Joker is how he stays relevant and serious when it matters which adds more to his character depth and overall. Such a great leading character in the film.Vincent D'Onofrio as Pvt. Pyle was an Incredible character . He is what the audience kind of relate with the most , the way he dosent ""perfect"" his training or the other duties that Hartman tells him to do makes his character a little symphethic and it reflects on on the cruel nature and the harsh environments which is really a great take on a Private to make him really be the ""other side of the coin"".What this film perfected is the Effects of war on a Man and what it turns him into , The drill Sargent's goal was to turn those Men into killing machines but what people don't really talk about a lot is how Gny. Sgt. Hartman actually did it and he didn't just do it he perfect it and I'm talking about Pvt. Pyle , not only did he break him from the inside , he crushed him and filled him with slurs to try to perfect him but what Pvt. Pyle actually was , was a Successful Transformation that Hartman has done but didn't fully realize it , the way He gets punished and all of that reflects on the behavior and cruelty of such activities no matter the circumstances. Kubrick definitely perfected that aspect.What a lot of people dislike is how the film progresses , everyone Loved the first chapter of the film (Boot camp) and disliked how empty that transition felt but Kubrick's a genius and no frame goes by him without confirmation and Kubrick delivering that hard cut from the toilet incident straight to Vietnam was a solid decision , it shows the Progress then the result , progress was in the Boot camp and the result were in the Vietnam Sequences.The action and set design was incredible as always , the war zone scenes and the soundtrack was incredible espically the last 20 minutes , I really liked how the sudden tone shift happend and how the whole vibe went to a different tone. The slow paced ending was an incredible decision by Kubrick and was enhanced by Matthew Modine's performance and I think Full metal Jacket's ending was incredible.Overall Stanley Kubrick is the Greatest Director of all time and Full metal jacket is my #3rd Best Kubrick film (#1 the shining, #2 A clockwork orange ) Kubrick's take on the mental effects of the war in this film were incredible . The acting by R. Lee Ermey was unforgettable and Iconic , Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as private pyle was absolutely well done that Kubrick state is unforgettable , Matthew Modine's performance was also incredible as well, the Soundtrack was also pretty spectacular and the music choice was amazing.Overall an incredible War film with iconic performances and memorable lines , Full metal jacket is the best war film ever made and Stanley Kubrick is the greatest director of all time."
cb808,"Oct 17, 1998",N/A,"This movie may be remembered more for the hilarious insults of the drill instructor than any message about war it offers. Its attempts at sarcasm and humor up until the climax are appreciated, and that is what separates this from most other war movies. But the power of the climatic scene is lost because of this and any clear message about Vietnam remains vague. This may or may not be a good thing. Not to say that FMJ doesn't have its share of powerful drama. The outcome of the rivalry between Private Pyle and Drill Instructor Hartmann is a scene I will never forget.  I can certainly say this movie is entertaining and worth more than a few viewings."
paul-allaer,"Nov 13, 2020",7/10,"Let me state upfront that I have seen ""Full Metal Jacket"" more than once over the years, but I can't recall when the last time was. I'm guessing it's been at least 15 years ago, if not more. Frankly, I remembered very little of the movie's specifics (mainly the ""drill instructor"" scenes). On top of that, I am a huge Staley Kubrick fan and admirer. When I noticed a few days ago that this film was on Showtime's schedule, I did not hesitate and eagerly looked forward to seeing it again, which I did just yesterday..""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987 release; 116 min.) is in fact two movies into one. The first one could be called ""Drill"" and covers the opening 45 min., and the second one could be called ""Deployed"" and covers the remaining 70 min. of the movie. But for 2 reoccurring characters, these 2 films stand on their own. ""Drill"" is nothing short of brilliant, with Lee Ermey's overpowering performance as the senior drill instructor front and center (Ermey was of course a real life Marines drill instructor and supposedly adlibbed major parts of his performance). But ""Drill"" really has nothing to do with the Vietnam war as such. ""Deployed"" is set in Vietnam, but here also I found little connection with the Vietnam War, as the series of platoon incidents that are presented here could've happen just as well in WWII or the Korean War. The fact that the entire movie was shot in England doesn't help. Yes, the performances are top-notch, and yes, the (Oscar-nominated) script is tight, but this film is really on the same theme as ""Dr. Strangelove"" as anything, namely the absurdity of war, rather than taking a close look what happened specifically in Vietnam. Compare this to, for example, The Deer Hunter, or Platoon, or Apocalypse Now (perhaps the most Vietnam-centric of them all).Is Full Metal Jacket a bad movie? Of course not. But neither is it, in my (very subjective personal) opinion, among the very best of Kubrick's films. I totally understand and respect that others may have a different opinion on this. In any event, I enjoyed watching this for what it is."
MovieKPFan1995,"Dec 16, 2019",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is my favorite Stanley Kubrick movie of all time, and it's my 2nd favorite war movie of all time.This movie is about Private ""Joker"" Davis (played by Matthew Modine) who is going through basic training and is suffering through insults from his foul mouthed drill sarge, Hartman (R. Lee Ermey) and helps a guy named Private ""Pyle"" Lawrence (Vincent D'Onofrio) get through basic training. Pyle takes a pretty bad detour, and Joker is graduating to the Marine Corps and is sent to Vietnam, where he joins the Battle of Hué.Full Metal Jacket was a masterpiece and a great war film. It had an awesome story, the acting was fantastic, the war elements were amazing, and it ran in a fast pace.R. Lee Ermey, did a great job in this movie. Not only does he get to be humorous, but he does a great job at playing a legit drill sergeant. Vincent D'Onofrio was pretty good at playing Private Pyle, as he turned psycho later on, and Modine was great as the lead character.The war elements were also phenomenal. With all the gun action, explosions, and violence, they really did a solid job giving this film some good war spirit.Over all, I love Full Metal Jacket and is definitely the 2nd best war movie I have ever seen right next to ""Saving Private Ryan.I give this movie a perfect 10 out of 10 and I highly recommend this movie if you haven't seen it."
pawebster,"Jul 25, 2006",7/10,"I enjoyed this the most of the Vietnam films I've seen. It's a weird film in many ways. Many have commented on the fact that it is actually two films rather flimsily stuck together. The first half, on the training, is rightly famous as the most extreme of its genre, but let's face it, it was not exactly a new idea, even in the mid 80s. An Officer and a Gentleman had visited the area not many years before. The way that that sequence ends is overdone in my view. It's certainly not subtle.What makes FMJ better than other films, such as Platoon or Hamburger Hill, is that it has some humanity about it. The end sequence with the sniper is touching. In contrast, Platoon goes so far in showing that War Is Hell and Life Is Meaningless that one starts to lose interest. Meaninglessness is actually uninteresting.It shares with other Vietnam films the problem that we don't really get to know the characters enough and cannot sufficiently follow or empathise with their motivation and actions. Matthew Modine's character can be summarised as 'nice guy with a sense of irony' and that's about all. This is not really enough to carry the film.For a British viewer like me, it's hard to forget that this was almost entirely filmed in England, a country not exactly famous for its similarity in geography and climate to the jungles of S.E. Asia. The use of the old Beckton gasworks as Hue City is weird. It's very obvious that no one is sweating and no one is fighting off mosquitoes, etc. They were probably wishing they could wear overcoats at the time!"
malym,"Nov 14, 2006",3/10,"VERY SLIGHT SPOILERS HERESorry, guys, to write that, but I just don't like this film. Not even a bit. It got the 3/10 from me just because I'm aware of the existence of Titanic.Many of you write this film is authentic, blablabla... I'm pretty sure none of you has ever been in a training camp or in a war (neither I have). So how do you know? Well, I know it wasn't authentic. Consider the scene with the trainee in the camp having hard time climbing over the hurdle. Well, a funny scene, wasn't it? Just like an one from Police Academy. (BTW, I prefer Police Academy to Full Meta Jacket, when I want to see a comedy.) All the jokes (or at least half of them) make this film sentimental and the ""serious"" war scenes pathetic. Oh, yes, the war scenes... I really liked the authenticity of burning concrete. Have you ever seen burning concrete with flames in equal distances from each other? If not, watch the film, this is your opportunity! But the scene which really got me was when the marines went to save their dying/dead friend, undergoing a certain death and violating the orders. Well, if this is how American soldiers behave, then there's no wonder they didn't win the Vietnam war.Some of you say the strength of this film is in describing the violence. Well, I felt completely untouched. I'm not an American spectator, crying when the marines lose their brother in the war. If you want to see violence that makes you want to vomit and have bad dreams, you should see ""Salo"" from Pasolini - film without a single drop of blood (as far as I remember).Alright, all in all I think this movie is far away from authenticity, it has been shot for the American (male) audience and I don't like it. The last remark - people write that Full Metal Jacket is an epic film. No, it isn't. Why should it be? If you want to see a great epic film from Kubrick, watch 2001: The Space Odyssey. This is a masterpiece. FMJ is crap."
adrianmordreddpics,"Sep 11, 2024",10/10,"Director Stanley Kubrick rips the skin from the face of war to expose the dehumanizing effect of the military on the people fed to its emotional meat grinder in Full Metal Jacket. Through the eyes of an 18-year-old recruit--from his first days in the seeming hell of Marine Corps boot camp as his superiors try to strip of him his individuality and re-create him as a Marine, to the hell of the 1968 Tet offensive, Kubrick reveals the damage done to the collective human soul by the inhumanity of war. Based on the novel The Short-Timers by Gustav Hasford. This is amust watch for all the movie enthusiast out there."
nh3nh4,"Dec 1, 2005",8/10,"People seem to have totally missed the point of this movie. This is a war movie, but its more so about soldiers - American soldiers to be precise.It shows the shallow gang-ho attitude which is ingrained into marines at booth camp, creating a sort of ultra ego for them and where they can hide from their insecurities. Those who are 'honest', Pyle cannot live with that and flips.Then how these 'super soldiers' actually perform in real war. Well, they talk ' the talk' but as it shows, 'they really can't walk the walk'. The battle scenes, soldiers talking to the camera, and the final scene is all an indication of that.In this movie Kubrick is at his best, poking fun at US army and its culture. and also American machismo male stereotype and their utter ignorance of the rest of the world.With Iraq a hot issue today, this movie resonates more then ever."

beeeuty,"Feb 10, 1999",10/10,"The best war film ever! Brought me back to my days in boot camp and combat, and made me want more! I truly feel this movie is a must for anyone who ever thinks war is full of drama, glamour and / or romance, as it will change you forever! War is hell, and for those who make it thru it, it never stops."
TheFurious,"Dec 29, 2003",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket is one of the most brilliant and intelligent anti-war movies ever - as already states by many other users before. Trust them.Many people consider the first half of the film to be very interesting, but they don´t seem to appreciate the second half. This must be due to the fact that both parts are very different from each other. The first part is more comical, the story and its message are quite plain. The drill seargant is a character everybody likes to quote, and the pace of the 1st half is quite high.Nevertheless one shouldn´t underestimate the second half of the movie. Do not be disappointed about the slower pace or the missing ""radical"" characters. Listen closely to the dialogues instad. Each of those little scences and episodes told conveys the madness of war better than most fighting scences could ever do."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Dec 19, 2020",6/10,"It's easy to forget that the boot camp stuff only makes up half of 'Full Metal Jacket (1987)', as it's this segment that has cemented itself in pop culture. There's almost an entire movie set after this, one which sees our heroes shipped off to Vietnam to take part in the grim process of war. It's nearly impossible to critique the film as a cohesive whole because it actually feels like two separate pictures stuck together. Both of these pieces have full narrative arcs, which leads to an odd overall pacing. More specifically, it creates a tremendous slowdown in the affair's mid-section. You have to reorient yourself and get acquainted with this almost complete shift in location, tone and, even, plot. Furthermore, it's only when we get to Vietnam that a proper protagonist starts to emerge. However, it's not like the second half is unsuccessful, although it certainly isn't as successful as the first. It's a bleak and somewhat harrowing exploration of war which presents its morality in shades of grey and expects its audience to make up their own minds about its conflict. There are some stand-out set-pieces and a few surprising moments, too. It just doesn't quite come together as well as it perhaps should have and feels a little at odds with the US-based stuff it follows. The first half is almost entirely situational, unconcerned with its individual characters, and focuses on the brainwashing performed by the American military. It's highly effective and probably gets under your skin more than some of the (arguable) war crimes seen later on. The performance of R. Lee Ermey is as integral to this as its reputation would suggest. It's loud, cruel and abrasive; the filmmaking often puts you in the position of the recruits, making you feel like you're the one being yelled at. Vincent D'Onofrio also gives a stand-out turn as a bullied individual. I won't spoil his arc, all I'll say is that the way he acts in his final scene is straight-up scary. Overall, the movie is a well-made examination of military propaganda and the meat-machine of war. It's sometimes a little too slow for its own good (especially after it shifts locations) and it's also generally rather uneven. However, it's a relatively effective and engaging experience. 6/10"
slowcando,"Sep 3, 2025",8/10,"Most viewers find the first half superior to the second half: I find them equally rewarding. The first half is the most famous, memorable and lauded...and rightly so. The dialogue and character moments are very strong. However its intimate barracks setting pales in comparison to the second-half's high-end production where Kubrick's camera gets to roam free, eating up the convincingly-authentic destructive scenery. Often I found myself imagining how nice these places looked before the war, such was the richness of the attention-to-detail.Long single-take scenes like Joker & the photographer disembarking a helicopter, the camera crew filming while The Bird song plays, the path to the sniper....all extremely immersive! Also props to the soundtrack: cool choice of well-known songs from the era, plus an effectively-moody synth-led score (by Kubrick's daughter, incidentally).My favourite scene is right near the end: the Vietcong lady...praying in barely-audible whisper. Powerful.Full Metal Jacket almost feels like it deserves the 9/10, putting it alongside 1917 & A Bridge Too Far in my war-film rankings (Apocalype Now undisputed king with a mega-rare 10/10). However, Kubrick's effort often - always - feels very clinical. It lacks the artful trippy hedonism of Coppola's epic, the emotive hero's journey of 1917 or the more coherent tactical plotting of A Bridge Too Far. It all just kinda happens, and I felt little connection to any of the characters....tho' did enjoy Joker's musing about the Duality-of-Man to a befuddled superior. However outside of Joker, and earlier the Drill Instructor, the dialogue is generally merely functional.Still, a very strong 8/10...and having now seen all the Kubrick flicks, I'd rank FMJ 5th in the Stanley Table:1) 2001: 10/10.2) Eyes Wide Shut: 9/10.3) Lolita: 9/10.4) Clockwork Orange: 8/10.5) Full Metal Jacket: 8/10.6) Spartacus: 8/10.7) The Shining: 8/10.8) Barry Lyndon: 7/10.9) The Killing: 7/10.10) Dr Strangelove: 6/10.11) Killer's Kiss: 6/10.12) Paths of Glory: 5/10."

It really did look like a stage play and unrealistic cinematically. Cheesy actually."
raheemullah-37575,"Aug 14, 2019",1/10,I don't knkw how this movie got such good reviews. The story was attrociuos
luke-a-mcgowan,"Mar 30, 2015",9/10,"Full Metal Jacket is undoubtedly the finest war film I have ever seen. Startlingly authentic and deeply intimate, the film is carried by a sharp screenplay, spectacular direction and some bravos performances. Though the film does have central characters, the main character here is the war itself and the story of recruit to hero. Some may argue that Matthew Modine's Private Joker should have been a more developed character, but I would argue he was given just the right amount of depth.The first 45 minutes - the story of Staff Sergeant Hartman and Private Pyle - is a flawless masterpiece. A combination of Hartman's spectacular one-liners, delivered with such flawless execution, and Vincent D'Onofrio's Oscar-worthy and woefully under shadowed performance, for the entire first act of the film I was captivated. The drills are real, the characters are real, and the mental anguish of Gomer Pyle is very real. The film dips very slightly when we go to Vietnam, as it misses any characters with the memorability of Pyle and Hartman. However, the film's superb screenplay and frighteningly staged battle scenes - superior in feel if not quality to every other war film I've seen - more than keep you engrossed.Kubrick's direction is masterful. There are moments throughout - tracking shots, behavioural quirks of minor characters, the dialogue of a dying Vietnamese, the hiring of R Lee Ermey - that scream ""master of his field"". In one scene, a lieutenant is asked about casualties as he stands next to a war grave. Clearly unaware of what to do, he constantly stops and smiles for the camera, a horrific juxtaposition given the horror just behind him. It is moments like this where Kubrick is to be considered in the conversation for Best Director of all time."
Kevinator007,"May 9, 2009",8/10,"This is not an epic movie. There are no heroes, no legendary feats in this movie, it's no band of brothers, it's a Kubrick film. And it's a fantastic one. Kubrick never did in complex scenarios, the plot in this movie, is simple, a group young Americans being trained to join the marines forms the first part, which to me is the main one. You can see Kubrick's work at its best in that first part. Seargeant Instructor Hartman, what a character! He is in your face from the first minute of the film, and those scenes at the camp were wonderfully shot. Close ups to bank on actors' performances and add intensity to the scenes, and intense they were. The humiliating and degrading treatment imposed by the Sergeant Instructor to the whole group, especially to Pvt Pyle, is frightening. The star performer in that first part to me has got to be Pvt Pyle. The scenes are shot in a succession of defining events, so that your eyes are scotched to the screen.The second part takes place in Vietnam, a Vietnam ravaged by war. Now I have to admit here that there have been better war movies shot in the heat of battle if you are looking for spectacular, rapid, grandiose fighting. Apocalypse Now would be a superb example. But here Kubrick, offers a more intimate view of fighting and always keeps it simple but pleasing on the eye. Many will say that the first part is of higher quality than the second, it could be true. But I think that the second part had to be shot in this way, nothing too over the top, a plot so simple and intense, so that it is difficult to forget. Do you remember most of the scenes in saving private ryan? No matter how much you prepare for war, how well trained you are, you can never be ready for the real thing. At the camp, the guys were subjected to the worst kind of treatment and yet in Vietnam, the war is a different proposition. Each war is different, the Vietnam war was not the same as the second world war when you knew what you were fighting for. It is certainly different to what is going on right now. But the films treating the subject of Vietnam war will be rarer and rarer, Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Full Metal Jacket are the best three films on Vietnam war. Therefore, Kubrick's work here should be a collector's item even if as an adrenaline junky, you could see better war films."
TheHonestCritic,"Feb 7, 2022",10/10,"""Full Metal Jacket"" (1987), I remember when I first saw this movie. It was sometime during my 12th grade war and conflicts class. That was one of my favorite classes that I've ever taken in school, the teacher for that class, as well as my 9th grade social studies class was my favorite teacher of all-time, he's great! Any way, we did a unit on the Vietnam War in that class. Right as we were about to wrap up that unit, my teacher called for a vote from us. We had a choice of whether to take a test on the Vietnam War, or watch ""Full Metal Jacket"". Obviously, the vote was unanimous for watching the film. I'm ecstatic we did, I thoroughly enjoyed it all the way from beginning to end! As some of you know, I'm not that big a fan of war movies. But, ""Full Metal Jacket"" has found an exclusive spot on my top ten all-time favorite war films! Before I wrote this review, I watched it again in order to refresh my memory. Every time I see this movie, it just gets better and better. ""Full Metal Jacket"" has a perfect story, perfect acting, perfect sets/locations, perfect special effects, and of course a perfect soundtrack to tie it together. The plot is based on the novel, ""The Short-Timers"" by Gustav Hasford, who wrote the screenplay for this film, alongside of Michael Herr and also writer/director Stanley Kubrick. Now, I haven't read the book before. But, if this movie is any indication, I should check it out! Any way, the story is, a platoon of U. S. Marines go through boot camp training, but two of them have issues with their D. I. After that, the squadron is sent overseas to fight in Vietnam. I won't give any extra details about the storyline. But, let me assure you, when you watch it, you will be invested and intrigued all the way through. It's one of the fastest 116 minutes you'll ever spend watching any film. Props to you, Stanley Kubrick! He is one of my top ten all-time favorite directors, and his work here further solidifies that fact. As for the acting, it is stellar from the whole entire cast. They all do fantastic in this movie! But, the top three standout performances come from: Matthew Modine as Private/Sergeant J. T. ""Joker"" Davis, Vincent D'Onofrio as Private Leonard ""Gomer Pyle"" Lawrence and R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Those three really make this film! But, my favorite performance comes from R. Lee Ermey as Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. Fun fact: R. Lee Ermey is a former Marine drill instructor. His original job was to be an advisor on the film set, to see that the boot camp scenes were accurate. However, Stanley Kubrick saw potential in R. Lee Ermey, and had him play Gunnery Sergeant Hartman. What a brilliant decision that was! It just goes to show, that some of the best performances can come from people with no formal acting training! He ad-libbed all of his lines and dialogue, which resulted in such a memorable and iconic character portrayal. This film shaped him into the celebrity we know today. Every movie he gets involved with is usually made a lot better if he's in it. But, in my opinion, this is R. Lee Ermey's best role and performance. He knocked it out of the park, and fired on all cylinders! All of the sets/locations are perfect and give this film an amazing atmosphere. The surprising thing about this movie, is that it was hardly filmed on-location. It was actually shot at various places in England! That was a bit of a stretch, but, they really made it genuinely look like Marine Corps Recruit Depot Parris Island and Vietnam. Props to the set designers! As for the special effects, they are all very well-done and still hold up to this day. Finally, the soundtrack written by Stanley Kubrick's own daughter, Vivian Kubrick a.k.a. Abigail Mead, is exceptional. Her film score sets the perfect tone for the storyline and helps bring the movie to life. All of the songs are outstanding! But, my personal favorite is, ""Hello Vietnam"" by Johnnie Wright. Whenever I happen to hear that song, it makes me want to watch this film. Plus, it's just a great song in general! The unique thing about the soundtrack in this movie, is that most of it is comprised of music by various bands, rather than being a traditional film score, and it works brilliantly. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is nothing but cinematic gold in the genre of war movies. I could watch it over and over and not get tired of it! Of course, I give this movie 5 out of 5 stars on my scale, which equates to 10 out of 10 IMDB stars. If you haven't seen this film, go watch it, especially if you're a fan of the war genre. I guarantee that you'll love it! If you love war movies, then this film is essentially gift-wrapped for you. To wrap up my review, let us all have a moment of silence for the late, but great; Stanley Kubrick and R. Lee Ermey. May they both rest in peace. Any way, go and check out ""Full Metal Jacket"" today. Otherwise, you better be on the lookout for Gunnery Sergeant Hartman!"
9khjxz,"Nov 14, 2002",10/10,"If this movie was about war, it might be seen as mediocre. That's perhaps why there are so many people deceived with the development of the story.Full Metal Jacket is about the way the human soul reacts to warfare; The way we prepare men for it, the way we look at it, not only the way we suffer it but also the way we 'see' it. The films character 'Joker' is like the playing card with the same name: It changes 'ad hoc'. More than the anti-war person that he happens to be, 'Joker' is the distant observer of a phenomenon he doesn't regard as his own but one that he is progressively part of. This dynamic process, from the absent recruit to the compassionate executer of a girl warrior happens through the eyes of a camera, the scenario being the very 'ink' that paints blood black. That may be the main reason for the sequence of the second part of the film. Kubrik spares the spectator to an excessive exposure to the 'horrors' of war concentrating, rather, on the relationship of a conscious human, 'Joker', with the 'facts of war' as he becomes progressively familiar with them (that's why Joker is a journalist, not a nurse). Far from an unrealistic and static picture of war, the second part of the film is relatively stripped of action of men suffering war in order to expose war as an external phenomenon, through Joker's pictures. That's how Joker sees it in the begining of the second part. We have here a picture not of war itself, but the 'ways in war' of the type of warrior that went through the first part of the film and, eventually, survived and the critical observation made by Joker of their deeds. Note that if 'Joker' was pro-war character the film could be quite the same except for the feeling expressed by Joker himself regarding the killing of the Vietcong girl. Full Metal Jacket starts with a critical analysis of the distortion of human values by army training or, as one might see it, 'restraining' of the human being and ends with a reflection on the necessity and the inevitability of that distortion through the rendition of Joker's character.The here is not 'Form whom the bell tolls', not even a remark (amongst many) that it does. Full Metal Jacket, a type of ammunition itself, is a look into the sound of the bell.All in all, a masterpiece."
jackhammer111,"Jul 21, 2013",7/10,"The movie is well reviewed by others and most people find it very compelling. I like it to but am bothered by some shifts in tone in the final third although I think Kubrick deserves credit for not dodging the issue of atrocities.I prefer war movies that don't glorify war more as in ""Platoon"" or the great German U-Boat film ""Das Boot"" (see it in German with English subtitles, when they overdubbed it in English they wrecked a great background soundtrack). All in all there's a bit too much flag waving in this for me but it's a great movie but I can help remembering that part of the promotion for ""Full Metal Jacket"" including displaying the novel that served as source material for it in supermarket checkout lanes. Seeing Kubrick's name on it I picked it up. The novel was called ""the Short Timers"" written by Marine Gustav Hasford who was in theater during 1968-69. The great prolific essayist, columnist, novelist, screen writer (including my favorite sci fi movie, ""a Boy and his Dog"") Harlan Ellison said of Short timers ""It is one of the most amazing stretches of writing I've ever encountered."" Even though I know this is a movie review, not a book review, I have to tell you the source for most of the movie was written largely in a different kind of English called jarhead lingo. It was very cool to read inspired sections that are prose written with those word.Unfortunately, way more people were interested in watching Kubrick's movie than reading the real deal, the book didn't sell well, his deal with Kubrick wasn't very good and Hasford died alone almost broke in a motel room in Greece of heart related diabetic problems.I don't know which is more heartbreaking. Hasford's early death or the fact that ""the Short Timers"" is out of print while people still buy Kubrick's movie and somebody gets paid.The book has now become a rather expensive collector's item selling online for between $15 and upwards of $400.If you Google the title and his name you'll find a link to a scribd page that will load the whole book like a pdf. But you can't save or download it without paying. But you can read it."
noebes2,"Feb 26, 2015",9/10,"""This is my riffle. There are many like it but this one is mine"". This cue could encompass this excellent movie released in 1987. Eight years after the end of the Vietnam War, Stanley Kubrick decided to depict it in a very original way, by representing the war as a tragic love story between a man and his weapon.The film is divided in two complementary parts. The first one focuses on a training camp, in which we follow a young man nicknamed ""Joker"" discovering the life in a barrack, and being bullied and humiliated by his sergeant. It is a transcription of the human relationships that appear when a hundred men renounce to think by themselves, which leads to terrible consequences. The second part shows Joker covering the Vietnam War as a correspondent for the newspaper ""Stars and Stripes"". We follow him from the rear to the very front, so we can confront the views of different unconventional characters about their situation.The originality in Kubrick's film is that he doesn't present the war as a hell where human are sent to being slaughtered, on the contrary of the majority of war films: blood is here considered as a God. And the dichotomy in the structure permits to distinguish the dogmatic part (the training) and the fanatic one (the fight). This religious presentation of the situation implies that the film is not the story of one person discovering the war: it's a real fresco of the soldiers. We are confronted to the ones who live killing, the ones who are disgusted, the ones who have become mac because they couldn't stand what they were doing Blood is omnipresent, as a powerful and evil character.But the most important and stunning part of Kubrick's work is that he manages to transcribe the atmosphere of this very odd period, split between the horror of the war and the societal progresses of the sixties. The film is a superposition of contrasts, between good and bad, silence and noise, color and gray, calmness and violence For example, Kubrick's alters long shots and very rapid cuts to oppose the cohesion and the hatred between soldiers. The music, that is nearly absent of the movie, appears once in the second part and is in total contradiction with the horror of the images shown. The paroxysm of those contrasts is when the soldiers joke about John Wayne on the battlefield.So in summary, Kubrick's movie mixes human relations, numerous representations of soldiers, a stunning direction Definitely a masterpiece."
gabzz103,"Feb 13, 2006",7/10,"In Stanley Kubrick's second-to-last film, Full Metal Jacket, Private Joker (Matthew Modine) tells an account of what happened to him in Vietnam. The film starts off in a boot camp. Private Joker, along with many other men are forced to follow extremely strict orders by Gunnery Seargeant Hartman (R. Lee Ermey). We see how the men are brainwashed into making them emotionally ready for battle. They are screamed at by the Seargeant that they are worthless, punished for the most minor mistake, etc. We meet one of the men, Private Pyle (Vincent D'Onofrio), who is the less physically active man who just can't get anything right. He is continuously harassed by the Seargeant, being completely humiliated all the time by the Seargeant and the other men.In the boot camp, we mostly see the mentality that the army wanted the soldiers to have. The yelling of ""I am a killer."" shows how these normal men have become something completely different than when they first came in.After the first half in the boot camp, Private Joker is assigned to be a journalist. For me, that was the point where everything turned into an average film. Many soldiers tell their views about the war, they are now desensitized to the killing of Viatmese soldiers, sometimes even civilians. The conclusion of the movie is quite surprising but they should have added more in my opinion.For the technical aspects, the direction was fine. Just fine, not excellent, extraordinary or great, I found it just a bit above average. Don't get me wrong, I have a lot of respect for Kubrick, I have A Clockwork Orange and 2001 : A Space Odyssey in my top 20 but I didn't feel any genius or brilliance in Full Metal Jacket unlike the movies that I just named. The acting was decent but Vincent D'Onofrio played his character quite well, a very memorable and creepy performance.In the first half of the movie, I really enjoyed the character development of all the men in the boot camp. It was very good, it really made the viewer think. After we first go to Vietnam, the movie turned into an average war film. To me, nothing really stood out, the quality of the movie suddenly dropped. It wasn't bad, no, it just didn't feel like a Kubrick picture or a ""great"" film.Overall, I would still recommend this movie. I was disappointed but there is still a lot of good in it. Much more good than bad by far but I just don't see how it became to be considered as one of the best war movies of all-time.My rating : 7.5/10 - almost an 8/10"
Bud_Sturguess,"Jan 21, 2003",10/10,"In what is probably the greatest war movie ever made, we follow an everyman, Private Joker (Matthew Modine), as he struggles through the torture of late-sixties boot camp, the boredom of life as a combat correspondent in Vietnam, and finally as a fighting soldier during the 1968 Tet Offensive. This gritty, uncompromising drama shocked many for its brutality, most notably Vincent D'Onofrio's performance as an ""oat-fed innocent"" private slowly transformed to a psychotic sniper with a death wish. R. Lee Ermey's unrelenting drill instructor is flawless and chillingly real, Modine is great as the cynical Joker, as is Adam Baldwin's portrayal of ""Animal Mother."" Dour and frightening characters all around. ""Full Metal Jacket"" is definitely the defining war movie because of what it does not attempt to be...cliched heroics and glory speeches (like other war epics ""We Were Soldiers"" and ""The Green Beret""). A must-see for war movie fans, and lovers of poignant gritty drama. Oscar-nominated script by director Stanley Kubrick, Michael Herr, and Gustav Hasford (who also wrote the novel ""The Short-Timers"")."
marmar-69780,"Dec 10, 2019",8/10,"Full metal jacket is one film with two completly sides of same coin,first part in military camp is absolutly great and captivitive and in a lot of moments funnier the any comedy films that were ever realesed and supported by great performance from lee ervey,but second part in vietnam is to similiar for me to other films of that type and it didnt offer a lot of new staff and it felt like another war film,my wish would be that whole film was based on military camp that way it would be a lot more engaging and enterteining,my final score first part great,second part solid"
Barry_the_Baptist,"Jul 1, 2002",10/10,"This film is primarily about the dual nature of man: the primal instinct to be destructive and nihilistic versus the social instinct to desire peace. The destructive and creative forces of man pitted against each other is a theme common to many of Kubrick's films particularly ""A Clockwork Orange"". I rank this film above the grossly overrated ""Platoon"" simply because Kubrick says more about war than the trite cliche of 'war is hell'. Many people criticized Kubrick for opting to shoot the film on a sound stage in England. This issue is irrelevant to the message and content of the film. Kubrick dodged the typical depictions of the Vietnam war such as the drug use and the jungle warfare. Kubrick chose to focus on the city patrols. Matthew Modine is brilliant as the confused hero certainly more interesting and convincing than CHARLIE SHEEN in ""Platoon"". Most notable is the brilliant use of music in the film as well as the stellar camera work typical to all Kubrick epics. Lee Ermey is amazingly realistic  as the hard drill sergeant. See this Vietnam film and this one only. Unless of course you want to rent ""Platoon"" and ""The Green Berets"" and cry your eyes out with laughter."
damianphelps,"Aug 31, 2020",9/10,"The reason I only gave this 9 and not a 10 is the second half of the film isn't quite as good as the first and the first is movie making at its best.This film is about the mental turmoil of war, preparing for it and then enduring it.We see into the hearts and minds of the soldiers as they try to process what they are experiencing, learning what they are and are not capable of doing to another human being.The movie is uncompromising in its delivery and is better for it.This is not comic book style war making, this is blood, guts, pain and despair. No glorification, no concealing the ugly, just epic movie making."
CrawlingEye,"Jan 31, 2004",N/A,"No matter how well a movie is made, there are certain things that I remember about Viet Nam that can never be brought to the people that have never been in war. All the war movies that I watched or all the training in Boot camp never prepared me for the fact that very few of the people, both us and them, that were killed in the jungle, were recovered in a timely fashion. The dead were left to rot until hostilities stopped. This usually was a long time, and the memories of what they looked liked and the smell, will never be forgotten. This to me brought home the real horror of what we where doing to them, and what they did to us. There are more descriptive memories I could write here, but this isn't the place.S.J. Morales-Chandler Capt.U.S.A.F. Ret."
johnfos,"Jun 12, 2005",7/10,"I really like the way that the Late Stanley Kubrick gives us several movies in one. He did it with 2001 and he's done it again with Full metal Jacket. This really is the hallmark of a great Director...Part One runs for the first 40 minutes of the movie and is set in the USMC Recruiting Depot in South Carolina. It deals with basic training, where Gunnery Sargeant Hartman teaches men to love their rifles: to sleep with them and give them a girl's name. The whole training routine is dehumanising, and Private Pyle cracks under the pressure. This was the most interesting part of the movie for me, focusing on the psychology of war.Part Two is set in Vietnam and deals with the politics of war, the nightmare of combat in the field, and the impact on the local people.The dialogue is spiked with scathing humour, but this is a dark movie which doesn't avoid harsh realities, and it seems appropriate when the end credits roll over a black screen and The Stones sing 'Paint it Black'."
sim-richmond,"Sep 29, 2012",7/10,"The first part of the movie was a great idea to start the whole film. It already was able to make an action-packed atmosphere that you know will go more intense as the movie progresses.Like my favorite movie Pearl Harbor which used to be an action-drama, I like the fact that the producers of this film ""Full Metal Jacket"" also put a touch of drama in it through the person of Private Pyle. It was a very effective style of putting drama in it other than romance which was made into effect on the movie Pearl Harbor.However, I gave this movie only a score of 7 because I don't find the second part of the movie, which was after the training inside the camp, interesting. It was somehow generic and is usual.Great job, though!"
lhhung_himself,"Jul 27, 2002",4/10,"Kubrick must rank with Hitchcock as the most overrated director of our time. Full Metal Jacket is one of his pretentious half-failures. The first part of the movie is quite compelling. The real-life drill sargeant is so good that we overlook the fact that the other characters might as well be carrying cardboard sandwiches with what symbol they are supposed to represent. The second part of the film is supposed to, I think, contrast the chaos and reality of the battlefield to the order and artificiality of the parade ground. This was done beautifully in Kurosawa's two masterful scenes in Ran. Needless to say, Kubrick is no Kurosawa, and is not up to the task. The man has no understanding of how to shoot an action sequence, or how real people, not symbols interact. This artificiality, which was tolerable in the first part makes the second part completely laughable. I once saw a very good snippet of Godard (himself vastly overrated..), comparing shot by shot, the sniper scene with real footage from Vietnam and lamenting upon how static, sterile, and lacking in excitement the Kubrick version is. I think all the weaknesses are summarized in the ""surprise"" climax of the film which I found to be completely out of place and as dated as the film and its director. The years have been much kinder to Platoon, or even Apocalypse Now."
Rurextrexx34,"May 22, 2020",10/10,"Wow. A War film done by Kubrick is the best. In fact, I was so traumatized by the experience that the next time I went to see it. Then years later, I saw the movie again when I was about 23-years old and I absolutely fell in love. The acting is incredible. The music is something that's stayed with me for years. Although, that's partly because I've watched this movie at least 15 times since I fell in love with it. Great movie with great attempt to SHOW WAR for what it truly is and I absolutely 1000000% recommend it to any war movie fans.10/10"
Kubris,"May 28, 2012",9/10,"IMDb Top 250: 87Like Joker's view of men, Full Metal Jacket is filled with duality: in the plot, structure, characters and theme. The only singular conclusion that can be drawn is that it is a great film, one of Kubrick's best.Famously FMJ follows Private Joker's time in boot camp, and then part of his experience in Vietnam during the Tet Offensive. Primarily the film is about 'dehumanization', saying that the war experience strips men of their identities. But, unlike many, many war films, this is not in tandem with the message of ""war is bad"". I found that Full Metal Jacket doesn't choose to suggest that nature or civilians suffer, or convey the futility of war, but instead to primarily push that the soldiers involved lost a part of their humanity. I also fond the film to be decidedly pro- war, at least in comparison to films. This is suggested by the attitude of the soldiers, shown laughing and joking with each other, shooting up the bad guys with upbeat rock n' roll playing.I'm not saying Kubrick was pro- war, as he has made several films with opposite intentions, but that this is an interestingly refreshing angle for a war film.Characters are a key strength here, with a very colourful cast. Most notably and iconic is Hartman with his incredible insults. Of course he's scary and dominates every scene for the first half of the film, but some of his material is very funny, like his view on Texans and Lawrence (of what, Arabia?). I'd comment on the extraordinary script here, but R. Lee Ermey improvised many of his lines. But the script is excellent, with the film summary being a favourite quote of mine. Hartman's tone, scary and funny, is present throughout, wavering constantly, as the line between light and heavy material is often straddled.Our protagonist is nicknamed Private Joker, and that's all we really learn about him. He's the straight character in this zany world, levelheaded and intelligent. I'm reminded of Nick from The Great Gatsby, but more likable and witty. But not even worldly Joker is safe from the effects of the war he observes in others.Then there's poor, Private Pyle. All Hartman wanted to do was weed out the weak, to avoid sending the unprepared into the heat of combat. He was tough, very tough, probably too tough, as shown by the comparison between Hartman and Joker's teaching methods. However he was excellently acted and believably led to the shocking conclusion.I've forgot to mention with the past several Kubrick films how technically strong they are, but I can't avoid it with this one. The sets are lively, the sound is booming, the costumes have personality and the cinematography is strong. It's difficult to believe the whole thing was shot in Britain.Full Metal Jacket is one of the best war movies ever made, affecting its viewers in a way I can't quite understand. This is one of Kubrick's finest, and one of the most prolific pieces of pop culture he made. Witty, somber, outstanding. 9.0/10"
AvidClimber,"Jun 8, 2013",10/10,"Full Metal Jacket is Vietnam war movie by Stanley Kubrick and it is a masterpiece.The good. The mood is set to perfection with the exemplary score and the smooth pacing of the scenario. The story is done in two part, you get to see the ongoing effect of the training as it happens and its result in the field. It is personal, it is gripping, and psychologically brutal. A clear picture of what it is to become a soldier and what it requires on the field. Great photography and editing. Solid dialogs.The actors. Matthew Modine is in one of his best role, presenting a steadfast young man with the rare quality necessary to get through marine training with all his head. A young Vincent D'Onofrio, almost unrecognizable, gives us a performance of a lifetime with incredible realism. R. Lee Ermey is the quintessential army drill sergeant, a perfect performance. Adam Baldwin plays a shallow role, but gives it his best.The bad. Nothing.The ugly. Giving loud orders in an echoing building while sneaking on an enemy. It's the only error of the flick.The result. An excellent war movie. Not for the faint of heart."
epicbrowniez,"Oct 10, 2020",10/10,I have researched it so many times along with the shining and a clockwork orange r lee ermy is hilarious as the drill sergeant and the movie itself is dark.
cashbacher,"Apr 4, 2020",10/10,"The star of this movie is the drill instructor (D.I.) for the boot camp attended by the group of men that signed up for the United States Marine Corps. He is always verbally and occasionally physically savage to the men as he pulls apart their feelings and turns them into automatons that are at one with their rifles. It is interesting that Lee Erney, the man that played the D.I., was in fact a drill instructor during the Vietnam War and much of his dialog was ad lib. When the men are in boot camp, there are times when you empathize with them.
The war action is just as gritty, the last section of the movie is set in the Vietnamese city of Hue during the Tet Offensive when it was overrun by the North Vietnamese and Viet Cong. The set is so real that once I was done watching the movie, I went to a search engine to find out where the scenes were shot. I have watched actual footage of the battle for Hue and the reality is uncanny.
The story follows a group of young men that join the Marines and proceed through boot camp before being sent to Vietnam to fill various roles. After some time in country, a few of them are reunited in the battle for Hue. Despite their now brutal personalities, they show tenderness towards each other as only fellow soldiers in battle can.
This is a great movie that shows war at the lowest levels and male camaraderie in its' highest form."
