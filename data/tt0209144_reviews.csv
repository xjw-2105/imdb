ruffinelli_ro,"Apr 4, 2009",9/10,"If the director of this independent film tried to make us feel really confused, like the main character, he did it wonderfully. There are only a few movies like this one, the kind of movies that makes you pay attention to every minute of it. Obviously that doesn't work all the time, but this case is the exception. Really well directed with a wonderful photography and excellent cast. The main actors' performances are great. We really root for the guy as we hate the ones who try to take advantage of him.Original films like this one always stand out. Perhaps it didn't caught much attention at first but now it is in an important position at the IMDb top 250 and that means that most the people recognize great movies when they see them.As I said before, this movie is a little confusing because it runs backwards while the black and white scenes run in chronological order. But that wasn't a cheap trick to make the movie more ""intelectual"", it was its strength. A rare film that shouldn't be missed."
soloyoda,"Apr 19, 2001",N/A,"Thank Goodness I didn't read the reviews posted before I saw the film!! Most reviews (including ones on this site) will tell you waaayyyy too much about the movie, and that's just plain frustrating.  But, as an avid cinephile, I promise not to do the same.Memento is one of those pictures that will have you sitting in the theater after the lights come up so you can talk to everyone else about what they thought of the movie.  This is a highly intelligent and original brain teaser that will have you guessing from beginning to end, and even afterwards.  The story and the direction are the best I've seen so far this year, and it deserves all the kudos it gets.Plainly put, the film tells the story of Leonard Shelby:  a man who lost his short term memory in an assault where his wife was raped and murdered;  now he's looking for the killer, despite his handicap.  Simple as that.  You don't need to know anymore.The film is constructed and told in such a way that you are constantly put into the shoes of Leonard Shelby, beautifully played by Guy Pierce. Carrie-Ann Moss gives an equally mysterious and complex performance.  This film is well-made all the way around--from the direction, to the editing, and especially the unique story that is rarely found in Hollywood these days.  Four Stars!This review may have been a little dry on the details, but go see the movie--you'll be thanking me later.PS: Only go to the official website AFTER you've seen the movie.  It too will give too much away.  Afterwards, though, go and look at it--it's pretty impressive."
Old Joe,"Feb 6, 2003",10/10,"Losing your memory would have to go close to one of the worst experience anyone could ever suffer from. In the movie Memento', we get to see how bad it is to suffer from short term memory loss. It also gives us the chance to see how far a patient of such a disease will go to remember what is most important to him. In the vain of Pulp Fiction', Memento is a movie that has to be seen to be believed. It is no wonder that this movie is so popular with the movie going public around the world.Leonard Shelby wears expensive, tailored suits, drives a late model Jaguar sedan, but lives in cheap, anonymous motels, paying his way with thick wads of cash. Although he looks like a successful businessman, his only work is the pursuit of vengeance: tracking and punishing the man who raped and murdered his wife. The difficulty of locating his wife's killer is compounded by the fact that Leonard suffers from a rare, untreatable form of amnesia'. Although he can recall details of life before his accident' Leonard cannot remember what happened fifteen minutes ago, where he is, where he is going, or why.Christopher Nolan has made one great (but confusing) movie. His style in directing and editing Memento' is quite unique, as no movie has ever been made quite like it before. The story being told in a backward kind of motion makes the audience have to think hard about what they are watching. It also makes the audience feel for a guy like Leonard, whose condition only gets worse and worse as the movie goes on. I am almost 100% sure that Nolan and his brother Jonathan, made up this story in the realisation that it was meant to be confusing. What is also cleverly done by Nolan is the use of black and white and then colour shots. In my opinion, the variations in these shots are used so it confuses the audience even more.Guy Pearce's role in Memento' shows me why he is so successful in Hollywood today. Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, a man on the hunt for his wife's killer. The only problem is that Shelby is suffering from anterior-grade amnesia', a disease that cannot be treated. With Lenny', I feel the audience suffers partly the same condition as he does, and partly does not, as we can remember what has happened in the present.Memento's other main stars include corrupt cop Teddy' (Joe Pantoliano). A friend said of Pantoliano's performance in Memento, he was perfect for the role of Teddy', as he comes across as the mysterious bad guy'. I could not agree more. There is also the character of Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) who is a lot like Teddy in her own way. What is similar about these characters is the way they use Leonard's condition to advantage their own situations.Other characters include Sammy Jenkis (Stephen Tobolowsky), who is a victim we learn about from an old case when Leonard Shelby was an insurance investigator. There is Leonard's wife, Catherine (C.S.I.'s Jorja Fox) who is another fascinating character. Although we do not hear her say much, she is a vital part of this most confusing story. Add in the funny role of Burt (Mark Boone Jnr.), the motel clerk, who openly admits to Lenny that he is ripping him off, by giving him two rooms, but that he will not remember it happening anyway.Yet in no way do any of the characters in Memento' realise they are in a time reversed movie. I am sure that many of the performers would have had to read their scripts many times to understand what was happening from a cinematic point of view. But from an acting prospective, this would have been an easy experience to be part of. Memento also has some interesting devices to tell the story. The way Leonard tries to remember things in the present and the future, via notes tattoos and photographs, making them an important element within the movie. Without them, our hero would not be able to remember anything.Nonetheless, memory is the most vital element in this movie, because without it, people are confused, isolated and abused, which is what happens to our hero', Leonard.  As Lenny mentions early on in the film, ""Memory's unreliable ... Memory's not perfect. It's not even that good. Ask the police; eyewitness testimony is unreliable ... Memory can change the shape of a room or the colour of a car. It's an interpretation, not a record. Memories can be changed or distorted, and they're irrelevant if you have the facts.""  But it has to be ironic that Leonard is the one who narrates Memento', when his recollections and memories of events are inaccurate and jaded. There are also some powerful scenes in Memento'. The one which sticks in my mind the most' has to be where Natalie abuses Leonard, calling his dead wife a whore', snorting smartly that you won't be even able to remember what I have said'.So, if you watch this movie and it confuses you the first or even the second time, I can assure you that is how you are meant to feel, confused. If you hated watching Memento' the way Christopher Nolan intended, then I can only recommend that you get a hold of the DVD and watch it in chronological order, as it will really help you. Memento also shows how bad mental disease' patients can be abused by healthy people and what lengths sick patients will go to try and keep sane'. Also, if a movie makes you think, then in some way it has been successful in doing something that many movies do not do  making you think. Those sorts of cinematic experiences are the ones that we need to cherish for life, as they are few and far between. Memento is one such experience.CMRS gives Memento': 5 (Brilliant Movie)"
adamp-6,"Jan 31, 2002",10/10,"I saw ""Memento"" in the early afternoon, a fact for which I am thankful. Why?  Because it then proceeded to dominate the majority of my thoughts for the rest of the day.  That night I lay in bed, tossing and turning, my mind trying to wrap itself around the story, and I absolutely could not GO TO SLEEP!I finally just gave up on sleep, got up around midnight, and watched ""Election"" to cleanse my palate.  Then I went back to bed and starting contemplating ""Memento"" AGAIN.  Finally, out of sheer exhaustion, I went to sleep.This is a movie that gets in your head and will not get out until you figure it all out.  And that can only be done with extensive internet research. Reading ""Memento Mori"", the short story upon which the movie is ""based"" helped, too.""Memento"" is nothing short of a phenomenon.  And a brilliant one at that."
RobTheWatcher,"Feb 17, 2023",7/10,"Memento is a one of a kind film that to me felt like it didn't quite live up to the hype and reviews. The cinematography itself was superior and the way it filmed was extremely unique and had never been done before which I appreciate. But for how unique and different it was, it was equally confusing and just all over the place. I felt the movie lost your attention and just lacked an overall synergy. The story line was cool and there was a lot of mind bending moments that made you think but I just think this movie could've been redone and been better than it ended up being. Worth the watch regardless still."
lasher42,"May 24, 2001",10/10,"So the ""innovative"" concept of filming out of sequence has been cliche for at least a few years now, but here's a film that makes it work far better than its been shown in a while.Having read the reviews and talked to others who saw it, I thought that I'd go into the movie figuring everything out right away and declaring the concept unworkable.  I couldn't be further from the truth.  This movie does things to your head that are illegal in some countries.  Portrayed (for all intents and purposes) backwards, it forces you to think in the same way that our lead character, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce being more brilliant than usual) does.  Suffering from a condition that renders him unable to remember anything for more than a few minutes, he is searching for the man who raped and killed his wife.  Since each seen lasts no more than 15 minutes before jumping back to the what happened before that, our perceptions are shattered in the same way.Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano (both of The Matrix) put in great performances that leave you guessing; simultaneously endearing and revolting.Overall I left the film trying to figure out what was what, and I'm still not sure.  This film noir concept shouldn't work, but it does so wonderfully."
ma-cortes,"Jan 17, 2025",6/10,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) lost his short-term memory after the attack and forgets all current events every 15 minutes, or so. He remembers his life prior to the incident, such as being an insurance claims investigator. Problem solved as Shelby tatoos the most vital info all over his body and leaves less permanent clues for himself on Post-its and Polarods of the usual suspects. He has learned to cope with his memory loss through dealing with a man named Sammy Jankis (Stephen Tobolowsky) , a person he investigated professionally who also had short term memory issues. The action thereafter plays forwards as usual - with Leonard out to track down and take revenge on whoever raped and killed his wife. Shelby meets Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) who may want to help him, but like his own memory , definitely can't be trusted. Some memories are best forgotten !.Twisty and and engaging thriller of a man searching for his wife's killer in Los Angeles. Ingeniously constructed flick is told backwards, from Guy Pearce's shooting of the killer to his puzzle-like construction of happenings and renders the audience as clueless as the impaired hero. There's grade A work from all concerned , especially main star, Guy Pearce. Clever use of flashbacks and black and white segments help define events in time. More than usually required mental exercice is more than worth the effort. This taut and ingenious thriller displays interest in how perception and memory shape identity , action and, of course, filmic storytelling. Filmmaker Christopher Nolan adapted the movie from short story: ¨Memento Mori¨ by brother Jonathan Nolan. Interpretations are pretty good, such as Guy Pearce as Leonard Shelby who has short term memory loss resulting from an injury he sustained which was associated with the murder of his wife, along with Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano, Mark Boone Junior, Jorja Fox and Stephen Tobolowsky.It contains a mysterious and unusual score by David Julyan. As well as a colorful and adequate cinematography by Wally Pfister, Nolan's regular. The motion picture was decently written and directed by innovator director Christopher Nolan, though inferior than other own films . Nolan was recognized by his peers with D. G. A. And P. G. A. Award nominations, as well as a W. G. A. Award for his works . Among its many honors, Nollan has received four Academy Awards and eight nominations, including Best Picture and Best Screenplay. Christopher Nolan is a prestigious author of various masterpieces: ¨ Insomnia¨ , ¨The Prestige¨ , ¨Batman begins¨, ¨The Dark Knight¨ , ¨The Dark Knight Rises¨, ¨Dunkirk¨, ¨Tenet¨, among others . Rating : Above average 6.5/10 , it was throughly entertaining and exciting, and no as predictable as you would think . The film results to be a complete pleasure to watch these actors at this work , it's highly recommended and keep you guessing until final ."
QuandaleDingleMan,"Jul 12, 2025",5/10,"I went into Memento knowing it had a big reputation-it's often talked about as one of the best thrillers of the 2000s, and I'd heard a lot about its reverse storytelling. I'll admit, the structure is clever. Telling the story backward definitely puts you in the mindset of the main character, Leonard, who suffers from short-term memory loss. It's an interesting way to make the audience feel his confusion and disorientation.From a technical perspective, I understand why people admire it. The editing is tight, the non-linear narrative is handled with skill, and Guy Pearce gives a solid performance. Christopher Nolan clearly had a bold vision, and I respect the creativity it took to put something like this together.That said, I still walked away feeling underwhelmed. While the concept is innovative, the story itself didn't really grab me. I kept waiting for a payoff that never quite delivered. I'm still unsure about the ending, and not in a ""mind-blown"" kind of way, but more like it didn't fully make sense or stick the landing. The mystery felt more confusing than satisfying.Also, as much as the structure is praised, I felt like it was doing a lot of the heavy lifting. Once you strip away the reversed timeline, the plot is decent but not amazing. I didn't feel especially connected to any of the characters, and emotionally, it left me pretty cold.Overall, I don't think Memento is a bad film-it's well-crafted, original, and thought-provoking in parts. But for me, it felt more like an intellectual exercise than a compelling story. It's clearly not a movie for everyone, and unfortunately, I'm one of those people it just didn't click with."
quixoboy,"Sep 1, 2003",N/A,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is truly a rare and exceptional achievement in modern filmmaking in that it manages to be new, fresh, hip, and exciting without ever tiring its audience out - unless you're walking into this film without the desire to participate and actively analyze the mysterious details.If that's the case, then this is DEFINITELY not a movie you should see. If, on the other hand, you are open-minded, creative, and alert, you'll definitely appreciate and get a kick out of this one. ""Memento"" is an old-fashioned ""film noir""-type mystery thriller with an intriguing, ingenious twist: outfitting the entire film with a style that mirrors the protagonist's own mental condition while giving the poor viewer(s) his own perspective as well. It is masterfully filmed and edited in such a way that it is chronologically presented backwards (with two initially separate, parallel storylines - the main one, shot in colour, is the chronologically-backwards story with scenes that intercut with those of the other story, which is filmed more like a documentary, shot in black & white, and mostly takes place inside a motel room with the main character narrating, talking about the effects of his condition, etc.) While the average viewer may already be put off by such a complicated, confusing format, it is a very original premise that is well worth the struggle to figure out.Acting is solid across the board, as is the writing, directing, etc., but special kudos must be extended to the very talented editor Dody Dorn, who successfully managed to put all of these fragments together and help them flow in a smooth, healthy manner that is not easy to pull off.One of the most ""memorable"" (sorry, couldn't help slipping in the bad joke) films you're likely to ever see, ""Memento"" is an instant classic due to its groundbreaking narrative style and impressive dramatic undertones. For those jaded moviegoers who seek something to keep them awake, interested, and constantly thinking, there couldn't be a better choice than this film."
jbparker,"May 9, 2001",9/10,"Yes, it's true.  The entire movie is based on a gimmick.  However, I honestly feel that this does not cheapen the picture in the slightest bit. I loved every scene; discovering information as our lead character discovered it. It demands a second and third viewing, as there are many subtleties and quick flashes that may not be picked up on the first time around.  Its one of the most original films ever made, and for people who scoff at the concept of not having a short-term memory, it actually is a real condition. Watch this movie. And, please pay attention. The performances are wonderful, and its structured magnificently."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 22, 2017",10/10,"Christopher Nolan has always struck me as a very talented film-maker, and most of his films are ones that have impressed me a lot. Even weaker efforts, where his ambition can get in the way, have a good deal to admire. His films are all impeccably crafted technically, and often entertaining and thought-provoking, also knowing how to get good performances out of talented casts.'Memento' was not his first film, having directed 1998's 'Following', but has been considered by many the film that rose him to fame and brought the world's attention to him. Cannot disagree with this, and also that not only is 'Memento' his first great success but seventeen years later it gets my vote as his best film. It really makes one think hard about what is happening, crucial in a film where a lot of concentration is needed, without being treated like you are an idiot or dumber than you are. It is also one of the few Nolan films where it was difficult to find anything to fault.As always with Nolan, 'Memento' is a wonderfully made film. The cinematography is slick and the production values in general are suitably gritty and audacious , with some scenes strongly reminiscent of film noir (as a fan of film noir that was great to see). David Julyan's synthesised (something that could have sounded tacky but actually adds a lot to the atmosphere) score makes very clever and dynamic use of distinct sounds, oppression, yearning, loneliness and loss having a haunting but also affecting vibe, the feeling of being lost adrift being perfectly captured.Nolan directs impeccably, not letting his ambition get in the way of the storytelling, while the script is smart, thought-provoking and intricate without trying too hard and treating the audience with respect. The pacing is taut while deliberate, and the length, after seeing some later efforts that have suffered from over-length and over-ambition ('Interstellar'), was ideal.It is the story that makes 'Memento' Nolan's most fascinating film, with a unique non-linear, time-reversed structure with two converged time-lines. That sounds on paper confusing but with Nolan telling the story in an intricate, tense and atmospheric way (meaning that he takes his time telling the story) it makes perfect sense, with beautifully interwoven use of thematic motifs of memory, guilt, perception, self-deception and grief and a stunningly moving ending that one does not expect.Guy Pearce is astonishing and give one of his career's best performances, don't think from personal view that he's been as good as this since. He gets excellent support from particularly Joe Pantoliano and even Carrie-Ann Moss.Overall, a brilliant film and a contender (my personal vote certainly) for Nolan's best film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
cjholland,"May 15, 2001",10/10,"Incredible, riveting and powerful.  What else could I say?  This movie has all of the qualities of classic film noir as well as the magnitude of an original, unique concept that has been tried and tired before but works here.Guy Pearce has been underrated for years (just think back now to Priscilla and can you believe this is the same guy) and finally might get the recognition here that was at least well-deserved of him back for LA Confidential.  Powerful perfomances, well developed story with suspensful buildup of what our main character pieces together little by little makes this a must see.Easily in my top 100 of all time."
alexclover,"Jul 10, 2001",7/10,"The majority of people on this comments board attribute this film's success to its very original editing style. The film is built upon this style, showing you a present-time snippet of the main character which leaves you wondering about why he got there and what he's doing. The film then continues showing you a snippet of the immediate preceding past of the main character, and so on backwards in time helping you understand the beginning of the film. That's where the movie's originality stops. The plot itself is filled with huge holes. While the premise is interesting, it is hardly plausible that someone with no short-term memory would not be 'assisted' by society in any way, nor that he could not have a notebook handcuffed to him or something rather than all the tattoos. I found the movie rather predictable and did not really care about the movie after about halfway through.Still, an interesting and innovative movie-making style with a neat, if unplausible, situation for the main character. This coupled with sometimes very unconvincing acting by the main actor (although it is a hard role, he never really pulls it off) and a wholly boring plot earns this movie a 7 in my book.If you want to see a real whodunnit type movie that will haunt you for a long time to come, try Thesis by Spanish director Almenabar which I saw last night and save Memento for a day you want to study film rather than enjoy it."
Movie-12,"May 2, 2001",8/10,"MEMENTO / (2001) ***1/2 (out of four)By Blake French:How is this for a scenario? A man breaks into your house in the middle of the night. He kills your wife and leaves you with brain injuries. Furious, you pledge your life to track down and kill whoever is responsible. There is just one problem: after the head injury, you are no longer capable of creating new memories; everything before the accident is crystal clear, but now you cannot remember anything past several minutes.Now chew on this: what happens to guilt if you cannot remember what you did? How can a person have emotions if he does not know where they came from? How can we learn from our experiences if we cannot remember them. What is the purpose of revenge if someone cannot recollect or prosper from it?""Memento"" wins this year's prize for inducing the most audience participation. Not only is the film thought-provoking and unusually absorbing, but it also places us in the main character's shoes. How can we be in the same mental status with the main character when he cannot remember anything? Writer/director Christopher Nolan has that answer: he tells the story backwards. We begin at the end and work our way towards the beginning. However, each individual scene plays running forward, often overlapping, providing us with clear, constructive transitions. The main character, Leonard, is confused in prospects of time and experience, and so are we.Other characters include Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss, from ""The Matrix""), who also lost someone close and can help Leonard, and Teddy (Joe Pantoliano, also from ""The Matrix""), whose identity often shifts mysteriously. Then there is the series of flashbacks of Leonard's experiences while working as an insurance agent. The situation involves an individual named Sammy, who has a memory disorder similar to Leonard's. His diabetic spouse is not sure whether her husband is faking his condition or not. To prove it to herself she arranges a test I dare not reveal. Leonard is more intricately involved in this story than he even believes.""Memento"" is smart and imaginative. It doesn't pass up little details of the characters. Leonard is constantly jotting himself notes and taking Polaroid pictures so his life can make some sense. He even gets permanent tattoos all over his body so he does not lose or forget some of the most important information.In a movie like this, it would be almost impossible to make without leaving some information out; even some of the film's actors were confused and requested a script told in sequence order. But these filmmakers have constructed a movie with a plot hole big enough to drive a semi through: If Leonard cannot remember anything after the accident, then how can he remember that he has a memory condition? There are no tattoos or notes to remind him, and whenever he meets someone he explains his condition thoroughly. This is necessary information he reveals, but there are better ways to do so. We could be there when his doctor explains the condition to him, or see his friends talking about it. The sky is the limit in a movie like this. It was not essential to leave such a massive, obvious hole in the plot.""Memento"" is still a unique mystery thriller. It is a tantalizing experience we do not often come across at the movies. For audiences who like to sit back and relax, this film is a waste of time. It requires us to follow along, participate, fit puzzle pieces together-""Memento"" doesn't provide any easy or obvious answers. All but the most intelligent and thoughtful kids will not be able to follow this film; it is intended for adult audiences. ""Memento"" is one of the year's most challenging movies, not to be missed if you are looking for something clever and original."
noahk,"Nov 2, 2001",5/10,"Another cleverly done example of backwards story telling, from the Pulp Fiction school..  Unlike Pulp Fiction, the backwards element got annoying and tiresome fast in this film.  It certainly was a creepy film, maybe even affecting (time will tell, since I just watched it), but I didn't find it all that enjoyable.  The ending was unsatisfying for me, after sitting through the previous hour and fifty minutes (yes, I found myself watching the clock to count down when it would wrap up).  I suppose I could get a bit more out of it with repeated watchings, but I don't really care enough to bother with that.  I would give this one a 5/10, although few of you will probably agree with me so let the flames begin!"
inkblot11,"Sep 2, 2021",10/10,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) has a terrible problem. After his wife was murdered and presumably he was beaten, he has no short term memory. His last recollection is the moments before his wife's demise. Now, he is determined to track down the killer the police couldn't find. Yet, everyday he must read his notes and gaze at the many tattooed phrases on his body so that he can continue. Two people appear to be helping him in his quest. One is a man named Teddy, who pops around all the time but seems rather shady. Equally so is a Natalie (Carrie Anne Moss) who is sleeping with Leonard but may have ulterior motives. Meanwhile, Leonard stays at a cheap Los Angeles Hotel where the manager introduces himself every day and, underhandedly, adds to Leonard's bill. As he crisscrosses the city looking for the murderer, the film also flashes back to his time as an insurance investigator to give us more clues. For you see, this film is designed to force the viewer to piece together the plot, bit by bit! Are you game? I finally saw this fantastic Nolan film that everyone raves about incessantly. Its worthy of the highest praise as the plot travels backwards, forwards, and sideways. Pearce is wonderful as the main character, but, one quibble, I'm not fond of him as a blonde. The supporting cast is also superb with few big names except Moss. The setting in Los Angeles has its splendors and its dives. Memento is a huge cut above most other film experiences. While you are guaranteed to be confused at times, the whole experience is very, very rewarding."
Boba_Fett1138,"Sep 12, 2005",10/10,"Every now and then, an original concepts gets turned into an highly original movie. ""Memento"" is a fine example of original movie-making at its very best.It's impossible to fully describe what this movie is about. Best thing is to watch this movie with a clear head in order to follow the movie. But even then some parts of the movie remain confusing. Because of this ""Memento"" is a perfect movie to watch multiple times, every time you will discover a new fact or things like that. The story is told beautifully and highly original with flashbacks and jumps in time. Basically the whole same story is told over and over again but every time you get to know a little bit of more information. Sounds confusing doesn't it? Well, don't say I didn't warned you...Christopher Nolan provides this movie with a brilliantly suiting visual style and directs the movie with lots of flair and pace. Truly a good young director of which we will hear way more in the near future. He also already made real fame by the 'casual' movie viewer by directing the stylish blockbuster hit ""Batman Begins"". Not only is he a great director, he also is a great writer.The acting in the movie is really solid. Guy Pearce is a great leading man and he is supported by some wonderful actors in the supporting cast: Carrie-Anne Moss, Joe Pantoliano.Because that the movie and its story are so original you never know what is going to happen next. It's a typical independent movie, without any clichés or other distracting elements. Yet the movie is more accessible then it sounds. Every person should be able to appreciate this movie and be absolutely captivated by it.An unique movie experience that is highly recommendable to everyone!10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
alexismaria02,"May 10, 2020",10/10,"This is by far the greatest work by Chris Nolan. Everything about this particular film is simply astonishing and you could see it from a mile away. The superb writing is out of this world. There is no other movie like Memento, no other movie that could take the audience through such a unique experience. So many emotions are felt throughout this film and still, by the time you've finished it, it will leave you wanting more because that's how great this film is. Not only the writing was perfect, but also the direction part. Nolan did an amazing job in introducing us to this fictional world, that everything felt almost real. The way he combined the black&white scenes with the ""colored"" ones was simply unique. There is nothing like it. Then, the acting was impeccable as well. Although this film might be a bit too difficult to understand for some viewers, there are still a lot of things to enjoy from this experience even if you don't understand the movie completely! As a conclusion, I simply adore and recommend this film with all my heart, because it is without a question one of the greatest and most unique films of all time and this is all thanks to the great Chris Nolan!"
TOXIC-7,"Sep 12, 2000",10/10,"This is by far the most original movie and engaging mystery since the Third Man. Christopher Nolan's storytelling brilliance will captivate audiences with his time twist and flipping of the story's narrative. The structure has been turned upside down and backwards giving us an incredible perspective. The film is one of a kind and it will leave people dumbfounded because of Nolan's craftiness and imagination. Absolutely the best film at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2000. Nolan, has thrusted himself into the category of vanguard filmmakers, along with David Fincher, PT Anderson, Guy Ritchie & Darren Aronofsky."
ccthemovieman-1,"Apr 12, 2007",6/10,"This was ""okay,"" but frankly overrated by the national critics. Because the story ran backwards, I guess that was supposed to be cool or hip or something. If you make things too hard on the audience and most get confused on what's happening, it makes the elitist critics feel good because they ""understand it"" and thus feel superior. It's so much hogwash.Having said, I didn't say I didn't find the movie interesting. I did, and enjoyed the performances of Guy Pearce, Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss. A man with no short- term memory goes back, scene-by-scene, trying to find the killer of his wife. It's a film I saw back in 2001 on VHS and I'd like to see it again, now that six years have passed since then. I understand one of the special-edition DVDs of this showed the movie in the correct time sequence without all the flashbacks. That might have been less-creative, but better.However, be warned: this is a frustrating film to watch for first-time viewers."
mindfreak25,"Dec 15, 2012",8/10,"Excellent movie. This movie shows Nolan's early spirit in movie making, as this is his second feature film. However this is not for everyone. Even if you're a die-hard Nolan fan, you still might not like it. It was in my cup of tea, so I loved it. The movie is a complete mind bender. It doesn't play in order. It jumps from the past to present a TON of times, so it can be a hell lot of confusing. It's a slow movie, but fantastic. It grabs your attention from the start till the end. The suspense builds stronger as every second ticks by. If you haven't seen it go see it now, because in the second part of my review I'm going to talk about the ending. The ending is something to talk about. There is a plot twist at the end, rather twistS. It is one of the most unpredictable twists ever.Spoiler Alert!As many of you have seen the movie, you will know the ending is completely mind blowing. I never expected that Leo had killed the attacker over a year ago, and that now he kept forgetting and believed that the killer is still alive. Also another crazy twist was when Teddy told Leo that Leo's wife survived the attack, and that Leo himself killed her by accident with an insulin overdose. The real shocker was when it was revealed that Leo was mixing Sammy's life with his life. Everything that was said about Sammy, indeed revealed Leo's life. Totally mind blowing. There were like 3-4 twists at the end, which blew me away. To be honest, I didn't even expect one of the twists. I was blown away because there were many twists at the end, and none of them were predictable. From all the movies I've seen this movie had the second biggest twist ending, right after ""The Prestige"", also by Nolan.This movie is very suspenseful and interesting. It doesn't let your interest leave until the very end. In short, fantastic movie and it deserves at least one watch. For me many more watches. Nolan never disappoints. Not one of his movies disappointed me, and I've seen all his movies, including his short films."
Morejambo54,"Jan 17, 2021",7/10,"I like to start my review by saying that I don't think this is an enjoyable movie which doesn't mean it is at all bad, I thought it was very good actually. The story is what stands out, it's very unique and the way it is presented is great although it is rather slow throughout. For me it was a bit boring as it was straight dialogue for two hours, but it did all lead to a dramatic ending which was quite satisfying yet a bit confusing. Most Christopher Nolan movies are quite confusing though so I did expect this when coming into it and I did understand what happened I don't feel like I was truly able to take in so much knowledge in at once and it left me a bit baffled. The acting was pretty good, nothing stood out to me neither did the music used and it wasn't that tense but the idea as a whole was great and that is pretty much the only reason I give this higher than a five, the story. I wish it were showed in a different way or just readjusted to better suit the high percentage of slightly idiotic people watching the movie, which I feel like I fall under that category after watching this. I give this seven for it's cleverness alone."
heejoo,"Feb 4, 2007",5/10,"I just don't understand what it is that makes this movie so popular, especially with male viewers, I mean 8.6? Come on, what is that?! ...Leonard suffers from short-term memory loss and tracks back using notes and body parts to find the man who killed his wife. On his journey he encounters a number of people who he has to be able to assess at first sight because of his deficiency.The acting by Guy Pearce is very convincing and even appealing but the story however is most of the time way too irritating because you constantly have to backtrack yourself in order to completely understand what's going on. I like flashbacks in movies but a film that turns out to be one big flashback by itself may be a little too demanding for me. I guess this is just not my kind of entertainment ..."
richardtownsley-19550,"Jun 16, 2020",10/10,"Memento is probably one of the most unique - and confusing - movies I have ever watched.
Memento does something that few other movies have done before: it is shown backward. There are scenes shown backward, along with scenes shown forward, and the two eventually converge during the climax. And while showing a movie backward may seem like a horrible way to craft a movie, it is everything but. It shows us something that will happen, and shows us how we got there. Whether we like it or not, the ending is inevitable. The movie opens with a murder, and at first, it seems justified; the man raped and murdered the wife of our protagonist, Leonard (Guy Pierce). However, as the movie progresses, or rather digresses, we learn that the man was, in fact innocent. Leonard has a strange case of anterograde amnesia that prevents him from making new memories. Every 5 minutes, he forgets who he is, where he is, and why he is there. As a result,
he uses a complex (but heavily flawed) system of notes and photographs to understand his
everyday life. He relies on these notes to survive, and track down John Doe, the man who raped and murdered his wife. Memento has so many plot twists that it is often hard to keep up with, but in fear of spoiling for you, I will end this review here."
layla_silver7,"Feb 9, 2024",10/10,"Memento is about a man named Leonard (Guy Pearce) who suffers from short-term memory loss. He relies on writing and taking pictures to track down the man he believes is his wife's murderer. Watching the film brings to life the feeling of memory loss and not knowing how you ended up somewhere. The story is told in reverse; one scene will happen, and the next scene will explain how you got to where the previous scene started, and so on. So the thrilling mystery is unraveling for you just as it is for Leonard. Memento is intriguing and psychologically thrilling until the very end, or really, the beginning. The film breaks all the rules of storytelling in such a perfect way that you can't look away. Memento is a must-see for anyone who wants a film like no other."
lee_eisenberg,"Jun 25, 2005",10/10,"""Memento"" is one of those movies that I fear discussing because I don't know how much I can tell without giving the whole thing away. You might have heard that the story gets told in reverse and that Guy Pearce plays Leonard Shelby, who has a memory problem. People are able to abuse him and all sorts of other horrible things. Then, he has to use the little bit of memory that he has left to...no, I can't tell you; it would give the whole movie away. My point is that ""Memento"" is a most incredible movie. You quite literally have to see it to believe it. You might even want to watch it more than once, possibly backwards. Or something similar."
Lucabrasisleeps,"Nov 21, 2008",10/10,"Christopher Nolan is a magician. No other way to put it.This movie ended up on my top ten list when I saw it a few years ago. It is one of the most original thrillers to have come from America and it supposedly became popular solely on the basis of word of mouth.Leonard Shelby(Guy Pearce in an excellent performance) is a man who has short term memory loss. He is a man on a mission. He is determined to find out who killed his wife. He has various ways to remind himself of small facts - writing them on notes and sticking them on the wall, tattooing facts on his body and so on. The story also involves two other characters - Natalie and a man named Teddy who seems to have a shady past. There is also the story of Sammy Jenkis which is told in bits and pieces by Leonard in disjointed scenes. Sammy also had the same problem which led to Sammy being placed in a mental institution.The main feature of this movie is that it goes backwards. Which means that the scene that follows is actually the incident which happens prior to the current situation. This is quite demanding for the viewer and people with short attention spans may not appreciate this movie so much. Repeated viewings may be required to actually understand what is going on in the movie.What I liked about the movie was the fact that despite the complex and confusing style, it is ultimately a movie which is not inaccessible. It is no art film which might bore viewers to tears. It is a fast moving thriller which can keep a viewer hooked and this is what separates Memento from other such complex thrillers. Most importantly, it is the little facts and clues that are the most interesting. The loose ends are tied up expertly at the end with such brilliance that I am still at awe at the execution even several years after watching this movie.Overall, it is in fact quite depressing. There is not one likable character in this movie, except for Leonard, and we see how his medical condition is used by people to serve their own interests. It presents a bleak view of human nature, in many ways.As far as the performances are concerned, Guy Pearce is fabulous as the determined but confused Leonard Shelby. Carrie Anne moss is brilliant as the mysterious Natalie who may have other motives in helping Leonard. She has the right kind of mix of beauty and mysteriousness which make her perfect for the role. Joe Pantaliano as Teddy makes a big impact in this movie. His dry humour and screen presence make this role one of my favourite performances on film.Altogether, it is one of the best films of recent years and it is exactly the kind of movie I like.10/10"
rabidwolf417,"Aug 2, 2007",10/10,"I was totally blown away by this movie. I think this is a total masterpiece. I wish I could have thought of something as ingenious as this. I recommend it to anyone that enjoys a good mystery, acting, editing, directing, plot. I can and have watched it over and over again. This should have won for best picture the year it came out. Go out and rent it. Go and watch it. Go out and buy it. you will not be disappointed. This movie is about a guy who loses his short term memory and tries to hunt down his wife's rapist and killer. I won't say anything else. It is a masterpiece, thought not perfect it probably should be about a 9.8 on the IMDb but I'll give it a 10 out of 10."
dfink32,"Oct 26, 2001",6/10,"There are holes in the plot of this movie that should prevent it from receiving the ranking it has in this database (1 of the top 10 all time best movies). In the end, the characters are not sympathetic or interesting enough to warrant the treatment they get in the film. I do not think this is a must see movie for anyone."
setheisenberg,"Nov 17, 2001",6/10,"Perhaps because this movie was rated SO HIGHLY, my viewing was tainted by unrealistically bolstered expectations. Maybe...There was a strange twist of irony at work here: the more I watched this film the less I liked it. What began as a wonderfully, refreshing look at (reverse) story-telling, became less entertaining and more tedious with each passing (and re-passing) flash-back (or is that flash-forward?)Part of this film played like an old Twilight Zone episode I recall seeing many years ago. And that's not a bad thing. I enjoyed piecing together the ""why"" of the plot, since we already knew the ""what."" However, generally uninteresting and unappealing characters mar the performances, and while our hero may be unaware of time, as a viewer I was painfully aware of how his film seemed to drag, lacking a good sense of timing. As for the ending, it too could have been given the same delicious touches as the beginning sequence, but alas, it does nothing to reward the viewer for having endured the bulk of the film.One reviewer commented how well this HIGHLY RATED film will hold up in another few years when compared to the classics. Others have asked how on earth it could have rated so high to begin with. The former will be answered on its own, and I believe time will not be too kind. The answer to the latter is akin to the McDonald's Syndrome: Those who grew up eating Big Macs on a regular basis erroneously come to believe it's actually good food. Perhaps compared to what Hollywood is offering these days, Memento is indeed gourmet fare. To me, it's still just a hamburger. (6 out of 10)."
thirdi,"Jul 12, 2003",5/10,"Before I rant on the absurdity of Memento being currently ranked #14 on the Top 250 list, I'll say what I liked about it. Yes, it was an extremely entertaining, original and well-done all around film. The acting was first rate, the story decent, and the film makers did a great job putting it all together.However, I may be crazy, and I'm sure the ""film snobs"" will grit their teeth at this, but at the end of the day, isn't Memento just a gimmick? A water cooler novelty? I mean, basically they took a slightly above average plot and did something new, and granted inventive, by editing the film structure in reverse. For the most part, the movie is pretty much shown from end to beginning. Yes, they did enough to make things make sense in between, but essentially it was an exercise in ""hey, let's make a movie, and then edit it so everyone will talk about that reverse movie"".I don't care what anyone says. That's the bottom line, period. I've talked with plenty of fellow movie buffs who I consider to be reasonably intelligent, and some are even the snob-types mentioned above. And none of us can figure out what all the fuss is about. Maybe we ain't that smart.I hate to get into comparisons, because it's difficult to compare different types of movies. But be honest, if you can tell me with a straight face that Memento is an overall better film than ""Apocalypse Now"", ""A Clockwork Orange"", ""Pulp Fiction"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Fight Club"", ""Jaws"", ""Chinatown"", ""Raiders of The Lost Ark"", ""American Beauty"", ""Silence of the Lambs"" and a large chunk of the other 230 films ranked below it, than you just need to sit back, take a deep breath, reel in that massive ""I'm a nonconformist art-house movie aficionado"" thing and get a reality check. It was a good movie, but it wasn't that good."
Pseudo-geordie boy,"Jan 25, 2001",N/A,"If I told you the entire plot of this film it really wouldn't matter as it is an exquisite paean to the subjectivity of memory and therefore is in itself ambiguous; the truth' of it is up to you. You come out of the cinema questioning yourself, your memories, your truths. Nothing in this film is as it seems, and yet paradoxically everything is as it seems. We see everything through Guy Pearce's characters' (Lenny) eyes, unfortunately he has no short-term memory so cannot form new memories. He would have already forgotten the first sentence of this review. He lives in snapshots of life; his only form of memory is his Polaroid camera, just like in the excellent German film Wintersleepers; also (partly) about a short-term memory disorder.In this film Lenny takes snapshots to remember who people are, where he now lives, his car, everything. As you can imagine this is perfect for paranoia, suspicion, uncertainty, confusion, and betrayal. And that's exactly what you get in extreme doses. The difference between this film and Wintersleepers however is that Memento is entirely from Lenny's perspective. This therefore creates an imaginative, creatively unsurpassable film. The film begins where it should end, so far so trite, but here's the beauty, we, like Guy Pearce, learn in fragments what's going on. It is therefore perfect for those who love to second guess what's going to happen, who did what, who's doing what and why. The beauty of this film though is that my interpretation could be so different from yours, and neither of us could be sure whose interpretation is the right one; if there is a right one at all. Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. Another beauty of this film is the way it is filmed and edited. Pieces are shown a number of times with no real linear link between them, just like it would be if we ourselves had a memory disorder, and then they are cut up and edited next to things that happen either before or after it. It's just like holding ten different and linearly distinct Polaroids in your hand and having a short-term memory disorder. Excellent.I'm not even sure if watching it again will make things any less ambiguous, but then who cares? The ambiguity is what makes this a great film, if it wasn't so cut up, or from Lenny's perspective it would be both very short and trite; and lacking in tension, suspense and interest. But as it stands it has all three, isn't trite and says so much about humanity. Oh, and the plot? It really doesn't matter, all you need to know is that everything about this film is indicative of the subjectivity of memory, of our experiences and interpretations of all that happens to us. Nothing will seem as black and white as it did beforehand. It will make you question every memory you have, almost as much as possessing a psychology degree, as I do! So, go and see it: be confused, acknowledge the frailty of all you know to be true, and then imagine the freedom of actually being Lenny, and then the horror of having nothing, nothing but the reliance of a pen and a Polaroid camera to know who you are."
nlytnd_1,"Sep 17, 2013",8/10,"This is a decent movie, it's in no way a masterpiece/classic! People rating this a 10 or a 4 star movie have been fooled to believe the movie is somehow deeper then it actually is. It's actually a very simple movie. When you first watch the movie you aren't sure what's going on (confusion is the intent to kind of give the viewer Leonard's perspective), you believe it's a mystery and are trying to piece things together, but in all actuality, it's not a mystery and there is nothing to really piece together, which is fine, just don't kid yourself that it's some type of mind bender that you as a viewer must figure out. Spoilers At the end of the day, Leonard is constructing these endeavors to give his life meaning...that's the big ahhah moment! So the whole time you're trying to figure out what's going on, the answer is; Leonard is just giving himself something to do. Not that big of a deal. Not a biggie, but the scene where Leonard found out that the Motel Clerk was ripping him off was kind of lame. Wouldn't that be something worth writing down, rather then chuckling about? It's kind of a big deal."
Clintborari,"Mar 3, 2021",9/10,"Memento is a very unique thriller. It's very imaginative, original, and absorbing, and I'm guessing you wouldn't have seen anything quite like it.It demonstrates a very powerful and thought-provoking message that 'we all tell lies to ourselves.The film's structure is told in a non-linear fashion involving two timelines. Ultimately we begin at the end of the story and work our way back to the beginning.It's filmed in both color and black-and-white sequences, with the latter showing the events of Leonard's story in an easier-to-understand, chronological order.At first, it might seem quite difficult to follow and, while as a viewer you are puzzled from the outset, we start to realize that we are meant to feel confused, and disoriented as if were are the one in Leonards's shoes.We have the same feelings, thoughts, and ideas as our main protagonist. This means most of the film is also a mystery to us and left scrambling to put together the scattered pieces of Leonard's past.Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is unable to create new memories. He has short-term memory loss and received this 'condition' after he was hit over the head by a break-in at his home, which led to the rape and murder of his wife.He recalls a case from his Insurance industry days regarding another person with the same 'condition' named Sammy Jankis who he initially believed was faking his condition as Sammy could not learn new things through repetition. And so he recollects techniques such as sticky notes, polaroid photographs, and tattoos to help form his lost memory.Leonard is manipulated, and taken advantage of by many people throughout the film, which gives him little choice but to trust only himself.You develop sympathy for his condition, and what he has to go through each day for the rest of his life.There are so many twists and turns that Memento keeps you guessing, and your mind constantly racing for answers. I think you will be stunned by the ending when all the secrets are finally revealed.Guy Pearce was phenomenal, and this was easily his most memorable role to date. He was assisted by having such a diverse, and powerful role but he makes it his own. You believe him to be the real Leonard Shelby.This is a film that you need to be switched on, and keenly focused on to understand all the little details that make the film bind together. Very similar to 'The Machinist' starring Christian Bale.Take away all background noise, and fully immerse yourself in the story, and I guarantee that you will have an unforgettable experience.9/10."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 18, 2025",8/10,"Leonard, once an insurance investigator, now has a single, obsessive mission: to avenge his wife's death and track down the man responsible. Unfortunately, he suffers from anterograde amnesia - he can't form new long-term memories.Not a film to watch casually - you'll need full attention and maybe a double espresso or two. With its backward structure, you're piecing it together almost as Leonard does, which is part of the fun.It takes a little time to get into, but once you do, you start to appreciate how Leonard's condition shapes everything - the constant frustration, the uncertainty, and the impact it has on his hunt for the killer. Visually, the film is striking, particularly the black-and-white sequences, which lend a certain coldness that perfectly complements the story.It's definitely thought-provoking, skilfully placing you in Leonard's shoes. You feel his frustrations, his moments of blissful ignorance, and the intensity of his singular mission. At times it can be repetitive, but there's purpose in it - and yes, it's confusing. If you're carrying even a hint of brain fog, you'll find yourself hitting the rewind button a few times.Guy Pearce delivers a brilliant performance; I can't imagine this was an easy role to play. He's intense, determined, and somehow almost broken, with only one thing to piece him back together. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are excellent in support.It isn't a film I'd rush back to anytime soon, but I have to admit, I enjoyed it - it definitely held my attention. The cerebral side of things, the performances, and the way it refuses to conform all deserve applause.8/10."
kosmasp,"Sep 16, 2010",10/10,"If you have watched the very first movie done by Mr. Nolan, than yes you have seen this before. Not exactly like this and with quite a few flaws, but if you consider that it was more or less a student film and seeing this, probably nothing more than an exercise on how to do it on a grand scale, than it was more than decent.Nolan is one my new favorite directors and as the rating does show you here, I am not alone. Not that that will convince you he is better than you think he is. Actually you might even not like Memento, for one reason or another. There is people out there who just want to be entertained, when they go watch a movie. And that's not a bad thing. Nor does that mean that if someone likes, say Transformers 2 better than this movie, that he/she has no clue. It's just a matter of taste.I for one, can tell you that this is a movie that merits watching it more than once. And the disc version offers you to watch the movie ... in a different ""order"", which gives you a new unique experience. If you haven't watched it yet, you are in for treat. And don't worry, if you don't understand everything the first time you watch it ..."
jack-online,"Apr 28, 2014",1/10,"The novelty of this movie is supposed to be the shuffled time-line and slowly revealed plot elements. But, neither improve the mildly lackluster story. Rather, they make it an agonizing waste of time.Movies are meant to entertain, or at the very least, to educate. This snoozer does neither. It seems to me merely an exercise in hipper-than-thou pretentiousness. And, so many of the high-ratings coupled with reviews raving over how artistic and original the approach absolutely confirm this by presuming that anyone who doesn't like Momento is somehow incapable of understanding the complexity. Rubbish (both the movie and the smug reviews). If anything, it is they who are incapable of seeing through the hype to know when they've been duped.Yes, I hung in there for the entire movie... only to wish I'd ditched after the first 10 or 15 minutes when I was first inclined to give up on it. And, yes, I do know the difference between art and pretense.Take my advice. If you reach the same impasse shortly into your viewing, BAIL! I give you my permission. You won't be missing a thing."
SnoopyStyle,"Aug 25, 2015",10/10,"Leonard (Guy Pearce) suffers from short term memory loss. His last permanent memory is an attack by two men. He killed the one who killed his wife. The other one escaped after clubbing him in the head. The police dismisses the idea of a second man. He keeps a record of his experiences using tattoos, Polaroids and hidden notes. He has to figure out whether he can trust Natalie (Carrie-Anne Moss) or Teddy (Joe Pantoliano) as he searches for the second man to avenge his wife.Brothers Christopher and Jonathan Nolan announce their arrival with this unique screenplay. The forward-reverse order makes the movie disjointed and confused in a good way. It's a beautiful struggle to figure out the plot. It puts the audience in Leonard's shoes. It's a jigsaw puzzle that Leonard with his memory loss also struggles with."

BrunoFLamino,"Mar 21, 2021",10/10,"Memento is careful, almost always sneaky when delivering necessary information to the viewer, because it is a film told in a non-linear way, which can be confusing, and it is made for that, and also because he wants you to put on Leonard Shelby's shoes .
The ambition to convey what it means to have a recent memory loss to those who watch it is executed perfectly, making all fear, anguish and care grow every time the film takes a step forward.The more you think about it, the more you notice striking details and the size of the film's depth.I don't remember a film so smart, it affects and touches its viewer and manages to be subtly funny at the same time.Memento is, in a way, revolutionary and confirms that Christopher Nolan is one of the best at what he does."
haydenluz,"Apr 15, 2020",10/10,"Christopher Nolan took his brother's short story Memento Mori, and turned it into a serious cinematic masterpiece! No disrespect to Nolan's first piece in The Following, but this is the film that truly jumpstarted his marvelous career. Nolan created this original & nifty narrative, with a creative structure that was so mysterious & witty; with every layer that got peeled back, it got more and more intriguing. Chris Nolan has this knack of always keeping his movies entertaining, with great pacing. One of the best thing's he does is create such a mysterious story, that it has such tremendous rewatch value, that only makes you appreciate the movie that much more. The film is presented as two different sequences of scenes interspersed throughout; a series in black-and-white that is shown chronologically, and a series of color sequences shown in reverse.I'm not the biggest fan of Guy Pearce to begin with, maybe because I never really gave him a fair chance, with watching his movies like, Iron Man 3 & Bedtime Stories, but he really changed my mind here. He puts on a fantastic performance! To back up his performance, was a beautiful script written by Chris Nolan himself. With such an intelligent, and memorable script, Nolan was up for an Academy Award in 2002 for Best Original Screenplay, but came up short to Julian Fellowes who wrote Gosford Park. There was not one boring piece of dialogue within the film, while having it's fair share of powerful quotes.Overall, I'm definitely going to have to rewatch this again to pick up some missing pieces, but this is an absolute must watch!"
AaronCapenBanner,"Aug 31, 2013",7/10,"Christopher Nolan directs this truly original, mesmerizing, though puzzling film featuring Guy Pearce as a man suffering from amnesia, who, along with assistance from co-stars Joey Pantoliano & Carrie Ann Moss, try to unravel his identity, and the events that led up to his amnesia, though they may wish they hadn't...I couldn't give away the secret even if I wanted too, since the film is densely plotted, being revealed layer by layer, with the events told and retold so frequently, that it may be hard to figure it out after only one viewing, so multiple viewings are a must, even though one can take only so much of it at a time! Nonetheless, a most intriguing and fascinating experiment, worthy of Alfred Hitchcock!"
winner55,"May 15, 2007",10/10,"I write this after having to write a bad review of Nolan's ""batman Begins."" ""Memento"". after more than seven years, remains the most important English language film of the 21st century. Into it, Nolan pours all the fundamental problems of film, and the fundamental problems of memory that gave rise to film in the first place.It takes about four viewings to get any grip on this film - yet none of these viewings feel wasted in any way, as though the director has played tricks on us - on the contrary, it is the film's bald-face honesty which leaves us in despair of ever getting just the right handle on all the details and the characters.Its hard to understand how Nolan could have betrayed himself and his vision after this film, by selling out to Hollywood's highest bidders - hopefully, he'll recover and give us the Christopher Nolan film we should expect after seeing this one.But in any event, this remains one of the most important films ever made - brilliantly written, filmed, acted, edited - a necessary companion piece to Welles' ""Citizen Kane"" or Eisenstein's ""Potemkin"" - hopefully, Christopher Nolan will actually direct another film some day...."
ElSupreme,"Feb 14, 2003",7/10,Great the first time but there are inconsistancies noticable after a couple of vewings. But the premice of the movie is great. The backwords time thing makes it difficult to notice inconsistancies. Also Guy Pierce's memory isn't quite eraced in some of the scenes.
chiragrathod09,"Apr 29, 2023",10/10,"Christopher Nolan's ""Memento"" is a riveting exploration of memory and identity that challenges viewers to piece together a fragmented story. Released in 2000, this psychological thriller unravels the tale of Leonard Shelby, a man afflicted with short-term memory loss, who embarks on a quest to find his wife's killer.What sets ""Memento"" apart is its unique narrative structure, unfolding in reverse chronological order. This inventive storytelling technique immerses viewers in Leonard's disorienting experience, making us feel the weight of his condition as we attempt to piece together clues alongside him. The film's meticulous editing and thought-provoking screenplay compel audiences to remain actively engaged, as every detail may hold significant weight in the broader narrative.Guy Pearce delivers a powerful performance as Leonard, capturing the character's desperation and determination with authenticity. The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, adds depth and complexity to the unfolding mystery, each character shrouded in ambiguity and intrigue.Visually, ""Memento"" is striking, with its stark cinematography reflecting the themes of confusion and loss. The haunting score further enhances the film's tone, leaving a lasting impression long after the credits roll.Ultimately, ""Memento"" transcends the typical thriller genre, inviting viewers to reflect on the nature of memory and the subjective nature of truth. It's a film that rewards careful watching and contemplation, solidifying its place as a timeless classic in modern cinema. Whether you're a fan of psychological thrillers or simply appreciate innovative storytelling, ""Memento"" is a captivating ride that will keep you guessing until the very end."
MrskiViletic,"Aug 18, 2020",10/10,"A creative take on a well establish genre which cemented Christopher Nolan as one of the best filmmakers of the 2000's and onward. The story is told in reverse and we as the audience piece together the mystery with the lead character, portrayed brilliantly by Guy Pearce. The script is incredible and filled with lots of twists and turns, it has all of the hallmarks of film noir combined with a fresh and original concept under superb direction. Easily one of the best films of the early 2000's and a must watch."
bastiangonzalezb,"Aug 28, 2022",10/10,"From the literal beginnings of the 21st century comes what will probably go down as one of the top 10 films of the period.Leonard, who seeks revenge for the killing of his wife, suffers from short-term memory loss, not being able to remember anything from about 10 minutes ago. His quest is presented in a, as far as I know, unique structure, assembling the scenes in reverse chronological order and sandwiching them with black & white scenes from an unknown time period (relative to the body of the film).What is so great about this premise? Well, besides being a astounding experiment in montage, it is an incredibly effective way of putting in Lenny's shoes. Every colored scene begins with no context whatsoever, putting the viewer and the main character in the same situation. You can only guess by knowing what will happen next, which is masterfully countered by Nolan with a script that never ceases to amaze, either by smartly including just the needed amount of context for the previous scene (or the next, in the movie's internal chronology), or by changing our perspective of what we just watched (scene at Natalie's house).This is an incredibly technical premise for a film, but it also manages to reach an emotional level. After all, isn't all that hard to imagine the horror of having a condition such as Lenny's. This takes me to the main complain I've seen for this film, which is how surface-level characters may seem, with the film trying to uselessly get a sensitive response from the viewer. While this holds true (for me) for Nolan's future films, such as Inception or Interstellar, I don't think it applies to Memento. As happens with Lenny in his daily living, the viewers don't have the time to know someone in a deeper way than a now-you-make-this-thing-to-get-your-revenge level. Also, his condition makes his quest turn completely trivial and we, as the viewers, can experience this very clearly.Nolan just crafted a film that left me wondering how someone could possibly make such an original thriller, keeping it so complex and, at the same time, so comprehensible. My only reservation. Watching Teddy´s reveal to Lenny, you can see traces that show Nolan as a director which later would heavily depend on exposition, and not the good kind. Otherwise, this is as close to a totally monumental film as you can be. Watching the relationship between the colored and B&W scenes at the ending of the film constitutes one of my favorite moments in cinema, showing the power the medium is capable of achieve as an art form. Together with its heartbreaking ending, this amounts of one of my favorite movies ever.99/100."

Sanjeev-902,"Jul 25, 2025",10/10,"I don't even know how to explain Memento without sounding insane. It's one of the most brilliantly confusing and genius films I've ever watched.At first, I was like, ""Wait... what's happening?"" Then halfway through I realized - that was the point. The structure is reversed, the story unfolds backwards, and you're basically piecing together the mystery with the main character.And wow... Guy Pearce absolutely kills it as Leonard. You feel lost with him, frustrated with him, and when things finally click at the end (or technically the beginning?), your brain just explodes.This isn't a casual watch. You need to focus, maybe even rewatch. But it's 100% worth it. The way Nolan plays with memory, time, and trust - it's genius. Pure storytelling magic.If you're into movies that make you think really hard and then reward you for it - this one's for you."
Zooha-47207,"Aug 16, 2025",2/10,"Memento is often hailed as one of the most intelligent thrillers ever made, but for me, it was frustrating and disappointing. The backwards storytelling, while unique, makes the film difficult to enjoy. Instead of being immersed, I felt like I was watching a gimmick stretched into a full movie. The characters never drew me in, and the whole thing felt more like a technical exercise than a story with emotional weight.I can understand why some people admire it, but personally, I found it overhyped and tiresome. A film that tries too hard to be clever at the expense of real storytelling."
CandidlyCandid,"Mar 13, 2009",N/A,"Memento is one of the most original, and stunning movies I have ever seen. Memento is close to an epic masterpiece. They take a simple plot, and mix it up with all these different chronologically strategies. (This time using several chronologically mixed scenes). One man wanting revenge for those who killed and raped his wife, his memory the only thing stopping him. But Memento takes you through a journey of strategy, notes, pictures, black-mail and surprises. It certainly lives up to the hype, and remains as Nolan's best movie. A guarantee I can almost give to all viewers is that: they'll be things that seem a little mixed up after your first viewing, that's normal. I have watched Memento two times, closely and yet, still they're a few unanswered questions. Memento delivers in all aspects, a intriguingly thriller with an opinionated ending."
ericjcant-1,"Dec 8, 2020",10/10,"Memento is a spectral masterpiece of relentless and poignant visual story telling. It unwinds a fascinating story, walking a fine line between crime-noir and psychological drama, yet with a self-awareness that somewhat reminds me of Bergman's sincerity. That might sound a bit gratuitous to some, but making a film like this, where the script is so strong, requires a solid director who not only facilitates the story correctly, but preserves the presence of the mood and not sanitizing it. Guy Pearce's delivery of the first person narrative is spot-on in tone and with a strangely fascinating pragmatic determinism as we start to understand Leonard's strange existence. I think this story is told perfectly through Nolan's lens, and with a premise that is compelling from its first dark note. I have to give Nolan credit for not making this film something that wraps up a comfortably resolved climax with a bow on top. There are questions that cannot and should not be answered, and this is partially why it leaves the viewer with such a strong and eerie impact. There are only portions of the mystery that can be resolved due to Leonard's condition. Leonard is a character the viewer feels compelled to immediately sympathize with, and integrity that is unquestionable. You cannot help but to empathize with the excellent narrative and put yourself in Leonard's shoes. But the card that Leonard has been dealt is such a dark echo of functional existence. No matter how bad you want clean cut answers, the bigger picture has too many holes, and the extent of the criminal deeds of every character in this film is suspect. We cannot help but to empathize with Leonard because we know just by his running narrative as we hear his thoughts that his sincerity and resoluteness is unshakeable, but it is never quite clear how far he has been willing to go see justice incurred. Memento doesn't leave us hanging, but the unanswered questions make for a beautifully dark movie that it pulls you into a sea of uncertain reality. It's not that often that you come across movies with a grip that is as alluring as it is spooky.
I have to mention that it is perfectly acted by Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne Moss. And Joe Pantoliano could not have been a better choice.
This is a movie that actually better on a second or third watch, because once you have drawn your conclusions, there are plenty of questions to play with, and the mood is so thick you can cut it with a knife!"
swordsnare,"Sep 17, 2020",9/10,Non-lineal storytelling at its best by Christopher Nolan. Watched this multiple times. Guy Pearce's best role also.
shoppermail-46066,"Jul 21, 2023",10/10,"Someone wrote Mind Blowing and that's just right. Didn't want to be a copycat so changed my title. I was only 14 when my sister rented this movie and we watched without permission. No wonder I didn't get it. Reluctantly (at first), I watched it again last week (now many years later). This is a true sychodrama. I have tried my hand at script writing and I know how hard it is to put something together that fits as tightly as this movie does. Everything is logical, there is no holes I could see. The acting is just right and the fact that they had matrix girl, Carrie Moss, made it all the more enjoyable the 2nd time around. If you want something cerebral, then look no further. Get your popcorn, sit back and enjoy this show (you may want a notepad if you really want to follow)."
Soumyadeep9190,"Aug 21, 2025",10/10,"Christopher Nolan's Memento is, without doubt, one of the greatest psychological thrillers ever made - and perhaps the most complicated and intelligent film of his career. This isn't just a story told on screen; it's an experience of memory, time, and truth itself.Guy Pearce delivers one of the finest performances of his life as Leonard Shelby. Despite being an underrated actor, here he proves that he could stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the best. His expressions, his narration, and his broken vulnerability make Leonard both tragic and terrifying at the same time.The brilliance of Memento lies in its storytelling structure - Nolan flips cinema on its head by placing us directly inside Leonard's fractured mind. We don't just watch a man with short-term memory loss; we live through it. Every black-and-white scene versus color sequence has a purpose, slowly pulling us toward the ultimate truth.The story of Sammy Jankis, the blurred memories of his wife, and the horrifying revelations at the end all combine to create a climax that is both devastating and genius. When the final twist hits, you can't help but whisper ""Wow"" in disbelief.This isn't just a thriller. It's cinema in its purest, most ambitious form. As Scorsese once said - Absolute Cinema."
marcotoru_,"May 14, 2020",10/10,"The movie is entirely new even if you see it today, Nolan proves his capacities in a movie that is so tense. You may think going backwards should spoil the movie or make it so difficult, hell nah! This story works perfectly, easy to follow and easy to understand if you don't get distracted."
masonsaul,"Jun 20, 2024",10/10,"Memento is a very smart thriller that's constantly shifting and piecing together all the answers with the film, at its own pace, makes you feel smart. It's definitely Christopher Nolan's darkest film with a bleak ending that eschews the hope that would permeate most of his later work for a world where neither people, pen & paper or memory can be trusted.Guy Pearce has a convincingly excessive level of kindness to over compensate for Leonard's inability to remember others which hides a real darkness, making him a lot less clear cut than he initially seems. Carrie-Anne Moss does terrific work with one of Nolan's better female characters and Joe Pantoliano plays to his strengths whilst getting to be more subtle.Christopher Nolan going from Following to this is insane. It's a huge leap in ambition and technical craft and he pulls it off flawlessly, restructuring an already twisty narrative in a way that's easy to follow and constantly transitions between colour and black & white with ease. Composer David Julyan crafts a fittingly repetitive score that's rife with tragedy.A weaker version of this could've been incoherent but Dody Dorns's editing ensures that never happens. Effect happens before cause here and it's constantly engaging to witness the film working its way backwards, showing big events out of context and then gradually revealing more information until it all clicks into place in immensely satisfying fashion."
TheTheatreKidFrom90s,"Jan 9, 2010",6/10,"You know that IMDb Top 250 is always discussed, the overrated movies, the underrated movies, the movies which should be in the list, the movies which should not be in the list etc. I believe that movies like Memento causes a problem. The ratings of some other movies lose their meaning. They cause some other movies lose their worth. Memento has one of the most smart, brilliant and complicated scripts of all time and also the story editing of the film is the same, it must be very hard to make, as known, the story begins from the end and retrogresses, in terms of direction, it is well, but no more than that, so a good movie, a good crime thriller. The tone of the movie is 'independentish'. I don't say this in a good way or in a bad way, but it just looked me interesting. Even if I could not understand it exactly, there is also a twist at the end. I recently saw The Machinist which I can call Christian Bale's Memento, it was a pretty good movie, but there were plot holes, but there is not in Memento, so I appreciate the effort, but it is neither one of my favorite movies nor a great movie. If its rating had been 7.7 or let's say 8.0, it would have been welcome. Probably it is because the script was brilliant, I agree, but as a movie, generally 8.6 is extremely over."
nscoby93,"Jul 27, 2022",10/10,"While Following was Nolan's directorial debut there's no doubt Memento put Nolan on the map.Memento is a such a great film and Christopher Nolan's storytelling and writing shines bright. With great performances from Guy Pearce, Carrie-Anne Moss, and Joe Pantoliano it makes this a memorable film.The way this story unfolds is truly unique. At a moment in the film I paused just to ask myself ""what is happening in this movie? I literally felt like I was figuring things out as Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) was. How Nolan puts the audience in scenes to experience them as Leonard was is genius. The films twist ending is satisfying and one that I did not see coming.I've seen this film like three times and I'm always left satisfied.

lagriff05,"Aug 26, 2009",7/10,"This is just...I don't even know. I watched this years ago and was really blown away by its odd structure, but really it's rather simple once you get a grip on it - heinously simple, even. It's told backwards in a linear line and interspersed with black and white shots of the lead actor telling us the back story, so what? This movie is given a lot of credit for being complex, but it's not that mind boggling when you think about it. And the ending just feels like a huge slap in the face, especially after all that build up and guessing...it's deceitful!And a lot of the first half of this is just too dull at times - especially the bits where the lead character is telling you about his client in the past who had a similar condition. It just feels too forced; they could have done it in a better and more interesting way.But I'd be lying if I said it wasn't a good movie anyway. The deceit of the ending has its purpose and everything is fulfilled in the end; I just can't help feeling a little odd about it anyway. The strength of this movie just lies in the suspense that comes with it. Deceitful or not, it keeps you watching and guessing until the end. Sigh, this is a really dividing movie, as you can tell. You just don't know what to think about it, and I guess that's another good thing about it. Memento is a perplexing case and I would recommend it if you like thrillers - although you could always do better, this one definitely stands out."
mcq3000,"Oct 15, 2002",N/A,"The plot is extremely straightforward when watched in sequence. The scenes are not in chronological order, but it is easy to piece it together. This movie is impressive in that it is really a case study about memories and how we shape our lives based on our memories. Some people take advantage of it, some use it to define who they are, while some totally disregard regard it and try to stick with the facts/written word. The  main character incorporates all these facets into his life at one point or the other, and the movie shows that no one facet defines who you truly are.What IS complicated in the movie is determining what is fact and what the main character thinks has happened or what he has conditioned himself to think occured in the past. Therein lies the complexity of the movie, and there are several clues thrown in throughout the movie, very subtle but indicative clues.The movie does require at least a second viewing to capture the points the director is trying to make."

AuteurCoded,"Nov 25, 2025",10/10,"Memento (2000)
Concept & Story (10/10)
A revolutionary concept that turns the thriller genre on its head. It perfectly externalizes the main character's condition (anterograde amnesia) by telling the story in reverse-chronological order. It's a deep, philosophical dive into identity, memory, and the self-deception required to find purpose.Direction & Acting (10/10)
Christopher Nolan's breakthrough masterpiece. The direction is meticulously precise, demanding absolute concentration from the audience, which brilliantly mirrors Leonard's own struggle. Guy Pearce's performance as Leonard Shelby is masterful, conveying confusion, paranoia, and a terrifying sense of lost resolve. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano are perfect foils, playing ambiguous characters who could be helpers or manipulators.Emotional Impact (9/10)
The impact is less about raw, heart-wrenching emotion (like Shawshank) and more about existential dread and intellectual disorientation. You feel Leonard's fragmented reality, which is deeply unsettling and leaves you shaken, especially after the final revelation.Aesthetic & Cinematography (9.5/10)
Wally Pfister's cinematography is essential to the structure. The stark, forward-moving black-and-white segments contrast brilliantly with the moody, reverse-moving color segments. The use of tattoos, Polaroids, and notes as visual memory aids is iconic and visually dynamic.Technical Execution (10/10)
Flawless. Dody Dorn's editing is arguably the most crucial technical element, seamlessly weaving the two timelines together so they converge at the perfect, devastating moment. The pacing is relentless, demanding full engagement from start to finish.Engagement & Rewatchability (10/10)
It demands multiple viewings. The first watch is a chaotic mystery; subsequent viewings allow you to appreciate the subtle clues, the foreshadowing, and the ingenious construction, shifting your focus from ""What happens next?"" to ""What happened before?""
Final Rating: 9.9/10
Memento is a landmark piece of filmmaking that redefined the possibilities of nonlinear narrative. It's a challenging, rewarding, and deeply unsettling film that forces the viewer to confront the unreliable nature of their own memory. A true classic of modern psychological cinema."
utzbfn,"Aug 25, 2022",10/10,"I first saw Memento 20 years ago, not long after its release, and watched it again last year. This film is a genuine experience when first viewed. It's the reason why I watch movies, hoping for experiences like this, but they are rare.Memento is unique because the story is revealed to viewers in reverse (backwards) order. The beginning of the movie shows the end of the story, then proceeds towards the beginning. This might not sound appealing but in fact it engages the viewer in the story - or more specifically. It puts you in the head of the lead character, who suffers from amnesia.And while you might wonder how there's suspense and intrigue in a story told backwards, you'll have to watch it yourself to see. In fact there's plenty there in terms of plot twists and surprise. It's a one of a kind and well worth your time. The casting and acting performances are spot on."

budmassey,"Sep 5, 2001",1/10,"After all this time, I am still not sure why I hate this movie so much. Perhaps it is because so much undeserved praise was heaped on this pretentious and presumptuous MTV video with aspirations to being a ""serious"" movie. It meanders, sometimes careens, from one gratuitous plot twist to the next, yet in reality very little actually happens. In the end, this is not a bad approach if we are going to get character development instead. Alas, none is here. The characters might as well have had their profiles tattooed on them, like the main character does, because they are no less obvious and devoid of subtlety.Memento confuses plot intricacy for story, of which there is precious little here. Granted the story had to be sparse to further the self-conscious conceit that ties up this formulaic and trite little package with a bow. Now don't get me wrong. Any film that causes us to reconsider what we think we know and to see things in ways to which we are not accustomed is great. But that must not be confused with clumsy subterfuges designed to suggest one thing and mean another. That's just plain silly and cheap, a mindless maze that wanders aimlessly until the author runs out of gas. That's what we have here.Guy Pearce, the Other Australian Actor, is good, reminding me at times of Brad Pitt before he demonstrated so convincingly time and again his epic lack of talent. Unlike Brad, though, Guy is talented. Perhaps too talented for such a claustrophobic little film. And what's up with Joe Pantoliano? Let's see, maybe we can give just him a sandwich board to carry around announcing his ulterior motive in every scene. He is the most typecast actor around, and he could phone in a performance with more mystery and finesse.Still without Guy and Joe, formidable talents in better vehicles, this film would be desolate. Oh, there's lots of little black and white vignettes, and the story is told backwards which has been universally acclaimed as genius, but which, at least for me, smacks of artifice and cliché.Look beyond the gimmickry, and you have a film that aches for a purpose, a theme, a message. What it has instead is a sort of Michael Mann vapidity that even throws in the car and the suit. Holy Don Johnson, Batman.I cannot begin to tell you how over-rated this movie is. It is a favorite of ersatz intellectuals who want to prove their smarts and congratulate themsevles by ""figuring out"" this empty, pointless wankfest of a monumentally overrated movie."

bob the moo,"Oct 29, 2001",N/A,"Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce) is hunting the man who killed his wife. He has to do this while struggling with short term memory loss meaning he relies on photos of important things and tattooing important facts on his body.As everyone in the world knows the film runs backwards from the end for the majority - meaning that we, like Leonard see events without any knowledge of what has gone before. Like him we only have photos etc to help us. Unlike him we know what will happen and this makes it easier to follow the story. The film follows two streams - one where Leonard is telling someone over the phone about Sammy Jankis - a man who has the same memory condition. The second stream is the main narrative backwards.This film is amazing. If the story was told forwards then there would be very little here but the devil is in the editing. This is a director's film - the key lies in the editing of scenes and the many visual tricks that provide clues to the conclusion of the film. The main compliant everyone has is that the ending leaves too many questions unanswered - however on the first viewing this is not true. The first time you see it the ending is simply and devastating - the twist is not as breath taking as Usual Suspects or Se7en but it will profoundly move you. When you get over this you begin to pick back over the plot and the ""Sammy Jankis"" section and you will find it difficult to come up with a water-tight solution. But to me that's one of the things to enjoy - the discussion with friends about the film and the fact that it stays with you for weeks after you've watched it.Pearce is excellent in the lead, I cannot believe this guy once was in Neighbours! He is a totally believable character and makes the audience feel so many different things throughout. Joe Pantoliano is excellent - but then he always is. Even Carrie Anne Moss is good. The strength of Moss and Pantoliano is that we don't know who they are - are they Leonard's friends, enemies, good, bad? - and they play on this ignorance wonderfully.The film is not in the top 250 because of the story but because of the editing. This is so different from anything else recently that it blows you away. It takes 15 minutes to get going but once you're in then you're in. This is worth watching as it shows how even a simple story can have a huge impact."
Cory Wilson,"Sep 4, 2001",6/10,"""Memento"" is told in reverse, which makes it hard to follow at times.  In normal chronological order this would be a normal run of the mill murder mystery.

Peaches-11,"Jan 31, 2002",9/10,"Quite simply this is one of the best films I've seen with actors and actresses of whom I've barely seen. This is NOT a cult film which is popular by some weird twist of fate. This IS a solid film; well acted, directed and definitely well written. Although I have seen this basic plot twice before, I haven't seen it in a movie or so well done. The combination of Leonard's brain damage and the reverse chronologic filming allow one of the most bizarre plot twists I've seen. Thespian for Thespian, one of the best-done films to come out of Hollywood."
eldenwang,"Jan 25, 2017",7/10,"This movie is great not because of wonderful stories but how they are told. I could not figure out what this movie is trying to say for the first time I watched it. However, I knew these stories were narrated from the end for the second time and could narrowly understand the whole structure. After watching many masterpieces of Christopher Nolan, I gradually developed a particular sense to know how the plots would go on because his technique is basically playing with clips. This movie tells a very simple story that the leading role's wife was 'murdered' somehow, and he tried his best to find and kill the 'murderer'. Monochrome scenes were narrated from the beginning while colorized ones from the end. Only at last could we know that it had always been him that created puzzles and solved them himself."

There was no way he should have been/could have been on the street driving [not knowing where he came from or probably why he was going to point B] let alone seriously be carrying a gun trying to fulfil a vengeance correctly. I'm lucky he didn't point the gun at me. A boring story told in forward so it had to be told sloppily and in reverse as a last ditch effort to be ""intellectually"" interesting. Save your time on this one. And ya, ya, don't bother to tell me about the nuances of it being told in reverse it was just lackluster film."

I watched the entire film with open eyes, even though it was very late. I loved the film. In fact, it's my favorite movie ever! So I asked my sister every day if I could see it again and now, I bought it from her. I watch it at least one time every week and it never gets boring. The story is great, the acting is superb and the whole backwards-thing really gives you the idea that you have short-term memory-loss yourself. I recommend it to everyone.

bradenmueller,"Feb 10, 2024",8/10,"Christopher Nolan's 'Memento' is a masterclass in non-linear storytelling, inviting viewers on a labyrinthine journey through the fragmented mind of Leonard Shelby, played with compelling intensity by Guy Pearce. The film's reverse chronological order is not just a gimmick but the very essence of its narrative structure. It mirrors Leonard's condition of anterograde amnesia, effectively immersing the audience in his disorienting quest for truth and vengeance.From a thematic standpoint, 'Memento' delves deeply into the concepts of memory, identity, and the subjective nature of truth. Nolan expertly weaves these themes into a tight script that challenges the viewer to piece together the puzzle along with Leonard. The film prompts introspection about the reliability of our own memories and how they shape our sense of self.Technically, 'Memento' is a triumph. The cinematography by Wally Pfister is stark and gritty, complementing the film's tone. The editing is particularly noteworthy, as it seamlessly intertwines the color and black-and-white sequences, enhancing the narrative's disorienting effect. The score by David Julyan subtly underscores the film's moody atmosphere.On a personal note, 'Memento' struck a chord with its portrayal of a man desperately trying to make sense of a world that slips away from him every few minutes. It's a film that stays with you, not just for its innovative storytelling, but for the emotional resonance of a character striving to find a foothold in an ever-shifting reality.In conclusion, 'Memento' is a brilliant exercise in unconventional storytelling. It may not cater to all tastes, given its complex structure, but for those who appreciate cinema that challenges and engages, it's a deeply rewarding experience. The film not only entertains but also invites viewers to ponder the fragility of memory and the constructs of our own identities. Nolan's work here is not just a narrative twist but a profound exploration of the human psyche."
Infofreak,"Mar 25, 2003",N/A,"Every few years a movie comes along that internet nerd fanboys and hardened movie buffs alike agree is something special. 'Memento' is one of those movies. The first time I watched it in a cinema I was blown away. Subsequent viewings (I'm probably up to my fourth) take a little bit of the shine off it and the essential gimmickiness of it become more obvious. It also becomes apparent that Shelby's memory disorder is a bit too contrived and only seems to kick in (or not) at the most dramatically convenient moments. Some closer scrutiny will see the whole thing quickly fall apart. Still, there's no real point in being too picky with this movie. If you accept the premise at face value you are guaranteed a fascinating and involving film experience. Australian soap actor Guy Pearce ('Ravenous') is brilliant as Shelby, easily the best role of his career to date. The ""backwards"" story telling of the movie (nicked most likely off Harold Pinter) was much talked about but it is Pearce's performance which really sells it. Joe Pantoliano ('The Sopranos') has too often been stuck in b-grade movies, so it's really good to see him given a more rewarding part. He seems to relish it and his chemistry with Pearce is really enjoyable. Likewise with Pantoliano's co-star in 'The Matrix' Carrie-Ann Moss. Moss can really act, and I hope this leads on to some substantial work for her in the future.  The underrated character actor Steven Tobolowsky ('Thelma And Louise') is also excellent in the important supporting role of Sammy Jankis, and a couple of actors I really like Mark Boone, Jr ('Trees Lounge') and Callum Keith Rennie ('Hard Core Logo') are both worth keeping an eye out for along the way. The hype surrounding 'Memento' may put many people off, but that would be a real shame as it just about lives up to it, and it's a very, very good movie. Highly recommended."
zackl-60078,"May 6, 2024",10/10,"Memento is a film that a follows a man named Leonard who lost his memory from trying to kill his wife's murderers. This film is kind of confusing because it starts with ending and ends with a beginning, but I love it! The way this film's scenes are laid out is probably one of my favorite ways a movie is made, kinda like how Pulp Fiction is. I think this movie doesn't get as much recognition on social media as other Nolan's films do, which sucks because it's a masterpiece in my opinion. I just love the writing from this film, and the performance by Guy Pearce makes it even better. Christopher Nolan is probably one of my favorite writer-directors from this generation. Loved this film!"
alibrahim1,"Mar 2, 2024",7/10,"I have to tell my opinion about Memento in two ways, cinematically and my own personal preference.Cinematically, this is a work of art by Christopher Nolan. The way the movie is structured is very unique. You watch the movie in the perspective of the protagonist, and how he is viewing his life. I felt anxious, tense and confused with him. I felt manipulated, really wanted him to cure his condition so he can realize all he is going through! I was sad about him, wanting him to get revenge, yet i know something is not right which makes me as a viewer very anxious. Not from not knowing what going to happen, but generally from the idea that ""his memory is very short"" People lied to him, manipulated and used him to their own benefit, he looked naive and weak because of his memory loss yet very smart... He is so devastated that in the end even though for a minute he acknowledged that he might have really got revenge and something was wrong, yet he was willing to follow false clues and continue down this path of him seeking for revenge. The never ending loop he is in.The idea of the story is very simple, yet Nolan and his brother portrayed it in a unique way .However, Personally, I don't like to watch a movie where i'm confused and the plot is all over the place. That's just my point of view and preference. Doesn't mean I didn't enjoy the movie. I like straightforward movies. This is far from it. You're all around the place, present, future, past. All while i'm trying to process and understand the story.Not my thing but Great movie!! Amazing style by Nolan."
rauh-georg,"Sep 28, 2008",3/10,"It eludes me how this movie has gotten such high ratings and even two Oscar nominations.This movie is for the most part mind-boggling boring, with endless repetitive sequences of how our main character writes notes, tries to remember certain events or persons. This goes on for about 80% of the movie in an desperate attempt to create ""suspense""...but it gets tiresome. The end admittedly had a moderate surprising twist...however, from a certain point of view, the end was also predictable and, somehow, disappointing. The only positive thing about the movie is a good performance by Carrie Ann Moss, however the main character did not convince me, neither did the plot. (If there was one, besides of a repetitive line-up of the character's confusion and attempts by him to puzzle together memories.) This movie is breathtakingly boring and the ending *extremely* underwhelming. One of the movies which is praised about all over, you watch it - and it turns out a huge disappointment."
blanceto,"Apr 5, 2021",10/10,"Even after the crazy 20 years, fast-pacing movie industry, thousands of new movies comes after, but there's nothing as akin to this.Memento is such a clever, intelligent, confusing, mind provoking movies that went beyond expectation. It doesn't need a grandeur CGI or costive settings. It's good for the way it is. With a good story-line that makes you immersed into every single details on this movie. The non-linear style this movie has put you in Leonard Shelby's shoes, to feel his perplexity, anguish, anger and desperation for living with short-term memory loss.It's a great and beautiful movie that you can't watch it for only once. It attracts you to keep watching it even after years passed. And it's never come close to disappoint you every time you watch it. Only it make things even clearer and you'll understand more about what the story was about.I can't stop telling everyone that they can't pass through this. They need to know and I want to discuss things with them. So, it's a highly recommend movie for those who just simply curious or wants to see one of the best Nolan's works of all time. Watch it carefully and capture every details so you'll understand it lot better than only watching it casually."
Sammy2006,"Aug 4, 2004",N/A,"Alright, I may not be an expert but my knowledge of this movie surpasses that of the common viewer.First off i recommend you all, if you haven't already, read the short story it was based on titled ""Memento Mori"" written by Christopher's brother Jonathon Nolan.Now for starters i do not believe that Lenny has the ""condition."" I believe that it is mental not physical. My reasoning behind this is that there were many instances where he DID remember things. Throughout the whole movie he would catch glances of his tattoos and have no idea what they were, he would roll up his sleeve, or take off his shirt to investigate, but as he was taking down Teddy's license plate number not only did he remember that he normally gets tattoos but he also remembered what number fact he was on. ALso in the same instance he writes down the 1 and the i exactly the same way, he gets it tattooed exactly the same way, but whenever he read it out loud he differentiated between the two. How could he do this without memory?Most of the movie will drive you insane to try to figure out, i speak from experience, but the director himself said that there was a logical explanation, unfortunately i don't think we can ever be sure whether we are right or not.This is my all time favorite movie, so if you have not seen it please do."
bevo-13678,"Oct 6, 2020",10/10,I like the bit where a man with short-term memory loss attempts to track down his wife's murderer.
hitchcockthelegend,"Jul 12, 2015",9/10,"It's not until a film like Memento comes along, or that you personally have to deal with someone close who suffers a form of this subject to hand, that you get jolted to remember just how your memory is such a prized and treasured thing - and crucially that it's one of your key safety devices.Christopher and Jonathan Nolan crafted one of the best films of 2000 based on those facets of the human condition. Their protagonist is Leonard Shelby, played with stupendous believability by Guy Pearce, who is suffering from a memory amnesia caused by a trauma to the head as he tried to aide his wife who was raped and murdered. He can remember things before the incident, but anything post that and he can't form a memory. So who can he trust? Does he know any of the few people who appear to be in his life at the present time? He tattoos his body to help him remember, constantly writes notes to keep him alert in his now alien world, while all the time he is on the search for the man who ruined his life.Christopher Nolan plants the audience right into Leonard's world. By using a reverse story telling structure it's deliberately complex and ingenious given that it opens with the ending! It has been argued that it's trickery for trickery sake, style over substance, but the way each scene is built upon in the narrative is a thing of high quality, it's all relevant and demands the closest of attention from the viewer, where cheekily we are ourselves asked to form memories of prior narrative passages. Mystery is strong throughout, the characters currently in Leonard's life may have different means and motives, it keeps us alert, with the confusion, lies, manipulations, enigmas and amnesia angles booming with neo-noir vibrancy. And the Nolan's know their noir of course, adding a narrator who is hard to define or trust himself!The reverse structure wasn't new in 2000, but Christopher Nolan picks up the idea and adds new strands to it, simultaneously bringing his visual ticks as David Julyan's musical score shifts from elegiac forebodings to pulse pounding dread, and as evidenced by the darling easter egg option that allows one to watch it in chronological order, it's a damn fine thriller without the reverse trickery anyway. Super. 9/10"
grantss,"Jan 31, 2016",10/10,"Mind-bogglingly, breath-takingly brilliant - insanely original and intelligent.A man, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce) has just shot and killed another man. Why did he do it? Through scenes shown in reverse order (with individual scenes separated by another set of scenes shown in forward order), we unravel the mystery.Christopher Nolan's second movie. His first, Following, was great and showed his penchant for clever, original plots. Here he exceeded himself - Memento is probably the cleverest, most original movie you'll ever see.The reverse order thing is a brilliant concept in itself, and as far as I know the only other movie to try it was Irreversible by Gaspar Noe (released after Memento, so Memento did it first). Irreversible was much more simple in its method - just play the scenes in reverse order.However, with Memento, Nolan goes one step further. By having intermittent forward-moving scenes he helps add backstory. These eventually meet the backward-moving scenes, closing the continuity loop and making for a seamless, continuous story.Furthermore, it is not the reverse order of the scenes alone that make this movie brilliant. Reverse order scenes without a solid plot behind them would just be a gimmick, and this is certainly no gimmicky movie. The plot itself is brilliant, and ultimately explains why we have to see the scenes backwards.Moreover, despite the enormous complexity of writing and staging such a concept, in the end everything fits and makes sense. Nolan also leaves just enough ambiguity and mystery behind so you can fill in your own theories and backstories.This movie deserves every superlative a movie can get."
Arthur_At_IMDb,"Apr 18, 2022",10/10,"I really like Memento, it's my favorite Nolan's movie. And even thought this is the second movie of his career, it's possible to notice his marks. Short scenes, quick dialogues (but all of them important for the story) and a big plot-twist (or many of them).The movie is about Leonard, and he is looking for the man who killed his wife. But there's a problem. On the night of the murder, he had an accident and now he can't make new memoirs. Because of it, he uses notes and tattoos to remember the clues. There are also people he thinks he can trust to get information, but these actually take advantage of his condition.It's a big puzzle and you keep your attention on the screen to try to put the pieces together and solve it. One thing that force you to pay attention is the movie's structure. The plot happens like ""from back to front"" (I personally only realized this some time after the movie had started), what makes you anxious for the next scene and anxious for the next scene of the next scene.In parallel with the main plot, there's flashbacks (in chronological order) in black and white in the transition of scenes that contributes to the viewer's understanding of some aspects of the story.At first, the editing of this film seems to be confusing and unnecessary, but throughout the movie you understand the reason why of this and when you finish to watch it you notice it could not be made in another way.When you least expect it, you are not only trying to connect the informations, but also thinking about who to really trust and what Leonard really is looking for.Everything is relevant in this movie and you must be attentive to details. I like it."
Kuba_D,"Apr 13, 2007",6/10,"End the from begins that thriller dark a. If you have problems with understanding the previous sentence, you are going to have even more trouble with understanding the film. Its basic idea is turning the action around. Not in a mechanical way, fortunately. ""Memento"" is a pack of scenes that end in the moment the previous scenes started in.The main character is an ex-detective from an insurance company (Guy Pearce). His wife, as everything seems so, has been brutally raped and murdered while he himself was hit in his head. The effect of damage is the so-called short memory loss. Our hero remembers exactly who he was before that tragical incident, but he doesn't remember who he talked to and what about five minutes ago. That is why he has to write everything down. He collects Polaroid pictures of the people he meets. He fills his pockets with some quick notes. He even treats his own body as a big organizer and he tattoos his chest with the main memorized clue: ""John G. murdered your wife"".This film has its own style and class. The idea itself about a guy who doesn't remember his experiences from a second ago is great. The ""reverse gear"" narration used here seems to be both logical and functional solution. Sometimes it is quite funny. For example, when the character doesn't know whether he chases someone or he is being chased."
powell-yendi,"Mar 13, 2014",7/10,"This movie is like a beautiful person, who everyone agrees is beautiful, but only some would date. It is a matter of taste. I loved the action, mystery, and drama in this film. I loved the original plot and phenomenal acting. But I don't like movies that lack a protagonist. I don't like movies about bad people doing bad things for the rest of their lives. I like to see at least one good person, who does the right thing, and achieves justice in some form at the end. What ever happened to the universal theme of good vs. evil? Do Americans just want to see evil? Is there an evil trend going on that I wasn't informed of? This movie would have gotten a 10 if it had a happy ending, or even a happy anything. Movies that start and end with wickedness are not my thing."

tburke85,"Jun 8, 2009",8/10,"Memento was a much better film than anticipated from acclaimed writer/director Christopher Nolan the man behind films like The Prestige, Insomnia, Batman Begins, and last years blockbuster hit The Dark Knight which was my favorite movie of 2008. In Memento Nolan really establishes himself as an extremely talented filmmaker. Memento has an intricate but not too complicated story and the way the movie plays out with the ending in the beginning and the beginning at the end makes it feel different (in a good way) and original. Its one of those films to watch a couple times to fully understand what it was all about and so that you can pick up on little things you didn't notice the first time around. The surprises in store for anyone who hasn't seen it I wasn't quite expecting myself which made the film very enjoyable to watch at least to me. The three leads in the movie are admirable in their roles including Guy Pearce as Leonard a man with a rare brain disorder after an accident who can't form new memories. Pearce's Leonard is after the one who raped and killed his wife a man's identity he can never know for sure. Pearce is believable in the role and does a great job as the main character. Carrie Anne-Moss does a decent job as Natalie an ally to Leonard who helps in his quest to find his wife's killer but may not be who she appears. Moss is quite good at playing a character you're not sure is trying to help Leonard or just using him. The same can go for Joe Pantoliano whose equally impressive as Teddy a man Leonard isn't sure whether he can fully trust. The rest of the relatively unknown cast also turn in solid performances. The ending is fitting which reveals some secrets while keeping other questions unanswered but that doesn't hurt the movie. Overall Memento was much better than expected because of it's interesting revenge story, complex characters played by talented actors, and surprising plot twists that make for an above average entertaining thriller to watch."
Raed_911,"Mar 18, 2013",8/10,"This is my 1st review on the site and I have chosen this masterpiece of a movie to review.I have seen movies in my life with an innovation factor whether its the characters, the plot, the directing or even the soundtrack, but this movie deserves to be a great, clear contender in the innovation land.Since the 80s, we are tired as viewers of clichés regarding protagonists or antagonists and this movie serves the cause of surprising the viewer not necessarily plot-wise, but character-wise. I mean all of the characters in this movie have their ups and downs within the build up.Guy Pearce is certainly one of my favorite actors of all time, so it isn't new to me that I got owned by his acting and for Carrie-Anne Moss, she is an actress of natural, God-given ability. So, where did the pleasant surprise came from?... It came from Joe Pantoliano who added THE flavor to the movie.If you still haven't watched this movie and I doubt it, then go and see it today for it is a masterpiece not necessarily in its epic, rich, novely aspect, but for its innovation."
MrBoMzIMDb,"Sep 7, 2025",7/10,"Christopher Nolan's Memento was widely celebrated upon release for its audacious narrative structure, exploring memory, identity, and revenge in a non-linear format. The film follows Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), a man suffering from anterograde amnesia, as he painstakingly pieces together clues to find his wife's murderer. Told largely in reverse chronological order, the film immerses viewers in Leonard's disoriented perspective, creating a puzzle-like experience that demands active engagement.Guy Pearce delivers a captivating performance, portraying Leonard's obsessive determination and emotional fragility with subtlety. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano provide strong supporting roles, adding layers of moral ambiguity and manipulation that heighten the tension. While these performances are compelling, the characters often feel secondary to the narrative mechanics, which take precedence.Visually, the film is minimalist yet effective, using tight framing, muted color palettes, and noir-inspired cinematography to mirror Leonard's fragmented memory. Nolan's direction and the reverse editing style were groundbreaking at the time, but for contemporary audiences, especially younger viewers, the novelty may feel diminished. The emphasis on structure over character development can make the film feel emotionally distant and less impactful than its reputation suggests.Thematically, Memento examines perception, truth, obsession, and the unreliability of memory, offering intellectual stimulation over emotional resonance. While still innovative, modern viewers may find it overrated, as its narrative cleverness does not fully translate into lasting emotional engagement.In conclusion, Memento remains an intellectually intriguing thriller, but contemporary audiences may find it less compelling than the hype it garnered.Rating: 7/10 - Stylish and clever, yet somewhat overrated and emotionally distant for today's viewers."
ebiros2,"Sep 9, 2011",1/10,"The story changes track every 5 minutes, and is a torture to watch. I can appreciate if short term continuity is not an issue to come up with novel plot that you want to cram into one movie as much as possible, the whole movie would turn into something like - this !But honestly, you have to ask yourself, are the characters in this movie worth that much attention ? To me, they weren't. There're nothing likable about any of the characters that spurred me to find out the ""truth"" about their situations. So overall, it became like who cares after about the first 20 minutes, and no, I don't want to see this movie three or four times just to understand what's going on.So the movie is just a novelty, and I doubt that it will be remembered as any kind of a ground breaking masterpiece even if the ratings are high. How many people can honestly say that they went to see this movie four or five times at a theater ? I bet none. If I paid $10, I expect to be entertained in the first viewing, not shown some self indulgence of the screen writer that I have to sift through the mess to understand what's going on. You work for us, not the other way around.Please take it back, and you can keep it."
UniqueParticle,"Apr 15, 2020",10/10,"Guy Pearce is spelling binding! A bizarre story about memory, solving things, meticulous routine, and mysterious characters. Christopher Nolan is a masterful writer/director of any project; I'm quite shocked Memento didn't win the 2 Oscar nominations. I love any film that leaves you still thinking of it later on! Powerful puzzler of well constructed glorious captivating nature, glad to own Memento. I can't imagine what it'd be like to have long term memory loss only consisting to each day and remembering the smaller stuff."
timelord-3,"Apr 4, 2001",10/10,"I haven't seen a film for a long time that has kept my attention so absolutely as Memento did.  It is a superbly crafted film-noir thriller that is rivetting from beginning to end.  Or should that be from end to beginning?You see, that is what makes Memento so interesting.  It is told backwards. Guy Pearce plays a guy who suffers from short term memory loss - he can't form any lasting new memories ever since his wife was raped and killed by the mysterious Jimmy G.He keeps his life stable by writing notes on polaroids so he knows where he is staying, notes on the crime are kept in a rubber bound foldre provided by a contact within the police department.He is looking for the guy that killed his wife, Jimmy G.The structure of Memento is clever in that we share the amnesiacs fate throughout the course of the film - we see the results of actions and are as bemused as he is - it is only later we see the cause.Guy Pearce puts in a stellar performance as the afflicted avenger.  He is totally convincing and fully immersed in his role.He is ably supported by Joe Pantoliano and Carrie-Anne Moss who may or may not be what they seem - are they using him to their own ends or not?Get out and see it.  A film guaranteed to please if there ever was one. It'll have you talking post-movie with your mates in such a way you haven't experienced since seeing The Usual Suspects."
gavin6942,"Apr 20, 2014",9/10,"A man (Guy Pearce), suffering from short-term memory loss, uses notes and tattoos to hunt for the man he thinks killed his wife.Although Christopher Nolan had previously made ""Following"" and a short film, this was easily the film that catapulted him to worldwide success, landed him the Batman franchise, and made him one of the greatest directors working today. Although it may not be a fair assessment, the fact almost every one of his films has been in the Top 100 on IMDb suggests he has a magic touch not seen since the days of Kubrick or Hitchcock.This was also a great role for Pearce. He has been known for ""The Time Machine"", ""LA Confidential"", and more recently ""Iron Man 3"", but I think he will always be remembered for ""Memento"". He was, after all, the driving force behind the film in the acting department, appearing in basically every scene and conveying a wide range of emotions... the fact Pearce is not one of the highest-paid actors in the world is a bit unfortunate, because he can hold his own with the likes of Christian Bale and Daniel Day-Lewis."
=G=,"Sep 4, 2001",8/10,"""Memento"" is a little, minimalistic drama, artistically and technically well done film, which has received accolades from all corners well beyond both budget and hype. A ""whodunit"" of sorts with a curious premises, the film tells of an insurance investigator (Pearce) who suffers midterm memory loss and can't remember anything for more than 15 minutes. Pearce sets about find the killer of his wife, a difficult task for a normal investigator much less one with his ""condition"". The film's story is simple, the characters few, and there's no sex and little action or emoting going on. Rather the film focuses on the investigation with a clever one step forward, two steps backward flow and tortuous denouement which camouflages the many holes in the plot making for a compelling watch. Recommended for all adults into whodunits who want something to mentally chew on."
CinemaSerf,"May 30, 2024",7/10,"I reckon what makes this work from Christopher Nolan is the creation of a cerebral maelstrom that is every bit as confusingly frustrating for us watching as it is for his protagonist ""Leonard"" (Guy Pearce). Now we don't know how he has developed his menacing ninja skills, but we do know that he is trying to get to the bottom of his wife's murder, and that he has virtually no short-term memory to help him. As he pieces things together, he has to leave himself notes, or polaroids augmented with scribbles so he can recall just how far he has got and whom he can (or cannot) trust. The facts that he considers crucial are tattooed across his body as his search narrows - or does it? Along the way he meets some characters that he has some documentation on - some, not. Some he advises himself to trust, some not. Some of the photos depict dead bodies. On those fronts, we do have just a little more information on the cause tan he does - but it doesn't really help anyone deduce who did kill his wife? Maybe he did it himself? Its a maze of a film this. It's littered with twists and complications - but they are not annoying nor gratuitous. It's the ultimate in cinematic one step forward two steps back, and those muddled scenarios are only emphasised by ""Natalie"" (Carrie-Anne Moss) and an on-form Joe Pantoliano as ""Teddy"" - a man who features increasingly as his quest proceeds. I also did enjoy the ending. It avoids the concrete and the simplistic, and offers a fitting end to a potently effective effort from a Pearce at the top of his game."
zetes,"Nov 25, 2001",9/10,"I had grave doubts going into this one. Its fans seemed to me to be the same people who like a lot of the movies I really hated over the past five years or so, movies like The Matrix, Run Lola Run, Fight Club, and many others. I avoided it for a long time, though I always thought I had to see it no matter what. And when the chance to see it for free came along, I jumped at it.Fortunately, Memento lives up to the hype. It's one of the few movies that can. Seriously, I wouldn't doubt that this movie will one day be counted as one of the best ever made. Perhaps not the ninth best ever, its current position on the imdb top 250, but it will certainly have its place in the history books.The main reason for this is its unique narrative structure. Add this one to the ranks of Citizen Kane for its high level of narrative innovation. What it does is it tells its story backwards. It will give us one large chunk of narrative information, stop, and then rewind to the last place Leonard (Guy Pearce) began his small chunk of memory. You see, Leonard has this condition where he has little short-term memory. After a few minutes, he forgets everything that has happened to him since a serious injury. He reminds himself of his purpose every time he wakes up in a new chunk of memory through hosts of photos and notes that he has written to himself. His purpose: to avenge his dead wife. She was raped, and her rapist knocked poor Lenny on his head. This condition, which is the foundation of the narrative structure, is clearly false. You just have to suspend your disbelief as you watch, and, I promise you, you'll see something very unique.The best thing about this film is that it gives you some real mental exercise. It asks you to remember a large amount of information. Add to that the fact that not everything is trustworthy, and that truth and memory and facts and everything that we take for granted are constantly being questioned and warped, and you've got yourself an enjoyable uphill battle.The rest of the film is equally commendable, which ought to be remembered as long as you can retain it. The acting is quite good, especially Joe Pantoliano, so good in Bound, and Carrie-Anne Moss, with whom I was quite unimpressed in The Matrix. Here, she shows that she can play a complex character and that her main assets aren't her T&A. Guy Pearce is also quite good, though he was perhaps better in L.A. Confidential. I think someone else might have brought a bit more depth to the part, but perhaps not. One of the most difficult things about his role is the fact that he really has no complexities - he's a blank slate. One could honestly call him simply a tool of the plot. However, someone who would say that would be missing the fact that he is often being used as a tool by other characters. Christopher Nolan is not just a master scenarist, he's also an excellent director. Also great is the cinematography, sharp color with some spatterings of black and white.Perhaps there are some plot holes, but I didn't notice them. This is truly a masterpiece, a film to remember. 10/10."
SPZMaxinema,"Oct 17, 2021",6/10,"Aside from Guy Pearce and Carrie Anne-Moss's performances, and of course Christopher Nolan's overall talent as a director, I could not get invested in this film. I get that it is the kind of movie that many can be fascinated by given how it's structured with its themes and many of the plot elements, but the reversed plot and jumbled sequences were the same things that took me out of the film! Plus I really didn't care about the main character enough to be entirely emotionally invested in him and his arch. It loses me at quite a few spots and is so convoluted with multiple focal points that it ruined any chance of me truly enjoying it, even though I wanted to."
jfm424,"Jan 31, 2003",1/10,"Rated 10th best overall by IMDB? There was nothing above average in this movie. A weak plot that unfolds backwards is worse, not fresh, creative, or ground-breaking. If you ranked this movie in your top 10  you probably enjoyed such classics as Lost Highway and Drowning Mona.If you can appreciate an art display consisting of a cage of live chickens running around, this movie is for you.

doryhobbs,"Sep 4, 2007",10/10,"I cannot believe when I see the other bad reviews of this movie. Once again, I think that the plot goes over peoples' heads and they do not realize what is going on.

Guy Pearce is unbelievable and this was the first time I saw what an incredible actor he is. Also, Carrie Anne Moss is ubelievabley gorgeous and Joe Pantoliano (also another favorite) is hilarioius and inscrutable. I can watch this movie time and again and never get tired of it.

preppy-3,"Mar 28, 2001",8/10,"A man (Guy Pearce) searches for the man who raped and killed his wife.  One problem--he has no long-term memory and forgets things a few minutes after he hears them.  Another thing--the whole story is shown backwards so you have to pay strict attention to what's going on.  It's difficult (most movies don't want you to think) and exhausting but absolutely fascinating. The acting is simply superb, direction assured and the story full of unexpected twists and turns.  Also there were revelations at the end (or beginning) that totally caught me by surprise.  It's not a perfect film--I still can't figure out what Moss' character was doing in this--but how many films can you name that challenge you and don't treat you like an idiot. This will probably be a bomb (it's way too difficult for an average audience), but if you like something different and intelligent this is definetely a film to see!"
eli-ass,"Mar 17, 2010",10/10,"--- more detailed review coming soon ---This is one of my favorite movies.Well what can I say about it ... It's fresh, original and highly intelligent. Christopher Nolan (who has not made any bad movie so far) also wrote the screenplay for this with his brother Jonathan and the way he directed it and put the scenes together is what makes this film work so well... There are some people reviewing this film as ""manipulation of the audience"" and that the style of storytelling is all just a gimmick ... That's simply not true! It is NOT just a gimmick! The way it is directed is not to confuse us (though it obviously does) but it just makes really! much! sense! concerning the plot and the main characters situation. In this way we really getting into the same trouble that Guy Pearce is going through. This will also be the reason for everyone to watch this movie at least twice. It will blow you away the first time, will reveal itself at a second viewing (well most of it) and will still be enjoyable for another run. I have to underline again I've probably never seen a movie as clever and intriguing as this one.Besides that we have great performances by all actors especially Guy Pearce who is really likable throughout with a slightly dry humour ...And the best thing is that the movie - once you got the mind challenge done and puzzled most of it together - still leaves room for interpretation! It's a real pleasure to discuss this movie.It's NOT a movie for popcorn or a Friday night with lots of friends and alcohol :) ...It's a movie for smart people that you must pay highest attention to cause if you miss anything you'll be completely lost!So go rent it right now and have fun!10/10"
sinefilcinephile,"Feb 17, 2021",10/10,"There are a few movies that I watch countlessly like addicted. Eternal Sunshine, 21 Grams, Back to the Future, 500 Days of Summer, and this movie. I remember the first time I watched the movie, I was so jealous of Leonard, who keeps forgetting the past and always lives the present. I enjoyed fifteen minutes periods as it made the audience feel empathy for Leonard. Like him, we had short term memory loss, trying to figure out the plot. One of the best movies there is."
MovieAddict2016,"Sep 1, 2002",10/10,"Though it's not the best film ever, 'Memento' is definitely on my top 250. It's one of the most original films ever, and the screenplay is excellent. It kept me guessing to the end, and the acting was brilliant by Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano. I highly recommend 'Memento' to you, I think it was my favorite film of 2001. 4.5/5 stars!JOHN ULMER"
Snoopy1,"Nov 30, 2002",N/A,"The movie wasn't bad.  It kept me entertained for the duration.  I didn't doze off.  But it was far too trendy in the way that it tried too hard to be artsy fartsy.  And I can't believe how many people are in awe of the who backwards thing...it's not like it was unique to this movie.  Hell, ""Seinfeld"" even did it before them.  It began to get tedious to watch after a while and towards the end I was glancing at my watch every two minutes. While I'm glad I watched it, I probably won't watch it again.  And let us hope some people come to their senses and give a bunch of tens to the likes of ""Annie Hall"" and ""North By Northwest"" to push this movie down on the top 250.  Puh-leeze?"
djbeardpaperclip,"Aug 23, 2025",6/10,"This film is innovative in the way that the story is pieced together in reverse chronological order .The cinematography is excellent with selective use of black and white. There are multiple twists which can be difficult to follow. Most of the characters take advantage of the mental disability of the main character and exploit him for their own purposes. The viewer really has to pay attention, right from the first frame. Even now, I'm not sure that I got it all.All the actors are good. Guy Pierce was excellent. I'm pleased that it wasn't just yet another Brad Pitt movie as originally planned. Carrie-Ann Moss and Joe Pantoliano are terrific too."

harleyneiditz,"Mar 15, 2017",7/10,"Memento concerns Leonard Shelby, (a great performance by Guy Pearce) a man who suffers from short term memory loss. This leaves him unable to form new memories. Director Christopher Nolan puts us inside the mind of Leonard by giving the film a non-linear structure. This brilliant choice is at times a double edged sword. The non- linear time-line makes the viewer as clueless as Leonard Shelby. We don't know what has happened, when it happened, etc. I give Nolan chops for making that choice. I think it gives Memento its unique quality. On the other hand, the jumping back and forth does not allow Leonard Shelby to develop as a character. As I think more about this, it is actually brilliant. As a character who cannot form new memories, there is no reason for Leonard to have a character arc. The audience member is deprived of the same things as Leonard: closure, understanding, relief. This is definitely a film to see more than once. I bet that I will appreciate it more after viewing it another time. Meanwhile, watch, enjoy, and go along for the ride. Let Christopher Nolan play with your mind like silly putty."
hardyholz,"Sep 14, 2001",1/10,"I had heard all the raves. A reviewer said ""you'll want to watch this movie several times because it's so complex"". I really wanted to see it... Then I did. My wife gave up after less than half of it. I forced myself to see it through, because I hoped there was something to redeem it. Well, there wasn't. Complex? Nothing worthwile is revealed after the first half, actually, the thing is pretty much clear after the first scene - never mind the sordid detail revealed later, doen't add anything for me. An uninteresting, unbelievable, unappealing story acted out by characters one cannot get oneself to care for. So it's told backwards, big deal. I've seen similar things before, done much better. No short term memory? Try ""Winter Sleepers"", that idea is used there much better. Acting? The characters had to look bewildered and smarmy, in turns. Not a great range, in my opinion. My conclusions: don't bother with this one!"
sc4ever,"Aug 8, 2002",8/10,"WOW!!Wel i have seen this film twice and the first time i watched it i thought 'very clever, but whet the hell is the truth?!'I watched it the second time VERY closely and after a while of thinking my and my friend thought we had worked it all out!But now i'm not sure, after reading some of the reviews for this i'm not sure if what I thought is really what happened, so i'm left thinking i need 2 c it again!When i first watched it i was intrigued from the word go! i couldnt stop watching it and my eyes were glued to the T.V. I couldnt wait to find out what happened next (or before depending on how u look at it!!) It is a very clever storyline and i enjoyed it but u definatly cant relax while watching it, its almost as thought u need a pad of paper to write down everything that happened! which is just what lenard needs to do with his condition, which i suppose is the whole point to the movie to make u feel like u r him!But i am still confused on to what actually happened and i would love to ask the writers, directers etc what is the truth and what is the audience meant to think!! Is there a right answer ?? I dont know, but i determind to work out the truth so i need watch it again!I think it was a brilliant film because of how it was edited and it has such an different storyline and it is very weird but interesting to watch a film 'backwards' from the truth!I'm sum what confused but it is good :)If someone knows wot the actual truth is please please write a comment on here for me 2 read so i can compare what other people think happened to what i think! thanx!Definatly worth seeing but buy the video dont rent it because you will definatly need to watch it more than once! The first time u dont have a clue, ur just thinking 'wow thats clever but i dont get it'!!SEE IT ! ITS WORTH IT !"
paidinfull13,"Feb 13, 2018",8/10,"It is very tempting, and it is also fair, to compare Memento with Nolan's Prestige. Both require multiple viewing to fully grasp and enjoy the scenes.18 years later, Memento still puzzles. And when you finally think that you've understood it, the truth makes you shiver. Yes, this movie will make you discuss and argue its meaning.While I believe it could have been better in terms of sequencing, when I look at the progress that Mr. Nolan has made following this film, I can only applaud at his bold approach to Memento as stepping stone.
Bravo."
ronakkotian,"Oct 4, 2020",10/10,"Christopher Nolan has made some incredible films in his career, my two favourites being The Dark Knight and Inception. Now, Memento has joined that league.Memento follows Leonard, a man with short-term memory loss, who attempts to find his wife's killer.It's best going into Memento without knowing much about the plot and that's why I've refrained from revealing anything else in my brief summary. This is all I knew before watching and so I'm going to do the same with everyone else. Just knowing this brief plot summary made the experience of watching this film SO MUCH FUN! Seriously, this film took me completely by surprise.What Nolan was able to do with a story like Memento is incredibly clever. The whole narrative structure of this film is what most people will discuss. The film unravels the story in two ways. The colourized scenes play in reverse chronological order and the black and white scenes play the story in forward chronological order. The thing is, this could be done with many movies but it has the MOST purpose in Memento. Knowing that the protagonist suffers from short term memory loss, telling this story through this direction puts us in the shoes of Leonard as we're trying to figure out what happened before. To make a film like this isn't easy but Nolan's excellent screenplay keeps us engaged throughout. Nolan leaves us with many questions as the film plays backwards and it's these questions that keep us guessing and wanting to find out what happened before.If the story wasn't enough, the performances are also terrific. Guy Pearce is absolutely fantastic as Leonard. His way of delivering dialogues, especially the monologues, was excellent. Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano also do a great job with their characters.Memento blew my mind. What Christopher Nolan achieved with this film in terms of filmmaking and storytelling is nothing short of astounding. This film just shows how you don't need a large budget to make a good film. It's definitely in my Top 2 of Nolan's movies and one that has to be seen by everyone."
nourkov,"Mar 10, 2021",9/10,"This movie is by far the most original I have ever seen.
Keeps you guessing till the end.
Some memories are so painful you would rather forget."
Thanos_Alfie,"Mar 24, 2021",8/10,"""Memento"" is a Mystery - Thriller in which we watch a man trying to remember his last movements and find out the murderer of his wife. Suffering from short-term memory loss makes things very hard and he will struggle a lot to remember anything.I liked this movie very much because it had a very interesting plot consisted of many plot twists that made it even more interesting. The direction which was made by Christopher Nolan was simply amazing and he did an excellent job creating the feeling of unknown and terror to the audience. Regarding the interpretation of Guy Pearce who played as Leonard I have to admit that he was outstanding. Some other interpretations that have to be mentioned were Joe Pantoliano's who played as Teddy and Carrie-Anne Moss' who played as Natalie. Lastly, I have to say that ""Memento"" is an interesting movie and I recommend everyone to watch it but I suggest you to follow the plot very carefully otherwise you will be completely lost and you won't understad anything."
Swift-12,"Dec 9, 2004",N/A,"MEMENTO is a film about a brain-damaged man who cannot retain short-term memories and whose sense of self is limited to whatever longterm memories he'd formed before his injury. Most folk either love it or hate it or are indifferent to it (have I covered all the bases?) but only because they either love or hate or are indifferent ... to GIMMICKY movies. A friend once asked, ""How do you spell GIMMICK backwards? OTNEMEM. But they miss the point -- ""Memento"" is not a mere novelty nor an exercise in backwards narrative. This is an exploration of what it is to be human. What generates a mind, or how does a brain store a mind? How can a person function or an identity be formed if they cannot REMEMBER? In fact, if our brain is creating our mind then what happens to it when we fall into the oblivion of sleep? Perhaps each night we die. And each morning are recreated through the power of regenerative memory. Do concepts like ""soul"" even apply anymore, in this age of neuroscience where we've gained insights into the physiologic and microscopic energies of what makes up a ""thought""? The backwards-chronology narrative is a brilliant device to put the viewer into the protagonist's confusion. But like any mystery, ultimately we are asking ... ""what happens next? and what will the final answer be?"" Returning to my harangue about neuroscience, on one level *any* film or TV show is creating a reality within your mind. At least to the extent that you let yourself get immersed in it. For what is the difference between the true external world about us and some artificial world we tune into? For all that we hear and see is filtered through our senses. The true and the false are all just impressions that we experience, whatever is ""out there"" is separate from us and must be interpreted by us. This is why I think mysteries are such an intriguing genre for most of us. For life itself is a mystery. Our physiologic make-up is constantly probing the world about us and asking, asking, asking ""what's going on out there?"" Therefore it's only natural that a book or movie is going to hook us if we get caught up in the questions, ""what has happened here? Who dunnit? How will it turn out?"" Because subconsciously we are constantly being presented with riddles by our own senses. And in Leonard Shelby we have a character whose senses still create a world about him, except he doesn't possess the means to correctly interpret this reality."
jaewoo93,"Dec 13, 2012",10/10,"""Where am I?"" The first line blows away my mind each time I watch this movie. I had to watch Memento several times to understand what was going on in the movie. The story plot is intriguing and complicated. Yet, there is a pattern to it once you get a hold of it. I personally think that it adds immense depth to the movie. The greatest thing about this movie is that each time you watch it, you always get a different meaning out of it. Ever since I have seen this movie, I have shown it to my friends, and all of them enjoyed seeing this. I often find myself watching this movie when I am sad or caught up with stressful things that happened recently.The premise of this movie is that main character, otherwise seeming ordinary, has this ""condition"" where he cannot make a new memory since his accident. But the movie is about more than that. It's hard not to reflect ourselves while watching the character struggles to grasp the truth and to find who killed his wife. Memento is also about moving on from the painful past and letting things go, which are two of hardest tasks we ordinarily go through each day. The wall between our memory and imagination is, in fact, very thin. Director Nolan does an excellent job in portraying that small wall, and suggesting that we all have this power and will when it comes to our own memory. Our memory is fragile and uncertain, yet it still exists in a certain form. Memento shows how we have this beautiful ability to recall and recreate the past events. Such creative power defines us as human, and as a result of that, a sequence of events turn into a journey of ultimate truth. What he finds at the end of this movie might be something that we are all seeking for in life.When you are uncertain about your life, Memento is a great movie to watch and remind yourself about the complexity of your own memory and mind. The movie often leaves me with the high appreciation for memory. What our mind can do is quite remarkable. Although Nolan's Inception was bigger scale and had more actions in it, Memento remains to be my favorite Nolan movie."
berestov,"Aug 28, 2025",7/10,"I came across some kind of fan version by accident, which was a chronological montage. The magic of cinema is lost from this, because it looks like an unfinished product, so you definitely shouldn't start with this version of the acquaintance.Very high marks. It's a detective thriller, which means it's going to be crazy, but in the end... I wasn't surprised before, and even more so now. It's not a bad idea in itself, but it's implemented through a non-linear narrative and memorable details, whether polaroid or tattoo, but what's the point of all this if the film doesn't have an ending?Depending on whose interview and what year you watch and whose opinion of those involved in the creation you will find more correct, that's why you will come up with the ending. And there are also questions about the plot in terms of its ambiguity of interpretation.Although against the background of thousands of films that have a plot in the form of a straight line with a bold dot at the end, this picture stands out strongly. This is what apparently catches on."
LouisSyphon,"Feb 9, 2020",10/10,Beautifully constructed with a peerless ensemble cast. Intelligent film-making at its best
john-collie-1,"Jul 9, 2023",10/10,"In the realm of cinematic storytelling, there are few films as brilliantly bewildering as Christopher Nolan's Memento (2000). A spellbinding cocktail of inventive narrative structure, razor-sharp script, and outstanding performances, Memento is a dizzying journey into the mind of a man with a condition as tragic as it is fascinating.Nolan's directorial skill truly shines in his handling of the film's unique, non-linear structure. Told through two sequences - one in color and moving forward in time, the other in black and white and moving backwards - Memento challenges conventional storytelling, as it gradually unspools a narrative that is as engaging as it is puzzling.In the heart of this narrative labyrinth is Guy Pearce, delivering a performance of raw intensity and remarkable vulnerability as Leonard Shelby, a man suffering from short-term memory loss. Pearce's Leonard is a complex character, whose quest to avenge his wife's murder, despite his condition, forms the crux of the story. His painstakingly scribbled notes, Polaroid photos, and tattooed reminders are as heartbreaking as they are intriguing.The supporting cast, including Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano, excel in their roles, adding layers of uncertainty and intrigue to the narrative. Moss, in particular, delivers a hauntingly mercurial performance that keeps you guessing about her character's motivations till the very end.The film's screenplay is another feather in its cap. Rich in suspense and spiced with dry wit, it weaves a web of ambiguity that keeps you glued to the screen, compelling you to piece together the jigsaw puzzle that is Leonard's memory. The dialogue is sharp and memorable, contributing to the film's overall atmospheric intensity.Memento (2000) is a testament to the art of cerebral cinema. It's a film that forces you to question, to reason, and to remember. As each piece of the puzzle falls into place, you find yourself drawn deeper into the story, appreciating the beauty of its construction and the mastery of its execution. It's not just a film; it's an experience, one that leaves you pondering long after the credits roll.In a cinematic landscape often saturated with predictable plots and safe storytelling, Memento stands out as a boldly inventive and deeply engrossing masterpiece, confirming Christopher Nolan's place among the great directors of our time. This film is, without a doubt, a must-watch for any cinephile."
Matin_Shwany,"Jan 19, 2020",10/10,"Memento (So Where Are You), its just a normal story told in a way that anyone wouldnt think of it, the most interesting thing about this movie its the way how its told, like do you wanna watch a movie inversely Ex: from the ending to start, well that what makes you feel different from others, this how the director wanted it to be, this is a piece of unique material found in cinematic world, from the start you have the conclusion but you need to discover why why and why things went this way, every single scenes that appears makes you to ask yourself questions many and many questions till the end until the puzzle is solved even after seeing the puzzle as a solved thing you still have questions its really complicated in terms of how its made that makes the watcher confused, i wasn't rushed nor confused to see what the ending delivers i was just calm with it since everything i saw means something to find something, i truly believe this is a unique art of cinematic world, its told in away thats not original itself is a pure original, there could be many different theories from others prescriptive but its justified well as what it is, it leads the watcher to feel confused and uncertain about what they saw, i searched and read many things on the story about how it went on until i got the results that things were on point, at last its rare thats created by original ideas we might not see things like that again, highly recommended, 10/10⭐"
petervd,"Apr 4, 2018",9/10,"Just watched Memento on netflix, I knew about the movie and everybody told me I had to watch it, but I was not prepared! This movie definitely earned its praise, and now it is one of my top 10 favorite movies"
zihniozel,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,The movie that Christopher Nolan announced was not the only event in the film to rewind. The aim of the director is to present you the illness of the protagonist who lost memory in 3-minute sections. Simple scenario is perfect presentation.
sant2050,"Dec 28, 2008",9/10,"I also have frantically started writing. I want to make note of the movie lest I forget it. The movie has ingrained a sense of condition in me as well. Leonard says the memory can change, the color of the car can change. True?? One of the puzzling pieces was the presence of a picture of Lenny bare chested and happy. It doesn't have a caption and he doesn't question why. He is conditioned you see, he is confident. Leonard believes he can lead the life as the police conducts investigation, taking notes, relying on facts. Well, the problem is what are facts? All in all, a puzzling movie and it drives the viewer also into the whirlwind of thinking. It challenges your notions of being, notions of certainty. It's not just a movie, it's more than that. ""Memento"" is an episode in your life which presses you hard."
gortx,"Oct 14, 2001",N/A,"Come on, folks. As I write this, MEMENTO is listed as the 9th BEST FILM OF ALL TIME? Yeah, right. I'm not going to come down too hard on this, but this is one of those films which is so concerned with how cleverly it tricks the audience (6TH SENSE, USUAL SUSPECTS) that it inevitably will be a let down when all the plot mechanics are revealed as a giant ruse. Not to say that clever plotting is bad, but the final results have to be a revelation - or carry a deeper resonance (i.e. THE CONVERSATION, Godard's LA CHINOISE or Bunuel's masterpiece BELLE DE JOUR) not just a cheap cinematic trick. Check out Nolan's FOLLOWING for a better, less cynical, treatment of a similar theme."
peterpearce-58025,"Oct 4, 2017",7/10,Memento was a very good film about a man called Lenny with anterograde amnesia and in order to progress with his journey he takes photographs and write on them to remember. The storyline uses a technique called fabula and ceujet which is Russian and means the story line from the black and white to the colour crosses over after building from different points.
rmerzbacher,"Oct 12, 2012",10/10,"Never have I seen a movie that had as much of an impact on me as Memento did. I just finished watching it for the fourth or fifth time and at the end of it I am still acting strangely. I'm thinking differently and I'm acting differently. I keep questioning things and feeling anxious, the same way that Leonard would.The reason for this personality alteration at the end of each viewing is that every time I watch it, I am completely engulfed in the story and the main character. At the end, I feel like Leonard would feel and I can understand what it is like to live with him. It's this feeling that makes this movie different from all others for me. I recommend this movie to everyone, not only for the amazing story but also for the experience.It's unfortunate that IMDb ratings only go up to ten stars."
Atle_O,"Jul 8, 2024",7/10,"I recently watched ""Memento,"" and I thought it was a pretty good movie. At first, I wasn't sure what to expect because the story seemed a bit confusing. The movie starts backward, and that took some time to get used to. But as the movie went on, I found myself getting more and more into it.The main character, Leonard, has short-term memory loss and is trying to find his wife's killer. The way the story is told, with scenes shown in reverse order, really made me feel what Leonard was going through. I felt his frustration and confusion, and it made me root for him even more.I liked how the director, Christopher Nolan, used black-and-white scenes to show the past and color scenes for the present. It helped me keep track of what was happening, which was important since the timeline was all over the place.Guy Pearce did a great job as Leonard. He made me believe in his struggle and his determination. The supporting characters, like Teddy and Natalie, added to the mystery and kept me guessing about their true intentions.By the time the movie ended, I realized how clever the plot was. The twists and turns kept me engaged, and I appreciated the film more as it went on. It's not the kind of movie you can just watch casually; you really have to pay attention. But that's what made it satisfying. It felt like I was piecing together a puzzle along with Leonard.Overall, ""Memento"" is a movie that grows on you. It starts off a bit slow and confusing, but as the pieces come together, it becomes a gripping and thought-provoking experience. I'm glad I stuck with it because, in the end, it was definitely worth watching."
LarryD-3,"Oct 27, 2001",1/10,"I checked out IMDB to find a good movie to rent.  Saw that 'Momento' was ranked 9 on the all time list.  My wife remembered seeing it at the local store yesterday, so I rushed to get it!As I was reaching for it, a lady next to me said ""it's not that good"".I thought, ""yea right, 16000 IMDB movie reviewers are calling this a top ten of all time movie, and you are saying it's no good...""Well, she was right, and 16000 IMDBers were wrong.  Not really a good movie. Don't believe the hype.  Pass this one up!"
Michael-Zanoni,"Dec 14, 2004",10/10,"Just for all of you who seem to have a problem with this movie, I need you to wake up and smell the coffee. I even saw some person complaining that some people see its better than The Godfather, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, and other instant classics. The problem with these people is that their mind is too closed to see the difference between these movies and a movie like Memento. Memento was shot on a low budget. This means actors like Pacino, etc etc... can not be cast easily. For Pearce, this is one of his best performances, hands down. Also, Pantoliano and Moss deliver a completely unique perspective on characters in any film. The best part about the two is the constant flip flopping of good and evil within them. You never truly get a grasp on whether one is trying to help or hurt Pearce on his ""mission."" And if its realism that people are complaining about (Lenny's condition mainly), go back and check your own favorites for realism, I'm sure not every part is factual and actually possible. With films in the independent genre of film, it is important to keep an open mind, and see what the director and writer(s) have to offer you. The reason they are independent in the first place is to stray from traditional Hollywood production values. Everything the directing, writing, and editing throw into this film has a purpose to the storyline. The performances may not be the best all around (except Pearce), but the story makes up for it. It truly keeps you on your toes and (so cliché in saying this) ""makes you think"" but on a different realm. Not only are you trying to piece together what is happening, but why the person in charge of a certain aspect did it that way. That's all I have to say... if you'd like to have an intelligent conversation about movies, I'm game. Drop me an e-mail. What I can't take is the ignorant bashing movies with low production values (like this one) just because they aren't loaded with millions of dollars worth of actors and special effects. Smell ya later."
AgustinCesaratti,"Jan 11, 2020",10/10,"Wow, Christopher Nolan is truly a genius. Probably one of the best original movies ever made, the screenplay and directing from Christopher Nolan is incredible and he deserved more recognition.This is a rare film because it's going backwards while the black and white scenes go in chronological order and that is a smart move and not an easy one. You need to see this film before you die.Now, where was i?"
bharatmisr,"Feb 3, 2009",10/10,"Distinguished director Christopher Nolan comes out with his second directorial venture 'Memento', and this one surpasses every movie of its genre. The first fifteen minutes of the movie are completely undecipherable to the viewer, as it takes time for the audience to figure out the unique style of multiple narratives and reverse story-telling used by the director. After that, though, the movie grips your senses and takes you on a suspense-filled ride, and the suspense does not end until the credits start rolling down. The climax of the movie takes you off-guard and you keep on thinking about the movie for days. You have to watch it at least twice to understand each and every scene and dialogue. The movie has a great concept, and an excitingly taut storyline. Guy Pearce acts marvelously well, especially in scenes when he forgets his whereabouts and the identities of people he meets. Carrie-Anne Moss does full justice to her character, though her dialogue delivery is somewhat sloppy. Joe Pantoliano acts wonderfully, as usual. This one is my personal favorite in the genre of psychological thriller. The movie is refreshingly innovative, and I'm sure that viewers looking for an intelligent plot and a lightning-fast narrative. would revere this as the best piece of cinema of all time. The gritty direction also allows each and every character develop deeply, engrossing the viewers even more. Nolan is a master film-maker, and steers the movie through the mind of the protagonist, delivering a gripping thriller. He focuses more on the mentality of the characters, rather than the physical elements of the story. It somewhat reminds me of the short story 'The Sphinx without a Secret' by Oscar Wilde. All in all, this one is a must-watch, and your Hollywood viewing is incomplete without watching 'Memento'."
theoledoux,"Aug 19, 2020",10/10,I am writing this review so I can remember my thoughts just after finishing this film. This movie makes me want to watch it again in order... But I know that it will all tie itself together as I want it to be. Am I lying to myself so I can be happy? Maybe...
jamiecostelo58,"Jan 15, 2009",10/10,"Its most likely many viewers will think that filming a motion picture in reverse order makes it either ridiculous or over-the-top, but taking one look at Memento makes you realise that it actually works so well. I, for one, thought this cannot work in any shape or form. Upon viewing this movie, I believed I would be able to read through the plot and have everything (and anything) worked out in a flash, thus strengthening my notion that this 'back-to-front' concept is nonsense. How wrong was I? Memento is a film that makes you to go into the difficult and turbulent mind of a man trying his damnedest to seek revenge upon his wife's killer, but because of a condition which prevents him for remembering very recent events, finds it extremely difficult to do so; Guy Pearce is nothing short of brilliant as Lenoard, and certainly proves how versatile an actor he is. The perception of Memento is such, after only a few minutes of watching a particular scene, we are forced to reevaluate events witnessed. Its this strong aspect of the film that makes it so groundbreaking and legendary.The final scene in Memento will leave the viewer trying hard to think what situation was what and how a certain situation occurred. Personally, I'm not sure why a certain event happened, but then again that is the whole point. Recording a film in reverse would normally be a complete waste of time, but watching Memento certainly discourages that thought. Excellent."
hellas-16495,"Oct 30, 2015",7/10,"I like the way it is filmed, quite new at the time.I like the concept but it is used too much, too much exploited. We see the same scenes again and again. It is a good thriller though, we have a different portrait of the character since we go backwards.The actors Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano do a great performance.Most of my friends really enjoyed the movie, so did I. We try to figure out the movie during the whole time, thanks to the concept. It makes us think and the story is not predictable, which is nice. Of course it can be confusing, and some people don't like these kind of movies. For me the ambiguity is what makes the film great."
anshuwaliabhishek,"Feb 21, 2024",10/10,"Mind you, you need a considerable high IQ to watch this in one go and wrap your mind around the story.The movie puts all of your brain cells to work and is just a masterpiece in cinematic story-telling. I would have watched a ton of movies but none of them came close to boggle my mind as Memento does.This is the original movie on which very very loosely is based Ghazni except that Ghazni is just 20-30% of what is entwined in Memento 2000.It is truly the loss of so many streaming platforms that they don't Memento and of the whole movie watching community as you have to pirate it to watch it, as far as I know no major streaming platform is streaming it as of now - Feb 2024Thanks."
Duncan07,"Aug 24, 2023",7/10,"The film is good and the writing is really intelligent. It is also refreshing in a way that it is smart and done intelligently. It changes a bit from other films that I've seen. We have a man who has a short term memory after an accident and tries to discover who has killed his wife. In a way it seems kind of basic but the fact that the story is reversed makes it more interesting and makes you think about the outcome of the film. This isn't a film I would give a 8+ rating because although the film is good, and has smart writing it just wasn't really gripping and I didn't enjoy it that much. It wasn't really for me."
LoveCoates,"Dec 16, 2001",1/10,"Sigh.Let me first point out the tremendous amount of good in this film.First, Christopher Nolan and young filmmakers like him are to be commended and supported for stretching cinematic conventions and taking chances with the medium. Memento is certainly an important film, a very innovative move from the older flashback structure that has gotten to be somewhat overused. What a refreshing directorial debut, to the point that I think it rivals Orson Welles's famous directorial debut. Kudos to Chris Nolan!Also, there is Guy Pearce. He is outstanding in what must have been an extremely challenging role, and I cannot praise him enough. He succeeds in making us feel sympathetic for a character we never really understand, and that is indeed difficult. To me, this performance is head and shoulders above most if not all lead male performances of the same year.Skip the bad, onto the ugly.Some have tried to give the rest of this film the benefit of the doubt. I cannot. This is another one of those annoying intellectual-exercises-disguised-as-motion-picture a la American Beauty whose popularity I can only ascribe to their sheer complexity. The latter tried to use a complex theme to pass for worth; this one tries a complex structure.Unfortunately, the foundation of a good movie will always be a good, cogent story with strong, well-developed characters (at least in my opinion). Memento has neither. Told forwards, the plot (or non-plot) would be mediocre, even boring. As it is, told backwards, it just makes no sense. I'm not sure it would make sense told regularly. Inventiveness is great, but it is not enough to make a film one of the greatest films of all time (ahem, Citizen Kane). I would put Memento up there with Kane as one of the greatest DIRECTORIAL EFFORTS of all time. But simply put, great direction alone does not equal great film. There are also such things as writing and character, which have been lost in the age of the auteur.I cannot be the first to have noticed the plot's crucial non-sequitor. If the main character couldn't remember anything after the incident, he wouldn't be able to remember that he has a memory problem. However, he constantly tells people this, and it proves to be of central importance to the plot (which is full of other holes). He also has nothing that he would see every morning to remind him. I understand that in real life, this condition does allow you to remember some things, but the film makes it clear that the main character remembers nothing. I'm not merely picking at the film, for this plot hole actually is the plot. And I'm not quite sure how Chris Nolan or anybody involved with the film managed to miss it. Maybe they didn't care? That's likely, because this film does center more around slick direction than great writing.There is a saying that applies: to break the rules, you need to know them. This movie could have been brilliant if Christopher Nolan had taken the time to write a wonderful movie in real time. THEN, had he decided to tell it backwards, the effect, if done right, would have been awesome. However, I left this film just as confused as I was throughout. Even the endless speech at the end that was (I think?) supposed to tie everything up did not help, not to mention the fact that the ""long explanation by an authority"" is a trite, amateur denouement to begin with. It hasn't really worked since Psycho -- which, lord have mercy, is apparently a lesser film than Memento according to IMDB voters -- since the Psycho ending speech was merely tying up loose ends that the audience already knew rather than rewriting the film in seconds like this one does.Frankly, I'm sick of movies that cater either to the box office (Titanic, Gladiator), or critics (American Beauty & now Memento), and somehow end up being branded as great. Movies should be watchable and entertaining, not simply there to win awards so that film nerds can pat each other on the back congratulating their brilliance.If you want writing, character, plot, direction AND complexity, see The Shawshank Redemption or All About Eve. Memento is not the movie for you, and so far its the most overrated movie of the century."
ChristopherNolanFan,"Dec 1, 2008",10/10,"""Memento"", directed by Christopher Nolan, starring Guy Pearce, Carrie Anne-Moss and Joe Pantoliano is an Independent Film masterpiece that conveys and depicts one man's love for his wife and what he will do to seek justice for her murder. It is a film that is sure to stand the test of time.Leonard Shelby (Pearce) is on a mission to hunt down the man that he believes raped and murdered his wife-however, there is one prominent dilemma, Leonard suffers from a rare case of Anterograde Memory Disorder (AMD), also known as 'short-term memory loss'. He administers this issue by using notes and tattoos to hunt down the man he only knows as 'John G'. While he is receiving help from his companions; Teddy (Pantoliano) and Natalie (Moss) he begins to believe that one of them is using his mental disability to manipulate and work against him. The film brings up questions in Leonard's personal mind; who can be trusted? Who cannot be? He dearly loves and misses his wife and time heals all wounds, but how is one supposed to heal if they can't feel time?""Memento"" sends the viewer on an emotional but dark journey through one man's adoration for a woman and its striking originality with a different plot setting than ever seen before make it without a doubt the greatest Indie Film of all time.10/10."
damianphelps,"Sep 12, 2020",10/10,"Masterpiece is a word that get's thrown around a lot, sometimes deserving and sometimes not. In the case of Memento it is truly justified.The movie demands that you pay attention and dutifully rewards you for doing so.Original storytelling with outstanding performances from Joe, Moss and Guy, deliver a totally satisfying experience.If you are looking for more from your movies...start here."
mbanwait,"Sep 2, 2002",10/10,"This movie will definitely turn your world upside down.  Hard to follow at first, but after about 10 minutes you get used to the story running backwards.  It is a crime that this movie did not get many more Oscar nominations including one for Guy Pearce.  But I am sure this film will not be forgotten in the years to come similar to other movies such as Fight Club and The Insider.  Truly need to watch this movie more than once to enjoy it!"

irisg70,"Dec 7, 2003",10/10,"'Memento's' plot backtracks through the events that led up to the point when the viewer begins watching it. Although for years movies have been using flashback sequences to tell their stories this one actually rewinds and overlaps it just enough to keep you abreast. At the beginning of the movie the viewer feels much like Guy Pearce's character in that they know as much about what happened and why as he does. Anyone who has a problem with their short term memory should feel much sympathy for him and anyone who doesn't should, at least, see how it can be taken for granted. It also gives new meaning to 'Post-it(R)' notes."
silviopellerani,"Sep 3, 2001",6/10,"I have always in mind that most of the films shown at The Sundance Film Festival in a way or in another are interesting, this is one of those.A despaired man has lost his ""immediate memory"" due to the murder and rape of his wife. His thirst of revenge but do not keep anything in his memory so he is obliged to tattoo and take notes of important events, names, places, etc.. The film is shot in a sort of flashback which you start to understand it after at least 30 minutes.It is an original film which has slightly reminded me the Italian film  ""The Mnemonist"", this one plays more with the spectator to get a sort of thrilling effect.Rating: 6/10"
Doylenf,"Aug 23, 2005",3/10,"I can scarcely believe the cult status this film seems to be getting here at the IMDb board. It's a totally enigmatic mess of a nightmare ""from end to beginning"", to coin a phrase based on the fact that the story is told backwards.If it made even one iota of sense to me, it was only toward the end when I had a clue as to what I suspected all along. But even then, nothing was clear and much of the story is unresolved so that you, the viewer, can fill in all the gaps depending on how brilliant and imaginative your mind is.The storytelling technique used here is a tricky one and altogether unsuccessful, in my opinion. As far as I'm concerned, short term memory would be a blessing if only to forget this one entirely. The payoff is zero, as Leonard Maltin has already suggested, and makes watching a film like this a total waste of time.GUY PEARCE does an okay job in the central role but his talent is totally wasted in a script that is as ungrounded in reality as his character is supposed to be. The film itself is all style and no substance, as pretentious and manipulating as any film can be that does not respect its audience.JOE PANTOLIANO and CARRIE-ANNE MOSS are competent but their characters are given coarse language full of expletives that should have been directed at the script they were forced to recite rather than inflicted upon a viewer patiently trying to follow a deliberately incomprehensible storyline. What hurts here, is there is no real solution to the puzzle, leaving the audience just as confused as the central character.What should have been a taut film noir turns out to be nothing more than a cheap shot at manipulation.Apparently, audiences these days are willing to swallow anything that seems unusual or offbeat in its appeal but--even so--there is no way I can account for the sort of comments I see here. Are we watching the same film???"
Chris_Docker,"Oct 22, 2000",8/10,"Tightly acted and directed, and brilliantly adapted from a short story that used an unusual idea for a mystery thriller: supposing the central figure can only remember things that happened a long time ago or within the last 15 minutes? The psychological condition where someone, after a trauma, cannot create new memories, is vividly recreated as we are introduced to 15 minute segments one at a time, in reverse chronological order.To pull this off and maintain smooth continuity is quite a feat, which is why this movie is such a remarkable accomplishment. We are as bewildered as Leonard (played by Guy Pearce) as he searches for the man who brutally raped and killed his wife. He leaves himself clues in the form of tattooed notes and Polaroid pictures to substitute for memory.The tension towards the climax and gut-wrenching revelations reminded me of the Usual Suspects as I came out of the cinema dazzled by the inventiveness and mental pace which this film achieves."
KP-Nuts,"Mar 9, 2004",9/10,"When I first heard about this movie I hired it on DVD not really knowing quite what to expect. The first scene (or is that last?!) shows a man being killed by a gun but filmed in reverse. Thankfully the rest of the film is not people walking around in reverse etc but carefully layered scenes, each new one set chronologically before the previous.This opens up endless possibilities of twists, turns and humour, which Christopher Nolan takes full advantage of. Guy Pearce is at his absolute best playing Leonard Shelby, the man who cannot make new memories due to an injury sustained whilst himself and his wife were attacked. He therefore has an uphill task finding the true murderer of his dead wife which he has now set as his only goal in life.Matrix stars Carrie-Anne Moss and Joe Pantoliano give excellent support in this gripping and original tale which may take at least a couple of viewings to completely get your head round.The great concept, acting, score and of course editing make this an unmissable thriller."
omarsonnoqrot,"Nov 20, 2023",10/10,"For me memento is the best movie i've ever seen in my hole live a great story line great filming movie and an amazing story by Christopher Nolan what made it more good the fact that not any one can can understand the story because Christopher Nolan had definitely made his best to do a great job to make a unique story a unique film and a unique characters and a unique background for the character, I'm from me from my point of view Leonard Shelby is one of the smartest characters that Christopher Nolan has made in his movies it was very smart a guy who had a short-term memory unlike people thought about him what a masterpiece."

slf_kiki,"Oct 6, 2024",10/10,"Memento directed by Christopher Nolan is definitely one of the best suspense film in my view. This is true not only because of the special editing technique, but due to the perfect combination between the editing technique and the plot of the film. The editing technique could be divided into two timeline. One of timeline goes in the direction of time, and the other timeline is the exact opposite, from the end of the story to the beginning. At last, the two timeline meets in the resolution of the film. Some people claim that Memento used this edit technique just to impress the public, and isn't really a fine suspense film. However, if one could keep track of the way the story is told, he/she can see that the structure of the story is actually very rigor and well developed.The plot of the story itself isn't such an impressive story, because it doesn't have any twist, all plans and truth of the events in the story are told at the beginning. However, Nolan used editing and placed the twist of the story in the second timeline of the story, which makes the twist of the story placed at the end of the film. For other films, twists are always at the end of the story, so audience would wonder ""what would happen after due to the action of the characters before?"". Instead, in Memento, audience should wonder ""what happened before in the film that made the characters do this?"". Audience watching Memento would be wondering questions like ""who's this character"" ""what's their relationship"" ""why does he want to kill him"" ""what on earth is going on"", and as film moves on, audience will see the motivation of the characters and the reason for them to do a thing. At the end of the film, audience would have the feeling of ""Oh, so that's why xxx did this"" and the plot of the story gradually shows what it really is, which is exactly what's so brilliant about Nolan. Everything is explained at the start of the story. The special effect of the combination of editing and plot plays a significant role in the success of Memento.Moreover, this special sequence of arranging story scenes also fit the condition of the main character. The protagonist of the story of Memento has a problem to store memories. He can only remember the things that happened before he's hit heavily by a man on the back of his head (which is when he got his condition) and things that happened about 15minutes ago. Or in another word, his memory is refreshed every 15 seconds. To him, life is like many pieces of memory, and is very hard to put together. This way of storing memories connects with the way audience felt about the film. Both the audience and the protagonist is always wondering what's going on and having only few pieces of information. Therefore, the audience can somehow feel the way the pro is feeling."
clark-39,"Jul 27, 2002",N/A,"I can't say this was a fun film to watch, for the most part I was too busy getting frustrated trying to make sense of it all. Really, it makes you mad. But it deserves a lot of credit because it is very creative and ambitious, and overall a great film. It was only after the film was over that I realized I had just seen a great movie. Some advice: don't rent this movie and just expect to sit back and watch it with some popcorn and some buddies. This film requires an enormous amount of participation from the viewer. There are facts to remember, people, places, events, etc. And to make it even worse, the movie plays backwards, in intervals. Don't let any of this scare you. See this movie, the agony of trying to piece the thing together is worth it. Very different, very good, definitely worth seeing. If you can handle it."
trildog99,"Sep 26, 2002",10/10,"I have seen a few bad reviews about the movie Memento, every one stating the movie is no more than a gimmick.  If by gimmick they mean, one of the most original ways of directing a movie, they are right.  I think these people are use to the same old plots with the same old happy endings.  They might as well watch another movie based on an American tragedy with lovers in the mix of things (you know what movies I'm talkin about).  Memento, on the other hand, is like no movie you have ever seen before.  It's one of the greatest (perhaps even thee greatest) thiller ever put together.  It's one of the few movies that has plot twist and has the actors stay true to their characters.  If you like movies that are creative and make you think, Memento is the movie for you."
shea-8,"Oct 14, 2001",1/10,"Memento is far from an original concept and the plot closely resembles Swiss-cheese. It quite simply does not warrant the praise given it, which I suspect is heavily weighted by the 15-21 male demographic (see Bottle Rocket). The blatant contradictions presented by the sub-standard writing are conveniently covered with mind-numbing violence (as opposed to that which is stimulating, thereby justifying the waste of 90 minutes of my life). Ooh! I have no memory; it must be a ""condition""!If you don't get it because it is so ""mind-blowing"", wait until you grow up and understand that being confused by the story doesn't indicate clever writing. I can't stress enough, SAVE YOUR VOTE UNTIL PUBERTY IS OVER! At the very least, commit to a second viewing before casting! It is simply embarrassing to indicate that this movie is rated as #9 by US voting standards (what are the French going to think?). It is going to lower the standards of movies being produced worldwide!Resist the temptation to fall into the pit of hype! Watch Groundhog Day instead."
rhinestone_cowgirl,"Aug 28, 2002",10/10,"I mean really, this movie is told backwards, but it has to be the most creative storytelling I've ever seen. You would think that this would take away any suspense, but instead it adds to it.

epsilon3,"May 13, 2002",10/10,"If I had to choose one word to sum up this movie it'd be 'ingenious.'Leonard Shelby has a rare memory disorder - he can't remember anything since he had a blow on the head after fighting with his wife's killer. He knows everything about himself up to that point, but new memories gradually fade and are quickly lost. He'll be talking to someone but will forget how the conversation started. He'll wake up in a hotel room completely ignorant of how he got there. Since his last memory is of his dying wife, he lives in grief and his only goal in life is to catch and kill John G - his wife's murderer.The film opens with the final scene in the plot and gradually takes you back through the story so that you only know why events take place after they've occurred.This means that you instantly empathize with Leonard - there's no way you couldn't as like him, you don't 'remember' what's gone before. It's a rare breed - a movie that manages to transfer you into the mind of the main character using the film making technique rather than the plot. Like it or not, while watching it YOU TOO have a memory disorder and are forced to see the world through Leonard's eyes - truly ingenious.As it goes on, you gradually realise that all isn't it seems and nobody is as they appear. I'm not going to give anything else away as it'll spoil it, but suffice it to say that it has a great twisting story, excellent acting and is shot beautifully in a minimalist noirish kind of way.It's a film that needs multiple viewings - I certainly had to watch it two or three times before I understood exactly what's going on, but when all the pieces finally fit together it's a great feeling. The region 2 DVD has a hidden feature that allows one to watch the film rearranged in the correct order (it even has the credits running backwards at the beginning etc) which means that when you've finally worked it all out, you can check that your deductions are correct and that you properly understood. This is a brilliant feature and certainly adds to the film's longevity.There are very few films that offer an experience as engrossing as this, although it's not for everyone. If you're the kind of person that likes to work things out for yourself using the available evidence (just like Leonard) then this is for you. If you like your movies to be clear cut and easy to understand on the original viewing, this may not be to your taste.For me, it's one of the greatest films of recent years and comes wholeheartedly recommended."
kenhuseyin943,"Aug 14, 2022",9/10,"A little bit slow, but the objective of the movie is to confuse the viewers so we can empathise with how the main character is also disoriented himself. Be patient and focused, if you understand the movie then it's impeccable."
rogerslevi,"Jul 13, 2020",10/10,Christopher Nolan has proved that there's more than one way to tell a story even in the beginning of his career he was doing things different. Every moment is crafted with precision.
collt091,"Dec 17, 2022",10/10,"I came into this movie, expecting a pretty normal thriller, I had heard the premise, I knew that he tattooed words on his body to remember things about his wife's murder. And that idea alone is fascinating, but I could never have imagined how deep is the movie goes into the psychosis of the main character and the surrounding world, from the first couple minutes of the movie, we are presented a main suspect, in our mind. It can't be anyone else, but him, and within the first couple minutes of the movie he is killed by the main character. This threw me off big time when I first started watching the movie, I thought it was weird. They would kill off the most integral character to the plot in the beginning of the movie. That being said this movie slowly unravels itself, and scene after scene goes further back in time, and slowly opens up many more suspects, maybe even the main character himself killed his wife, the layers of this movie blow my mind. So much deception, false promises, lying, ulterior motives, people pretending to be people they aren't.and this movie, and it's confusing antics never stop at any point in this movie, for some, it is overwhelming, and frankly it is, but another thing about this movie is it reward you for paying attention, if you pay attention there will be hundreds of references to earlier sequences in the movie, personally I could go on forever about the theories of this movie, because this movie ends with no definitive answer or conclusion. Personally, my interpretation of the ending is that he was a crazy person who drove his wife away and because of this he formed this story in his mind that someone killed his wife, and he dedicated his entire life to solving this mystery that he put in his head, I could go on forever by this movie, because simply thinking about this movie after seeing it is tripping me out, there are well over 30 theories that I have about the ending of this movie and ultimately the vagueness and mystery makes this movie what it is......"
drqshadow-reviews,"Nov 13, 2020",9/10,"After stretching his legs in the arthouse scene with 1998's Following, Christopher Nolan gets a little more mainstream in this swervy, concept-rich tale of amnestic vengeance. Guy Pearce plays a man with short-term memory loss, constantly overwriting the VHS tape of his near-past as he tracks a nameless, faceless killer. He employs some blunt methods for retaining important information - hand-written notes and Polaroids for loose facts, tattoos for solid truths - but when you're operating on such a short timer (the dreaded memory wipe seems to occur every ten minutes), I suppose you've got to take what you can get, even if it makes you a target for manipulation.The whole fable unfolds in a sort of stuttered reverse, immediately revealing the plot's ending before slowly walking back to its beginning, which leaves the viewer feeling almost as handicapped as Pearce. It's an early example of Nolan's experimental nature, his interest in tinkering with traditional storytelling formats to bend viewers' perceptions, and it works just as well here as we might expect from his later works. At each intersection, we're forced to second-guess everything we thought we knew, which continually changes the context of that first ten minute chunk. Our trust is earned, betrayed, diverted and rehabilitated.Sure, sometimes it feels like this is more about the experiment than the plot (for all its ambition, the actual story is very small-scale), but conceptual risks carry a lot of weight with me and Memento is a verifiable playground for such things. It's as effective a ""walk a mile in my shoes"" experience as any I've seen on the big screen, and a large part of that can be credited to the Nolan brothers' peculiar knack for outside-the-box cinematic creativity."
monty38427,"Oct 2, 2002",N/A,"It took me a couple of viewings to understand everything going on in the film, and I still have some questions. I will probably watch it many more times and love every minute of it. Guy Pierce gives a brilliant performance.... wonderfully conveying the loss, the frustration, and the determination of his character. Carrie Anne Moss also is wonderful as the mysterious and perhaps untrustworthy piece of the puzzle. Everything about this film is completely original and absorbing from the very start. As I said, I will watch this movie many more times, and take something new from it each time. No one I have talked to about the events of this film, has come to the exact same conclusion. It's a film to be discussed for a very long time.I give it a 10 out of 10 definitely!"

jamesbondandq,"Nov 12, 2001",5/10,"the most annoying thing about this movie is that people claim to like it because it's so revolutionary in it's style and complexity... Cause then i look back on other movies, like 'lost highway' and everyone hates it. Well folks this movie isn't all that revolutionary. First off i'd like to mention a certain convience of this movie, how can the main character remember that he has a memory disorder, yet can't remember anything else? Think about it, he'd constantly live in the present, and be completely unaware of living in the present, the only way he'd know he was living in the present would be if someone was there to tell him that. So that's a MAJOR plot hole. that's not the worst thing about the movie, the worst thing is that the character's are flat, the plot is flat - C'mon a plot about a guy searching for the guy who killed his wife, with NO twists (if seen without the contrived plot)boring characters, and lame dialogue. Watched in regular motion this movie is not interesting at all. Some people were comparing this to Lynch. Well, comparing it to what lynch has done so far, he ALWAYS uses interesting characters and great atmosphere to tell his stories, not just some lame plot contrivance. The movie isn't terrible, it has it's moments, but it's annoying that it's getting so much praise when movies like lost highway get trashed. Look at Pulp Fiction, Tarantino didn't use just the plot contrivence to make his movie interesting... oh ya and i didn't re read this, bollocks to all the grammar and spelling errors!5/10 Boring, contrived story, with flat characters, the only saving grace is the surprises that occasionally pop up. Although the movie is ultimately completely let down by a REALLY lame ending, c'mon, they could've thought of something more interesting... If they had i would've considered giving this a 6 or 7. NOT A MASTERPIECE ~!!! Watch Pulp Fiction or The Killing if you wanna see a uniquely told story with Good characters and good dialogue."
txpromotion,"Nov 16, 2022",10/10,"""Inception"" and ""Interstellar"" are a masterpiece of their own, but there is something different about ""Memento"".It feels like there are only you and Leonard, trying to figure things out, and every next scene you realize how cruel and real are Leonard's condition, and, even worse, the people around him. Then you realize it's only YOU. Leonard's condition takes you on a different type of perspective, the loneliness of understanding it while Leonard can't! If you like movies that really reward you for getting into it then I couldn't think of a better movie for you.A movie about memory and habits."
ivanmessimilos,"Oct 10, 2023",10/10,"One of my favorite movies, I watched it several times and enjoyed it every time. I like that the film requires a certain attention and concentration from the viewer, but again the film is not so complicated that one cannot follow and connect the plot. Since the film goes backwards, we get a slightly different perspective because we wonder how it ends, but we don't know how we got to the end. Given that it does not belong to the category of high-budget films, the emphasis is on the story and acting, which is something most important in films, at least for me. As a rule, these are my favorite movies. In principle, we only have three roles in the film and each one is at a high level and they complement each other. I believe most of you have seen this movie (at least once), but I don't want to give away anything about the plot anyway. Here I see a great synergy between the director, actors and screenwriters (Nolan and his brother), but also the editing of the film precisely because of the unusual format of telling the story. Although most things are explained and related, I like how a small part is left up to the viewer's interpretation, just the right amount. For me, it belongs to the category of masterpieces and I will definitely come back to it again and again."
cherimatcha,"Nov 3, 2025",9/10,"One of the most unique and captivating psychological thrillers I've seen. What makes it stand out is the storytelling - it switches back and forth between being chronological (shown in black and white, covering the story from the very beginning) and retrospective (shown in color, covering the story from the very end). At one point, both of those storylines converge into one and that's when the final details are revealed.It is super immersive to watch because it forces you to stay focused on so many details throughout the entire movie such as: polaroids, tattoos, writings, objects, numbers - the more you remember, the easier it will be for you to follow the story and connect the dots later on. Therefore, I would highly advise watching it when you are feeling alert and are able to fully absorb yourself into the story. It also may be beneficial to pause the movie every now and then and go over the story chronologically in your head to keep you on track and prevent confusion.Even if you don't catch everything after the first watch, the movie is very rewatchable. In fact, I would recommend rewatching it even if you understood the plot because it will give you a deeper appreciation for the things you might've missed."
Erkhind,"Jan 20, 2025",10/10,"Love this movie with its's everything,the scenes the gimmick and its's advanced storytelling by Christopher Nolan. The movie is like a puzzle that cannot be solved !! I love this (you need to watch it more than 2 times because of its details and head mixing scenes ) In conclusion this is one of the best movies in history and recommend this for all but not for children because they wont understand it that well. Last but not least a very important tip to everyone who wants to watch it don't watch it while your doing something (eating,reading etc)
You need to watch it fully concentrated and always stop for the parts that come hard."
Venom-UK,"Nov 11, 2000",10/10,"How do I say how great this film is without giving away too much? Gladiator may be the best film out this year for sheer enjoyment, but this is the best film to watch with friends. There is so much to think about in this film that you need a few people to watch it with you so that you can all swap ideas afterwards.Basically, Guy Pearce plays Leonard, a man who suffered brain damage in an incident. This has left him with the inability to create new memories so everything he experiences will be forgotten within minutes unless he records it somehow. This ranges from photographs with hand-written notes on them through to tattoos on his body.The style of the movie is very unusual. The story starts at the beginning and the end, and works its way to the middle from both sides. Now this may sound stupid, but trust me, it works. The first few minutes are confusing, but once you get the idea of what is happening, then you can settle back and enjoy.The only film I can think of that compares to this is The Usual Suspects, but only in the way that you never know if you are being told the truth or not. This one will keep you guessing all the way through and still leave plenty to argue about with your friends.I don't know about other countries, but this film appears to have got zero publicity in the UK. I knew nothing about it until a friend from work phoned me this afternoon asking if I wanted to see it. I'm glad he did as I hate to think I might have missed out on this absolute gem of a film.You should definitely watch this film, but like I say in the subject line, go with some friends. Afterwards, find a quiet table in the pub and talk it through. You will not regret it."
dogukankoc,"Aug 23, 2021",9/10,I watched it only once but I couldn't get the whole story. There are twists hard to get. So may be you should write the incidents down while watching :)
bowermdw,"Sep 16, 2001",N/A,"I don't think this will spoil the movie.  I saw what was said on the official website.So, Leonard avenged his wife's death.  How many times?  As Teddy put it, ""you won't remember.""  Leonard even asks himself how long has it been. The facts that Leonard is tattooing in forward order in black and white cut scenes are the last facts that he needs to draw his conclusions.  So he has been collecting information for awhile.  The conclusions Leonard draws at the end of the film will set up the whole reverse story. It was interesting to start the film at 'Fact 5: Access to drugs' and have him derive 'Fact 5: Drug Dealer'.  What is displayed is the manipulation of Leonard's handicap.  Even though the main characters could be innocent they are all pawns to use him to their ends.  They all make him draw conclusions they plan.  But does their plan work well.  Leonard learns to realize this in reverse, at the end of the film.  To stop it someone will have to be his John G."
luismribeiro,"Oct 13, 2002",7/10,"Don't be fooled.  This is certainly a good film but I strongly believe it has been consistently overrated by most voters.  Its originality - and it's original like hell - has surely generated more enthusiasm among voters than it should have.  When you come to a cold analysis, however, it's definitely not a better film than American Beauty, Vertigo, The Seven Year Itch, Cat on Hot Tin Roof, East of Eden, Mighty Aphrodite, Requiem for a Dream, Chinatown and The Green Mile, to name just a few among a hundred.  Relax, forget the 8.7/10 rating, and enjoy its mind twisting puzzle."
deloudelouvain,"Apr 1, 2022",8/10,"Memento is one of those movies I can enjoy watching more than once. If you give it ten years between you will forget most about it and can fully enjoy this rather complicated story. It's not an easy movie to watch, you have to stay alert, to not miss anything, as the story is mysterious and certainly not obvious. Memento got nominated at the Oscars for Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly for the Screen, and Best Editing. A nice and deserved nomination for Christopher and Jonathan Nolan. Guy Pearce plays the main character and he did a great job, probably one of his better movies. Memento isn't a movie you watch without being extremely concetrated, it's needed to understand the plot. A great plot by the way, ideal for people that like the mystery/thriller genre."
redkiwi,"Jan 25, 2002",6/10,"Don't believe the hype -- people seem to go out of their way to tell you how great this film is.  The truth is that, when it comes to the crunch, it's actually not really anything that special.Pearce, as the man who has no short term memory after he sustains a brain injury when his wife is raped and murdered, is competent enough, but this film does get really annoying in the way that it loops within the plot in order to get you back to the same point you were at 2 minutes ago -- and then moves onto the next scene.That was really annoying.A lot of this only makes sense in the last scene -- when the Sammy story finally comes to a point -- but by then it's taken an effort to sit through a lot of the rest of the film.Make no mistake, it's not bad, but it's not anything sensational either."
adamonIMDb,"Feb 13, 2017",5/10,"If 'Memento' was released this year, there is absolutely no chance it would achieve the average rating of 8.5 that is currently has on IMDb. That rating puts 'Memento' in the top 50 highest rated movies of all time. To say that such a ranking is misleading would be an understatement.This film is unique and like nothing that had previously been attempted before its release. The plot is ambitious and intelligently told, giving the audience an insight into the mind of a short-term memory loss sufferer. The film makes for absorbing, but also frustrating viewing. I got the impression that 'Memento' thinks its better than it really is.Overall, a decent and unique thriller, but the rating is misleading and not a true reflection of the quality of the film. Interesting? Yes. Top 50 of all time? No!"
prantickroy1991,"Jul 24, 2023",8/10,"Memento is a gripping masterpiece of non-linear storytelling that keeps you guessing until the end. Christopher Nolan's direction and brilliant performances create an unforgettable cinematic experience. The non-linear narrative, coupled with breathtaking performances, draws you into the protagonist's world and leaves you questioning every twist and turn. The use of black-and-white and color sequences adds another layer of intrigue to this mind-bending puzzle.As the story unfolds, you find yourself piecing together the fragments of the narrative, sharing in the protagonist's journey to uncover the truth. The film's thought-provoking exploration of memory and reality stays with you long after the credits roll.An absolute must-watch for lovers of psychological thrillers!"
paul-allaer,"Aug 22, 2022",9/10,"As ""Memento"" (2000 release; 113 min) opens, we are at the tail end of a violent confrontation between 2 guys, and someone is holding a Polaroid photo of the scene in his hand. We then go back in time a bit...Couple of comments: this was my first time seeing it again in over 20 years (more on that later). I must admit that I picked up a lot more this time around than I did back then. For example, while of course the story of Leonard, revenging the rape and murder of his wife while dealing with a sever case of short term memory loss (as in: he cannot build new memories), is set in color and in reverse chronological order, I had completely forgotten about the parallel story of Sammy, set in B&W and in regular chronological order. The other magical thing about this movie remains the fact that while we see the end of Leonard's story in the very beginning, it's really about the journey to get to that point that makes the film so compelling. The vision and ambition and talent that Christopher Nolan displays in ""memento"" is frankly astounding, even more so when you realize he wasn't even 30 years old when he made this film. (One of the best scenes in the movie for me is when Leonard is in the middle of a chase, and he can't remember whether he is the hunter or the hunted, no, really!)I saw ""Memento"" during the opening weekend of the 2001 Portland International Film Festival in early February, 2001 (about a month before the movie was released in US theaters, and remember walking away completely overwhelmed (in the best possible way). Of course nobody had ever heard of Christopher Nolan at that time. Now with more than 20 years in hindsight, we can state without a doubt that ""Memento"" is a classic, period, and that Nolan is one of the, if not THE, greatest Hollywood director of this era. But hey, don't take my word for it. I saw ""Memento"" last night on HBO Max, and I encourage you to check it out as well, and draw your own conclusion."
diakonia_alpha,"Mar 4, 2002",10/10,"It's unfortunate that MEMENTO is not receiving the attention of the Academy, or other awards for that matter. In twenty or so years, I believe this movie will finally be given its due rewards. The innovation of the storytelling and the directing of this movie will reshape the art of cinema as we know it. Some movies have employed non-linear structures to tell their stories. Although MEMENTO does indeed have a linear structure (merely inverted), the unique storytelling has never been so integral to the characters and plot of the movie as this one.Even though 2001 ended on a particularly strong note for movies, none surpassed this one in creativity and ambition. While the simpler movies collect all the awards this winter, MEMENTO will be the movie with the most impact upon the medium of filmmaking. I think that that speaks for itself.As far as the movie itself, even if it was played forward, it would be compelling. The fact that it doesn't stick to convention makes it riveting. Guy Pearce proves that he is a great actor, even though he doesn't appear to want stardom. Good for him. Good for us."
vaibhavrainmaker,"May 16, 2021",8/10,"Nolan is a genius. In another century he would be as celebrated as Da Vinci. Watch this movie to understand how Nolan began. Amazing movie, such a simple story, told in such a twisted, complex, state of the art Nolan way."

keihan,"Nov 13, 2001",N/A,"""Everyone complains of his memory, and no one complains of his judgement.""--Francois, Duc de La Rochefoucauld, ""Reflections; or Sentences and Moral Maxims"", 1678The above is a very good quotation to keep in mind as one watches ""Memento"". Believe me, it all makes sense in the final context.My main attraction to this movie was Guy Pierce (whom I became acquainted with via ""L.A. Confidential"") and the nature of the story. Having heard a little of short term memory impairment via a ""20/20"" show long, long ago (as I recall, I believe the particular instances cited were the result of a disease transmitted by eating mussels), I thought that it would be interesting to see how a mystery was being investigated by a man with the same problem. My reaction was the same that I got from watching ""The Limey"". It was NOTHING like I was expecting.The opening sequence sets the tone straight away, up the hill backwards, to borrow a phrase from David Bowie. Like a surreal slideshow, we flash backward and forward from the beginning and end points of Lenny's week(?) to figure out basically what the hell is going on (one of Nolan's smartest moves was to film the earliest sequences in black and white and the time just prior to the opening in color to reduce audience confusion). At first, I believed Lenny because he seemed so calm, rational, and assured in spite of his obvious handicap. SURELY he'd know what he's talking about. (bitter chuckle) More the fool me.The whole of his world is constricted to five minutes at a time. Five minutes where every incident, every insult, every indignity that is heaped on him is flensed from his mind like a stain exposed to bleach unless he considers it important enough to write down. How could one possibly trust such a man who's forgotten why he's running away from a man with a gun (indeed, forgotten that he's being chased and not chasing), that his wife was called a whore by a woman who is supposedly helping him, or that said woman spat into a tankard that he then thoughtlessly drinks from...all of it instantly forgotten at the end of his memory cutoff? Nolan deserves additional credit for not letting Lenny off the hook at the end. Yeah, we can see that he's been used by a few folks, but he's no innocent himself.In a weird way, it reminds me of ""Point Blank"", another one-of-its-kind crime film with some very unorthodox storytelling methods. It had the same sort of flat characterizations (not necessarily a fault, to my mind; watch one of the many versions of ""Hamlet"" if you want characters), the feeling of being unstuck in time, and a protagonist with rigid but flawed moral compass. But there are important differences. ""Point Blank"" was like living someone's life the same way Kurt Vonnegut wrote ""Slaughterhouse Five"". ""Memento"" is like watching a couple of cars start at opposite ends of a long street and end up hitting each other in a head-on collision. The resulting smash-up, as well as that last, casual line, will haunt me for the weeks the way ""Sunset Boulevard"" did. Watch it and see if it doesn't do the same for you."
Timbo_Watching,"Mar 5, 2020",7/10,"I have to say, this film was very interesting to see. It had a really interesting concept and it was great to watch. I did not however enjoy it as much as what I see others have, from seeing other reviews. It's not that I don't understand the plot or something, I just didn't find it as gripping as others make it out to be. Besides that it still was a very solid film that I recommend."
Nation419,"Sep 14, 2021",10/10,I have seen this movie over times times and catch something new each time. The incredibly diverse story telling works for this film.
moviewiz-4,"May 23, 2001",6/10,"Good? I believe this story is good but how can a film maker get the idea of making the story backwards? It simple ridiculous. The plot follow through the story well but this movie will only suitable for expert users, someone who hold at least a bachelor degree to understand this movie well, otherwise, people might think it is a magic or fantasy movie.Also, the ending... what happened next? the screen just turn black and end title rolling. So... at least a last intro should be written. Anyway, enjoyable movie."
malberts1,"Sep 10, 2002",3/10,"First of all, this is not a horrible movie.  It does keep you mildly interested.  But it has several, fatal flaws.One reviewer mentioned that the film was too clever by half.  I totally concur.  The film went out of its way to create something unique, and in the process lost the entire narrative structure.  So when it ends, you barely even know if it happened.  In fact, you don't know that it happened.  If Leonard was delusional about Sammy, then perhaps he was delusional about all the characters in the movie.  The fact is, you will never know.The problem is, this doesn't make for a good film.  Good films are those where the narrative art is enhanced by the photography.  By this measure, the movie fails, as the photography does almost nothing to tell the story, and Guy Pearce is as milquetoast a leading man as there is.  The fact is, the film is about trying to put you in his shoes, to show you what Leonard must have felt like living with no memory, but you end up feeling nothing at all because he is such a bland character actor.I would compare this film in some ways to Se7en--except that Se7en does a much better job telling the story (even if the ending wasn't at all surprising).  The major difference is that you care about what happens to the characters in Se7en.  There is no empathy with Leonard, partly because the film never gives you the chance because it's too busy being clever.Perhaps people will rate it highly, but it is definitely not a Citizen Kane or Casablanca, a movie where you can take it out and watch it over and over again.  It's far too dismal for that.  It's more a movie like Resevoir Dogs, where you like the idea (and perhaps the execution), but the way the story is put together keeps it from being a classic.3/10"
Dello_,"Aug 30, 2024",8/10,"""Memento"" is a very interesting movie, that I suggest watching. The plot is centred around a man who is seeking vengeance for his dead wife but there's a problem: he is unable to form new memories and he forgets everything he discovers. The premise is original but the plot itself is not that complicated if considering in chronological order. However the aspect that makes ""Memento"" a must-watch is the editing and how the narration is constructed. Indeed the sequence in which the events are shown to the viewer creates a sense of intrigue and suspense but, most importantly, it brings the viewer to the same level of the protagonist because for all the duration you feel some sort of confusion and anxiety since you can't understand what is going on. You feel like you are missing something and you are not sure about anything and this is precisely how the protagonist feels due to his unfortunate condition. In addition there are some twists that land pretty well and add up to the merits of the movie. Finally, another great aspect is that you are left with ambiguity and it forces you to rethink to everything you thought up to that point and give your interpretation.In conclusion I think ""Memento"" is a very solid movie and a must-watch due to its peculiar editing and narration that makes it unique."
Shaggers,"Jun 20, 2022",9/10,"This movie is incredible and very unique in how it's story is told; backwards. It shows something then it explains it while the things at the start start to unravel for the viewer, until finally the kicker. It's a film that needs to be payed full attention to for sure, as there's so many little details. The backwards folding mystery. And throughout it make you question the entire film. The acting is solid for most of the actors, and I feel it has no s lister syndrome and doesn't have any improper casting decisions. This kind of story telling is replicated in Nolans newer movies like interstellar and Dunkirk though it's not the exact same, and not a literal backwards story like this. The filmography in this movie works effectively, but has not much of note, the zoomed out shots for most of it and it's very few close ups shows the bigger pictures, and the whole environment, black and white scenes for the very far back ones though, which eventually collide as we roll back the tape. It definitely isn't using the highest quality camera though even for the 2000s, but this is a fairly low budget movie. The effects are done well for that as well, and the makeup. The set design is also good, with it's world of just being a mid sized city like any other. This film does the feeling of mystery to engage the viewer incredibly well. And is able to flesh out the character and his feelings while him forgetting all of them by the next day. His rapid analysis of all the areas fit his monologues and explaining of his pasts life, and there are no inconsistencies of his character. As for all the other characters which are played very well, for most the movie you know about as much as he does which I feel is intentional. Until it unfolds. The music in this movie is very efficient while being quite simple and quiet. Not the best soundtrack, or even notable, but it is done well in here. This film is hard to review without spoilers which I try not to do, but it is a must see if you like Nolan movies, or mystery movies. Or both. And over all I'd say it's a 8.8."
agustinalejandronunez,"Sep 2, 2023",9/10,"The movie is a bit ""slow"" and it's hard to get at the rust time you watch it, but watching it twice will make it a better an experience overall. This great film makes you think on those with a similar disease and how their living is. What I liked the most is that the final is not expected at all and left one thinking what was going on after all. Did a miss something? It's ending like that? For real? And yes it is!The acting is good, mostly from the two main actors who represent to Leonard and teddy, simply an awesome movie. I've watched it years ago and still I have the feeling that I had when I watched for first time. Super recommended."
mrcollingwood,"Dec 18, 2019",9/10,"One of my favourite movies, Nolan's Memento is just genius Filled with suspense and a fractured narrative that shows that there will NEVER be another movie with such an unique tone in it's narrative again."
Behdinderakhshan,"Aug 28, 2023",10/10,"Memento.Conditioning yourself toward a meaningful purpose is one of the most essential points which is being demonstrated throughout the movie.Now whatever this purpose might be if you are allgince to yourself and your beliefs with the help of conditioning you have the power to fight with the obstacles.The other important thing is that to never trust your memory or feelings for them migh be wrong.Try take notes and stick to the facts more than memories.One tattoo on the body of Leonard says (EAT) this tattoo accurately shows the way which he has conditioned himself with, so he eats more because of this tattoo which helps him to keeo his energy during his adventures hard life.(A story which will keep you alive)
For the case of Leonard there is a tattoo on his hand which says (remember Sammy jankis)
And this is exactly the most important part and also most important tattoo of the movie (memento) this tattoo shows that Leonard has told himself this story over and over so it became part of his life.It means that Leonard keeps himself and his purpose alive sticking to the story of (Sammy jankis)
(Hidden weaknesses)
What we see in memento from Leonard is that he has a straightforward, simple and one line life.He kills according to his hand writings with no feeling of compassion.So he kills not because he likes to kill but according to one his tattoos which says (hide your weaknesses) we know that he kills exactly to proves himself that he shows no weakness
He is no different...
Don't trust is another tattoo on his body.Another lesson that we can learn from (memento)
Is (habits and routine).We can by sticking to a logical habit and making it our routine change lots of things in life.(Learn by repetition)
(Repetition) is one of the really important social and philosophical matters which we has to consider.But in simple term of definition of learning by repetition is that through repetition we can unconsciously gain experience and by experience we can manage the life much better than without."
kenjha,"Dec 28, 2010",6/10,"A man is determined to avenge the murder of his wife, but his mission is complicated by the fact that he suffers from short-term memory loss. The film is unique in that it tells the story backwards, starting at the end and moving to the beginning scene by scene. The purpose of this narrative device is to let the viewer experience what the protagonist is going through. It may have seemed like a clever idea on paper, but it makes for a muddled and unsatisfying film. The plot is preposterous and there are too many loose ends. Nolan seems more interested in propagating a gimmick than in telling a compelling story. It's not bad, but it's really not worth the trouble. Pearce is good."

norse76,"Feb 1, 2005",10/10,"When I first heard about this film, I was curious. Playing with time, while not a completely original concept, could make a film feel gimmicky and artsy. I am happy to say that this is not the case with ""Memento"", a clever and twisted thriller that makes the audience sympathize with the lead character by giving them, in essence, the same lack of info that the protagonist has. By telling the story in the fashion that the writer and director have chosen, if you don't pay keen attention to every line and every character, the film will definitely lose it's impact. The final twist is a whopper that I never saw coming and yet I didn't feel at all cheated. On the contrary, I wanted to watch it again (which I did immediately) and see if I could pick up on clues (which there are in abundance). If you like movies that challenge you to think while you watch, give this one a try."
ninglucky,"May 21, 2022",10/10,"Great!! Movie, I love this so much.Ps. Carrie-anne moss is so beautiful and her role had so much surprised.Should rewatch more than one time and you will have more fun for this movie."
sfworthington,"Nov 23, 2020",9/10,"This is probably one of the most subtly effective cathartic movies ever made. Memento manages to completely swallow you into its protagonist's world whilst just straight up impressing you with how intelligently crafted it is. Memento throws you in straight away, giving you little information that you gradually get spoon fed through the 'hairpin structure' of the film (how Christopher Nolan describes the structure of this film). This approach just forces you to pay absolute attention which you aren't regressive about because there's nothing you want more than to just know.
This film is definitely more than a well executed high concept piece, its genuinely a brilliant mystery thriller riddled with suspense, that sends you down a path that you just can't turn back from. I feel weary writing this review because all I went into this film knowing was that it had some sort of brilliant twist and I feel like the less you know about Memento the better so do yourself a pleasure and avoid spoilers or in fact any information if you fancy giving this a watch."
santis,"Feb 9, 2002",8/10,"Who is the villain? Who is a friend? What will happen next? What did just happen a while ago? Many questions in a movie that unlike any other really explores the memory of a man who is lacking it. He wants to find the person who murdered his wife but with a memory that lasts no more than fifteen minutes it's a hard work.Excellent dialogues, good actors and the constant mind-bonglingly sense that no one seems to be what he or she claims to be makes this a real winner. Rent it, buy it, own it and go on a exploration into an absent mind. You won't regret it. Your memory is a terrible thing to waste."
JessicaBrandy,"Feb 19, 2002",N/A,"When I saw this movie, my boyfriend took me to see it without telling me a single thing about it, which is weird.  So, I go in and from the first few mins I'm confused.  But enthralled.  As soon as I got the concept, my eyes were PLASTERED to the screen.  It has been so long since I've seen a movie where the story is enough so that I don't have to say, ""and the cinematography helped"", or, ""the acting helped"".  I think that the Nolan brothers could have gotten monkeys to play the roles and used their camcorders to shoot and I still would have been walking away saying WOW (people tell me I'm a bit of an exaggerator, but you know what I mean). In a time where you cannot turn to a radio station without hearing some sort of sampling, a time where a trip to the movies is to see a remake of this old T.V. show or that old movie, or just plain old sequels, it was a breath of fresh air to see a movie with such a plot and such a way to tell it.  I give Memento 2 thumbs and 2 big toes way up!"
jeremiahfuentes-33790,"Feb 1, 2022",10/10,"Just recently, I have started to get into mind bending movies that take the traditional way of telling stories and putting them through a fascinating layout. My first movie I had chosen to watch was made by a very well known director, Christopher Nolan, which is Memento. The movie follows a man with short term memory loss on a journey to find his wife's murderer, but that is sure to be the least interesting thing about the film. What struck me the most when watching the film was it's non-linear narrative. The film is laid out going back and forth in a sequences of the present and past. Doing this allows for the creation of suspense and feeling of unknowingness within the reader. The movie constantly has twists and turns that come unexpected because of its narrative and always keep us on our toes throughout the duration of the film. The writing and performances of the film were perfectly executed and set for the tone and feel of the movie. The performances allows us to actually dive into the world of the movie and most importantly believe that the story is real. Guy Pearce's performance is quite indistinguishable from real life, he gives such a believable performance that makes the watcher actually believe he has short term memory. The writing did a phenomenal job in keeping with the tone of the film, with making no out of place comments or words said by the characters to be acted out. It correctly orientated the characters to what they would say and/or do. I highly recommend watching this movie because of how intriguing and interesting it is which is displayed through the structure, writing, and performances. If you are like me and want to be thrown into a movie that calls for your brain to work and trying to understand the movie even after it is done with the credits, then this movie is for you."
OneWithChihuahua,"Jun 10, 2022",6/10,"I know my opinion won't be popular, but after hearing the adoration for this film. I had to try it out. I've tried to watch this film a half a dozen times over the years. Never quite got thru it, until now.It's definitely not as convoluted as Tenet, but it's still a chore to watch. Before you begin to question my comprehensive abilities. I made sure I understood every plot point, idea, and twist. I even went as far as reading the entire plot to make sure I didn't miss a thing, and then I read it again. Maybe it's the high level of praise, but I just wasn't impressed.The final reveal didn't really blow me away. The payoff in Tenet was far better, but that film was an even bigger chore to watch. The Nolan's make great stuff, but they also go a little overboard sometimes. Inception, amazing. The Dark Knight, incredible. Memento, wake me up when it's over."
wlee08,"Dec 23, 2008",5/10,"I saw this movie around five years ago so you'll have to forgive me if you're a fan. The truth is I was not blown away by this 'diabolical thriller'. Sure it leaves you scratching your head but is that necessarily a good thing? It may be a 'super intelligent' movie but that does not necessarily make it good art. I remember the acting as being semi-wooden, the production values low, and the dialog sparse. Is it a confusing movie? Absolutely. Will it makexsense if you watch it a dozen times? Probably. But I still would not count this as one of the top 250 movies of all time. That said, my hat off to a truly original script"

It's a sheer feet of organization to see the way Nolan and company twisty, recursive thriller, and managed not to leave a dozen or more gaping potholes along the way.Just as I remembered, it still feels very much like an independent film; definitely a low budget one. But the viewer is not the worse for it. In fact, that's part of its charm.My advice is to s watch it when you have the time to pay attention . You won't enjoy it if you can't keep up with it."
geektacular,"Sep 20, 2002",8/10,"Man, this movie blew me away.  They took a totally new approach to storytelling here.  Straight through, then backwards from the end, while showing present time as the story progresses. This is one of those movies that you'll have to watch numerous times to make all of the connections. The cinematography simulates Leonard's short memory loss, it seems, as you are thrusted form scene to scene, mostly out of sequence.  The story is compelling and it keeps you guessing throughout the whole movie. Excellent!!"
those_who_dig,"Oct 9, 2015",8/10,"I've always had a problem with Christopher Nolan's films: I struggle to appreciate his characters. The incredible experiences in which Matthew McConaughey's Cooper ('Interstellar'), Leonardo DiCaprio's Cobb ('Inception') and Guy Pearce's Leonard ('Memento') find themselves often accentuate their inability to appear convincing, real, and therefore human. I understand that when a protagonist is designed with no short-term memory (as 'Memento''s is), painting a vivid narrative portrait of him is no easy task; knowing this didn't improve my experience of the film, though. Although I didn't relate to or care for Leonard or indeed any of the other characters of 'Memento', I still gave it a favourable rating, and this is why: The narrative style employed by Nolan in this film truly is something to behold, and it is imposed in a manner which prevents it from being arbitrary or superficial. I'll say no more, as interpreting and coming to terms with the storytelling of 'Memento' was quite rewarding, and I implore you not to check any synopses prior to viewing the film. Whilst the technical aspects of the title are great (I'm chiefly thinking of the editing), I repeat my point about not really being able to invest in the content of Nolan's world. Perhaps I'm a philistine for preferring other ""lost identity"" titles such as Denis Villeneuve's 'Enemy' and Brad Anderson's 'The Machinist', but Nolan certainly makes 'Memento' a unique experience."
bobjohndave,"Aug 6, 2002",N/A,"Let me start this off by saying ""Whoa! This movie is absolutely spectacular!"" ... After you watch it several times. I first heard of this movie from a friend in my Drama class. He was incredibly ecstatic about Memento. He rambled on about it for twenty minutes, giving praise to the creators of this masterpiece. I decided, being the quality film buff that I am, that I should check it out. This first time around, I found the plot to be cumbersome and hard to follow. I didn't want to brush it off as some sort of elaborate gimmick film just yet, so as soon as the ending credits rolled, I started the DVD over and watched it from the top again. The second time through, I was able to follow the complicated plot twists with better ease. I had this same problem with Pulp Fiction, but, as with Pulp Fiction, watching the movie twice helped to alleviate my worries.Memento drops you into the mind of a man named Leonard, who runs around playing detective while hot on the heels of John G., the man who he believes is one of the two men responsible for the rape and murder of his beloved wife. John G., who escaped from the crime scene unscathed, didn't leave empty handed. With him he took away Leonard's ability to make new memories. Now Leonard stumbles around in a world of delirium and uncertainty as he searches for the man who killed his wife. Without a short term memory and the ability to make new memories, Leonard is forced to rely on scattered notes written on paper, tatoo facts, and Poloroid pictures to make his life liveable. The life of John or Jack G.(Leonard's not sure of which name it is) now depends upon Leonards ""notes"". Sadly enough, Leonard isn't even aware of how long his wife has been dead. He doesn't even know if he'll remember that he has killed John G. after he finds him and kills him.Along the way Leonard meets Natalie, a bartender, and keeps bumping into a mysterious man named Teddy who claims to be Leonard's friend. These two are constantly pulling Leonard in different directions, which leads to an interesting question. Who should he trust? And a tattoo on Leonard's left hand reminds him to ""REMEMBER SAMMY JANKIS."", a man with the same short term memory problem as Leonard. What's the connection between Sammy and Leonard? Watch the movie to find out!Overall, this is a great film that is worthy of a lot of your time. And trust me, it's going to take a lot of your time to figure this movie out. The acting is wonderful, the cinematography works great with the memory loss angle, and the telling of the story in reverse breathes a fresh breath of air into the movie industry. Guy Pearce(Leonard) is at his best in this film, as is Joe Pantoliano(Teddy). Carrie-Anne Moss(Natalie) deserves an honorable mention as well. If you're looking for a movie that will keep you guessing to the final moments of the film, then look no further than Memento."
slendersteve,"Apr 15, 2024",10/10,"Alright, strap in for this wild ride of a movie analysis! We're diving into the world of a guy who wakes up with a bad case of amnesia and decides to turn his body into a walking, talking puzzle book. The premise is as intriguing as it is ridiculous, but hey, that's half the fun, right?Our protagonist, let's call him Leonard, starts off as your typical blank slate. He wakes up in a dingy motel room, no memory of who he is or how he got there. Classic amnesia setup, right? But here's the twist: instead of relying on traditional methods to piece together his past, Leonard decides to get creative. He starts tattooing cryptic clues all over his body, each one leading him closer to unraveling the mystery of his identity.Now, let's talk about the execution. The filmmakers really went all out with the visuals here. Leonard's tattoos are like a work of art, each one a masterpiece of intricate design and hidden meaning. From symbols to snippets of cryptic text, every inch of his body tells a story. And as Leonard follows the clues, we're treated to some truly mind-bending twists and turns that keep us guessing until the very end.But of course, no movie is without its flaws, and this one is no exception. For starters, the pacing can be a bit wonky at times. We'll be cruising along at a nice clip, following Leonard on his tattooed treasure hunt, and then suddenly, we hit a speed bump. The action slows to a crawl, and we're left twiddling our thumbs until something interesting happens again.Speaking of which, let's talk about the characters. While Leonard is a compelling enough protagonist, the supporting cast leaves something to be desired. We've got the obligatory love interest who's about as interesting as a soggy cardboard box, and the villain who's so one-dimensional he might as well be twirling his mustache and cackling maniacally. It's a shame, really, because with a bit more depth and development, these characters could have added some real emotional weight to the story.But despite its flaws, ""Inked"" is still a rollicking good time from start to finish. It's a high-concept thriller with a unique twist, and even if it doesn't always stick the landing, you can't help but admire the sheer audacity of it all. So grab some popcorn, settle in, and get ready to go on a wild ride with Leonard and his tattooed trail of breadcrumbs. Who knows? You might just uncover a mystery or two along the way."
Mivas_Greece,"Dec 13, 2020",6/10,"Crime movie. One of Nolan's first films, but not one of his best. It has a common characteristic of his movies, time, and its taming. Two burglars break into the protagonist's house in order to rape and kill his wife, unaware that he is also there. Eventually he wakes up and trying to save his wife receives a severe hit to the head. This hit leaves permanent damage to a part of the brain so that it can not store newer memories in the long term, and can only remember current moments in the short term. However, he does his best to gather information with notes everywhere, photos, and even tattoos to investigate the crime and find the criminals. A rather simple scenario, without action or suspense, with only a few actors and seemingly low cost, but the plot was presented backwards to the people. Starting from the end of the plot until it reaches an earlier point where everything is explained, and which obviously because the protagonist does not remember, he does not know what things have happened and what he has done after the accident. All the scenes are presented in reverse order, which is unfortunately confusing and tedious for the viewers. Eventually, although up to a point some suspects appear, in the end the film changes all data completely, with a plot twist. It is worth a watch but it is not one of Nolan's best films"
Ashwani-Kumar-Abhinandan,"Oct 7, 2025",8/10,"MEMENTO (2000) is one of the most intricate and mind-bending films I've ever seen, surpassing the complexity of other Nolan movies.The acting is phenomenal, with Guy Pearce delivering an absolutely stellar performance. His expressions, intensity, and overall portrayal are top-notch.The direction and writing are nothing short of brilliant. Christopher Nolan's vision and Jonathan Nolan's contribution to the screenplay create a gripping and innovative narrative.The storyline itself is compelling, but its unique, non-linear presentation is what makes Memento truly exceptional.In 2000, this level of narrative complexity is remarkably impressive and ahead of its time.While the movie may seem daunting, it's not impossible to follow. Revisiting a few scenes can clarify the plot.Unlike typical fiction where a protagonist battles a clear antagonist, Memento intriguingly lacks a traditional villain, adding to its originality. At last I just want to say; ""What did I just watch?""Overall, if you're craving a bold, complex, and mind-blowing cinematic experience, Memento is a must-watch. It's a masterpiece that challenges and captivates in equal measure."
silvertn,"Jul 3, 2002",10/10,"Ordering any ""Top Five"" list is a difficult call.  At such heights, it borders on presumptuous to assume that one can actually distinguish Greatness from Greatness.  It's a bit like the Seven Human Intelligences. How do you measure one kind of genius against another?  Each is unique and unparalleled.  Memento is in that club; somewhere very near the top."
stephen.murtagh,"Oct 27, 2000",10/10,A great film that requires the viewer to stay alert.  It is a shame that my city has over 200 cinema screens and this is having a limited 2 week run on only one.  Hopefully DVD and VHS will allow y'all to see this great little flick.
verydopeguy,"Mar 6, 2022",9/10,Amazing Storyline! Great acting and filled with suspense. I watch the movie with my mum. I am 22 and she is 46. We both enjoyed the plot twist and the way the scenes were made. Very good transitions. Great work!
lumpynose,"Nov 5, 2002",9/10,"Like Kristina says, don't read the other comments here; they'll tell you too much.The other important thing that I think a lot of people don't realize is that there are no complete solutions to what happened in the movie.  If you watch the dvd there's an interview with the director and he points out that his goal was to put the viewer in Leonard's shoes.  A very big part of being in Leonard's shoes is being confused, lost, and not having control of what's going on.At the conclusion of the movie you'll feel confused and lost as well; don't take that personally, just consider how effectively the director did the job of making you feel that way.  And how you won't be able to stop thinking about the movie for quite awhile.Don't try to solve all of the questions you're left with; many are meant to not have solutions."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 26, 2023",6/10,"There have been several Hollywood films about loss of memory and patients suffering from amnesia. It was actually an overworked device for several years in order to develop a character with some type of motivation we do not know about. For the most part, it worked in several films , and failed in a few. In this one, it succeeds because of the sequence of events we are shown in flashback. Ask anyone over 75, and they will all tell you the same thing; where did I put my keys? Where did I put my credit card? Where was that pen I had yesterday? Short-term memory loss is not a big deal for them (or me), but it is a big deal when there are capital crimes involved. That is what makes the film interesting."
yellowelise,"Jan 21, 2005",10/10,"The film begins where it should end? and works it's way backwards to the beginning. Work that out.I am deliberately not telling much of the story here it really should be seen without prior knowledge for best effect. Suffice to say the film plays backwards in snapshots of time and is the story of a man (leonard) who can not make new memories. It is filmed from Leonards viewpoint I can only say go get a copy and enjoy.Nothing is certain, nothing is clear. It is a highly entertaining brain teaser that will have you thinking and talking about the film long after the normal memories (no pun intended) of an excellent film have left your head."
Notraxxs,"May 31, 2001",6/10,"Memento hangs on the shelf somewhere between The Usual Suspects and Being John Malkovich.  The pacing, the timing, and the feel of the movie is unlike anything I've seen before.  Memento is a one way trip into a void of memories you wont soon forget.  But when it's all done and the credits are rolling, I couldn't help but wonder ""Whats the point?"""
samuelmiller,"Oct 13, 2002",3/10,"I'd heard a lot of great things about this film before going out to rent it.  But once I did, I must say I was not extremely thrilled with it as the rest of the world seems to be.It is a brilliant and creative idea of how to make a movie (backward revealing of pieces of the story with every new scene) but unless I missed something, I believe that this is all this film had to offer. The acting was good, the story was good, the movie was good... but I do not believe it should be rated the number 1 best indie film and number 10 best film of all time.  (As it is on IMDB while I write this review)I think it simply receives a lot of praise because it is a movie made in a way that no one has ever seen before.  A friend even told me that he thought it was an amazing movie--though he didn't quite totally understand it.  Maybe it is appealing because it is confusing and people view it as a ""smart"" film because they can't quite follow totally what it going on and they have to watch it over and over again.  Either way, I believe it has received much more acclaim than it deserves.  It has certainly won many awards for great editing and original screenplays, etc--which it has.  But a movie of the year--or of all time as some IMDB users are rating it--I totally disagree.Finally, It is indeed totally original in the way a story is told and presented, but it is certainly not the greatest movie of all time.  I was disappointed overall with this film.  I do not believe it is a must-see.I could film an entire movie by attaching a camera to a dogs back and having him film the action, then playing it on the big screen mirrored and upside-down during some scenes.  That would certainly be an original idea never seen by movie-goers before, but that doesn't mean it should be voted into a group with The Godfather or Citizen Kane.I'm not saying Memento is like watching an upside-down film from a dog's point of view... But I'm saying it's up there with the Godfather for reasons that it should NOT be."
enzle444,"Aug 4, 2002",10/10,"I rented Memento not knowing what to expect.  After viewing it, I was speechless.  The plot of the movie is impossible to describe in a few sentences - it is so much more than simply a murder mystery.  It is a movie unlike any I have ever seen; for instance, chronologically Memento begins at the end, and ends in the middle, while during the movie the plot jumps back and forth between the present and the past.  The central character of the movie, Leonard Shelby (played by Guy Pearce), is in every scene.  It is Pearce's depiction of a man uncapable of forming new memories ever since his wife's death that carries the whole movie.  By the end, we see that a lack of memory is perhaps the worst handicap anyone can have.  I highly recommend this movie to all viewers, but be warned - in order to truly appreciate this movie you have to be paying attention to every detail."
victorboiting,"Jul 25, 2022",9/10,"First you don't understand anything, you get into the movie without anything, the great acting and the insane story makes this movie just perfect. Christopher Nolan is like Mozart but as a Director."
sme_no_densetsu,"Mar 9, 2014",8/10,"Back in 2000, Christopher Nolan's name meant little to the average moviegoer. Long before blockbusters like ""The Dark Knight"" and ""Inception"", Nolan made his first big splash with an independent feature by the name of ""Memento"". Its inventive storytelling techniques breathed new life into the mystery genre, particularly the tired trope of a character suffering from amnesia.In Nolan's film, the protagonist, Leonard Shelby (Guy Pearce), is sort of an amnesiac in reverse. Injured while preventing a robbery that left his wife dead, Leonard's short-term memory has been seriously impaired but his long-term memory is intact. Intent on revenge, he must deal with this considerable handicap while hunting down his wife's murderer.The twist on the oft-used amnesia theme is only the beginning of the film's inventiveness, though. The narrative structure audaciously puts the viewer in the shoes of the protagonist by alternating between scenes proceeding both backward and forward in time. The forward-progressing scenes are mostly expository in nature while the backward-progressing scenes are more plot-oriented. The trick is that as the plot unfolds (in reverse) we're no more aware of the preceding events than the protagonist. While somewhat disorienting at first (which is partly the point), before long piecing together the mystery becomes second nature.The cast is uniformly capable but I don't know if I'd necessarily single anyone out. Guy Pearce perhaps deserves the most credit for convincingly playing Leonard, which is easily the most challenging part in the picture.As far as the film's technical aspects go, I feel that they are also ably handled but not truly exceptional on their own. I find it unsurprising that the film's two Oscar nominations came for editing and original screenplay since these are the two elements most responsible for the film's uniqueness.Regardless of the film's perceived strengths, I can say for certain that ""Memento"" isn't for everyone. You definitely need to pay attention in order to make sense of the plot and, even then, you may find the narrative structure a little too disorienting. Add to that the fact that the ending is subject to interpretation and you have elements that some viewers are liable to regard in an unfavourable light. Thus, those who count on a linear narrative with a pat resolution should avoid this movie at all costs but for anyone else it ought to provide a unique viewing experience. Personally, I think that Nolan and company did a remarkable job of delivering on this ambitious concept, particularly given the low budget."
JackRJosie,"May 5, 2024",9/10,Can't believe it's taken me this long to see this film. I was always daunted by its concept- watching a movie happening backwards did NOT sound enjoyable... but holy cow what an interesting suspenseful experience it was! I felt like I was putting together a puzzle the whole time. A really brilliant thrilling puzzle with twists and turns! A truly innovative creative film pulled off perfectly.Great performances. Great production design. Great writing. Just a perfectly simply done execution of an overly complex film. One of my favorite Christopher Nolan flicks!Brilliant stuff!Would be interested to see someone edit the film in chronological order.
marvelous-marv,"Apr 6, 2002",9/10,"This film is for those who like mysteries, or are in school to learn how to make a good film script, or who are at least of average intelligence.  The lower life forms, such as NASCAR/Wrestling fans and bowlers need not apply --- go see The Flintstones, Part 8 in 3D.I have never had the pleasure of watching a film which progressed completely backwards in time & frame sequence.  You could literally watch this film from the last scene to the first and it would make sense, maybe even more sense, except of course that you would watch the true ending first and spoil it for yourself.  What's really cool is that there's a slight narrative story within the story that is moving forward --- it's really ingenious.This is a classic in the making; completely original in all aspects.  This is something that I'm sure Hitchcock would have liked to do if he or anybody had thought of it before.  There are plot holes, but incredibly, you don't notice them badly and they don't have to be resolved to enjoy the film.  The script even mentions at least one, and you have to stop and think for a moment to find the others --- if Leonard can make no new memories, what good is a revenge killing if he won't remember the satisfaction of it, or even if he has even exacted revenge already --- in fact, what good is doing anything other than just existing and waiting for a cure, but then you wouldn't have a movie, eh?  These questions were posed by the story which inspired the film and of course were omitted for sake of argument and they do not spoil the continuity one bit.The introduction of certain elements of the plot are not mentioned and left up to the viewer to decipher, and another big hole --- if Leonard can't remember anything, how does he remember how to drive a car, how does he even know that the Polaroids he takes are in his pocket, and how does he know about anything he has done more than 30 minutes ago which are essential to functioning in life in general?  There are also elements of certain characters that fail to resolve themselves, but you can live with them as well --- what you get in return is a heckuva neo-Noir flick that deserves your attention.If you will suspend belief as you should when you see any film and manage to hold on for the first 30 minutes until the plot thickens, you will get an incredible payoff.  In fact, this will be a film that you will want to watch again the very moment it ends to take stock of what just happened and the time frames and appreciate the mastery of the plot & screenplay fully and even discuss what you just saw with someone, as you may have a time figuring out what you just saw!  The filmmakers left a little of the story in your hands to allow you to decide what you just saw, but not so much (like ""K-PAX"") that you feel like you were left with an incomplete storyline.Thumbs straight up on this one, and you MUST get the DVD version to really appreciate this film."
erin_00,"May 29, 2003",N/A,"Who can honestly say how good their memory is? I know I can't, which is what I loved about Memento.Premise: A young, former insurance investigator is searching for the men who raped and murdered his wife.Here's the snag though. He has no short term memory and thus can't make new memories. People he's met and places he been vanish in a blink after 20 or so minutes. He has to constantly remind people of who he is, tells the same story of Sammy Jenkis over and over again, doesn't like to talk on the phone (he likes to look people in the face when he talks to them), takes photos and jots down who or what they are, has tattoo's all over his body as clues to finding his wife's rapist and killer. I could go on, but you get the point. It's a remarkably interesting structure to be taken through.Remember I said I couldn't rely on my memory a great deal and how that's what I loved about Memento? That's what made the film so incredible was the premise that memory is not 100% reliable. I loved being taken on a ride during this movie where I was confused as hell, lol. It was so much fun to have to force my brain to work harder at thinking about what was going on in this film. I left the theatre baffled as to what and how things had happened, but at the same time I couldn't stop thinking about the film.The acting in this film is beyond superb. The editing and photography is even better. The best part: the film starts at the end and works it way to a middle point. Noticed I didn't say beginning? That's because when the film comes to it's end you really don't know if it's the beginning since you don't know what Leonard (Guy Pierce) did before arriving at an isolated place. This film can really be seen as remniscent of the film style of Film Noir. It uses black and white scenes to give that off as well as the characters in the film constantly sucking Leonard further down into this world where he has no idea who and what to believe, including himself and the things he's done. Not only that but all the characters, yes even Leonard who is our protagonist, has a dark side of human nature to them. And that's what Film Noir is, exposing the dark side of human nature. The film has such a great Psychological deepness and by all means breaks the conventional art that goes into filmmaking. It really was a shame this film wasn't nominated for best picture. It greatly deserved that award and Nolan greatly deserved best director."
R3ason,"Oct 1, 2023",6/10,"The movie tells the story in a reversed order, which confuses people and keeps building suspense. It was fun to watch, but the story was not that worthy.The story is mediocre, which is about manipulation of a man that lost his short-term memory. Actually this seems a little unfair, because the writer decides when the protagonist starts forgetting things. So I won't say this movie has a good writing. Good writing shows consistency, which means the concept that makes up the movie should be taken through invariably. The Nolans did very well in The Prestige and Inception, but just no this one.However, the narration is innovative in a certain way: the confusion was just enough to drive me watching instead of forbidding me to undertand the plot.In recent years, they did Tenet which was not so well-received. That movie has a learning curve in its narration to make sure people following, but it tells a boring time-tralvel story, while the time-travel part is quite fancy. I think Tenet made the same mistake in this movie: they try to catch people's eyes with narration instead of solid plot."
piccostefano,"Mar 2, 2025",9/10,"Memento is an intense, mind-bending thriller that pulls you into its fragmented story and never lets go. The way it unravels in reverse isn't just a cool trick-it puts you right in Leonard's shoes, making every moment feel disorienting yet gripping.The tension is constant, and Guy Pearce delivers an incredible performance, making Leonard's struggle feel raw and real. The film keeps you guessing, twisting your perception of what's true, who to trust, and whether you're even seeing things the right way. Every detail matters, and the more you pay attention, the more rewarding it gets.What really makes Memento stand out is how it sticks with you. Even after the credits roll, you'll keep thinking about it, questioning the pieces, and maybe even wanting to rewatch it to catch things you missed. It's complex but never confusing, making it one of those rare thrillers that feels just as smart as it is entertaining.If you like psychological stories that challenge the way you think, this one's a must-watch."
svetaaniston,"Dec 24, 2004",6/10,"This movie is actually just a regular thriller: you expect to be thrilled, to have a suspenseful movie, full of twists and plots, and you get it. It's nothing more and nothing less. Yes, the plot and the way it's told (backwards) is clever, but hey, so was 'the butler did it' once. Face it: ALL plots in thrillers are clever in some way or another. That's no reason to call the movie brilliant. It takes more than that. A brilliant movie is a movie that tells you something about the world, about people, about yourself. This movie just tells you a nice story. It's well-made, well-acted, and well-thought-out. Although some stuff is really too hard to believe. But it doesn't matter as long as you're just expecting a solid ride, not a life-changing experience. By the way, there have been many movies and books which are told backwards. This movie is nothing new in this respect.OT: For example, read the book 'Time's Arrow' by Martin Amis. It's a story about WWII told backwards. The good thing there is that it gives you new insights about history of events and of how people thought during the war."
