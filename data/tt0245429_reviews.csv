gogoschka-1,"Dec 26, 2013",10/10,"Personally, I've never seen anything as original in an animated film as in this deeply mythical fairytale. What a surreal idea for a movie! It's hard to find an adequate description (because I also don't want to spoil this in the slightest way) but this film has a sense of ""otherness"" to it - for lack of a better word - like none I've ever seen. And the strange, mythical nature of this film - apart from the amazing artwork - is probably one of the main reasons for its appeal to me.Maybe the themes of the story don't feel quite as strange to an eastern audience because they fit to a certain degree with some eastern/Asian mythologies - to me, this beautiful piece of wonder was something new. And a profoundly moving experience.Outstanding animation; funny, weird, scary and touching at the same time, this unique work of art is one I can't recommend enough. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
shanebuckland,"Nov 4, 2002",10/10,"There is simply no denying that Miyazaki is the Godfather of Japanese Animation, time and time again delivering works of such incredible beauty, such stunning visual and sensory delights, such mastery of storytelling, that one can only be left speechless. Overwhelmed. Intoxicated with wonder. Such is the magic of Spirited Away.Much like Miyazaki's previous feature Princess Mononoke, Spirited Away is an epic fantasy that deserves no better medium than the stunning animation work of Studio Ghibli. This multiple award-winning masterpiece has grown to become the largest grossing film in Japanese history, and rightly so. From the moment our child heroine Chihiro enters the bath houses we are literally bombarded with an overwhelming sense of detail and rich, lavish colours rarely - if ever - seen in Western animation. Scenes such as Chihiro running through the field of flowers, the marvellous landscapes seen from the train, Haku and Chihiro soaring the skies above, and Chihiro running across the pipe to climb the walls of the bath house are nothing short of breathtaking, and undoubtably some of the most lavish animation ever to hit the screen.The world of Spirited Away is bustling with life; unique, quirky, instantly lovable creatures jostling about their daily activities and tasks in the bath houses, dancing across the screen like leaves caught in a playful summer breeze. The inventiveness of Miyazaki's character designs is wonderful to behold, in fact not since classic tales like Lewis Carroll's Alice In Wonderland and The Neverending Story have we been able to fall hopelessly in love with such original, quirky, magical, and fantastical characters. The viewer is plunged headfirst into another world for nearly two hours and one cannot help but be completely and utterly captivated.The music and original score is stunningly beautiful, the original Japanese language track of such high quality that one wonders why someone could insult the work by producing a dub track at all. With a plot differing in its complexity on so many levels, from the basic storyline to the omnipresent universal themes, to the riddling of Japanese history and fable throughout, children and adults alike will be mesmerised from start to end. A magical, awe-inspiring, tearful, laughter-filled, heartfelt journey through a land of sweeping fantasy and dreams. Prepare to be Spirited Away......"
Balibari,"Oct 18, 2004",9/10,"Last year I saw Spirited Away on it's UK release. I've never been a particular fan of anime, and it didn't really occur to me that I was watching a foreign language film dubbed into English (or 'American'). I can't imagine seeing a live action foreign language film dubbed into another language, but hey, this is a kids cartoon, what does it matter? Up to a point it didn't, because I loved the film. I enjoyed it so much I set about digging up the Studio Ghibli/Miyazaki back catalogue, in the process Sprited Away was filed away as one of the lesser Ghibli's - still great, but compared to Laputa, Grave of the Fireflies and a few others, it seemed a little weak.BUT... I recently re-watched it on DVD with the subtitles and found the difference unbelievable. The film came alive like the other Miyazaki's I've seen. It seemed infinitely more layered, detailed, intelligent and witty than I remembered. Could it be that retaining the intended performances (even if the words are unintelligible) can make that much difference? Maybe the dub was just poorly done? Or was it just because I was now versed in the language of Ghibli? As a little experiment I decided to re-watch some of the film with both the English subtitles and English language dub in order to compare, I ended watching the whole thing out of morbid fascination. It's simply amazing what a difference there is. Entire scenes change. It's not just that subtle emphasis is shifted or the same points are made in a different manner - in the dub, the subject of whole conversations and scenes are changed, and often to some flat and uninteresting hokum. Relationships between characters are changed, their motivations and personalities are changed, the difference is shocking.I appreciate western, and particularly American audiences can be put off by subtitles. And cinemas are less likely to show the film anyway. It's pointless to be all righteous when, fundamentally, you just want people to see the film. Unless they do, this treasure trove will remain undiscovered, and maybe finding it will encourage people to conquer the 'subtitle demon' (as Miyazaki might call him). But the problem is the quality of these dubs, and the liberties taken with the source material. Of course, without speaking Japanese, who can say it's not the subtitles that are way off? They're probably written by westerners too. But the dub just stinks of Disneyfication. Saturday morning generic nonsense. The challenging, uncompromising and emotionally ambitious nature of the film is severely watered down.A fair question might be, 'if it's so bad why was it so successful?' The success is evidence of the films staggering quality. Even so, it hardly challenged whatever Jerry Bruckheimer movie was showing at the time. In Japan it's the biggest grossing film in history. 'Go figure,' as Chihiro wouldn't say."
Le-Samourai,"Jul 20, 2004",N/A,"'Spirited Away' is the first Miyazaki I have seen, but from this stupendous film I can tell he is a master storyteller. A hallmark of a good storyteller is making the audience empathise or pull them into the shoes of the central character. Miyazaki does this brilliantly in 'Spirited Away'. During the first fifteen minutes we have no idea what is going on. Neither does the main character Chihiro. We discover the world as Chihiro does and it's truly amazing to watch. But Miyazaki doesn't seem to treat this world as something amazing. The world is filmed just like our workaday world would. The inhabitants of the world go about their daily business as usual as full with apathy as us normal folks. Places and buildings are not greeted by towering establishing shots and majestic music. The fact that this place is amazing doesn't seem to concern Miyazaki.What do however, are the characters. Miyazaki lingers upon the characters as if they were actors. He infixes his animated actors with such subtleties that I have never seen, even from animation giants Pixar. Twenty minutes into this film and I completely forgot these were animated characters; I started to care for them like they were living and breathing. Miyazaki treats the modest achievements of Chihiro with unashamed bombast. The uplifting scene where she cleanses the River God is accompanied by stirring music and is as exciting as watching gladiatorial combatants fight. Of course, by giving the audience developed characters to care about, the action and conflicts will always be more exciting, terrifying and uplifting than normal, generic action scenes.Through Chihiro, Miyazaki is clearly (but non-patronisingly) talking to youth of Japan. There's a certain sense of revile about the youth of Japan at the moment. Many people consider them to be ill-mannered and baring no respect for their elders or their forefathers. They are simply bi-products of their material world and consumerism. 'Spirited Away' taps into this. At the start Chihiro is a selfish, spoiled, whiny brat. But as she plunges deeper into the spirit world, she becomes more independent, more assured, more respectful and learns some manners. No Face, a black figure with a white mask, is the catalyst behind Chihiro's transformation. Once he is let into the bathhouse, we are no longer tourists  the story propels forth. Watching No Face prey on the greed of the workers is a terrifying delight. The three main characters in Miyazaki's youth allegory are Chihiro, No Face and Bô. All of these characters are disconnected with their world. They are lonely, misunderstood and largely ignored. But when they go on their journey together, they united and become stronger individuals.Miyazaki also talks about the ecology of Japan. What was once a beautiful; grassland has now turned into the Asian New York. That The Last Samurai had to be filmed in New Zealand to get a turn of the century Japanese look speaks volumes. The River God sequence is an unsubtle but unpretentious commentary on pollution. While these two themes are very much current in Japan, they are also universal themes  which makes 'Spirited Away' a universal story that most of us can connect with. I'm willing to bet everyone reading this has at some time seen bicycles lying on a lake bed or have had a child talk to them disrespectfully. Sure these themes aren't advanced philosophy. They are everyday issues told in an inventive, fun way.The animation is wonderful, if not as smooth as Disney's works  but there's something superior to that. 'Spirited Away's imperfect, but detailed world is far more fascinating than the perfected blandest of Disney's latest offerings. The animators successfully balanced the tight-rope between not-enough animation on characters and too much animation on characters. No Ralph Balski ADD antics here! The film is full of vivid images  both beautiful and horrifying. The line between those two extremes is crossed over seamlessly. From Chihiro and Haku running through an opening flower field to Haku's dragon snarling with a bloody mouth, both extremes seem to belong in the film. It's also excellently done with the characters. Kamaji can be seen as a scary, daunting figure at the beginning, but soon he seamlessly changes into a humble, wise figure. Yubaba also seems to be able to turn from kind to witch with the snap of a finger.The sound on the film was expertly done. The sounds perfectly match the on screen actions and objects. My sub woofer got a wonderful workout when Haku swoops Chihiro past the bridge at the beginning. And while I don't speak Japanese, I think the voice actors did a wonderful job of conveying their personality and emotions true their voice. Joe Hisaishi's music is sublime, definitely one of my favourite scores. His main piano theme is simple and evocative. His thunderous action music hits the viewers on the chest like a hammer. Like all great scores it heightens the greatness of a scene about three times. The score, unlike many American composers', is unobtrusive. It plays excellently with the scenes, but never overbears them. A lot of the time the it is barely noticeable, a sole piano plays softly in the background evoking a dreamlike/lullaby quality.'Spirited Away' is a simply a modern masterpiece, easily one of the Top 10 films of the new millennium. It works on a multitude of levels; a social commentary on Japan, a homage to ancient Japanese/Russian mythology, a moral film for both children and adults. But most importantly, it is a simple story brilliantly told by a great filmmaker who appears to be at the top of his game. 'Spirited Away' works much like a relaxing journey. Pop in the DVD; leave this world for two hours and when you will be almost certainly enriched and ready to take the trip again."
0U,"Feb 15, 2020",10/10,"Despite an overlong run time, Spirited Away is a visually stunning film filled with some of the most imaginative characters I've ever seen. In addition to the visuals, the music is beautiful, and the story has something for audience members of all ages."
supertom-3,"Apr 2, 2004",10/10,"This is a wonderfully imaginative and fantastical children's fantasy. It is easy to see why it was perhaps the critical hit of 2002. The film is glorious to look at. It is a testament to old fashioned animation techniques that seem to be resigned to foreign animations. Of course there is some use of computer imagery for certain shots but they blend seamlessly and the overall artistry involved is superlative.This is the first Hayao Miyazaki film I have seen and I will certainly watch his others. The story plays on many elements successful with kids films, that transport you back to your own childhood and also allows the young audience to connect with the themes in the movie too. The story centres around Chihiro, a young girl about to move into a new place and who feels insecure about the new environment she will be living in. These fears become a part of her encounter with a strange abandoned amusement park that she and her parents find when they reach a dead end in their car. At the park they find that their is a stall that is seemingly open, with glorious displays of mouth watering food. There are no people about but Chihiros parents decide to gorge themselves on this bounty and pay later. As Chihioro explores she comes across a strange boy who warns her to get out before dark. It is too late however, because as night falls, ghosts are awakened, and then by the time she gets back to her parents they are turned into pigs. She then finds that the route she came from is gone and she is now trapped in this place, her only allie being the boy she met earlier. She is told to get a job at the centre piece of the park, a bath house run by Yubaba, an evil power mad witch. This is a bath house for the spirits and Chihiro has to find a job there before she is found and turned into an animal herself, then unable to save her parents.The story is imaginative and the characters and animations endlessly unique and strange. This is just so much more creative than Hollywood. The characters are likeable and we become engrossed with Chihiros adventures inside this bathhouse, and the characters she comes into contact with as she tries to get her parents back as humans and whilst trying to get back to the human world. What I also loved in this film is that the animation gives it a real sense of cinematography, the drawing makes the film stand out in a way that American animations rarely do. Another film I think of that looked really good was Bellville Rendezvous. Another great point in fact the best part of it, is the fantastic score. It really is uplifting and very original. This is just great film making. *****"
Nextwiggin,"Mar 28, 2006",10/10,"I have some advice to anyone that hasn't seen this movie or did not like it but is attempting to watch it again: do not look at this movie the same way you look at western movies. This movie is meant to be a fable, and thus is chock full of metaphor. In fact, since it is set in the spirit world, EVERYthing is a metaphor. I don't want to impose my own views as to what those metaphors may mean, but it is important to accept, in a sense, that this movie doesn't have a plot. At least, not in the conventional sense. It would be better viewed as an exploration. Of what, I'll let you decide. Watch the movie, try to figure out what all the characters mean, why some are portrayed in a more favorable light and others not. It is also important to remember that, unlike western art in general, many of this movie's metaphors and messages have more than one meaning. I get the sense from reading the posts of other people, as well as some reviews, that many people have trouble realizing/accepting this. But, in my opinion, it is essential to move past this to truly enjoy and understand the movie and its message. The implication of this is also that it is impossible to fully understand the movie in just one viewing (or two, or many more). Like a painting, we are meant to look at this movie from different perspectives; close up and from far away and in different lights. All this is why I consider Spirited Away my favorite movie, and I hope that my advice will help some people see it in a different light. I don't claim to have all the necessary information to understand this movie, but rather I think I can help some people people who have trouble with this sort of movie and art enjoy it a bit more. So... have fun!"
sailvane-1,"Jan 12, 2005",10/10,"Actually I dislike his or her comments badly. If you didn't get it watch it again. This is not a piece to just entertain, the creator has put his own feeling and I believe life experience and the fear always buried in children's mind into it. It is a comely tale that express the creator's thoughts in some way, whilst shining as a attractive animation piece with so many details that you might have ignore if you were careless. It is a rich story and I can see the efforts creators put into it in many spots and frames.e.g. While Chihiro was walking towards the garden where Haku told her to meet him, she passed some stairs where she can see an island, there are some house on it, she stopped for it for a little while, that, represents her longing to human world, her own world, this kind of details can be ignored by many people but they don't mind putting it in to make the whole story richer, more truthful, full of power of humanity.Apart from that, did you ever notice that some ""camera language"" was used very well to tell the story in a more entertaining and better pace.e.g. When Kamaji was telling Chihiro how Haku turned up to this world before just like what she did, the ""camera"" panned to where the little rat(changed from the fat baby)was showing off to soots by putting his foot into the spell melted print while Kamaji's introduction about Haku's background is also getting across to the audience. This is just one of the details that shows how much story telling skills and rhythm control of plots.There're many other things like this, shouldn't be ignored if you want to make a nice comment, even though as an American viewer you might miss a lot of the story by lack of the culture background, but that's not the reason that you can comment it as anyway you want without even really READ the film.I am a visual effects person and film maker but I can't tell where the jerking of the footage and the stopping of character's movement are in the film. could Gazzer please enlighten us? As also a fan of Pixar I hope I don't have bias on either American animations or Japanese ones, but as a Chinese who might have some resistance towards Japanese products for national esteem or historic reason, I still admires Ghibli Studio's work. ""Spirited Away"" is a masterpiece of elegant picture and touching story, if Gazzer-2 knows what that means.""Ice Age"" was a pretty cute one of Fox productions, but not good enough to compete with ""Spirited Away"" I'm afraid. And I'd laugh at the opinion that the story of ""Ice Age"" is much simpler hence Oscar committee didn't recognise it, actually I believe ""Spirited Away"" was beautifully hand-painted frame by frame while ""Ice Age"" had a giant crew in 3d animation and visual effects. I'm afraid Ice Age was the much more complicated one."
planktonrules,"Jun 11, 2007",9/10,"I have seen many international films over the years and quite a few of these were Japanese. In addition, unlike many parents, I have seen a lot of anime that my kids have watched so at least I have some familiarity with the medium. Yet, with my background I still felt pretty confused and baffled by the strangeness of this movie. Now this isn't to say I didn't like it, but so many times I just couldn't understand exactly what was happening. Interestingly, when I saw the film again, I understood it much better and appreciated it much more. And this may be exactly how you might want to approach the film unless you already are a die-hard anime fan. See it, but be willing to see it without trying to think out the odd plot too much or even try seeing it several times. I know that each time I did, the film became more and more enjoyable and I began to notice so many cultural references. Now, several years after I first saw it in the theater, I have seen a lot more Japanese anime and films and it's practically second-nature to follow the film. So, for adults and those unfamiliar with the medium, this movie might take a bit of effort to fully enjoy, though with more and more children being familiar with and loving anime, it's very likely your kids will love it and will then be able to explain it to you!! As for the film, the animation is the best I have seen in any Miyazaki film, the story deep and fascinating and it's full of cute and endearing little touches that make the movie magical. See this with an open mind, please."
kellokchu,"Jun 27, 2019",10/10,One of the best movies I've ever watched and is still stuck with me til this day.
Morejambo54,"Dec 29, 2020",7/10,"I enjoyed this movie but more towards the end. The first half of the movie was very odd, which is one of the main reasons I kept watching as I wanted to understand it but that didn't really happen. Not enough was explained and it felt like a mix of random events yet there was an actual story. Im struggling to come up with a reason of why no-face was even in the movie, he was just there. This movie isn't bad by any means, it's just lacking somethings in my opinion. I also didn't. Really feel in touch with any of the characters as no room was left for them to develop. The wired and wacky characters made the film very unique and interesting, the film is visually beautiful as well, I would personally want more depth.It is a good movie with a lot of potential. 7/10"
rtsdynamite,"Jul 28, 2022",8/10,"Spirited Away contains a great cluster of creativity. The characters and ideas are mostly original and the core design which is the main character's (Chihiro) coming of age tale, completes with satisfaction. Yet the film feels familiar. It shares the same magic that Disney's older pieces contain and it is executed with a Japanese approach which does make it different but it has the same purpose. Which is to simply encourage younger audiences into being brave and so on.That cluster of creativity also becomes a bit mindless when random things keep happening, there is absolutely no consistency with anything. Details are introduced and have next to no meaning, other than expanding the lore. The mysteries that are wrapped up in the opening scenes unwrap cluttered and without defining details. Im not completely in the directors head and i feel as if some things just happened for the fun of it. I was expecting a layered story with the exceptionally high rating, with every detail having depth and meaning. Without spoiling the film, greed is frowned upon and im sure that capitalism is questioned, with the abandoned old themepark reflecting the loss of the old era. Little things such as Bo having to become small to become a bigger and better being, with him able to stand as a result are things to take away from the film.I do however, simply believe that the West has blown this movie above its true level. Yes it is original, yes it has qualities but apart from its unique characters 'Spirited Away' is not a special film for me. Perhaps i am being too critical or perhaps i am just disregarding the 2001 release date which may bring some exceptional credit to it, of which i am not aware. I have seen cartoon films before and i have seen anime's, yes this is a perfect combination of the 2 for children. I really enjoyed some of the characters but felt the story came short but perhaps i have set the bar too high in a film made for children. 8/10."
anirudhajith,"Oct 20, 2018",6/10,"Undeniably an amazing art-style and a rich, immersive background score. Particularly so for a movie released in 2001.
However, I for one did not ""get"" the story. I feel like this movie is art which I have not understood. The plot left me feeling confused and unsatisfied."
orialon24,"Apr 25, 2020",4/10,Heard from a lot of people I should watch this movie and thought I'd like it but just couldn't get into it... forced myself to finish it and thought it's pretty boring
Foxbarking,"May 2, 2005",10/10,"This movie is an outstanding piece of artwork. I hadn't heard much about it when it was first released. Being a huge Oscar fan, I was surprised when it took home the award for best animated film. At that point, knew nothing about it.After reading a little more and seeing some commercials, I still wasn't sure whether or not I wanted to see this film. It looked so surreal in an ""Alice in Wonderland"" sort of way. I had never been a big fan of that film and didn't really want to relive such an idea. Mindbending films have never been my absolute favorites.I went to see ""Spirited Away"" with a friend who was into anime. He hadn't heard much about it either, but was interested in seeing it in the theater. Since it had won the Academy Award, I decided it was a good idea to give it a shot.I am so glad I did. Only a very few times in my life have a I seen a movie as brilliant as this. It stands alone with such masterpieces like ""Citizen Kane,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""The Godfather"" and any other classic piece of cinema in history.I won't go into too much detail, but I was spellbound from the opening credits until the closing ones. The story starts out so rough and scary, but becomes a work of happiness and beauty. To think that this movie almost didn't get made is a travesty. It will stand the test of time and go out as one of the greatest films ever made."
ehy2k,"May 25, 2004",10/10,"The art work alone is worthy of the engulfment one experiences when watching the big screen, making me wish I had seen it on the big screen.  That is, unless the major release in the US was the English language version.We ended up renting the DVD and watching it in English.  The sound, the voice of Chihiro in particular, grated our ears like nails on a chalk board. After watching it, we played around with the DVD and found the original Japanese soundtrack with English subtitles. Far more subtle and simply put, an AMAZING difference.So, I would suggest watching it in both languages.  English so that you can concentrate on the scenery (with the sound turned down low.  Really, the screeching and shouting in English is annoying). Then watch it in Japanese for the color and mood the dialog provides."
paul_mampilly,"Sep 27, 2003",10/10,"As the rest of the Western world was amazed by the throngs of CGI animation, and the inside Disney jokes, Japanese audiences were given a chance to see what real animation was like. This movie was the first foreign film which grossed over 200 million dollars before it came over the US shores. It had beaten Pixar's Ice Age and Disney's Lilo and Stitch to get Best Animated Feature. Yet with all these facts and figures shown to us, does this movie live up to its hype. In a one word answer, YES!However there is no point of handing out the superlatives to a movie, without explaining what the movie is all about. In a nutshell, the movie is about a ten year old girl who is travels to a strange yet enchanting world, after her parents were morphed into pigs. This change of shape was produced by the evil witch, Yubaba, an nasty sorceress who rules over this paralell universe. To avoid detection, the ten year old girl, Chihiro has to work for Yubaba in her bath house. This is where she meets all kind of strange and wonderful characters, like the half man half spider Kamaiji, the mysterious little boy, Haku and many other characters. Though Chihiro had met all these people, her only wish is to go home and turn her parents back to their normal human selves.Watching this movie, has made me wonder why is this feature shown in very small arthouse cinemas and it is on pirate DVDs, when it should be easily shown on the multiplex cinemas. This is a truly amazing movie, whereby the whole story, transports oneself to their earlier childhood. I know that happened to me. Also the movie's animation was totally amazing, in ways that Pixar and Dreamworks would just die for. A good example of this is the flower scene.In conclusion, everyone should watch this movie, whether young or old, japanese or any other nationality, because at the end of the day, this will show you emotions that any other animations will not give you the chance to show."
Juggertrout,"Jun 21, 2005",10/10,"Spirited Away is my favourite Hayao Miyazi movie. It's a departure from his previous films (all of them wonderful), in the sense that this film lacks the themes so common in his other work: humans vs nature, large scale battles being the prime examples. All for the better I say, as it allows him to create something truly unique and stunning. The story revolves around Chihiro, a young girl who, on the way to her new house, stumbles into an abandoned amusement park and is soon transported into a magical world of spirits, gods and human-frog hybrids.The animation is stunning. Miyazaki truly sees animation as an artform. Many stand out scenes contain no dialogue at all, and are merely animated images creating surreal effects: Chihiro in the lift with the Radish spirit, Chihiro running through the flowers, and the final train ride, where our young protagonist takes a mysterious train journey across a sea, with her spirit friend, No Face. Nothing much happens, it's just simple, colourful, oddly unsettling, and lingers long after the film ends.The characters are also perfect, and add to strange storyline. There's Kamaji, the multi limbed boiler room operator, Yubaba, the evil witch, and her massive baby child. No Face is a peculiar spirit who turns feral when Chihiro is not around, and finally, Haku, a boy spirit, who shares an emotional scene with Chihiro towards the end of the film.Colourful, imaginative, interesting, and emotional. Spirited Away is a film you'll want to see time and time again. Buy it."
TheLittleSongbird,"Apr 5, 2010",10/10,"I love Studio Ghibli, and Spirited Away is one of my favourite films from the studio. This is coming from someone who was delighted by Howl's Moving Castle, blown away by Princess Mononoke, emotionally devastated by Grave of the Fireflies and touched by the simplicity of The Cat Returns all but to name a few. Spirited Away is a mystical, charming and truly enchanting animated fantasy, even with the long length and some slow moments. The animation is absolutely stunning, both the hand drawn visuals and the CGI graphics give an ethereal charm to the film. The characters move more than convincingly and the colours are beautiful. The music is also outstanding, I loved the simplicity of the piano and the drama of the more dramatic parts. The story is a pleasure, I know people have complained of some loose ends, but it is an original, touching and charming one I feel. I also loved the characters. Chihiro, voiced with real enthusiasm by Daveigh Chase, is sulky to begin with, but she is also brave and resourceful, traits I like in young heroines. Lin is kind and sympathetic, and Susan Egan who was also in Porco Rosso was unusually sensitive as the character. Jason Marsden is charming as Haku, and Suzanne Pleshette is perfect as the grotesque Yubaba and as her sister Zeniba. Overall, I loved Spirited Away, it is really charming. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
jediknightcub,"Nov 8, 2002",7/10,"The word masterpiece is being thrown around a little bit too much on this one.While I found myself stunned by the visuals in Spirited Away (particularly a magnificently realized train ride across the sea), its lackluster story - little more than a rip-off of (or homage to) Alice In Wonderland - keeps this film from being a classic masterpiece.Some of the ideas were extraordinarily imaginative (the spirit bathhouse, Haku's transformation into a dragon, Yubaba's transformation into a bird, the boiler-room operator), others were just downright ridiculous (No-Face's regurgitation, the bouncing disembodied heads, the baby, an evil twin sister - what is this Days Of Our Lives?).This is not to say that I was expecting literal-minded filmmaking.  I was thoroughly impressed by the director's previous film, Princess Mononoke, but I felt its story was integral to its success (i.e. a hero's journey; the forces of human industrialization vs. nature and the need to co-exist peacefully).  The ""story"" in Spirited Away is much more simplistic (girl overcomes her fears) and, as a result, leaves little in the way of narrative thrust or suspense (especially for a 2 hour movie).  Princess Mononoke's story was epic and its running time and pace justified.  Spirited Away is merely serviceable in every way except its visual palette."
chilljay987,"Mar 24, 2006",10/10,"I cannot express how beautiful and just incredible this movie is. I haven't seen this masterpiece in anything but the dubbed English, even though many say it is incredible with subtitles or even just in Japenese. I can guarantee you that you will fall in love with this movie. Maybe not after the first time you see it, but maybe after the 2nd 3rd or 4th. Chihiro is a little girl who is moving. She is a drama queen in the car as her parents are driving her to her new home. Then her father gets lost and Chihiro and her parents wind up at a building in the woods.. they walk through the structure and enter a world of wonder with spirits and magical creatures. She overcomes many obstacles in this odd world and changes her attitude and perspective on things. I do have to admit that the first time I saw this movie, I had no idea what was going on. After a while I just stopped paying attention to the plot and just focused on the brilliant art of the movie. But after the second time watching it, I totally got the movie. It made me feel good about myself. And now every time I watch the movie, I see so many things I haven't seen before. I PROMISE you that you will not regret seeing this masterpiece."
andromeda314159,"Aug 3, 2023",7/10,"With all the rapturous reviews I've read about Spirited Away - written and directed by Hayao Miyazaki, animated by Studio Ghibli, a box-office giant not only in Japan but worldwide - I prepared to have my mind blown by it. And that's probably one of the problems I had going into it. Too high expectations ruined it for me. It's good, but I wasn't blown away.No doubt the animation is great, though I'm not a big fan of that humongous blob of waste walking around the hotel, it actually turned my stomach. I guess it's just not my type of story and characters. I didn't enjoy Alice in Wonderland that much either, which this story of a young girl who comes across a ghost town reminds me of. Maybe technically it is superior, but I didn't feel enough heart."
elpresidente-4,"Jun 15, 2020",5/10,"I've been hearing good things about this movie for years and finally decided to watch it, but I didn't quite understood it. There are things that I liked, like the expressive way the main character was drawn, the overall color palette and backgrounds, maybe some points for the original setting, but with that, I can't think of what else good to say. From all the things I've heard I expected the movie to be very emotional, yet I failed to notice such thing. I had seen the black character with the mask used in memes on the internet so much, that I expected he would play a really important part in the story, but in the end he was nothing special. The story really confused me, some elements didn't make much sense to me, and the ending was pretty rushed, like they ran out of money and had to complete the movie fast. I don't know, maybe I have to study Japanese philosophy and symbolism to understand what is happening. Don't get me wrong, I kinda enjoyed the movie, I just wish it made more sense. It sort of reminded me of the movie ""labyrinth"", but that movie has a very good structure and story, and you always know what is going on and why. In conclusion, I think the movie would be appreciated more by children."
minimeltheminx,"Oct 11, 2004",N/A,"I really enjoyed this film-everything about it glows and shines in a gentle luminosity. This film, if you have seen some of Miyazaki's other work, is quite light. The characters are beautifully and lovingly created and the colouring and setting of this film is absolutely superb. This is a beautiful little film and I can't wait for the next feature from Hayao Miyazaki-he is better than Walt Disney.Miyazaki blends the characters and the environment very well together, and I can see that this would be enjoyed for people at many different levels. Miyazaki enjoys creating female heroines and I was pleased that Chihiro lived up to the expression and beauty of her predecessors-like Nausicaa from the Valley of the Wind. This is beautiful and I would advise anyone to take a look at it's scope and serenity, along with it's fast paced plot and of course, the dreamlike settings that make it truly wonderful."
thewubbelupagus,"Mar 22, 2006",10/10,"I never thought I liked anime until recently. Prior to this, the only titles I had enjoyed were the Animatrix, and Ghost in the Shell. They play a lot of anime shows on cartoon network, and I've tried to get into them, but usually watch a minute or so, find them irritating, and easily turn to something else.I tuned into a showing of this film however, and was instantly captivated. Its so very unique and wonderful I simply could not turn it off. I couldn't even partake of my usual channel surfing for fear of missing a minute of its goodness when it came back from commercial! Although I think it loses some of its magic when Chihiro/Sen starts to get used to her new surroundings, it stays genuinely entertaining to the end. I would recommend this film to anyone as a good jumping off point for exploring Anime."
aethertuna,"Dec 28, 2024",10/10,"Personally, this is the best anime movie I've ever seen! The story is unreal! Spirited Away is a film that pulls you into a world unlike any other. From the moment Chihiro stumbles into the mysterious spirit realm, you're hooked by the incredible visuals and unique characters. Miyazaki creates a world that feels alive, where every detail-from the bustling bathhouse to the hauntingly quiet train ride-is packed with meaning and emotion.What makes Spirited Away so special is its heart. Beneath all the strange creatures and magical settings, it's really a story about growth, resilience, and finding strength in unexpected places. Chihiro's journey from a scared little girl to a brave, determined heroine feels real and inspiring.While the movie's pacing might feel slow at times, it gives you time to absorb the depth and beauty of this magical world. The quiet moments are just as powerful as the big ones, letting you reflect on the story's deeper themes about identity, responsibility, and the connections we share.The music, too, deserves a mention. Joe Hisaishi's score is breathtaking, perfectly capturing the film's mix of wonder, fear, and hope. It adds so much to the overall experience, making every scene even more memorable.Spirited Away is a must-watch for anyone who loves animation, fantasy, or just a good story with heart. It's a film that doesn't just entertain-it stays with you, making you think and feel long after the credits roll. An 10/10 for me, and absolutely worth your time. I AM IN LOVE WITH SPIRITED AWAY!"
pip-7,"May 3, 2005",10/10,"It is so ironically tragic that many great movies such as Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away are often overlooked by the public, suggesting that commercialism is the way of reflecting the possibility of achieving blockbuster status in the box-office, even as if most of these recycled products receive poor reviews (remember Shark Tale? It's horribly cliché but millions of viewers still watch it). Is it because of technology that drives its influence to the public without providing any necessity that is its substance? Or is it because Spirited Away is considered another ordinary 2D cartoon that should be suitable for little children and not the rest of us? Sadly, this is reality and we all see as it is right now (providing that we live in a topsy-turvy world with unfair paradoxes) but it doesn't mean that Miyazaki's masterpiece has a chance to change our reflections on life. In fact, there are doses of good reasons on why this movie is so special to us, aside from its family-friendly context.Hayao Miyazaki, who has directed many of the most acclaimed animated movies in animation history (under the banner of Studio Ghibli), has stated that Spirited Away is 'for the people who used to be ten years old and the people who are going to be ten years old'. Perhaps, he really knows how children see things in their own eyes, as he might use to face during his childhood times (that's why most of his movies feature flying ships/creatures, tons of imaginative elements derived from Asian/Western cultures, some preferences from classic fairy tales, etc.) Most importantly, Mr. Miyazaki uses this tagline as an essential plot device to show the innocence, the bizarre, the horror and the wondrous revelation that the main protagonist (Chihiro) sees, feels and experiences throughout her spiritual journey, a path that we all had crossed as children before the madness of the world overwhelms our innocence. Fortunately, movies like Spirited Away succeeds in regaining our former consciousness, pulling us into his imaginative world where our childhood memories have never died; they are merely hidden inside our hearts and Mr. Miyazaki is enable to reshape them with everything this movie has to offer.Instead of the cliché-ridden plots that mar state-of-the-art-animated films of today, Mr. Miyazaki refers to his personal experience in Japan as another plot device while maintaining the classic storytelling technique to create an entirely refreshing concept based on real-life situations. If you think Spirited Away features some of the most incomprehensibly bizarre characters you've never seen, fear not! Like all good movies, despite their oddity, they all are no different from us in terms of how they adapt to life and their functions to keep the company going. That also leads to the fact that Spirited Away is really not a good vs. evil show (like Star Wars); despite its scary images, powerful spells and evil-looking monsters, they are all surprisingly ordinary with mere characteristics of maids, bosses and customers. So don't expect a Darth Vader-like antagonist to cover the whole world with darkness while unleashing a large army of robotic troopers to destroy everything in their sights.The overall animation is simply breathtaking. Even as they are all hand-drawn, the characters' expressions and body postures are all wonderfully done in a very natural way, the same applies to these beautiful background settings painted painstakingly by some of Ghibli's most talented artists in Japan. Speaking of animation, when watching it up close and personal, it does bear some resemblance to Disney's Snow White as well as his classic movies (unlike the new, recycled Disney movies of the early 2000s) in terms of its cel-shaded look and the way most characters move and interact (strangely, though, Mr. Miyazaki is not a big fan of Disney. Ironically, Disney is the only company that understands his movies' significance to moviegoers around the world, so it serves as a distributor to Ghibli's animated movies in North America.). Unlike most current anime that requires CGI to excite the audience, Mr. Miyazaki fortunately decides not to rely much on fancy digital applications (there are some subtle CGI effects, which are cleverly implemented on certain parts of the movie).Disney, in its other matter, has done a good job in translating the movie's original Japanese context to its English counterpart without radically changing the flow and theme of its entire story, thanks to Pixar animator and executive producer John Lasseter (however, Disney's marketing power fails to attract more moviegoers). Despite the audience's varied reactions on English and Japanese tracks, in my opinion, I find both of them outstanding and seem to have a natural pattern to influence the mood of the movie. Once again, Joe Hisashi, the composer of many of Miyazaki's movies, has provided some of the finest and most memorable cues ever to bring grace to the screens (one of my personal favorite is a cue in which Haku finally remembers his original name, shedding its scales in the sky). Without these important audio elements, Spirited Away could have been another uninspiring, lifeless show.It is no doubt that Spirited Away has indeed changed the way we look at animated movies, similar to the way the original Star Wars trilogy, the first two Godfather movies and films by Steven Spielberg did. It is also true that whatever I write in this review, a single picture tells a thousand words; you still need to watch it with your own eyes, feel it as you are still a child and you will understand a thousand reasons why this movie should receive an Oscar for Best Animated Feature. However, like many artistic filmmakers, Mr. Miyazaki is not interested in such glamorous spotlights and moneymaking propaganda, as he continues to inspire newer generations with his latest waves of masterpieces, starting with Howl's Moving Castle.Thank you, Mr. Miyazaki for proving once again that childhood memories will forever endure within our hearts and souls until the end of time."
Aprigo,"Mar 3, 2006",10/10,"I have given movies 10 out 10 stars before, but this just crosses a completely new line into something even above 100% greatness; perfection. This may be the only film I have ever seen that is completely perfect, I would change absolutely nothing about it. The only other film that I would put over the top is, coincedentally, My Neighbor Totoro. The fact that the are made by the same company has nothing to do with it.Whenever I watch this movie, not only do I find things that I didn't notice the time before, but I feel a sense of having already seen certain things in it before, somewhere else. But I haven't - it is just the originality, and the new ideas that other movies will build on from this one. Everything is perfect. The illustrations are detailed, flowing, and mesmerizing. The musical score is dead-on, and sneaks along in the background for most of the running. And the story takes on a form that I am attempting to do in my first work - complete layers. Two people could watch this, and come away with different ideas and plot lines. This is exactly what a movie should do, keep everyone that sees it thinking about it afterwards. There is no definite ending or beginning, it is left purely to the imagination.The entire film seems like just a slice of someone's imagination, and when I watch it, I consider it mine."
robhan,"Jul 19, 2006",10/10,"I rented this film from Blockbuster after hearing about it from a friend. I was slightly reluctant, never seeing an anime film before, but I watched it six times before giving it back two days later, then bought it the next day. My daughter watched it with me every time and loved it as much as I did. It was an astonishing film, though scary at times, but wonderful the whole way through. It had some laugh out loud funny moments and the next minute you were on the edge of your seat and it all seemed so real. It really got me into anime. Since then I have also watched Howl's moving castle, which is fabulous. My daughter went one step further and learnt to draw manga. I must say she is quite good! She also is learning to play the opening theme on the piano. It's 4 pages long. Rather her than me! I would recommend this film to anybody. But be warned. It's very... different."
kennizle,"Jul 8, 2021",5/10,"I realy dont get the hype for this movie. I gave it a 5 star just because of the beautiful animation, but thats about the only thing that was good on this movie, it was boring and overrated..."
kraley,"Oct 4, 2002",N/A,"Good morning. Last night I was able to catch the Disney US Release of Spirited Away ( originally The Spiriting Away of Sen and Chihiro). This is another  Disney purchase of a Japanese hit. For those that don't know, Disney has a nasty habit of importing titles from Japan and then changing the story when dubbing films or creatively editing the endings or plot to ""suit American audiences"". Personally I think that's a travesty. So  whenever you go see the Disney release of a foreign film, realize the film you are watching may not be the 'same film' the rest of the world sees.OK, that aside, was it a good film? I deliberately did no research before seeing this film as I prefer to go into films with little or no expectations. All I knew was that the film was directed and written by Hayao Miyazaki, the same man responsible for Princess Mononoke ( a film released a few years back that I also enjoyed). In the case of Spirited away, I'm glad I did not know what I was getting myself into, otherwise I might not have come (and surprisingly, not for the reasons you likely assume).The film concerns a young girl and her parents who find an odd tunnel in the side of a hill while moving to their new home. Upon investigating the tunnel, they find a strange ""theme park"" on the other side devoid of inhabitants. Upon investigating the theme park, things are obviously very ""wrong"" (at least to the little girl- her parents seem woefully oblivious) and as it gets closer to sunset, things just get worse. Unfortunately, this is all the plot I am able to reveal without spoiling the uniqueness of this film.This is an 'adult-oriented' movie. It has some rather disturbing images and ranks among the weirdest films I have seen in my life. It's a bizarre amalgam of Wizard of Oz,The Neverending Story, Alice in Wonderland, My Friend Totoro, Chitty Chitty Bang Bang and The City of Lost Children (just to name a few). This film is interesting from beginning to end even though the plot advances rather slowly. There is always some new thing to see or some truly bizarre thing to witness. The animation is above average but not as impressive as Mononoke (and even features several gratuitous CGI sequences).There is a great story and some great humor. I laughed more in this film than I have at any Hollywood 'comedy' in the last 5 years (and Spirited Away is not a comedy, it just has several good comedic breaks). No nudity. No Profanity. No 'gratuitous' violence. Some rather disturbing scenes of characters getting eaten alive (and some threats thereof) but even the eaten characters return unharmed later in the film.This is not really a 'family film' (and definitely NOT a ""kiddee film"") but it is something you can take the whole family to. Smaller children will not understand the story, but they'll like the visuals and enjoy the humor. Mid-teens might be a bit ""weirded out"" by the subject matter and the visuals and older teens and adults may be too jaded by American cinema to enjoy the film for what it is- a lavish fairytale from a foreign country. This film runs about 2 hours so leave the ""kidney-buster"" sodas at the snack bar. If you have to take a bathroom break, you WILL miss something and I assure you no friend nor helpful audience member will likely be able to adequately convey what it is you DID just miss.If you enjoy Anime or the bizarre, make an effort to see this film. Even if you don't normally like ""cartoon movies"", you might give this one a chance. It is not a 'casual moviegoer' film by any means and does rely on some thought from the audience to enjoy it. It will also likely be the oddest film you'll see this decade and you'll be sure to remember this film long after all the other 'disposable movies' have faded from your recollection. This film is receiving almost no advertising. I didn't even know it existed until I saw the poster tucked away in a corner at the theatre earlier this week. I hope Disney puts a little more effort into advertising this film's release because it is truly an original film and worthy of a large audience. Hopefully positive word-of-mouth will get this film the attendance it deserves."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 2, 2023",8/10,"I'd class myself as a casual viewer, someone who's trying to broaden my horizon of movies, anime is perhaps not kryptonite, I can appreciate them, I don't often enjoy them.Spirited Away however, is one of the best animations I've ever seen, there's an incredible imagination behind this, a deep and complex story, mixed in with some tremendous visuals.I did have to read a few articles regarding the plot about forty minutes in, as I had a fair idea, vhr couldn't quite work out all that was going on, however as it developed it certainly opened up, the latter stages definitely seemed to make more sense, but if you struggle with the first twenty minutes or so, my advice is to stick with it.Best of all for me, the visuals, I thought this film even after two decades, looks absolutely incredible, it's a beautiful film. I thought the music was terrific too, totally in keeping with the spirit and vibe of the film.I watched this with English subbing, and the voiceover actors did a fine job. I was advised to watch it in its original format, but I was missing too much of the wonderful animation.Every time I watch an anime I seem to enjoy, this one was up a notch however, this is a film I've tried to encourage others to watch.8/10."

silentcheesedude,"Feb 27, 2005",10/10,"Upon hearing that this became Japan's highest grossing film ever, I went out of my way to look for a theater that had this movie here in the states. I traveled some, paid top dollar for the ticket, and, after seeing it, was totally blown away by the experience I had. I had no doubt in my mind that I have seen the best movie of the year, and quite possibly the best animated movie I have EVER seen.The story starts with a young girl named Chihiro, and her family, moving to a new place. When they wander into what seems like an abandoned theme park and her parents start to eat prepared food (but with no one around to attend them), they turn into pigs. Chihiro runs and encounters a bathhouse for the gods and spirits. With the help of a young boy named Haku, Chihiro learns that in order to reverse the effects of her parents dilemma, she must work in the bathhouse. Life isn't easy, not even for the gods. She'll come across bizarre creatures & places. She will learn hard work, the sense of loss, greed, & the importance of friendship and love.It's dreamy-like quality, it gorgeous scenes, and it's incredible list of characters (frogs that talk, a dragon, a baby that is 12 feet tall, a multi-armed boiler-room man) will keep you glued to the story.Children will love this film, yet it is sophisticated enough for adults to enjoy and relish in it's beauty. It does have it's scary bits and images, however, so very young children may be frightened. But this is still the type of movie that you go out and buy, even if you don't have children. So imaginative is the world that Chihiro falls in, thoughts of 'Alice in Wonderland' & 'The Wizard of Oz' may come to mind. But 'Spirited Away' ends up with it's own originality. It's a timeless piece, and will eventually be a classic that will no doubt be shown to generations.In the DVD, Disney made sure that the voice acting for the English version is top-notch, but, even if you don't liked dubbing, you have the option to switch to Japanese with subtitles.How could 'Spirited Away' become the first anime film to be nominated for, AND WIN an Academy Award? How did it gross $200 million before it even came to the states? The answer lies in mastermind creator Hayao Miyazaki. So well known in Japan, he is now getting the recognition he deserves internationally. With past hits like Princess Mononoke, Miyazaki and his studio, Ghibli, have created outstanding features that very few animation studios can even match. Their movies are hand-drawn, without all the CGI that many studios are using. Amid the fact that Disney has distributed these treasures, I would say that there isn't much in the Disney vaults that can even come close to matching what Miyazaki and his studio have produced.Do not hesitate to watch this magical, enchanting, and rare gem that we have the privilege to see. And if you have seen it, go out of your way to view the rest of Miyazaki's films, like 'Nausicaa', 'Castle in the Sky', & 'Kiki's Delivery Service'.Undeniably a perfect 10 out of 10"

Danherb,"Jun 2, 2005",10/10,"Seldom have I seen a movie full of such boundless fantasy, incredible beauty and opulent pictures. Miyazaki presents the story of Chihiro who has to rescue her parents from the spell of a witch in fantasy world with such extravagant richness that stuns the spectator.Granted the story about this fantasy world with all kinds of exceptionally weird creatures and situations takes needs getting used to at first. But very soon the spectator is totally engrossed by the magical story and overwhelming pictures.In view of the diversity of bizarre creatures, the filmmaker's creativity seems almost unlimited. The beautiful pictures have a very soothing and at the same time enthusiastic effect onto the spectator.But the brilliance of the movie doesn't only result from the beauty of the pictures, the story itself is very subtle and profound. In short, it is a story about growing-up. Chihiro and her parents are on their way to their new home in the suburbs when they accidentally step into a magical world, where Chihiro's parents are transformed into pigs. From now on, Chihiro has to manage everything by herself. She has to attempt to turn her parents back into humans and is confronted with situations and characters that don't coincidentally seem like metaphors of our world. Now, Chihiro learns how to solve problems herself and how to deal with the characters of the people she meets. At the end, Chihiro has turned into a almost mature person.Although occidental spectator won't be able to understand all symbolisms that are conveyed by the characters, but there's is actually no need of it. The fantastic world and its creatures perfectly work as a scenery for a wonderful coming-of-age story.The wonderful, as customary for composer Joe Hisaishi, music adds even more magical beauty to the scenery."
Soumyadeep9190,"Aug 10, 2025",10/10,"There are animated films, and then there is Spirited Away. This isn't just a movie you watch, it's a doorway to another world. A place where spirits work in bathhouses, where a train glides silently over a flooded plain, and where a simple act of kindness can change everything.Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli didn't just make an animated film; they crafted a living, breathing universe. Every frame is hand-painted with such care that you can almost feel the paper it was drawn on. In today's world, where AI can mimic a style in seconds, the painstaking devotion behind Ghibli's art feels even more precious. Each detail - from the flicker of a lantern to the swirl of a dragon's mane - is a love letter to craftsmanship.Joe Hisaishi's score feels like it's flowing straight from the heart of the story. Sometimes it whispers, sometimes it soars, but it always carries you deeper into Chihiro's journey.This film is more than a classic; it's a reminder of what art can be when it's made with soul. If you've never seen Spirited Away, watch it. Then watch Grave of the Fireflies. Only then will you truly understand why Studio Ghibli is untouchable."
GhoulVain,"Oct 15, 2025",10/10,"Spirited Away is a piece of my childhood that I'll never forget. The film captures everything that makes Studio Ghibli so special: the beautiful, distinctive art style, the charming and memorable characters, and an atmosphere that completely draws you in.The music is absolutely stunning - I get goosebumps every time I hear it. It carries a deep sense of nostalgia and emotion, instantly transporting me back to the wonder of being a child.The story itself is beautifully told - a blend of adventure, self-discovery, and magic. It feels timeless and continues to touch the heart no matter how many times you watch it. Even today, decades after its release, Spirited Away remains a true masterpiece - visually, emotionally, and narratively."
badtothebono,"Nov 24, 2005",6/10,"Hey. It IS a well-done piece of social commentary. This is Animal Farm for Japanese environmentalists. Saying this is a ""kid's movie"" is like saying ANimal Farm is a kid's book. Well, maybe they could finish it, but they can't understand 2% of the intent.The issue: how can anyone who isn't Japanese or have a detailed knowledge of Japanese culture & mythology give this anything above a 5? Without that knowledge, it is impenetrable. I've lived in Japan, but except for the fact that my wife, Japanese with a degree from perhaps their #1 liberal arts college, could help me with reference's, I would've been scratching my head. People, without the background, who rate this highly are just jumping on the bandwagon. Go ahead, discuss Animal Farm without talking politics. Same thing."
joecoby45,"Oct 5, 2017",5/10,"This is not a bad movie at all, but its really not that great either. I don't really understand what all the endless praise is over. The animation is amazing for sure but the story feels really convoluted. I don't really understand what the ghost character with the gold was. I didn't understand what he was or what we wanted exactly. Maybe i'm missing something.Also their is a character that apparently is a human but also a dragon and then later turns out to be a river spirit? The f*#k?!?!There is no real deep meaning in the movie as far as I can tell. The main character is fairly static throughout the whole movie and doesn't really grow or learn anything (she is also quite annoying at times)Also I'm not totally sure what the target audience is supposed to be here. At times it feels like a family movie sometimes it feels like a creepy horror movie with scary looking characters. I don't really know who this movie is for.As I said not a bad movie, but the story feels all over the place and feels pretty pointless when all is said and done."
gnta53,"Sep 10, 2004",N/A,"Mystical. Enchanting. A key to another world. There are so many ways to describe this movie. The movie focuses on a young girl who is trapped in a sort of ""spirit world"". When her mother and father are turned into pigs, young Chihiro has to save her parents before they're cooked and eaten. It may sound silly, but this tale has more to it than farm animals. When Chihiro is frightened, she runs off. When a boy finds her, he tells her that she must get a job at ""The Bath House"". A sort of retreat for spirits. But to do this, she must speak with Yubaba. The witch who rules The Bathhouse. After Yubaba agrees to give Chihiro some work. She takes her name away from her. And she is then called ""Sen"". While shes at the bath house, she is put under very hard work. I could say more, but that would be foolish of me. This is a great movie that I think people of all ages should see for themselves. Its an enchanting and heartwarming story that I've watched over and over again and have never gotten sick of it. It has been another inspiring movie from Haiyo Miazaki that is above all his best yet. A 10 out of 10 for this wonderful movie."
Niklyor,"Aug 22, 2025",10/10,"95/100Spirited Away is a breathtaking masterpiece of animation, where Hayao Miyazaki creates a world both fantastical and emotionally resonant. The film effortlessly blends adventure, whimsy, and subtle life lessons, inviting viewers of all ages into a richly imagined universe.The animation is exquisite - every frame is full of detail, color, and movement, bringing the spirits, creatures, and landscapes to life in a way that feels organic and immersive. The storytelling is layered, offering humor, suspense, and heart without ever becoming heavy-handed.Unique Insight: Beyond its enchanting visuals, Spirited Away subtly explores themes of growth, responsibility, and identity, inspired by Miyazaki's own reflections on childhood and the fleeting nature of innocence."
Vixo_Six,"Jul 22, 2025",10/10,"""Once you do something, you never forget. Even if you can't remember.""Spirited Away is one of those truly special films that leave a lasting mark. The first thing I'd highlight is the animation: despite the years, it remains stunning, with an incredible level of detail and care that makes it timeless. The script is equally brilliant, because everything feels intentional. Nothing seems random - the characters' names, the colors, the symbols, each element appears to carry a clear and deliberate meaning.More than just an adventure story, this film is a powerful metaphor for life's changes and personal growth. At the beginning, Chihiro is an immature and dependent child, but as the story unfolds and she faces different realities, she gains bonds, courage, and self-confidence. The movie is full of symbolism: characters and situations that seem to represent different facets of her personality - loneliness, the need to adapt, the journey to discover her identity, and confronting the unknown.Another fascinating layer is its subtle critique of contemporary society, particularly the cultural shifts in Japan: consumerism, the loss of individuality in favor of becoming just ""a number"" in the workforce, and greed embodied by certain characters. Every scene is rich with meaning, allowing multiple interpretations and rewarding each rewatch with new discoveries.Spirited Away is a masterpiece disguised as a children's tale, delivering a profound message about how we face change, how we grow, and above all, how we must always remember who we are. No matter how scary change may seem, if we embrace it while holding on to our identity, everything will be fine. An essential film for all ages that I highly recommend."

All of it is perfect and I will never get tired of watching this movie! I grew up with this movie and even though it scared me as a child I later went back and rewatched it and I learned to appreciate it as the masterpiece it is. Chihiro's character development from being a whiny, bratty little girl to being a more responsible and mature person is great. The characters and the way they look are also amazing from Yubaba who runs the spirit bathhouse to Kamaji who runs the boiler room are all so interesting and very well developed. I love this movie so much."

It might just be the dazzling collaboration of computer animation, and the classic anime animation, but this movie is eye candy. That isn't the only great thing about it though. It has a very compelling story line, that goes up there with some other great films, that will forever hold a place in our hearts. Another dazzling feature in this movie, is the music. It perfectly mixes, classical, European music, and Japanese music, it its glory. I must say, that when i first saw this movie, i had no idea that it existed. That isn't in any way a problem though, considering that most originally Japanese movies aren't very well known in America. Overall, this movie is simply brilliant, and actually made me feel like a better person. It also includes many different, deep ideas, that actually caught my attention, and my heart strings, much more than anything that could come out of ""The Matrix"" or something. So, indeed, this movie is one of the greatest, which i have ever had the pleasure of viewing. I would completely recommend seeing it, and i am giving it a perfect 10/10."
Craigelink,"Mar 16, 2020",6/10,"Maybe you need to be from the country this was made in to understand certain subtleties in this but I found it whilst interesting, very lacking in plot and direction. Nothing was really well explained and it seems bizarre a lot of the choices that chihiro makes. Maybe I missed it but it was a non rewatched for me"
michaelradny,"Oct 20, 2015",6/10,"The beautiful looking work of Spirited Away will catch you breathless from the get go, but sadly the story will neither entice nor enthrall you enough to stay focused on what's happening. The films story feels rather surreal and incoherent, giving no indication to what and why characters do certain actions. It also fails at being anything near original, muddling up previously used stories and creating one big jumbled mess.Whilst the story of Spirited Away may be hard for some to understand, one cannot leave the film without praising the artwork. It almost makes up for a lack of a coherent storyline, but for the most part the story does leave you wanting to know more; but to know more about what's happening, not about what's going to happen."
subscriptions,"Sep 7, 2006",5/10,"I am baffled by how much people like this pointless and annoying movie. The protagonist is an irritating and uninteresting little girl, and the film has essentially no plot. It presents a series of weird encounters and situations, without ever a sense that it's going anywhere, and without ever showing an interesting way of dealing with them by the little girl. Rather, whatever she does happens for magical reasons to have been the right thing, giving the impression that we're watching her have one of those dreams in which she can do no wrong. For some reason people like this parade of strangeness without a plot or a likable protagonist enough to rate this film higher than Grave of the Fireflies and Princess Mononoke, excellent films that actually have great characters, compelling plots, and in the latter case, also very imaginative encounters and situations."
JWick23,"Dec 18, 2020",N/A,What did I just watch. Maybe it wasn't targeted for people like me but I watched it cuz this anime was highly praised and is considered a masterpiece so I decided to give it a shot.So enough with my rant let's into how I rated it. Music and visuals were absolutely amazing for this anime. I really enjoyed especially the character art and movement of the characters. The music had this aesthetic and calm feeling to it which I enjoyed.The problem occurs with the story and the characters. The story or the plot was hella confusing there is one thing and then pops another thing and then another just to get the water flowing and with no reason whats so ever. And the plot made like literally no sense whatsoever. The characters were alright but there were some confusing moments and decisions the characters made. The themes aren't exactly well shown and I didnt seem to find any or understand it well.But for all the problems I sort of enjoyed it I don't know why but it had this calm feeling as if you are dreaming. But I'm also the type of guy to not like a kid's movie or a fantasy movie with a few exceptions.Memorable: No Rewatchable: No.
KellyRikDixon,"Jan 1, 2005",8/10,"Chihiro and her parents are driving to their new house. She's upset to leave her old friends and school. When her father gets them lost in the woods, they stumble across what appears to be an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off and is sucked into a bath-house in a new world, a world of spirits. Chihiro is guided by Haku, henchman of the witch who controls the bath-house. The two of them work hard together to help Chihiro escape and rescue her parents. The youngster proves herself to be as independent as any spirit and fights through many distractions and inconveniences to return to her own world. Even though she's scared and upset, she makes some close friends among the eccentric characters she meets.I've loved Miyazaki's work as long as I have known it but nothing compares to the experience of Spirited Away. I had not heard of the movie and had seen no trailers, so the unexpected animation was almost perfect. The characters were quite unique and no sane viewer would refuse the offer to follow the child in her enchanting adventure.For years, I've always thought that one of the most important factors of a good movie is the way the title is presented at the beginning and there is no better example to prove my point than in this film. The music is completely overwhelming, especially the attractive sequence displayed at the beginning and repeated throughout.There is very little criticism available, only that it's possible that the unique imagination of Hayou Miyazaki is not appreciated to the extent it should be by the viewers.I've read other reviews and think it's unfair to compare the work with Disney's as the last thing I would call this feature is a 'children's' movie. The two styles are aiming at different audiences and both succeed."
benoitlelievre,"May 10, 2005",10/10,"Remniscient of his fellow Japanese animator Satoshi Kon, Hayao Miyazaki offers us a good bath of Japanese folklore, suited in a well edited, fast paced, americanized form of animation. Miyazaki is more than a director, he's a writer. He's that kind of director that never leaves any kind of detail behind in quest to make a movie look over the top. This one was magnificent. Despite being billed as a child movie, well it ain't one, it's one of the most colorful audacious and creative anime ever made.The setting of the plot, from the start, makes room for creativity. Trapped in a spirit world, Chihiro has to grow as a person to fight the dangers on her way back to normality and back to her parents. In an avalanche of obstacles that rivals any literary epic, Chihiro grows a willpower that will go beyond of what she every imagined. Spirited Away is the epitome of true cinema. It exploits the possibilities and the variables that cinema has to offer. Every choice Miyazaki makes for his movie is the good one. Truly astonishing.So make the good choice too, buy this movie."
Rantzien,"Feb 1, 2005",10/10,"This movie is a masterpiece. It is perfected into the smallest detail. This is definitely the best animated movie I have ever seen.When I looked at the cover of this movie I thought it looked kinda boring. But that was exactly the opposite of what it was. It is full of creatures you've never heard of, and even though it's not said it is a comedy, it is completely full-stuffed of totally hilarious moments.To name some of the great stuff in this movie: The characters are very worked-through and totally original, I have never seen such an example of imagination. There is no flat characters either, that means there are no such boring things as an all-the-way-through evil or good character.The story is also very original. If you just read the story here on IMDb it might not seem very special or interesting (I didn't have very high expectations on the movie after reading the backside of the DVD), but trust me, when things start happening, you'll find yourself completely stuck.This movie is a great example (and proof) that you don't need 3d or cool explosion effects to make a really great movie! If you haven't seen it, do it! NOW!"
derfybarfy,"Jan 11, 2006",10/10,"What this movie does so well, and why i love it so much, is because it takes me to a completely different world, so beautifully drawn and so magically in every single aspect and filled with wonderful characters that makes this film, like no other film, leave me with an inner joy that is indescribable.The only thing i truly hate about this film, is that I'm always so disappointed when it's over, and I'm left in this boring inferior world called ""reality"" again.Anyways, if you for some weird reason haven't watched it yet, i got one advice for you:Watch it. Now."
jasminntan,"Apr 30, 2020",10/10,"I've heard so many good things about this movie and it exceeded all of my expectations. It was a visually stunning and the story was one that emphasised on identity, love and doing the right thing. By the end of the movie, I was feeling nostalgic for some reason and it made me love the movie even more."
jpdanzig-152-383072,"Jul 8, 2017",7/10,"This animated film is pretty to look at, but IMO it was endless and rather meaningless, at least to this western viewer.Perhaps this film holds meaning to those cognizant of Japanese mythology, but although the protagonist is changed by her strange adventure here, there seems to be no moral lesson to be learned other, perhaps, than ""act with kindness toward others."" John Lasseter admires this film and its maker, but then he brought us the three ""Cars"" films, so what does he know? At least the first Cars film had a discernible message.."
zerogirl42,"Dec 28, 2006",10/10,"Fun characters, interesting story, top-notch animation, and excellent music are just some of the highlights.If you enjoy whimsical fantasy, run to rent this film. It's not just for children.It was so nice to see a good, fantasy animation. I actually watched Spirited Away twice in the theater. The first time was with subtitles. I enjoyed it so much, I took some of my friends to see it a second time. This time I saw the English-dubbed version. I sat back and caught much more than the first time. I couldn't believe how much I missed without the dub. I could also get more emotionally involved and feel more connected to the film. The voice-acting was excellent.I just saw Princess Mononoke which got me thinking about Spirited Away. I was told that they were made by the same people. Although they are both good films, I would say Spirited Away is better over all."
A_Kind_Of_CineMagic,"Oct 31, 2013",6/10,"I apologise to the seemingly massive fanbase for these Miyazaki films but I find them totally over praised.I cannot see what people find so amazing about them. The scripts are totally banal and unnatural with nothing that makes me feel any emotion or humour. I find the dialogue boring and idiotic to be honest.Yes the animation is what must attract people mainly I guess but is it just me or is it no better than the weird cartoons I used to watch on kids TV in the 80s like Ulysees, City of Gold or Thundercats? I just would accept it as a kid in the 80s and it is not terrible but while quirky it is neither clever nor realistic nor beautiful. I am not impressed.The stories are mostly weird. In this case it is weird and unengaging for me. I cannot see why people rate it so highly. The characters are drab and cold or sullen and the script is nothing to get me interested at all. The kookiness is all that I can see to attract people. I feel it appeals to the kind of computer game playing, does not leave their bedroom type of geek who has not grown up. It is neither for children nor for adults which is my main disconnect I think. Just my opinion."
Elise_Graham,"Sep 22, 2003",N/A,"All I can say about this film is. . . I cannot see why this film is such a masterpiece to some people.  Answer me this.  They take so much time to do detailed back grounds, which are beautiful, but are hidden by the grotesque characters that seem to all look the same to me, no matter what kind of anime.  I found myself being lost in the plot several times, with very poor character development, and apparently hyperactive dubbing.  What I mean by that is, how come everything they say, not matter what it is, comes out all in one rushed, messy breath.  Though, I did find this movie rather a comedy. My brother and I had a few good laughs, especially when Sen runs down the stairs and smacks into the wall.  That was pretty funny, I must say.  The only reason why we went to the movie in the first place was because my brother recieved credit extra credit for his college class for watching it. What a waste of over 2 hours of my life!  I could have been sharpening pencils, or making paper airplanes! Also, I found that there were characters that seemed to play no part at all.  Example:No face.  Ok, so he is the bad guy for about, 5 minutes, but then has no real purpose for being in the movie.  What is with that guy anyway.  Eeesh!  I have nightmares about that one. . . In conclusion, I just want to say, that through out this on going movie, I was ended up multipul times getting lost and confused.  My eyes also started to hurt after watching the choppy animation move across the screen.  I give this movie, on a scale from 1 to 5, 1 being the worst, 5 being the best, I gets a big, fat 1, or maybe a zero.  No, one.  I liked the backgrounds and things that they actually spent time on. . . It is too bad Disney had to take part in this film. . ."
xxxpenguinoxxx,"Jun 5, 2005",10/10,"Sen to Chihiro No Kamikakushi (Spirited Away) is a fantastic journey. This movie will keep you entertained through the entire movie, I have never witnessed a more touching and beautiful movie in my entire life. Spirited Away is a must see for all ages and will keep you watching over and over for years to come. Even for those of you not interested in animated movies this one will surely brighten your day, the animation is unbelievable and the characters are very life-like. In fact in my opinion all aspects of this film are absolutely flawless, do yourself a favor and watch this film. In conclusion Spirited Away is a fantastic film and I for one will be watching it for years and years. Bye!"
killbillroxxorz,"May 24, 2005",10/10,"Was on the old Atari forums one day and searching through the movie section of the forum and I saw a thread on a Spirited Away movie. I have always been a big fan on Anime; I like Cowboy Bebop, Bubblegum Crisis, Neon Genesis and Kenshin. So when I continued reading it got great feedback from my friends on there. So once it came out on DVD I rented it and I must say, one of the best animation movies I've ever seen. The passion in the movie is extravagant, the animation is beautiful and the voice acting is astonishing.The story is about a little girl named Chihiro and her family, they are moving to a brand new house. On there way to there house there dim-witted father takes a short cut which leads them to what seems to be a abandoned old style Japanese amusement park where traveling through they find some food. Even though Chihiro's objection the Parents stuff there faces, which strangely enough turns them into pigs. Things get worst, she loses her way she came back and there are ghost like spirits around her. Her only way to get her parents back is help out by a boy naked Haku. She must meet the main boss of the Bath House, Yubaba, to retrieve them back. She must work for her food and to fight to get her parents back. Along with getting her name back! The evil Yubaba changes it to Sin. On the way she meets a text book of characters featuring my favorite, No Face.The animation in this film is stunning, vibrant colors, stunning backdrops and character design are great! The voice work is done perfectly, bringing across the emotion that is written in this script. Famous anime director Hayao Miyazaki who won an Oscar for this masterpiece has done well and should be proud of his years of work. Which include movies like Princess Mononoke etc.I suggest if you want to see a powerful, moving and up lifting movie that make you forget its an animation film, watch this film ASAP!"
aimeeluna,"Feb 2, 2005",10/10,"Hayao Miyazaki's Spirited Away is a surreal, entertaining, and refreshing film for adults (not for kids who may find it weird). It portrays a very colorful cast with a simple plot line. It transports viewers to a dreamy land of super-natural, makes it a little frightening, yet because of the main character's innate innocence (she being a child), adult viewers are reminded how to be kids again...in another light. In the end, Miyazaki's constant message (it appears to be an ongoing call) prevails: protect our environment. :)Like all of Miyazaki's films, it is an expected hit, not only for its intricate plot line, but also for the name of the director himself. Attach Miyazaki's name, and Japan comes lining up. Too bad for America though, since they have yet to line up for a film that actually conveys a worthwhile message. Animations films in America are still equated for the kids' market, and it's a pity that it is still being marketed for them without considering animation as a distinct genre for all market groups."
emptymask,"Feb 20, 2005",10/10,"Normally I am detested by Japanese Animated features. I come from a background of loving many of the old Warner Brothers cartoons, and saw Jap-Animation as a threat, along side of Mtv, Nickelodean, and Cartoon Network, ruining children's cartoons. (I really prefer not to elaborate because I don't want to push any buttons on this board.) But this movie was phenomenal, its very rare that I am impressed by modern cartoons now days but this film dazzled me so much that I had to rewind the film and watch it again the next day. There is so much neo-mythology and Post Alice Traumatic Stress Syndrome in this movie that I was tickled, honestly. There is a lot of imagination and colorful ideas and I wish that there can be many more animated pictures of this quality to come in the future - the movie resembled a lot of the wacky weirdness that were around in the old Betty Boop or Silly Symphonies cartoons, the animators really touched a chord in me and I thank them full heartedly."
IkuharaKunihiko,"Jul 7, 2006",6/10,"Chihiro, a little girl, is sitting in a car driven by her parents. They are moving to a new town, but on their way they enter into a strange town through a tunnel. There mom and dad transform into pigs because they ate the forbidden food and Chihiro has to take a job in the local spa, run by the old lady Yubaba, in order to transform them back. She gets a new name, Sen, and meets a nice boy Haku...-------""Spirited Away"", Hayao Miyazaki's 8th feature length anime film, is an interesting fantasy parable. It does have poetry ( a magical scene in which Chihiro is falling from the sky, making her tears fall up ) and some analysts claim that the story is actually a symbol of child prostitution or child slavery in Asia, but as a whole the overlong movie doesn't always work perfectly and it seems as if the critics are finding more meanings which they want to find than the ones that are really there. If Miyazaki's earlier films were less ambitious ( with which I strongly disagree - i. e. ""Kiki's delivery service"" was a wonderful tale about growing up ), then his new ones are less fun and coherent. Miyazaki finally won an Oscar for this, but more thanks to his previous reputation than thanks to the good, but somewhat over-hyped anime ""Spirited Away"".Grade: 6/10"
electronmove,"Mar 21, 2022",8/10,"This movie is all about alienation and moving to a different world (or suburb, as you will). It captures the feeling of being trapped in this alien world full of new places, new people, and strange legends and myths that you grow accustomed to overtime. Each character that the protagonist meets is in someway an archetype of a personality you confront as a child without knowing you're confronting them at first and draws upon those archetypes to craft a journey through what seems like a pit of despair at first until you begin to take more control of the situation, essentially ""growing up"". There are a few Japanese cultural quirks that drag down an other-wise stellar animated film, but it still shines as an exemplary childhood tale."
dovahhobbit,"Apr 30, 2023",6/10,"First off, yes; I admit I'm in the minority when i say i did not enjoy this movie.Second, i get that it's a ""coming of age"" sort of movie.Third, what exactly did i watch again?I've seen this movie all the way through once, halfway to the ending, and quarter to the ending, in reverse order. And i can say that no matter how much of the movie i watched, nothing became any clearer.It's a huge nothing burger, with characters that don't make sense, and don't have time to allow you to make sense of them.Credit where it's due. For the time it was made, YES, the animtion is good.The writing just made no sense and was WAY too random way too frequently.I'd try to watch it again, but I'm not interested.I've thought of asking friends to explain it, but maybe I'll just keep this one to myself.I'd give less stars, but I really didn't dislike it, so much as just simply not get what people love so much about this ""masterpiece""."
jackgdemoss,"Mar 16, 2020",5/10,"I went in expecting that this movie would have a chance of being one of my all time favorites. I couldn't have been more wrong. This is just a bad experience. The character and world design was great but the motivations and plot were snooze inducing. Take this review with a grain of salt, however, because I watched it dubbed. From what I have read, watching it dubbed completely changes the experience for whatever reason, so hopefully I can get back around to watching it correctly sometime."
goatrealm,"Oct 25, 2003",N/A,"a morbid curiosity usually compels me to finish watching movies that are dull and pointless, but PRINCESS MONONOKE's lack of interestingness had me reaching for the 'eject' button halfway thru. after hearing some of the accolades heaped on SPIRITED AWAY, i thought i'd give miyazaki another spin, and, boy, was i sorry.the movie's moral lessons veer toward the obvious--nothing groundbreakingly profound here--and are presented in an overly drawn-out fashion. here's an incomplete listing of SPIRITED AWAY's nice sentiments:a) don't be a glutton. b) care about your friends. c) look after your parents. d) do not value money above human (or inhuman) relationships. e) work hard, despite the drudgery of it all.now, the story is supposed to impart these valuable lessons by putting the protagonist in a dreamworld setting, where other, more twisted lessons are inextricably (and inexplicably) presented. whether intentional or not, the movie also implies:a) one should trust strangers who lounge about, even if they eat people and later regurgitate them. jeffrey dahmer, anyone? b) one should make pacts with evil persons to get what one wants. c) parents are pigs, and children must will be their salvation. d) people who try to do good things for you now might have done good things for you in the past (perhaps even a past life?), so go ahead and trust them--your instincts will guide you.well, so much for the beautifully inspiring movie everyone seems to be gushing about. . . .speaking of beauty, i never found the animation that impressive: the same jerky, low-frame-rate presentation that plagues japanese anime is found here. (i did enjoy, though, the transformation of the witch into her airborne self--that was the movie's funkiest moment.)and the nonsensical array of creatures inhabiting the world of SPIRITED AWAY reminds me of george lucas at his inane worst.i don't think i'll ever have the itch to watch another miyazaki film again; the dullness and vapidity are just excruciating."
ranabotola,"Sep 1, 2003",10/10,"this is a masterpiece. suggest me something (not coming from studio ghibli, obviously) that as a plot and an animation at a such high quality. or just suggest me another animation movie in which you can't imagine what it will be going on except the happy ending (that is a must in 98% of animation movies due they are more directed to children than normal movies). sorry but i can't figure no disney/pixar/don bluth's/dreamworks animation movie that can get just a little close to this movie. i hope that you have seen the others miyazaki's works, but i'm not sure of it.i just wanted to say you that looking for mistakes or lacks in a such movie it means u didn't get a clue. i'm a bit sorry for u. byby"
Harmaa_Hevonen,"Sep 7, 2003",10/10,"I never understood the art of anime, manga or whatever. Always thought it's something... just not for me. I saw several ""Robotech"" series while being a kid, but they never amused me the same way Western animations did. But when a friend of mine suggested me to see this one, saying her kids liked it much, I thought to myself: ""Anyway, why not?""...Well, may be I will never see anime again. Just because it's hard to imagine some other movie can be as good as this one. Screamingly-amazing, and no less. The characters, the music, the backgrounds are truly wonderful. A definitely must-see for everyone interested in animation regardless of it's time. Even people who dislike anime for some reason got to see this one. Truly educational experience, that is.The look of couple of characters was someway familiar to me. May be I saw something like that in Russian animation pieces of early 80's and 90's? Or is it just the Animation Spirit kidding around?"
jello_o,"Nov 9, 2004",8/10,"Miyazaki once again demonstrates his clear perception of the child psyche in this excellent, beautiful, and almost haunting masterpiece of the animated form.I first saw ""Spirited Away"" in Japanese, and then in English, dubbed by pixar, and i must say, both versions are excellent indeed.The film begins with the journey of a small child, dragged along by her parents, waiting and watching and being what small children are. Then, as her excitable (and foolish) father is attracted by a ""theme park"" in the middle of a mysterious wood, the entire world changes in more ways than the viewer would have easily imagined.The juxtaposition of expectation and result, fear and wonderment, awe and love... create an atmosphere, and a FEELING, that truly transcends any genre, stereotype, or precedent to the film. If you go into it expecting anime, expect the unexpected. If you go into it expecting horror, prepare to be swept away with the amazement of the ""revelations"" --if i may use the word tenuously-- which are at the center of this film's sweeping grandiosity. It is a wower indeed.As for a more specific definition, This is a film based mainly upon the legends of the ""gods"" and ""spirits"" of Japanese legend and lore. It takes place mainly in a ""bathhouse of the gods"" a place where the spirits of the world (in this movie) come to relax, cleanse themselves of dirt and grime, and fraternize with other inhuman beings.The entire experience is truly magical and not to be missed, so please, open your eyes, open your minds (at least a little), sit back, and enjoy the (marvelous) show."
almonme,"Oct 26, 2002",10/10,"At the level of Totoro, this movie shows the widest and most astonishing repertoire of visual imaginery and  creative storylines. The movie creates seemingly effortlesly a completely new world with its internal coherent laws that works amazingly, at least for me."
soanim8ed,"Aug 29, 2002",10/10,"Spirited Away is the latest in a string of incredible animated films by Hayao Miyazaki, the most renowned animator in Japanese history and most say in the best in world.  He takes a couple steps close to the best in the world title with this film.It's the story of Chihiro as she is caught in a world where humans are not allowed: a world of magic, gods and a Japanese bathhouse.  As we meet Chihiro we realize that she is a bit spoiled and has never done anything for herself.  As her adventures progress, she matures in ways that she doesn't even realize.  This is a journey of self-discovery and a study in forced independence.Many have compared it to Alice In Wonderland, but where Alice, I thought, was a two-dimensional character going from adventure to adventure, Chihiro is well rounded.  She figures out how to be adaptable to an ever-changing world and discovers how to solve her problems instead of running away from them.  She is a `real' girl shoved into a world of Japanese mythology where she is ignorant of the rules.And her problem solving is the best part of the film and the reason I liked this one better then Princess Mononoke.  Chihiro uses her kindness, courage and courtesy as her weapons.  Even when violence erupts all around her, she relies on her wit and intelligence instead of magic, swords or arrows. These are lessons that children should be exposed to instead of explosions and gore that make up a lot of cinema. If I had kids, you bet I'd be taking them to see this one.But don't get me wrong; this film is able to thrill adults, too.  It is so full of imagination the film seems barely able to contain itself.  While it is not as lush as Mononoke (it may have been the print I saw), Spirited Away is gorgeously animated and the dubbing work is almost perfectly synched.  In fact, after Chihiro is whisked away I didn't even notice anything out of place.There were; however, about three scenes that I remember thinking that the score seemed out of place and became distracting, but that's my only complaint.  I can easily see why this is Japan's biggest moneymaking film of all time.  It's a story well told with visuals beautiful to behold.  It's simply timeless."
TartanScorsese,"Oct 2, 2023",6/10,"One of the most random films I've seen. I felt that almost none of the events that took place were justified by any sort of premise, making it impossible to understand the purpose of any of it. I don't mind films with off the wall details thrown in, but here the entire plot is off the wall. I'm sure most of what happens is supposed to be metaphorical, but I couldn't work out what any of the metaphors actually were. Don't get me wrong, it was visually entertaining, but you would expect more than just pretty visuals for a film with this much of a positive reputation. If you go in expecting a standard cartoon you might be pleasantly surprised, if you expect a masterpiece, you may well be disappointed."
seventhnaga,"Sep 10, 2005",9/10,"Leave any preconceptions about this being a kids film at home, this is breathtaking. A simple enough story, told with such charm and imagination that it is hard not to love. In every moment there are elements that western cinema might spin into a whole film, but here they are just passing ideas. Every location is so full of life and spirit (pun intended) that a totally immersive atmosphere envelops the viewer at every stage.The film is gentle, yet does not shy away from death and emotion. It's not over-sentimental in it's approach either, just perfectly balanced. It made me genuinely laugh out loud, and cry too - a film hasn't provoked this reaction in me for five years.I have never seen such a brilliant animation, it surpasses the Bellvue Rendezvous and any other you care to think of. It's not just amongst animations that this film should be compared, it's amongst all films, of every genre, for the young or old. Standing tall among giants, this is truly great cinema."

cosmic_quest,"Oct 6, 2004",N/A,"My previous experience with Studio Ghibli began and ended with 'My Neighbour Totoro' but upon seeing the fantastic 'Spirited Away', I feel as if a whole new world of anime and Hayao Miyazaki has just opened up to me. Until now, apart from the odd Disney flick and, of course, 'My Neighbour Totoro', I had long consigned animation to childhood but this film is a perfect example of how how rich and diverse even an animated film can be.'Spirited Away' centres on ten-year-old Chihiro, a little Japanese girl who accidentally stumbles upon the Spirit World while exploring a mysterious passageway with her parents. When her parents are turned into pigs for stealing food, it falls to young Chirhiro and Haku, her guide in this strange new world, to save them before they become bacon. Not only are the characters well-depicted and engaging (with a few adorable little creatures added in to gush over!) but the story is very involving. During Chihiro's quest, not only do we see she and Haku grew as characters but we learn much about Japanese mythology and the moral of how not everything is as it seems. The atmospheric and other-worldly quality of the film leaves the audience feeling as if they too have joined the young heroine in this strange new land where the impossible seems possible.Although this film will no doubt appeal to young children who will easily identify with Chihiro, there is a dark air to 'Spirited Away' that will draw in teenagers and adults. Certainly, older viewers will be left awe-struck by the intelligence and strength of the plot and the characters. Highly recommended to anime fans and those who are just looking for a film that is unique and interesting."
vivi-ornetier,"May 13, 2006",10/10,"this was my first anime movie i saw and i must say, i've never seen such a beautiful world. it's full off colors, fantasy and the music is great it's a very good story! THIS is A must SEE movie. this can't be the empty space in your movie closet. The animation in this movie is very nice. Miyazaki's other work is great to. like kiki's delivery service or howl's moving castle. the style is almost the same but that makes this movie so cool. when i watched this movie i felt happy. there are some scene's where i had to laugh out loud. if you've seen this movie then be sure to watch the rest (if you liked spirited away that is) all of his movies are great! People who like to watch anime will regret it wen they wont go and see this movie. it's an adventure watching this movie"
nickname1,"Sep 29, 2003",9/10,"'Spirited Away' is a Japanese film, and is available in the UK in dubbed & subtitled versions. I saw the subtitled film and (with the exception of occasional gaps & pauses in the subtitling) I judge it to be the best animation since Akira, or possibly even Pinnoccio. The storyline is (in outline) no more incredible than most anime, but the film excels because it is bursting with unusual ideas. The imaginative imagery is wedded with fine, detailed animation and evocative music. Some parts of the film (chases/drives through foliage/flowers/within the bath-house) are exceptionally detailed and visually striking. There are (thankfully few) portions of the film soundtrack that suffer an outbreak of a Richard Clayderman-esque piano composition (IMO), but generally the sound supports the animation well and the animation was continually stimulating and moving. I give this (original film with subtitles)  9 OUT OF 10."
FilmOtaku,"Nov 9, 2003",9/10,"I will admit hesitation in viewing the latest Miyazaki film, simply because of my own close-minded first impression of it.  Historically, I can appreciate the beauty and artistry in all of his films, but I find that I prefer the films that center more on characters (Kiki's Delivery Service, Whispers of the Heart) as opposed to animals and nature (Mononoke Hime, Porco Rosso).  Therefore, after seeing that this film was more fantasy than reality, I was not in a hurry to see it.Unfortunately, this meant that I missed out on having seen a masterpiece for several months.  Spirited Away, the story of a little girl who must somehow escape from a world inhabited by fantastical characters is as much about her own evolution and strength in character as it is about the incredible creatures that surround her in her new environment.  While Spirited Away is a fairy tale, it is also a lesson in accountability, strength and responsibility. 	 Miyazaki is known for creating strong young female characters that are also completely adorable, but Spirited Away contains some of the most interesting co-stars I have seen in recent memory.  A lamp that not only provides a guiding light, but also happens to hop along on one foot, a giant baby and a bird with the head of an elderly lady are just three of the many eccentric characters we experience.  Not only are the characters and story line rich, but the artistry is absolutely beautiful as well.  The colors and character design are flawless and awe-inspiring.  Even I, the cynical and technical viewer found myself saying `Aww' and smiling at the little soot monsters and the `mouse'.The hype was worth it and the Oscar was well-deserved.  Spirited Away is a beautiful film that really and truly should be experienced, and has the potential of being enjoyed by most, because it has so many layers and imaginative aspects that there will be points of appeal for just about anyone.--Shelly"
gomaster88,"Jul 8, 2005",10/10,"Here I find myself again reviewing another great Miyazaki movie. Spirted Away in my opinion is probably the second best Miyazaki movie to date with Grave of the Fireflies in first and Naussica in third. Spirted Away is a great movie for kids and adults alike. I found that it was not very scary, but some moments your kids might find more frightening then others. In this film it doesn't seem to have much of the nature mixed in with the plot, though when Chihiro meets the River Spirit he has tons of trash inside of his body, which is what Miyazaki saw in a river my his city while he was walking. It is rated PG for scary image. I give it a 9.25 out of 10."
samkfield,"Jun 27, 2005",10/10,"This is probably the best animated film ever, it is powerful an unique and very fun. You definitely should see it, in the movie a little girl is transported to a magical world where her family has been turned into pigs by an evil witch who runs a spirit bath. The little girl must work for the witch and plot ways to get her parents back with the help of some friends she makes. The world she enters is the most incredible world ever conceived and i mean that, If you have not seen other movies the director of this film has made you should they are very very good, some include, Castle in the Sky, Princess Mononoke, Kiki's Delivery service and most recently Howl's Moving castle which is now in theaters any way this is a very good film that you should rent when you get around to it which you probably won't"
masontullis,"Dec 11, 2021",7/10,"First of all I am American and I haven't watched anime in the past. I wanted to see this movie because of its great reviews and resilience over the years. All together it was a very interesting film. I loved the score, the visual effects were stunning. There were scenes where I felt I was watching a Claude Monet painting. Stunning and very very creative. Even the characters developed beautifully. My biggest problem with the film was the randomness of the story. Granted I know nearly nothing about Japanese folk lore. The story was all over the place with random ""side missions"" that some how ended up helping the girl reach her goals. A lot of things that happened seemed to fall into place too perfectly. But we are talking about a film where a girl enters a magical spirit world so maybe it's not that hard to believe. Overall I think it deserves the recognition that it gets. It's fun to watch a movie that isn't made for my type of person that is still enjoyable to experience."
pixiekitten,"Jul 16, 2005",10/10,"This is my absolute favorite movie of all time. Seriously. The animation is amazing; and the plot is fabulous. I can't say this is a comedy, but a lot of the creatures were hilarious: the Susuwarti (fuzz balls), the bouncing green heads. Hayao Miyazaki has a way of doing that with most of his fantastic films. I just LOVE this movie!! Whoever hasn't seen it really should; nobody I know hasn't liked it. I just couldn't believe the animation...unbelievable, that's why! Some of it looks real! The first time I saw this, some parts made me jump, like the part where Chihiro's foot breaks through the wooden stair. Surprising! This movie was intensely good. Perfect!"
masonfewel,"May 9, 2021",6/10,Why the heck was it rated so high? Nothing made sense and it wasn't the best movie or anime by any standards. I can't for the life of me realize why this movie is held in such high regard.
BA_Harrison,"Jun 22, 2013",3/10,"As a huge fan of both animation and Japanese cinema, I have long felt more than a little embarrassed by my ignorance of celebrated director Hayao Miyazaki. Having tried to rectify this situation somewhat by watching the highly acclaimed animé Spirited Away, I no longer feel so bad about neglecting his work for so long: I found the film hugely undeserving of the glowing praise heaped upon it and I imagine it'll probably be quite a while before I tackle another of Miyazaki's 'classics'.Although Spirited Away is undeniably impressive visually, with stylish animation and imaginative design throughout, everything else about the film leaves A LOT to be desired, especially the trite story, in which a little girl, Chihiro, gets lost in a strange world and encounters a series of whimsical fantasy characters while trying to find her way home. It's The Wizard of Oz, but without the star quality of Garland, the amazing flying monkeys, catchy tunes, cute dog, and over-sexed dwarfs in garish outfits; it's Alice in Wonderland without the pungent whiff of opium; it's Labyrinth without the allure of a teenage Jennifer Connelly, the star power of Bowie, and the magic of Henson; it's Coraline, but.errr nowhere near as good (speaking of Neil Gaiman, it reminded a lot of Mirrormask, which also bored me to tears with its random, meandering narrative)."
jcye2001,"Dec 11, 2004",N/A,"I have seen many anime movies made by Hayao Miyazaki, such as PRINCESS MONONOKE, NAUSICAA OF THE VALLEY OF WIND, LAPUTA: CASTLE IN THE SKY, etc. He's movies are all very meaningful and there's no word to describe how I feel watching these movies! He's just that good. While FEW PEOPLE may think it's not a good movie, it's only because they don't understand it. They have no clue about Japanese culture and they aren't very open-minded about it either. After seening all these anime movies, my desire to know everything about Japanese only increases.All Miyazaki's films are wonderful and special, and each of them have deep meanings which only those who try to see it will understand the point of the movies.Spirited Away has colorful, and extremely detailed arts in it, and the characters and their actions made them seem so real! It is a movie about how an immature, ten-year-old girl who, by accident, got into the spirit world with her parents, whom are turned into pigs because of greed. In order to save them, she must become a worker in the bathhouse for Gods. Throughout the movie, you meet interesting and fun characters, such as the tiny dust balls, they're just so cute! Chihiro, the little girl, must learn to be strong in order to survive and rescue her parents with the help of a dragon boy, Haku. The movie is really wonderful and I have seen it many times.I'm really sad to hear from some people that he's not going to produce any of his own anime films any longer. (They are so good!) I really appreciated all his works, and I feel so lucky to get to see many of his movies! May Studio Ghibli live on forever!"
Boba_Fett1138,"Jan 10, 2006",9/10,"What makes this movie so powerful and great are mainly its characters. The characters are well constructed and are mainly the reason why this movie is so unforgettable. Some of the characters are quite odd looking, even by anime standards but they are so wonderfully constructed that they all become believable.The story is just totally brilliant. It's odd but oh so beautiful. The imaginary world gives the movie a totally unique and beautiful look and feeling. It all helps to make ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"" an unique and unforgettable viewing experience. The beauty in the movie is in its unpredictability. Because its so unique and original, you never know what to expect next and everything comes as a pleasant surprise. My only complaint about the story is its love-story, if there even was meant to be one, wasn't really believable and felt underdeveloped and like a missed opportunity.It all is beautiful animated and with lots of eye for detail and I'm talking about both the characters and the imaginary world. It helps to make you believe in the totally imaginary world and the story.The musical score by Joe Hisaishi is just fantastic and fits the movie very well.This is once more another Hayao Miyazaki masterpiece. Once more he has succeeded in creating a unique, original and totally believable world, story and characters. It's both beautiful and unforgettable.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Lupercali,"Jun 19, 2004",10/10,"About ten minutes into 'Spirited Away' you realise that this movie is going to be totally unlike anything you've ever seen before - even the director's previous movies. Half an hour into the the thing, you feel like you're witnessing some sort of collision between Walt Disney and David Lynch. Put simply, 'Spirited Away' is damn weird - sometimes charmingly weird, sometimes excitingly weird, but sometimes just plain old what the hell is a 'stink spirit', and why does it have a bicycle stuck in its side type weird.If you think that is supposed to be criticism, think again. 'Spirited Away' is every bit as incredible as the most incredible things written about it would have you believe. It simply transports you to a meticulously realised universe of spirits and mythology; a world utterly brimming over with fantastical sights and characters. The realisation of this whole mise-en-scene is a monumental cinematic achievement. You come out of the movie really feeling like you've just spent two hours in some incredible parallel universe.The attention to detail is staggering, the surprises endless (and I just mean every damn camera shot has something in it that will make your jaw drop to one extent or another), and somehow through this barrage of unheralded ideas the central character comes through rock solid, as do all of the supporting ones.That isn't to say that characterisation is the movie's long suite. Perhaps it's just a cultural thing, but it seems to me that even the best Japanimation doesn't _quite_ have the Disney capacity to make you fall in love with the characters. Or perhaps you could argue that Disney is just overly sentimental. In any event this is really the only very slight fault I could find with 'Spirited Away' - and it is slight, because there are scenes, particularly in the latter part of the film, which will bring a lump to your throat.One quibble: people keep saying how much better the animation is in this film than in Disney (well, Disney aren't even doing hand-drawn animation anymore, but you know what I mean.) I think they mean that the backgrounds and drawings are better. The animation - literally the movement from frame to frame of the characters - is not up to top notch Disney standards. Watch a car drive along the road in the early part of the film: it is conspicuously jerky, unlike the smooth panoramic, sweeping animation of Disney in the past decade.However, except in those very early scenes, it isn't very noticeable, and even if you did notice it, you would be so gobsmacked by the amazing, almost poetic backdrops in so many of the scenes that you'd soon forget about it.I guess I've picked a few holes in 'Spirited Away', haven't I?  That's why I'm only giving it a meagre 9.5 out of 10.0.It's a masterpiece. See it."
kvala_530,"Apr 19, 2004",10/10,"A wonderful, wonderful movie! You don't often see movies that fill you with warmth and happiness. This is one of them though. I had not too high (but not low) expectations of an animated Japanese movie, but I was soon charmed by the brave little girl Chihiro and fascinated and swept away by her adventures. The characters are complex and there are mysteries that don't get explained in the movie, which is nice for a change. In most children's movies we get to see these days, every thing is laid out bite-sized, and nothing is left unexplained. Spirited away is much more daring in that respect. And with right: children do not need to see everything explained, they can enjoy a story just as much if it is mysterious.I give this movie a 10 because it managed to transport me to a fairy tale world and bring me back happy and content. I still think of it at times, even though it was a while back I saw it."
i-mladen,"Aug 18, 2017",10/10,"Really, don't wanna spoil anything. Go watch it, it will be a significant anime experience. Also it will teach you life lessons which you will always remember and have it as a picture in your mind. That Chihiro girl didn't achieve anything without hard work and great effort. A lot of main characters turn out extremely lucky, well here's one who actually work her ass of to get what she wanted..."
mtgtuga,"Jan 27, 2005",10/10,"Rightfully named the greatest Japanese animation director, Miyazaki delivers again. This movie is definitely his masterpiece. Every single aspect (at least the good ones!) that you could possibly imagine is present and accounted for.After seeing Princess Mononoke, I sincerely believe Miyazaki to be gifted. Be careful in making wrong judgments just because it's an animation (hence a ""kid's movie"" according with the stereotypes); trust me, this movie will puzzle you beyond reason and it's much more effective in doing so than 99% of the so called ""real"" movies. Real life has never been so well depicted.. the story is pure fantasy, but the feelings, speeches, reactions are genuinely human.Perhaps most of you don't know (or just don't care), but every great hero/leader had his doubts, disbelieves and moments of weakness. What made them great, was not the absence of such feelings, but the will power to move forward when every single bone in their body told them to run for cover...And that, my friends, is exactly what this movie is all about.See it. I promise you it's time well spent."
jlms,"Oct 8, 2003",5/10,"Sorry but I don't see the reason of the enthusiasm for this movie. The history line has no head or feet, the escatological scenes get tiresome, the ending is facile and predictable and even hurried. In general it reminds one of the countless drivel that Manga aficionados are so fond of, one more of the apparently unending carbon-copy characters that we have got used to.The movie has a hint of pretentiousness that never really catches on, at the end is more of the same weird idiomatics that every single manga caricature has used to the point of exhaustion: the perfect girl with no fault on her character, the absent parents, the hero that saves her (and that in a convoluted turn of events has saved her before) and the loads of wackos that look mostly repulsive.It is an OK movie for children with strong stomachs (I wonder if their attention could be fixed for this long) but as a cinematographic experience it lacks all the ingredients of a respectable movie."
GRMacE,"Oct 27, 2002",10/10,"This is a not to be missed film if you value imagery.Though the plot is not as engaging and the action a bit slower than ""Princess Monoke"", it makes up for it in its sheer beauty.  It is not a child's movie, but I am certain a 10 to 14 year old will love it.  Think of it as an anime version of ""A Secret Garden"" and you will get my point.Beautiful."
demondog2,"Dec 20, 2003",10/10,"Spirited Away is an amazing movie.  I've been getting so used to animation getting increasingly graphically detailed with computer-aided animation (Beauty and the Beast) or computer animation (Pixar stuff) that I forgot how good simple animation can be.  Like much Japanese artwork, a lot can be said with simple strokes of a brush.  Details here are applied to the areas they are required and not where they are unneeded.  This helps focus the eye and alleviates the nonstop detail that tends to numb you after an hour of a Pixar flick (although I love them all too).I loved the creativity of it.  Since I'm a Westerner, it probably seems even more creative and new to me since I'm not used to dragons and spirits. Accordingly, the color palette seemed unique as well which made the movie seem fresh.I'll agree with what others said about the movie being more of an uncontrolled wild ride rather than a plot, but that was OK for me."
bob the moo,"Sep 21, 2003",N/A,"While on their way to their new house in a new town, Chihiro and her parents take a short cut down a side road and come to a dead end with a dark passage way in a wall.  Despite her fears, Chihiro goes with her parents to see where it leads.  They come out in open space where they find what looks like an abandoned theme park.  Chihiro's parents find a stall with lots of food prepared and start to eat while Chihiro refuses and goes to investigate a working bath house.  As it suddenly gets dark she goes back to her parents to find they have been turned into pigs and suddenly shadows draw over the stalls.  Chihiro hides with the help of a boy called Haku.  He helps her to stay in the bathhouse by getting her a job (as dictated by Yubaba) and she settles into the resort for Japan's gods and spirits.  However she still must work out a way of getting her parents back before they grow fat and are eaten.The first I had heard of this film was when it won the Oscar (sadly this was the one part of my combination bet that I had got wrong and hence won nothing).  Since then the film has had world-wide promotion and arrived in the UK several years after it had first been shown.  Despite the worrying `Walt Disney' legend at the front of the credits, this is very much a Miyazaki film and the mouse has not turned it into something else.  My second worry was that the American team involved in the version I saw would bring out sarcasm in the same way as they (Lasseter) does in things like Monsters Inc etc.  I enjoy that style of humour but `Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi' was much better than just that.The plot involves the quest to recover Chihiro's parents from a spell that made them pigs, but the world in which the film is set is what makes it so enjoyable.  The world is imaginative and filled with all sorts of characters. Chihiro's journey explores themes of understanding, trust and friendship  all around the central quest, and in this way it is good that some parents I know have been taking their kids to see this film even if it isn't tied into a Happy Meal marketing campaign.  The characters are all pretty well developed and are interesting.  Chihiro is afraid but brings bravery from inside herself, Haku is a mystery but appears trustworthy, the mysterious noface could be a friend or foe.  What the film doesn't have is characters who do nothing  they all drive the story forward or provide the comic relief in some way.The American cast do good jobs dubbing the characters.  Usually dubbed films are so poor that I always seek out subtitles, however here the job was as it were meant.  Chase is very good in one of her two Oscar nominated films that year and Mardsen has much more to do than in the X-Men films!  Support voices are all good and involve plenty of recognisable voices such as Chiklis, Holly, Ratzenberger and Stiers.The film is a lot more accessible than much anime  sure there are still monsters and spirits but there are no major battles and way out visuals to deal with, kids can watch this (and should).  In fact I did quite like the simplicity of the tale.  Whereas kids movies recently tend towards the more sarcastic, cruel humour as much for adults, here the film is more about spirit (no pun) and moral courage.  It is also worth noting that, although there is magic, this is not some spectacle film like Harry Potter  Chihiro uses her brain and her heart to deal with things, not spells.The animation is fantastic  while CGI has been used, it never feels as totally computerised as Monster Inc etc does.  This isn't BETTER because it was hand drawn but it does fell a lot warmer and a lot more recognisable in terms of style.  The use of both techniques gives much to the look of the film.  As always the world and the characters come to life on the screen and are fantastic, creepy and beautiful all at once.I don't mean to gush but I did enjoy this film for all it's simplistic plotting.  The quest is a straightforward plot device and would be a problem if that's all this film had to offer.  Happily the central story is supported by characters who are wonderfully drawn (both animated and developed) and set in a world that is visually impressive and imaginative. I looked at my watch and wondered where two hours had gone."
ashliebelle,"Mar 21, 2005",10/10,"Spirited Away is one of those movies that leaves you with a lingering sense of wonder and happiness as the credits roll. It is one of a handful of movies that after the first viewing, I'm ready and willing to watch it again immediately. I am not an anime fan; I watched this simply due to the rave reviews, and I'm so happy that I did. The only problem now is getting others to watch it (""I HATE anime!"" they usually reply.)This is not the anime I thought it would be... ie., no exclamation marks flying from characters' heads, or giant eyes or overly-dramatic reactions. It's much different from the Cartoon Network anime you might catch as you flip channels. It's a real art form. There were moments of beauty that I can't describe, like the camera soaring over the water-covered railroad tracks with the setting sun reflecting off the water.I don't recommend movies on a whim; showing a person a movie is like giving them a gift, so I'm always careful about what movies I show to certain people; I can't think of a single person to whom I wouldn't want to show Spirited Away.If you let yourself get caught up in the magic, it is a magical experience."
Nez205,"Apr 7, 2005",10/10,"What else can I say? It was such an enjoyment to watch. Everything was new, fresh, and surprising. The animation alone set an instant and unique atmosphere. The music matched perfectly, with a drawing sense of mystery. The story was fantastic - a sort of darker, unknown wonderland. The characters were given an abundance of individuality which colored the story with further brilliance. Over all, a classic animation for all ages, which deserves every ounce of praise that is given to it. I highly recommend it to anyone who loves to set their imaginations free into the limitless world of fantasy, where there is always a sense of blissful escape from the rough reality around us."
FlickNomad,"Oct 31, 2002",10/10,"Hayao Miyazaki does it again, but much better then his previous Princess Mononoke. Spirited Away is a highly imaginative movie that does things that you can only find in the best children's fantasy books, but don't let that stop you if your an adult. At over 2 hours, it's epic-like, and requires a bit of attention.(And besides, there's a chunk or two of some scary parts that would give a 7 year old nightmares)It follows the adventures of a young girl, Chihiro, in a spirit world, where she must fight to save her parents. Consequently, she must then look for work, as it is the only way she could survive in this other world. But the type of job that she will handle isn't going to be easy, and she will have to prove herself more then once. The characters she meets are so full of life, so amusing and colorful, it's hard to peel your eyes from the screen because you might miss something pretty amazing. It reminded me of Never Ending Story, Alice in Wonderland, and perhaps Time Bandits, and yet, it's completely original.It's gorgeous to look at. Just as you think you will see the same thing on the next scene, it gets more dramatic, and the colors are handled beautifully. The dubbing is outstanding. And the movie stayed with me long after I saw it. It's a shame that Disney, who's distributing this in the US over from Japan, doesn't push this movie more. As of this writing, it's open in very few theaters, even though it's made millions outside BEFORE it came to the US. Regardless, this is a movie that you should hunt for and travel to go see. I await the DVD to become part of my library. Yes, it is that good.Rating: 10 out of 10"
kgaffoor,"Apr 4, 2020",6/10,"The aesthetics of the animation is great. The story is somewhat unique. I'm just slightly annoyed that I spent two hours watching this, Constantly waiting for it to get better. Here's a tip, if you think it's below average in the first 30 minutes, don't bother finishing it. It doesn't really pick up. Maybe it's because I don't understand Japanese and read the English subtitles. I just really didn't find this to be great. I've made a point of watching the IMDB top 30 movies and this is honestly the first one where I'm a bit confused as to how it got here."
laxcat,"Oct 26, 2002",10/10,"I smiled the whole movie through. Some smiles were from laughter, some were from enchantment. Many were accompanied with a cocked eyebrow marveling at the bizarreness of it all, but most of my smiles were those of the child inside, for I can't remember the last movie that has been so simply wonderful.This movie's shining praise lies in its ability to stir up enchantment inside even the crankiest cynic. You'll leave the theater feeling eight years old.Yet giggling at mystical creatures' cuteness doesn't begin to fully define this movie's depth. Those who prefer to keep their inner child under lock and key will still appreciate this movie's gorgeous animation, and simply unbelievable strangeness.Like all timeless fairy tales, Spirited Away casts a spell on eyes and ears of all ages."

Illymovies,"Mar 10, 2008",10/10,"I only recently saw Spirited Away and I was extremely pleased with it. I searched out some of the negative comments out of curiosity to see what possibly could some people NOT like about this movie. Most reasons pointed to the lack of character development and the lack of a real story that made sense. In other words they expected something that fits perfectly together as often happens in all Disney movies. Not to say that Disney movies are bad, they're just different, they're very simplistic and offer nothing more than an hour's worth of entertainment. Spirited Away blew me away, all the motifs were portrayed so carefully and subtly and with such amazing animation visuals. It combined elements of many classical popular stories that I myself was familiar with and thus able to enjoy. It is probable that individuals exposed only to the Disney ""culture"" which comes very very close to no culture at all is negatively surprised by this movie. For everybody else who is familiar with coming of age stories, and other stories rich with fables and with lessons will see the lessons and motifs portrayed in Spirited Away and will not JUST look for a plot line and character development, but will see beyond that to discover that the plot was fantastic and there was also plenty of character development. For those of you who haven't seen this feature I wish you GOOD viewing! Do see this film on a rainy Sunday afternoon."
midrac,"Apr 1, 2006",10/10,"I normally dislike anime as an animation style (one of the only animation styles is don't like actually). However, this movie is great. One of the reasons being that this is an animated movie using the techniques of the western industry, i.e. enough frames to avoid the fact that it seems to be a sequence of stills.Then there is the story, which is innovative in a way which one only sees once every few years (Shrek, Ice Age,...) and not one which recurs every two weeks (dragonball, ...)What is very attractive also is the technique used to show ghosts and spirit in a slightly sfumato style.Super story en superb animation."
shava23,"Oct 31, 2002",10/10,"Spirited Away makes Alice in Wonderland look like an older man's conceit -- Alice pokes fun at the adult world of an Oxford don, but Spirited Away brings us into the first person sensibilities of a ten year old girl.  I remember that world.This is the only movie that has out-grossed Titanic at the box office in Japan, and it deserves more notice from all ages in the US and abroad.Unlike his previous release, Princess Mononoke, this film avoids exposition, and simply immerses you in the same world of internal logic and magic that the heroine Chihiro must navigate.  This is the world of children coming into their own in the world -- the real world is equally an environment where they must discover rules, discover who holds power, discover their own virtue and honor.Spirited Away simply gives us a fantasy setting for the reality of a child.This is a visually lovely, imaginative, intelligent film that will please people of all ages (perhaps above six or so -- some of the kami may be too odd and scary for small children).It is a favorite for me, and for my 9 year old son Joseph."
SolidSnake86XX,"Sep 28, 2003",9/10,"Well, what a surprise; ""Miyazaki"" and ""masterpiece"" together in an affirmative sentence.  Spirited Away marks Miyazaki's first work as a semi-retired director, though the movie doesn't suffer from it in the least. Spirited Away is about a young girl gets lost in a world of ghosts and spirits and is forced to work at the bath house for specters.  Any fan of Miyazaki will instantly fall in love with this movie.  Don't be fooled by Disney's involvement or the fact that it's animated.  It's still very much anime, but not anime for anyone.  This is a good movie for young children and those who have a timeless love for movies.  If you're the kind of person who still loves Toy Story, for example, then this will become another one of your favorites.  People who are only into anime like Ninja Scroll and Cowboy Beebop, this may not be the movie for you.  This is a movie for those who love anime of all kinds, like myself.  Spirited Away is a fanciful movie that most open-minded individuals will enjoy.  I'd have to give it a 9.25 out of 10."
bellavox,"Mar 25, 2006",7/10,"I was really looking forward to seeing this film, and was really disappointed by it. I agree with the user who commented that the English dubbed voices are just plain awful, especially the main character Chihiro/Sen, whose voice the user described as ""like nails on a chalkboard."" I realized that I was SUPPOSED to feel really sorry for this little girl's plight and worried about her fate, but quite frankly, all her screeching and crying really got on my nerves to the point that I began to wish she really would be ""spirited away"" - off my screen! I have seen and loved other movies by this director, and I intend to find a copy of this particular film in the subtitled version, so that I can give it another chance. I'm sure then I will fall in love with it as I have the others."
cassandra_blakeney,"Aug 30, 2004",N/A,"Wow. Just wow. I'm completely blown away by how amazing this film was. For a while now I've had an urge to watch it even though I had no clear idea of what it was. I was under the impression that it was a present-day Anime version of Alice in Wonderland. Lucky me it turned out to be completely different considering I can't stand Alice in Wonderland.I think the most prominent reason why this movie hits you so deeply is because its real. If I wasn't constantly thinking ""Oh my gosh, the animation is so beautiful..."" I probably would have forgotten its cartoon-status completely. Little things like the way Chihiro's hair moved when she walked, the expressions and body language put forth from everyone. I can hardly believe that the artists were able to capture that.Then there's the story, which is just magical beyond all belief. I started watching this movie at midnight and sat quietly on my bed, spell-bound, for the next two hours as the movie played out. I've never watched a movie that could hold me so avidly the entire time.Of course you have to comment on the whole spiritual journey Chihiro goes through while she is on her physical journey. Essentially, she starts out as an annoying brat and ends up as a less annoying not-really-a-brat. That sounds pretty negative, but Chihiro was a little annoying sometimes. Then again, kids her age do tend to annoy me in real life so she was obviously portrayed realistically. Oh well, you have to love her anyway.This was a magnificent movie. I don't intend to give it back to the person I borrowed it from any time soon. What are you waiting for? Go watch it!"
evergreengrad,"Dec 11, 2006",10/10,"Up until the time I viewed this film, I equated the phrase ""Japanese animation"" with phrases like ""Pokemon,"" ""Digimon,"" and other ""mon's,"" that made me want to vomit. Hayao Miyazaki has really opened my eyes and made me realize just how wrong I really was.The story opens with our hero, Chihiro, an apathetic, whiny little brat voiced brilliantly by Daveigh Chase, as she's moving to a new house. Her parents (Lauren Holly, Michael Chiklis) make a classic, horror-movie boo-boo by taking an alternate path. This lands them an abandoned amusement park. Chihiro wanders off. She then finds that what seems to be an amusement park is, in actuality, a bathhouse for the gods, and her parents, having helped themselves to the local buffet, have been turned into pigs. Left to her own devices, she has to give herself a personality overhaul in order to survive. Along the way, she meets colorful characters, such as Yubaba (voiced by Suzanne Pleschette,) her good-natured lackey Haku (James Marsden)and one of the cleaning girls (Susan Egan.) Miyazaki, who gave us films like Princess Mononoke and Porco Rosso, has given us what could very possibly be the greatest animated film, ever. Complete with rich, well-rounded characters and breath-taking animation, this could aptly be described as a modern day Alice in Wonderland."
FogelNo1,"Oct 17, 2002",N/A,"I, like most people, came to know Miyazaki's films by Princess Mononoke. When I heard of this film's release, I was beyond excited. I didn't expect it to beat Mononoke, but I expected it to be really good. I was mistaken. It is better than Mononoke. It isn't really good, it's an animation masterpiece. I was in tears, not because the movie was moving, or happy, but because I had never had such fun in a movie theater.Spirited Away is brilliant and vibrant, filled with the characters that nightmares and dreams are formed from. The animation is eye-popping to say the least...not just in color, sophistication or texture, but in MOVEMENT. The film flows like water, not like the stiff stone-like characters seen in most anime films, such as Ghost in the Shell or Jin-Roh. The film itself is so magnificently well-played...nobody in the film is really evil, but every step of the way is exciting.As for the dubbing, it was excellent...while ALL other anime films looked so silly in their dubbed forms, I think this film is nearly perfect...there were maybe one or two moments in the film when I was reminded that I was watching it in a different language than its original form.As a lover of fine cinema, animation plays a small, but vital, role in my passion. Spirited Away is amongst the best films in the medium...Miyazaki has proven himself to be a film-maker of diverse talent, and has launched himself into the first decade of a new millenium with a movie that is nothing less than timeless."
spellingimpared,"Feb 22, 2005",10/10,"Spirited away is a movie which can only truly be described a Wack! Yes I know this is not a word and I understand it is not even proper English however it is the only term which can thoroughly describe the movie. It is a film which is immensely entertaining and full of scenes which are just playing fun to watch. However, you must be warned. In between the incredibly detailed animations, there is an almost never ending mythological plot (this lack of realism irked some of my friends). There are creatures and monsters, heroes and villains, none of which are as they first appear. It has everything a movie should have however there is no guarantee you will like it. If Spirited away has one fault it is its length. At 2 hours it is a killer for those with short attention spans (I did however make it through and in the end was glad I did). When going into the movie if you can go in with an open mind purely with the desire to be entertained then spirited away is a movie well worth seeing; however, if you are one to find fantasy and cartoons dull and nonsensical then find another movie."

earlsleek,"Jul 15, 2003",10/10,"I don't tell you this particularly to sell the movie, but maybe to come to grips with how utterly HAUNTING this movie is to me, and I'm still trying to figure out why.  I bought the DVD before I'd ever seen it (and didn't even watch it for a few days), but once I hit ""Play"" I've been hooked ever since. I have trouble going three days without watching it, and I'm enlisting my friends to watch the movie, but secretly so that I can have an excuse to watch it again.  I'll watch it dubbed or subtitled, it doesn't matter. I'm sick, and I don't want to get well.Story?  Great.  Animation?  Stellar.  But that shouldn't be enough to enslave me to Miyazaki's vision.  What then keeps me coming back?  Well, I have one theory...There's something about Chihiro that is utterly real, moreso than an in-the-flesh actress, even.  The way she runs, or cries, or sulks, or clings to her mother, I don't know how Miyazaki captured it all, but as Chihiro grows, I feel like I'm growing with her.  To me, that's why it's cheap to compare SA to Wizard of Oz or Alice in Wonderland; Dorothy and Alice are flat characters, while Chihiro is in my eyes a genuine 10-year-old child. My heart roots for Chihiro.Yeah, maybe I'm lame, but I'll tell you this.  When I think about Hollywood's cookie-cutter punchline movies these days, I barely even feel temptation to attend.  Why sit through the latest mediocrity (or sequel to mediocrity), when I can just throw SA back in the DVD player and get my guaranteed movie magic?My name's earlsleek, and I'm an SA junkie."

Sinnerman,"Oct 28, 2002",10/10,"I don't get it.Someone should forward the many positive IMDB user comments here to Disney. I can't help but feel there has been a blatantly mishandled distribution strategy for this film in the US of A.Despite its near 100% critical praises and its massive US$200 million box office take even before its American release, Spirited Away is still playing in less than 100 theatres nation wide, which caused it to undeservedly languish in the lower reaches of the American movie charts even as we speak.There has been much speculative criticism over Disney conspiratorial mishandling of Mayazaki's last film, the classic Princess Mononoke. It has since been disproved as an urban legend and the benefit of the doubt was given to Disney. How could it be possible that a company like Disney would willingly sacrifice profits for a greater aim of secretly smothering Mayazaki films for fear of adversely affecting its own vault of animated films?Sadly, the present state for ""Spirited Away"" will definitely be re-surrecting this previously dispelled conspiracy theory. Unless the marketing/ distribution strategy for Spirited Away is revamped completely (i.e. a massive `Toy Story like' promotional campaign followed by a well deserved wide release relaunch), this lingering tainted image for the mouse company and Hollywood at large will likely remain.You heard it here first. Expose Hollywood for what it is, a sinister oligopolistic business enterprise with hidden agendas of buying up distribution and remake rights of worthy Asian films, so as to smother them and minimise their chances of American success, thereby safeguarding their own selfish financial and market interest.Its so disgustingly evil it makes me sick."
artkozak,"Dec 10, 2004",10/10,"Even if you're not yet a manga addict, you'll be seduced by lovely Chihiro, the Witch sisters, the majestic cursed Dragon and a very odd Dark Spirit. You'll meet with the most surprising monsters and still have a background vibe of the Japanese world of politeness, Geishas and Tea Houses. That mix is so imaginative and so full of poetry that it will find the child in you. However, it isn't quite a usual manga storyline (not much fighting going on). It leaves you lighthearted and inspired! It is one of the most engaging movies I have EVER seen.A must see!"
nabina-mitra,"May 8, 2004",10/10,"The tale of the Chihiro, the small girl who finds her self in a strange and daunting spirit world working to save her parents and return them all to the world from which they have come. Not knowingly seen or heard of Miyazaki's work before ( although it takes a few times for a name to penetrate my consciousness), I was without preconceptions about the film apart from my friend's ""It's really good!"" as she handed the DVD to me as a birthday present. I have to agree with her. This film rocked. Appealing, I should say to many age groups, (I saw it with my mum and some 30 something year old friends), it in turn scared, startled, moved me, made me smile and laugh and warmed the deepest cockless of my heart. This has everything from adventure and mythology(Japanese of course) to friendship and love. I was with the little girl and her friends every step of the way. It is a bizzare film but very watchable and completely enchanting. The animation is much softer than the usual Japanese Manga style of cartoon, and the tale certainly not as bloody. (Barely bloody at all) I saw the American dubbed version and the Japanese, subtitled version one after the other, and I prefered the latter. A good film, when well subtitled, leaves you with the feeling of actually having heard the characters say the words in English, and this was the case with this film. The translation in the 2 versions were not the same and to me some of the subtleties in the Japanese version were lost in the American version were there was the added pressure of having to syncronise the words to(cartoon)lip movement. There were also some cultural adaptions from the Japanese version to better suit an American audience, which I prefered without.  Having said that, the American(English) version stands successfully in it's own right. My friends(& mum)who only watched the American version thoroughly enjoyed it. The DVD extras such as interviews with Miyazaki and the American director/producer? and the lead up to the Japanese release made fun watching too. Some of it just to get a little peek into the life/hard work/mad stresses behind making the film. I gave it a 10."

andrz2,"Apr 1, 2004",N/A,"I loved this movie. It allowed me to relive the wonder and edge-of-your-seat-excitement I experienced in my childhood when I watched another similar movie, The Neverending Story (Die Unendliche Geschichte). Watching Spirited Away awakened in my an almost insatiable appetite to see Neverending Story again. Although, unlike Miyazaki wondrous creation, it's German and older, although it's not animated and the special fx are a bit ""dated"", although it's about the coming of age of a little boy and not a little girl, the two movies are so much alike that when I watched it I had the feeling that Miyazaki's masterpiece is in fact the actualized Japanese version  of this movie... The escapist premise is essentially identical: 2 children find an exit door from the mundane, from the rollerink, one through a hallway in an crying citadel, the other through a book. Both have parents too absorbed by themselves and their problems who don't have enough time for their kids' problems. In both movies self-sacrifice is a condition for survival and return to the real world. And let us not forget the friendly flying dragon which appears in both movies and is in essence a spermatozoid with the head of a labrador golden retriever... ;^) Still, I have to admit that while the Neverending Story's symbols are quite accessible, Miyazaki's symbols are much more vague. German clarity permeates through Neverending Story, while the Japanese coexistence of sharp contrasts is prevalent in Spirited Away. Still, both are colossal monuments dedicated to imagination and creativity, and if that's what you like, you shouldn't skip watching this movie!"
itsmaisoup,"Apr 19, 2005",10/10,This movie was touching when I saw it.. I believe this film has taken a lot of breath out of Miyazaki and well it certainly took mine. If you want a good family movie I definitely suggest this one. If you are not into weirdness and being strange this is not your movie.. Well done Miyazaki!!! A short summary: About a young girl who has parents and her trapped in the spirit world and tries to save herself. On the way she finds friends that will help her find her way home and later discover what they have lost too. This movie has won countless awards and nominations and I believe actually deserves them...... Spirited Away is one of Miyazaki's very best!
ccthemovieman-1,"Oct 25, 2006",8/10,"How many people can sit through a 120-minute animated film? That's normally just too long for that genre. However, this one could meet that challenge. It only took me two sittings to make it all the way - that's very good, at least for me!The best part of the film was the color, stunning in parts, beautiful and with great detail. It also had some wild characters and a bit of humor here and there, which helped. Overall, a good mix of good and evil and a different kind of story.Being it's Japanese, you are going to get some different theology than you are accustomed to in the West (""the spirits of the wind and water have healed you,"" etc.) but it's not presented in a heavy-handed manner.I was concerned early on as the young girl - the main character in the film - had a shrill voice that was not pleasant but she calmed down after the first part of the film.Overall, entertaining and worth several looks."
tj_director,"Aug 14, 2003",10/10,"I either post a review when i loathe a film, or feel a film has been unfairly dissed.. but in this case it's because i completely adored it.I think Miyazaki is a genius, i really do, people compare the story to Wizard Of Oz or Alice In Wonderland, and they are very similar in content, a fantastic new world, and a young girl who must learn more about herself and others to leave, and just like those 2 stories this one if FULL of imagination, every single minute is filled with something new and fresh, borrowing from Japanese mythology as well as Miyazaki's previous creations (i.e. the adorable soot creatures), it ranges from the surreal to the sublime. The story can be written on a post it note, yet my biggest flaw with the film is that is a good half hour too short! i simply didn't want the film to stop.. but i suppose that was the whole point of being spirited away...I think there are people who might find things a bit too wierd and tripped out, but they can't deny the overall message of the film, it isn't some huge life changing event that the hype makes it feel to be, it is just one of the most amazing films ever made, there is a beautiful subtlely to it all.. it doesn't have some mad epic grandouise adventure plot, there are no mega set pieces, no songs or big numbers, the film is mostly set in one building, there are times when you don't know where the story is going, or if there is any.. but this is a common feeling in Miyazaki films, they aren't about getting those pre-set highs or step by step film structure.. they are more about escaping to another world and being a part of it.. which is in my mind the greatest single thing a film or book can do... and this film achieves it, by the end you will be moved, maybe not to streaming tears, but you will feel something..this film will mean something to everyone! a genuine masterpiece :)"
Paintchain,"Jun 11, 2005",9/10,"Yeah... Spirited Away, or Sen to Chihiro as they call it here. My DVD said Spirited Away. It's a Dutch version with Dutch dubs and original Japanese language on it. Also there are Dutch subs. I've only watched Japanese with Dutch subs. Two times. Yes... It was such a great films from Studio Ghibli's living legend Hayao Miyazaki. I love all his films. And I like most of the other films from Studio Ghibli too. Like Grave of the Fireflies... it's such a drama, really beautiful. But right... this is Spirited Away. It's a great film. You get a nice feeling when you watch it. It's a little bit dramatic, but you won't get down of it. It's some fantasy. There are creatures in it, like ghost. You won't see the difference between good and evil, 'cause the line between that is really vague. Some things look bad, but are good. It's a film who's loved by young and old. Even adults can enjoy the deep lying thoughts in it. I really recommit this. If you have watched this and liked it, but want some more action, you can try Princess Mononoke. It's also a Ghiblifilm, but with some more action. And if you haven't watched it yet, have fun!"

I finally managed to watch the film recently and I was not dissapointed at all!The animation is superb, the colours are breathtaking, you simply cant look away! The whole film is beautiful!For fans of anime it is a must see, but I urge all movie fans to see it as I believe most would definitely enjoy it. I watched the movie with the original japanese dialogue accompanied by english subtitles and I certainly prefer watching these films in that format than with a crappy dubbed english soundtrack.I give this film a rating of 9/10"
0rganism,"Jan 18, 2004",9/10,"Some movies you just have to see to believe.  Spirited Away is one of them. Now I'm something of an anime/manga fan, but my wife is definitely not, and she LOVED this movie.  My young son also has become something of a Miyazaki fan, thanks to the DVDs of his movies.  (We now give a rousing ""Studio Ghibli"" cheer at the beginning of this and other Miyazaki films.)My wife and I saw Spirited Away in a theatre, and unlike some japanimation I've seen, this does belong on a large screen.  However, it might be too intense for younger viewers.  It translates quite well to DVD, so no complaints there, but the amazing color pallete and generally high artistic quality deserve a vivid presentation.I've heard and read complaints that some of the themes were too culturally-specific, that it would be impossible for an American unversed in Japanese mythology to understand the film.  Well, that suits me just fine; I rather like the sense of strangeness that comes with not quite knowing how all the themes tie together.  Perhaps it helped me identify with the main character, Chihiro, who as a young girl used to a technological society certainly isn't in a position to know the details of bathhouses for spirits.I really enjoyed the notion that if one goes just a little off the beaten track of modern Japan, one finds beautifully anachronistic spirit worlds. Fortunately, we didn't have to go too far afield to find Miyazaki's beautiful flight of fancy.  This film succeeds as a morality play on the pitfalls of carelessness and greed, as a comment on the persistence of deep cultural roots despite technological homogenization, and as an inspirational fairy tale of a girl who has to accept her extremely peculiar lot for the sake of her family.Impressive. 9/10."
Leofwine_draca,"Apr 4, 2013",6/10,"SPIRITED AWAY is a well-regarded Studio Ghibli animation about a young girl's adventures in a fantastic netherworld filled with all manner of strange and terrifying creations. While it packs more imagination into one movie than ten Disney cartoons, it feels a little aimless and meandering, in search of a decent storyline to go along with the madcap creations.In terms of visual spectacle, at times this is as good as it gets for an anime: every scene features all kind of kooky, uniquely-crafted monsters and creatures. My favourite has to be the three bouncing heads. Unfortunately, the protagonist - a sullen little girl - turns out to be rather irritating and her journey to greater understanding is slow and over obvious.I'm inclined to like these Ghibli movies, but SPIRITED AWAY is no classic; it starts well and tails off, with a stodgy middle and better ending. So far, my favourites are those that take place in the 'real' world - like GRAVE OF THE FIREFLIES and PONYO - rather than those that exist in a fantasy landscape, like this and the overrated PRINCESS MONONOKE."
eroginsk,"Aug 2, 2005",8/10,"In Spirited Away, Hayao Miyazaki creates a color-saturated world filled with interesting characters, magical creatures. The colors in the movie are stunning in their variety. The movie's animator has an interesting way of showing light and shadow, making it seem more cinematic than cartoonish, and Miyasaki shows a great attention to detail in every image he creates. The movie centers on Chihiro, who is a whiny, sullen girl whose family is moving. Chihiro does not want to move, and she makes her opinions well-known. Her whining does not stop when her father decides to take a shortcut to their new home and encounters what he believes to be an abandoned theme park, which is really a bathhouse for spirits to get away to. Chihiro is essentially orphaned in the spirit world when her parents partake of some food that's been left out in preparation for the ghostly guests, and the parents' greed turns them, quite literally, into pigs. It is interesting that Chihiro is the one who warns her family to not go into this seemingly abandoned place and to not eat the food because the viewer believes that Chihiro is just being surly and childish, when really it appears that she has had some special insight (another image of the child as seer). She has not been turned into a pig, and it is her quick thinking and the help of a stranger that just might help her family get out of the mess they have fallen into. Chihiro must then grow up quickly, start becoming more courageous, showing strength and determination. The movie seems to be imparting some very specific lessons to its viewers. Indeed, there is a big focus on manners, ""Aren't' you even going to knock? You're the most pathetic girl I've ever seen"" is one of the lines uttered, and ""Anyone can see you are a lazy, spoiled brat with no manners,"" is another telling piece of dialogue. Chihiro is constantly being reminded to say ""yes, ma'am"" and ""no, ma'am."" Additionally, Chihiro's gluttonous parents get turned into pigs for their mistakes. Also, greedy people get eaten by the dark spirit that crashes the bath house. The movie, however, does seem to send somewhat of a mixed message because Chihiro appears to be bratty when she complains that her parents shouldn't stop when they do, and yet she is right that they shouldn't have trespassed and that they should have stayed away from food that wasn't meant for them. On the other hand, through her experiences in the spirit world, she matures, becoming more self-sufficient, empathetic, and responsible. She is only able to achieve these great human characteristics because her parents have failed to follow the very codes the movie seems to be promoting, like respect and restraint."
andrewroy-04316,"Mar 18, 2019",7/10,"Spirited Away is both a beautiful to watch animated movie and gives the viewer plenty of ideas and symbols to ponder, but the story itself and particularly its conclusions left me ready to move on. I have the utmost respect for animation studios and Studio Ghibli after watching Spirited Away. Miyazaki puts in so many small visual details that immerse you in the spirit world and make it so much more realistic. In terms of the story itself, I found it inconsistent. There are plenty of great themes and ideas to consider, the two that stood out most to me being greed vs kindness in the characters, and the older, more naturalistic mindset clashing with the materialistic, capitalistic modern mindset. Chihiro is a fun protagonist who avoids one-dimensionality, having both a multifaceted personality and an arc that significantly shows her character develop throughout.
Where the story broke down for me was in several of the plot events and details of the world. Simply put, I found the ending to be deus ex machina and an overly simplistic and easy way to solve what had seemed like big, complex challenges. I didn't buy her sudden love with Haku and the way their relationship transitioned from a caring friendship to quite committed love. I also didn't find the addition of Yubaba's twin to make any sense, she felt like a superfluous character added in as a weird twist. The way she got her parents back felt completely absurd and was when I accepted that it just isn't a great movie. In addition to these and other plot frustrations, maybe it was an intentional choice to make the spirit world feel whimsical and ambiguous, but the lack of clarity in how the world functions limited my enjoyment. Are all of them spirits? How many of them are being held there against their will (like Haku)? What is the true motivation of all the spirits? How do the spirits interact with the physical world, and how do their transformations and magical powers work? I found many underlying workings of the spirit world to be unclear in addition to plot points that were either contrived or superfluous. I definitely enjoyed watching it and I do like the consistent, immersive feel of the movie from a young girl discovering this wild world perspective, but the exposition and later plot events didn't completely satisfy me."

Da Cunha 11,"Feb 10, 2004",9/10,"Spirited Away - Sen to Chihiro no Kamikakushi - 2001 Every year there's a handful of films that manage to take flight and cross international boundaries with massive success and translate to a truly international audience. In 2003 Hayao Miyazaki's Animated Masterpiece, Spirited Away, washed up on British shores to an audience who took it in and loved it as the beautiful ghost world tale it was meant to be. This is an 'Alice in Wonderland' like tale, of a young girl who's parents are turned in to pigs while exploring and enjoying the cuisine of a seemingly abandoned theme park. Chihiro remains trapped in this theme park, that after darkness, becomes a surreal world belonging to a collection of ghost and beasts. Chihiro settles down as best she can in this parallel word, as she befriends many characters, and searches for her parents. While the story line may be a little disjointed, the visual imagery of this film makes up for any faults. From the eccentric and eclectic characters, to the serene and stunning landscapes through which Chihiro journeys. This is thanks mainly to the fact that Miyazaki has combined hand drawn and computerised animation, to good effect. It successfully presents a film in a medium usually reserved for kids, but makes it encapsulating for both adult and child alike. Spirited away is certainly one of the most surreal and beautiful films I've seen. 9/10"

So when a friend threw a copy of Spirited Away in my hands and said, ""You've gotta watch this!"" I was less than thrilled, but decided to give it a try.I'm glad I did.The little girl in the movie is made to seem very real. She has all the mannerisms and quirks of a normal, bratty little girl. She is suddenly cast into a surreal world of spirits in which she must be brave and take care of herself.The unique characters and fascinating artwork make this fun to watch. These aren't your stereotypical cutesy anime characters either. The film really branches out and has diverse characters that keep you guessing.If I can think of anything negative about this movie, it might have run on a few minutes too long, but that's a small point, and can easily be overlooked.So, I'm still not going to rush out and watch all the anime films I can, but for those of you who (like me) have decided that you don't care for anime, allow this to be the rare exception.9 of 10"
kamikazeboy,"Jan 3, 2002",10/10,"JAPANESE anime, with its stylish combination of post-apocalyptic visions, babes, violence and gore, has broken from cult status to mainstream outside of Japan in recent years.But viewers expecting the usual dose of babes and bombs will get a surprise in Spirited Away. This animated movie, the highest-grossing in Japanese film history, is written and directed by the best-kept secret of Japanese animation - the legendary Hayao Miyazaki.His unique blend of restrained pastoral scenes, lushly rendered in traditional hand-drawn animation style, and stories flavoured with a strong social conscience, presents a more lyrical side of Japanese animation.Four years in the making, Spirited Away is destined for classic status.The heroine of the story is 10-year-old Chihiro. When the movie opens, she is sulking in the back of her family car as they are on their way to a new home. Things take a strange turn, however, when her father drives into an overgrown lane that takes the family to what seems to be a deserted theme park.Chihiro's parents help themselves to some food, and are turned into pigs. And she finds herself trapped in an alternate world ruled by the evil sorceress Yubaba.Forced to be independent, Chihiro survives by working in Yubaba's exotic bath house, patronised by Japanese gods. She is aided in her quest to cure her parents by Haku, a human boy who is Yubaba's magical apprentice.The story follows the usual template of children's stories where a young protagonist learns resourcefulness in a crisis and matures into a better person.Chihiro's plight is familiar to those who have read Alice In Wonderland and The Wizard Of Oz. The sorceress Yubaba bears a distinct resemblance to the Russian folk witch Baba Yaga.But told in true Miyazaki style, Spirited Away unfolds like a magical carpet ride through the man's generous imagination.The first lure is, quite simply, tactile. Miyazaki's hand-drawn style is lusciously detailed, providing a dizzying treat for the eyes.The theme park boasts authentic architecture from various periods of Japanese history. The bath house brims with gorgeous interiors. And the lovingly-created, entirely charming gods and monsters who totter around this magical world put Pokemon's assembly-line crude scratchings to shame.But above and beyond the visual splendour, Miyazaki is a storyteller non-pareil.Chihiro's emotional journey is told with sensitivity and her character develops with an authentic ring of heartfelt truthfulness that would be admirable in a live action movie, and doubly amazing an accomplishment in an animated movie.Miyazaki is often compared to Walt Disney by a Western press looking for a convenient soundbite introduction.Although there are truly hilarious comedic bits in this movie as well as sidekicks aplenty, there is nary a singing teapot in shouting distance. The only music is a poetic folk song - just a voice with a samisen accompaniment worth sitting through the end credits for.What has earned Miyazaki a loyal adult following is also the fact that his movies are thinly-disguised allegories. His last movie, Princess Mononoke, was a fable with an ecological message.Spirited Away comments on everything from a forgotten Japan - the old world filled with gods, manners and more gracious customs - to the new materialism - represented by the No Face monster, plagued by insecurity and loneliness, who buys friendship with gold.But these metaphors are handled with subtle delicacy, so that they can either be ignored at no expense to the story, or read for enrichment to the tale's already strong emotional core.Miyazaki's movies are anchored in Japanese animist beliefs, flavoured by the culture and history of the country and steeped in its minimalist aesthetic.This last aspect has perhaps denied Miyazaki the mass appeal he so richly deserves. In a world brought up on the frenetic pacing and exploding shades of a Technicolored, Dolby-surround sound musical Disney world, Miyazaki's muted lyricism and gentle pacing takes getting used to.But allow yourself to be spirited away, and there are great rewards in store. You will not regret this trip."
Nephilim-6,"Aug 1, 2003",9/10,"While Nausicaa is better this movie is a vast monument in animation. Therefor I find it an insult when people say something like Ice Age is better. sure Ice Age has pretty visuals but it does not have the depth and spirituality of Spirited Away.However I cannot really blame most comments since most people don't really know Japanese culture other than Sushi, hightech gadgets,  Dragonball Z and Pokemon.The thing with Spirited Away is that it delves deep into the spiritual side of Japanese culture. To Japanese people all things contain spirits. Hence all the gods and spirits in this movie. there's a lot of symbolism in this movie as well. And a lot of life lessons.And what I find really important: it doesn't try to be a kiddy movie but more a family movie. Western people often seem to view animation as something only for kids. In Japan this is simply not true. Animation is for everyone. It provides an escape and a way to create outragious stories that would not have been able to be created through normal film.i love it. I found it hard at first but after seeing it again all the puzzle pieces fell into place.Still I do have some isues with the film. Actually only 1. the ending was too swift. It should have been worked out a little bit more.Other than that wonderful wonderful movie.oh and btw (comment to one reviewer) watch the original japanese language version with subtitles. Chihiro does NOT have a high pitched voice. The whole ide of Dubbing in itself I find ludicrous."
bernie720,"Jul 26, 2006",10/10,"I give this movie a ten for a lot of reasons. First of, Spirited Away is about a girl named Chihiro who goes thru a tunnel and finds herself in a world full of spirits, witches, and people who can transmit themselves into different creatures. It's also about the love between two kids who save each other's life in different times and places.I have seen this movie when it first came out on DVD, and even now I'll say it's the best movie I've ever seen in my whole life. I still have the DVD packed right in my room in a place I'll remember where it is so I can watch it over and over again.Spirited Away is kind of one of those movies that at the end you have this gulp in your throat and how many times you watch it, you'll want to cry. Well in my opinion, I say this movie is better than the Titanic.I really recommend this movie for everyone to see, no matter what age you are (take me as an example) because this is definitely a good movie by Miyazaki."
sarahclayton17,"Jul 19, 2005",10/10,"I first watched this film at chance, just sat watching TV when i flicked onto it, even though i had missed the beginning of the film i watched the majority of it and after watching it that once i had to buy it! I rushed out the next day to find and buy it which i gladly did to sit and watch properly. The animation was fantastic, i have never much been into anime but this film swiftly changed my mind. The different characters were all so capturing especially Kamaji! The story line was brilliant and I grew to love everything about this film very quickly and there is nothing about it i could even think to change! I soon showed it too my friends and they grew just as attached to it as myself! I recommend it too everyone, especially those who don't think anime is to their liking! It will soon change your mind!"
Xiuuy,"Aug 16, 2022",7/10,"So, is it insinuating that the bathhouse is actually a brothel?How on earth did Chihiro know that her parents were not in the pigpen?Had she known the white dragon?"
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 18, 2016",10/10,"Ten-year-old Chihiro Ogino is a spoiled unhappy girl moving with her parents to the countryside. Her father takes a wrong turn and ends up in front of the entrance to an abandoned theme park. They walk through a tunnel, across a dry artificial stream, and find one operating food booth. Her parents can't find anybody but starts eating anyways. She refuses and walks off when she meets a boy called Haku. He implores her to leave across the water before nightfall. She's too late and the dry riverbed becomes a vast river. The park becomes inhabited by spirits. Haku sends her to boiler-man Kamaji and tells her to beg for a job with the ruthless witch Yubaba who runs the magical bathhouse.This is possibly the first Hayao Miyazaki I saw and in my opinion still his best. He's done plenty of great work but this is the pinnacle. It's a simple coming-of-age story but filled with magic and wonder. It added to the language of animated cinema."
ryankoch-93340,"Apr 12, 2022",7/10,"Looks amazing and kind of a fun trip with weird stuff going on, but I didn't really understand the meaning of it. A big baby some monster in a hot tub and more weird stuff happening. Maybe I'm just not smart enough to understand the deep meaning. Not sure why this movie is ranked higher than other animated classics tbh."
prpino,"Apr 17, 2003",4/10,"I'm sorry, but this movie is slow, boring and even stupid. a thousand of idiots creatures don´t make a good film. I think that it's the most overrated film of 2002. ¿8'7?  ¿the best animation film ever made?......JAJAJAJAJAJAJA."
george.schmidt,"Oct 7, 2002",N/A,"SPIRITED AWAY (2002) **** (ANIMATED/JAPANESE  DUBBED) (Voices: Daveigh Chase, Suzanne Pleshette, Michael Chiklis, Lauren Holly, Susan Egan, Jason Marsden, John Ratzenberger, David Ogden Steirs.  Fantastic animated fantasy by acclaimed Japanese filmmaker Hayao Miyazaki constructs a unique story about a little girl who winds up in an amusement park for the spirit world and must save her parents' fate of being turned into swine all the while encountering odd characters, both benevolent and malevolent.  Awesome set pieces and colorful dreamscapes perpetuate the engrossingly entertaining storyline as it progresses with much humor, dread and sense of utter disbelief at just how magical animation can be.  One of the best of its genre."
yorbo,"May 12, 2002",10/10,"Beautiful, lovable, funny is how you could qualify ""Sen to Chihiro no kamikakushi"". It is the story of young Chihiro who gets caught in an abandoned theme park, with her parents transformed into pigs she has to find a way to get out of there and change her parents back. Yet another masterpiece by Miyazaki, can't wait for his next movie...."
Alli-Antar,"Mar 6, 2007",10/10,"This movie is one of the best animated films I've ever seen. I was impressed with not only the creativity it must have taken to make this film, but also the strength of the female protagonist. The little girl Chihiro is the hero of the story (a modern fairy tale), and she must rescue her parents, who have been magically transformed into pigs due to their gluttony. Interestingly, and in contrast to many traditional fairy tales, none of the ""evil"" characters is completely evil - each character has at least one redeemable quality (even Yubaba, the ""evil"" sorceress, is nurturing toward her baby), making the film seem more believable and natural. The overall themes of the movie appear to be ecological awareness, identity (remaining true to oneself), kindness, moderation (avoidance of excess consumption), nourishing one's spirit, and resilience (persistence in the face of adversity). I came away from this film feeling inspired and refreshed."
scgfckzb,"Apr 1, 2021",10/10,"Thank God for Studio Ghibli and for this beautiful animated film. I have shared it with my sister, and now my children. My absolute favorite movie of all times."
jacktojack69,"Sep 26, 2006",10/10,"It's a wonderful feeling when a film that you were expecting to be pretty good turns out to be absolutely fantastic. This feature was a surreal, magical journey for all ages (although the kids may be frightened in a few spots) that carries as many messages as you could care to search for. A nice touch is the amount of homages they have chosen to pay to other such fantasy films (Snow White, Alice in Wonderland, Wizard of Oz, Neverending Story). Overall, a thrilling ride for the senses and a fresh breeze for anyone who is a little tired of the run of the mill fantasy crap that is being churned out by major American studios today. Spirited Away gives them all a good run for their money. Brilliant!!!"
RandomPerson123,"Mar 1, 2007",10/10,"Out of all the Hayao Miyazaki films, this has to be the best one of all time. Sure, Nausicaa may be his masterpiece, but Spirited Away is much better. For starters, we have your spooled 10 year old girl moving to a new town and after her parents turn into pigs, she has to rescue them. Yeah sounds like a contrived plot, but its the way she goes about doing things, as well as splendid animation and music that make this worthwhile. She has to work for a living, and no kid will do that willingly, but she manages and makes friends who help her out along the way. The dub work by Pixar is excellent, it makes sense in Japanese or in English. There are no slow points: quiet scenes yes but nothing is boring, the screen demands your attrition with all the detail, hand drawn to boot. In fact, it might take 2-3 screening on DVD to see everything."
Creamator69,"Feb 26, 2024",7/10,"I want to be as objective as possible. Captivating I think is a great descriptor for this film. Incredibly artistic and someone that finds the deepest of value in a story, I find that this is far too random to have a story that is consistently applicable. After all, stories have values that are applicable and the deepest ones make the greatest stories. This one is so incredibly artistic but there is no greatness in the story. Visuals and experience is very neat, it elicits odd feelings and certainly makes you question. It's similar to some modern art you may see where someone may throw paint at something which is certainly interesting what becomes of it, but it gives no deeper value. Subjectively you can make up any thought for any experience, which then begs the question why do you need to throw the paint then if it's essentially just randomness. I don't think randomness is what humans find beautiful, in fact I know that humans enjoy order and are mesmerized by it, largely because it is predictable and safer. You can chart why that is meaningful evolutionarily speaking. I digress, I think this deserved such a critical evaluation because of the absolute extreme positive opinion, when there is no objective way possible this is better than numerous films even with 8s. What makes a animated film a 10 or exceptionally high film, is an incredible story and narrative along with visuals and a soundtrack that is perfect in tying it all together. This does not do that. This does one of those things very well which is the visuals. VERY limited narrative with almost an impossible deeper value to obtain from it. One can speculate at best but I believe the author writes like this purposely. An author that is very creative and artistic but not necessarily top tier story teller. They express themselves and people enjoy that. That doesn't make it Great. That makes it good. There will be a type of people that will go crazy for this, those types will tend to be rather naive and have limited analytical capability. Largely female, it doesn't need to make sense it just needs to be ""expressive"". It's not an 8.6 and certainly not a 10. It's probably realistically a 7.2-7.8 area."
gleitont,"Aug 5, 2019",10/10,"I'm in love with this movie, it touches me in a way. Even looking at poster art makes me emotional. Wonderful, unique."
markoradojevic69,"May 26, 2025",6/10,"I've watched Spirited Away a few times now, hoping that something in it would finally resonate with me. It's often praised and rightfully so for its imaginative world-building, detailed animation, and boundless creativity. From a purely technical and artistic standpoint, Hayao Miyazaki's work is ahead of its time. His attention to detail, the richness of the world he creates, and the freedom in its storytelling are nothing short of remarkable.That said, Spirited Away just doesn't click with me on an emotional level. As a big anime fan, I kept expecting to feel that deeper connection others describe, but for me, it's missing a certain emotional core. I respect Miyazaki's vision and the themes he explores, but the characters, especially Chihiro, never fully pulled me in. The pacing also feels uneven at times there's so much happening, but not all of it feels necessary or impactful.I'm not a personal fan of Miyazaki's storytelling style, though I absolutely respect what he's achieved. I recommend Studio Ghibli films to almost every anime beginner because of their accessibility and artistry. But if I'm being honest, this particular film isn't for me.So while I admire Spirited Away for its creativity and influence, I can't say it left a lasting impression on me emotionally. My personal rating is a 6 out of 10. It's worth watching, especially if you're exploring anime classics or love visually rich, fantastical stories. Just don't be surprised if, like me, it doesn't hit you in the heart the way it does for many others.Also, there are many Japanese legends and folklore references throughout the film that you probably won't catch unless you're familiar with that cultural background, which can create a feeling of detachment for some viewers.Still, it's a movie that deserves to be seen, if only to understand why so many people hold it in such high regard.My rating: 6.2/10."
Dark Raven,"Sep 21, 2003",2/10,"Why?  Why do so many people hold this very average film on such a high pedestal?  Being quite a big fan of Anime I'm not new to the genre.  This was a serious head f***.  I will say the production design, use of color and music score were amazing.  However, in terms of plot, story structure, catharsis, plant and pay off...it's all over the place.  I felt the world had no rules to it and therefore lacked any real tension.  I felt the story lacked any logic to it and therefore had no reason behind the motivation for characters.  Why did she do that? What is that supposed to be?  What was that all about? When will this end or start making sense?  With so many positive reviews and awards I'm confused.  Perhaps I just didn't get what others got from it...  All I have to back me up is the crowd of friends with whom I went to see the film with.  And I'm the one who had the most positive words to say about it."
frd_19,"Nov 1, 2003",N/A,"for me, this movie doesn't seem to be the best animated movie ever made.Yes i notice most of you consider this to be the best one ever, considering the position at #42 of 250 top movies of all time. But for me, all i can say is that the movie's scenes and background are the most outstanding scenes and background of all animated movies i've ever seen. The cinematographic scenes and background is so realistic that it doesn't seem to be just a still and 'Dead' animated movie. it's just brilliant that it's very very complicated to make, so real, the lighting and shadows.but that's all!! and what i dont like? i dont like the human characters, just say like chihiro and her parents. Chihiro is not cute at all to move me in the movie, and is not cute at all to make me really interested to the movie, or even not cute at all to say this is the best animated movie ever made. it's just so unperfect and old fashioned. and the story is so alice In Wonderland. maybe it's the japanese version of it, but it just seems to be not really creative. most of u say this is the best animated movie ever, but for me and most of my friends where i live at, this is not. so i wanna put it this way: if a movie had so much attention and compliments, it should have been most of the time, most of the place, and most people , right? I hope my comments are welcomed. ;)"
xcutepandax,"Feb 7, 2012",9/10,"After seeing the whole movie, i didn't have to think twice about going back and watching it again, it was an awesome experience. Some of the characters were beyond strange, but of everything i did absolutely adore the little things between Haku and Chihiro they were beyond cute.I do recommend this, to all ages, it gives you quite the perspective of adventure and a new sense in realizing the differences in everything.The movie was really thrilling it was a bridge from our world to another. it absolutely was, i want to get it on DVD.Anyone, anyone at all would love it, at times it seems like a little kiddie then other times it appears more mature and more advanced but its in the middle its really good for all ages. I guess you just need to understand it. Wonderful characters (well, some of them), effects were good, designs were something i haven't seen before, it was all pleasant.All i can really say to explain it is that its; A bridge from our world to another."
schanzaysohail,"Feb 12, 2021",10/10,"Loved this movie, the animation was absolutely beautiful and the plot was great. Was written so well and animated so nicely. It does not look like it was made back in 2001 its too good. Would recommend this to anyone! you can watch it with kids too..."
Reklamdariai,"May 10, 2024",9/10,"The best anime movie watched so far, for a not-a-fan of anime genre. The idea and philosophy behind the movie does perfectly showcase the problems of the society. I also enjoyed the beautifully pictured scenery and the main character, Chihiro Ogino. The girl represents a simple and joyful, sometimes naive and a very curious, brave and wise individual, who inspired me a lot. Although this character is a young aged girl, her wiseness and bravery surpasses the grown-ups, whos' values represent the weaknesses of majority of our society. This is definitely a must watch for everyone, even if you are not a fan of animated movies."
sikorskd,"Apr 11, 2002",10/10,"While Princess Mononoke introduced many of us to the genius of Miyazaki, Sen is his consecration as one of the best animator and storyteller of recent memory. Sen is the gorgeous, mystical,  ""Alice""-themed bildungsroman of a little girl from childhood to adulthood. Like in Mononoke, the imaginary world of Miyazaki of filled with enchanted creatures and gods, all of them extraordinarily original. However, Miyazaki now introduces humour to his film. He has apparently created this masterpiece as a gift to his ten-year old daughter. This is a beautiful gift that we should all benefit from."
markmarukka,"Apr 18, 2022",10/10,"The only other anime I ever got into, was dragonball z. So I was hesitant to watch this. But I'm so glad I did! If you need a movie to watch to get lost in and take your mind off things in the real world stresses; this is the perfect movie.The charecters and world and writing is just on a whole different level of creative, its absolutely amazing. Everything about it, is unique. It's sorta like an Alice in wonderland movie, but 100 times better."
Remi_Myrina,"Jun 11, 2019",10/10,"It is rare that you find a film that will stick with you for the rest of your life, especially one as far from reality as Miyazaki's 'Spirited Away'. A true example of cinematic genius, this film appeals to people of all ages, and viewers will walk away with their minds still stuck in the land of spirits. The awe-inspiring animation and beautiful scenery will take your breath away every time you watch it, and it presents a believable array of characters that you will grow close to over the course of the film. If there is one film you must see before you die, I would say this definitely in the running."
erikab-967-384492,"Nov 13, 2021",6/10,"This film has been on my watch list for so long! All of the amazing reviews increased my expectations too. I waited so that I would be free from distractions and devote 100% attention to the film.... I fell asleep with 30 minutes to go and had to finish it the next day.The story had so much potential but the film didn't have the usual depth of emotion and captivation you expect from anime films.I think for me there was too much focus on sub characters not enough development on the main characters relationship and it just felt like it wanted to achieve too much so ended up being a compendium of smaller themes pulled together to make a film. Either I have been spoilt by Howl's, Your Name etc and my expectations are now too high or I've missed something with with this film?"
iamanoob0,"Jun 20, 2021",1/10,"I still can't figure out if this movie is a troll on the internet and everyone is pretending to think it's the best animated movie ever or if I'm missing something big. Because I just wasted 2 hours of my life since I was baited into believing that a movie with an 8.6 on IMDB may actually be accurate. Coming from an anime fan, I really wanted to enjoy this movie, I practically forced my family to watch it with me saying that it is the highest rated animated movie of all time. My whole family wanted to quit halfway through but I told them that there had to be something at the end that carried this movie, but no, there was nothing. No emotion, no plot twist, just a ""and everyone lived happily ever after"". I can tell from the some hundred of thousands of reviews that hardly anyone will agree with me. The only points I can give this movie is that the animation is somewhat decent and that there were some funny parts, but that is it. I also get that this movie age range is mainly for kids, but even my 7 year old brother hated it. I just don't understand what people get from watching this movie, I just came out wanting to forget everything I just suffered through. I know my review was long but I just needed to get my thoughts out and hope that people see this and may decide to not watch this movie. You can like Spirited Away but I will forever remember this as the worst animated movie I have ever experienced."
wwe_crazy_till_whenever,"Dec 30, 2006",10/10,"I was amazed by this film. The stunning animation that Hayao Miyazaki put together, the characters made me smile, the storyline was well put together & the film has the right to all of the praise that it has got. Chihiro is my favourite character in the film, her attitude that progresses over the course of the film is great, from being scared & worried to a courageous & brave girl. The creatures freaked me out a little bit, but that's what you'd expect in a Miyazaki film. It's the best animated film ever made in the history of modern cinema, no animated film will beat it, if one ever does it will probably be made by Miyazaki himself. If you think this film is good, I advise watching Miyazaki's other work, his films combines fantasy with feelings, & easily sweeps Disney under the rug. Spirited Away is simply amazing, lovers of great animation. This is the perfect film for you."
ravenwolf64,"May 29, 2004",10/10,"The attention to detail in this animation surpass most animations. The fantastic artistry depicts the character's emotions perfectly. You are immediately 'drawn' into the story and remain there until the credits. The story, the voice acting, the animation, are all the best examples I have seen in animation. Anyone familiar with Hayao Miyazaki's work knows he is a genius story teller and I feel Spirited Away is his best to date. This show is extremely entertaining for folks of all ages. If you are new to Anime this is definitely a great introduction to Asian quality and style animation. This show is perfect on all levels, I could not recommend it more."
amitkowe-25983,"Jan 18, 2021",10/10,I watched ths movie after 20 years. I feel like this is today's release. I love the world of ths magical movie. Just watch it n you get why is ths so appreciated.
merisoch,"Jun 5, 2015",10/10,"The first thing I did after I first finished watching this movie was to go on the IMDb website to check if it was, in fact, 124 minutes long. I wanted to ensure that my DVD wasn't messed up, and that I had watched the entire movie, because I was afraid I'd missed a few of its scenes. That's how confusing it had been the first time. I had to watch the movie again before I could understand it and make sense of the events. It might be confusing, but it is a great watch for the entire family, for both parents and children alike. No matter how old you are, you'll be able to connect to this movie and you will love it. I've often heard that this anime film is best-known for it's animation, but to me, the story's execution was most fascinating. A MUST-WATCH (and I'd recommend using subtitles no matter what language you're watching it in)."
x_manicure_x,"Aug 14, 2021",7/10,"Above all Studio Ghibli films, ""Spirited Away"" is probably the most widely recognized across the world thanks to its exotic, hauntingly beautiful art direction. The Japanese tradition-infused world of spirits that he managed to create here has such a unique atmosphere and some of the most memorable creatures to ever appear in an animation film.Stunning visuals aside, the same issues that tend to affect most Studio Ghibli films are still there to some extent. Hayao Miyazaki is a master at creating worlds, populating them with captivating characters, and setting a magical atmosphere, but the storytelling always feels kind of lackluster and unfulfilling. ""Spirited Away"" actually begins on the right foot and holds pretty well until Chihiro leaves the bathhouse to return the seal to Zeniba. That's when things were supposed to get even more interesting, but basically nothing happens. The ending and final resolution also felt rushed and low-key. Overall it's still a good fairytale for both children and grownups, but I am not sure we are talking about the best animation film of all times as everyone keeps saying."
LaurieMann,"Nov 2, 2002",9/10,"Ya gotta wonder - Disney is the US distributor, Disney knows how to market animated features - why has this breathtaking animated feature not been promoted at all in this country?It's a great movie, but really not for small children and it really doesn't have the toy/gadget possibilities of Disney flicks as most of the characters are not at all cute (except for Chihiro, of course).  And, perhaps, since animated features are now eligible for an Oscar, perhaps Disney decided to dump this movie, keep it forgotten in America, so they can promote the amusing (but hardly great) Lilo and Stitch come Oscar time.This movie has some of the most breathtaking backgrounds and animation I've ever seen.  True, here and there it has the kind of stilted animation of '60s TV animation.  But once Chihiro starts her adventures in the bathhouse, the animation practically leaps off the screen.  The level of detail in the backgrounds, particularly in the ""witch's lair"" is unlike anything I've ever seen (even better than Beauty and the Beast, which set the bar pretty high for outstanding detail).I don't know much about Japanese myth/legend, and I suspect that the Japanese moviegoers got much more out of this movie than I did.   Still, it was great fun to watch.  Chihiro is a genuinely annoying kid early in the film, and showed more character development during the course of the movie than some live actors I could mention.  Early in the movie, her parents are enchanted by a witch, and the rest of the movie is about little Chihiro almost going through hell to bring them back.This is probably not a good movie for sensitive children, but most kids much above six or seven should have a ball with it."
Efram,"Mar 30, 2003",6/10,"I just saw this film and I have no idea what is so special about this film. Maybe I just don't get it, but Japanese animation never has impressed me. It looks shoddy, no better than a Transformers or Thundercats cartoon from the 80's. The main point for me is that the characters in these films just aren't believable in their actions. The story was ok, but nothing groundbreaking. I didn't feel a sense of adventure or a message that was any more special than the next Disney Summer flick. 6/10"
marijapetrovicfr,"Nov 4, 2020",3/10,"I heard about this animated film a long time ago, and the reviews persuaded me to watch it. God! It was as if someone threw up all over the screen. I could hardly wait for it to end. Extensive imagination and huge inspiration, excellent animation, I admit that, but it was also necessary to direct it in the right way. So many things thrown from all sides, a man can only get sick from this. Such a waste of immense tallent. I think that got me the most, actually. Sorry, below all my expectations."
