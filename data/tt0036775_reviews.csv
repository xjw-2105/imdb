ma-cortes,"Jun 30, 2015",8/10,"Vintage Noir Film with gritty interpretation , atmospheric settings , crackling dialogue throughout and powerhouse filmmaking . This Billy Wilder's first thriller is one of the finest Noir film ever made . A scheming wife (Barbara Stanwyck) lures an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray , though Alan Ladd, George Raft, Brian Donlevy, James Cagney, Spencer Tracy, Gregory Peck, and Fredric March were all up for the leading role) into helping murder her husband and then declare it an accident . Both of whom concoct a twisted scheme to collect the benefits of a insurance policy . As the hubby's policy contains a clause that states that if the husband's death caused by a moving train the policy pays double face value . The investigator's boss (Edward G. Robinson) , not knowing his colleague is involved in it , suspects murder and sets out to prove it .This first-rate and entertaining American classic Noir film draws its riveting tale and power from the interaction of finely drawn roles as well as drama , emotion and moody atmosphere . This classic mystery thriller follows James M Cain's book fairly closely otherwise . Twisted film Noir about murder , troubled relationships , treason , dark secrets , including an unforgettable dialog ; being based on the James M Cain's novel , which in turn was based on the true story of Ruth Snyder, the subject of a notorious 1920s murder trial , being screen-written by the prestigious Raymond Chandler and the same Billy Wilder . However , Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler did not get along well while writing this film's script, a process that was apparently filled with arguments . As Billy Wilder didn't really get on with the famous novelist whose constant drinking irritated the director . It packs a good realization , an original script , haunting atmosphere , intriguing events ; for that reason madness and murder prevail . Fred MacMurray is superb as insurance salesman coerced into murder plot and Barbara Stanwick as predatory and alluring Femme Fatale is magnificent . Here his colleague Edward G Robinson is extraordinary and as cool as ever ; he plays as the astute and stubborn investigator , his scenes with Fred MacMurray are awesome and at their best . But Edward G. Robinson's initial reluctance to sign on largely stemmed from the fact he wasn't keen on being demoted to third lead . Good support cast formed by notorious secondaries such as Porter Hall , Tom Powers , Jean Heather , Byron Barr and Fortunio Bonanova . And Raymond Chandler's cameo , this marks the only film appearance of screenwriter and novelist Raymond Chandler .Exciting as well as complex film , possessing a mysterious and fascinating blend of gripping thriller , serenity , baroque suspense in which especially stands out the portentous performances , evocative cinematography in black and white by John F. Seitz and thrilling musical score by the classic Miklos Rozsa . The motion picture was stunningly directed by the great Billy Wilder , as the American Film Institute ranked this as the #29 Greatest Movie of All Time . The film was nominated for 7 Academy Awards but lost out on the night to Going my way (1944) by Leo McCarey. It got a deep inspiration for other films , it is particularly obvious for ¨Body heat¨ by Lawrence Kasdan with William Hurt , Kathleen Turner and Richard Crenna . Remade for TV in 1954 by Buzz Kulik with Frank Lovejoy , Ray Collins and Laraine Day , and 1973 TV remake of the 1940s classic by Jack Smight with Richard Crenna , Samantha Eggar , and Robert Webber ."
gftbiloxi,"May 3, 2005",8/10,"Author James M. Cain virtually created a new genre with his extra-tough, sin-blackened, and sex-drenched novels--and they were so successful with the public that not even 1940s Hollywood could resist. The result was three of the most famous films of that decade: MILDRED PIERCE, THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE, and DOUBLE INDEMNITY. Although POSTMAN is probably the better film, INDEMNITY is the most famous--possibly due to the story's truly psychotic edge, which is given full life by Barbara Stanwyck in one of her most celebrated performances.Like POSTMAN, INDEMNITY offers the story of a married woman who plots with her lover to murder her husband. Given MacMurray's typically ""good guy"" image, I didn't expect to believe him in the role of Walter Neff in the role of skirt-hungry Walter Neff--but MacMurray's performance is exceptionally good here, and all the more effective because it so completely unexpected. But while MacMurray has most of the screen time, it is really Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson who dominate the film. Stanwyck is truly memorable here, and gives us a woman who seems at once sexed-up and completely frigid, at once completely natural and absolutely artificial. It is a remarkable and often disturbing effect. Robinson, who endured decades of type-casting, is equally good as the blustery, slightly comic, and absolutely honest insurance man whose job it is to ferret out suspicious claims; it is largely due to his performance, which gives the film a moral center, that we are able to buy into the otherwise off-beat performances that drive the action.This was one of director Billy Wilder's first major hits, and he deserves considerable credit for making the weird elements of the story work as a whole, keeping the film smartly paced, and heaping it up with atmosphere. So influential that its impact would be difficult to over-estimate, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a touchstone for the entire film noir genre. Recommended.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
Spondonman,"May 2, 2004",9/10,"I've now seen this movie 14 times in 25 years, at all times of the year, in all moods, sober or not etc - but always at night. I recorded my copy off TV in 1987 so I can only imagine what a remaster would do for it. With an atmosphere thick enough to cut with a knife it never fails to engross and enchant me, and although it's been dated for 40 years or more still seems relevant and watchable today. TV, answer phones, recordable CD/DVD, memory sticks and the internet have all come between us and yet I can still watch Fred MacMurray speaking into a Dictaphone without a qualm. Who wears a hat in California nowadays? Who buys beer whilst driving! Lift attendants have gone but I can still believe in Charlie working and laughing away in the garage past 11 at night.Woman and man agree to murder woman's husband but on the way to the cemetery they face grilling by insurance company. I think everything has been said before on the IMDb - by those who think it's one of the best films ever made! To those who simply think the main problem is that it's dated I wish you could see the TV commercials that dug into DI back in '87 - what a hoot - and compare. I've just noticed the print TCM UK is showing in 2005 is lip-synced out, very wobbly Rosza music track, fading and ageing fast - worse than my 1987 video tape (maybe logically). They're supposed to be encouraging people to enjoy the classics but they won't do that with such inferior screening copies. Dear TCM UK, this is an impressive iconic film - it deserves a billion dollar remaster authorised by the Library of Congress, not repeatedly trotting out unimpressive cheap worn dupes to fill those 2 hour slots.Everything about DI from the acting, production, direction, and music is superbly dignified and is as ""close to perfection"" as human beings are probably allowed to get with this form of Art - especially with the more limited technology at their disposal in '44. When most films from now are long forgotten and dated DI will still be getting re-runs on TV and art-house cinemas - God and remasters willing - that is the fact of it.Fortunia Bonanova certainly was fortunate to have appeared in bit parts in 2 of the best films ever made - Citizen Kane the other."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Nov 8, 2000",10/10,"This is one of the best films of all time, not necessarily because of its story but because of the acting, direction, cinematography, lighting, and just the way that the story itself was told. At the time the film was released, the idea of revealing who the killer was in the opening scene was virtually unheard of, but it ended up being very effective because it allowed the audience to concentrate more on other elements of the film, which was the goal of Billy Wilder, the director. Instead of trying to figure out who the perpetrator was, there is more emphasis on how the crime was pulled off, what mistakes were made during the murder, who betrayed who, how close Barton Keyes (the insurance investigator) was getting to solving the case, and, probably most importantly, what kind of person Walter Neff is and whether or not sympathy should be felt toward him.Barbara Stanwyck, in one of the most remembered performances of her extensive career, represents (with nearly flawless ease) the cold and ruthless manipulator who has no difficulty in ruining other people's lives in various ways (including death, if necessary) in order to get what she wants. Known in the film community as the `femme fatale,' this is someone who uses her sexual prowess, seductiveness, and emotional detachment to drag an unsuspecting person (generally an interested man) into a scheme from which she is expected to benefit heavily and he is most likely headed for destruction. In these types of films, the man often either finds his life in ruins or ends up dead, as is often (but not always) also the case with the fate of the femme fatale.Barbara Stanwyck (as Phyllis Dietrichson, the murderous femme fatale in Double Indemnity) and Fred MacMurray (as Walter Neff, her victim'), have amazing chemistry on screen. Their attraction is incredibly well portrayed, and the development of their relationship with each other is so convincing that what happens between them almost seems normal. Besides that, their mutually calculated interaction, although it seems at first like it has been rehearsed endlessly and ultimately brought unconvincingly to the screen, is exactly as it was meant to be, because it represents each character's intentions, even very subtly foreshadowing their future betrayals against each other. Phyllis has gone through every word she ever says to Walter in her head. She has practiced what she wants to say when she brings up the idea of life insurance to Walter in the beginning and she knows what she wants to say whenever they interact with each other because she has been planning for quite some time the prospect of murdering her husband in order to collect his fortune. Walter, conversely, methodically makes amorous advances as though this is something that he does regularly, and then ultimately he also plans out his conversations with Phyllis because he begins to suspect her and is sure to tell her only what he wants her to hear. This seemingly stiff dialogue brilliantly represents Phyllis and Walter's precise (and sinister) intentions, and it's quick pace creates a feeling of urgency and restlessness.Probably the most fascinating and entertaining actor in the film, Edward G. Robinson, plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and employer at the insurance company where he works. Keyes is a very suspicious man who closely investigates the insurance claims which come into the company, having a striking history of accurately isolating fraudulent claims and throwing them out. His handling of Phyllis's (and Walter's, technically) claim and the way that he gets closer and closer to the truth create a great atmosphere of tension and drama.Double Indemnity is nearly flawless. From the shocking and unexpected beginning to the already known but still surprising end, the audience is held rapt by the excellent performances, the brilliant and imaginative direction, and the flawlessly created atmosphere. This is excellent, excellent filmmaking, and is a classic film that should not be missed."
jmholmes-73727,"Feb 19, 2019",10/10,"Barbara Stanwyck changed the trajectory of her career with her ruthless, icy performance here. Fred MacMurray, however, would never again allow himself to duplicate anything similar to Walter Neff's troubled, doomed portrayal again on screen. Playing against their dark alliance, it is left to Edward G. Robinson to win the audience over as he struggles to shed light on the insurance fraud and murder.
This script should be studied by anyone who plans to write for TV or movies. Note the significant changes Wilder and Chandler made from James Cain's original novel - changes Cain admitted were improvements.
Especially worthy of mention is the level of artistry displayed in the final minutes when, after an hour and a half of of bitter nastiness, Wilder gives us just the smallest spoonful of sugar that wraps everything up perfectly. There's almost something criminal when evil is such a treat to watch."
purrlgurrl,"Oct 13, 2019",10/10,"The best film adaptation of a James M. Cain novel ever made (neither version of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" even comes close). The script, by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is flawless. Wilder's direction is masterful. The cast is phenomenal, with Fred McMurray as a smart-talking but naive chump, Edward G. Robinson as a shrewd and relentless insurance investigator, and Barbara Stanwyck (her very best performance ever, IMO) as a scheming wife who wants her inconvenient husband out of the way.The smartly-written dialogue still snaps and crackles and the suspense has lost none of its edge in the 70-plus years since the film was made. This is as fine a thriller as you'll ever see and a film that truly deserves being called a classic."
dougdoepke,"Apr 24, 2013",N/A,"No need to recap the plot or echo consensus points.From the minute he sees her slinking down the stairs in that spangled ankle bracelet, he's hooked. Walter Neff's already boarded that long, lonely trolley down the one-way track. Yes indeed, sultry Phyllis appears to be just the ticket he's been looking for. Great noir classic. All in all, Neff should have paid attention to that other member of the oddball triangle. Old man Keyes may be a born cynic, but despite himself, he's a father figure looking for a son to take his place, and warning Neff about the ""Margie's"" of the world. What he doesn't know is that this ""Margie"" definitely doesn't drink out of a bottle. What's more, Neff's already chosen to ride with the flashy crowd, get out of that dumpy apartment, and get into Phyllis's vicious little insurance swindle. As Keyes tellingly remarks, ""You're not smarter than the rest, Walter, just a little taller."" I like to think that Walter finally realizes his folly in that brilliant final scene, even if it is too late. Still, the film's cynical veneer is misleading. Because beneath all the deceits, betrayals, and ironies, lies a lighted match and one of the odder father-son relationships in Hollywood annals."
ccthemovieman-1,"Dec 23, 2005",10/10,"This is one of the best-liked classic films of all time and I am among that large group of fans as well.Few movies have ever had dialog this entertaining.....at least the conversations between Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray. I think it's a big appeal to this movie, except to younger folks who look at it as ""cheesy.""I read the book, Double Indemnity written by James Cain, and was surprised that the film's snappy dialog was not in it. This is one of the rare times when the movie was far better than the book. That's not a shock after you find out that literary giant Raymond Chandler and Hall Of Fame director Billy Wilder combined to write the screenplay,For a murder/suspense story, there is very little action, almost none, yet there are no boring lulls. The three main actors - Stanwyck, MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson, are what make this so good.MacMurray's narration is fun to hear as he tells the story in flashback, from the beginning by dictating into an old Dictaphone to his co-worker Robinson. The latter is almost mesmerizing in his performance, the way he delivers his lines. He can even make a speech about something as boring as insurance and still keep you riveted to the screen.Stanwyck was no sex symbol (at least to me) but she looked great here in the most seductive of 1940s clothing and, like Robinson, has a distinctive voice and accent that keeps your attention.This film was the inspiration for the 1980 movie, ""Body Heat,"" starring William Hurt and Kathleen Turner. That, too, was a very, very good movie....but not many films are in the class of this one."
jotix100,"Jul 17, 2005",10/10,"There are occasional times when all the elements come together to make a great film that will stand the passing of time. ""Double Indemnity"" seems to be an example of this phenomenon.First, there was a great novel by one of America's best mystery writers, James Cain, who created these characters that seem will live forever in our imagination. Then, the lucky break in getting the right man to direct it, Billy Wilder, a man who knew about how to make a classic out of the material that he adapted with great care and elegance with Raymond Chandler, a man who knew about the genre.""Double Indemnity"" works because it's a story we can relate to. There is a greedy woman trapped in a bad marriage, who sees the opportunity when she encounters an insurance agent who is instantly smitten with her and who has only sex in his mind. The manipulator, Phyllis Dietrichson, doesn't need much to see how Walter desires her. His idea of having her husband sign an insurance policy he knows nothing about, thinking he is doing something else, will prove a fatal flaw in judgment.Mr. Wilder achieves in this film what others try, with disastrous results. The director, who was working under the old Hays Code, shows so much sex in the film with fully clothed actors, yet one feels the heat exuding from the passion Walter Neff feels for Phyllis. He is a man that will throw everything away because he is blinded by the promise of what his life will be once the husband is out of the picture.In life, as well as in fiction, there are small and insignificant things that will derail the best laid plans. First, there i Jackson, the man who shouldn't have been smoking at the rear of the train, contemplating the passing landscape. Then, no one counts in the ability of Barton Keys, the man in the agency who has seen it all! Walter and Phyllis didn't take that into consideration and it will backfire on their plan.We try to make a point to take a look at ""Double Indemnity"" when it shows on cable from time to time. Barbara Stanwyck makes a magnificent Phyllis. There are no false movements in her performance. Phyllis gets under Walter's skin because she knows where her priorities lie and makes good use of them in order to render Walter helpless under her spell.Fred McMurray makes a perfect Walter. He is consumed by his passion and he will do anything because of what he perceives will be the reward for doing the crime. Walter Neff was perhaps Mr. McMurray's best creation. He is completely believable and vulnerable.Edgar G. Robinson, as Barton Keys, makes one of his best performances for the screen. Keys is a man that has seen all the schemes pass by his desk. He is, in a way, Walter's worst nightmare, because working next to Keys, he gets to know how wrong he was in the planning of the crime.The supporting cast is excellent. Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines, Fortunio Buonanova and John Philliber are perfect.The music score of Miklos Rosza gives the film a texture and a dimension that capitalizes on the action it intends to enhance. Also the music of Cesar Franck and Franz Schubert contribute to the atmosphere of the movie. The great cinematography of John Seitz, who will go on to direct films, is another asset in the movie. Edith Head's costumes are absolutely what a woman like Phyllis would wear right down to her ankle bracelet.This film shows a great man at his best: Billy Wilder!"
AlsExGal,"Jan 5, 2019",10/10,"... exactly because NOBODY is clean here! Nobody has really pure motives. Even the guy trying to solve what he thinks is a crime, Neff's boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson), looks at this as a puzzle to be solved, money to be saved for his insurance company, not a wrong to be righted. Sure, he does some verbal moralizing to Neff along the way, never guessing that he is talking to one of the perpetrators, but it is just a coincidence.The dialogue is as sharp as a knife, and MacMurray and Stanwyck, this unlikely pair of conspirators, are the absolute best at delivering dialogue with wicked incisiveness. The plot is very simple, but is so intense that it can never find the blanket of infinity which devours it. Neff (MacMurray) knows Dietrichson (Stanwyck) is up to no good and is a deviant of the highest degree. He dislikes her, certainly does not trust her, but he is entangled by her magnetism and potent sexuality. He is a fly caught in her web. He has much opportunity to escape from this nightmare, before the deed is done, but never does.Eddie Muller hosted this on Turner Classic Movies' Noir Alley the other night, and I thought he could not bring anything new to a film I've seen a hundred times, yet he did. He raises the question - Why DID Neff, when he believed he was dying, go back to the insurance office in the middle of the night and confess everything to Keyes via a dictaphone, when his destination was Mexico? Was it an act of contrition, as the production code might want us to believe, or was it an act of bravado, perhaps wanting his boss to know that he was the smarter egg after all, and not being sure he would live to tell it to him in person? You decide."
The_Experiment_In_Terror,"Dec 23, 2002",9/10,"If you are a noir fan then this film is an absolute must see. The screenplay itself is a work of art in its charater construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delievered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delievers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them. Billy Wilder should be proud of this work eventhough the Academy didn't see it fit to reward him for his efforts, however I personally think this film is an absolute winner."
strong-122-478885,"Oct 22, 2013",6/10,"*Possible Spoilers!*Released in 1944 - Double Indemnity's story of vicious betrayal may be somewhat flawed and inconsistent - And, its 3 principal actors may have been miscast (especially Barbara Stanwyck as the deceitfully wicked femme fatale in a really cheap-looking wig) - But, overall, it's quite easy to see why this vintage, Hollywood Crime/Drama is considered to be a true ""classic"" of 1940s Film Noir.Containing plenty of loaded dialog, shadowy settings and frequent flashes of well-timed tension, Double Indemnity's story of murder and deception comes together quite nicely like that of a master jigsaw puzzle where all of the scattered pieces of its plot-line eventually become one.Even though I view Double Indemnity as essentially a ""Chick Flick"", its story is told (chiefly in long flashbacks) by a man who was directly involved in this double-crossing crime-of-passion that went seriously haywire.Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an over-confident, yet naively gullible insurance salesman, who, thinking that he's got it all figured out, gets played for an all-time sucker when the seductive, well-to-do Mrs. Dietrichson snares him into a diabolical plot to kill her husband in order to collect $100,000 through the double indemnity clause in his life insurance policy.Needless to say, once Neff gets himself completely tangled up in a web of establishing alibis (while setting the wheels of the ""perfect"" crime into motion), things literally begin to come apart at the seams once he inadvertently learns about the treacherous activities (both past and present) of the calculating and conniving Mrs. Dietrichson.Filmed in glossy b&w, Double Indemnity's story was co-written by the famed crime-novelist, Raymond Chandler. It was directed by Billy Wilder, known for such other notable films as - Sunset Boulevard, Stalag 17, The Seven Year Itch, and Some Like It Hot."
StevenKeys,"Sep 6, 2021",4/10,"First in a series of sap noir, that tag inspired by Sam Spade who refused to ""play"" one (The Postman, Out of the Past, The Killers). Not so much dark as brown around the edges criminal melodrama, sap noir begins to drip when a male in lead (MacMurray) falls under the spell of a designing dame (Stanwyck) who hatches a scheme that's doomed from the get go, one the cluckhead just can't resist and then it's only a matter of time until the bloodhound in residence (Robinson) figures their game and the malefactors both end up eating a bullet or getting the electric chair. Seemingly normal men who work in a professional capacity do not throw it all over, i.e., commit pre-meditated murder, because of ""a little bit of money "" and an over-dressed dame with a dye-job, especially when he knows the designer might some day do the same thing to him. There must be a foundation, a basis for belief in eachother to invite serious risk taking (See; Bonnie & Clyde, Gun Crazy), something entirely lacking in D/I.The story is predictable, dialogue pulpy ('Hey, Baby!') and actors faces all as familiar as the Studio's moralizing message, 'Crime never pays!,' yet, with Wilder directing and Barbara in fatale, even as she looks more ridiculous than devious (Barnes), its cult status is strong. Billy mastered the dram com (Stalag Sunset Some), not so, serious drama, where his darkness devolves into depressing (Ace / Lost). Jean Peters or Beverly Michaels might've made this Cain work more credible for tawdry temptress just wasn't in Stany's wheelhouse, not dressed like that (Head). I'd not give it the time, but if you like classic celebrity and following trends, this might be the parade you're looking for (2/4)."
jet1415,"Dec 2, 2001",N/A,"Double Indemnity begins with a car speeding on a dark, rainy night.  This begins the classic film noir plot.  Billy Wilder directs a steamy and grabbing film.  Billy Wilder pulls this film together with an awesome cast, perfect lighting and an amusing script.  Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an unsuspecting insurance salesman.  He is unsuspecting in the sense that he is unaware of what the femme fatale' is going to put him up to.  Barbara Stanwyck plays the femme fatale', Phyllis Dietrichson, a manipulative housewife who will stop at nothing to get what she wants.The film begins in present day giving insight into Walter's current plight. Walter Neff gives the voice over as the plot unfolds.  It starts in the present time allowing the audience to know what crime has happened without the interesting details to support it.  This is an interesting twist to the common film noir plot.  Knowing the crime at hand keeps the audience hungry for those details.  Walter is the victim of the beautiful woman who manipulates him into pulling off a murderous insurance fraud scam.  Walter is an impeccable insurance salesman and Phyllis, in some ways, forces him into providing her with what she needs.  Phyllis is the typical femme fatale' who has no problem in using others to get what she wants.Throughout the film Walter is completely enamored by Phyllis.  Walter could have coined the pet name baby' with his fondness towards Phyllis by calling her that throughout the film.  He is easily distracted by her beauty and evil charm.   He seems to be entranced by Phyllis's ankle bracelet, so much that he mentions it numerous times.  This allows the audience to feel the sexual tension between the two.  Phyllis, on the other hand, shows the audience that she can use and abuse anyone who gets in her way.  While believably attracted to Walter, Phyllis keeps him hopping to fulfill her needs.  She pulls him in and handles him like a puppet.  She is the epitome of the film noir genre's femme fatale'.Barton Keyes, played by Edward G. Robinson, is Walter's co-worker and friend at the insurance company where he works.  Barton closely investigates all insurance claims that come across his desk.  While at one time Walter assuredly agreed with this practice, once Barton starts to unravel the mystery behind Mrs. Dietrichson's insurance claim, we begin to see just how nervous and paranoid Walter is.  Walter then begins to see Phyllis in a whole new light.  Barton plays the integral part by piecing together details that are thrown around throughout the film.  This keeps the tension high for the filmgoer.  These details are pieced together perfectly through to the end.Double Indemnity has the perfect plot with the perfect cast.  Walter and Phyllis' attraction are tasty and the crime is wonderfully puzzling. Double Indemnity is the true film noir giant."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 1, 2011",10/10,"Billy Wilder had directed some wonderful movies, Some Like it Hot, Sunset Boulevard, Sabrina, The Apartment and Witness for the Prosecution are all fantastic. Double Indemnity is up there with his very best. Wilder directs impeccably, but his direction is not the only great thing about Double Indemnity. Everything is great about it, it is a timeless classic and defines the term quintessential film noir.The cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments, instead it is all fluid and beautiful, and the costumes, sets and scenery also help. Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay.The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well. Barbara Stanwyck I think is sexy, her character appeals and her dialogue is so good as is her delivery of it, while Edward G.Robinson gives a superb supporting performance.All in all, a stunning film and one of the very best of the genre. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Xstal,"Feb 12, 2023",9/10,"Walter Neff wants to sell you insurance, in an uncertain world, he wants to give you assurance, if a loved one is lost, for a minimal cost, he can recompense with a small finance. Phyllis Dietrichson likes the idea, of insuring her husband so dear, doesn't want him to know, about all of the dough, she'll receive if his luck disappears. Barton Keyes is a claimant inspector, a shrewd and discerning detector, of fraud and deceit, he'll find out if you cheat, has the stats to deduce the risk factor.Three outstanding performances in a great piece of filmmaking that perpetually rewards on subsequent visits."
imauter,"Jun 12, 2003",10/10,"Double Indemnity is based on a novel by James Cain adapted to the screen by great novelist Raymond Chandler, who made here his most important contribution to the cinema history in his career, though somehow matched by following screenwriting work for 1946 Howard Hawks' classic The Big Sleep, and Billy Wilder, who previously worked as a screen writer for Ernest Lubitsch and had been already nominated three times for Academy Awards in the process before making Double Indemnity, which nevertheless played the key role in establishing him as one of the best writer-directors in Hollywood, and giving him his fourth Oscar nomination as a writer and his first one as a director.Double Indemnity was the third feature Wilder directed after 1942 The Major and the Minor and 1943 Five Graves to Cairo, but it was definitely the first film, his primary American tragedy where the author for the first time revealed his black and somehow hopelessly pessimistic view of the American society and of the human society in general, blackishly desecrated in the film simply by populating it with exceptionally sordid characters, who independently of being a victim or victimized, of being the protagonists or just simple supporters are never really able to transcend the utterly low and devilish motivations in theirs as a consequence sordidly painful lives and reach such a state where the viewer might get relieved by considering one of them as a positive element. Instead the characters' lives shown in a continuous noir flashback of Fred MacMurray's not-a-confession are driven from the start to the very end by an utter greed in a form of double and not only indemnities with consequential and inherent to it risks and fears in a rather unsure world of insurance.An insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), a man with `no visible scars', starts to lose his already shaky dominance over his mind's yearnings when glimpses on a horizon a possibility of becoming a recipient of a monetary fortune along with no less seductive desire from a part of unhappily married and as devilishly beautiful as resourceful in pursuing her zany in its deadliness schemes, an ultimate femme fatale blond Phyllis (marvellously portrayed by Barbara Stanwyck).Initially apparent as a romantic, the relationship gradually mutates into double confrontation of the two fears of the two characters in their greedy and ambitious pursuits, a conflict which at one point apparently results in a sort of humanization of Phyllis' character, appearing hiding the eyes of her soul behind the sun glasses, a humanization which is let to happen by her only to accentuate later her unchangeably fatal nature.The double confrontation gradually evolves into a triple one when the threatening presence on the scene of no less and probably more resourceful character of Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes more and more evident, as a result of his continuous and obsessive investigation conducted with different but nor less ambitious motives. A motives which find its ultimate revelation in a most touching, but finally most hypocritical scene of declaration of love (I love you - I love you too) between Walter Neff and Barton Keyes in the end, exactly reflecting the same nature of previous interactions between Walter and Phyllis, where such moments with the very words used, such as the supreme word of loving affection - Baby lowered to an unthinkable extent, only were a mere preparation to struck another blow in yet another outburst of hate caused by a new misfortunate complication in carrying out so well devised and apparently perfect plan.Permeated right from the start to the very end with the flavour of unstoppable fatality in an extent that a few other film-noirs achieved, accentuated by the wonderful music score by Miklos Rozsa, Double Indemnity's story is motored by the money like in nearly all of Billy Wilder films. But in this case all the misery produced by it as evident as never before resulting in utter corruption of already corrupted characters and their descent into a such a deep abyss of human misery as probably never before or after in a Hollywood film history, an abyss with no exit, with omnipresent hypocrisy, with no place for sincere human feelings of love, friendship or affection, an abyss to where the characters descent under the monotonous tune of Miklos Rozsa's score, which serves as a reflection of their monotonously hypocrite and ultimately doubly doomed lives. 10/10"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 31, 2017",10/10,"Walter Neff arrives at the home of The Dietrichson family, to sell insurance, with the husband absent he gets acquainted with the wife, Phyllis, the pair converse, and hatch a plan.I love the film noir genre, there were some superb offerings, there's a strong case for naming Double Indemnity as the best of the lot. Firstly the story itself, so wonderfully complex, loaded with twists and turns. Secondly the acting, so strong, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are superb as the film's leads. I particularly love the way that Walter narrates the story, an original format, getting it from his point of view.First time viewers are in for a treat, and will have zero idea of what the conclusion will be. Even now it looks so slick, excellent production values throughout, quite simply this film is exceptional. 10/10."
craigaconnelly1,"Oct 2, 2023",7/10,"As is often the case, the reputation of something can be so great, that it becomes difficult in reality to meet the expectations such regard can create. Perhaps this was a factor that shaped my opinion about 'Double Indemnity', and I therefore should be mindful of that when judging this movie. I liked and enjoyed it, which my rating intends to convey. But there were a couple of aspects that slightly disappointed me as well.Modern viewers probably need to recognise and keep in mind, a couple of important contextual points regarding this movie. Firstly, its subject material, plot and characters - particularly the portrayal of a woman of questionable virtue - had become rare for an A-level feature film in the United States, after the enforcement of the Production Code in 1934. Secondly, its commercial success proved that the movie-going public had an appetite for the genre, encouraging the industry to create the numerous imitators which soon followed.One could draw a parallel that this movie did in 1944, whatPulp Fiction (1994)did fifty years later. They both pushed the boundaries of what was palatable subject material, introducing new edgy dialogue and interactions between the characters, creating a new kind of ""Cool"" for their respective eras.I was disappointed with Fred MacMurray's lead performance, but it should be noted that my opinion here is definitely in the minority. I felt his efforts weren't very natural, especially in his scenes with Barbara Stanwyck, who came across as more comfortable in her role. Edward G. Robinson was unsurprisingly brilliant, and of these three mentioned stood out the most.Most people will enjoy this movie, and plenty will go much further with their praise. I personally rate it a fair way short of the greatest films noir, but of course, that is a very high bar indeed."
filmalamosa,"Jan 16, 2013",7/10,Everyone knows this film and everyone loves it.I tried to observe some flaws if there are any in it. The actress playing the daughter looked too old for the role. Stanwyck was 37 when this was made and Mc Murray was 36.I agree with the reviewer who stated Mc Murray's later roles in TV sit coms and so forth tainted his image. It's true it was hard to take him seriously.A new Cadillac driving around the rail road tracks might attract some notice especially in 1939 (the year this is supposed to take place).Also you have to suspend disbelief that Mc Murray would be so smitten by Stanwyck he would attempt anything like this. She is not especially at 37 (or any age!) the most attractive woman in the world. The blond wig? I guess was supposed to make her look ?? maybe cheap or tainted. She can carry any role though plouging through it like a bulldozer.But these are so minor. I loved the movie watch it and read the other reviews.RECOMMEND HIGHLY
a_baron,"Nov 2, 2020",5/10,"As film noir goes, ""Double Indemnity"" has little to offer; there are no gangsters, instead there is a highly improbable plot in which an insurance salesman falls over heals for the wife of one of his clients and almost immediately agrees to murder him. Actually, it isn't that improbable when one considers how some real life murder conspiracies begin and play out.
Barbara Stanwyck is the femme fatale, an intoxicating blonde married to a much older man.
There is a saying that when a woman badmouths her ex, remember that six months from now she may be badmouthing you. Now extrapolate this to if she murders the man in her life.
There is another saying: ""The best laid plans of mice and men...""
Having committed the near perfect murder, all they have to do is sit back and wait for the insurance money, but things don't go quite according to plan, and as the story starts near the end being related throughout in the first person singular, it doesn't take much nous for the viewer to foresee the inevitable outcome."
Mmmavis,"Mar 16, 2004",N/A,"""I liked the way that anklet bit into her leg. I wanted to see her again, up close, without that silly staircase between us.""--Walter Neff, after meeting Phyllis Dietrichson This is Fred MacMurray like you've never seen him before. He's edgy and sharp, and amoral, although he hides it well from his boss. Barbara Stanwyck's astounding performance set the standard for bad girls in Film Noir for years to come. I love this film because it is a perfect example of how the censorship of the time made it so that filmmakers had to get the sexiness across in a subtle way. This movie is undeniably sexy, and there's not a single 'love scene' in it!"
NewEnglandPat,"Aug 11, 2003",8/10,"This film noir classic may be the best murder mystery of all time in this storied Hollywood genre. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are excellent but it is Barbara Stanwyck who really makes the picture come together as a woman without a moral compass. Stanwyck set the standard for tough, calculating, shady women who exploit men without shame or remorse and her masterful manipulation of MacMurray is the movie's central theme. The film's imagery is filled with shadows and low lighting, accompanied by a tense, brooding music score. Stanwyck spins her web of ensnarement like a black widow with her victim seemingly unaware of the danger that enfolds him. MacMurray provides the narrative of the film which is told in flashback and delivers a cryptic account of the events in a confession to a boss who trusted him completely. Robinson is on target as the skeptical and suspicious boss who has a sixth sense about phony insurance claims. A nice supporting cast contributes to this thriller, namely Richard Gaines and Porter Hall."
Nazi_Fighter_David,"Jan 16, 2009",8/10,"There were some superb thrillers coming out of Hollywood in the forties which did not rely on the private eye conventions  but somehow the best of them were spread throughout by the same cynicism, the same realism, the same ruthless suspenseBest of all was Wilder's ""Double Identity."" It was based on a real-life assassination in New York in 1927, when a wife and her lover killed the husband for his insurance moneyIn the film, a near-breaking-point tension was reached and sustained in the passion of an insurance salesman and a passionately sensual femme fatale  an intense desire for each other and for money; in the murder of the poor husband; and in their useless attempts to escape the ability of a fast-talking investigator"
ferguson-6,"Jan 5, 2012",10/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. ""I wonder if you wonder."" Every time I hear Walter Neff say those words to Phyllis Dietrichson as their initial encounter concludes, I smile and settle in for another round of Double Indemnity (1944) ... one of my all-time favorites. Though I have seen it many times over the years, I recently saw it for the first time on the big screen ... and from a 35mm print! So much of the subtle filmmaking becomes apparent - the variance of lighting, the intensity of shadows, and the vividness of close-ups. This reinforces my belief that we should never miss an opportunity to view good films in a theatre setting ... just as the director intended.Since this film was released 67 years ago, it's difficult to discuss without noting a key plot point or character reaction. If you haven't seen it and plan to, you might stop reading here. If you would like a little insight, then let's keep going. Billy Wilder (left) directed the film and his place as a Hollywood legend is quite secure. He was nominated for 21 Oscars (Director, Writer, Producer) and had 3 wins. Some of his classics are: The Lost Weekend, Sunset Blvd, Witness for the Prosecution, Some Like it Hot, The Apartment, The Front Page. Many think of Wilder as a comedic filmmaker and he certainly had success in that genre, but if you watch closely, even his comedies have a dark element to them.Double Indemnity is based on the novella by James M Cain, who also wrote Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice. Wilder was a fan of Cain's book, but knew the dialogue wouldn't work well on screen. So together with Raymond Chandler they wrote a screenplay filled with crackling lines and a constant feeling of dread and pending doom. As great as the script is, it is heightened by a wonderful cast that includes Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, Edward G Robinson, Porter Hall, Jean Heather, Tom Powers, Richard Gaines and Byron Barr.For me, MacMurray's performance is what brings the words to life and jumps the film to the ""must see"" category. He is playing against two Hollywood heavyweights in Stanwyck and Robinson, but we are somehow sympathetic to this not-so-bright guy who gets played like a fiddle by the villainous, wily woman he lusts after. Even as he is recording his confession, a part of us understands how he got drawn into MURDER! Not just any murder, but one for money and love ... only there is no money, and there is no love.Ms. Stanwyck is perfectly cast as the femme fatale who weaves her web of deceit and destruction. She quickly spots the vulnerability of MacMurray's character and uses her assets just enough to hold the leash tight. It is a testament to her screen presence that she can pull off the sultry siren while sporting a less-than-desirable blonde wig. At the time, the wig was so controversial that the producers compared it to George Washington and wanted it trashed. However, filming was too far along and now it's impossible to imagine her looking any other way. Besides, MacMurray only seems to notice her anklet!Edward G Robinson made a name for himself as a tough-guy actor ... cop and mobster all rolled into one. Here he plays the insurance investigator with a sixth-sense for fraudulent claims. He is a hard-nosed, dedicated employee who takes his responsibility very seriously and has no sympathy for those who cheat his cherished system. He has a soft spot for co-worker MacMurray, even though he is one of the back-slapping salesmen he so loathes. Their relationship in the film is one of respect and about as close as two professional men could be, given the era. When Robinson goes off on his rant about suicide research, he is a joy to behold. This guy could flat chew scenery.In addition to the infamous wig, you might also notice that MacMurray is wearing a wedding band throughout the film, even though his character is clearly a single man. Wilder and MacMurray stated many times over the years that was simply a mistake and not ""caught"" until post-production. Expect a chuckle when MacMurray, as the narrator, enviously describes a Spanish style Los Angeles home as costing $30,000 ... probably less than the property taxes would be on that house today. The film originally was to end with MacMurray in the Gas Chamber and Robinson looking on (inset), but this was deemed inappropriate. One last little nugget: early in the film, MacMurray walks out of Robinson's office and past a man sitting on a hallway chair reading a paperback book. That man? Raymond Chandler, in his only on screen appearance.The film is often described as quintessential Film Noir. Another prime example of Film Noir would be The Big Sleep (1946), based on a Raymond Chandler novel, directed by Howard Hawks, and starring Humphrey Bogart and Lauren Bacall. While Film Noir might not be an easily definable term, there are certain elements that must be present. Lighting is key. Shadows must be prevalent. Some type of detective story is usually at the center, and we typically get some poor schlub of a guy being yanked around by the femme fatale. The right ""mood"" is essential ... as a viewer we know things are headed down the wrong path, but we just can't save the characters from their own poor choices. But neither can we look away. That helpless feeling is a strong indicator that you just watched a terrific Film Noir."
bkoganbing,"Dec 16, 2006",10/10,"Billy Wilder's cynical self came to public attention in this classic noir film about a luckless insurance salesman and one coldhearted dame. Double Indemnity skirted the very edges of Code morality and it took years before someone brought James M. Cain's novel to the screen.According to a book on Billy Wilder the casting of Barbara Stanwyck was a must for Phyllis Dietrichson, otherwise the film might never have been made. Barbara Stanwyck was that rarest of players, one who could be good and convincing in all kinds of parts. Look at the films she got her four Oscar nominations besides Double Indemnity, Stella Dallas, Ball of Fire, and Sorry Wrong Number. Not one of those is similar to any one of the others and Stanwyck was acclaimed in all of them.Fortunately for Wilder and for Paramount's budget, their leading man was right on the lot. Fred MacMurray who has been playing comedic foils for folks like Carole Lombard, Claudette Colbert, etc. up to that time, made the most of playing the feckless Walter Neff who gets sucked into a homicidal scheme through passion.Double Indemnity is a landmark film in that it's two leads are really rotten people. Barbara Stanwyck has a husband in Tom Powers she can't stand and would like to bump him off for an insurance settlement and MacMurray's the insurance salesman she beguiles into her plot. Funny thing is that when the mechanics of the murder plot are discussed and formulated, the ideas are all MacMurray's.Billy Wilder made two other films similar to Double Indemnity where a weak protagonist gets caught up in a filthy scheme. In Sunset Boulevard William Holden plays the gigolo way to well and can't break from unto pain of death. And Kirk Douglas's scheme about exploiting the tragedy of a man trapped in a cave brings him down all the way in Ace in the Hole. I'd be hard pressed to say which of the three men was worse.The man who brings them down is Edward G. Robinson, the claims investigator in the insurance office where MacMurray works. Robinson is gradually putting the whole thing together and Wilder is at his best with the scenes of Robinson explaining the progress of his investigation to MacMurray with Fred trying to stay one step ahead.Robinson doesn't usually get enough praise for Double Indemnity. He's got a little man, Hercule Poirot has those little grey cells. Either way both are up to the challenge of solving what looks like a perfect crime. Lot's of Agatha Christie's Belgian sleuth in James M. Cain's Barton Keyes.Wilder for the one and only time in his career worked with another great mystery writer in Raymond Chandler on the script. It was not a pleasant experience for either. Chandler complained about the working conditions of Hollywood and Wilder complained about Chandler's dissipation. Both were probably right.Among the supporting cast look for a nice performance by Porter Hall who turns out not to be as valuable witness as Robinson originally thought. The man from Medford may not lie, but he's not above a little chiseling.Double Indemnity is one eternal classic it will be studied and dissected by film students for centuries."
l-seidel,"Apr 21, 2014",7/10,"It was interesting watching this movie having already seen so many movies that clearly used this as source material. The fast talking, witty dialogue, woman with a money making scheme, and the use of romance/feminine wiles to achieve those means are all things that became the cornerstone of film noir. It's easy to see why this movie had such an impact given how perfectly each was executed. It was interesting to watch their so called perfect scheme unfurl bit by bit, especially in regards to how the characters reacted to this.The only thing that I wish is that I had gotten a little more invested in the romance and the characters themselves. Some later film noir films really nailed making me care about the plot through the eyes of the characters, which is my favorite approach to film. That is just my personal preferences though, and setting that aside, this was an incredibly well constructed film."
jaredmobarak,"Sep 30, 2008",8/10,"What many call the ultimate film noir, the murder mystery that is spoiled at the start, setting the stage for a retelling by our protagonist of the perfect crime, is unraveled before our eyes. Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity revolves around an insurance fraud murder that appears foolproof until the seams start to tear. Walter Neff, the top salesman two months in a row, falls in love with the young wife of an oilman, a woman looking for a way to leave her troubled marriage. Who better to get away with the perfect crime then a man that sees false claims avenged everyday? Their tracks must be covered and their guilt assuaged. However, being as our first scene shows Walter confessing to everything, we know the well-laid plans were unsuccessful. The trick to the film becomes how it all went down, how the puzzle pieces fell into place, and the power of a conscience, eating away at you until you can't stand the pressure any longer.It is not giving away anything to say that the two complete the task of killing Mr. Dietrichson, a businessman with a temper. The deed is orchestrated to look like he fell off a train, a venue for accidental death that comes with a special double indemnity clause, one that pays twice the cost of his recently purchased insurance of $50,000. That money is the impetus that pushes Neff over the top to help his new mistress. Phyllis Dietrichson is the damsel in distress, the nurse of her husband's first wife that was naïve and heartbroken for her boss after his loss. She says it compelled her to stay with him in a union that never held any love. The chance arrival of Neff not only opens her eyes to the possibility of a clean break without any strings and actually some cash to boot, but also to a man she can spend time and possibly settle down with. It is a strange coincidence that the Dietrichson's auto insurance was allowed to lapse, creating a house call, and a happy accident that the man called to visit was one as immoral as Walter. Right from the start he flirts and makes advances towards the woman he knows is married to his client. It's not until the end that you start to consider whether none of it was by chance at all, but instead carefully planned out and manipulated from the first second.Neff is played by Fred MacMurraya perfect fit for the role of a shady salesman, unafraid to get his hands dirty. The confidence and swagger allow us to believe he can win over the girl as easily as he does. He is the kind of guy that can fool the world into thinking he is on the level, a man of intelligence and pride. His boss, Barton Keyes and he have a very close relationship, one based on mutual respect and admiration. Neff has them all fooled into believing he is a man of character, one Keyes would personally vouch for, and his initial balk at the offer to help kill Dietrichson shows that maybe he is. Maybe there is some semblance of humanity behind the quick-witted banter and devious smile, a moral compass that won't allow him to cross the line. But greed and lust can tempt even a saint, let alone a guy like Neff, and it doesn't take long for him to begin the blueprints for what will be the perfect crime; one that not even Keyes and his keen lie detector can spot. It is that question of virtue that will ultimately undo him, though, as the strong stomach he thought he had might not be indestructible.The story revolves around MacMurray and as a result he is on screen almost the entire time. He is our narrator and our entrance point into the proceedings. However, it is not a role that we necessarily relate to, nor even begin to feel sorry for to hope he gets away with the crime. Instead, knowing about his confession from the beginning, we sit down to watch his hubris shred his world to pieces. Each person is a cog to the tale at hand; it is the plotting of the film that takes center stage and top billing. The pieces are moved and we follow them through the twists and turns and revelations that change our preconceptions of each. No one is truly as they seem and they all have an ulterior motive just below the surface, propelling their actions and attempts for survival whether the other does or not. Our two criminals are selfish at heart, but until you watch the entire journey, you won't know just how much.While the acting is definitely dated and a product of its time, it doesn't mean that it's not good. Barbara Stanwyck plays MacMurray's partner-in-crime Phyllis with equal panache. She holds her own in every situation, whether with her sharp tongue in some very funny back and forths or in her steely disposition when things get rough, it's a part that needs to be strong and is. Barton Keyes is the role that sticks with you, though. Edward G. Robinson is fantastic as the cocky claims agent, self-proclaimed as never being wrong when his gut says something isn't right. He delivers some of the best lines with such deadpan seriousness that you laugh even harder. The ego, cynicism, and attitude all add up to a man you have to respect, because under the tough exterior lies a man with heart. His dynamic with MacMurray is an interesting one, especially when seen through to the end. While they aren't completely fleshed out, each character is a detailed piece to the intricate web of deceit on display. Surrogates for the story to be shown to the audience, we watch them not for who they are, but for what they will do."
greggman,"Jul 31, 2020",6/10,I don't get the high reviews.Two random people meet and casually decide to murder someone. WHAT!? In what world does this happen?It might have been more interesting if it wasn't based on such a bologna premise. I watched this because I recently watched The Lady Eve which I loved so I went and looked for more Barbara Stanwyck movies. Unfortunately this one wasn't it.Not a spoiler but the ending doesn't match up with the beginning. The movie wants me to buy into people casually and easily ready to murder someone and thinking about it no more seriously than deciding to take a vacation. It then expects me to believe those same people have a conscience.Nope
dkar3,"May 21, 2016",4/10,"Oh my God! What laughable writing and dialog!! Its like of a spoof of itself. The story is OK, but is totally ruined by the writing and over-the-top acting. From start to end, its nothing but silly, catchy phrases you'd expect in a spoof on 40's detective movies. The required IQ for understanding the dialog is 40 or more, so do not be worried about following things.I was also unimpressed with the lighting. Simply filing a scene in insufficient lighting does not truly add drama and interest. Overall, this film is very unbelievable, laughable, and inane. Thankfully, MacMurray's career wasn't ruined by this horribly stupid film."
Jackmaster,"May 13, 1999",10/10,"This has got to be the coolest crime movie I've ever seen. What great dialogue! This is the penultimate film noir, but with Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler collaborating on the script I would expect nothing less. Barbara Stanwyck is perfect; you can just see her calculating and planning in those first few meetings with MacMurray, who is no slouch himself. I don't think he ever calls her by her first name, constantly calling her ""baby,"" while giving a great example of a man bored with his career and excited by a challenge and a hot dame. Edward G. Robinson is fabulous too. I was amazed by that suicide statistics speech! I don't think Miklos Rozsa's perfect score gets enough credit for creating the mood of this picture. It's so wonderfully foreboding, getting us ready for the cool, hardened crime drama that those first few notes and shots promise us. Absolutely perfect; if you catch it on TV or you're at the video store without a clue of what to get, check this one out. You won't be disappointed."
dataconflossmoor,"May 9, 2011",10/10,"In 1943, director of the film, ""Double Indemnity"", Billy Wilder, was painstakingly determined to complete a motion picture about this compelling novel written by James M. Cain. Cain is known for other great novels such as ""Mildred Pierce"" and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"". In the process of creating this major motion picture, several actors, including George Raft and Alan Ladd, turned down the job as the sinister leading male role in this movie. Finally, the part was offered to squeaky clean, Fred MacMurray, this appointment is literally, out of character for MacMurray! Barbara Stanwyck received the honor for the lead female role in ""Double Indemnity"", and Edward G Robinson was given the third billing as a star in this picture. This post of third billing was something that had not happened to Edward G Robinson since his prior acting days before ""Little Caeser"", which was made in 1931. Robinson capitulated to a third billing spot because he had a great admiration for the concept that the film ""Double Indemnity"" so intricately purported! The whole genre to ""Double Indemnity"" was set up flawlessly, as it orchestrated a deliberately contradictory dynamic. Behind the sunny pleasantry of Los Angeles, there lurked a deep rooted and conniving chicanery amidst a couple of masterminds who began implementing a horribly dark aspect of human behavior. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" manifested the rough exterior that the United Staes was besieged with because of their involvement in World War II. The American movie goer had become a little less naive since the advent of WWII, and, this reflected itself accordingly with regards to the type of movie they wanted to see. The film noir captivated the American public, and, now, the movie industry encompassed a myriad of wry depictions that were germane to the pejorative side of an individual. This dubiously sensationalistic technique by the motion picture industry was perceived as intriguing by the newly enlightened movie audience of the early 1940's!! The film ""Double Indemnity"" epitomizes the entire film noir pique, right alongside with the uncanny masterpiece ""Maltese Falcon"". ""Double Indemnity"" did not win for best picture in 1944, that year, the Academy Award was given to ""Going My Way"". As we all know, there are times when life simply does not make any sense, especially since a prominent Philadelphia critic rated ""Going My Way"" the worst Academy Award winning film in the whole history of the American cinema! ""Double Indemnity"" is considered to be Billy Wilder's best directing effort! The next year, Billy Wilder's directorial ability was totally vindicated, as he received his rightfully deserved acclaim with the film, ""The Lost Weekend"", which won for best picture in 1945. Billy Wilder received the Academy Award for best director that year as well. The film, ""Double Indemnity"" is truly remarkable!! The itemized and avaricious intensity to this movie was something that had not been depicted in films before the movie ""Double Indemnity"" was made. This film's wiles of malice and deceit were not expedited with a derivative and visceral disposition, rather, these antics were carried off with a dedicated fervor and paramount gratification. Fred MacMurray's character was perpetually afflicted with a relentless angst that infiltrated an acrimonious reveille to him about the primary repercussions of personal greed! His character, Walter Neff, endured a narrative agony which perpetuated a compulsive pontification about how people really are, as opposed to the way they are suppose to be! Barbara Stanwyck established her formidable status as a revolutionary femme-fatal in the Hollywood world of movies, with her performance in ""Double Indemnity"". Charismatically charming while wearing her diverse onslaught of angora sweaters, her beauty and allure became a necessary ingredient to the making of this film! The wig that Barbara Stanwyck wore for this movie, signified the overall mendacity to her heinously lethal and obsessive persona!! Stanwyck's intellectual ambiguity to this role was attributed to her overtly callous set of pecuniary priorities! Edward G. Robinson's character was the perennial voice of reason. Robinson was the legal eagle who would ultimately prevail in his tenacious quest to resolve all of these dubiously manufactured and felonious escapades! The final scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was an all-time noir classic. This last scene with MacMurray and Stanwyck was one of the best scenes of any movie whatsoever, definitely head to head with the extraordinary last scene of the movie ""The Killing"". A respected production company ranks this ending the sixth best ending of any and all movies ever produced! The dramatic ending to ""Double Indemnity"" was rated right above ""Casablanca"" and right below ""City Lights"". The heightened glamor to the final scene for MacMurray and Stanwyck exuded a zenith within the realm of the classic film noir mystique. The emphatic, yet subtle, overtone to the song ""Tangerine"" playing in the background, became a melodic element to this final scene which was conducive to a sexually sedate form of apocalyptic doom and despair! Throughout the entire duration of this movie, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck were always seducing each other with salacious innuendos! This ending wound up emulating a philosophical perspective used by writers of ancient Greek tragedies! Filming a movie in black and white is primarily advantageous to the quality of a film, as it obviates any disorientation to the impact of the characters' emotions!! AFI (AMERICAN FILM INSTITUTE) ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 29th best film out of the top 100 American movies ever made! This website ranks ""Double Indemnity"" 53rd out of the top 250 films ever produced. Last, but certainly not least, America's Writer's Guild East, ranks ""Double Indemnity"" the 26th best written script ever in the history of American films!! The director, Billy Wilder, does a tremendous job with consummating the aggregate megalomania and rancor to this movie. The acting was sensational. ""Double Indemnity"" was up for seven Academy Awards in 1944! Without question! ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest films ever created... FIVE STARS... PERFECT TEN!!!!"
c532c,"Jul 2, 2004",N/A,"I was impressed by the subtle changes Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder worked on Cain's novella. The book DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a fast, slick morality piece wherein an amoral hero (""Walter HUFF"") callously disregard notions of Good and Evil, only to find that Evil does exist (The things he discovers about Phyllis Dietrichson's past carry quite a shock.. and were omitted from the film.)and that he is sleeping with it. The ending is literally hellish and obviously influenced writers like Jim Thompson.The film, on the other hand, discards this to play up a love story between Edward G. Robinson and Fred MacMurray. Their mutual respect at the beginning of the film has turned into sad affection by the end, when Robinson lights MacMurray's cigarette, Fred says, ""...It was right across the desk from you,"" Ed answers, ""Closer than that, Walter,"" and Fred replies, ""I love you, too."" Tellingly, the exchange doesn't seem gay, just the expression of feelings between two men. Chandler knew how to write this and Wilder knew how to film it -- and very well indeed."
allar100,"Feb 26, 2004",10/10,"This is a dynamite piece of filmmaking by Billy Wilder.  Wilder is in my opinion a very underrated director, much like John Houston.  The acting is in top form from all of the players.  The cinematography is crisp, and beautiful.  The sound is nice and clear, and the direction is arguably some of Wilder's best.  However, the real star is the screenplay.  First off, it was taken from excellent source material.  James Cain is always great for a story where nobody wins out.  Check out The Postman Always Rings Twice for an example.  But it is Chandler who I think really put this one on the map. Chandler has a way with dialogue that makes it all ring in your ears.  The lines are smooth, and the characters always say something that makes me wish I could be that clever and smooth in everyday situations.  Chandler knows dialogue, Chandler knows LA, and Chandler knows how to deliver a story. Check out any of his novels, and you will see this.  This is a teamup that I really wish would have happened again.  Oh well.  If you don't mind voice over narration, then this is a film for you."
kanderhag,"May 5, 2003",10/10,I consider this to be one of the best movies ever made. The lines in the movie are classic and create an atmosphere that top most other movies. Fred MacMurray and the other actors are brilliant and the chemistry between Fred and Barbara is sparkling. All in all this is a great movie that everyone should see and be amazed by.
Kyle Westphal,"Jan 2, 1999",10/10,"""Double Indemnity"" is not only one of Wilder's best films, it is one of the greatest films of all time. Fred MacMurray is perfect for the role of Walter Neff, as well as Edward G. Robinson as Keyes. Wilder's direction is almost flawless, as well as the script with some great one-liners."
MicheBel,"Dec 30, 1998",9/10,"Just saw this movie again recently. I had forgotten how steamy the attraction was between the great Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray. That ankle bracelet....When he grabs her and kisses her, there's just nothing like it.And this movie, like all good noir, puts you in the steamy heat of Los Angeles.Great script! The ultimate noir, IMHO."

bob998,"Oct 4, 2020",6/10,"I failed to find in Double Indemnity a story that I could accept as a view of life, no matter how cold and cynical it is. When I watch The Maltese Falcon, The Big Sleep, Murder My Sweet, Scarlet Street and any number of other noirs, I always see an attempt to get away from the sordidness of the crimes, to catch a bit of sunlight amid the gloom, even some wild humour. Billy Wilder seems totally uninterested in the human condition, only in spinning his banal tale of insurance fraud. Does anybody really care about the policy? that it pays out double in certain circumstances? or do we just want to open a window to get some fresh air after it's over?
Robinson is just about perfect as the investigator with a little man inside him; Stanwyck, despite an ugly wig, delivers her lines with a silky and vicious smoothness that's very effective; Macmurray looks the part--we believe he could be a decent guy at heart who gets lost in a woman's treachery--but delivers his lines too fast, no doubt at Wilder's request."
marissas75,"Feb 4, 2006",9/10,"For years, I was entertained by film-noir homages/parodies like Garrison Keillor's ""Guy Noir, Private Eye"" and the Coens' ""The Man Who Wasn't There,"" but I'd never seen an authentic noir. I finally got my chance with ""Double Indemnity,"" which helped establish the genre as we know it. The expected elements are all here: Shadow-filled black-and-white cinematography. An ordinary man (Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray) who becomes an amoral criminal under the influence of a femme fatale (Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck). Abundant cynicism, pessimism, and fatalism. Tough, stylized dialogue, including voice-over narration with a kind of hard-edged poetry to it.However, because in the 21st century we see film noir parodies more frequently than the real thing, we've been conditioned to laugh at some of the excesses of the genre--especially this sort of narration. Thus, lines like ""How could I know that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?"" or ""I got to thinking about what cemeteries are for--they're for putting dead people in!"" strike us as much funnier than they were probably intended to be. Instead of helping create a dark, gritty atmosphere, they actually jolt us out of the movie by prompting our scoffing laughter.In short, ""Double Indemnity"" does a great job of establishing the rules of the world in which the story takes place, but we now have trouble accepting that world on its own terms. And I do believe that this movie was intended to have some humor to it--but of the grimly ironic kind, not the ""isn't this a little ridiculous?"" humor we find in it today.Still, there is much to admire about ""Double Indemnity."" It has a very strong plot--simply but elegantly constructed, and even though its general outlines get revealed within the first five minutes, the movie always remains interesting. The relationship between Walter and Phyllis is intriguingly ambiguous--it's not clear whether they are motivated by lust, greed, or something else entirely. (Roger Ebert's Great Movies essay has some noteworthy theories about this, and made me realize that this ambiguity is an asset, not a flaw.) Most impressive and unexpected is the character of insurance-claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Though Keyes functions like a detective, his role doesn't indulge in any ""film-noir detective"" clichés. Instead, he's the most real-seeming person in the movie: rumpled, gruff, blustering, detail-obsessed, highly conscientious, and very funny. And gradually, the film reveals that the relationship between Walter and Keyes is even more complex and interesting than that between Walter and Phyllis.""Double Indemnity"" will always be watched because of its role in establishing the conventions of film noir, but more importantly, it's still an entertaining movie--even if, sixty years later, it's sometimes entertaining for reasons the filmmakers never intended."
bigticket-36199,"Dec 12, 2025",10/10,"""Double Indemnity"" is a mysterious crime drama in which every movement feels seductive, every step is potentially dangerous, and every whisper carries a trace of poison. Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler adapted the screenplay from James M. Cain's 1936 novel of the same name.The story follows Walter Neff, an insurance salesman driving recklessly through the nighttime streets of Los Angeles. He moves with difficulty, pressing on a wound in his shoulder, before slipping into the empty office of his insurance company. He lights a cigarette and begins recording a confession for Barton Keyes, the claims manager. His narration carries us back one year earlier, straight to the doorstep of the Dietrichson home. Neff arrives to renew an automobile insurance policy, but since Mr. Dietrichson is not home, he engages in a brief yet dangerous flirtation with the man's alluring wife, Phyllis. Before long, Phyllis calls him back, wanting to inquire about securing a life insurance policy for her husband-without his knowledge...Billy Wilder fills the film with sharp black-and-white contrasts. The lighting is dim and cold, while the shadows hint at perilous decisions and hidden intentions. Close-ups reveal nervous gestures, abrupt movements, insincere smiles, and half-masked lies. The streets feel suffocating, and the characters' steps grow heavier, perfectly reflecting the film's claustrophobic tone. Staircases and elevators become symbols of both ascent and descent-each one leading to the same doomed path. The razor-sharp dialogue, exhilarating exchanges, and powerful narration linger long after the credits roll, seamlessly intertwined with Miklós Rózsa's tense and hypnotic score, which captivates the audience from the opening sequence.Thematically, the film exposes how a moral collapse can occur in a single moment of weakness. None of the protagonists are criminals by nature, yet they transform into criminals the instant their desires and ambitions collide. Their affair builds toward murder as its inevitable climax. Loneliness and money are merely fragments of the larger, darker game. The femme fatale dynamic is embodied in Phyllis with icy precision-completely detached from any notion of being a victim of family circumstances. She orchestrates relationships and outcomes; she has both the means and the will to do so. The emotional heart of the plot does not stem from romantic infatuation nor from the thrill of crime, but rather from a rare sincerity found in business friendship.Fred MacMurray is Walter Neff-a man in constant conflict with himself. As the narrator, he is cold and defiant until his last glimmer of hope, his voice vibrating with ironic exhaustion. His relationship with Phyllis rests on the tension between reason and desire, and his transformation-from a charming insurance salesman pulling the strings of a crime, to a wounded man trying to regain strength and time through confession-is one of the most compelling arcs in film noir.Barbara Stanwyck is Phyllis Dietrichson-the film's magnetic center. Her platinum wig, piercing gaze, and calculated smile radiate both allure and danger. Phyllis almost never raises her voice; she whispers, no matter the situation, pouring poison into every shared moment with gentle precision. Her expression during the murder scene is chillingly demonic.Edward G. Robinson is Barton Keyes-the heart and moral backbone of the story. Sharp-minded, deeply emotional, and almost brotherly in his affection toward Walter, Keyes stands as the living counterpoint to noir cynicism. He believes in justice, even in a world that has long abandoned it.Their performances are strongly supported by Jean Heather as the tender and sensitive Lola Dietrichson, Porter Hall as the comically nervous Mr. Jackson, Tom Powers as the gruff, work-worn Mr. Dietrichson, Byron Barr as the falsely rebellious Nino Zachetti and Richard Gaines as the blustering corporate figure Norton.""Double Indemnity"" is a film about fallen characters and a crime that lures them from the shadows. Told as a retrospective confession, the ending is almost known from the start-yet the suspense remains magnetic throughout. It is astonishing that, despite the strict censorship code of the era, the film did not win a single Oscar, and that Fred MacMurray was not even nominated. Regardless, this remains one of the finest films of the 1940s and a true masterpiece of the crime genre in the history of world cinema."
Lechuguilla,"Sep 2, 2007",10/10,"It's all story. There's not an ounce of superfluous material anywhere in this tightly plotted film classic about a wealthy middle-aged woman named Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) and an insurance salesman named Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray). The two of them conspire to kill Dietrichson's heavily insured husband, to cheat the insurance company out of a fortune. ""Double Indemnity"" is my all-time favorite noir film.The film's entertainment derives, in part, from the fact that we, as viewers, get to peek into their murderous scheme, and then watch both of them squirm, when their scheme starts to unravel. An undercurrent of paranoia permeates the plot, as the two incessantly look over their shoulders, as it were, to see if anyone has picked up on their plans or actions. And there are plenty of plot twists and turns. The dialogue is brisk, decisive, and memorable. Walter Neff gives one of my favorite lines: ""How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?""The film's excellent structure is organized around Neff's confessional, spoken into a Dictaphone and directed at his insurance company boss, Barton Keyes, played by the inimitable Edward G. Robinson. Much of the story is then told in a series of flashbacks from Neff's POV, as he narrates his liaison with Dietrichson.The film's terrific B&W cinematography, with its use of lighting texture and shadows, adds to the dark mood, and to an overall feeling of danger and deception. The visuals neatly correspond to the inner lives of the two main characters. The film's direction and casting are perfect. All of the acting is top notch. And the score is edgy, erotic, and at times appropriately menacing.There are a few minor plot holes. But who cares? The concept, story, characters, structure, and dialogue are so cinematically strong that they overwhelm any slight defects. And with topnotch film direction, casting, acting, cinematography, editing, and score, the result is a powerhouse film that will entertain viewers for at least the next ten thousand years."
claudio_carvalho,"Jul 29, 2007",10/10,"In 1938, the experienced salesman of the Pacific All Risk Insurance Co. Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) meets the seductive wife of one of his client, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwick), and they have an affair. Phyllis proposes to kill her husband Dietrichson (Tom Powers) to receive the prize of an accident insurance policy and Walter plots a scheme to receive twice the amount based on a double indemnity clause. When Mr. Dietrichson is found dead on the trails of a train, the police accepts the evidence of accidental death. However, the insurance analyst and Walter's best friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) does not buy the version and suspects that Phyllis has murdered her husband with the help of another man.In my opinion, Billy Wilder was the greatest director of Hollywood ever, directing many masterpieces including ""Double Indemnity"" among them. This is the second time that I see this magnificent film-noir, now on DVD recently released in Brazil (the first time was in the cable television, since this masterpiece has never been released on VHS in my country). The story and screenplay are stunning, disclosing a sordid story of lust, love, greed and betrayal. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwick and Edward G. Robinson have magnificent performances. The cinematography is simply spectacular, with an awesome use of lights and shadows and the music score completes one of the best movies Hollywood has ever produced. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Pacto de Sangue"" (""Pact of Blood"")"
McLANGwich,"Feb 13, 2011",7/10,"This film is not a timeless epic, it has aged badly. One whom describes it as a must for film-noir fans is probably doing so for all the wrong reasons. Sure, it has a snappy dialogue, the dame is desirable, the hero both lovable due to his sentimentalism, and exciting due to his high intelligence, the narration is very well done. The acting is not, contrary to popular opinion, that good. The main characters were not so hot, the best piece of acting was actually the portrayal of Keys, his character was almost Holmes-esque. The plot is very generic. Of course, this film may well have been one of the first to carry out such a plot, it may have been a real trend-setter, but I'm sorry that doesn't make it a classic by any stretch of the imagination. Regardless of how it received and how influential it was, it is not a great in its own genre. I adore film-noir and found this a let down."
bob-97,"Apr 9, 2001",10/10,"This wonderful film, with its brooding 1940's atmosphere and superb black-and-white photography (by John Seitz) is one of Hollywood's best. Fred MacMurray's performance, as the insurance man besotted with Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G Robinson's as his boss help make this film memorable. The turns of the plot and the highly-charged suspense ensure that the viewer will not be disappointed. Another of Billy Wilder's hits. Well done!"
HotToastyRag,"Sep 30, 2018",6/10,"Double Indemnity is one of the most famous film noir classics of all time, but I absolutely hate the beginning! Fred MacMurray, bleeding and panting, stumbles into his office and turns on a recorder. He starts his confession, and then the film goes back in time to relive his story as he tells it. I've never liked movies that go back in time because I've never been able to forget the beginning that has pretty much ruined the ending. It was in the back of my mind that Fred MacMurray will do something terrible and get very badly wounded-so the suspense of the flashback was killed for me. Also, this noir follows the classic pattern of having too much narration. I call it the ""It was a hot day in June, and I stepped on a piece of gum"" syndrome, partially because this movie's narration starts with discussing the month and the street names.While there's nothing wrong with Fred MacMurray's or Edward G. Robinson's performances, Barbara Stanwyck was terribly miscast. I think she's a fantastic actress in many different roles, but an irresistible femme fatale is not one of them. Lana Turner, yes, or Linda Darnell, but Barbara Stanwyck just doesn't pull off sexy in this movie as she did in other films like Clash by Night. Plus, her haircut in this film is bad enough to turn any man away, not attract them! I don't know why those ridiculous bangs were ever popular. Although, her anklet is a great accessory; I've since added a whole collection to my jewelry box.However, if you've never seen this classic and you like femme fatales, corny voice-over narration, and stupid men who are easily swayed to the dark side by a pair of legs, you should probably watch Double Indemnity. It does have some snappy dialogue:
""Suppose I bust out crying and put my head on your shoulder?""
""Try putting it on my husband's shoulder.""
""That tears it."""
miguelsanchez69,"Apr 2, 2003",5/10,"This is perhaps the most dated film besides reefer madness I've ever seen. This IS film noir though, low-key lighting galore, characters caught between good and evil, and a femme fatale. However thing like the protagonists repeated iterations of phrases such as ""Shut up and kiss me baby"" and other things that would likely get one sued for sexual harassment nowadays seem more funny than anything. He actually says ""baby"" referring to the female lead 37 times if I counted correctly. The dialogue is horribly dated. Interesting from a film history standpoint but as a movie, it's far more likely to elicit unintentional laughter than shock, empathy, or thrills."
Infofreak,"Jun 4, 2003",N/A,"James M. Cain's 'Double Indemnity' is one greatest crime stories ever written. It's not even novel length, only 80 pages or so, but close to perfect. I approached the movie version with some trepidation. I was aware that it was regarded as a film noir classic, and Billy Wilder is a great director, but I was put off by the casting of Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck in the lead roles. I grew up watching endless re-runs of 'My Three Sons' on TV so MacMurray was the last person I could imagine to play tough guy insurance salesman Walter Neff, and Stanwyck is one golden age actress I've never warmed to, and I don't think she was anywhere near as seductive enough to play Phyllis. However I needn't have worried, both actors are excellent, and screen legend Edward G. Robinson steals every scene he is in. A few things were changed from Cain's original novella by Wilder and collaborator Raymond Chandler, especially the ending, which is nowhere near as dark and pessimistic as the book version, but I have no complaints, as a movie it is close to perfect. 'Double Indemnity' is without doubt one of the best crime movies I've ever seen, up there with 'Rififi', 'Out Of The Past', 'The Killing', and a handful of others. Highly recommended."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 19, 2024",8/10,"""Double Indemnity,"" directed by Billy Wilder, is an iconic film that not only defines the film noir genre but also remains a paragon of suspenseful storytelling and character complexity. Released in 1944, this classic thriller, based on James M. Cain's novella, weaves a tale of greed, betrayal, and moral ambiguity that captivates audiences to this day.The film stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, an insurance salesman who becomes embroiled in a deadly scheme after encountering the alluring Phyllis Dietrichson, played masterfully by Barbara Stanwyck. Stanwyck's performance is riveting, as she embodies the quintessential femme fatale, blending charm with menace in a way that draws both Neff and the audience into her web of deceit. The chemistry between MacMurray and Stanwyck is palpable, making their dangerous dance of seduction and manipulation all the more compelling.Billy Wilder's direction is nothing short of brilliant. He meticulously crafts each scene with tension and elegance, utilizing shadows and stark lighting to enhance the film's atmosphere. The screenplay, co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is sharp and filled with witty dialogue that adds depth to the characters while maintaining an underlying sense of foreboding. The clever use of voice-over narration immerses viewers in Neff's plight, making their journey through the moral quagmire all the more intimate and engrossing.At its core, ""Double Indemnity"" serves as a compelling exploration of the darker sides of human nature. The characters' motivations, driven by ambition and lust, lead them down a treacherous path where trust is shattered and the line between right and wrong blurs. The film's intricate plot twist and chilling resolution leave audiences pondering the consequences of their own choices long after the credits roll.What truly sets ""Double Indemnity"" apart is its influence on the noir genre and its enduring legacy in American cinema. It has inspired countless filmmakers and remains a touchstone for those interested in the art of storytelling.

For any film lover, this masterpiece is essential viewing-a brilliant exploration of love, greed, and the human condition."
Andyeightyseven,"Oct 1, 2004",9/10,"This is a good film noir movie that is compelling to watch and leaves you thinking. I watched this film first in my film studies class at college and i thought when it came on ""oh no"" black and white its going to be boring but the fact is that it wasn't, the incredible storyline alone is so interesting the actors especially Fred Mac Murray are excellent picking Mac Murray out in particular a slick cool insurance salesman who is a bit of a womanizer!!.I did however think that they would have got away with that kind of murder, i really think it would have been hard to find out the exact details of that case and then find the murderer or murderers. The film on a whole reminds me of The Godfather or an old classic murder drama, the dark rooms the fast New York accent talk and the fascinating dress sense (not to mention the way Neff can light a match like that so slick)!!Overall a very enjoyable film for anyone of any age, it will not offend anyone and is one classic that must be seen9/10"
dtb,"Sep 16, 2006",10/10,"The super deluxe 2-disc DVD edition of the 1944 film noir classic DOUBLE INDEMNITY (DI) rocks! Director/co-screenwriter Billy Wilder's flair with suspense and black humor works so perfectly with James M. Cain's novel about adulterous lovers plotting to murder the woman's husband and scam the man's insurance company, that it even improves on the book (which I read years ago).The dark tone and scandalous subject matter freaked out Hollywood so much that it took 9 years to get DI from the printed page to the big screen. Fred MacMurray was the only leading man in Hollywood with the guts to take the role of insurance salesman-turned-murderer Walter Neff, though even MacMurray needed convincing at first. None of the other in-demand male stars of the period wanted Barbara Stanwyck's conniving, money-loving, hubby-offing temptress Phyllis Dietrichson to make a chump out of him on screen. Their loss! (I'd first seen MacMurray when I was a kid. Back then, he was best known to my generation as a Disney movie star and the lovable dad of TV's MY THREE SONS, so it was quite a revelation to me when I saw him playing underhanded types in DI, THE APARTMENT, and THE CAINE MUTINY. MacMurray had more range than he got credit for!)MacMurray and Stanwyck are dynamite in this, one of the most gleefully, unapologetically black-hearted films noir ever made. Their dialogue, especially in the first half of the movie, contains many of my fave movie lines of all time (if I start quoting them all, I'll pretty much be transcribing most of the script). The chemistry between Stanwyck and MacMurray blazes like the Chicago Fire as the wily, spellbinding Phyllis draws Walter into her web. As Richard Schickel points out in one of the DVD's 2 excellent audio commentaries, Stanwyck's Phyllis is always reacting in the moment, so you never can tell whether she means a word she says, making her all the more fascinating. What cynical Sam Spade says to the equally slippery Brigid O'Shaughnessy in THE MALTESE FALCON could also apply to the quicksilver Phyllis: she's good, awful good!Edward G. Robinson is DI's crabby yet kind-hearted Voice of Reason in his portrayal of Barton Keyes, the Pacific All-Risk Insurance Company's ace Claims Manager. As Keyes, Robinson is irresistible, with his zeal for detail, the ""little man"" in his gut giving him indigestion every time an insurance claim seems fishy, and his gruff affection for Walter. Heck, at times, there's more tenderness between Walter and Keyes than there is between Walter and Phyllis! :-) IMO, the biggest crime in DI was the failure to nominate either of the male leads for an Oscar, especially scene-stealing Robinson, though the Academy was smart enough not to overlook the mesmerizing Stanwyck. (For that matter, Robinson was never nominated for an Oscar for any of his superb performances. He was eventually given one of those special career Oscars, or as we like to call them, the ""Yikes, He's So Old He Could Croak Any Minute and He Still Hasn't Gotten An Oscar? *D-OH!*"" award. :-)DI boasts plenty of wonderful character bits, too -- really, there isn't a bum performance in the bunch! Our household's DI faves include Fortunio Bonanova as Garlopis, whose phony claim Keyes chews to bits ""like a slice of rare roast beef;"" and Porter Hall as Jackson from Medford, Oregon, the jovial train traveler who innocently throws a wrench into the murder plot when he turns up on the train's Observation Car while Walter pretends to be Phyllis' injured, crutch-bound hubby. (Speaking of the crutches, is the opening credit sequence with the silhouetted, fedora'd figure on crutches one of the coolest credit sequences of all time, or what?). Any fans of THE THING FROM ANOTHER WORLD who might be reading this shouldn't blink when Walter lets Lola (Jean Heather) into his office at one point, or you'll miss Douglas Spencer (with hair!) as Walter's associate, Lou Schwartz, coming out at the same time.If you love the movie (and why wouldn't you? :-), you'll go gaga over the nifty commentary tracks and extras. Among other things, we learn about the censorship issues in bringing Cain's juicy, lurid tales to the big screen. For example, there were several European film versions of THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE (including Luchino Visconti's OSSESSIONE, which works very well in its down-to-earth way and recently turned up on Turner Classic Movies) before Hollywood brought it to the big screen with John Garfield and Lana Turner in 1946. We're also told about how the different writing/working styles of Wilder and Raymond Chandler (who was hired to help adapt the story when Cain was under contract elsewhere and Wilder's then-collaborator Charles Brackett nixed the dark material) turned the experience into a collaboration made in hell. For the record, I wouldn't be surprised if Chandler was mostly to blame, since there are similar stories about him being just as tough to work with during Alfred Hitchcock's 1951 screen adaptation of Patricia Highsmith's STRANGERS ON A TRAIN. Hitch eventually brought in Ben Hecht's assistant Czenzi Ormonde to finish/polish the script when Chandler took a hike. Disc 2 contains the 1973 TV movie remake of DOUBLE INDEMNITY, which is worth watching if only to appreciate how much better the original is! This DVD set belongs in your collection!"
Arkaan,"Oct 12, 1999",8/10,"Wilder has proved time and time again his versatility and style.  His first major hit, Double Indeminty, was a precursor to a career which includes heavy drama (The Lost Weekend) to comedy (Some Like it Hot).The film noir, featuring incredible sex appeal between MacMurray and Stanwyck(who deserved an Oscar).  From seeing the anklet, to when he brutally kisses her, to her icy stare, she is  one of the sexiest females on film.The story has been done many times since (Body Heat, The Last Seduction), but Double Indemnity stands head and shoulders above the rest."
jcholguin,"Jul 27, 2002",8/10,"Single man falls in love with a woman but doesn't realize that this woman has other plans. Fred MacMurray as salesman Walter Neff, alias single man is perfect as the man used. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson, unhappy married woman with unloving husband plays the part expertly. The acting abilities of MacMurray are displayed as he plays a killer and a womanizer is so different from his ""Steven Douglas"" character of his TV show ""My Three Sons."" He smokes, lites matches with his finger, and simply enjoys his flirting with Phyllis. He constantly reminds her of ""his plan"" to free her of her husband, with 100k as a reward unaware that the whole time it is ""she"" that has pulled him into her trap, much like a spider to the fly. Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the man trying to prove a murder with the help of his ""little man"" is really great. As with all perfect plans, there are little problems that can destroy the plans but this movie ends with the problem walking around with two legs, wearing an ankle bracelet. Poor Fred, taken in by a woman. Wonderful movie to watch."
The Movie Buff,"Mar 4, 2002",10/10,"This movie was fantastic. Definitely one of the twenty best films of all-time, maybe 10.  The plot was so good that it even put Hitchcock to shame. This is one of the few times that a movie did justice to the book. In this case the movie might have even been better than the book. This is one of those movies where I cannot find a flaw, anywhere in it. In a sense it was a perfect movie.  There is not one genre to define this movie.  It has romance, crime, noir, mystery, with emphasis on the last 3 in heavy dosages. All I can say is, for those who haven't seen it, you don't know what your missing."
awblundell,"Aug 10, 2002",9/10,"This movie has everything, the laconic narration, the dark look - low lighting and seedy apartments, the femme fatale -  Barbara Stanwyck is perfect in the role, the descent and eventual destruction of the central character.

wryterman,"Sep 16, 2024",4/10,"One thing put me off this film almost from the start: I find it hard to believe that two strangers, no matter how attracted to each other, would agree to commit premeditated murder together. I certainly expected more knowing Raymond Chandler wrote the screenplay. Beyond this overwhelming plot flaw, I see why this move is on the IMDb Top 250 Best Movie list. The performances are excellent, with the highlight being Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes. But it's not one I'd recommend, unless you're a completionist like me, and it's on a list you're working your way through. It only has a small cast, but it's neither too many or too few characters."
dencar_1,"May 17, 2005",N/A,"The premier ""film noir"" entrée, DOUBLE INDEMNITY stands as the model for the genre. Told entirely in flashback, it is the grim, yet seductive story of a life insurance agent who falls for a treacherously sultry married woman plotting to do her husband in for the payoff. DOUBLE INDEMNITY is nothing less than a requirement for anyone who asks, ""What is film noir?"" For all the ingredients are present: the cold-hearted criminal plot, the adulterous romance, the step-by-step implementing of the deed, the anxiety-ridden moments as a steadfast mind zeroes in on the guilty parties, and the inevitability of the final justice---all filmed in grim black and white.Did Fred MacMurray ever have a greater moment in his acting career playing Walter Neff, the Los Angeles insurance agent knocked out by a bored housewife who ropes him into her diabolical web? Did Barbara Stanwyck ever really overcome the powerful persona of Mrs. Dietrichson, the calculating murderess standing at the top of the stairs in a bath towel? And could there have been a better screen writer for DOUBLE INDEMNITY than the assiduous Raymond Chandler (THE BIG SLEEP, FAREWELL, MY LOVELY, THE LONG GOODBYE), who remains the unequaled master of the Los Angeles detective genre?Not to be outdone, Edward G. Robinson turns in a yeoman's performance as Keyes, MacMurray's boss. Keyes is a walking encyclopedia of fraudulent insurance claims and is nearly infallible in his ability to sniff out the rotten stench of not-so-accidental death. In one memorable scene, Keyes reduces his own superior to pulp as he lectures him that ""no one ever committed suicide by throwing themselves off a train moving at 5 miles per hour."" He cites the statistics of death by poisoning, drowning, lightning strikes, and electrocution straight off the top of his head. At what point Keyes becomes suspicious of Neff is never quite clear; but he is certainly suspicious of Stanwyck from the start--and Neff had taken Stanwyck's life insurance policy just before her husband supposedly went off the caboose.One certain proof that a detective drama is succeeding is the identification the audience has with the villains. A cold-blooded murder has been committed, yet we somehow squirm nervously for the perpetrators hoping their plot succeeds. The epitome of this identification occurs in the scene after Neff impersonates Dietrichson on the train. MacMurray races back to the car where Stanwyck awaits and the car engine stalls. He tries to turn it over again and again. We actually want the car to start!The only soft spot that exists in this sensationally crafted Ramond Chandler script is MacMurray's character transformation. He simply evolves from cavalier life insurance salesman to murderer far too soon after falling for Stanwyck. Moreover, Neff's seemingly air-tight plot to erase Dietrichson materializes a bit too quickly and precisely in his mind.What is central is that in the end it isn't Neff's boss Keyes who throws the light on the murder--it's the adulterous relationship between MacMurray and Stanwyck itself. No one other than the plotters themselves was needed to undo the evil, for the villainous collaboration contained the seeds for its own destruction. In the end, the lovers turn on one another and the twisted relationship destroys both of them.DOUBLE INDEMNITY is simply one of Hollywood's movie detective classics. And anyone who fails to include DOUBLE INDEMNITY in an all-time list of greats knows very little about films.Dennis Caracciolo"

I think one of my biggest enjoyments was seeing Fred MacMurray as a bad guy. I have seen this guy in many shows and movies as the good guy for many years. The best one in the flick (in my opinion) has got to be Edward G. Robinson, classic, classic indeed."
sonny_1963,"May 22, 2005",10/10,"This is my favorite movie. I think Fred MacMurray gives his best performance ever. Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson also stand out. The script, co-written by the film's director, Billy Wilder, and mystery author Raymond Chandler is crisp and tough. MacMurray's lines are memorable.It is a story of greed, fear and lust. Greed so intense that it drives the mild-mannered MacMurray to murder. And fear, grasping at his senses, that it permeates his ability to think reasonably. And, of course, lust, the kind of lust for the equally bad Stanwyck that drove him to commit evil in the first place.If you like old films, especially film noir, see this one. It is absolutely perfect."
moonspinner55,"Jan 17, 2009",7/10,"Fred MacMurray is a southern California insurance salesman who stops by a client's house one afternoon to renew a contract and meets the client's wife, an anklet-wearing, glinty-eyed dame with blonde hair styled like a lascivious doll. They flirt a little, but when she starts inquiring about taking out a life insurance policy on hubby without him knowing about it, MacMurray gives her the brush-off; no matter, she looks him up in the phone book and winds up on his doorstep! Canny, clever murder-plot concocted by director Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, via James M. Cain's novel ""Three of a Kind"". Cain, who also penned ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (which this plot has a faint trace of), masterfully knew how to create sultry, no-nonsense broads who get what they want, and Wilder's handling of Barbara Stanwyck in this role is sensational. MacMurray, on the other hand, always looks about to blanch, and his character (savvy on customer relations) falls prey to Stanwyck mighty quickly. As Fred's boss, Edward G. Robinson does well with a sketchy character, though his wordy summations and 'intuitions' are just plot contrivances, pushing this story along to its inevitable conclusion. ""Double Indemnity"" is not without flaws, and has become overrated in the previous two decades, though it is ripe with scintillating, low-life dialogue and does build suspense even though we all know where these characters are headed--to the cemetery! *** from ****"
saalehab,"Dec 17, 2015",7/10,"Very suspenseful, and well done. I wouldn't call it a new favorite, but it was still a good movie. The acting was good, very dramatic, and the actors had really good chemistry as lovers. It was appropriately dark as a crime movie, and there was good use of light and shadows in scenes that were serious or dark. There were also a few good scenes of cinematography that were shot, it really added to the suspense of the movie, there was one part where the woman was so close to the man that wanted to arrest her, only separated by a door it was full of that thriller feeling while watching it, really directed and shot well. The entire movie was thrilling and I would recommend it."
Camera-Obscura,"Feb 10, 2007",N/A,"For me, Wilder is somewhat of a hit-or-miss affair. I cannot get enough of SUNSET BOULEVARD (1950), truly a one-of-a-kind film, that seems to get richer with each passing year. LOST WEEKEND (1945) also holds up very well to this day-and-age, but few of his other films did. But this campy piece of murder, double-crossing and intrige by Wilder, I never cared for.The set-up? $50,000. Insurance policy. Double crossing. Adultery. Murder. Und so weiter, und so weiter... the usual noir ingredients. Watching this sixty years later, with Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck strutting their way through the now utterly familiar noir plot line, whispering seductive lines too each other, it's non-too-exciting anymore. Probably a victim of its own success, but anyone getting excited over the plot hasn't lived the last sixty years, so what is it that's still appealing? The dialog? Stanwyck? Edward G. Robinson? I never understood what the appeal of Barbara Stanwyck was. In THE LADY EVE (1941) I positively loathed her brooding persona, she had zero sex appeal. She just annoys the hell out of me, I can't help it. There's also something about MacMurray's continuous voice-over makes that makes me fall asleep each time I see this. It probably has something to do with the timbre in his voice. I never even managed to watch this in one stretch.Camera Obscura --- 4/10"

jhclues,"Sep 4, 2002",10/10,"This film hits the screen like a well trained Olympic runner with comfortable shoes who can feel the gold around his neck before his heels are even in the blocks.  It's what they call `film noir,' because from the opening frames you know that the guy doing the talking is looking at a no-win situation, that he's going to lose and lose big.  Oh, sure, he knows it now; everything you're about to see has already happened, his goose has already been cooked, and now he's going to tell you about it, let you in on what went down, how it went south and why.  He'll even give you the heads up on the irony of the whole thing right out of the chute, how like our Olympic runner he could feel the gold in his hand before the ink on the insurance paper was even dry-- yeah, that's right it was an insurance scam, see, and a good one too-- all the bases were covered and checked for chinks, but in the end-- and here's where the irony comes in-- in the end, he didn't get the money and he didn't even get the girl who put the whole thing in motion.`Double Indemnity,' a classic `noir' thriller in anybody's book, was directed by Billy Wilder, a guy who knows all the ins and outs, ups and downs and double shuffles of the business better than a short jockey on a tall horse.  He's the `go to' guy in a game like this, because he knows all the angles, he knows the lingo and more than that, he has the insights to make it play out like it was the real deal; this guy knows what makes people tick, what motivates them and it's an ace up his sleeve that he plays like a trump card when the chips are down or even if a stack or two looks like they're about to go over.  He knows the whole layout, from top to bottom and side to side because he wrote the script along with another guy you might have heard about, Raymond Chandler, another member of the club who just happens to know his way around the block and back again.  This is a guy who doesn't need a road map to tell him which way to go; he's the guy who `invented' the map.  And when a couple of the boys like Wilder and Chandler get together to make it up and put it down, it's as good as in the can, especially when they're getting the skinny in the first place from James M. Cain, who it just so happens wrote the novel this movie's based on.  Besides which, they got the names Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck down on the dotted lines, the ones that count, the ones that say they're the ones who are the stars of the picture, see?  Let's face it, that's like having Ruth, Mantle and Mays in the outfield at the same time with Sandy Koufax on the mound and Don Drysdale warming up behind him in the bull pen.  The opposition might as well climb back on the bus and take the long ride on the short pier, because Wilder's team already has the big `W' next to their name in the box score.Like I said before, and I'm going to say it again because if there's one thing I've learned during my time on the planet it's that sometimes people just don't listen, or maybe there's some things they just don't want to hear.  But like I was saying, this story's about an insurance scam, a dirty deal that all starts when Mr. Walter Neff (MacMurray), a salesman with a head a couple of sizes too big for his hat, makes a house call and runs into a dame, and not just any dame; her name is Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck), a woman with the kind of beauty that stops traffic, turns heads and makes monkeys out of guys like Neff, guys that think they got it knocked when all the time they're standing in quicksand and don't even know it till they're in up to their ears and gasping for that last breath.  But that's the name of the game; Neff isn't the first guy to find his tiller on the wrong side of the mule because of a pretty face, moist lips and the sweet smell of perfume that sells it all like the siren's song, and he won't be the last to have the deal closed by promises of something that never will be and never has been, though it's victims are heaped along the side of the carefree highway like mounds of bark dust just waiting to be spread or lost in the wind.Maybe that's not a pretty picture, but everything can't be a glossy print on Kodak paper, and you can take that to the bank because history's full of stories like this.  Let's face it, Monet didn't have good eyesight, Van Gogh was down an ear and neither Mona nor her sister Lisa knew how to smile.  And when a pair like Walter and Phyllis get together to cook a stew, there's always a Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) waiting in the wings for them to screw up, take a wrong step or flash a tell that attracts a guy with a nose for fraud like a metal rod drawing lightening.It takes some real `pros' to play the game at this level, and that's Wilder's team all right; but he needed some support to win this big, and he got it from the likes of Porter Hall (Mr. Jackson), Jean Heather (Lola), Tom Powers (Mr. Dietrichson) and Byron Barr (Nino).  This film will give you the kind of ride a Six Flags park could only dream of, and that's what makes `Double Indemnity' one you're going to remember like a first kiss on a warm night in summer.  10/10."
JLRFilmReviews,"Aug 2, 2016",10/10,"Barbara Stanwyck is unhappily married but not helpless in this hypnotic Billy Wilder film classic, ""Double Indemnity,"" based on the James Cain novel. Stanwyck is hardly ever helpless. She plays the quintessential femme-fatale, as she seduces insurance salesman Fred MacMurray into her web and entices him to kill for her. The target is her husband. That's all you really need to know. But why am I reviewing this with so many reviews already? #1: To be among the masses who say and agree that this is arguably the best film noir ever, and #2 : To sing the praises of Edward G. Robinson! Many people will invest a lot of time in Billy Wilder's stylized technique of movie-making and his attention of each minute detail and the incredible dialogue and script, co-written by Raymand Chandler, and perhaps Fred MacMurray's best performance on screen, but while all this is true and all these factors come together to make a perfect film. One of the biggest factors is Edward's contribution to this film. The words on the page burst forth, when Edward says them. His tirades about death statistics bring life and breath to the film in contrast to the other two, who are somberly serious and only thinking about how to get out their problems alive! The balance of ""hammy"" Edward and his outbursts conveying joy, revelation, frustration and feeling about his job and his ""little man"" and ""Papa,"" solving each mystery, along with the walking dead characters make for a mesmerizing movie experience. I have praised the always professional and exceptional Stanwyck before in other reviews. To go on any further with anything would be redundant; this is Billy Wilder and his cast's finest hour."
elvircorhodzic,"Jun 27, 2016",10/10,"DOUBLE INDEMNITY is a movie in which the atmosphere, suspense and power of dialogue break new ground. The story is basically a cold, even in scenes of heated fake passion. Murder is mutual pleasure and greatest passion. Insurance salesman who embarks on a dangerous game of love with a femme fatale who persuades him to murder. The truth is quite the marketing savvy. Fiction is all too appropriate. Psychological game and fear of the truth is perhaps the most realistic described.Deception is the key word.The film is an example of the genre. The story is strong and interesting. The dialogues are so rich that it is simply cut into the memory. The script is special, and I think it's just one of the great elements in this film.Women incapable of emotion and love. Man created for the perfect crime. Maybe the other way around. Romance is certainly not convincing. I have a feeling that the main characters are poisoned with psychological tendencies and perfect moments. Love and money are only intermediaries. I've already stated what the real pleasure.Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, his performance is very good. Narration through flashbacks is somewhat uncertain. I think he works too freely in the film. Such a person rarely falls under the charms of some beauty. He is capable of killing and planned murder. The stillness of his body is amazing. Changes in the tension, excitement or disappointment they feel in his voice. Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis Dietrichson was really great. Phyllis is not a happy woman, nor ever can be. The destruction of everything around her mode of existence. What has led to such an emotional state? Here's a little characterization. Stanwyck is blonde !? I am unlike most positively surprised. Yes, ankles are sexy but still .... Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes acts a bit unreal. As it is always one step ahead. I'd copied dedication to his work. Difficult and irritable character with specific humor.Intriguing, brilliant and at times disturbing crime game. I'm thrilled."
Flups21,"Mar 23, 2011",10/10,"From the moment it starts, you know you're in for an incredible movie. At almost 70 years old, this movie still has one of the most incredible and memorable scripts. There are so many memorable lines. Those delivered by Fred MacMurray are the most believable. Less than two minutes in to my first viewing of this movie I knew I was in for something special. That was about 15 years ago and after dozens of viewings, I know I will never tire of it. A true American classic.One of the first, and still best, films de noir. It doesn't get much better than this.It's still a ""honey of an anklet, Mrs. Dietrichson!"""
krorie,"Nov 8, 2005",10/10,"This is Billy Wilder's masterpiece. Though ""Sunset Boulevard"" is a great movie, it has a few script holes that ""Double Indemnity"" does not have. For example, in ""Double Indemnity,"" Walter Neff admits at the beginning of the movie that he has killed a man. He does this by dictating into a machine. He then proceeds to tell how it happened. This could very likely take place in the real world. In ""Sunset boulevard"" a corpse is floating in a pool; the corpse begins through narration to tell how it ended up dead. This is a major flaw since dead people don't tell tales.The only other film noir thriller that even comes close to capturing the essence of the genre is ""Murder, My Sweet."" The lines in that movie are almost as clever and memorable as the lines in ""Double Indemnity."" Interesting that the two were released the same year (1944), one based on a James M. Cain novel, the other on a Raymond Chandler novel. There are so many catchy lines in ""Double Indemnity"" that aid the viewer in understanding the inner workings and machinations of the characters that they fill almost the entire film. IMDb provides the best lines under ""quotes."" My favorite because it so defines the relationship between Neff and his boss Barton Keyes is toward the end when Neff stands before Keyes totally exposed. Neff states,""Know why you couldn't figure this one, Keyes? I'll tell ya. 'Cause the guy you were looking for was too close. Right across the desk from ya."" Keyes knowingly replies, ""Closer than that, Walter."" The father, son relationship of the two men is now broken forever and the tragedy of the severed bond is apparent.Everyone involved in this movie both before the camera and behind the camera give their inspired all to make this film one of the greatest in cinema history. True, it may rightfully be classified film noir, but the total picture transcends labeling. It is so much more than just the best film noir movie. The three leads could be no better. They play their parts perfectly. The much underrated Fred MacMurray who was so often relegated to minor features was a gifted actor. He stays on top of it all and truly equals the inspired performances of Barbara Stanwyck, the ultimate femme fatale, and Edward G. Robinson in his best role ever. Edward G. Robinson plays the penultimate insurance actuary. He knows the statistics inside and out. He can recognize a false claim almost immediately. Neff knew this but he let another part of his body rather than his brain do his thinking for him. He is completely blinded by love and lust. And what a name given him by Wilder, Walter Neff, so common it compares with the name Willy Loman for some of the same reasons. He is too weak to withstand the wily maneuvering of this cold, callous yet greedy woman, who knows how to shake that thing. He is doomed from the start. In the end everyone loses, even Keyes. He will never be the same man again. He cannot dismiss Neff the way he dismissed all the other frauds and fakes. A part of himself has been removed permanently."
bjon,"Aug 29, 2005",6/10,"Although I enjoyed this movie a lot, I found some interesting flaws in it as well. For instance, Fred MacMurray seemed to try too hard to be a bad guy. I adore Barbara Stanwyck, but who did her hair? It looked like a poorly styled wig. This film certainly was fodder for a Carol Burnett parody, if for nothing else, her hair. The only believable character I found was that of Lola, the victim's daughter. Edward G. Robinson was great, thus I felt that the part was written for him. Now the part of the casual observer on the train from Oregon seemed to be terribly stereotyped, and the racist overtones as with Mr. Galopus and the ""colored woman who comes in twice a week"" didn't excite me either, but I guess that was what it was like in those days.Now for the clipped part. The dialogue seemed very quick and unnatural. It sounded like everyone was reading from the script while they were acting. This may have something to do with Wilder's penchant for ""tight"" scripts, especially in his early films. I must say that he improved later on in such films as ""Sunset Boulevard."" I did enjoy the scenes of Los Angeles in the 1940's though. It's a period piece to be admired."
shafatqadri,"Mar 6, 2009",10/10,"Paramount Studio's 1944 release Double Indemnity is one of the best examples of true-to-form film noir. The plot of the film is straightforward. Fueled by greed, a wife decides to take out an insurance policy on her unsuspecting husband, with plans of murdering him for the proceeds. The policy contains a double indemnity clause, which will pay twice the policy amount in the event of death by accident. To make her plan succeed, she enlists the help of an accomplice to help murder her spouse and make it seem accidental.Adapted from a novel by James M. Cain, Double Indemnity is loosely based on the real-life Snyder-Gray murder case of 1927, in which a New York housewife persuaded her young lover to commit murder. The woman had taken out a double indemnity life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. The murder succeeded but the killers were caught and executed the following year. Just as actual events influenced the making of this film, Double Indemnity has influenced numerous movies based on the same premise, the most notable of which are 1946's The Postman Always Rings Twice and 1981's Body Heat.The film stars Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff, a fast-talking insurance salesman, attempting to pull the perfect fraud job. It is Fred MacMurray who is narratting the film. Of course he didn't start out with that idea - it all stated when he met, and immediately fell for, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). From there the tale she spins of her unhappy marriage, complicated by a tempestuous relationship with stepdaughter Lola, takes him on the slippery slope to crime. With his extensive knowledge of the insurance business, nothing can stop Walter from covering his tracks ingeniously except the analytical skills of his friend, the fraud investigator Barton Keyes.Frequently told in flashbacks, this movie is utterly compelling from the word go. It's interesting to ponder whether this film could have had the same impact if it had been shot in colour - but I don't think so. The filming is spot on, the camera angles, use of shadow and perspectives on the actors all add to the tension of the film. The screen does sometimes get so dark as to be impossible to tell what's going on in a couple of scenes, but this is done deliberately so as to add to the suspense.The film is very wordy, as so many films of the era were and the dialogue is often brilliant. Billy Wilder's direction is another part of the key to this film's being in the IMDb Top 250 Movies of All Time list and also features in the Top 50 among the IMDb Film Noir list in fact at # 3 when I last saw it. There are moments of humour to lighten the mood and scenes of compelling drama / intrigue / emotion. With the excellent acting, awesome script and breathtaking art direction / cinematography it makes one of the best films of all time in a lot of peoples' list - including mine.In case you didn't know (I didn't), the term ""Double Indemnity"" refers to an insurance clause where a double payment is handed out if someone whose life is insured dies in an unusual manner. Theoretically of course the chances of this happening are remote, meaning little danger of them ever having to pay it out and cases when someone has died in this manner shortly after taking out a life insurance policy would automatically be viewed as suspicious. The way Walter covers his tracks, and the way Barton uncovers them, are quite brilliant and show (to a layman at least) a deep knowledge of the insurance business.Double Indemnity was nominated for no less that seven Oscars; sadly it didn't win a single one. But from 1944, it's popularity has increased year after year and when you talk of noir movies DOuble Indemnity instantly come to ones mind."
esteban1747,"Nov 1, 2002",7/10,"Interesting plot of this thriller. An attractive woman (Stanwyck) married to a man much older than her, who was previously married or was widow, with a daughter from his first marriage, live in a very tense relations. She did not want to continue living with his husband and detested his daughter. At this point, an agent from an insurance company (MacMurray) thrived as an 'angel' for Stanwyck, he proposed different assurances, one of them foresaw insurance in case of an accidental death, but he also felt in love with Stanwyck. This passion led to a planned murder that was committed nearly perfectly. But another intelligent person (Edward G. Robinson), the boss of MacMurray in the insurance company, step by step started to discover the plot for murder. This is a film with very modest means if you compare with those presently in use, but it is of a very high quality. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray showed their class, but the best acting came from that 'monster' of the screen named Edward G. Robinson, who acted perfectly. Looking the way he did one may think that he was not an actor but simply the real boss of the insurance company."
jldmp1,"Sep 22, 2007",3/10,"This particular relic serves one purpose today: to show just how far we've advanced as viewers of movies in terms of our expectations. This may have been definitive film-noir in its day. Now the distance between this movie and the ubiquitous use of noir in our time is as distant as the dictaphone within is to today's digital recordings.Surely, it's hard to get much purer than ""Double Indemnity"". It announces in undiluted terms how it's all about the individual caught up in the machinery of uncaring Fates. The men are openly and piggishly sexist. The women are decorations...but there's no actual sexuality this deep in the Code period. Not a drop of irony anywhere.And so I think we expect a lot more than this now. At least I know I do. What I expect is a movie that visually plays the game with me, and is not just about a game perpetrated on the world of the movie's characters that we passively observe.This is obsolete. I'll go with any one of this movie's many descendants, starting with ""Body Heat""."
Snow Leopard,"May 18, 2001",N/A,"The classic ""Double Indemnity"" is one of the greatest of all ""film noir"" movies, and it has everything you could ask for: great acting, interesting characters, an imaginative plot, and lots of tension.  Put all this under the direction of the incomparable Billy Wilder, and it's one of the best films of all time.The three lead actors all give terrific performances.  Fred MacMurray is at the center of everything, as an insurance salesman tempted in more than one way by an alluring customer (Barbara Stanwyck).  MacMurray's character is torn between what Stanwyck offers, and his close relationship with his company's claims manager, played by Edward G. Robinson.  MacMurray is excellent in portraying his struggle between his desire to grab the illicit pleasures offered by Stanwyck, and his deep admiration for Robinson as a person and as an example.  Stanwyck in turn is perfect in her role as a woman who uses everything she has to get what she wants.  Robinson's performance may be the best of all in bringing his character to life - a straight-arrow, perceptive and diligent worker who also comes across as a thoroughly enjoyable character.The three leads are so good that the film gets away with some occasionally dated (overly ""hard-boiled"") dialogue in some of the voice-overs and confrontation scenes.  The actors were in such good form, though, that they were able to make any line sound pretty good.The rest of the cast all have much smaller parts, but they all fulfill their functions well, especially Porter Hall in one of his many fine character roles, and Richard Gaines, who is perfect as a clueless insurance company executive.Wilder uses his skilled touch to complete the atmosphere of intrigue and suspense.  The overall result is a great film noir whose characters and tensions are as alive today as they were in the 40's.  It is worth watching over and over."
pyrocitor,"Aug 25, 2008",10/10,"Some cinematic matches seem made in heaven, no matter how discordant they may prove on Earth. Such was unquestionably the case with legendary writer/director Billy Wilder and author Raymond Chandler, when paired up to craft a film adaptation of a dark, seedy novel by James M. Caine, dealing with such rich cinematic potential as deception, double-crossing and murder. While the feuding between Wilder and Chandler was legendary, each despising each other's methods and taking any possible opportunity to ridicule each other, their cinematic concoction, Double Indemnity, was even more legendary. One of the most pitch perfect noir thrillers of all time, each component of the film fits together seamlessly to create a flawless slice of dark movie magic which has lost none of its atmospheric punch and poignancy when viewed in a contemporary setting, over sixty years later.Double Indemnity proves unlike any other films of its time, as the film's tension is extracted not from the question of whether or not the lurid scheme of the central characters will succeed, but instead through the sickly knowledge that they are fated not to, inviting the viewer to watch the whole sordid affair unfold, to see each piece fit disastrously into place. From the opening titles, the film positively drips with fatalism between MacMurray's grim voice-over to the sublime noir lighting, all creating a pitch perfect mood of unease and despair. The masterful technical work is matched by the perfectly honed screenplay by Wilder and Chandler, delivering an engrossing treatise on greed, lust and their abilities to ensnare and corrupt while cleverly mixing cynical introspection with snappy banter and the kind of exquisitely stylized lines filmmakers simply could not pull off now (see the dynamic, thinly veiled ""speeding ticket"" sexual innuendo exchange between Stanwyck and MacMurray).The idea of walking an audience through the planning and execution of a murder was a virtually unprecedented one, but the ingenious daring of Wilder and Chandler does not stop there. Not only does the film empathize with the murderers, Dietrichson for personal gain and Neff as much to shake up the prescribed order of things as his sordid infatuation with her, but also demonstrates how exhilarating and, crucially, entertaining the act of killing could be. Bathing the viewer in a seedy world of secret encounters, lurid sexual acts and casual violence played up as darkly fascinating as opposed to downright immoral, Wilder and Chandler choose to side with characters who ordinarily would have filled the roles of cinematic villains, with the lawful figure Keyes instead played almost as grotesque antagonist, blithely subscribing to a system revolving around asphyxiating order fated to collapse. Though evil is eventually punished, not only is it seemingly predisposed to overcome good, the film seems to silently state, but it is more interesting anyway - a pitch black, endlessly captivating moral stance which has lost not a shred of potency.The casting of lead character Walter Neff carries a similar parallel story of infamy to the film itself; a series of successful stars passing on the role, concerned about the implications of humanising an unrepentant killer. The final casting choice, perennial nice guy Fred MacMurray playing decidedly against type proved simply brilliant, as MacMurray inhabits the role like a cool leather glove, his fast talking salesman veneer carefully concealing a deadness in his eyes, a forever looming darkness barely veiled. MacMurray accomplishes the truly laudable feat of taking a downright unsavoury character yet still retaining the audiences' sympathies despite each unethical act, perfectly essaying the moral crux of the film. Of course, the simply stunning performance by Barbara Stanwyck as one of the most memorable femme fatale figures of the era proves a lurid highlight, as Stanwyck arguably steals the show with her searing, sultry yet devious intensity, far too charismatic and cunning to ever be reduced to a simple object of desire. The two powerhouse leads are well supported by character actor Edward G. Robinson giving a deliciously repellent performance as an order obsessive insurance agent increasingly suspicious of the insurance scam presented to him.Despite the hefty competition, there can be little doubt that Double Indemnity marks its place as one of the most emotionally gruelling and captivating film noirs of its time, and arguably in the history of the industry. Each flawless element of the film melds together to create a truly mesmerizing work just as grimly entertaining as it is technically laudable. For any in search of a taut, hard hitting piece of staunch film-making, few films would prove more fitting than Double Indemnity.-10/10"
peapulation,"Jan 28, 2009",8/10,"When we think of film noir, we think of a corrupt and glamorous world of gangsters, cigarettes and femme fatals. We think of shadows of venetian blinds and wide angle close ups. Double Indemnity is one of the best and most known examples of this genre. Billy Wilder is an absolute genius, his stories always unfolding at the right pace, and his way of bringing them to the screen barely ever impeccable.This is the forties cinema. A story of love and betrayal, of manipulation and big money. The story of femme fatal Barbra Stanwick luring poor insurance salesman Walter Niff to kill her husband so they can be together. Stanwick has what it takes to make her character look sexually dangerous and desirable. Niff has the ways and traits to make his character look like a stylish fool. But as far as acting is concerned, both are surpassed by the wonderful Edward G. Robinson, who is extraordinary delivering lines faster than MacMurray can say ""shut up, baby"".This sort of cinema will never age. It will always find a point of relation to today's society. And when it's directed in such a beautiful way, it's little wonder that the noir is so loved and remembered. The mise sn scene is beautiful. MacMurray's and Stanwyck's character are never really portrayed close. Even when they kiss, they are always shot at an awkward angle. When they are in the same frame, Wilder always makes sure that there's something in the way, whether it's a mother and a child in a supermarket, or a fish tank in the study room of the man whose murder is being secretly plotted. This murder plot reaches its height of tension when MacMurray lures Stanwyck's husband to sign a life insurance, as he thinks he is signing an ordinary car one. He is in fact signing his life away.As in too many noirs, though, it pitfalls into the use of voice over. That is forgiven because from the start we know that he is telling Edward G. Robinson the story, speaking into the voice recorder, confessing his crime of passion. It is a film of which we know the ending already. In fact, one of the most interesting things about the film is the way we observe the main character, and the way that we back him up sometimes, only to change our minds other times. Almost every scene is necessary to make up our minds, when really the only good guy is Robinson in the whole movie.WATCH FOR THE MOMENT - When the murder plot is put in act, from the arrival to the station, to when the car won't start..."
lastliberal,"Jun 3, 2007",10/10,"This film was nominated for seven Oscars and probably would have won them all if it had not been going up against Going My Way.Billy Wilder wrote and directed this outstanding film with Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck, and Edward G. Robinson in a role that has to be seen to be believed.Robinson to me is a gangster (Little Caesar, Key Largo, Larceny, Inc), but he is apparently more than that because he was simple incredible as a claims adjuster in this film. The lines Wilder gave him were brilliant and he delivered them without flaw.McMurray was the original Absent Minded Professor and, of course, the father on My Three Sons. he plays the insurance salesman who gets over his head with Stanwyck (The Big Valley). Here she is a hot blond and McMurray falls like a rock.This is one of Wilder's best and one not to miss."
bsmith5552,"Mar 20, 2005",10/10,"""Double Indemnity"" is considered by many to be among the best, if not the best of the ""film noire"" genre of the 1940s and 1950s. I agree. It has all of the classic elements of film noire: the helpless (or hapless) hero, the femme fatale, moody lighting, dark shadows and the story unfolding mostly at night.Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) is a successful insurance salesman who happens to drop in on his clients, the Dietrichsons to discuss renewal of an automobile insurance policy. Mr. Dietrichson (Tom Powers) is not at home however, his wife Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) is. Neff is immediately attracted to her and puts the moves on her. She questions him about the benefits of life insurance but repels his advances while continuing to give him the come on.Neff leaves but is surprised later when there's a knock on his door and there stands Phyllis. Slowly she seduces Walter and they appear to fall in love. The lovers plot to have Dietrichson sign up for a large life insurance policy and the plan to murder him. Walter being an insurance expert plans the murder in such a way that not only will Phyllis collect double indemnity for an accidental death or his boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) will not become suspicious.After the murder things start to unravel. A witness, Mr. Jackson turns up in Keyes office and Keyes suspicions are aroused. At first he believes that the death was a suicide but later learns that Dietricson's daughter Lola's (Jean Heather) boyfriend Nino (Byron Barr) may be implicated in the murder. Neff becomes nervous and finds out that..............The principals all turn in classic performances. MacMurray, cast against type, as the lustful Neff is outstanding. Stanwyck in a blond wig is the ultimate femme fatale using all of the males to her own advantage. Robinson steals every scene he is in as the persistent claims manager.Director Billy Wilder gets the best out of his cast and gives us a classic film. Told in flashback from Walter Neff's point of view we know right away that something has gone horribly wrong but Wilder keeps the audience in suspense and glued to their seats as the Neff dictates his confession to Keyes into a Dictaphone.An absolute classic of this or any other genre."
nicolechan916,"Dec 4, 2015",6/10,"Perhaps I have just watched my share of black and white movies that I can't really take them anymore. Or maybe the narrative was just that awful. Either way, I found this film pretty shallow to watch, though it was engaging at some parts, it otherwise felt like it was stalling along. (Also, my view probably reflects the generation I'm born in)I am pretty annoyed by Walter's narration. The film is narrated by him as he recounts the events of the past few weeks. I think I feel annoyed by his narration because his voice sounds so matter of fact and emotionless that it makes me not want to listen to him. MacMurray's acting too is quite static, matching well with his voice to produce a static and emotionless character. Stanwyck isn't much better, but does show that there is a little more depth to her character than is perceived. Robinson and Heather as supporting actors do their part well enough.The character of Phyllis, being the main female character in the film, can also be perceived as the film being misogynistic. First, she is introduced by objectification of her legs, and becoming the source of romantic interest to Walter. Then, she is depicted as the damsel in distress, needing to be saved from her terrible marriage. Then by the end she is seen as this chaotic, destructive woman. All of which are stereotypes of femininity, with the last seen as a punishment to women who resist the patriarchal order.The use of camera work and lighting plays a crucial part in the film, and does give the sense of Expressionism. With the dark matter at hand and dark mise-en-scene, it adds to the mood of the theme. However the editing style, to me, makes the film quite hectic and all over the place. It jumps from the present to the past without a strong coherent flow, and that is probably why I lost interest in the film. I imagined the film to be over multiple times until it eventually did end.However, the script was pretty engaging, with the conversations between Walter and Phyllis pretty entertaining. The flirtations between them are blatantly obvious and the metaphors used are a little cringe-worthy, but which made it fun to laugh at.Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
Danny-Rodriguez,"Jan 28, 2006",10/10,"I have a new favorite movie. If it's not Double Indemnity then at least it's the whole film noir genre. Double Indemnity was THE greatest story I have ever have had the pleasure of seeing. It had it all. It was black and white, it had a great theme song and it had such deep characters. Characters you really feel with. This was my first REAL film noir. I had seen Chinatown before this one but that is classified as neo noir because it's in color.Did I mention that the acting in this movie is the best acting I have ever seen in a movie? And I mean real acting. Not like real acting like you'll find in Mockumentaries where the acting is so natural only because it's improvised. No, the acting in this movie is in the scale of stage actors. The best there is. The lines are all delivered in such a natural way because they are natural. Meaning that there isn't a single line in this movie that I would even think about changing.The directing and cinematography were the best I have ever seen. The opening credits feature a man in crutches walking towards the screen in Silhouette while dramatic music plays over the soundtrack and credits appearing and disappearing on the screen. From there on the movie had me. How could I stop watching after a credit sequence like that? As the movie plays out we keep hearing the same theme. And I wouldn't have it any other way.This movie is recommended. Recommended to everyone by me. If you like any sort of cinema. And if you don't laugh at Adam Sandlers jokes then go and get this movie. Get it and never sell it. Because it is the greatest piece of cinema I have ever seen."
lisaabrams-08,"Jan 31, 2025",7/10,"Good classic film .Containing plenty of loaded dialog, shadowy settings and frequent flashes of well-timed tension, Double Indemnity's story of murder and deception comes together quite nicely like that of a master jigsaw puzzle where all of the scattered pieces of its plot-line eventually become one.Even though I view Double Indemnity as essentially a ""Chick Flick"", its story is told (chiefly in long flashbacks) by a man who was directly involved in this double-crossing crime-of-passion that went seriously haywire. Fred MacMurray plays Walter Neff, an over-confident, yet naively gullible insurance salesman, who, thinking that he's got it all figured out, gets played for an all-time sucker when the seductive, well-to-do Mrs. Dietrichson snares him into a diabolical plot to kill her husband in order to collect $100,000 through the double indemnity clause in his life insurance policy."
bmacv,"Nov 29, 2001",10/10,"Double Indemnity is the crown jewel of the entire film noir cycle, its black sapphire.  The project started with the fervid plotting and prose of James M. Cain's shocker (one of his three novels, including Mildred Pierce and The Postman Always Rings Twice, which supplied material for three key films of the 1940s).  Director Billy Wilder and the formidable Raymond Chandler (taking a well-remunerated break from his Philip Marlowe books) labored unhappily only to give birth to a hard and glittering masterpiece of a screenplay. Wilder then filmed it with breathtaking panache.  The story's brew of adultery, murder and duplicity was a slap in the face to wartime audiences, content with supping upon optimistic, sentimental cinematic fare. Barbara Stanwyck abandoned women's weepers and screwball romps to don an anklet and create Phyllis Dietrichson, the coldest and deadliest of the cycle's femmes fatales;  she delivers an unforgettable, sensational performance, never surpassed even by her later outings as Martha Ivers, Thelma Jordon and Mae Doyle D'Amato (in Clash by Night).  As intrepid insurance investigator Barton Keyes, Edward G. Robinson is at his wry and crafty best, serving to puncture the unrelievedly heavy and suffocating textures of the film.  The surprise is amiable, dull Fred MacMurray who is just perfect as the way-out-of-his-depth bachelor whose downfall is thinking with his zipper.  Double Indemnity is one film noir whose vision is not compromised by parsimonious budgets, a recycled and warmed-over script, sub-par casting or by-the-numbers direction; for once, everything works right, and the upshot is one of the greatest, if darkest, movies ever made in America."
ragosaal,"Apr 13, 2007",9/10,"I can't think of a director that got so many great movies in the different genres as Billy Wilder. In comedy he made the excellent ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""Irma la Douce""; he also made the romantic ""Sabrina""; ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""The Apartment"" and ""The Lost Week-End"" were his contributions to drama; ""Stalag 17"" is a war film; ""Witness for the Prosecution"" is a great mystery thriller; all memorable products in the history of Hollywood.With ""Double Indemnity"" he obtained what is probably the ultimate Film Noir. There's not much to add about this extraordinary movie to what I¨ve red here in other comments. Just that I never was a fan of Fred MacMurray and yet I have to admit he does a very good job in this one (perhaps his best ever along with his treacherous and false navy officer in ""The Caine Mutiny"").Billy Wilder was indeed a very talented man as a movie maker and also had an undeniable skill for recognizing a good story when it came his way. One of the great directors ever, no doubt."
LibertyValance27-1,"Feb 23, 2005",10/10,"I cannot say enough good things about this film, it is perfect as far as movies go, it stands up perfectly after more than 60 years! This was the film that convinced me that older or ""classic"" films were not only watchable, but most of the best movies ever made were made decades ago. I remember watching this film on TV for the first time, years ago, and I could not stop watching it. It made no sense to me, the film was old, black and white, and they talked funny, yet I sat there stunned by it's brilliance. Looking back on it now, it makes sense that I enjoyed it so much (and still do) the story and acting are great, the direction and dialogue, although dated is excellent. The direction of the masterful Billy Wilder truly makes this film explode with taut, sexy, and dangerous energy.Fred MacMurray is surprisingly excellent as the insurance salesman, Walter Neff. He makes a house call to one of his customers, only to find him not at home. However what he does find is the dangerous and sexy Phyllis Dietrichson, played by Barbara Stanwyck. They fall for one another and hatch a plot that involves murder and insurance fraud. However when all is not as it seems Walter wants out, he suspects he may be just another sucker that is being used by the temptress Mrs. Dietrichson. However as Walter finds out, and as his friend and enemy Barton Keyes,(Edward G. Robinson) tells him, ""committing murder is not like taking a trolley ride together where they can get off at different stops. They're stuck with each other and they've got to ride all the way to the end of the line and it's a one-way trip and the last stop is the cemetery."" Walter tries to get off of that trolley but soon realizes that Keyes warning was prophetic.There are many suspenseful twists and turns that I will not divulge here, cause I want everyone who watches this film for the first time, to enjoy it as I did. However I will say that this is an excellent film, the very definition of film-noir. Wilder tells an amazing story in a very suspenseful manner, and the script and acting are very intelligent. This film crackles along with suspense, intrigue and romance. And it is a perfect time capsule of the period in which film-noir was born and achieved it's great success. Overall very entertaining and highly recommended!"
perfectbond,"Nov 7, 2003",9/10,"I'm not sure I can think of any new original praise for this film. All I can say is that the suspenseful twists and turns of the the classic film-noir plot and the moral ambiguity of Walter and Phyliss brought to life by truly memorable performances by MacMurray and Stanwyck (and Robinson in his key supporting role as Keys) left an indelible mark on my cinema mad mind even before I had become aware of the film's deserved legendary reputation. When I think of this film, I think of Proverbs 5:3-5 For the lips of a strange woman drop as an honeycomb, and her mouth is smoother than oil. But her end is bitter as wormwood, sharp as a two-edged sword. Her feet go down to death; her steps take hold on hell."
H4wke,"Apr 19, 2025",7/10,"Is it fair to judge a film that influenced the things that made it feel less fresh? Probably not, but I'm doing it anyway and you can't stop me.As far as film noirs go, this one hits every beat so well that I'm constantly reminded of the genre it's in. It took me out of it a little bit.I don't know if this is blasphemy to say, but I actually prefer its loose remake 'Body Heat'. That film had a verisimilitude that this one lacks, with its constant reminders of a stifling temperature and the characters reaching boiling point as a result. In 'Double Indemnity', the film has its own atmosphere, its style just highlights how hollow the characters are. Perhaps that's the point, I just didn't connect with it all that much.Still, it should be appreciated, especially for when it came out. I'm glad I watched it, and a rewatch might let me see its strengths a little more clearly."
DrewAlexanderR1,"Aug 21, 2015",10/10,"Double Indemnity is a movie that is like the periodic table to science. This movie is absolutely essential to the medium of film. It is one of those flicks that will always stand the test of time. It's a film to study as well as one to love and enjoy. It is a muse for a lot of films that have been made since this 1944 masterpiece.The story is about an insurance representative, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), who falls in love with a woman, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). She wants him to help her murder her husband and the bonus behind this plan is that the death of Mr. Dietrichson will trigger a heavy life insurance payout. The crime is carefully inspected by Neff's boss, insurance investigator, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).This film was nominated for seven Oscars for a reason. The acting is superb and is to a standard that modern audiences will appreciate. The directing of Billy Wilder (Some Like It Hot, Sunset Blvd.) makes it film noir classic. And the screenplay is one of the best that Hollywood has produced.Double Indemnity is a film that everyone should watch. It should be something that should be passed down from generation to generation. It is a perfect film in so many ways and one that should be held in the highest regard by all who watch it. This film defines 10 out of 10."
Horror-yo,"Jan 31, 2018",6/10,"Billy Wilder rhymes with quality film-noir by reputation. Snappy quick-witted dialog, a tumultuous introduction that forces the viewer right into the thick of the plot and action that often starts at the very end before recounting the story (as here), a femme fatale lead character along with a cynical blasé male lead who often switches between effective line delivery and narration in the background (as here), and a plot that is complex involving different parties that appreciates a psychological intrigue and insight into the protagonists' minds and motivations, the actors always top drawer with their individual performance and presence onscreen offering strong guarantee for the whole ride.The thing about this one is as often the dialog is too dense and too prolific imposing a solicitation of utter focus and attention from the viewer for the entire show and where it's interesting and effective in many parts, it's just too much effort for little reward: the actors just spew out a ton of lines with incredible cadence and this contributes to a feeling of prolonged length. Also strongly adding to the effect of distorted time, like the film is too long for its own good is how it runs out of puff at just about 30 minutes before the end. All of the wit and plot strong points and crux of the film are dispensed through the first hour plus, and just when the momentum appears to be at a peak the film aggressively maintains a suspended effort of keeping that high note going on, and on, where it feels artificially kept alive and can't seem to make itself as interesting as the first two thirds. There's a natural rhythm and momentum for any film but these crime film-noirs especially and the intrigue needs to be carefully conducted and evenly spread over whichever period of time. It just feels dead and drags on at the end here, the last half hour rather painful and with little reward as there's a strong feeling of inevitability that something fairly predictable and just about how we'd imagine it is about to happen, the film strips its own self of any element of surprise and spontaneity and denies its viewer a punchy ending which is disappointing after demanding such focus from the audience.Finally, there's also the fact this sort of film relies on details fulfilling the requirements of the plot and there's a dominant feeling of predictability and convenience to key characters with their resolving of the plot. This remains a top film-noir for what it is and lots of good work was also put into it, however there's no excuse for throwing off the pace and having a film end on a lackluster note, if you're the film-maker it's your number one duty.6.5/10."

tfrizzell,"Nov 3, 2003",N/A,"Woody Allen once called ""Double Indemnity"" the finest American movie ever made. That may be going out on a limb a bit, but then again Allen is more than a film-maker. He is a historian, a listener, a writer and a supreme judge of movies. While I am not going to agree that this is the finest movie ever produced in the U.S., I am still going to say that this is easily one of the very best films ever conceived and executed through the history of motion pictures. An insurance man (Fred MacMurray) goes to renew an automobile policy for the ridiculously wealthy Tom Powers. Instead of finding his man though he meets Powers' super-wicked and highly sexual wife (Barbara Stanwyck, in an unforgettable Oscar-nominated part). They flirt immediately. There is something more than friendship there and a crazed affair starts. Stanwyck, a master manipulator tells sob stories to MacMurray about her abusive husband (embellishing quite a bit in the process). MacMurray, only having eyes for Stanwyck, comes up with a plan with her to have Powers killed so they can collect the insurance via the titled policy. Naturally though Stanwyck does not think near as much of the relationship as MacMurray does and the duo must constantly dodge pesky insurance investigator Edward G. Robinson (in one of his finer roles) and Stanwyck's suspicious step-daughter (Jean Heather). All told through intense flashbacks by MacMurray, ""Double Indemnity"" is quite possibly co-writer/director (Oscar-nominated in both categories) Billy Wilder's finest contribution to the cinema. As time passes, many film scholars confuse this as one of Alfred Hitchcock's productions. Looking back, this is a very odd movie for Wilder (considering latter triumphs with movies like ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Stalag 17"", ""Some Like It Hot"" and ""The Apartment""). However Wilder would continue a similar trend immediately following this in 1945 with the Best Picture Oscar-winning ""The Lost Weekend"", an intense character-study of one man's (Ray Milland) bout with alcoholism. ""Double Indemnity"" has nothing wrong with it. I cannot think of one negative throughout the film. I never found Stanwyck very attractive, but she has a way about her that makes her deceptively sexy here. MacMurray, one of those actors who never got any credit, does probably his best work ever in this one and Robinson is his usual dominant, scene-stealing self. Wickedly brilliant, fun to watch, dramatic, darkly comical, superbly written and flawlessly directed, ""Double Indemnity"" is one of those movies that should be embraced by all fans of the national and international cinema. 5 stars out of 5."
talisencrw,"Sep 22, 2016",10/10,"It's definitely hard to pin down a personal favourite Wilder film, though I tend towards his earlier masterworks such as 'The Lost Weekend', 'Sunset Boulevard'...and THIS. He was one of the finest at getting straight through the bullshit and to the heart of all things noir (as the immortal Jean-Luc Godard stated, 'All I need to make a film is a man, a girl and a gun').Barbara Stanwyck is one of my favourite actresses of the period, and is a classic 'femme fatale'. I've never been a huge fan of Fred MacMurray, but his 'nice guy' persona is used to sheer advantage by Wilder, and he end up both doing his finest work for Wilder (here and in 'The Apartment') and being the ultimate noir male protagonist. Interestingly, one of my favourite actors, Edward G. Robinson, thought so much of the script that he opted out of his demand of never doing a supporting role. Many people admire Wilder the director, but as a writer (or co-writer) he's just as cinematically important and influential.Like any other film of his, at least that I've had the pleasure to see, it's worth a purchase and re-watches. The dialogue, especially, is simply fantastic. I'd take just one of his early works over a hundred of the films Hollywood churns out nowadays. They're simply that better and intrinsically satisfying. Immortal cinema."
renegadeviking-271-528568,"Mar 8, 2022",8/10,"Directed by Billy Wilder in 1944, Double Indemnity is the quintessential film noir. Based on the novel by James M Cain, the film follows insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) who finds himself seduced by the wife of one of his wealthier clients; the beautiful, but cunning Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbra Stanwyck). Phyllis is the classic femme fatale; she perpetuates an innocent facade, but beneath this she is a master manipulator, and she convinces Walter to assist her in murdering her husband. The pair conspire to portray Mr Dietrichson's death as an accident in order to receive a hefty insurance payout, which will be doubled if Dietrichson dies in what is considered to be a rare or unusual way, such as by a collision with a train. Walter's insurance experience enables him to plot the murder seamlessly, but his boss, Barton Keyes (Edward G Robinson), has a knack for sniffing out bogus claims, and it is not long before he starts to have suspicions about the death of Mr Dietrichson.Double Indemnity is a visually stunning film that uses all of the stylistic choices associated with film noir; the high contrast black and white, the oblique camera angles, and the shadowy light filtering through the horizontal blinds. As soon as the film opened with the image of a man's silhouette hobbling through the mist on crotches, I was hooked. I personally adore this style, and the time period in which these films are set; where the men wear hats and trench coats, and the women look sleek and elegant in gowns that reveal only a little bit of flesh. These films are glamorous and sophisticated, and conjure up a sense of nostalgia; a longing for a time that most of us alive today have never experienced.Barbra Stanwyck is killer in this film. She may not be a traditional beauty, but she smolders on the screen. She has such a powerful presence that she conveys with utmost subtlety, and as a viewer you are drawn to her in every scene. Fred MacMurray delivers an adequate performance; he is convincing and satisfying as Walter Neff, but he is never outstanding. Edward G Robinson, on the other hand, is charming and amusing as Walter's eccentric, slightly caricatured boss.The film is extremely dialogue reliant, but this never becomes tiresome as the exchanges between the characters are so witty, and are often layered with sexual innuendo, particularly between Walter and Phyllis. Additionally, the pace of the film is quite slow, which again leads to an assumption that the film would consequently drag, however, this pace works perfectly in creating suspense. Billy Wilder emulates Hitchcock in many suspenseful scenes throughout Double Indemnity, most notably in the climatic showdown between Phyllis and Walter, and also the scene at the train tracks.Miklós Rózsa's original score is probably my least favourite part of the film as it is quite jarring and often draws attention to itself, rather than simply supporting the visuals. Personally, I don't believe that the score suits the rest of the film in terms of style, however, it does assist in supporting suspense.The term ""film noir"" wasn't coined until two years after Double Indemnity was released. French film critic Nino Frank is credited with the term, but at the time the American film industry did not accept ""film noir"" as an official genre. Whether it is a genre, a style or a movement is still debated today. Frank was able to recognise this trend in American films due to the fact that the second World War caused a delay in the release of these films in France, and they all hit French screens at around the same time. Frank noticed that most of these films involved the solving a crime, employed a melancholy voice over, and tended to have a pessimistic vibe.Double Indemnity was certainly not the first film noir to be made; many films dating more than a decade prior have been later classified as film noir, however, the success of Double Indemnity among critics and audiences alike at the time of its release has caused it to receive the greatest recognition as the most identifiable film noir."
faraaj-1,"Jun 9, 2006",10/10,"Insurance companies pay a double indemnity on certain unique kinds of accidental death. Its a marketing tactic. So, for example, if your husband is insured for $50,000 accidental death and he dies on or falling off a train (the probability of which is extremely low), the payout is double i.e. $100,000.Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, is the lead role in this director Billy Wilder's finest film. The femme fatale is Mrs. Phyllis Dietrichson and the insurance investigator is the wily Barton Keyes. The three central roles are played by Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. The film has a great visual style (starting from the opening credits of a man on crutches to the intelligent usage of the dictaphone as a narrative device) and Robinson constantly needing a light with dialogue (written by a reportedly drunk Raymond Chandler) as good as that Out of the Past or Maltese Falcon. The score is a classic.I thought MacMurray was fine in this role but I do wonder what a Bogart or Robert Mitchum or even a lesser Kirk Douglas or Edmund O'Brien would have done with.Apparently Wilder thought that the wig Stanwyck wore was a mistake but he was already one month into shooting and it was too late. She does seem kind of silly in it! Robinson is great as usual as the investigator.Noir fans may also want to check out The Killers with Edmund O'Brien as a persistent insurance investigator investigating the death of Burt ""the Swede"" Lancaster."

Falkner1976,"Jan 13, 2023",10/10,"Based on ""the other"" novel by James M Cain, Double Indemnity is one of the quintessential classics of film noir, made precisely in the year of great classics of film noir: Laura, Woman in the window, Double indemnity, three great film noir as different as they are complementary.To adapt and film this story, Wilder had the best of the best. As always, he signed a script in collaboration, but not with his usual partner Charles Brackett, but with Raymond Chandler; he had the highest paid actress and the highest paid actor of the moment, and with one of the greatest supporting actors (earning as much as the main ones). He had cinematography by John F. Setz (with whom he would collaborate on his best films for Paramount); and music by the highly renowned composer Miklós Rózsa (who would work for Hitchcock on Spellbound the following year).Double Indemnity, of the three great classics of 1944 film noir, as is logical due to its origin, is the closest to the type of crime novel. It does not have the dreamlike and threatening atmosphere of Woman in the window, nor the elegant and obsessive emotional plot of Laura, but it is the one that most directly integrates the disenchanted world of corruption, which will be so characteristic of the genre, on a day-to-day basis of American society.Double indemnity also shows the fascinating and sinister side of vulgarity, embodied in Barbara Stanwyck's shocking blonde wig (as opposed to Joan Bennet's glamorous femme fatale in Woman in the Window). It is that blonde wig, like the ankle bracelet, the great characterization trait of an attractive character in its striking vulgarity, above having to accommodate to established behaviors or aesthetics. Next to him, the stereotypical beauty of Jean Heather, whose paleness does not live up to the name of Lola Dietrichson, is completely nondescript.Regarding the novel, the film incorporates a curious flashback structure and an initial use of voiceover highly praised by the writer James M. Cain, which from the beginning introduces a character of tragic inexorability into the plot. Here the narrator is a dying man, a few years later Wilder will be even more ironic and extreme and he will be a corpse (Sunset boulevard). But more importantly, here our anchorage with the story, through whom we see it, with whom we identify is a criminal, and a criminal without palliatives and without extenuating conditions.The story is a revision of The Postman always rings twice, but much seedier and dirtier. Here the murderers lack the romantic appeal of the film with Lana Turner and John Garfield (another great classic that would be made only 2 years later). We have Walter Neff, an insurance salesman, who one day meets Phyllis Dietrichson, the extravagantly beautiful and dissatisfied wife of a wealthy industrialist, in one of those mansions in a wealthy city of Los Angeles. There is an immediate recognition of each other's abilities, criminal abilities as well as amatory ones. Walter seems like he's been waiting his whole life to meet not only the girl, but also the opportunity to really put his theorical experience in crime and embezzlement to good use. The woman convinces Walter of her husband's cruelty, of the impossibility of living like this, but it is clear that she is convincing him because Fred wants to be convinced. Walter deep down cares little about murdering the husband, he wants the combination of girl and money that comes his way. Phyllis is presented with the chance to manipulate a man who doesn't even have to be manipulated into committing the murder she wants.Here, unlike The Postman Always Rings Twice, the love relationship between Walter and Phyllis repels and terrifies us, because both are nothing more than two cold and calculating murderers (who more, who less). But even so, we are on their side; inevitably suspense is built because we don't want them to be found out. Thus the tension of that wonderful scene of Edward G. Robinson (as the investigator for the insurance company, the only really positive role in the film) and Fred MacMurray talking in the corridor of his home, while Robinson waits for the elevator, and Barbara Stanwyck who has come to visit Fred believing him alone, hiding behind the wide open door (the door that opens in the opposite direction), is generated because we are obviously afraid that Robinson will discover the relationship between them.It is a cinema from a time when, despite the Hays Code, ambiguity counted, where the viewer could face the ethical dilemma of identifying with definitely non-positive characters, and who have not been softened (no crimes of passion, or alienations momentary or permanent etc...), and reject them at the same time. All that was required is that each culprit at the end of the film receive their punishment.The film features three unforgettable performances: MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Few actresses are as intelligent, honest and versatile as Barbara Stanwyck, here in one of her greatest roles. At all times she shows how the character dominates the situation, even sitting in the corner of a sofa where she does not occupy even half of it. The same can be said of Robinson, the quintessential gangster was at the same time one of the actors with the greatest ability to impregnate his characters with humanity, and conveys all the intelligence, enthusiasm, and ultimately the disappointment of the character. MacMurray, for his part, showed great courage in facing a role that required abandoning the ground he dominated, that of representing the honest and healthy average American. He was the perfect choice for the role and Wilder knew it.The film is full of unforgettable scenes in addition to the one already mentioned: the first conversation between MacMurray and Standwyck, the meetings at the supermarket (plotting the murder between jars of baby food), the final duel...Wilder would say that it was his best film, for a reason."
hall895,"Mar 24, 2009",7/10,"We begin at the end. Double Indemnity is a film which tells you its ending right at the start. And then the flashback begins and we spend the rest of the film seeing how it is we got to that ending we already know. It would seem that under these circumstances there may not be much drama or tension in the film but that could not be further from the truth. We may know the film's ultimate destination but the journey never fails to be compelling. It is fascinating to watch this classic film noir story unfold. It is a film which will hold your attention throughout.Fred MacMurray has the lead role in the film, that of insurance salesman Walter Neff, an ordinary man who will find himself entangled in an extraordinarily complex murder plot. The drama begins when Walter meets Phyllis Dietrichson, a woman quite eager to see her husband meet an untimely demise. A demise which will prove to be quite lucrative for Phyllis if only she can manage to take out a life insurance policy on her husband without his knowledge. Here of course is where our insurance salesman enters the picture and the plot will very quickly be put into motion.Barbara Stanwyck plays Phyllis in what would come to be one of film's most famous femme fatale roles. While Walter initially is not at all interested in murder he certainly is interested in Phyllis and it does not take long for her to entangle Walter in her web. The fact it takes her so little time to convince a man she doesn't even know to murder her husband does strain credulity a bit. One moment Walter meets Phyllis and seemingly a moment later he's willing to kill for her. It is very obvious who the stronger of the two characters is. Phyllis is cold and ruthless and apparently has her ways of convincing a weaker man to do her bidding. Since this is a film produced in 1944 we're not going to see explicitly what those ways may be but you can hazard a good guess. Walter never stood a chance.The story always captivates and it is fascinating to see the seemingly perfect murder plot play out. But the movie does have some flaws. Much of the dialogue seems clipped and forced. MacMurray is the biggest offender in this regard, so often speaking in a tone which seems completely unnatural. His insistence on referring to Phyllis as ""Baby"" every time he speaks to her wears thin quickly. It's as if Walter is trying real hard to be the cold, hard tough guy but it never convinces. He's no match for Phyllis. In fact while MacMurray is obviously playing the key figure it is Edward G. Robinson in a supporting role as insurance company investigator Barton Keyes who really shines. Watching Keyes try to unravel the plot, the plot we already know inside and out, is great fun and Robinson does an excellent job with his role, creating a truly memorable character. And of course Stanwyck is excellent as well. MacMurray's OK, just not up to the level of his co-stars, which is exacerbated by the fact that it is he who narrates the story throughout the film-long flashback.All in all, director Billy Wilder did a magnificent job creating a wonderfully atmospheric thriller. The look and feel of the film are perfect, adding to the great tension. The fact there is so much tension and drama even though we pretty much already know what's going to happen is remarkable. Yes at times the film seems a little dated, most especially with its dialogue. But there is no denying the film is very well done. It's not a perfect film by any means but it is one which rightly will stand the test of time."
mdechene,"Feb 18, 2008",5/10,"I saw this movie about 6 years after it was released. Never saw it again until February of 2008. I expect a lot from movies and I am quick to criticize. I thoroughly enjoyed this ""old"" classic! Fred Mcmurray & Edward G. Robinson both played very different roles for this era. They were superb! If you've never seen the movie, it is worth a viewing. If it's been awhile since you've seen it, see it again. For me, it was as though I had never seen it. I knew the stars and I knew the plot, but that's about all I remembered. I would really like to see what the movie would be like if it were remade 2008 style! This is a black and white movie. No color is really needed. The stars make it all happen."
NoArrow,"Aug 5, 2004",N/A,"A regular reviewer would get into the heavy details of the plot of Billy Wilder's `Double Indemnity', but I wont, because I feel that a film like this should be viewed by someone who knows practically nothing of the plot, so every scene can be a surprise.  What I will say about the plot, just so you have an idea if you don't already know, is that insurance salesman Neff (Fred MacMurray) and his client Phyllis (Barbara Stanwyck) have a criminal plot to carry out, and claims man Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) is onto them.The movie is a Film-Noir, a terrific B&W genre that died out, I guess, in the early sixties.  Sure, Noirs are still being made today, but those ones are more of a homage to the classic Film-Noirs of the thirties, forties and fifties.  `Double Indemnity' was released in 1944, when Film-Noir was at its prime, with releases like `The Maltese Falcon' right behind it and `The Third Man' just ahead.  To me, `Double Indemnity' is the greatest.It's hard to differentiate Noirs from the regular crime or mystery movies of the past, but I think Roger Ebert said it best in his review for `Out of the Past': `The noir hero is doomed before the story begins -- by fate, rotten luck, or his own flawed character. Crime movies sometimes show good men who go bad. The noir hero is never good, just kidding himself, living in ignorance of his dark side until events demonstrate it to him.'  That character in `Double Indemnity' is Neff, a man who thinks he's carrying out Phyllis' plan because of his love for the woman, but indeed is not.  He likes the plan, he likes doing it, just for the sake of carrying out the evil deed.Phyllis shares his love for the dark, and the evil scheme is the basis of their relationship.  They are never seen talking about anything but the plan, they don't want to, instead of being in love with each other they're in evil with each other.And then there's Keyes, a man who's life has been consumed by his profession so much so that he once dumped his fiancée because he found out about some sketchy business from her past, he says.  But he is a great man, strong willed and smarter than any other man working at his firm, including his boss.  When his boss asks the wrong question he flares into a huge speech about why the question is ludicrous, and why the boss is unfit for his profession.  Sure, he's rambling, but he has the right to, he's the cleverest claims man you'll ever find.So the better part of the movie is about Neff avoiding and out-maneuvering Keyes, a situation which generates such heated suspense, on account of both the actors and Billy Wilder's expert direction and script (co-written by Raymond Chandler).  MacMurray is perfect as the everyman with a dark side, using his     pan expression and voice as an advantage.  Some say Bogart would've been more suited with the role, but Neff is the kind of character that would look and sound tired all the time, just like MacMurray.  Stanwyck shows delicious darkness in an Oscar-nominated role, there's a scene where her face gradually turns from tearful regret to     y evil that sent chills down my spine.And, of course, there is Edward G. Robinson, in a stellar performance, stealing every scene he is in from under Mac Murray (or whomever's) feet. The role is played with such skill and focus that personally I think it's a travesty he wasn't nominated for an Oscar for it.`Double Indemnity' is the best Film-Noir, a template for perfection, 9/10."
TheUnknown837-1,"Nov 7, 2012",10/10,"There are many ideas out there on what constitutes a great film. Many would say a great film—in other words, art—is not necessarily an entertainment piece, but a movie which makes comments about life and pushes the audience to do some thinking even when the screening has ended. Personally, I've never stood with the idea that all great films are merely absorbing and never entertaining. That silly idea that films are intellectual stimulants and movies are just trash pumped up in a way that comes across as giddy. Although I do agree that many great films probe the audience to think, one of my solutions is this: when I finish the screening, I sit there afterward and tell myself that there was nothing else I would have rather done in those two hours. That sensation swelled me when I finished watching ""Double Indemnity"" for the first time about a year ago, and it has returned with me every time I have seen it since.This marvelous film-noir, directed by Billy Wilder, shoves a dagger into the idea that art cannot be entertaining, only observable. Now ""Double Indemnity"" does not make its central plot—a salesman co-opting with an unhappy housewife to murder her husband for a $100,000 insurance clause—into something exciting—something people might want to try out at home. In fact, as the movie progresses toward its third act and the two murderers start to lose their grip on what's happening, it poignantly resolves the seemingly tired idea that crime doesn't pay. But there is a certain level of joy to be had from this film. Most of it comes from the brilliant performance of Edward G. Robinson as a comically brilliant claims manager on to the big scheme, and the rest of it comes from the way director Billy Wilder brings tremendous energy out of a leisurely paced story.As much as I've enjoyed his lighthearted performances, I had always felt that Fred MacMurray was capable of putting darker edges on himself. ""Double Indemnity"" does not give him the coldblooded meanness I always felt he could play effectively, but it brings him somewhat close to that level. A man who is more clever and intelligent than he appears (not just a dumb salesman, although he does allow femme fatale Barbara Stanwyck to manipulate him), not afraid to undergo any task he puts before himself. But what is also brilliant about MacMurray's performance is the way he gets us the care. That is tricky. The character is a murderer; he planned it out; he arranged it. The movie does not condone his crime, even though his victim is hardly the world's nicest guy. And yet the audience follows MacMurray's story with a certain affection for him, and by the end, much to our shock, we actually sort of wish that he might be allowed to dodge the authorities. Or at least escape the gas chamber. The screenplay by Billy Wilder and novelist Raymond Chandler provides the motivation, the dialogue, and the drama, but MacMurray rounds it off with an easygoing, effortless shine of a performance. I do not know of Fred MacMurray was the sort of actor who took methods and concentration to a deep level, but he was one of those talents who made good acting look easy.I give MacMurray special attention, for I feel even the film's greatest admirers have more or less taken his work for granted. I do not by any mean wish to demean Barbara Stanywck's performance. She, too, is excellent. I'll go even further and say this is one of the best villains ever put on-screen. At one point, she looks up at MacMurray, we see the white in her eyes as she smiles, and shivers always run down my spine. I do not begrudge her, it is just that everybody mentions her character first of all when discussing the acting of ""Double Indemnity."" The movie's got three great performances, and the third goes to Edward G. Robinson, once again, as that eccentric claims manager. Robinson provides most of the movie's bits of comic relief, such as when he stands up to his own boss during a claims dispute, sides with the victim, and goes on a rant about ""six volumes of suicide"" and ""suicide by poisons, subdivided by types of poison"" and so forth. Robinson is the straight-shooter of the story, and his dynamic with the MacMurray character is a very fascinating sort of friendship. MacMurray even says ""I love you, too."" Today, we might take that as some sort of homoerotic subtext. Ignoring the fact that that was utterly forbidden in 1944 films, ""Double Indemnity"" plays it as a strong friendship. So as the movie progresses, the audience again starts to feel empathy, this time for how Robinson might react when he finds out his best salesman is a murderer.""Double Indemnity"" has all the makings of a great film. The photography is rich and wonderful (the Venetian blinds are used at their ultimate here), and Miklos Rozsa's string-dominate music score is more than something that just plays in the background like an out-of-tune jukebox. The film has a snappy motif theme that repeats at just the right moments and never wears out its welcome. And Billy Wilder, the director, always finds the right decisions on how to shoot a scene and when. When to keep his camera locked for a long stretch of time and when to cut away. The screenplay sure paces itself well, but Wilder was the one who had to figure out how to keep things interesting. And he did with flying colors.Here is another test for a great film. Watching a movie that you know is great with friends or relatives, and not only relishing in the fact that you love the movie, but when you can tell your associates are loving it too."
Philipp_Flersheim,"Mar 4, 2022",9/10,"'Double Indemnity' is by a good margin the most impressive film-noir I have so far watched. The plot is excellent and logical from start to finish: An insurance agent (Fred MacMurray in one of his best roles) teams up with a femme fatal (played by Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband and cash in on the insurance premium. The plan looks flawless but of course there is one snag that the two have overlooked and that the agent's older colleague (Edward G. Robinson) notices - with fatal results. All the characters are multi-layered and interesting. MacMurray plays the hard-boiled man of action who thinks of everything, but is in fact a smarmy weakling; Barbara Stanwyck initially seems to be no more than an unloved wife - as lonesome as she is lovely - but over time turns out to be as cold-blooded as she is ruthless. Robinson is a kind of father figure for McMurray. It is evident that McMurray admires his acumen as an insurance man with a nose for attempts to commit fraud, and it seems likely he develops the murder plan with the idea in the back of his mind to impress his older colleague. The acting is excellent and the dialogue unsurpassed. From today, this is one of my favourite films."
lasttimeisaw,"Oct 13, 2012",8/10,"Billy Wilder's earlier vintage work, DOUBLE INDEMNITY is an unapologetically thrilling film- noir, without any fluffy fillers, this morally shocking murder tale has justified itself as a textbook exemplar of how cinema is able to be a heavyweight platform to narrate a story, apart from all those auxiliary foils (both visually and sonically), the marrow here is a neat but impeccable script (by Wilder and Raymond Chandler).The impending tragedy has been explicitly unraveled since the very beginning, the storyline starts as a flash-back, our protagonist, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), suffering from a bullet wound in his shoulder, has stated that he neither got the money nor the woman after executed a ruthless murder, then the film jumps to the overture to delve into the details of Walter's fated encounter with Phyllis Dietrichson (a gracefully confident Barbara Stanwyck to portray a standard femme-fatale character), as an insurance rep, Walter is smitten with her and assists her to murder her wealthy husband so as to get the so-called ""double indemnity"" insurance compensation. The murder scheme certainly is not the most difficult part, the real challenge is after the evil conduct, in one hand, Walter's super-acute superior Keyes (a bona- fide scene-stealer Edward G. Robinson) who gradually detects the real motive after the presuming accident death; on the other hand, the more devilish past of Phyllis suggests that there is an even bigger conspiracy is under the way.One could never argue that the script is prodigiously witty and most notably is Keyes' eloquence in harnessing his professional intuition (""the little man inside"") to find out the loophole behind any ostensibly qualified insurance cases. It's quite unimaginable that Robinson had been snubbed for a supporting acting nomination while the film has acquired 7, including BEST PICTURE, DIRECTOR and LEADING ACTRESS (without win though); while MacMurray, had been eluded by the Academy throughout his wholesome career, potentially had delivered his best work in depicting an ambiguous figure with all he had; Stanwyck's role is a tad feeble due to her not-too-copious presence but she is just marvelous to watch with each gesture and expression entangled with her own breed of complexity, but the final convolution of her heartlessness-turns-soft tactic is a self-conscious compromise, woman falls prey of a man's world is just an illusionary chimera, which has been haunting us until this moment and will thrive on and on."
vithiet,"Apr 1, 2024",7/10,"Compared to some other acclaimed classics that didn't really do it for me, Double Indemnity is everything I was expecting from a classic film noir. It has all the tropes and stereotypes of the genre in the best of ways; it's truly enjoyable when you consider it is one of the movies, if not THE movie that started all of it! Watching it today, it's not hard to guess a lot of what will happen, but it still managed to surprise me here and there, which is a testament to its standing the test of time. And some of the elements that do make it a product of its time are now strangely endearing. All in all, recommended to the new generation!"
PWNYCNY,"Jan 25, 2008",10/10,"The movie was made in Hollywood which means that the movie should have plenty of things wrong with it. Since the movie was made by Hollywood, one could reasonably expect the movie to be intellectually shallow, poorly acted, contain an insipid love story, and be altogether entirely forgettable. In other words, another potboiler. But as much as I wanted to, I couldn't find anything wrong with this movie! This movie is terrific! Fred MacMurray (the gentleman from My Three Sons) plays one of the great heels in Hollywood motion picture history. Barbara Stanwyck ( who was from Brooklyn, New York) is at her sinister best. But the real star is Edward G. Robinson. His performance as the the insurance actuary Walter Neff is incredible. How many movies are there that portrays an office bureaucrat as a hero? That is what makes this movie so unique. This movie is a tribute to all the office workers of the world who push the papers, compile the facts, analyze the information and keep things going. Maybe if NASA had listened to their Walter Neffs, the 1986 Challenger disaster would have been averted. Who knows? But after watching this movie, one thing is certain: respect your office workers because someday they may save your life ... and your business."
Prismark10,"Sep 24, 2016",7/10,"One of the earliest example of Film Noir. The third film in Hollywood by Billy Wilder that he co-wrote with Raymond Chandler who brought the hard boiled dialogue to this thriller. This film made Wilder's name.Fred MacMurray is the insurance salesman who falls for the femme fatale with the anklet, Barbara Stanwyck. Fatally wounded he tells his tale in flashback, confessing to a Dictaphone so the company's investigator, Edward G Robinson will know that the guy across the desk was the murderer.Stanwyck was the nurse who might have bumped off the first wife and then married widower, an oil tycoon. Now bored or just wants to be on her own with the wealth, she wants to get rid off the husband. MacMurray is smitten enough to help her do the deed. The proceeds of the accidental death insurance policy she has just taken out is I guess just a bonus. Once the husband is dead he realises that he is a dead man walking.This is a cleverly constructed thriller. It really is a relationship between MacMurray, Robinson and Stanwyck. At the end it is Robinson he lets down.MacMurray is the every-man, the insurance salesman good at his job but bored and wants to runaway with a hot woman. Stanwyck is the cold, icy one. You know she is using MacMurray, he is just a sap to her. The film belongs to Edward G Robinson, the bloodhound who knows all the tricks in the books and he has volumes of them on his shelving."
adamjohns-42575,"Jun 26, 2021",5/10,"Now, you would expect an insurance salesman to be a fast talker, but it's actually difficult to keep up with the whole cast in this one. It's as if they were paid for words per minute.Once you get passed that, it's not a bad film, although the soundtrack is awful, going up and down whenever someone speaks. It's quite distracting.It's your typical film of this ilk. We've probably all seen many more like it since it's realise. A ""How to get away with murder"" plot, but there are twists and turns and I'd say that this was probably one of the first to try it in this way.The performances are all very good for the time. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson standing out the most.It's not going to fall on top of my list of films, because it just doesn't suit my tastes that much, but it is a good film."
LynneK100,"Apr 27, 2022",10/10,"This film is the gold standard for film noir. It all begins with the screenplay, a difficult but fruitful collaboration between Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler. Director Wilder knew what he was doing when he selected his cast. A key role (no pun intended) was the insurance investigator, Barton Keyes. Wilder convinced screen legend Edward G. Robinson to take a supporting role. This was Oscar's first big mistake. Not only did Robinson not win an Academy Award, he was not even nominated. (They gave it to Barry Fitgerald playing himself in ""Going My Way"" -- one of the worst calls in Oscar history.) Fred McMurray, who gave one of his two greatest performances as Walter Neff ( the other was for his role as a womanizing heel in another Billy Wilder masterpiece, ""The Apartment"") was also completely overlooked. He also had to be convinced to take a role against type. Barbara Stanwyck as the ultimate femme fatale, was at least nominated but passed over for the forth and final time. Wilder talked Stanwyck into the role of this most unsavory woman by saying, ""Are you an actress or a mouse?""Music, sets, and B&W cinematography were sheer perfection. The L. A. locations chosen for various scenes add to the credibility of the piece.All the elements came together in the film. The proper recognition was not forthcoming. Fortunately, TCM, IMBD, and Film Preservation have recognized Double Indemnity. The DVD with multiple commentary tracks is well worth the price."
manendra-lodhi,"Aug 5, 2012",9/10,"Words will not define the things that I achieved by viewing this film. The fascinating part that comes into my mind before going further is the extraordinary narrative that binds you physically as well as mentally. The film follows the journey of a sales person of an insurance company who gets into a number of events which made the whole film. It is a mix of attraction, cheating and surprises.PROS:Without a fascinating story, the film would not have been this better, so most of the credit I would give to it. Then I liked the narration which was because of the actor's firm voice. The acting is superb by all the actors. The story starts with a very fast pace from the starting itself and maintained this till the end which was beautiful. The different instances in the film are shown so properly that you would not feel that it is from the forties.CONS:Found the film absolutely perfect.MESSAGE: ""You can't escape longer.""VERDICT: ""A must watch for anyone."""
JungleThunder,"Feb 5, 2009",10/10,"""I couldn't hear my own footsteps... it was the walk of a dead man."" This flick is the ultimate black comedy in my opinion. And not only in tone and story line... but it is dark night pretty much all the time and even when it isn't, there are shadows all over everything. It looks cool. It feels uneasy. Sometimes I want to laugh but I feel somehow immoral when I do. The suspense is incredible, if you can go there with it. Go there. Walter Neff narrates the tale of his own demise. What a dope, a funny, smart, and likable guy, but a dope just the same. Keys is great with all his ranting around and his little man. And Phyllis is the most conniving femme fatale I've seen.

He was willing to help save a woman he loved.Barbara Stanwyck heats up the screen in her Oscar-nominated performance, and Edward G. Robinson is perfect as Keyes, the man who always needs a match.

caspian1978,"Jul 29, 2001",6/10,"From its filming style, its lighting, to its cast, Double Indemnity has defined film noir for over 50 years. But should it? Voted by the AFI as one of the greatest 100 films ever made in the past 100 years, AFI forgot to mention Out of the Past or Touch of Evil as an equal. Maybe he was right for the part in 1944, but why on God's green earth would they cast Fred MacMurray as the male lead? Today he shall always be remembered for one word.....flubber! Still with a supporting cast of Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G Robbinson, you can't go wrong."
Doylenf,"Mar 31, 2002",N/A,"With its crisp dialogue, rain-soaked atmosphere, low-key lighting and plot machinations, this is film noir as only Billy Wilder could envision it in the '40s. Are there are any flaws? Well, for me anyway, there's the problem of Barbara Stanwyck's tacky looking blonde wig, so evident that you wonder whether she deliberately chose it because it made her look cheap. Perhaps. But for me, it's the only thing that detracts from her otherwise solid performance. Problem is the wig makes her look like the phony she turns out to be--and Fred MacMurray, an insurance man who's been around the block a few times, should have known better. If he doesn't know people, who does??Whatever the flaws are in this film, they're more than compensated for by the clever photography, the Miklos Rozsa score, the witty screenplay and the three central performances of Edw. G. Robinson, Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck--each one playing off each other brilliantly.And who says the ending isn't resolved? It certainly is--with MacMurray waiting for the ambulance and puffing on a cigarette lit by Robinson and some classic lines of dialog...like Robinson admitting that MacMurray was more than just the man who sat at a nearby desk. ""I love you too,"" is MacMurray's closing line.Fascinating film noir that would have been even better without Stanwyck's decision to use that tacky blonde wig."

A lot of credit must be given to Billy Wilder for his first rate direction. It will give you the feel of Sunset Boulevard but has its own special appeal. It is not predictable and will keep you guessing throughout. This is truly one of our greatest American movies. As a bonus, you will see several street scenes of Los Angeles in 1944. Get a load of those old stop signs. Don't miss this classic."
danvolbek,"Nov 8, 2000",10/10,"In my opinion, the all-time greatest film noir picture ever!  A basically good guy (Fred MacMurray) allows himself to be led down the path of corruption.

springfieldrental,"Feb 12, 2025",10/10,"Even though the term ""film noir"" hadn't been invented yet until the mid-1950s, director/writer Billy Wilder produced what is considered the definitive noir movie in July 1944's ""Double Indemnity."" ""I never heard that expression film noir when I made Double Indemnity,"" said Wilder years later. ""I just made pictures I would have liked to see. When I was lucky, it coincided with the taste of the audience. With Double Indemnity, I was lucky.""
Wilder knew he wanted to make a detective-type film, and loved James Cain's 1936 novella 'Double Indemnity.' He turned to detective fiction writer Raymond Chandler, whom he felt his style was closest to Cain's, to provide the hard-boiled dialogue to his script. Even though their relationship was highly volatile, the two produced one of the most influential early noirs in cinema, leading up to an Academy Awards Best Picture nomination.Wilder brought on board Chandler after his regular screenwriting partner, Charles Brackett, found Cain's book so repulsive he refused the assignment. Chandler never wrote a screenplay, and he felt Cain's novella was utter trash, but he accepted the job. The two strong personalities eventually clashed, with Chandler refusing to return to Wilder's office to work. A studio representative went to his house to see what was the matter. Chandler spit out, ""Mr. Wilder frequently interrupts our work to take phone calls from women. Mr. Wilder ordered me to open up the window. He did not say please. He sticks his baton in my eyes. I can't work with a man who wears a hat in the office."" The writer was prepared to quit if Wilder didn't apologize. Billy relented, saying, ""It was the first--and probably only--time on record in which a producer and director ate humble pie, in which the screenwriter humiliated the big shots.""
Chandler's drinking habit during working hours drove Wilder nuts. The writer's pounding down shots of hard liquor inspired the director after ""Double Indemnity's"" release to make 1945's ""The Lost Weekend,"" an Oscar Best Picture winner about an alcoholic. Chandler can be seen in the 1944 film in his only on-screen appearance when actor Fred McMurray leaves Edward G. Robinson's office. Chandler is sitting just outside the door on a chair reading a magazine.Barbara Stanwyck, Hollywood's highest paid actress and Wilder's first choice to play Phyllis Dietrichson, was like Brackett equally skeptical about the sordid plot. Wilder described the actress ""a little afraid after all these years of playing heroines to go into an out-and-out killer."" He goaded her to take the role saying, ""Well, are you a mouse or an actress."" She eventually agreed. Stanwyck's ""as good an actress as I have ever worked with,"" praised Wilder. ""Very meticulous about her work. We rehearsed the way I usually do. Hard. There were no retakes.""
Wilder looked for an actor who was nice on the outside but a cynic on the inside to play the sap insurance salesman Walter Neff, who gets entangled with Phyllis. After several actors passed, Wilder approached Fred McMurray. ""I'm a saxophone player,"" he told the director, ""I do little comedies with Carole Lombard."" Be he also agreed, warning Wilder, ""You're making the mistake of your lifetime."" In hindsight, McMurray said he ""never dreamed it would be the best picture I ever made.""
""Double Indemnity"" opens in typical noir fashion by one big flashback. A wounded Neff recounts his relationship with married Mrs. Dietrichson, talking into the company's dictaphone in his office. His initial business visit to the Dietrichson household is greeted by his client's wife alone at home. Wilder had the idea to fit Stanwyck with a blond wig to make her appear cheap but erotic. Days into filming he realized he made a mistake, but it was too late without extensive reshooting. Paramount Pictures head of production, Buddy DeSylva, fumed at the wig when viewing the dailies, saying, ""We hire Barbara Stanwyck and here we get George Washington."" Phyllis first appears walking down the stairs wearing an ankle bracelet, which back then meant a woman's available. Ned informs her about her husband's car insurance. But Phyllis quickly turns the conversation of purchasing a life insurance policy for her husband-without him knowing-with a ""double indemnity"" clause attached, which would pay much more in case of accidental death.Claims manager Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) starts looking into the death of Phyllis' husband after she makes a claim on the policy. Accustomed receiving top billing, the actor first refused to play the supporting role. But when he realized he was being paid the same as the two leading stars for doing far less scenes, he signed on the dotted line.Wilder brought on his favorite cinematographer, John Seitz, a big fan of German Expressionism's low key lighting. ""Sometimes the rushes were so dark you couldn't see anything,"" Wilder noticed. ""He went to the limits of what could be done."" To reflect the conniving couple's inner predicament as Keyes was closing in on them, Seitz lit his set in a ""venetian blind"" lighting style, illuminating subliminal prison bars throughout the interior rooms. Stanwyck praised Seitz' lighting, remarking, ""for an actress, let me tell you the way those sets were lit, the house, Walter's apartment, those dark shadows, those slices of harsh light at strange angles - all that helped my performance. The way Billy staged it and John Seitz lit it, it was all one sensational mood.""
""Whether it was the 'first true' film noir can be debated,"" wrote film historian Tim Dirks. ""The influence of this definitive film noir (with its typical conventions of ""Venetian blind"" lighting and voice-over narration) can be found in other countless imitations ever since."" Added film reviewer Glenn Erickson, ""The more we ruminate about film noir, the more 'Double Indemnity' seems to be THE picture that set the style in motion. By directly addressing adultery and premeditated murder for profit, it opened the floodgate for all manner of previously taboo subject matter.""
""Double Indemnity"" was nominated for seven Academy Awards, but took home none. Besides Best Picture, Billy Wilder was nominated for Best Director, Barbara Stanwyck for Best Actress, Wilder and Chandler for Best Screenplay, Seitz for Best Black and White Cinematography, Miklos Rozsa for Best Musical Score, and for Best Sound Recording. The American Film Institute ranks it as the 29th Best Movie Ever Made, the 24th Most Thrilling, the 84th Most Passionate, and Phyllis Dietrichson as the eighth most Villainous person in film. It's also included in a number of Best of... rankings, with Entertainment Weekly listing it as #50 all-time greatest movie as well as its inclusion in Time magazine's 100 Best Movies. The film noir is one of 'One Thousand and One Movies You Must See Before You Die.'"

Taffyta,"Mar 23, 2013",7/10,"After just having watched this film, what initially sticks out to me is all of the suspense. There were a few instances when I was just sitting here, wondering what was about to happen. What were the characters going to do now? Even by the end I'm still asking myself questions. For what I thought film noir to be, it was pretty much as I imagined. There were higher contrasted scenes and shots of characters shadows and things. Not throughout the whole thing, in day time shots, but it was still there. But it did seem like that whole stereotypical noir feeling with the narrating by the main character. I feel like parodies of film noir in todays culture base everything off a movie like this one. A cool sounding guy sitting at his desk, telling you how it all went down. That feels very ""noir"" to me."

I loved how you get the feel of what life was like back then captured so easily making us see the generation of its time and how they thought and acted. There is a scene where Walter tells Keyes to ask for matches when he buys his cigars because he is constantly lighting one for him. Keys responds, I don't like carrying them in my pocket because they go off. What many don't know is that the chemical needed to create the light was included on the tip thus striking it anywhere worked. Today, that chemical is separated from the match requiring a strike source. Who would know this unless it was explained? Other references to eating at a drugstore, catching a movie for the hell of it and living in an apartment that supplies car washes. Look for these and more as they are informative.

Vartiainen,"Dec 15, 2018",7/10,"An early Billy Wilder film where a jaded insurance salesman, Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), ends up becoming smitten with Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck), a trophy wife to an oil businessman. Together they start to plan the murder of her husband in order to collect a sizable sum from the insurance they railroad him into signing. The only real threat to their plan being Neff's immediate supervisor, claims adjuster Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson).A very shocking movie for its time. In fact various people had been trying to make this movie for years, but the early 20th century censorship would not allow two criminals as the main characters. By today's standards the movie is of course relatively tame, but even today it would be odd to see the two leads planning the coldblooded murder of an innocent man. At the very least the victim would be shown to be a total monster in order for the murderers to earn our sympathy.The film has not aged with total dignity. The romance between Walter and Phyllis starts out of nowhere, the locations don't vary much and can feel a bit stiff, the dialogues feel rehearsed, even during their most heated moments, and the plot is relatively straightforward. Then again, at least for me, that's part of the charm.And the film does have some really good things in it as well. I like the framing story and the acting is superb all across the board. I especially liked Robinson's Barton Keyes. What a character, what a performance. Robinson is most well-known for his tough gangster characters during the golden age of Hollywood and some of that has slipped in here as well.One of the very first film noir films with its characters archetypes, crime-filled plot and its heavy shadows, both literal and figurative. A great watch for all fans of the genre."

orcrush,"Aug 9, 1999",9/10,"The term 'film noir' gets tossed around quite a lot describing the dark, moody crime films of the '40s. And while Bogart is considered the king of the genre, special attention needs to be paid to Fred MacMurray's performance in Billy Wilder's classic 'Double Indemnity'. 'My Three Sons' it ain't.Revealing any part of the plot would be a crime, but if you know what the term 'double indemnity' means, it won't be too hard to figure out. What I will reveal is that the dialogue is outstanding(certainly a Wilder trait), and the two lead characters are unsympathetic misfits. MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck took huge risks and gave classic performances. Equally outstanding is Edward G. Robinson, who plays the only likeable person in the movie. Of course, Robinson is remembered for his heavy gangster roles, so this twist is even more remarkable. The only thing that brings the movie down to a 9 for me is the hokey voiceover. Wilder reused the device with better results in 'Sunset Boulevard'."
elo-equipamentos,"Sep 30, 2025",10/10,"For many film historians Double Indemnity was a kind of trail blazer as the first Noir picture that gathers all elements concerning its specific genre, according several sources it had already offered to studios in early thirties, although due the neuralgic subject of try mislead insurance company by a couple of lovers crooks, it didn't get any bold producer to embrace such sinful endeavor, worst it would not pass in production code whatsoever.Therefore on decade later the things gonna change in Hollywood and the Hays Code became a slight soften, so Billy Wilder together Raymond Chandler and novel writer James Cain gave a best treatment on the screenplay and Paramount was ready to production it, even with an unexpected trouble Edward G. Robinson wasn't enough satisfied demoted to third place in casting, seemingly it was overcame due the key-character Barton Keyes was probable the best role indeed.Meanwhile the leading casting Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck complete themselves as mad personas, in fact they didn't fell any love for each other, they are essentially bad couple due Walter Ness really looks like a cynical insurance salesman often trying proves that he is far better than is manager Barton Keyes, in other hand the cold heart Phyllys is a double crossing-schemer lady, in this deadly environment the movie unfolds brightly with the craftsman filmmaker Billy Wilder in another masterpiece.Thanks for reading.Resume:First watch: 2009 / How many: 3 / Source: DVD / Rating: 10."
christophe92300,"Oct 27, 2014",7/10,"What's striking from the beginning in Double Indemnity is the quality of the dialogs, as often happens with Wilder. Granted, this was made in the 40's so some turns of phrase seem a bit pompous or outdated, but lines fly and follow each other with a remarkable fluidity, without any downs. As for the rest, the movie comprises every characteristic of the film noir genre whether on the form or content, from lighting to the voice-over or the typical characters. The plot is implacable but some elements are not very credible, like the emerging romance for example. The Machiavellian scheme and the investigation that follows it lack suspense, tension, and the outcome turns out to be a bit disappointing because it's rather telegraphed although it perfectly concludes this noir which probably remains Wilder's most iconic."
alberto-27,"Oct 10, 1999",10/10,"What defines a classic? Maybe a succession of ""tour de force""s, like casting both Fred McMurray and Edgard G. Robinson against their usual roles of good guy and bad gangster; maybe the sizzling sexual attraction between Fred McMurray and Barbara Stanwyck; there is more hot stuff in one look of Barbara than in so many explicit scenes of today's movies.To my taste, is mostly a superbly told story. We know the end from the beginning, but we are still trapped in this classic tale of sex, greed and friendship. What else can you ask for?"
chand-suhas,"Sep 20, 2025",8/10,"Insurance salesman Walter Neff is smitten by the beauty of Phyllis Deitrichson as he visits her house to make a sale with her husband. Seduced by her, Walter Neff agrees to help her out in taking her husband out of the equation for the insurance claim with the added clause of double indemnity. He plans a perfect crime with her or so he thinks. Even the most cleverly executed plan can fall apart and that is what happens with Neff as his life crumbles apart as he stands to lose everything.A solid film indeed as Billy Wilder directs this immensely engaging story. Told in the form of Neff's confession overnight, with the introduction of Neff who falls for the gorgeous Phyllis. The other stand out character being Barton Keyes who is the claims manager and Neff's only friend. Billy Wilder gives enough time for Neff and Phyllis's relationship, quite scandalous for the 1940s. The step daughter Lola's strained relationship with Phyllis as her sub plot though not fully utilized, plays another important part in elevating the drama. As the first half firmly executes the perfect crime, the story gets instantly elevated with the clever Keyes and his keen eyes that probes every single detail. The final act with the dejected Neff is very well performed too with a memorable confrontational scene. The other stand out is the final conversation with Keyes himself. A must watch."
clive-38,"Oct 3, 2000",10/10,"Although made in 1944 ""Double Indemnity"" still packs a punch today with its racy (for 1944) dialogue and fast moving plot. Definitely a 10/10.  The three leading players (Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson) have never been better and give powerful performances.  In my opinion Fred MacMurray should have won the Best Actor Oscar for his offbeat casting as Walter Neff, Billy Wilder deserved to win as Best Director and the film should have had Best Picture.  The three major awards that year all went to ""Going My Way"".  (Ironically, Billy Wilder won Best Director the following year for ""The Lost Weekend"" which also won Best Picture so that was some consolation for losing out with ""Double Indemnity"").  This is one of those films which can be enjoyed over and over again with repeated viewings - a ""film noir"" masterpiece.  ""Double Indemnity"" is the film that first made me aware of Billy Wilder as a director who then went on to make many other classic movies such as ""Sunset Boulevard"", ""Ace in the Hole"" (also known as ""the Big Carnival""), ""Stalag 17"", ""Some Like It Hot"", ""The Apartment"" and several others.   Worthy of being in anyone's ""Top Ten"" list of the best films ever made! Clive Roberts."

alekspredator87,"Jul 11, 2024",7/10,"""Double Insurance"", shot in 1944 by director Billy Wilder, is one of the iconic films in the noir genre. This movie is remembered for its dark atmosphere, ingenious plot and outstanding acting, making it a must-watch for all fans of classic cinema.The plot of the film revolves around the insurance agent Walter Neff (Fred McMurray), who becomes a participant in an insidious conspiracy after meeting the seductive Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck). Phyllis persuades Walter to help her kill her husband in order to get insurance under a ""double insurance"" policy, which doubles the amount of payment in case of an accident. It seems that the crime was planned perfectly, but ... of course, there is a ""but"", otherwise the film would not have been. The couple runs into Neff's suspicious boss, Barton Kiesa (Edward G. Robinson), which leads to a tense and exciting development of events. Even after telling the whole story, you still need to watch the picture. It is the action on the screen that will allow you to feel the whole atmosphere of this work.The decoration of this film is acting. Fred McMurray as Walter Neff embodies a kind of ideal of an ""antihero"", showing the internal contradictions and complexity of his character. His performance makes Neff both sympathetic and morally ambiguous, which enhances the drama of the picture.Barbara Stanwyck brilliantly plays the role of Phyllis Dietrichson, playing a cold and calculating woman whose charm hides the true danger. Her acting gives the film the necessary tension, you understand how dangerous a person hiding behind a pleasant appearance can be. It seems to be no secret, but the creators of the picture make subtle accents on the intentions of the girl that she is ready to go to great lengths for the sake of her goal.Edward G. Robinson as Barton Kees is also impressive for his depth and insight. His character, despite the seeming secondary role, plays in fact a key role in the development of the plot and the disclosure of the moral aspects of the story. Robinson masterfully conveys Kiesz's determination and intelligence, making him one of the most memorable characters in the film. Robinson is good, definitely good.Billy Wilder's direction in ""Double Insurance"" is excellent. The author masterfully creates an atmosphere of tension and paranoia, using the play of light and shadow to create a visually expressive world characteristic of the noir genre. Together with the cameraman John F. Sayz, Wilder creates a painting that delights with its aesthetics and depth.The script, written by Wilder and the famous detective writer Raymond Chandler, is an example of plot construction with layered characters and sharp dialogues. The story unfolds with inexorable logic, gradually revealing all the nuances and hidden motives of the characters. The director leads the viewer through his project, literally revealing page after page, through dialogues showing the whole background of this story. And this requires the viewer's attention to the details of the painting even more.The film received seven Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Despite numerous nominations, the film did not receive any awards, losing in many to the triumphant of that year, Leo McQueary's film ""Go Your Own Way"". That's what the Academy ordered.In general, ""Double Insurance"" is a worthy representative of classic Hollywood, which remains relevant today thanks to its clever staging, powerful acting and script. The film deserves its place in the pantheon of great works of cinema, and in 1992 it was even awarded a place in the US National Film Registry.7 out of 10."
Steve-318,"Dec 30, 2000",9/10,"Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray star in the Billy Wilder masterpiece that not only stands as the greatest insurance film ever made but one of Hollywood's top murder mysteries.Stanwyck is absolutely riveting as the wife looking for a change.  She charges the screen with so much electricity you don't need to plug in your VCR.It's always good to see MacMurray in something more uplifting than ""My Three Sons.""  Then there's Edward G. Robinson in the support role which he turns into a major presence.  One of the best scenes in the movie features the pompous head of the insurance company who interviews Stanwyck in front of Robinson and MacMurray(in order to ""show them how it's done"").  Edward G gets all the good lines, and in a Wilder script, that's a lot.A movie that refuses to be dated, ""Double Indemnity"" makes the case for simplicity in a story.  Lay it down and just let it happen.  Of course, it doesn't hurt to have Stanwyck along for the ride."
lagudafuad,"Feb 26, 2013",7/10,"The movie is about greed and seduction with a plot that probably won't fly in the modern film era, as it would be ripped apart by forensic evidence and detections; but in the 40s such science was not that much available so the plot was just right. The plot is about an insurance salesman (Fred Mac Murray) who got lured (which was quite easy due to his greed) into insurance fraud. The story was simple he taught, all he had to do was kill the lady he so desires husband and make it look like an accident, while tricking him to sign an accident insurance policy where everything goes to his lady friend, so he will get the girl and with her comes the money.The movie is best put using the word nice, and a classic as it has come to be. Double Indemnity is beautiful and captivating, based on a 1943 novel of the same name by James M. Cain. This movie was the height of film noir in the 40s spring out many copycat B movies from other producers.The screenplay is penned down by Billy Wilder, who also directed the movie, and from the way the movie drove you just have to appreciate the work of the screen writer, I while watching I was so eager to know if they will get away with it or not. Fred MacMurray narrated and starred in the movie, although the movie was a huge critical success and was nominated for seven Academy Awards but did not win any. Billy Wilder's writing and directing of this movie is a masterpiece worth treasuring and a work of art worth owning.The movie and the book's idea is based on the Double indemnity clause provided in life insurance or accident policy whereby the insurance company agrees to pay the stated multiple (double) of the face amount in the contract in the case of death caused by accidental means.The movie was a box office success making over 5 times its production cost, and the cinematography used ""venetian blind"" lighting which became popular in later film noirs. Double Indemnity was well received by the American Film Institute, in AFI's 100 Years100 Movies (10th Anniversary Edition) it was rated 29th; it also got other American Film Institute recognitions.This movie is wonderful, so if you have not seen or heard about the movie now you have so go see it.www.lagsreviews.com"

classicalsteve,"Aug 19, 2006",10/10,"What makes ""Doubled Indemnity"" more sinister and ultimately more disturbing than other movies of its type are the movies' characters, or better said the ""station"" of the characters. Unlike other noir classics such as ""Public Enemy"", ""Detour"", and ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", the characters of DI are not half-forgotten lowlifes crawling in the gutter of society. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck are upright respectable people. MacMurray is an insurance agent, and Stanwyck, who is married to a rich businessman, lives among the Los Angeles upper-crust. I can't remember if her house is supposed to be in Beverly Hills, but it is in one of the more exclusive areas of LA.These two characters do not engage in their illicit activities for reasons of pure survival as in ""Postman"" or ""Detour"". Their motivation is far more complex and terrifying. They are bored with their present situations. MacMurray realizes that as an insurance agent, he is on a permanent plateau financially. He will probably never exceed what money he has already made. Stanwyck, despite being the wife of a wealthy man, finds her life dull, without excitement, without sex. MacMurray wants greater financial power. She wants greater sexual power and freedom. When the two meet, they sense a strange chemistry in which each can gain something from the other. MacMurray can gain wealth and higher standing from Stanwyck. Stanwyck can gain freedom with the help of MacMurray. And the means to these ends is an insurance policy. Stanwyck holds the policy but MacMurray understands certain implications about the policy that is not even known to Stanwyck. From this very simple seed, an insurance agent, his client, and an insurance policy, grows crime, betrayal, and murder.And yet these characters are people you might have met in town in 1944. Typical upstanding citizens. And yet what lurks inside them seems at first hideous and evil. And yet, strangely familiar... The characters of DI represent the darker sides that we all have within us. Every hetero male has moments when he might covet the beautiful wife of a wealthy neighbor or acquaintance and wished for a moment that he could take the other man's place. And isn't there something deep inside some hetero married females who wish they could extract themselves from their marriage without losing their wealth?Certainly, the actions that lead to the undoing of MacMurray and Stanwyck may be grotesque on the surface. But deeper inside, the motivations behind their behavior represent something that is inside many of us. We identify with these characters while the morale of society says we should not."

If you want to know why Robinson was a screen legend just see him in this film.MacMurray's character is interesting because you wonder why a likable guy like him would ever get involved with a spider like Stanwyck.Stanwyck plays the conniving wife for everything she's got.Double Indemnity is a classic of film noir and is ranked #38 on the American Film Institute's top 100 movie list.

They seem to be getting away with the perfect murder but his boss doesn't want to pay up and Keyes has one of his hunches.This is one of the iconic film noir. Fred MacMurray is a natural insurance salesman. He fits the role perfectly and his corruption is completely believable. It's inspired casting from Billy Wilder. On the other hand, Barbara Stanwyck is the easy choice. She is great as the phony femme fatale. And it's never wrong to cast Edward G. Robinson.

Easily MacMurray's best role on the big screen. Wonderful supporting work from Edward G. Robinson. Stanwyck is terrific, as well, although selling her as the kind of woman a man could fall in lust with at first sight is one of the film's only flaws. Beautifully shot by John Seitz. The incredible score is courtesy of Miklós Rózsa. A lot of top talent worked on this. Nominated for seven Oscars, it took home zero. Which is a crying shame, especially with regard to the screenplay written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, adapted from a novel by James M. Cain.

Atropos790,"Nov 29, 2001",N/A,"Double indemnity is a Film Noir classic. Director Billy Wilder gives the film the classic Noir look, with dark shadows and a twisted murder plot. Whether it's the darkness of a house or a poorly lit street the scenes are given an attitude by the lighting that Wilder chose. Walter Neff, played by Fred MacMurray is pushed in the middle of a femme fatales' unscrupulous scheme.  Neff an insurance salesman is coaxed into a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. Neff gets lured into this plot of deceit because of an anklet that the femme fatale, Phyllis Dietrichson played by Barbara Stanwyck, wears throughout the film.  Stanwyck's performance is superb, she plays a cold-blooded woman with a mindset of taking what she believes belongs to her. Dietrichson is nonchalant, and methodical when it comes to her femme fatale characteristics. Neff and Dietrichson tend to light up the dark scenes with their lustful looks towards each other.  Lola, Phyllis' stepdaughter, on the other hand  is the complete opposite of the femme fatale. Jean Heather playing Lola does an excellent job of selling her character as an innocent and meek teenager wary of her stepmother's actions.  Edward G. Robinson plays Barton Keyes an insurance investigator with a `little man' that gives him clues to the status of a claim. Keyes is like a father figure to Neff and they spend much time together as Keyes throws his ideas of what happened around.This was a great film going to great lengths to please the viewer.  This Film not only leans towards the serious side but also has some comic relief mainly in the use of the word baby, and the endless search for one mans matches.  A great work of art Double Indemnity should be on everyone's list of movies to see soon. It will not only keep you wrapped up but also will keep you on the edge of your seat waiting for the next plot twist."
adventure-21903,"May 25, 2019",10/10,"Billy Wilder my candidate for the finest director in Hollywood history with the body of work that is legendary: Sunset Blvd, A Foreign Affair, Some Like It Hot, Stalag 17, The Apartment, etc film this splendid noir film in gorgeous black and white. Wilder worked with the best of Hollywood: Bill Holden, Jean Arthur, Jack Lemmon, and most famously Marilyn Monroe.Barbara Stanwyck is magnificent as the cold-blooded wife who enlists Fred MacMurray into murdering her wealthy husband. Stanwyck is sex personified
without ever removing a garment.Barbara Stanwyck never won an Oscar. if there ever was a explanation it would be that Stanwyck was always perfect in every role she ever did. the Academy made up for this error by awarding Stanwyck an much deserved honorary Oscar."
bobsgrock,"Jan 26, 2008",10/10,"I love the way Billy Wilder was so willing to take risks and go and do a film that no other director would touch. He pushed the envelope three major times in his career, this being the first one. By casting Barbara Stanwyck, arguably the biggest female star of the time, and Fred MacMurray, who was known at the time for doing family-type comedy, as two lovers who commit murder to get money, he created a new standard in casting as well as making the definitive film noir. It may not be the best one, but it's up there and the reason, in this critic's opinion, belongs to MacMurray. He is so good in every scene, whether he is flirting, murdering, or simply narrating, he convinces you all the way and makes you wish that he hadn't made the mistake of going to the Dietrichson house that sunny afternoon. Stanwyck is devilish as the femme fatale and Edward G. Robinson is so smooth as a fast-talking, intelligent insurance claims adjuster who lets nothing get in his way from solving a mysterious case. This is writing and directing at its finest. Do not miss this absolute classic."
tim777ca,"Aug 16, 2002",8/10,"The movie is widely regarded as a great American classic because of its film noir atmosphere and sharp dialogue, but I don't think it holds up so well.It makes a big deal on solving a murder case plotted by Stanwyck and MacMurray. Actually the case is quite simple, I wonder why the police concludes it as accidental death, because the train was only running fifteen miles an hour when Barbara's husband presumably fell off by himself. If they just investigate the cause of death of the body and the fingerprints on his crutches, they'd easily find out the truth. There's no need for Robinson to use his brain so hard!"
malkane316,"May 15, 2004",9/10,"Where Some like it Hot is a basic, one joke movie, loved by almost everyone (me excluded), Double Indemnity has enough wit, suspense, and plot twists to satisfy lovers of comedy, and crime dramas. Stanwyck is immortalised as the archetypal femme fatale (I hate labels), Macmurray is at times naïve, independent, lonely, and funny, though Robinson outshines the rest of the cast. Not stopping until he unravels the crime, mind full of statistics and possible scenarios, and trusting no-one, every scene he is in, is a classic. although i haven't read the book, i have read much other Noir, and while this is nowhere near as violent or erotic as those, it retains their atmosphere, and the feel of the period. 9 out of 10"
barrwell,"Oct 22, 2010",10/10,"When I think of just what film-noir is, I think of love triangles, a femme-fa tale, dimly lit sets. lights and shadows, slick operators looking to score and finally, some desperate crime born of their lust and depravity. Double Indemnity contains all these elements and defines this genre better than any movie I've ever seen. I have to give this movie a 10 and not because I like giving perfect scores but because of the towering performances of three of the all time great actors of American film as well the masterful directing and writing of Billy Wilder. I've been a big Billy Wilder fan for some years now and I believe this is his masterpiece.Wilder directed and co-wrote (with Raymond Chandler) Double Indemnity, and worked hard to convince the two stars, Barbara Stanwyck and Fred McMurray to overcome their hesitancy and join him in this endeavor. Both didn't like the idea of playing these shady characters, but because they did we end up with possibly the best acting trio (along with Edward G. Robinson) ever in one film. Bold statement yes, but I'm talking about PERFECT casting here...straight down the line.Stanwyck plays Phyllis Dietrichson, she's married to an older man who she detests and one day a wise-cracking insurance salesman named Walter Neff (McMurray) comes to the door and they begin talking...or should I say flirting. This marvelous introductory scene is the essence of film-noir, filled with fast lines with double meanings and it really captivates us right from the start. Phyllis asks about accident insurance for her husband and the banter continues and then Neff leaves. He leaves, but hes hooked (as are we), and later Phyllis stops by his apartment and they get closer and start plotting. Wouldn't it be nice if they could knock off her hubby and split the insurance payout?What a premise; this is the ultimate film-noir plot setup. They start meeting secretly and planning, meanwhile Neff tries to keep his prying (and extremely perceptive) boss Keyes (Robinson) at arms length. Edward G. Robinson, playing against type as an all-consumed, almost anal claims investigator, gives a performance that is truly the foundation of this film. Stanwyck, to me is maybe the most talented all-around actress in Hollywood history and the extremely under-rated McMurray (also cast against type) displays an easy charm that covers up his building anxiety, and they are both fantastic, but Robinson absolutely shines as the insurance scam expert who claims the ""little man in my stomach"" won't let him rest easy. There's a brilliant scene where Keyes shoots down his bosses' idea of the crime being a suicide by quoting statistics from actuary tables and you'd think at the time he was in on the plot with Neff (of course we know he isn't) because he is so convincing and compelling. I really think its one of the greatest supporting performances ever in film.We get some of the little plot twists that we'd expect in a film-noir, as Walter and Phyllis decide whether they should even contact each other until the heat dies down. Walter at times seems to be coming completely unglued while Phyllis' cold, conniving exterior is hiding secrets she hasn't told anyone. The great fun in watching Double Indemnity is just watching these incredible stars do their thing. There aren't any shoot-outs or big explosions or effects like you see in todays films, instead there is the charisma of three extremely talented actors who absolutely radiate their skills in the hands of one the best directors in history.So sit back and enjoy a masterpiece of film. This is what movies used to be about when acting, writing and directing were often honed to perfection.BTW..If you like this film and want some other Wilder films try; The Lost Weekend (Ray Milland) or Stalag 17 or Sunset Blvd (William Holden) or The Apartment (Jack Lemmon)...These are all critically acclaimed and all of these except Stalag 17 are on the AFI Top 100 list....but (to me) Double Indemnity is the best of them all, enjoy."
aleksandraryan,"Mar 31, 2021",7/10,"The cinematography and lighting, with that dark moody feel, made this film a classic noir film. Since taking a film class, I definitely pick up on aspects of films I never have before. The acting in the film was done very well. Barbara Stanwych did a fantastic job at being a cold and manipulating lead. She had just the right amount of sex appeal to make you want to like her, yet her actions make her root against her. The acting was very well done, but this wasn't my favorite movie to watch."
jim-539,"Mar 31, 2002",N/A,I saw it when it first came out and was immediately grabbed by it.I've seen it several times since then and have never been disappointed.it seems to be the perfect film noir movie.It has an enormous charge.It's just a very good movie.Superb script.The interaction between all the principals never fails to carry one along
hitchcockthelegend,"Nov 5, 2017",10/10,"Double Indemnity is directed by Billy Wilder and Wilder co-adapts the screenplay with Raymond Chandler from the novella written by James M. Cain. It stars Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck and Edward G. Robinson. Music is by Miklos Rozsa and cinematography by John F. Seitz.For a film lover such as myself it feels redundant writing a review for Double Indemnity, because quite simply there's nothing to say that hasn't been said already. The esteem it is held in is justified, it's a razor sharp noir across the board and can be put up as one of the classic noir era pictures that got lovers of the form interested in the first place.Based around the infamous Snyder/Gray case of 1927, Wilder and Chandler fill the story with a sinister cynicism that is palpable in the extreme. With a script positively pumped with hard boiled dialogue, a simple case of murder becomes so much more, a labyrinth of devious cunning and foolishness, with a trio of top performances crowning this topper.Technically via aural and visual work the story gains extra spice. Rosza provides a score that frays the nerves, imbuing the sense of doom and edginess required for plotting. Seitz excels, the photography a trademark for noir, heavy shadows, abrupt camera angles and menacing shards of light come to the fore.And to top it all off, it gets away with so much, a real censorship baiter. The story takes a journey to the dark side of morality, and the makers, bless them for they know what they do, gleefully tease the production code to give film noir fans a reason to rejoice.Quintessential stuff. 10/10"
fullthundermoon-36564,"Jul 25, 2021",10/10,Easily the best film noir. Ticks every box twice. Straight down the line... lol.
rupie,"Feb 28, 2024",8/10,"When you look up the word ""iconic"" in your Funk & Wagnalls, you'll find this movie listed as Exhibit A. Billy Wilder was a genius both as a writer and as a filmmaker. It's no surprise that, with such outstanding co-writers as Raymond Chandler and James M. Cain, the script is superb. The cast is outstanding. Fred MacMurray and Barbara Stanwyck have great chemistry, but for my money Edward G. Robinson, in a supporting role, stands out. The dramatic line never sags from the foreboding opening to the inevitable tragic conclusion. It's no exaggeration to say that this classic movie is one of the handful of truly great film noirs (or is it films noir?)."
catfanatic888,"Jun 2, 2020",10/10,Fred MacMurray & Barbara Stanwyck sizzle together with some of the best lines ever to grace the golden screen. There's been so many murder mysteries through the years but THIS ONE is a standout! I have seen it multiple times and I still enjoy every scene and every moment of dialogue. And the BEST PART is that it still holds up today.
shavlor,"Nov 19, 2003",8/10,Double Indemnity is a solid movie.The acting is good. The plot is well thought out. But to top things off the entire way the movie is portrayed is excellent (the use of the narrator).Recommended to anyone and everyone. Warning the movie is not action filled and might seem slow to some at times.
jon_pratt12345,"Jan 29, 2022",7/10,Fast-paced film noir that felt absurd at times and didn't like to waste time in trying to convey water-tight realism or even convincing character behaviour. It still works as a thrilling watch told through a fun flash-back lens.
jone6543,"Aug 27, 2007",9/10,"I have watched DOUBLE INDEMNITY probably no less than 10 times. It entertains me each and every time.I think the movie is cast perfectly. Fred MacMurray, Barbara Stanwyck & Edward G. Robinson are all excellent. They played it out to perfection.Fred MacMurray was only known to me as the father on ""My Three Sons"" the first time I saw this movie. I loved him as Walter Neff. He played it so well - very believable.And Barbra Stanwyck as Phillis Dietrichson... Oh my gosh! She has been one of my favorites for a while. She, as usual, plays ""the bad woman"" so well. She makes you believe she could get a man do anything she wants. I will say, I very much dislike her hair in this movie. It is very unflattering.Edward G. Robinson is so funny & odd to me. I love to see him in movies. He balanced out the cast perfectly."
JeanS-47r,"May 3, 2025",7/10,"Great classic. The cinematography is gorgeous with no rough edges or shaky moments, instead it is all fluid and beautiful, and the costumes, sets and scenery also help. Also superb are Miklos Rozsa's wonderfully atmospheric score, the compelling story which sizzles with romance and sexual tension and the truly crackling screenplay. The acting also is impressive. Fred MacMurray overplays slightly, but this is one of the cases when overplaying works, because he is still witty and charming as well. Barbara Stanwyck I think is sexy, her character appeals and her dialogue is so good as is her delivery of it, while Edward G. Robinson gives a superb supporting performance."
ziyadsaadi,"Apr 2, 2005",N/A,"Double Indemnity is a great film noir that keeps your heart beating and your palms sweating. But none of the greatness in this film could have been achieved without the three best aspects:1) John Seitz's stunning cinematography. No other film-noir has managed to contrast black and white so vividly as to capture the perfect mood of the story and characters. Because of this technical achievement, the viewer can't take his eyes of the screen.2) Barbara Stanwyck's beautiful performance. Only until Gloria Swanson in Sunset Blvd. has there been such a mesmerizing femme fatale. She underplays every line and fills it with innocence, seduction, despair, desperation, and love. She IS Phyllis Dietrichson.3) Billy Wilder's unforgettable script. A story that nowadays would seem simple turns in great dialogue, plot twists, and a narrative structure that keeps you on the edge of your seat right from the start. The characters do exactly what they're supposed to do and the script shows you exactly how and why.Other great aspects include the direction, the settings, the music, and the great performances by Robinson and MacMurray."
intelearts,"Feb 7, 2009",10/10,"Double Idemnity is very fine film-making - with both Raymond Chandler and Billy Wilder on board and a killer cast (pun intended) it's a winner all the way.For us it's the script, the cool, almost bebop rhythm of the words, staccato and tense - it must have been amazing to hear this first time round - a use of language that just blows you away every time.An excellent plot, brilliant filming, and great acting all the way - murder never seemed so easy or the guilt and repercussions so brilliantly handled.It still works - 65 years on this is still a fresh slice of cinema that deserves each of its seven Oscar nominations - dark, cold, twisted - brilliant!"
Leofwine_draca,"Jul 17, 2015",8/10,"DOUBLE INDEMNITY is pretty much a perfect film noir thriller, directed to the hilt by Billy Wilder and containing cracking performances, a near-perfect script, and a solid storyline. The tale, about an insurance agent who falls for a classic femme fatale and then conspires with her to bump off her husband, is simple in the telling, and much familiar from other similar fare, like THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE. But it's the execution where this film really delivers.Barbara Stanwyck is an intense delight as the ultimate femme fatale; completely cold-blooded, a literally chilling character. It's testament to Fred MacMurray's acting ability that his character continues to hold the audience's sympathies despite his murderous behaviour, while Edward G. Robinson brings warmth and humour as his boss. The real star, of course, is the script, written by Billy Wilder and Raymond Chandler, which screams quality throughout. Wilder's expressive direction - all ominous music, shadows, and tension - is the icing on the cake. Having read Zola's THERESE RAQUIN recently, I'm surprised by the similarities to that novel, which was clearly a huge inspiration."
richardchatten,"Jan 25, 2022",10/10,"This cynical masterpiece in the words of Edward G. Robinson ""all fits together like a watch"", practically invented the film noir in one go, begins with a credit sequence worthy of Saul Bass and crackles throughout with sensational dialogue much of it delivered by Robinson.My one reservation is the heretical view that as the treacherous wife Barbara Stanwyck gives possibly her worst performance. Saddled with a hideous wig, she's simply too sympathetic an actress to be this one-dimensionally evil.I never thought I'd hear myself saying this but the role would have suited Joan Crawford better."
snoozejonc,"Feb 5, 2021",10/10,"An insurance salesman makes a confession about his role in a murder.Double Indemnity is a brilliant noir with a clever plot, memorable scenes, classic dialogue and some great performances.Hundreds of reviews have been written about this movie, so I'll stick to what left the most lasting impression on me.The plot is a pretty simple tale of infatuation, crime and punishment with a novel approach to story narration. Walter Neff is so tortured by his secrets and unraveling deception that the confession he gives feels almost like therapy.The depiction of two people involved in something illicit is one of the best I have seen. It is very much from the one perspective, but it's very plausible how the relationship develops through lust, infatuation, exhilaration, anxiety, paranoia and repulsion. There could just as well be no murder and the couple be simply involved in an affair and the arc of their relationship would be just as effective. Watching the movie I felt up to my neck in it just as much as Neff.Most of the dialogue is very sharp and darkly humorous. The initial banter between Neff and Mrs Dietrichson is some of the best I've heard, whilst pretty much everything that comes from Keyes is solid gold.Moments of suspense are plentiful and what makes it all the more impressive is that I was so immersed in some moments I forgot I was seeing part of a retrospect narrative.If you appreciate striking, high contrast, shadowy, suggestive, cinematography that tells a visual story, this has plenty. There is one fantastic shot where Mrs Dietrichson sits in deep focus in the background, framed between her husband and lover, as the two men agree an insurance contract. This and many others present wonderfully memorable imagery throughout the film. Never has the striking of a match and lighting of a cigarette been so poignant.Most performances are excellent, with Fred McMurray a solid lead who I believed had both the strength and weaknesses his character displayed. Barbara Stanwyck is phenomenally convincing as a sultry femme fatale, fully capable of winding a man round her little finger with the merest of facial expressions combined with a subtle reveal of an anklet. Edward G Robinson electrifies every scene with his energy, charisma and star presence. Some of the other performances are not as enjoyable, but that's only a minor flaw in an almost perfect picture.For me it's a 9.5/10 but I like to round upwards."
chloejfilmstudent,"Aug 6, 2017",7/10,"If you are a noir fan then this film is an absolute must see. The screenplay itself is a work of art in its character construction, plot structure and dialogue which is delivered by an ensemble of first class actors divying up first class performances. Barbra Stanwyck as the deadly, smouldering, scheming Phyllis Dietrichson turns in a performance that is right up there with Mary Astor's Brigid O'Shaughnessy. Fred McMurray delivers a performance of a smart but desperately lovelorn patsy and Edward G. Robinson is perfect in the role of Barton Keyes and just about steals the moment every time he appears on screen.I personally love a good Noir film and this is right up there with the best of them. Billy Wilder should be proud of this work even though the Academy didn't see it fit to reward him for his efforts, however I personally think this film is an absolute winner."
bob the moo,"Aug 29, 2006",N/A,"Returning to his office late one night, insurance salesman Walter Neff picks up his tape recorder and begins to record a message to his boss Barton Keyes. The message is a confession of a crime that Walter has committed and starts the day he made a casual sales call to businessman Dietrichson. It was here where Neff first met the beautiful and playful Mrs Phyllis Dietrichson and started to flirt with her. When she invites him back another day to sign papers he goes like a dog on heat but recoils when she floats the idea that he help her take out a hefty accident policy without his knowledge. However Phyllis is very persuasive and soon he decides to not only help sign her husband up but help to kill him in such a way that she will gain the maximum money but not arouse the suspicion of the insurance investigators.Not a name that I really associate with noir or tough drama, this Billy Wilder film was a real joy to watch as it delivers a noir story with plenty of sharp dialogue and tough acting. The story sees Neff being seduced by Phyllis and getting drawn into ""the perfect crime"" which quickly turns sour once his boss Keyes starts sniffing around it. It works on several levels, not the least of which is the sexual power that the audience sees shifting in the early stages. At the start it appears that Neff has all the power as he flirtatiously circles Phyllis, however soon his panting is soon turned on him but the script does well to keep him from knowing it and instead has him continue thinking he has the power. It is a genre staple but it works well here and the characters, although cookie-cutter, are good. Following genre lines, the film builds up to the crime before seeing it crumble and, although we know the rough outcome due to the narrator-structuring it is still engaging as it develops and we follow Neff as he gets in over his head.Wilder's direction is solid and he uses shadow really well, easily moving the action away from the sharp daylight where we first see Neff and Phyllis meet. Wilder's script is beefed up by Chandler and together they have produced plenty of tough but convincing dialogue which gives the film a real hard edge to it and befits the genre. The cast also fit the genre well. MacMurray is hardly the most emotive man in the world but he is perfect here as a tough nut who falls in due to desire. He works well with Stanwyck who is good as the femme fatale even if she didn't totally convince me all the time. That said she was playful and manipulative most of the time, which is what the character needed. Robinson steals his scenes with a colourful and lively performance that contrast well with the darker scenes.Overall this is a classic piece of noir with all the genre staples accounted for and done really well. Easily engaging and enjoyable with fine direction and solid performances and well worth a watch for those familiar or unfamiliar with the genre."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Oct 24, 2018",9/10,My Rating : 9/10Razor-sharp script and acting. It's how the story has been told which makes it effective. Billy Wilder's direction is flawless.A thoroughly entertaining drama and one of the best from the classic era.
EUyeshima,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"The crackling, whip-smart dialogue provided by master film auteur Billy Wilder and supreme crime novelist Raymond Chandler is what makes this 1944 film noir such a timeless classic, certainly among the very best of the genre. Considering this was just the third film he directed, Wilder is already at the top of his game here in this adaptation of a James Cain novella about a sleazy hotshot insurance man named Walter Neff, who is out to renew an auto insurance claim with a wealthy oil driller named Dietrichson. The man isn't home but his lethally cool wife Phyllis is, and the sexual combustion between them is palpable from the moment they meet. Told in flashback, the story unfolds constant layers of duplicity by stupid, morally bankrupt people - which is why this film is so much fun to watch, simply because the behavior is twisted in a rather exaggerated manner that makes you cringe and laugh at the same time.It certainly helps that Wilder cast three actors who turn in exemplary performances. In an about-face from his usually genial roles, Fred MacMurray is surprisingly effective as a man weakened by his passions and seeking salvation far too late. It's easily his best screen work at least until Wilder cast him as the immoral, adulterous office boss in another classic, ""The Apartment"", sixteen years later. Calculating and seductive in a cheap blond wig and a provocative anklet, Barbara Stanwyck personifies the hard-boiled dame with a brilliant turn as Phyllis. She is the role model for all femme fatales that came after her - including Kathleen Turner's star-making turn in ""Body Heat"" nearly forty years later. Walter and Phyllis claim to be in love, so much so that they plot to kill her husband for the insurance. But there is no love between these two - just reciprocal contempt. She's just a conquest to him, and he's a pawn to her. What's more, their plan is ridiculous. Neff breaks her husband's neck, and then they plant him on the railroad tracks to imply he fell off the back of a 15 mile per hour train after taking out a policy that pays double for a death on a train. As the most decent person of an unseemly lot, Edward G. Robinson portrays Barton Keyes, a wily insurance investigator who likes Walter in spite of himself and the revelations about him. It all ends the way you would expect but in such a darkly humorous way that it's enjoyable just to see how."
Somesweetkid,"Aug 24, 2020",9/10,"Upon my first and only viewing (to date) of this movie, I was distracted by FM's constant reference to BS as ""baby."" Yes, this term was common for 40's movies but it was overdone. Consequently, it gave a false note to the movie as I'm guessing it was meant to give FM's character more of a hard-boiled, sexist edge. Or maybe I watched too many episodes of ""My Three Sons"" as a youth and could only envision old Freddie as a laid back, non-cursing widower. Other than the ""baby"" nitpicking on my part, I did find the dialogue and repartee witty on the part of the three main characters. EGR was especially enjoyable and I've never appreciated him as much as I did in this movie. However, due to the unconvincing and constant use of the ""baby"" moniker for Babs' ""Phyllis"" by FM's ""Walter,"" I give DI a 9/10."
The_Double-Thinker,"Jun 22, 2007",10/10,"One of the greatest movies of all time. This movie is brilliant in every sense of the word. Technically it plays with shadow as well as any movie ever. It is as dark a movie as can be made without the screen being totally black. The shadows cast by the venetian blinds are beautiful and terrifying. The story is of an insurance salesman(MacMurray) who is quite taken with a lonely housewife (Stanwyck). Together the two plan to do away with the husband of the woman by putting into motion what they both consider to be the perfect crime. It is nearly impossible to find better written dialog. The script crackles with funny one-liners and great plays-on-words. Innuendo has never been better. This is one of my all time favorite movies. The characters are unhappy and bitter people, as they should be in any great film noir. The movie is so simple and yet so complex , making it perfect. The best film noir ever and easily one of the best movies ever made."
johnnyboyz,"Sep 6, 2007",9/10,"So very rarely do you get such a film that withstands the test of time without being too innovative. Films such as Citizen Kane, Casablanca and 2001: A Space Odyssey are all fantastic examples of what film can be and how a single film of however long can innovate, entertain and spellbind at the same time but something so simple and so straightforward as Double Indemnity can also prove to be of equal quality.Double Indemnity is not a film that is particularly visual, it's not a film that relies on standout performances or lines of dialogue that you hear quoted and see spoofed in other films years later; but where the genius and I must emphasise 'genius' lies is in its camera control and emphases on character and plot. The way the camera is used as an actual 'tool' rather than something to just point and shoot, the way the character of Phyllis (Stanwyck) is glamorised but at the same time presented in a dangerous way and of course, the break-neck pace in which the film moves along all culminate in a film experience that is truly entertaining and that gives us an education; not only in film but in morality.I mentioned the script has no standout lines but the way the characters communicate to one another is funny and so realistic, it's like being in the rooms with them. The way Walter (MacMurray) talks to his work colleague Barton (Robinson) about the case once its been carried out is not only fascinating because we know the truth but also just merely entertaining. There is no ""Here's looking at you kid"" or ""Open the pod bay doors"" but instead a series of humorous lines, witty put downs and amusing anecdotes; my favourite being when Walter's talking about insurance to a semi naked Phyllis and he states that he'd hate the household not to be ""fully covered"". I also liked the way the narration puts you in the film  Walter describes just about everything he does and everywhere he goes. He tells us what he's feeling and even what he smells: Honeysuckle in the air, last nights party cigars in the hosting room. We find out how he feels as we centre around him; I ask you: how many films are there that attach us to a character so much that we feel what he's feeling because he's telling us what it's actually like?Once all the classic flirting between Walter and Phyllis as well as the now iconic way in which she is glamorised through the camera as it moves with her, focuses on certain body parts and has her wear what it is she chooses to wear, the film beds down into the actual act of crime in sets up so well. The tension and atmosphere during the second third and beyond is tense enough but when little things pop up such as the injuring of Phyllis' husband's leg as well as suspicions in the office scene that includes a company chief suspecting foul play whilst Walter and Phyllis herself stand and sit waiting the outcome is brilliant as it's unpredictable. Barton's persistence in the office scene just involving Walter is fantastic as is when he turns up at Walter's flat when we are all expecting Phyllis any moment.Few other films get more and more intense as the plot carries on  it's like the scene of the crime as the detective tries to find clues only the scene is one massive world of evidence, witnesses, murder and suspects and the twist is that our protagonist is the guy who's got to pray nobody cracks the case. As an example of film noir, Double Indemnity is as good as it gets; as an example of story telling Double Indemnity is again, as good as it gets. In fact whatever things Double Indemnity does do in a minor and unspectacular fashion, it still manages to pull off as either mere entertainment or as tension wrought twists of the knife."
Bored_Dragon,"Nov 3, 2018",7/10,"This film noir is nominated for seven Oscars, considered one of the best in the genre, and even one of the best movies overall. It is undisputedly good film, but I wouldn't place it so high. The story is very good, but quite predictable, and the performances of the leading actors weren't convincing enough to me. It's like they didn't know their lines by heart, as they struggled too much. Maybe it's just me, but I simply didn't buy it. Wilder, on the other hand, nailed it as usual.7/10"
dave13-1,"Apr 19, 2012",9/10,"All of the elements of a great noir drama are here: the scheming woman who snares a weakling man in her web. The dark, tightly composed shots of people in fear - fear of being caught, exposed. Inky blotches of darkness intruding from the edge of almost every scene like an organic presence. The nervous, gloomy atmosphere of doomed characters being hounded and chased. The cast is marvelous, especially Stanwyck, usually typed in reliable roles, but here cast against type as a femme fatale. And the crackling 40s-style hard-boiled dialogue was co-written by none other than Raymond Chandler and adapted from the work of master storyteller James M. Cain.A remarkable achievement by a top collection of talent."
TheEmulator23,"Apr 30, 2008",7/10,"I imagine when this came out it was a great new thrill. However this film doesn't really hold up to well 60+ years later. As much as this is a good film, it really doesn't deserve to be in the top 250 of all time. This is a very solid film but there isn't anything great about it. I would recommend this to those that like good ol' fashioned noir flicks, but not to those that want something really original. I shouldn't say it's not original because it was then, but it has been done a lot better since. If anything else the acting is the best thing going for it. Especially the always excellent Fred MacMurray although Barbara Stanwyck ain't no slacker either."

Double Indemnity is the King of all 1940's crime melodramas, told in a flashback style. A urban crime dramas in which a greedy, weak man, Fred MacMurry, is seduced and trapped by a cold, evil woman. Phyllis Dietrichson, Barbara Stanwyck, seduces the insurance agent Walter Neff Fred MacMurray into murdering her husband to collect his accident policy. Of course things turn out differently and things are not all as they seem. Chilling ending to an unforgettable movie."
FedRev,"Nov 13, 2014",10/10,"One of the best examples of Film Noir, Double Indemnity is a stylistic crime drama about an insurance salesman who is convinced to take part in a murder/fraud scheme by a beautiful woman. A great film to watch late at night, it's a claustrophobic masterpiece, told from the point of view of the criminals in an utterly dark and irredeemable environment. It has a razor sharp script and exquisite use of light and shadow, both of which came to define the Noir genre. While the film has no virtuous characters, not even the murder victim or the investigators looking into the crime, the film stands as a document on lust, corruption, and greed in a world where profit and self-preservation are primary values. Barbara Stanwyck and Fred MacMurray star in Billy Wilder's enduring, genre defining crime thriller."
tcchelsey,"Apr 7, 2024",10/10,"Director and screenwriter Billy Wilder said it wasn't easy to work with fellow writer Raymond Chandler (best known for THE BIG SLEEP). In fact, he said he may have drove Chandler back to the bottle. However, the end result --to this this day -- ranks as one of the Top 100 films of all time. In fact, author James Cain was quite impressed with the screenplay, especially with Fred MacMurray beginning the story, talking into a dictating machine. Cain's previous hit was THE POSTMAN ALWAYS RINGS TWICE.And what a story. Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) conspires with insurance man Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray) to kill her husband (Tom Powers) --so they can collect and live happily ever after? Enter wise, old insurance investigator Keyes ( played by Edward G. Robinson). And you have to love his name.The incredible dialogue, alone, is worth the price of admission. Interestingly, all three leads had reservations about their roles. Stanwyck, who at the time was the highest paid actress in Hollywood, was not thrilled playing such a ruthless character, but she took it on a dare. Likewise, Fred MacMurray, known for lighter roles, thought playing a killer was not his type. It was Billy Wilder who won him over. Originally, George Raft was considered for the lead, however he insisted the screenplay be changed and he be a cop?Edward G. Robinson thought getting third billing was not a wise choice. He changed his mind and it was the best decision he ever made.Famous costume designer Edith Head worked on Stanwyck's wardrobe, although Stanwyck did not like the blonde wig. She said it looked phony, and Wilder convinced her that was what her character was all about. Pretty clever stuff. Stanwyck was nominated for an Oscar, but lost out to Ingrid Bergman in GASLIGHT. A shame the Academy Awards did NOT have co-winners. Perhaps one of the toughest decisions ever made as to who would win Best Actress.Notes; Raymond Chandler is actually seen sitting outside Keyes office in one scene. Billy Wilder originally had Walter Neff go to the gas chamber, and the scene reportedly was filmed --but cut, considered too graphic. Stanwyck's beautiful home is still around, located on Quebec Drive, in the Beachwood Canyon area of Hollywood. Now valued at over three million dollars and then some.One fab-tabulous film, insuring multiple viewings. Forever on dvd and remastered blu ray. Always a thank you extended to TCM for running this masterpiece."
grantss,"Mar 4, 2017",9/10,"Walter Neff is an insurance salesman for Pacific All Risk Insurance Company. He falls for Phyllis Dietrichson, the wife of a client of his, and is drawn into a plan to kill Mr. Dietrichson and pocket the insurance money. Between the two of them they come up with the perfect murder, so good it not only looks like an accident, but ensures that the insurance pays out double the usual sum insured - double indemnity. Between them and the money stands Barton Keyes, Pacific Insurance's Head of Claims. Experienced, wily and possessing a sixth sense for claims fraud he is a formidable adversary...Brilliant crime drama - a film-noir classic. Written by Raymond Chandler book and directed by master-director Billy Wilder, this is great on so many levels: the clever plot (especially the murder plan, which is so good you almost want them to succeed); the snappy, often funny, dialogue and the excellent, engaging performances. Moreover, there's a smoothness and coolness about this, a hallmark of film noir.Only things missing from making this one of the greatest movies of all times is a good twist and possibly less predictability. The use of flashbacks to tell the story sort of gives away the direction the plot is taking.Good work by Fred MacMurray as Neff, Barbara Stanwyck as Phyllis and Edward G Robinson as Keyes. In hindsight, Humphrey Bogart would have made a better Neff, but then you could say that about any 1940s role requiring a cool, tough, smooth-talking, wise-cracking male lead. Fred MacMurray does well and doesn't really put a foot wrong, but I kept thinking ""Imagine Bogie in the role..."".Barbara Stanwyck got a well-deserved Best Leading Actress Oscar nomination for playing Phyllis.The film itself garnered seven Oscar nominations but no wins, losing out on Best Picture to Going My Way, the so-so musical starring Bing Crosby. Billy Wilder got his first Best Director nomination and fourth writing nomination for Double Indemnity. He would have to wait for his next movie, The Lost Weekend, for his first win."
jamesrupert2014,"Nov 22, 2018",8/10,"Walter Neff, an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) and Phyllis Dietrichson, an unhappy wife (Barbara Stanwyck) set up a (near) perfect insurance scam in this genre classic. The story by director Billy Wilder and crime-novelist Raymond Chandler is clever, with a well thought-out and executed plan with just enough weaknesses to ignite suspicions in Walter's boss, insurance investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). MacMurray (a boomer icon in ""My Three Sons"" (1960)) plays against type as weak-willed but cunning and duplicitous Neff, infatuated with Stanwyck's peroxide blond temptress. The film was an award winner despite being considered sordid by some critics and was famously boycotted by singer Kate Smith. Unmissable by noir fans and a good evening's entertainment for anyone else."
Artimidor,"May 6, 2012",10/10,"In order to begin a story with the ending and still maintain suspense throughout the movie a film-maker needs to be quite sure of his skills to capture the attention of his audience. Director/writer Billy Wilder, assisted by established novelist Raymond Chandler with the screenplay, knows how to do it. He presents his film noir entirely in flashbacks, narrated in atmospheric voice-overs leading eventually to what we've already seen in the introduction. And despite the fact that we know where it's all heading we're still glued to our seats. New at the time and often copied ever since, but rarely done that well.Central point is the mutual plan of an insurance rep and the wife of a rich husband to commit the perfect crime and literally get away with murder. Said salesman Walter Neff (Fred McMurray) not only commits the crime, but is also supposed to investigate it along with insurance inspector and friend Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). Reluctantly but inevitably he stumbles into his own demise, which he is unfortunate to experience from either side of the law. What makes this dark existential dilemma so exciting is not so much what happens but how it is presented to the viewer and how the components fit together to form a supreme whole. Thanks primarily to an amazing script and aided by Wilder's flawless direction that leaves nothing to desire for a film noir devotee the film indeed lives up to the expectations of its promise and has since become an invaluable reference. Aside from McMurray and the terrific Robinson there's also Barbara Stanwyck playing the ensnaring femme fatale, and all of them deliver sharp dialog. Add to that high-contrast black and white cinematography, effective lighting, multiple Oscars winner Miklós Rózsa's score - all the best ingredients for a touchstone of film noir experience, complete with fatality drive. Classic."
jmstein,"Mar 17, 2004",7/10,"A classic from 1944 still holds up despite some campy 40's dialogue.  Dark lighting and shading sets the mood and a convoluted plot sucks you in immediately.Love Wilder's direction and was interesting to see McMurray in a much different type of role than we are most used to seeing him in.I don't see Stanwyck as a sex symbol and McMurray is burdened with some very dated dialogue but the characters are still interesting.  Edward G. Robinson is excellent as Keyes, a very interesting and underrated character in the film.I gave the film a 7 and easily could have given it a 7.5, I can see why it received multiple Academy Award Nominations."
paul2001sw-1,"Oct 24, 2015",6/10,"'Double Indemnity' is a tale of an insurance salesman who fancies he can engineer the perfect crime but who doesn't reckon on others being more ruthless than himself. It features a script by Raymond Chandler, and direction by Billy Wilder: you couldn't get much better than this in the 1940s. In it's favour, it's nicely paced with some sharp wise-cracking dialogue, and Edward G. Robinson is fun in a supporting role. Against that, it rather leads its audience by the nose, with a voice-over telling where it would have been better to simply show. This puts a distance between us and the film, which doesn't spoil the tricksy plotting but which does rather kill the movie's emotional dimension. For sure, it feels its age; but the film's redeeming virtue is in its genuine interest in telling its story, something you feel more modern films, art-house and blockbuster alike, often seem to lack."
Tobeshadow,"Nov 17, 2021",10/10,"A sumptuous black and white banquet for the senses, Double Indemnity oozes with sexiness and class at every turn with Billy Wilder's masterful direction taking centre frame. Every shot is beautifully constructed, and the story pushes the taboos of the time in ingenious ways. This is when being 'subversive' in cinema really meant something and when true craftsmen could slip things past the censor's ever watchful eye.The dialogue in the film is wonderful, from the snappy back and forth between the leads to the classic noir narration and there's a terrific blend of tension cut with wry humour throughout. It's also a fascinating portrait of an affluent 1940s America, a far cry from the war-torn Europe of the time.The Noir classic, and among the finest films ever made!"
gavin6942,"Feb 26, 2010",9/10,"An insurance agent and a young woman scheme up a way to kill the woman's husband and stage it as an accident, cashing in on the man's insurance (which he did not even know he had, due to a forged signature). But the woman may have other ideas in mind after the agent is no longer useful.This is my first official journey into film noir (although how exactly this is defined is unknown to me) and my first journey into the world of director Billy Wilder. If this is typical Wilder, I'm very excited for my next journey, ""Sunset Boulevard"". From the opening credits with the man on crutches to the closing scene, the narrative was presented in a gripping, suspenseful fashion...I'm not sure if I like Barbara Stanwyck as a blond. I love Babs with all my heart, but blonds? Not for me. Edward G. Robinson is the perfect film noir man with his distinguished look and the way hats and suits just fit him... he gives a wonderful lecture comparing a desk job to that of a surgeon and pencils to scalpels and another great rant about all the suicide stats and kinds of poisons used. I wish I could recreate them here in his signature voice. (This same year, 1944, he made ""The Woman in the Window"" -- another great tale.) I feel bad this review is so short... truly, this is one of the best films I've seen this year, and if you're into that old time film, you should see this! Now!"

ScorpioVelvet,"Jun 9, 2016",10/10,"I've finally watched this today for the first time, and I was really surprised by how flawless this classic noir was made. Talk about great acting and entertaining story-line - Billy Wilder was on the road to Hollywood greatness before making his Academy Award-winning The Lost Weekend (1945) a year later. Although the film was based on a novel, the film is told in flashbacks as a salesman falls for a mistress for which he becomes involved with murdering her husband and pretend if it he was killed in an accident. Barbara Stanwyck makes quite a beautiful impression while Fred MacMurray brilliantly portrays in a main dramatic role and Edward G. Robinson also joins in the mystery. There is lot of neatly-crafted camera-work and a memorable musical score to make it enough to be an instant masterpiece of the genre, and cannot ever forget to mention great mystery writer Raymond Chandler co-wrote the screenplay with Wilder as well. In other words overall, this is my new most favorite effort from Wilder after seeing some of his well-known works for over a decade now.My Rating: 5/5"
BA_Harrison,"Aug 4, 2019",9/10,"A 'double indemnity' is a clause on an insurance policy that pays out double under certain circumstances. In the case of this stylish noir from director Billy Wilder, it's on the accident insurance taken out by Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck) for her unaware husband, the lady cashing in big should her old man die on a train. With the help of obliging insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), Phyllis does away with her hubbie, but her plans to collect $100k go awry when claims investigator Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson) becomes involved.I'm no expert on film noir, having merely dipped my toes into the murky world of murder, mystery, deceit, intrigue and betrayal, but Double Indemnity has surely got to be the gold standard of the genre. The screenplay, co-written by Wilder and Raymond Chandler, is brimming with sexual tension, atmosphere, and snappy dialogue. The three central performances are superb - a classic femme fatale in the form of Stanwyck, MacMurray as the fast-talking schmo who lets a good looking dame twist him round her little finger, and Robinson as the relentless, analytical fly-in-the-ointment. Wilder directs with his usual aplomb and the black and white cinematography is excellent.While the viewer might guess that things are going to go badly from the outset (after all, there is no such thing as the perfect murder), a large part of the enjoyment is in seeing how Phyllis and Walter act under pressure, desperately trying to find a way out as their carefully considered plans slowly crumble. The formula worked so well that it was used again for the steamy '80s neo-noir Body Heat, starring scheming seductress Kathleen Turner, but as much as I enjoy seeing Turner all hot and sweaty, Double Indemnity's coolness gives it the edge."
Prince-P,"Dec 20, 2022",6/10,"James Cain's novella ""Double Indemnity"" was published in Liberty Magazine in February 1935. A few days later four major Hollywood studios contacted the author. MGM, Warners, Fox and Paramount all wanted to turn the yarn into a film. But there was a snag. The mighty Hays Office, which in practice decided what movies the companies could make, said no. The story was considered too grim.In the film a young, naive salesman is seduced by one of his clients' wives. Together they take out life insurance on her aging husband. Then they plan to kill the man to collect the indemnity.Eight years later, Paramount decided to try to film ""Double Indemnity"" again. Director Billy Wilder was asked to rewrite the material to appease the Hays Office. And together with author Raymond Chandler, the director set to work. But unfortunately problems immediately arose. Billy Wilder hated that Raymond Chandler constantly smoked his smelly old pipe in their small study. He also couldn't stand that the alcoholic writer drank large amounts of whiskey while working.If there were problems in the script department, things worked better in front of the cameras. Wilder managed to find three actors who gave some of their best performances in his movie. Barbara Stanwyck was the very prototype of a sleazy, film-noir femme fatale, Fred MacMurray, who usually did comedies, played patsy and Edward G Robinson stepped forward as a first-rate character actor.Sadly, the efforts by the actors couldn't save ""Double Indemnity"" at the box office. World War ll was raging, and cinema audiences preferred happier stories on the big screen. It would be many years before the film was reevaluated and given its rightful place among Billy Wilder's major works. But by then the director himself had moved on and made ""The Lost Weekend"". Ironically, a film about an alcoholic writer."
jameslinton-75252,"May 14, 2016",6/10,"This was another difficult film for me to review. Stylistically it is very strong. It is easy to see why it is regarded as a classic in its genre. The black-and-white filter makes the film dramatic and tense. I also really liked how the film is narrated by the protagonist. This added an energy to the film and made it engaging to watch. This notwithstanding, Double Indemnity wasn't perfect. The romance between the two lead characters felt forced and the film didn't engage me throughout. I was bored at times. If you're looking for a classic noir film then this is the one for you.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/XBX7ow"
Lejink,"Sep 28, 2011",9/10,"Another of my dad's favourite films and was he ever right. Along with that other celebrated James M Cain adaptation ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", this particular cocktail of sex, murder and intrigue becomes the cinematic equivalent of a page-turning thriller as workaday insurance salesman Fred McMurray falls hard for Barbara Stanwyck's anklet and soon afterwards the rest of her so that before he knows it he's ankle-deep in a murderous plot that will have catastrophic consequences for them both.Of course the film could hardly go wrong with Wilder himself and Chandler adapting Cain's novel, Wilder behind the camera and Edward G and Ms Stanwyck in lead roles but it's Mr Family Guy McMurray who's the real revelation, giving the performance of his life as the wise-guy sucker taken for a ride by femme-fatale Stanwyck.There's constant exposition in the screenplay as McMurray's Walter Neff flashbacks us through the preceding events and Robinson exercises his ""little man inside"" to crack the case in progress, but you hardly notice it, you're so gripped by the plot. The dialogue is sharper than a buzz-saw, particularly the first encounter between McMurray and Stanwyck where you can almost see the flames crackling into life between them while Wilder's direction keeps up the suspense from first to last and yet is never unnecessarily hurried.As to which is the better movie between this and ""Postman"" it's the difference between a twenty and two tens. Essential Golden Age Hollywood film-making, murderously good."
mmallon4,"Mar 27, 2015",10/10,"If there is a keyword I would describe Double Indemnity, its dialogue. Exposition is a very tricky line to cross; when done poorly it can come off as immensely frustrating but when done right it can be music to the ears, leaving me dying to hear more like I'm watching an engrossing documentary. Throughout Double Indemnity with the use of narration, Fred MacMurray will explain what's clearly appearing in the frame but as nobody does narration quite like Billy Wilder. Instead of making Double Indemnity coming off as a movie which feels the need to dumb down and explain everything to the viewer, this expositional narration comes off a poetry, enhancing any scene in the film. Even with hearing noir dialogue parodied countless times, it doesn't affect my enjoyment of the movie.I've generally never thought much of Fred MacMurray as an actor; he strikes me as serviceable but never an enigmatic screen presence. His role as Walter Neff in Double Indemnity is the one major exception in his career. This casting against type may be my favourite one-hit wonder performance ever; his uttering of the words ""Baby"" and ""Hello Keyes"" never gets old. When I first watched Double Indemnity I assumed MacMurray must have been an icon of film noir, turns out he was anything but. Barbara Stanwyck was a sexual siren in a number of her films, I'm not aware of what Stanwyck's ideological or moral beliefs where but a number of her films are some of most sexually suggestive old Hollywood films I've seen. There is her pre-code work such as Baby Face but in the postcode era, she appeared in the code breakers Ball of Fire, The Lady Eve and yes, Double Indemnity. In her introduction scene as Phyllis Dietrichson, she is dressed in a titillating manner with her legs crossed while wearing a skirt, almost expecting her to pull off a Sharon Stone in Basic Instinct. Culminating this trio of actors at some of their greatest work is Edward G. Robinson as Barton Keyes, the claims expert. When watching his performance I don't feel like I'm watching someone playing a claims expert, I feel like I'm watching an actual claims expert. Double Indemnity offers an intriguing insight into the profession of the insurance salesman but like being a lawyer, I'm sure this is one job which Hollywood makes out to be more exciting than it actually is.Like a number of films in the noir genre, the ending is revealed at the beginning of the movie, leaving me not wanting to know how the film ends but rather how the story and characters got to that point and boy, am I dying to know. For an example of one of the film's suspenseful scenes, take the moment in which Phyllis arrives at Walter's apartment to discover Keyes is also there. All within a single frame Phyllis is hiding behind the door with Walter trying to prop it open and Keyes in the background. When Keyes walks towards the door and there is a bump in the music score, it's moments like these which get the blood rushing, yet they look so deceptively simple.Why do Phyllis and Walter agree that honking a car horn three times a signal when that would easily draw attention? When a plot hole or nonsensical moment (Or Barbara Stanwyck's wig) doesn't bother me in the slightest, it's a testament to how great a movie is: not affecting the movie's heart racing, tearing the leather of the sofa's armrest levels of suspense from start to finish. Why are so many people dismissive of old movies? Because they are corny and cheesy? Few other movies pose such an aurora of cool as Double Indemnity, baby!"
cosmicscale,"Dec 2, 2018",10/10,"History is an important part of grasping any sense of perspective towards the future, thus to learn about forward, you must first look to study backwards, if you want to learn about higher dimensions, you must understand the lower frequencies of dimensional space, to get a relative sense of the formulation that runs infinitely through this universe. In this time there were not a lot of authenticate real scripts, definitely in film-noir. other than a select good few, which eb and flow through great vasodilation in modern day, in even the more worse scripts, there is an ever lasting sense of realism now, a more natural caution of portraying events, it is through years of developing our movie screen production abilities, that we grow, with any organizational organism, comes evolution. Double Indemnity's passionately, devious script, along with its excellent pace, and extraordinary dialogue, not only gives you a real sense of the lingo for that time, but it also shows Billy Wilder's early directorial talent, not to mention you'll forget your watching a movie in a 1:37:1 screen ration format, its that good. Fred Macmurry, and Barbara Stanwycks synergism is fabulously right next to Humprey Bogart's and Lauren Bacall's, during that time. It really shows the abysmal abyss, that ones consciousness can extend to the depths of. This movie gives you a pace, and perspective of thrill, and utmost sympathy, throughout the whole movie, no matter whom your rooting for in this one, you sure will not be upset. You absolutely cannot go wrong with this one, it is in my personal all time top three best films ever made, this is a type of movie, that will make you think about it for days, almost obsessively, it is a type of film that will make you go out and buy its poster. I would have loved to live in this time just to see this film in the theaters, with the 40s-50s film-noir atmosphere roaming about. Through my journey of studying film at school, and threw my endless search on my own just threw traveling the long illustrious roads of imdb's(/internet's) syntactic pages of delightful synergistic tranquility, I would effortlessly say that this movie stands at a solid 9.7/10, and that is being, forcing myself not to just give it a 10. If you like film-noir, be ready to fall in love. (9.7/10)(legitimately) (11/10 if you like film-noir.) -Koree"
FilmOtaku,"Jul 11, 2005",8/10,"The plan is devious, but a simple one. In an effort to rid herself of her allegedly abusive ex-husband, a woman strikes up a romance with an insurance salesman who just happens upon her doorstep with some auto insurance renewals. Since it's not enough to get out of her marriage without financial security, she enlists the salesman to not only commit fraud by having the cuckolded husband sign a life insurance policy with a double indemnity clause without any knowledge of doing so, but also to help her bump off her husband by making it look like an accident. Unfortunately, paranoia and conscience tends to get in the way in situations like these, and even something that seems to be a ""perfect murder"" can go sour, fast. This is the plot of Billy Wilder's celebrated 1944 noir masterpiece, ""Double Indemnity"", in which Phyllis Dietrichson (Stanwyck) and Walter Neff (MacMurray) find themselves embroiled in a situation that at the time, seemed like a good one, until they end up way over their heads; mainly due to their lack of trust in each other. Rounding out the cast is Edward G. Robinson, who plays Barton Keyes, Walter's friend and co-worker at the insurance company, a man who is on the trail of the murder plot due to his position as the manager of claims.""Double Indemnity"" has been hailed as one of the best, if not the best, of the film noir genre. It is such a dark film, both in plot and aesthetically, that it is sometimes easy to forget that Billy Wilder didn't just direct romantic comedies like ""Some Like it Hot"", ""The Seven Year Itch"" and ""Sabrina"". Particularly in his earlier filmography, we see wonderful dark films mixed in with the fanciful, like this one and ""The Lost Weekend"". Dimly lit, with wonderful shadows and people hiding behind dark glasses and behind doors and corners, ""Double Indemnity"", while not the first film in the noir genre, certainly is one that defines it. Wilder's direction is brilliant, particularly the machine-gun pacing of both the action and the dialogue. The screenplay in particular is inspired, as the rapid-fire dialogue between characters is spewed as fast as one can process it. Lines like, ""Do I laugh now, or wait until it gets funny?"" or ""How could I have known that murder could sometimes smell like honeysuckle?"" or my personal favorite exchange between Phyllis and Walter: Phyllis: ""I wonder if I know what you mean?"" Walter: ""I wonder if you wonder"" are so deliciously classic that it's difficult not to enjoy every one of them.I cannot picture any other actors in their roles than MacMurray, Stanwyck and Robinson. Stanwyck, at this point a legend in cinema already, had previously worked with Wilder on the screwball comedy ""Ball of Fire"" with Gary Cooper, but despite their comedic history, Wilder had the foresight to cast her. Fred MacMurray is so typecast as Steve Douglas in the television show ""My Three Sons"" and as the ""Absent-Minded Professor"" in a series of Disney films, that no matter how prepared one is to see him in this film, personally I can't help but chuckle the first time he is on screen. His casting was certainly inspired though; a quick glance through his filmography does not show any kind of break out role prior to this one. The heat between the two of them is very present, but more importantly, they are able to convey the more subtle emotions of paranoia and fear of one another with one single glance. Edward G. Robinson, always a great actor, is superb as Keyes. One thing that he has always managed to do, despite (or maybe because of) his less than matinée-idol looks, is to play a strong character that still comes across as emotional and human. Even after he eventually figures out that his protégée may not be what he thought he was, he still exhibits an almost fatherly concern for Walter.Personally, of all the many films I have seen in the film noir genre, ""Double Indemnity"" is not my favorite; Otto Preminger's ""Laura"", released the same year, is superior, in my opinion. However, the beauty of ""Double Indemnity"" is that it is so thoroughly compelling, so entertaining and so well made that despite its miniscule shortcomings (like Stanwyck's terrible wig) it is a film that, although it is one of several hundred films of its kind, it contains the mainstream appeal to define the genre. If somehow you have not seen this film - maybe you've been under a rock, perhaps you see a black and white film and instead of it creating a Pavlovian response of salivating like it does for me, you run screaming  whatever the reason, check it out; you're missing a great film. 8/10 --Shelly"
ABigHat,"Feb 26, 2023",7/10,"On nearly every list that I can find, Double Indemnity is near or sometimes the top of the 'Best Noir Films' of all time. It has everything. It uses the black and white and the shadows thereof to perfection. It has possibly the best femme fatale ever on screen. Edward G. Robinson puts on his best performance. And Neff is a beautiful protagonist with complexity and depth.Despite all that. For my money. It's VERY good... not great. The Third Man and The Big Sleep were shot better. We didn't get enough of Barbara Stanwyck. I still can't poke any holes in Edward G's performance. But MacMurray offered very little charisma. For a character written so that we must cheer for him, in the hands of another actor we'd fall in love with him a la Sam Spade.A wonderful movie, worth everyone's time but possibly not all of the accolades it gets."
Boba_Fett1138,"Mar 25, 2009",9/10,"This is a classic movie that is made by its story. It has a great deep murder-plot, with normal characters being put in not so normal circumstances. Within its genre this is simply one fine movie, that with all of its ingredients embodies the crime/film-noir genre of the '40's.Like all of these movies it begins all rather simple, with a good thought out murder-plot but of course soon things start to go from bad to worse. This is what I like mostly about this type of movies. Characterers change throughout the movie and the plot thickens fast. It's really a movie that gets better by the minute and besides also features plenty of nice twists and developments. A real fine constructed movie.It's of course also being made great by it's atmosphere, that I don't consider typically film-noir like, cinematography and directing by Billy Wilder, who handled a lot of different genres successfully throughout his career, film-noir being just one of them. He also helped to write the screenplay for this movie. His directing and writing both earned him an Oscar nomination for this movie. The movie got nominated for a total of 7 Oscar's, including best picture but it won none however. Nevertheless the movie has grown out to be more of a classic than the movies that did won an Oscar over ""Double Indemnity"" that year.Fred MacMurray isn't really the best known actor but he suits his role in this movie just fine. He really fits in well within the genre. I wasn't too happy about Barbara Stanwyck though, who has played far better roles throughout her career. She also looked quite ridicules with her blond wig. Ironically enough she still got nominated for an Oscar for her role in this movie. It was great to see Edward G. Robinson in this. It was the first time ever he appeared in a film-noir and prior to this he was mostly known for his tough roles in gangster-movies.A must-see for the fans of the genre.9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
t-murphy-94619,"Dec 17, 2015",10/10,"Double Indemnity is a true spectacle. It handles every aspect of film making perfectly. The dark lighting illuminating everything bet the character in question heightens suspense. Never showing the murder take place doesn't take away from the impact because Barbara Stanwyck's blank, emotionless expression gives even more of an impact. Edward G. Robinson shines as Barton Keyes. His abrasive yet respectable candor is played incredibly well. Your stomach drops at points when the culprits plan may be uncovered and your heart skips beat when the two perpetrators may be caught. But what really ties this film together is the friendship of Walter Neff(Fred MacMurray) and Barton Keyes which is torn in such a pitiable way."

alexanderlavin,"Feb 27, 2025",10/10,"This is the one, the tip of the iceberg, the film noir par excellence, the one that you can't turn off once it's on. Everybody loves it, since forever, so there's nothing left to say, but let me say this...There may be darker films noir, there may be sexier ones, there may be ones with more entertaining plot mechanics, there may be ones with more desperate heroes, there may be ones that more embody the postwar anxiety. This one, though, hangs all of those things in perfect balance for the viewer's pleasure, better even than *The Big Sleep* and *Out of the Past* do.What stays with me is the musicality of its rhythms, the biting Wilder humor from a perfectly cast Robinson, the odd rootlessness of its characters, and that unshakeable fatalism of it all."
ill_behavior,"Feb 17, 2005",9/10,"This is the film most noirs are judged by. It has a wonderful cast, but they are helped immeasurably by the script. Raymod Chandler was evidently firing on all cylinders when he wrote it, the dialogue sparkles, it really is sharp stuff. You couldn't get this is any other genre, and there's no other words to describe what goes on other than ""hard boiled"". It's tough stuff, and it's an amazing film.Essentially we have an insurance salesman here getting embroiled in a sticky situation with a beautiful blonde femme fatale. It goes awry, needless to say, with Eddie G Robinson pulling the strings as an amazing support character, he gives one of his best performances here in my opinion, although the two leads have such magnetic screen presence not one scene in the film drags.If you like this, I recommend Earnest Hemmingway's The Killers, another classic.But this is the daddy, Double Indemnity is well worth they hype."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 24, 2010",10/10,"I have not read the book or anything concerning the original case, and this is the only version that I've watched. If the novel is this spellbinding, I may have to get a copy. I suppose I should address something before I get into the review itself; yes, the story is quite similar to The Postman Always Rings Twice(and while this is superior, I would definitely suggest giving that one a whirl, too... the original, that is). It's the same author, and they aren't identical. They are also both somewhat reminiscent of Macbeth. Other than that I did not find myself falling in love with these leads(as I did in the Garfield/Turner one), I really cannot complain about this film(and I won't even attempt to argue against the immense chemistry that this duo has; they light the screen on fire). I have not seen a lot of Wilder's work, but I thoroughly enjoyed Some Like It Hot, as well. This is a classic piece of noir, and ought to get a viewing by every fan of such. The brilliant dialog and narration is full of metaphors, plays on words(and the like) and every line is carefully phrased, with several utterly unforgettable exchanges. Editing and cinematography are excellent. The lighting and use of shadows... incredible. This does an amazing job of building suspense and tension. The plot is well-written, and the twists are impeccable. Every acting performance is spot-on. The characters are credible and well-developed, and the women are allowed strong-willed moments. MacMurray is rather cool. There is a little racism and sexism(on account of when it was made), some innuendo and brief mild and not graphic violence in this. I recommend this to everyone into these movies. 10/10"
ksf-2,"Apr 4, 2004",10/10,"Barbara Stanwyck (multi bw movies ""Lady Eve"", many others) and Fred MacMurray (also many bw movies, then the dad on My Three Sons TV series) meet as an insurance salesman attempts to sell an insurance policy to a California housewife. They both play dark, sinister roles, unlike what they are both known for. I love the playful banter as they flirt and tease each other before things get more serious. Plot also has several clever twists, and the viewer squirms several times when the investigators almost catch people in compromising positions in a Hitchcock manner. Edward Robinson is MacMurray's boss helping to track down the clues. Billy Wilder directed. Movie was remade later in 1973 with richard crenna, but stick with the old b/w version."
zetes,"Mar 20, 2000",8/10,"Sorry, but I have a problem taking the Absent Minded Professor/The Shaggy D.A. seriously. I think Fred is not a very good actor. I saw this in a film noir class, and I think that this was probably the least good of all the films we watched (though I would still give it an 8/10). There are many better noirs, especially The Maltese Falcon, Out of the Past, and Kiss Me Deadly. Plus, the novella on which this film is based is much, much more complex and just plain better. I read it before I saw the film. I was blown away by the novella, but only moderately impressed (mostly at Barbara Stanwyck) with the film."
SonOfMoog,"Dec 5, 2006",9/10,"The difference between a film noir and a mystery is that in a mystery everyone wonders who did it; in a film noir, everyone knows. The difference between a film noir and a caper flick is that in a caper flick what commands our attention is the details of the crime; in a film noir, things don't get interesting until after the crime.Here in Double Indemnity two rotten people conspire to commit murder. ""We're both rotten,"" she says. ""You're a little more rotten,"" he replies. Not that it matters, which of them is worse. It is their fundamental character that moves them to plan the crime, and energizes them to go through with it. And, it is their lack of character which proves their undoing.The murder weighs on them as the investigation proceeds, and they live in fear of being found out. Not only are they being trailed by a canny insurance investigator, who slowly unravels the crime, but they cannot be together for fear of arousing suspicion. And, suspicion is exactly what gets aroused. Walter and Phyllis begin to suspect each other, begin to conspire to implicate each other, creating a different kind of insurance policy, one that would allow each to escape from the plot they had hatched, leaving the other to take the fall. Here .. here is where Double Indemnity earns its reputation as a masterpiece: we see the emotional consequences of a deed so terrible, neither guilty party can live with it, and we live inside their heads and hearts as their well-laid plans and dreams for happiness turn to dust at their feet. I don't remember any movie where the tormented inner psyche of two persons is more clearly seen than here.Finally, in the piece de resistance we learn just what Walter and Phyllis are really capable of in the best scene of the movie at the Dietrichson home, where Walter goes to tell Phyllis he's leaving. We see their fear, deceit, distrust, anxiety, and pain all come to the surface and explode in what is the ultimate solution in every noir predicament: gunfire. It's difficult in some respects to talk about this movie, because it is so tightly plotted. Unlike many noir masterpieces, like Out of the Past, for example, all the complex plot points tie together into a cohesive whole. I'm tempted to want to summarize those points, to show why Phyllis and Walter became so frightened, but watching their schemes come undone a point at a time is what creates this movie's tension, and it's something that should be experienced, not analyzed.I should close with a footnote about Barbara Stanwyck. She wears a wig throughout this picture that some think looks terrible. Billy Wilder himself said it looked terrible. Some people think she didn't have the looks to pull off a role as an alluring, manipulative femme fatale. She sold me. To take another quote from a completely different context: she had me at hello. I had no problem believing that men would kill for this woman.If you're reading this and have never seen Double Indemnity, see it and marvel at its many superiorities to movies of today. It is a masterpiece, and a solid 9 out of 10."
AaronCapenBanner,"Nov 6, 2013",7/10,"Billy Wilder directed this early film noir that stars Fred MacMurray as insurance salesman Walter Neff, who one day meets the wife of one of his clients, a Mr. Dietrichson. His wife Phyllis(played by Barbara Stanwyck) is a devious woman who convinces Walter to join her in a plot to kill her husband for the insurance money. Walter has the idea of making it a double indemnity policy which will pay out twice the amount for accidental death. After they arrange his murder, Insurance investigator Barton Keyes(played by Edward G. Robinson) becomes suspicious of Phyllis, and thinks she arranged the death with another man, not knowing it is his friend Walter... Well directed and written mystery with Robinson stealing the picture with his crafty performance(an early version of ""Columbo"") Indeed, his is the only character you can root for...the lead characters get what they deserve!"
mchl88,"May 2, 2024",9/10,"I'm not a film noir connoisseur (say that three times fast) but for my money this is the quintessential film of the genre.It's got all the elements: overly dramatic dialogue, tons of shadows, of course in black and white, a diabolical plot that features a coupla double crosses, and plenty of dames.There's a scene halfway through this movie where the wife and the insurance guy commit the murder at the heart of this movie. When they attempt to escape her car doesn't start right away. She can't get it to turn over. And the viewer finds themselves wanting it to start. I yelled at the screen, ""C'mon, start the car!"" That moment, IMO is the sign of a great film. Because I shouldn't be rooting for these people. They're murderers and they just killed an innocent man for money. But we do. We want them to escape. And that's great storytelling. Getting the viewer on the side of evil without them even realizing it takes a ton of talent.9 out of 10 stars for me on this one. I can watch it time and time again and love it even more with each viewing."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 7, 2012",10/10,"While watching Billy Wilder's ""Double Indemnity"", I quickly figured out that it has a plot similar to that of ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"" (which makes sense, since James M. Cain wrote both of them). But the similarity doesn't at all subtract from this story of an insurance salesman (Fred MacMurray) who conspires with an unhappy wife (Barbara Stanwyck) to murder her husband. The seedy environs of 1930s Los Angeles combine with Stanwyck's ability to practically breathe sexiness to make a perfect movie. Probably the most interesting role goes to Edward G. Robinson, playing a claims adjuster who looks for phony claims. I've been used to seeing him play gangsters, and here he's the character who just might throw a wrench into the main characters' plan.One of the most effective scenes is when Stanwyck's character first appears and then descends the staircase. The camera angle tells as much as words do. It's just one of many things that make this a perfect movie. All involved had every reason to be proud of it."
sandnair87,"Aug 26, 2015",9/10,"Billy Wilder's Double Indemnity doesn't really try to make us care about its protagonists, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray making a great chump) and femme fatale Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck's finest hour). Hell, the film itself hardly cares about them! We learn the score from the get-go, when Walter recites his confession into a Dictaphone: ""I killed him for money and for a woman. I didn't get the money, and I didn't get the woman."" So much for last-act revelations! But that's fine: any loss of suspense is more than compensated for by the thrills we encounter on the twisting road to his demise.The film then goes into a flashback. When Walter turns up at the Dietrichson home to discuss the renewal on Mr. Dietrichson's auto insurance, he takes an immediate shine to the coquettish, anklet-wearing Phyllis. The chillingly amoral Phyllis, motivated by little more than boredom, makes no secret about her loveless marriage to an older man, and how much she'd like to see her husband get insured heavily - and then die. Walter, having fallen in love hook, line, and sinker, tells Phyllis that that if the husband has an accidental-death insurance policy with a double-indemnity clause, Phyllis (and, by extension, Walter) stands to get some serious coin and since he knows the business inside and out, he can stage a foolproof murder. All seems to be going according to plan, until the salesman's shrewd boss Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson, in a wonderful rat-a-tat performance) begins to smell a scam. As the screws tighten on Walter, he starts to realize just how devious Phyllis can be and over the next hour and a half, we are irresistibly drawn into the drama that ensnares them all.Film noir is the most intoxicating of Hollywood cocktails, and none is more potent than Double Indemnity. Billy Wilder breaks the rules of filmmaking with breathtaking confidence and is all the more satisfying for it. It has all the hallmarks of film noir – it's a moody, pessimistic crime story with strong overtones of spiritual bankruptcy and moral cynicism. Like the best of film noir, it sizzles with crackling, sardonic dialogue (watching Neff and Phyllis interact belies the twisted beauty of the film), veiled lust, overtones of impending doom and a seductively devious femme fatale. And the brooding look of the film is magnificent – the City of Angels, haunted throughout by human weakness and greed, somehow appearing dark even when the sun's shining.Double Indemnity is a splendidly chilling noir about murder, immorality, lust, and greed - both a starkly realistic and a carefully stylized masterpiece of murder!"
allamericanpsycho21,"Oct 15, 2007",9/10,"I must admit that I am a somewhat novice when it comes to the genre of film noir. As a film student, I've heard the term thrown around before but, with the exception of the film L.A. Confidential, I haven't had very much exposure to the genre. Based on my first viewing of Double Indemnity, it definitely seems like a genre that I would like to get more familiar with.The most intriguing part of Double Indemnity was the way that it gently toyed with the audience by giving them a satisfying but original non-Hollywood style ending. Based on Hollywood films of today, it's pretty easy to see how Double Indemnity would be remade today. Walter and Phyllis would steal the money, end up together, and the final shot of the film would probably be them sipping margaritas as they talk about how they fooled the world (a'la Swordfish or Wild Things).If Hollywood were to do a remake of this film noir classic, I'd be willing to bet it would be a bastardized version as they have done so many times before. Remember the Casablanca inspired Barb Wire? Sadly, I do.Thankfully, there is no bastardization of the novel that accrues in this adaptation. There is no happy ending for anyone. Walter Ness sealed his fate the moment he agreed to help Phyllis with her deceptive con. This is a story of without heroes and without villains, everyone has faults and everyone has flaws. I say bravo to Billy Wilder for creating a film that stands with test of time with characters that are something unlike anything in films today. They are human, not merely devises for carrying on a mechanical plot."
qprfan_scott,"Jul 4, 2000",9/10,"For someone born nearly forty years after this film to enjoy it, means it must be good. And it is. Fred MacMurray and Edward G. Robinson are both brilliant in this film and the storyline is well written and well executed."

Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Apr 19, 2009",8/10,"""Double Indemnity"" in a modern context seems remarkably unoriginal. An unhappy but wealthy housewife and her insurance salesman lover plot to scam and murder her husband to collect $100,000 on a double indemnity clause in his life insurance. But the film is a darkly lit, chain-smoking bona-fide film noir thriller, an execution of incredible suspense and style with dialog and narration that you just don't hear in film anymore. It's unflinchingly nostalgic, like an ageless perfume -- often mimicked, but still distinct.The structure of the story offers more of its originality. It opens with the main character, insurance salesman Walter Neff (Fred MacMurray), confessing a murder into the voice recording cylinder of his boss. It's a murder mystery told in hindsight, flaunting its mastery by managing to be suspenseful in Neff's retelling despite having revealed the end result. Though it takes awhile to get rolling, the film has you hooked and dying to know how it all went down.Neff's narrative gives the film its noir tone. Previously a romantic comedy actor, MacMurray absolutely nails the persona and voice of ""it was a dark and stormy night."" His ability to light matches with one hand is a party trick that even today's ardent opposers of secondhand smoke would kill to know. His transition from slick, smooth-talking salesman to paranoid killer is the film's strongest plot arc.Billy Wilder writes and directs a film that flows surprisingly well. It's very clear what's going on and each scene takes time to set itself up and set a specific mood that he echoes with lighting. Scenes in front of windows or in doorways are a favorite of his in the film.""Double Indemnity"" is one of the earliest examples of movies depicting the downfall of the small-time criminal who can't easily look past or forgive his/her own actions. 65 years later, this message has been diluted by many more films that echo it in more complex and intriguing ways. If you don't absolutely love this film, you probably love a film that borrows at least some element from this richly rooted classic."
gigan-92,"Sep 29, 2011",10/10,"Film noir is often both mystery and tragedy intertwined as a single genre. It was a one of a kind film experience, one that has remained an undeniable classic for some time. Though elements of film noir have been duplicated from time to time in modern films, such as Sin City and the animated film Batman: Mask of the Phantasm, the original films are simply a band apart. Film noir most specifically represented a time of change in American history. At a time when World War II was awakening people to the horrors men were capable of, and the perfect picture was that of that of the suburban family, film noir was almost a shadow cast by those things. The genre was an exposure of the blackness of the human soul. Housewives and insurance salesman, ordinary people that committed heinous crimes for the hunger of sex and money, not uncommonly both. Not to mention due to the censorship code being in full effect, the writers and filmmakers had to be subtle about their subject, and what it lead to was sharp characterization that didn't use just words. All of these aspects come together to form the mise en scene of Double Indemnity.Consider the cast: Fred MacMurray as Walter Neff was a promising choice from the start. After all, prior to this role MacMurray had done light-hearted comedies, and the same went for after the role. The character of Walter Neff was obviously a lot darker than anything he'd portrayed before in his career, and to audiences it must of seemed very cold and unfamiliar to see him play the part as well as he did. The audience first meets MacMurray's character Neff as a confident and cool salesman, completely in control of his little world, till that is he meets the character of Phyllis Dietrichson, played by the luscious Barbara Stanwyck.Stanwyck is the temptress, a model example of the film noir femme fatale. Of course one of the fundamental key components of the film is the relationship between Stanwyck's character and MacMurray's. Right when they first meet, a low angle shot reveals to him a smooth-skinned angel, eyes glistening and all. We see him on the other hand from a low angle, before anyone even realizing that the cinematography is establishing the nature of their relations. The femme fatale was many things, a seductress, a siren, but to be more exact one might say bluntly a wolf in sheep's clothing.Edward G. Robinson is more of a character actor this time around, playing Robert Keyes. He is not only a friend of Neff, but he is the incorruptible 'detective' of the film. Even though he's just a claims man, it is made evidently clear he's somewhat of a protagonist. I use the word somewhat because throughout the film he inadvertently puts heat on MacMurray, saying ""A claims man is a surgeon. That desk is an operating table, and the pencils are scalpels and bone chisels"". It is subtly symbolized that the occupation is a breeding ground of human treachery, for when Keyes refers to the claims themselves that he receives every day, he remarks ""they're packed with drama; with twisted hopes and crooked dreams."" Another powerful film noir component is the nature of the story. While ach one obviously varies, at the root of all film noir is the temptation of money and so-called love, full of people who will literally kill for those things. The nature of the screenplay captures the dark side of the human nature perfectly. Notice how Barbara Stanwyck creates the mood of vulnerability, using it to deceive Walter. He at first seems to be weary, but he shot of their first kiss already sets up his inability to resist. The low key lighting helps to enhance this dark mood. Foolish Walter eventually does take the vile deed upon himself to orchestrate, and composer Miklós Rózsa adds a dark cue as he takes on the sinful task.The consistent hard lightning returns as Neff walks down the street, and tells the audience ""It was the walk of a dead man."" The film opens up with his character confessing, so already it is known who has committed the crime, and yet as the climax draws closer more and more of the plan begins to fall thru, and one can feel a sense of disaster ahead.A combination of hard and low-key lightning adds greatly to the film, all of it used to heighten the character's emotions. Coupled with MacMurray's cynical narration, the effect is quite devastating. Remember the brightly lit outdoors of the peaceful suburb neighborhood in the opening scenes, where we even see innocent children running and playing. Once Walter enters the house, however, he finds himself in a gloomy otherworld, one from which he will not be able to escape. The ever present Venetians blinds cast prison bars on Walter in many scenes. This fusion of lightning and subtle symmetry set up the doomed aura surrounding Walter.Note the tight framing at first with the two 'lovers', but by half-way thru the film much looser framing is used as the two's trust diminishes with every exposed lie. It is in their final moments together the spacing becomes tighter for one last moment of intimacy. The final scene between the two is both a landmark for its music, or lack there of, and its visuals. There in that near blackness we see the glimmer of a gun. When the music stops as the curtains are shut, the only source of light in the room now gone, we hear the crack of the first gun shot.Double Indemnity is a classic by all means, the genesis of film noir."
killercharm,"Jun 26, 2022",7/10,A beautifully told true story of a plotting wife who gets her insurance agent in on her plan to kill her husband and collect the insurance by seducing him in a singularly sexy way. Barbara Stanwyck is so good in this thing she could change anyone's mind. It's a delight to watch her go from sly devil to sick monster to pleased cat. One thing a little hard to take in this 21st century era is Edward G. Robinson's misogyny. The way he badmouths his ex-bride and his disdain for women and their shortcomings makes him into a toxic stuffed shirt when he's supposed to be a person.
AuroraLaude,"Jun 4, 2021",10/10,"Billy Wilder directs a film noir classic watched by every film student attending a reputable film school. Wilder and Raymond Chandler adapt the novel by James M. Cain to write a sizzling screenplay about lust, marriage, and greed that is American as apple pie. Cast in an unfamiliar role, Fred MacMurray is impressive in his portrayal as an insurance agent trying to land more than a commission. Barbara Stanwyck delivers one of the best performances of her career, playing a character named after a sexually transmitted infection. Rounding out the leading cast is the great Edward G. Robinson, who plays the role of the conflicted supervisor/friend grappling with codependency. If you're giddy for double entendre, innuendo, and salacious flirtation, then you'll want to smoke 'em if you got 'em."
Groverdox,"Feb 14, 2019",7/10,"""Double Indemnity"" is pretty much the archetypal film noir that DOESN'T feature a private detective. It's the story about the guy who gets led by the femme fatale into killing her uncaring spouse. But how do these people know they can trust each other? They are, after all, murderers.This has been done many times since, though arguably, never better. Regardless, we are familiar enough with the story that its effects are a little bit muted. Furthermore, the climax of the picture is confusing. One person gets shot, then another one by the same gun, which somehow changed hands in an embrace?It is, regardless, a must-see for anybody interested in the genre."
braddugg,"Sep 19, 2014",8/10,"If you are in insurance business or if you love films in general, then it's a must watch.Now this is a film that is based on insurance and how an insurance clause of ""Double Indemnity"" can be used for getting someone killed. Billy Wilder unveils his genius again by keeping it believable and yet so emphatically thrilling till the last minute. We know well in the beginning that it's about murder. 20 minutes in the film, we also know that is the murder of a man, whom the wife is cheating on.Now, this turns on into somewhat unexpected as the plan goes a bit berserk with the protagonist unable to understand the woman's character. He thought both are in for it, but actually he is being used by the woman. So someone is killed and someone has to be the culprit, now who is it and how is it all done.It's all point blank and detailed to the extent of planning a murder in a very detailed manner, until its blown up. How did Billy Wilder make all of this and from a story of James Cain is just extremely poignant. It's so very relevant even today, that so many people are conspiring against each other, there are suicides and murders more than ever before and all for money, damn.Now, coming to movie it's great in terms of characters, screenplay and the lighting and production design. Acting is top notch as is always in most of Billy Wilder's movies. And above all, we have the captain Billy who is responsible for the way this film was made and he must be applauded in every sense. Just look at that scene in the beginning where Neff interprets the intentions of Phyliis is where you understand that everything is right in this film. From lighting to dialogues, all of them have added in creating the atmosphere that is for sure thrilling and suspense.This is noir film and has an open ending with us leaving to think what could have happened to Walter Neff. It's 4/5 for a film that's a must see. Just love Billy Wilder more and more as I keep getting back to his films."

atlasmb,"Jul 19, 2015",8/10,"I have seen this film before, but tonight I saw a remastered version in theater as part of TCM's series. I felt that the quality of sound was uneven, but otherwise it was very satisfying.Like Billy Wilder's ""Sunset Boulevard"", most of the action is related via flashback. Fred McMurray plays an insurance salesman, Walter Neff, who dictates the story into a machine for his claims manager, Barton Keyes (Edward G. Robinson). The story revolves around Neff's relationship with a client's wife, Phyllis Dietrichson (Barbara Stanwyck)--a shady lady who is unhappy in her marriage.This film is considered one of the best examples of film noir and is routinely on best films lists. The B&W photography certainly supports that claim and it is an excellent film, but it has a shortfall.Fred McMurray was generally regarded as a film good guy. Wilder convinced him that he could play Neff, an unsavory character. He was right, of course, and he would do it again for Wilder in the film ""The Apartment"". But the tough-guy lingo that comes from McMurray's lips, especially in the early part of the film, seems out of place--not because it's McMurray saying it, but because his character is an insurance salesman. Such Chandleresque dialogue feels natural coming from Bogart's private dick in ""The Maltese Falcon"" or from John Garfield's drifter in ""The Postman Always Rings Twice"", but not here.We might also ask if Barbara Stanwyck is convincing as a woman who could drive Neff to obsession or moral abandon. Perhaps, but it's debatable. I don't think there would be a debate if the actress was Lana Turner (""Postman"") or Kathleen Turner (""Body Heat"").It is interesting they way Wilder gets the viewer to identify with Neff. When there are threats to Neff's nefarious plan, the viewer feels his anxiety. That adds to the film's feeling of suspense, even though the viewer has an idea where the story is going.Edward G. Robinson is brilliant as the corporate crime solver with a nose for fraud. He is the moral compass of the film. In this film, Wilder provides a glimpse of the genius that would produce so many masterpieces to come."
christopher-underwood,"Jul 17, 2017",10/10,"There is not really much steaming passion here, nothing like what you might expect from a film based upon a story by James M Cain. I have previously noted that Barbara Stanwyck seems a little lacking in this department, despite the odd alluring glance. But it is Fred MacMurray I noticed on this viewing rather unconvincing. Then it occurred to me that we are so used to thinking of Stanwyck's character (maybe even her) as being rather cold and calculating, that we do not notice the similar position of MacMurray. He even says at some point (to himself probably) that he is keen to see if he can beat his own company, more specifically his rather close chum, here played immaculately by Edward G Robinson. Even though this is all told in flashback and much of it in voice over, it is hard to criticise a frame of this remarkable movie of greed, power and deceit. Even though the origin is a Cain short story, Billy Wilder and more significantly, Raymond Chandler have crafted the script and the combination of talents managed to produce a sharp and witty dialogue driven film that can be watched so many times."
gawd-58120,"Oct 31, 2018",N/A,"This film noir is held up as one of the best of the genre, and I think it's deserving of that title. The acting is great. Every performance is played seriously and very well, which adds to this film's atmosphere. The atmosphere is also enhanced by this film's lighting. All the nighttime scenes are very dimly lit, and make great use of light peaking through blinds. Aesthetically, Double Indemnity is practically perfect. The beginning of the movie does sort of spoil the ending because of Neff's narration, but it's left vague enough so the viewer isn't quite sure of what actually happened. Overall, this is an amazing film noir."
HIATO1,"Aug 4, 2002",10/10,"Billy's best with Some like hot and the best film noir ever made. If you watch this one, I hardly can imagine you being deceived. The set, the acting (specially a Stanwyck in a 1000%), the script and the direction, the music... Everything can be the best for a film noir. The scene of the crime is fascinating, with a short plane of the diabolically happy Cooper's face after sounding the claxon, and the elegance (Wilder) of not to show the murder explicitly, but only to suggest what is happening by this plane. If you have seen Garnet's The postman always rings twice, you're likely to prefer this one, although Garnet's movie may be very good. If you like film noir, and you have not seen this one (¡!), after seeing it, you will be able to remember a lot of scenes, scripts and all sort of details in every movie made after Double indemnity that have been developed or taken out from it: from Kasdan's Body heat to Verhoeven's Basic Instinct or Edel's Body of Evidence -look at the pyjamas of Stanwick in the last scene-. This one can be considered as one of the best ""telling by flashback"" Hollywood classic movies, with Curtiz' Mildred Pierce -based upon another Cain's novel, as The postman is too-. The worst... Well, I think it's Stanwick hair-stylist, but I prefer watching the good things... The rest of the film."
TeamReCare,"Dec 23, 2021",10/10,"A cinematic classic. A film that is on anyone's 'Must see films before you die"" who appreciate good films. This film will make you thing about the the person you'll take a Trolly ride with. The introduction of the Femme Fatale is a lesson in introduction of character in film."
joker-scar,"Sep 17, 2018",9/10,"This is truly one of the first film noir's to come out of Hollywood after the war, but this treasure came out in 1944. Still a crisp and tense tale of greedy people thinking they can get away with murder is timeless. Fred MacMurray... not the first choice or the most obvious, but he turns in the best performance of his entire career in this one. Much has been said about Barbara Stanwyck's much hated cheap blonde wig but I saw it as a young man and thought nothing about it until I starting reading these things about it. Still doesn't bother me at all. Edward G. is perfectly cast as the brainy hero-guy who is also MacMurray's workaholic boss.
 I must say I have grown to appreciate Billy Wilders films much more in the last few years with the release of his works being released on blu ray format. His witty/satirist writing still holds up decades later and should be studied by writing students. The cinematography is in glorious B&W and uses for the most part real L.A. locations which I have always found better anyway. I always hated that well-lit stage set look that early films seem to have. 
This is a MUST for any serious film buff or even the average film goer who likes well crafted suspense."
Kirpianuscus,"Jul 7, 2015",N/A,"it has the rare gift to be more than a film noir or a classic. it is smart, it is surprising, it is a precise puzzle who remains long time in a series of clear memories. and not the inspired cast or for the good script. but for a form of creativity and courage who does it a real challenge for the viewer. because it could be one from many crime films of ''40's . but something who gives new and new details at each new view does it special. a film about love and about need of the other. about challenges and the film who change in great measure the image of Fred MacMurray. or Edward G. Robinson. one of the most strange roles for Barbara Stanwyck who does more than a real good job. short- a remarkable film. and that fact transforms it in a refreshing surprise. again and again."
