bLuR-7,"Feb 12, 2018",9/10,"Having watched it for the second time recently, I was struck by how razor-sharp the film's script actually was. Sure, it didn't have a big Agatha Christie-type mystery reveal; but the banter and repartee between the main characters was just so well-written. Of course, the film's framing and camerawork is legendary (for good reason) and Grace Kelly has a luminous screen presence. Suspenseful, intriguing, and a film that shows off a master at the peak of his craft."
telegonus,"Apr 8, 2001",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window, wittily written by John Michael Hayes, is one of his many films I think of as much of a technical exercise as anything else. It is in this sense like his silent The Lodger, the static, confined Lifeboat, and the cut-less, one set Rope. Considered in this light it is a cold masterpiece, playing more with the audience's thoughts and fears than with its softer, more personal emotions. As such, it is a very cerebral and satisfying piece of work. The plot is deceptively simple: a photographer (James Stewart) is stuck indoors with his leg in a cast during a hot New York summer. His socialite girl-friend (Grace Kelly) is eager to marry him but Stewart has his doubts, since he lives a wandering life and is from a different social class. He spends most of his time idling about and playing with his camera. In time he becomes a voyeur (which he probably already is, to a degree) and begins to observe his neighbors' private lives, as he views them through his lens in the courtyard. He develops attitudes toward each of them, ranging from mild amusement to empathy to sexual interest, depending on who he's looking at. Without realizing it he is really looking at different aspects of either himself or his relationship with Kelly. The courtyard is a kind of mirror of his soul. These people and their predicaments represent different sides of his (and to a lesser extent Miss Kelly's) personality, offering glimpses of potential past, present and future selves; and it is not always a flattering picture. The newlyweds are continually having sex; Miss Torso is a beautiful young woman who entertains many suitors; there is a childless, somewhat pathetic-seeming middle-aged couple who dote over a pet dog; Miss Lonelyhearts is a depressed, aging spinster with no apparent friends; and the young, bachelor song-writer, when he isn't trying to compose songs, is either throwing parties or fits. Then there are the Thorwalds, a squabbling couple across the way. Stewart is at first only slightly interested in them until Mrs. Thorwald disappears and her husband starts going out at night carrying paper parcels that look like they came from a butcher shop. Soon Stewart is, understandably, suspicious. He convinces Kelly that something is amiss, but has trouble with his detective friend. His nurse Stella agrees that something is wrong across the courtyard, and the threesome become amateur detectives. Rear Window is great fun. It's a thriller, a romance, a mystery, and at times a comedy of manners. The actors all give superb, unflashy performances. Hitchcock had been making movies for three decades by the time he undertook this one, and he knew exactly what he was doing; everything happens as it should, on time, with no fuss or bother. The courtyard set is magnificently designed and photographed; it looks both artificial and realistic, and seems almost to change at times, as circumstances dictate. This is, after Dial M For Murder, Hitchcock's first truly 'fifties' film, which is to say it is a far cry from the genteel romances and spy stuff he'd been doing before. There's less use of atmosphere here, as a new, more independent director was emerging, decidedly post-Selznick, often using color. Hitchcock is playing a sort game of cinematic chess, moving people and things around here and there, changing camera angles slyly, never showing his hand. The film lacks only warmth. All sorts of learned books and articles have been written about this picture, some of them quite silly; all at least partly right. This is at times a profound film, but it also aims to entertain, it has a light touch, and it can be scary, it's romantic about couples and cynical about people. There's a little bit of everything in it,--it's a work of art."
yocarlosvarelapr,"Apr 15, 2018",10/10,"I must say, no signs of aging. Embedded in its day and yet totally relevant. Perhaps the most entertaining of all of Hitchcock's films. Marriage is the theme and murder is the hook. James Stewart is as perfect as he's ever been. He uses the contradictions of his character to create someone immediately familiar. Thelma Ritter's practicality includes a rant about the destructive effect of intelligence. Grace Kelly enters the scene like a character in a dream. She remains a sort of dream that's why to see her climb the killer's balcony is one of my most cherished film memories. If you haven't seen the film you may think I'm rambling but if you have, you know exactly what I mean, don't you?"
dxia,"Apr 8, 2004",10/10,"After viewing 'Rear Window' again, I've come to realize that Alfred Hitchcock was not only a great moviemaker but also a great moviewatcher. In the making of 'Rear Window,' he knew exactly what it is about movies that makes them so captivating. It is the illusion of voyeurism that holds our attention just as it held Hitchcock's. The ability to see without being seen has a spellbinding effect. Why else is it so uncommon to have characters in movies look directly into the camera? It just isn't as fun to watch someone when they know you're there. When we watch movies, we are participating in looking into another world and seeing the images of which we have no right to see and listening to the conversations that we should not hear. 'Rear Window' and Powell's 'Peeping Tom' are some of the best movies that aren't afraid to admit this human trait. We are all voyeurs.When watching 'Rear Window,' it is better to imagine Alfred Hitchcock sitting in that wheelchair rather than Jimmy Stewart. When the camera is using longshots to watch the neighborhood, it is really Hitchcock watching, not Stewart. Hitchcock's love of voyeurism is at the center of this movie, along with his fascination with crime and his adoration of the Madonna ideal.In many of Hitchcock's movies, 'Rear Window,' 'Vertigo,' 'Psycho,' 'The Birds,' etc, the blonde actresses are objects. Notice how rarely they get close with the male leads. In 'Vertigo,' Stewart's character falls in love with the image of Madeleine; in 'Psycho,' we see the voyeur in Hitchcock peeking out of Norman Bates at Marion; and in 'Rear Window,' Jeff would rather stare out of his window than to hold the beautiful Lisa by his side. For Hitchcock, these women are ideals that should be admired rather than touched.However, the story of 'Rear Window' isn't about the image of women, as it is in 'Vertigo.' 'Rear Window' focuses more on seduction of crime, not in committing it but in the act of discovering it. At one point in the story, Jeff's friend convinces him that there was no murder, and Jeff is disappointed, not because someone wasn't dead but because he could no longer indulge into his fantasy that someone was. Think how popular crime shows are on television, and noir films at the movies. People do not want to commit crimes; they want to see other people commit them.'Rear Window' is one of the most retrospective movies I've ever seen. In a span of two hours, it examines some of the most recurrent themes in film. When we watch 'Rear Window,' it is really us watching someone watch someone else. And all the while, Hitchcock is sitting on the balcony and seeing our reaction. It is an act of voyeurism layered on top of itself, and it allows us to examine our own behavior as we are spellbound in Hitchcock's world. The only thing that I feel is missing in the movie is a scene of Jeff using his binoculars and seeing himself in a mirror. Why did Hitchcock leave it out? Maybe because it would have been too obvious what he was doing. Or maybe he was afraid that the audience would see themselves in the reflection of the lens."
Snow Leopard,"Jun 20, 2001",N/A,"One of Hitchcock's greatest masterpieces, ""Rear Window"" is a deep and entertaining classic with many strengths, and a little bit of everything.  A fine suspense story is combined with romantic tension in the main plot, and there are numerous sub-plots, some humorous and some moving, all with many psychological overtones.  The main characters are wonderfully portrayed and full of life.  The apparently simple setting in an apartment complex is developed into a world filled with intriguing and sometimes unsettling possibilities, and this apparently average neighborhood comes to life with a wealth of lavish visual detail and interesting minor characters.  It is the kind of film-making that (like many of Hitchcock's greatest movies) is very flattering to the viewer.  The director assumes that his audience will pay close enough attention to appreciate the many subtleties with which he has filled the movie.  It rewards both careful attention and repeated viewings, since there is much more here than merely a suspense plot, as good as that story is in itself.For the first 30 minutes or so, we simply get to know the characters.  Jimmy Stewart gives one of his best performances as a photographer recuperating from an injury, forced to spend several weeks staring out his apartment window at the minor dramas in the lives of his neighbors.  Grace Kelly is ideal in the role of his perfect girlfriend, who can never find a way to break down Stewart's reserve.  The study of their relationship would have made a good movie by itself.  Almost every action and every word between them is filled with meaning, and what they see in the lives of others is an interesting reflection of the tensions and possibilities in their own present and future.  Thelma Ritter is wonderful as a colorful, no-nonsense nurse who constantly sheds some light - sometimes unwanted - on what is happening between them.  The action and suspense that occur later serves in large part as a catalyst that resolves some of the important issues between the two.After we get to know the characters and their world, things start to happen, as Stewart becomes engrossed in some of the things he has seen.  The ethical and moral concerns of meddling in others' affairs become intertwined with more urgent questions about what may have happened in those other apartments, and from then on the tension builds steadily.  It leads up to a riveting climactic sequence filled with suspense, and made even more meaningful by our awareness of its deeper significance to the main characters.There is much more that could be said, but you should see this for yourself. It is a classic that will be enjoyed not only by thriller fans, but by anyone who appreciates carefully crafted movies with a lot of depth."
FlickJunkie-2,"Apr 10, 2001",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock is considered by most to be the master of suspense.  I believe he was also a master of understanding human nature.  He intuitively understood that human beings are voyeurs by nature, not in the perverted sense, but in the curious sense.  We are a species that slows down to look at accident scenes and steals furtive glances at lovers in the park who are oblivious to everything but each other.  A major appeal of cinema and television is that they offer us an opportunity for guilt free voyeurism. When we watch a film, aren't we in essence looking through a window and watching people who behave as if they don't realize we are there?Hitchcock realized this and took voyeurism to the next level, allowing us to watch a voyeur as he watched others.  While `Rear Window' as a whole is probably not quite at a level with `Vertigo' (which was far more suspenseful and mysterious with a powerful musical score) as a cinematic accomplishment, it is more seductive because it strikes closer to our human obsessions. Hitchcock's mastery is most evident in his subtle use of reaction scenes by the various characters.  We watch an event that Jeff (James Stewart) is watching and then Hitchcock immediately cuts to his reaction.  This is done repeatedly in various layers even with the other tenants as they interact with one another.  For instance, in the scene with Miss Lonelyheart (Judith Evelyn), we see her throw out the man who made a pass at her and then we see her reaction after she slams the door, followed by the reaction of Jeff and Lisa (Grace Kelly).  In another scene, Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey) sees Lisa's nightclothes and presumes she will be staying the night.  Hitchcock shows the suitcase, then Doyle's reaction, and then he goes to Jeff who points his finger at him and says `Be Careful, Tom'.  This elegant scene takes a few seconds and speaks volumes with little dialogue.  Such technique gets the viewer fully involved, because if we were there this is exactly what we would be doing, watching the unfolding events and then seeing how others around us responded.  In essence, it puts us in the room with them.Hitchcock was a stickler for detail.  For instance, he aimed the open windows so they would show subtle reflections of places in the apartment we couldn't see directly.  However, there were certain details included or excluded that were inexplicable.  Would Thorwold really be scrubbing the walls with the blinds open?  Would Lisa be conspicuously waving at Jeff while Stella (Thelma Ritter) was digging up the garden?  Moreover, wouldn't Lisa have taken off her high heels before climbing a wall and then a fire escape?  This film had numerous small incongruities that are normally absent from Hitchcock films.  Though these are picayune criticisms, they are painfully obvious in the film of a director known to be a compulsive perfectionist.The acting is superb in this film.  Jimmy Stewart is unabashedly obsessed as the lead character.  Photographers have an innate visual perceptiveness and the ability to tell a story with an image and Stewart adopts this mindset perfectly.  Grace Kelly has often been accused of being the `Ice Maiden' in her films, yet in this film she is assertive and even reckless.  Though cool at times, she is often playful and rambunctious.  I always enjoy Thelma Ritter's performances for their honesty and earthiness and this is another example of a character actor at her best.  Raymond Burr often doesn't get the recognition he deserves for this role, which is mostly shot at a distance with very few lines.  Yet, he imbues Thurwold with a looming nefariousness using predominantly physical acting.This film was rated number 42 on AFI's top 100 of the century sandwiched between `Psycho' (#18) and `Vertigo' (#61).  I personally think more highly of `Vertigo' but it is a minor distinction, because I rated them both 10/10. `Rear Window' is a classic, a masterpiece of filmmaking technique from a director who was a true pioneer of suspense."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Dec 3, 2005",10/10,"Finally, I watched ""Rear Window"" by famous Alfred Hitchcock. First off, I saw this movie on the top 250, and it's #14 on top of that! I mean, it's gotta be great or a classic, right? Also, I'm a fan of the Simpsons, and I got the 6th season where Bart breaks his leg and has to watch the kids outside and accuses Flanders of murdering his wife, Maude. I watched it with commentary and the writers said this was taken from the movie ""Rear Window"", I had to see this movie! I know it sounds silly that I was more inspired by a show, but it's a good reference if it's from The Simpsons.""Rear Window"" is an excellent movie and a great classic that should never be forgotten! After 51 years, this is still a well talked about movie and I can see why. Jimmy Stewart, he's just so great as L.B., I loved his madness and his dark comical role. He doesn't even try, but you can't help but laugh at a lot of his lines, the way he looks, and the way he presents every scene. He didn't have a lot of movement, he is confined to a wheel chair, but he is so effective and perfect. No one could have replaced him as L.B., he's a terrific actor! Grace Kelly, what a beauty! Beauty and talent, what a great combination and she had it. Playing Liza, I loved her character so much. She started out as this extremely feminine lovely woman who is struggling with L.B., because he is having doubts about marrying her, and you can tell she loves him so much and is willing to do anything for him and to make their lives work, despite his adventurous side as a photographer and her being an indoor kitten. When L.B. talks of the murder to Liza, she is doubtful but never dismisses that it could be a possibility, and stays with him into the end. She finally goes into danger and grabs it by the you know what and wins L.B.'s heart.I loved the ending, to me it was just one more good laugh with L.B. and Liza. I won't tell, you'll just have to trust me, it was a brilliant way to breath and smile again after all the suspense and drama. ""Rear Window"" is a true classic and I'm extremely grateful to the reviewers of IMDb who saw this movie and gave it great reviews, and the writers of The Simpsons! If it were not for you guys, I nor other members of my generation would probably not view it! Let's keep this classic alive!10/10"
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 22, 2009",10/10,"Rear Window is a one of the more sophisticated Hitchcock films, and I will always consider it a masterpiece. It has tension, suspense, humour, has a strong voyeuristic tone to it and moves along at a good pace. The cinematography was truly excellent, dark in some scenes and beautiful in another. The script is fantastic and genuinely memorable(Thelma Ritter's wisecracks especially), likewise with the story, about a man who is convinced that his neighbour has killed his wife. I have always considered Rear Window's main merit to be the performance of James Stewart, he was perfect as Jeff, the man who is in a wheelchair, due to a broken leg. The other performances go without fault either, especially from the beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa and Raymond Burr in a chilling performance as ""the villain of the piece,"" Mr Thorwold. The music was expressive and atmospheric courtesy of Franz Waxman, and the climax was possibly the highlight of the film, after Stewart's performance. The 1954 version of Rear Window will always be a classic, not the inferior TV remake with Christopher Reeve. All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
dtb,"Nov 24, 2004",10/10,"Not only does REAR WINDOW (RW) have Alfred Hitchcock's trademark wit, suspense, and romance (with a touch of friction) in spades, but it's one of his most well-crafted, cleverly-staged movies; in fact, even though RW is based on a Cornell Woolrich story, I can't imagine this story being told as effectively in any medium other than cinema. However, the technical accomplishments (explained most entertainingly in the DVD's documentaries) would be nothing without the engaging characters. James Stewart's neighbors are interesting enough to warrant their own movies, and in addition to providing a wry microcosm of New York City life (the only dated thing about it is the lack of air conditioning), they all reflect possible outcomes for the somewhat stormy romance between laid-up shutterbug Stewart and the luminous Grace Kelly as his upscale fashion maven inamorata. As Brent Spiner said while hosting a showing of RW on TNT, the real perversion of the film is Stewart's reluctance to commit to the irresistible Kelly! In fact, one of the things I like about the movie is the way it shows these two very different people gradually learning to compromise and work together. The piquant final shot shows that a woman can have a happy relationship with a man without submerging her own personality -- refreshing for the 1950s! Great supporting cast, too, including Wendell Corey, Raymond Burr in one of his last bad-guy roles before PERRY MASON, and the scene-stealing Thelma Ritter. Incidentally, the restored special edition RW DVD was put together just in time to include Georgine Darcy (""Miss Torso""), then one of the last surviving cast members. Darcy died earlier this year; she will be missed."
christophe92300,"Mar 3, 2013",6/10,"Rear Window is particularly interesting for two things. The first, is the excellent direction and staging, Hitchcock's trademark. The second is the innovative concept of the confined, voyeuristic story.Because let's face it, the script didn't match the expectation. The plot is a lot too predictable from start to finish. One tries to establish theories, collect hypothetical clues, when ultimately there is no surprise at all because everything that Jefferies imagines turns out to be the exact truth. Where are the misleads for examples, one of the basic thriller elements ? In these conditions, the outcome is a real deception because of its predictability.Add the fact that there are overlong passages such as some voyeuristic scenes or well written yet pointless dialogues, and you get a pseudo thriller, little dynamic, with no suspense or tension, that stands out more because of its form that its content."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jul 9, 2023",10/10,"Photographer L. B. Jefferies is temporarily wheelchair bound, and spends his days staring out of his apartment window into the courtyard, observing everyone's activities. He becomes convinced that a murder has occured.Alfred Hitchcock is regarded by many as the master of suspense, and I don't think there's a better example of a suspense thriller than Rear Window.Hitchcock created several masterpieces, Rear Window is one of them, it's a fascinating study of human nature, the natural curiosity and fascination to observe people.Jefferies has a natural curiosity, but his circumstances heighten that curiosity, with nothing else to do, he watches everything, absorbing every single detail. He's essentially looking at a goldfish bowl, his world becomes that courtyard, he sees everything.Every single character is fascinating, the dancer, the woman drinking alone, and or course the man who's wife vanishes.James Stewart is excellent as Jefferies, he is superb in the role, Grace Kelly is terrific also, the epitome of glamour and elegance.Doesn't anyone close their curtains, or pull the blinds, thank goodness they don't.One of my top ten films of all time.10/10."
Bored_Dragon,"Aug 23, 2018",7/10,"The more I watch Hitchcock and the more I compare my impressions with the reviews of other people, the more I start to think that maybe I do not like his style. I love the genre he works with and I appreciate him very much, but either the most reviewers are following the hype and rating his movie too high because that's expected from ""true cinephiles"" or I simply don't get him the way most people do. I saw 16 of his movies so far and my average rating is 6,9 which places him slightly above average. ""Rear Window"" is a perfect example. It is considered to be one of the best films of all time, but to me, it's nothing special. I have no objections to it thou, but I do not see what's there to praise so much. Good movie, but not the great one and definitely overrated.7/10"
Coventry,"Feb 7, 2018",4/10,"This is likely to go down as the least popular user-comment in history, but then so be it. I believe in honesty and freedom of speech. Although universally considered as one of the top three (or maybe top five) best thrillers that Alfred Hitchcock made in his lengthy and undeniably brilliant career, I personally feel that ""Rear Window"" is the most overrated movie of all times and I sincerely can't fathom why it's such a cinematic landmark. I reckon that the basic plot idea is utmost intriguing and that it's rather inventive how the cameras film literally everything from within the same secluded living room location, but that about sums up all the film's strengths. The narcistic photographer L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart) sits immobilized in his apartment, bound to both a wheelchair and a humongous plaster cast around his leg ever since he took too much risk during a photo shoot on a racetrack. Purely out of boredom, he begins to watch all his neighbors across the little cement garden. The watching quickly turns into observing with binoculars and then into spying with his most professional & strongest photo lenses. He then thinks he witnesses a middle-aged man murdering his wife in cold blood, but a befriended police inspector, his lovely girlfriend and even his nosy housekeeper have trouble believing him. I was particularly annoyed by the behavior and ignorance of the protagonist. Jeff is supposed to be an intelligent person, so he must understand or at least respect that the police can't just go invading someone's private property and interrogate them about a possibly felony for which there isn't any evidence. The entire film evidently revolves on L.B. Jefferies' arrogant persona, and of course it doesn't help that I never really liked the actor James Stewart. I can appreciate him when his characters aren't omnipresent, like in Hitchcock's ""Rope"" for example, but here he was rapidly getting on my nerves. The other characters, including Grace Kelly who never looked prettier, are downgraded to mere extras. I am also aware that practically every review praises that the powerful impact of ""Rear Window"" lies in the fact that it's a statement on the human towards voyeurism and blah blah, but to me a film has to be entertaining and plausible first and foremost.""Read Window"" along with ""Vertigo"" and ""The Man Who Knew Too Much"" made me realize that can't get into Hitch's espionage or 'wrong-man-condemned' thrillers, and that I find his more polished thrillers extremely boring, unrealistic and overrated. I'm primarily a horror fanatic, and thus love the nasty Hitchcock films the most, like ""Psycho"", ""Shadow of a Doubt"", ""Rope"" and ""Frenzy""."
chaz-76862,"Mar 29, 2018",10/10,"Wow, this movie was just great.Everything about it was just flawless. The pacing and the story kept me on the edge of my seat for the whole run time. I felt invested in the story and was interested about where it would go next. The acting was superb and helped pushed this film along. I also particularly liked how it didn't tell us everything from the beginning and we had to figure the mystery out along with the actors.In one sentence: ""one of the best films ever made""."
Aidan McGuinness,"Nov 12, 2002",N/A,"Ah it's a movie that's in IMDB's Top 20, and it has good reason to be. For starter's let's look at the simple premise - James Stewart is L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is currently recovering from an injury on assignment. With his broken leg he's stuck in his apartment, with nothing better to do than spy on his neighbours and be visited by his girlfriend, Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly), his officer friend Wendell, and his nurse, Stella. Jeffries observes the coming and goings of the various apartments he can observe (from his rear apartment window) and it is one of these - a Raymond Burr - who draws his attention because. could it be that the man has committed some heinous crime? Let's find out.One of the beautiful things about the movie is its superb use of location. The whole movie, bar a couple of brief scenes, is set in the apartment. This would seem claustrophobic but Hitchcock never inhibits us like this - he lets us escape through Jeffries binoculars and camera lenses, and his roving camera swoops down to let us see what the characters see (but never, thankfully, anything more than that - this is how you do suspense!). The set design is wonderful - the apartment is just the right size and is nicely laid out. However the real praise is for all the other apartments visible to Jeffries - an actual habitable set with multiple stories where characters can be observed only as they pass by their own windows (yeah, they don't care much for curtains). There's a sense of individuality gone in to each home, despite the fact we can only see barely elements of each. This is helped by a nice, differing range of characters inhabiting each and going about their daily lives - there's a mini soap-opera contained in the movie, all observed at a distance. Excellent stuff.Acting? It's great here. There's some nice depth to the characters here, with them feeling like actual real people rather than slick one-dimensional tags. Stewart is very proficient in this type of role - he was born to it - and Kelly proves she is more than just a pretty face, managing to effuse her character with both grace (*groan*) and steel. Even supporting characters like Stella are good (she has a wickedly black sense of thinking that's hilarious). What's so incredible is that the characters we observe from a distance in the other apartments (and with whom we never actually interact with) have as much depth as most main characters in movies nowadays. Excellent script and acting in this movie.I've already praised Hitchcock's set location and camera work, so I won't prattle on about him much more. He does a stellar job here and, in my opinion, this is the best piece of work he's done (that I've seen). It's virtually flawless and you're never let down (or bored). Well done. It's a shame he lost out on an Oscar (although he did have tough competition that year with `On the Waterfront').`Rear Window' is a great example of how you can successfully have sharp acting, script, and directing and not feel the need for a slew of swear words and gratuitous violence. Regarded as a classic, and deservedly so. 9.1/10"
Quinoa1984,"Jan 15, 2004",10/10,"Many reviewers and critics have commented on Alfred Hitchcock's theme of the voyeur in Rear Window (the mere thought of a voyeur in a suspense film conjures up images from other classic Hitchcock films), and I felt that voyeuristic bug as well.  But I realized something that I hadn't thought of as I watched it for the first time- this is a return for Hitchcock to his skills as a master of silent-film chills.  As L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart in one of his most infamous performances) is in his wheelchair viewing out one perspective to other inhabitants in the apartment, the audience views right along-side him.  So, for more or less 50 percent of the film, the only sounds we hear are the sounds of mere realism, as Hitch's camera keeps a close eye on things.As the thrills build in the second hour of the film there is considerably more dialog than the first hour.  This could, and occasionally does, present a challenge for the audience member that could either be accepted & payed off or resented- can one sit back and just watch things unfold as in a film from the 20's?  Personally, the experience of seeing these events unfold and increase was near electrifying.  Along with Stewart's performance, which ranges from amusing to terrified, compelling to frightened (i.e. Hitch's 'everyday man'), there's Grace Kelly as Lisa, who carries her own beauty & inner conflicts, and Raymond Burr as Thorvold, who could have things going a little better with his wife.If we empathize with Jeff, it's because we become as much apart of his mind-set/POV as he already is, and that's the ticket to the film's true success.  Not only is there a magnetic kind of skill to which Hitchcock (and cinematographer Robert Burks) presents us with the apartments' supporting and minor characters and how their fates are played out against the enclosed backdrop, but the psychology of Jeff becomes parallel, or against, to the audience's.  This is the story of one man's temptation and compulsion to be involved with those he can see (much like movie-goers have with any given film), and how perception of the realities around him become ours.  Rear Window may have become dated for some movie-goers, particularly since the theme has been played on by other movies and TV shows (like The Simpsons for example).  Yet there is a certain effectiveness to it all, even in the earlier scenes, that holds an edge over imitators.  A+"
michaelRokeefe,"Jun 18, 2000",9/10,"In '54, I was seven years old and this is one of the first 'grown up' movies I remember seeing. I have seen it at least ten times since and realize seeing something different each time.James Stewart is a photographer in a wheelchair recovering from an accident. He passes the time by watching his neighbors out his apartment window. He thinks that he witnessed a murder and has trouble convincing his girlfriend, Grace Kelly, to help prove a crime was committed.Three scenes that always stuck with me:(1) Stewart fighting off his attacker with flashbulbs (2) the smoldering kiss (3) the glowing cigarette in the dark apartment.Every bit a classic. I think this is THE BEST Hitchcock movie. No offense intended toward PSYCHO, but this movie has the more human aspects of fear and terror. This super cast includes Raymond Burr, Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey."
ronakkotian,"Jul 15, 2021",10/10,"Rear Window is a film that's been talked about for decades and having finally watched it, I can see why.Rear Window follows L. B. Jefferies, a wheelchair-bound photographer who spies on his neighbours from his window and becomes convinced one of them has committed a murder.There's so much Rear Window does extremely well but what I really love is its commentary on voyeurism and how Alfred Hitchcock manipulates the audience. The stofy is very interesting and Hitchcock makes sure we see it through our protagonist, L. B. Jefferies. Having him be wheelchair-bound connects the audience with him further as we're also in the same position. Hitchcock also restricts the camera within his apartment without letting us explore inside the neighbours' worlds. We only see what Jefferies sees and based on that we form our own opinions on his neighbours just like him. This sparks the debate on voyeurism and the morality of it. Should we really be peering into other people's lives? It's a trait we have and it's what we do when we watch films or TV shows. We're taken into a new world with characters we're unfamiliar with and we form our assumptions based off what is shown on screen. Hitchcock uses this to his advantage to toy with our thoughts and question what we're viewing. He never shows us what's fully going on in these people's lives which helps us doubt our protagonist and adds to the mystery of what's really happening.Hitchcock builds the tension so well by constantly making us go back and forth on what we think is going on, leading to one of the most suspenseful climaxes I've seen in a film. The dark cinematography accompanied by the absence of the score makes up for a truly thrilling yet entertaining finish. No wonder he's regarded as ""The Master of Suspense"". Having James Stewart play the lead was a great choice considering his much loved persona during the time. He's likeable in the role and plays the character really well. Grace Kelly is elegant all the way through. I love the development of the relationship between her and Stewart and she adds a real charm to the film. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey were also great in their roles. Despite having very few lines, Raymond Burr was excellent as the mysterious Mr. Thorwald.This is one of Alfred Hitchcock's best works. With beautiful filmmaking, intriguing social commentary and fantastic acting, Rear Window is a classic that people should see immediately."
danielefanin-17409,"May 9, 2020",9/10,"Why on earth a man, heterosexual and still relatively young, would spend his time looking out of his window when in his rooms there is a woman like Grace Kelly could be the real mystery left after watching Rear Window, the 1954 masterpiece directed by Alfred Hitchcock.Besides this cheeky and impudent question, this is really a masterpiece, one of the films most loved by his director and one of his more sophisticated, both narratively as well as cinematographically. Loosely based on a relatively unknown 1942 short story written by Cornell Woolrich, It Had to Be Murder, Rear Window sees L.B. Jefferies, a successful photo reporter played with enough confidence and progressive involvement by James Stewart, confined in his New York small apartment with a broken and plastered leg. In the sweltering summer heat, he turns and focuses his attention and lenses to the neighbouring apartments facing his condo's backyard, observing them with a fast growing interest that rapidly becomes excited voyeurism when he starts suspecting that a uxoricide took place in an opposite flat. Albeit reluctantly, also his beautiful fiancée Lisa, a Grace Kelly whose first appearance in the film is one of the most esthetically captivating close ups in movies history and fully justifies the hot ice nickname given to her allegedly by Alfred Hitchcock, as well as both the solid, down to earth nurse Stella, caustically played by a vitriolic Thelma Ritter, and the reluctant detective Tom Doyle, a fairly stolid Wendell Corey full of banal common sense, are drawn into his obsession with what neighbour Lars Thorwald, an imposing Raymond Burr, might or might not have done to his nagging wife.The opening credits reveal straight away one of the movie's multiple codes, when the curtains of James raise to reveal the fixed scene of the coming attraction, the very same back yard where all flats look into. From then on, a static journey begins that reverses many established principles of the 50s filmmaking: the main character does not move, all the other, secondary casts actually play in front of him. The viewer, barring a short yet important moment when James Stewart falls asleep, has the same point of view of the protagonist, sees and interprets the story through the eyes and expressions of him. The soundtrack comes from within the movie, mostly heard from one of the apartments where a musician is living.All these filmic and narrative details, together with the crafted and perfect jigsaw of which each apartment and neighbours' live is a piece, are added to the self-conscious study of voyeurism and the essential role of cinema to make an essential film, where no shot, no dialogue is redundant, and an evergreen masterpiece, at the same time celebrating and subverting the Hollywood's codes.
This is not the only Hitchcock's movie constructed in a theatrical form, but in no other the British master was able to extremize with such genius and depth of analysis the intertwined relationships between the eye and the mind, mixing like an esoteric alchemist obsessions and humor, suspense and sexuality, flashing light and silent darkness, individuality and collectivity, reality and perceptions.
Peeping Toms of the world, unite!"
StevePulaski,"Dec 9, 2013",10/10,"The opening shot Alfred Hitchcock's masterwork Rear Window is a chilling one; one that shows off the film's bold colors, common setting, and artistic voyeurism. It simply shows the small courtyard outside that can be viewed through the rear windows of the Greenwich Village in Lower Manhattan, specifically James Stewart's character's, as the bright red blinds roll up, revealing each individual section of the window. Playing in the background is a peaceful score and after about one minute and forty seconds of credits and a static camera, Hitchcock moves us outside that window, showing us the sights of the village's backyard. From flower beds, to cats lounging around, to a dog being transported from the top balcony to the ground below, etc, the sight is familiar and commonplace to this specific setting. After a few minutes of a relaxing and almost romantic stroll through the wonders of Greenwich's backyard we meet out main character.His name is L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart), a professional photographed now confined to a wheelchair after breaking his leg. He remains in his apartment during a brutal heatwave, where he and his neighbors keep their windows open all day and night. Jeff passes the time by watching his neighbors go about their daily routines; one of which is a young, attractive dancer he cleverly names ""Miss Torso"", a woman who often sits all by her lonesome, a pianist, a sculptor, and Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a wife confined to her bedroom because of an illness.Jeff frequently gets visits from his wealthy and gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), but while the two have notable chemistry and know how to take care of each other well, Jeff simply views her as too perfect. He confesses this to Stella (Thelma Ritter), the sassy, home-care nurse he has been assigned to and states how he would much rather have a woman with more visible flaws than one who seems to ooze perfection and gorgeousness with every step she makes.One night, however, this thought becomes nothing but a faint memory when Jeff awakes to the sound of a woman screaming and glass breaking. The noise comes from Thorwald's apartment, the apartment directly across from Jeff's rear window. Jeff then sees Thorwald leaving his home and is troubled by the sudden disappearance of Thorwald's wife over the next few days. Frequent spying and self-contemplation (along with bouncing the ideas off of the heads of Lisa and Stella) leads Jeff to arrive at the conclusion that Thorwald murdered his wife for reasons unknown to him. He then spends long hours watching Thorwald's every move, trying to arrive at a sensible conclusion for an action that is unjustifiable.Hitchcock achieves the power and impact necessary for a film like this thanks to his act of making the audience a voyeur in their own right. We can judge Jeff about snooping and eavesdropping on his neighbors all we want, but are we looking away during the film? Are we the ones covering our eyes when Jeff pulls out binoculars to see across the courtyard? If not, and we're criticizing him for his actions, we are not only hypocrites but we are condemning ourselves and our own actions. We are disagreeing with our own practices and not even recognizing them.Hitchcock leaves us with this uncomfortable feeling of seeing something we're really not supposed to or overhearing things that weren't intended for our ears. This kind of filmmaking is wonderful, especially for the time when audiences were most often used to being in a place of comfort. Films of the fifties, like Singin' in the Rain, offered a happier escape and put us in a place of joyful exuberance. Hitchcock dared to make us feel uncomfortable and make us feel unsettled at all times. He utilized lengthy shots, establishing a mood by showing off all the simple, day-to-day occurrences in a typical courtyard in America. These lengthy shots are key to the film's success. The only thing better than Jeff and Lisa conversing about everyday life or their relationship is when the scenes do the talking for us and that's key to Rear Window's success. It keeps a simple story relatively basic but also dares to let us experience the environment without the burden of chatter.Every Hitchcock film has, what he has dubbed, a ""MacGuffin,"" or something tangible (or intangible) that the characters in the film are searching for that we, the audience, may or may not care about. The MacGuffin here is simply proof, proof in favor of Jeff's case. With this MacGuffin, the audience is put in an odd place. We want Jeff to achieve the satisfaction of him being able to prove his case and not be made a fool of, but we also want this all to be a misunderstanding and find that Thorwald's wife isn't really dead. The way Hitchcock goes about trying to give us a two-faced MacGuffin is enticing entertainment.Rear Window is invigorating with tremendous features that make thrillers interesting. From lengthy shots, to great performances, to an interesting premise, and the idea of repercussions arising from unintentional actions. My knowledge and resume for Hitchcock films is depressingly low for a cinephile, and seeing Rear Window was a ""right place at the right time"" event considering my relatively low faith in modern thrillers and crime capers.Starring: James Stewart, Grace Kelly, Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey, and Raymond Burr. Directed by: Alfred Hitchcock."
gordongeordie,"Mar 27, 2020",10/10,"This is, without fear of contradiction, a masterpiece. Before setting out on the journey, if you are given a synopsis, it's difficult to imagine how the slight story can hold one's attention for nearly two hours. There are in effect multiple plots extending beyond the suspected murder. Each apartment holding it's own narrative and inviting the viewer into the private lives of the block. We care about all the characters in these sub plots, holding both humour and tragedy in their confined spaces. The developing relationship between the two excellent leads is the icing on the cake. Grace Kelly is stunning, and did James Stewart ever make a bad film? Hitchcock in his prime."
PCC0921,"Mar 31, 2022",10/10,"Voyeurism, the stimulation of the libido and a slick murder mystery are the key instruments used by Hitchcock in Rear Window (1954). However, the most important aspect of this film, that must garner attention, is the incredible sense of timing, in all aspects of this film. Just like the magic he was able to tap into, six years earlier, with Rope (1948), the timing in this film is perfect also. I guarantee something like this could not be duplicated today the way it was then. Today's filmmakers would wind up using computers, CGI effects and every other technological trick available in the 21st century, but all Hitchcock had was a stopwatch. The fact that Hitchcock was able to orchestrate all of this is incredible. Each window is its own movie or play, that has to start and end on time, so the camera can move onto the next window. Each actor had to be ready to say their line, pick up a newspaper or play a song on the piano in the allotted amount of time needed.Another incredible aspect, that clearly represented Hitchcock's greatness, was his ability to exhume emotions from his actors with minimal use of energy. Of course, the actors had a little hand in this themselves. Grace Kelly, with plenty of clothes on, saying appropriate lady-like things, was able to show a sexiness, that is on par with, in today's terms, with Jessica Alba in a bikini. Please don't tell me, that you are not on the edge of your seat, watching Raymond Burr do whatever the heck he is doing throughout the film. You do not want to close your eyes out of fear of what might come next. The stimulation of the libido, seeing the woman as the stronger character, watching people in a voyeuristic way, would not have worked as well as it does, if this wasn't a Hitchcock film. This is why, for my money, Rear Window (1954), is the greatest movie ever made. Oh! Did I mention that Jimmy Stewart was in it? As always, he is awesome.9.9 (A+ MyGrade) = 10 IMDB."
bkoganbing,"Dec 30, 2005",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's second film with James Stewart is the story of Stewart's enforced idleness due to a broken leg. He's an active man, a news photographer, who constantly pushes himself into dangerous situations to get a picture and got a broken leg incidentally. Idleness for him is sure torture.Fortunately or unfortunately as things turn out he has a Greenwich Village apartment with a Rear Window that allows him to look on the neighbors across the courtyard. It's like watching about 15 different soap operas at once. And with his photographic equipment including a zoom telephoto lens, Stewart gets himself involved with the various soap opera plots.Stewart also has a girl friend in Grace Kelly who is playing a part that is really no stretch for her, a Park Avenue chic and rich woman who's really had quite a life of comfort. Stewart doesn't think she's ready for his kind of life and they have a running quarrel.That is until Stewart puts some conclusions together from observing one of the apartments and he thinks that salesman Raymond Burr has killed his wife. Although he can't convince his detective friend Wendell Corey, he does slowly convince Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter his nurse of the validity of his conclusions.Everyone here does a creditable job, but I think the best performance comes from Raymond Burr. Burr, who played a lot of villains on the screen, usually plays them tough and mean. Hitchcock did a superb job in getting a performance of a really frightened man. Seeing the story of Burr and his wife through Stewart's eyes, it's the story of two very ordinary people apparently mismatched. Up until the last 15 minutes of Rear Window, we see Burr at a distance like the rest of Stewart's soap operas. When we do see him up close we find a very ordinary, but frightened man. It's his very ordinariness that makes Burr so frightening. The audience sees themselves in him, could we commit murder if sufficiently pushed hard enough?I suppose if James Stewart had a broken leg in 2005 and was laid up that way, he'd be busy on his personal computer and wouldn't have time to be looking across the courtyard. Televisions were still a luxury item in 2005. My grandparents still didn't have one at that date. Today Stewart could get all the afternoon soap opera action he wanted.A remake of Rear Window was done in 1998 with Christopher Reeve. Of course the difference is that Reeve was a paraplegic and dealing with a real and permanent situation on film and in his life. It was a whole new kind of Rear Window.Rear Window has all the elements one expects from Hitchcock, thrilling plot, witty and sophisticated dialog and a wry conclusion to it all. A very enjoyable film."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jul 17, 2020",10/10,"'Rear Window (1954)' is one of the greatest films of all time, a thriller that does more with its single location than most movies do with their entire world. With restrained yet masterful direction, a witty yet suspenseful script and down-to-earth yet powerhouse performances, the piece solidifies itself as one of the most gripping, edge-of-your-seat and exciting experiences of its kind. That's even more impressive when you consider that its protagonist is wheelchair-bound for its duration and that the only real danger to him comes towards the flick's explosive final third. It's just phenomenal, really. It sucks you in straight away and doesn't let you go until it ends, keeping you watching with bated breath and smiling lips. It's so well-crafted in every aspect that it's difficult to find any flaws with it, however small they may be. It really is one of the most enjoyable pictures... well, ever. I love it. 10/10"
jamesjustice-92,"Jun 7, 2022",10/10,"Have you ever gotten the feeling like you're being watched when you're standing on the balcony or doing some housework at your apartment? There are a lot of peeping Toms out there who watch other people; I'm sure we've all caught ourselves peeping out the window once in a while to see what our neighbors are doing, and for what? Is our life too unexciting? Do we have nothing better to do? I guess it's just in the human nature to be interested in somebody else's business especially when our imagination can allow us to make up an exciting story behind ordinary lives of others.""Rear window"" tells a story of a photographer who has to stay at home because of a broken leg and because he got used to excitement he seeks it in the lives of his neighbors; and you know what they say - if you're looking for adventures you will surely find some.There's something fishy going on in everyone's lives if you're just looking from outside. ""Rear window"" proves its name by telling us that not all we see and interpret reflects the reality but sometimes it does. James Stewart's character knows what he wants - a life full of fun, solving mysteries, getting impressions, doing what he does best; Grace's character also knows what she wants and that's to be with the person she loves no matter what inconveniences might come her way. She wants to find the bridge that could connect her to her loved one on the other side even if it lies through somebody else's abyss.""Rear window"" is a perfect example of a thriller: a presumably light-hearted mood at the beginning, a little drama and something to think about, a mystery, its slowly growing suspense with a cherry of paranoia and doubts on top, the pinnacle and the final resolution. Almost complete absence of musical score makes you sit nervously glued to your chair along with the main protagonist and watch this wonderful picture until the end."
jeida,"Dec 5, 2000",4/10,"This movie was a very influential piece by a very influential man.  They tell me this flick changed the way some things were done in the movie business.  I am told by others that this one is one of the truly best of Hitchcock's, well worth checking out.  I, nevertheless walked into this movie with an open mind.  A mind that quickly got bored.I did like the caught-up-in-the-mystery feeling that flashed through a few scenes.  I did like the famous drawl of James Stewart, and his character's wit throughout.  And I am now interested in reading some of Cornel Woolrich's short stories, from which this screenplay was created.  But still, I was bored.Leaving behind the ""importance"" of this movie and only commenting on how it affected me, I only give it a four out of ten.  On my personal rating scale that's counted as ""not great, not horrible, don't bother.""  See it if you must.  It is, after all, one of the talked about films in certain circles. If you have not seen it and end up in one of those circles, rest assured that the person extolling it's genius is most likely paraphrasing a magazine article he or she read last night and is not too sure what they are supposed to think about this one."
EUyeshima,"Mar 5, 2006",10/10,"It doesn't have the psychological complexity or panoramic sweep of his later films, but 1954's ""Rear Window"" is arguably his most fun film to watch. An entire Greenwich Village apartment complex and courtyard was built inside a Paramount studio building to create Hitchcock's unforgiving microcosm of lonely souls that stretches the ethical envelope of voyeurism. James Stewart plays L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, an adventure photographer, wheelchair-bound with a week left in his cast for a broken leg. He is itching for some excitement and not even the devoted attention of an impossibly beautiful Grace Kelly as Lisa, a Park Avenue fashion model is enough for him. Stuck in his apartment all day, he sees the comings and goings of his neighbors, all strangers to him, and pieces together their lives and gives them pseudonyms like ""Miss Torso"" and ""Miss Lonelyhearts"". But his attention focuses on a suspicious, white-haired man named Thorwald. Jeff becomes increasingly intrigued by his neighbor's odd behavior and the sudden disappearance of his nagging, bedridden wife. Jeff suspects a murder plot, which seems far-fetched at first, but becomes gradually more evident as his obsession infects Lisa, his masseuse Stella and his detective buddy Tom.Hitchcock was indeed the master of suspense, but the movie is suffused with an unexpectedly light sense of humor that touches rather candidly on sex and relationships thanks to John Michael Hayes' sharp script. Lisa's entanglement with Thorwald is played out well, especially as Jeff looks on helplessly from his apartment. Stewart is wonderfully sly throughout, giving hints of the inner torment he displays later in ""Vertigo"" but still likable even as he tries to reject his glamorous, sheltered girlfriend. Kelly seems merely decorative at first, but she sharpens as her character gains a fearless sense of intrigue that Jeff finds alluring. Thelma Ritter plays a smarter and warmer variation of her typical wisecracker as Stella, while Wendell Corey is his usual nondescript stalwart self as Tom. Raymond Burr, pre-Perry Mason, shows up as Thorwald and lends interesting ambiguity to his menacing character. Robert Burks' probing camera-work makes the perfect complement to Hitchcock's trademark film-making style, and special mention needs to be given to Robert A. Harris's splendid 1998 work in restoring the film's original splendor, even the slow-motion first kiss between Stewart and Kelly. The DVD has a couple of nice extras, an hour-long documentary that focuses on the ethics behind the story and the restoration effort, and a brief interview with screenwriter Hayes. One of Hitchcock's best in an impressive canon of work."
Prabhuraj,"May 8, 2019",9/10,A fantastic movie. Hitchcock at his finest. Jimmy and Grace are astoundingly brilliant in what is one of my favourite movies of all time.
FilmOtaku,"Mar 8, 2004",8/10,"Rear Window is considered one of Hitchcock's classics, and is probably Jimmy Stewart's most famous Hitchcock Role.  Stewart plays an adventure-seeking photographer who is laid up for seven weeks in his apartment with a broken leg.  During this time, he has become vicariously involved with his neighbors; looking out his rear windows and following their lives.  As the final week of his incapacity begins, he begins to suspect that one of his neighbors has killed his wife, and pretty soon his girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and nurse (Thelma Ritter) realize that he may be right.I seem to get more out of Rear Window the older I get  there are subtleties to the relationship, and to the lives of the other apartment dwellers that I catch as an adult, and didn't when I was younger.  One thing that has remained a constant however is the methodical pacing and the slow tension that builds up to outright terror.  I get just as tense and nervous during the last ten minutes of the film as a 30 year old as I did when I first saw the film at age 10.  It is only as I got older that I realized the helplessness of Stewart's character, and how important that element was to the plot along with its contribution to the uneasiness of the film.I've heard more than once that people have been bored during this film  of course, that is an opinion and cannot be judged, but I find it hard to relate to that, as I believe that even without the elements of suspense, Rear Window still makes a great story and film:  Which is just one of the many reasons it remains one of my favorite Hitchcock films to this day.--Shelly"
moonspinner55,"Oct 30, 2005",8/10,"Exceptionally likable movie about a desperate killer and his secret murder, yet also one about the bond of friendships and the camaraderie which arises in the face of exciting danger. Photographer James Stewart, laid up with a broken leg, gets to know the neighbors in his housing complex--by watching them all day out his back window (it's a sticky hot summer and everyone has their lashes up). This Alfred Hitchcock thriller gets off on the wrong foot by introducing Stewart's love-interest, Grace Kelly, rather clumsily. Kelly is supposed to look out of place in Stewart's rumpled apartment, with her designer dresses and Park Ave. manner, and we're meant to see that they are possibly an inappropriate match; however, Kelly's character wounds too easily, and the argument that ensues between she and Stewart isn't convincing. Luckily, she's allowed to warm up soon after, and she's wonderful when teamed with Thelma Ritter as Stewart's sharp little nursemaid. Ritter, in one of her best roles, keeps score on all that's going on and soon all three are involved in some mysterious doings happening across the courtyard. Dandy yarn has one of the most satisfying wrap-ups for a Hitchcock picture, and three fine actors who really get into these roles. It's squirrelly and suspenseful, quite amiable and masterfully done. ***1/2 from ****"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Nov 20, 2004",10/10,"While Psycho is still my favorite Hitchcock film, this comes very, very close to that. Having only seen the made-for-TV remake starring Christopher Reeves, I was quite excited to see this, as it's referred to by many as one of the(if not the) greatest Hitchcock thriller. Now, while I still prefer Psycho over this, I must say that it's a very well-done and effective mystery-thriller, and most of the second half had me almost biting my nails from suspense. The plot is very good, and its theme appeals to some of the most base instincts, including the tiny little voyeur that we all have. The pace is great, I was never bored during any point of the movie. The acting is great, Stewart and Kelly give excellent performances. The characters are all well-written, credible, and, as they almost always are under Hitchcock's direction; very human. The cinematography is excellent; most of the camera angles are from inside the main character's apartment, which creates a very effective and scary feeling of claustrophobia and adds to the suspense. The mystery keeps you guessing throughout the movie, but the ending seemed a little like a letdown... there's no definite answer to the mystery. Then again, maybe that was Hitchcock's intention... to any true mystery, there is no real answer. And Hitchcock probably wanted to have each viewer make up an answer for him- or herself. The film has some great suspense, and a few of the scenes will have you sitting at the edge of your seat. The ending was very close to being anticlimactic, but it managed to make up for it by having one of the most thrilling and nail-biting endings in a Hitchcock film ever. The main reason I rate Psycho higher than this on a personal scale is that the theme works better there... the killer is more easily understandable, while here he's just... well, sloppy and arrogant, half of the time. That was my one complaint while watching the movie, and it won't bring down my rating, not even a notch, because I'm positive it was the way Hitchcock intended it to be. His characters are always human, and what is more human than failing? I recommend this film to any fan of thriller, mystery and/or Hitchcock. You won't be disappointed. Great film. 10/10"
Theo Robertson,"Nov 29, 2005",6/10,"I was really looking forward to seeing to seeing Alfred Hitchcock's REAR WINDOW because of the massive acclaim it's had from film critics , and when I say "" film critics "" I mean everyone from the professional journalists who have their own columns in broadsheets to people with real jobs who contribute their own amateur - But by no means amateurish - comments on this website . In fact much my desire to see this movie was down to the it being listed at number 14 on the IMDb top 250 movies list , so I stayed up late last week to watch it on television where it was broadcast at the ungodly hour of 2am and I'm afraid I was bitterly disappointedMaybe it was the fact that it was well past my bedtime that I could hardly keep my eyes open but it could have been down to the fact that this is one slow moving thriller and the more I think about it the more I start to think that the screenplay was originally written for radio ! The action is very static with Jeff Jeffries lying in bed recovering from an accident looking into a courtyard that is obviously a pastel coloured studio stage . I wasn't expecting explosions and car chases but I was expecting exciting plot twists not a film where the hero spends all day in bedIs Jeff really a hero anyway ? How would you react to someone who likes to watch pretty young girls sunbathing all day ? And instead of the always likable James Stewart playing the role how would you react if the part had gone to a lecherous bald middle aged man with glasses ? That's right you'd react like one of the villagers from a FRANKENSTIEN movie and lead a torch carrying mob to burn down Jeff's apartmentI won't go into the plot but I will warn anyone who hasn't seen it not to expect very much . It's far from a masterwork of cinema and doesn't contain the director's imaginative visual style as seen in VERTIGO , the unsettling atmosphere as seen in THE BIRDS or the blackly comical twists as seen in PSYCHO"
saadanathan,"May 23, 2020",6/10,"First of all, the whole movie being around one room in an apartment can be really hard to focus and even enjoy the film. Are the audience expected to sit for an hour looking from the window on neighbors and traking the murderer? Can't the characters go outside off the apartment and go to other locations? (I mean more film locations). If this whole movie reminded me of how Hitchcock ""blocks a scene"", this was even worse cause there is nothing much to see or expect when the characters are ""trapped"" in a four room wall for an hour of a movie. The acting was decent and there isn't much about the characters for the audience to be attached to them. The only good thing in this movie was probably the opening sequence and the introduction to James Stuart's character."
gnperuti,"Sep 2, 2024",10/10,"Movies like Rear Window perfectly show that you don't need a ton of expository dialogue to tell a good story. You can simply let the setting, camerawork, and actions of the characters tell you all you need to know. The film does an exceptional job of showing the development of the various residents of the apartment building the whole movie takes place in by simply showing their day to day lives and how they change/stay the same throughout. All this is done with very little dialogue, other than occasional commentary from Jimmy Stewart meant to give us an outsider's perspective. Helping this is the fact that, with the exception of a couple of scenes, all of the apartments are shot from outside and afar, as if from within Stewart's apartment, which is the only one we are ever in. Not only does this give us a ton of great shots, not only does it really help put us in his POV, but it helps make the mystery at the center all the more interesting and intense, an intensity that only increases in the final act, leading to a pulse pounding climax.Despite how iffy it is for Stewart to play a romance with a woman half his age, he and Grace Kelly (who actually seemed to make a career out of love stories alongside men old enough to be her dad) have incredible chemistry, helped by their extraordinary performances. Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey are great as the two friends of Stewart helping with the investigation. And the neighbors, despite, of because of the lack of dialogue, all do great jobs too, especially Raymond Burr as the suspected villain.Overall, while I haven't seen every Alfred Hitchcock movie, Rear Window may very well be my favorite of the ones I have seen; either this or Psycho. It's certainly one of his best jobs as a director and a storyteller, and it definitely earned him the title of master of suspense."
Soumyadeep9190,"Oct 13, 2025",9/10,"Watching Rear Window again after so many years reminded me why Alfred Hitchcock is still called the greatest director of all time. The first time I saw it back in 2018, I enjoyed the story and the suspense. But rewatching it now in 2025, I could finally understand the deeper layers of psychology that Hitchcock weaved into this simple yet brilliant setup.The film is a masterclass in storytelling through limited space. Almost the entire story unfolds from the viewpoint of one apartment window, yet it never feels dull. Instead, it pulls you in completely. You share the same curiosity, boredom, and paranoia as Jeff, the photographer stuck inside his room. Every time he looks out of his window, we feel like we are spying with him. That feeling of being both the watcher and the watched is where the real tension lies.What I love about Hitchcock's direction is how he builds suspense not by showing too much, but by making you imagine everything. You start guessing. You start suspecting. You start questioning what's real. It's not just a murder mystery... it's about human nature itself. How we observe others, how we judge them, and how curiosity can turn into obsession.James Stewart gives one of his most natural performances here. His frustration and helplessness make you genuinely connect with him. Grace Kelly's presence adds a perfect balance of charm and emotional strength. And the chemistry between them feels effortless.Even after seventy years, Rear Window feels fresh, relevant, and timeless. It proves that great cinema doesn't age... it just becomes richer with time. For me, this is not just a movie about a man watching others. It's a mirror showing how easily we all become voyeurs in our own way.That's the beauty of Hitchcock. His films are not just thrillers... they are psychological studies wrapped in suspense. And that's exactly why I'll always call him one of the greatest filmmakers to ever live."
kaaffilm,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a masterful suspense film that has stood the test of time. Released in 1954, the movie still holds up as a classic example of the power of visual storytelling. The film stars James Stewart as L. B. Jeffries, a photographer who is confined to his apartment with a broken leg. Bored and restless, Jeffries spends his days watching his neighbors through his rear window. But when he becomes convinced that one of his neighbors has committed murder, Jeffries finds himself in the middle of a dangerous investigation.The film's strength lies in its simplicity. Hitchcock keeps the action confined to Jeffries' apartment and the surrounding courtyard, which creates a sense of claustrophobia and intensifies the tension. The film's pacing is slow and deliberate, allowing the suspense to build slowly until the final, thrilling climax.Stewart delivers a standout performance as Jeffries, perfectly capturing his character's frustration and growing sense of dread. The supporting cast, which includes Grace Kelly as Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa and Thelma Ritter as his nurse Stella, is equally strong.But what really makes ""Rear Window"" stand out is Hitchcock's skill as a visual storyteller. The film is filled with carefully crafted shots that reveal just enough information to keep the audience engaged and guessing. Hitchcock uses light and shadow to great effect, creating a moody atmosphere that perfectly complements the film's suspenseful tone.Overall, ""Rear Window"" is a classic of the suspense genre and a must-see for fans of Hitchcock and cinema in general."
kevin_robbins,"Aug 28, 2021",10/10,"Rear Window (1954) is currently available on Prime and tells the tale of a photographer who is stuck home after an accident leaves him injured. He becomes obsessed with watching his neighbors out of his windows and avoiding marriage with a perfect girlfriend. When he suspects his neighbor of cheating and about to leave his wife he notices he starts acting funny. Then one day something horrible seems to have happened and the neighbors wife seems missing. Could he have killed her and plans to escape or is it just the photographers imagination? This movie is directed by Alfred Hitchcock (Psycho) and stars James Stewart (Vertigo), Princess of Monaco 🇲🇨 Grace Kelly (To Catch A Thief) and Thelma Ritter (All About Eve). The acting in this is out of this world as James Stewart and Kelly play off eachother well and portray the evolution of their characters throughout the film perfectly. The script is excellent as you'd expect from Hitchcock and the intensity of the events - both across the street and within the relationship are well depicted. Grace Kelly continues the list of blond bombshells Hitchcock targeted as actresses that were both gorgeous and over the top talented. This entire movie is essentially on one set and is still so good. The scenarios that unfold during the peeping Tom moments are fun and the ending is intense and well executed. This is a Hitchcock gem that is a must see and a solid 9-9.5/10."
yankeesjrnc,"Oct 22, 2024",N/A,"Reading the reviews of people who didn't appreciate this movie, I am struck by the complete void that must exist in their brain where there is supposed to be some semblance of artistic appreciation, intelligence, and creativity.Bill Hader and Conan O'Brien brought me to this film, based on their endless love and support for the film. It does not disappoint and is a tour de force for how to make an ambitious, fantastic, and exciting film based on the smallest possible premise - a man stuck in a room.Not to beat a dead horse, but I struggle to comprehend how much of an idiotic Luddite you must be to not understand how good a film this is.""The shots are repetitive"" because Hitchcock was the first director to use these shots, which became so iconic, they were copied everywhere. This film was made in 1954 and has shots that would be at home in 2024. That is how ahead of his time Hitchcock was with his directorial style.Truly a lesson on how to take the smallest possible premise for a plot, a man stuck in his apartment, and spin it into a deep, evocative, and compelling story about a murder mystery.The Golden Age of Hollywood has plenty to complain about, but this film is indicative of a bygone era that we can only hope to return to. We just don't have directors like Hitchcock anymore, able to create a film so ahead of its time.If you are whining and complaining about not understanding this movie, maybe go back to watching the Fast and the Furious movies, maybe that is more on your level. Considering that excellent writing, directing, and production don't seem to be your forte."
mickman91-1,"May 4, 2022",10/10,"There is something about Rear Window which for me is the pinnacle of the Hitchcockian energy of suspense and intrigue. The whole film feels like you are sharing in the voyeurism and the mystery and suspense of what is happening. The best Hitchcock film in my opinion, even if Psycho does have more iconic moments/elements."
ccthemovieman-1,"Dec 9, 2005",8/10,"As far as I know, this is a huge favorite with older folks. Kids of today would be bored to death with this famous Alfred Hitchcock film.I went on a bit of a roller-coaster ride myself regarding how I viewed this movie. When I first saw it on the big screen as a kid, I was fascinated and almost terrified at the end. Years later, watching it twice within five years on VHS, I found it boring with Grace Kelly's dialog annoyingly corny and dated. Recently I viewed it again - a fourth try - and absolutely loved it. Next to Psycho, it's now my favorite Hitchcock film.Yeah, it's still dated quite a bit, and, in future viewings, I might fast-forward through a couple of talky parts with Kelly or Thelma Ritter. I would prefer to stick with the focus of the story, namely Stewart's voyeurism and suspicions of what is going on in Raymond Burr's apartment. That storyline is entertaining and builds tremendous suspense. Stewart is usually fun to listen to, anyway. Kelly is there for looks.Speaking of dated, can you imagine all the people in the apartments keeping their blinds open all the time, and Stewart keeping his door unlocked all the time as well, and people entering without bothering to knock first? True, it was more trusting and safer world back then, but it couldn't have been THAT transparent and trusting. Give me a break!Yet, credibility aside, it's so involving and fun to watch that who cares if doesn't make a lot of sense?"
chiragrathod09,"Jul 16, 2024",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window,"" released in 1954, is a riveting exploration of voyeurism, human curiosity, and the fine line between observation and invasion. Set against the backdrop of a sweltering New York City summer, the film invites viewers into the confined world of L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, portrayed by the charismatic James Stewart, who finds himself immobilized in his apartment due to a broken leg.As Jeff recuperates, he becomes increasingly fascinated with his neighbors through the rear window of his apartment. This seemingly innocent pastime soon spirals into a suspenseful investigation as he begins to suspect one of his neighbors, played by the enigmatic Raymond Burr, of committing a crime. The film deftly captures the isolation of city life while simultaneously revealing the depths of human curiosity and the darker impulses that can accompany it.Hitchcock's masterful direction creates an atmosphere charged with tension, using the confined setting to heighten the conflict and suspense. The film takes place almost entirely within Jeff's apartment, yet it never feels limited. Each window tells a story, depicting a tapestry of diverse characters that, together, illuminate the intricacies of everyday life while building an underlying sense of menace.The cinematography, helmed by director of photography Robert Burks, uses clever framing and perspective shifts to engage the audience, mirroring Jeff's own observations. As the narrative unfolds, viewers are drawn deeper into the mystery, caught between the thrill of seeing and the ethical dilemmas of spying on others.James Stewart delivers a compelling performance as Jeff, embodying the character's charm, frustration, and sense of moral ambiguity. Grace Kelly, as his girlfriend Lisa Fremont, is equally captivating, providing a counterpoint to Jeff's cautious antics with her own adventurous spirit. The chemistry between the two adds a delightful layer to the film, blending romance with suspense as they navigate the tension between action and inaction.""Rear Window"" is not just a suspenseful mystery; it also serves as a commentary on the nature of observation and the complexities of human relationships. It poses questions about watching others and the motivations behind our curiosity, challenging viewers to consider the ethical implications of such actions.Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is a masterpiece of suspense that expertly combines tension, character study, and ethical reflection. The film's exploration of voyeurism and its implications resonates powerfully, making it a timeless classic that continues to captivate audiences. With its brilliant performances, engaging direction, and thought-provoking themes, ""Rear Window"" remains an essential entry in the canon of exemplary cinema.All in all, a must see for those who are fans of Hitchcock. 9.0/10💥"
awm-77697,"Feb 15, 2018",6/10,"Rear window is such a unique and interesting movie. It is one that almost stands alone in its plot and camera angles and things of that sort. During the first twenty to thirty minutes of this movie it was almost extremely boring and I kept constantly asking myself the same question over and over again, which is ""are they really going to keep the camera in this one room for the whole movie?"" I kept on telling myself that the camera would probably move sometime soon and they would change scenery sometime soon, but that time just never came. Throughout the film it took sometime for me to actually accept the new movie style that Hitchcock portrays in this film. 
 During this film I went through almost 3 different stages of interest. The first stage consisted mostly of confusion and trying to figure out what was going on as they were introducing the different characters and scenarios. It was a very new movie feel for me so it took time to get used to. The second phase for me was unfortunately boredom, as I couldn't really engage into what was being played out in the different apartments. It wasn't until the end of the movie, about the time when the dog is found dead with its neck snapped that I really started to enjoy and became engaged in the film. The ending was very engaging and was extremely well done. It created an excellent sense of tension and suspense that I think engages every single viewer. During the whole process of watching the movie I can't really say I enjoyed it at all but once I looked back on it and realized the different cinematic elements and styles I came to appreciate it and understand it more.
 I definitely have a strong bias here because I was born into a generation of such great quality cameras and such good editing and animation. For this reason it can be really hard for me to engage in older movies of this style. Nonetheless this movie was very interesting to look back on and see how Hitchcock portrayed the characters in such an interesting way. It was so different and cool to basically see people as non-actors but just as every day people. You really get a sense of this when the movie is portraying someone in their everyday life without them supposedly knowing that they are being watched. You see the pureness of every shot. This film really enacts a different feeling in the viewer, as it is something were really not used to seeing.
 Overall I cant really say that I enjoyed this movie to much as I found it slightly boring and un-engaging. There are many great cinematic elements that make it very different and interesting. The whole stationary camera sense was just two different for me and I was able to really appreciate and enjoy the movie very much."
toberwino,"Feb 15, 2011",4/10,"I had heard a lot about this film so was really looking forward to seeing it. I watched it in the company of my wife and her sister and at the end all three of us felt the same about it as my review below. I found it a huge disappointment - it trundled along at a slow pace and I kept waiting for something to happen which would be thrilling or suspenseful etc - typically Hitchcock. I am still waiting. I kept wondering, if someone is a professional photographer with a massive telephoto lens at his disposal, why did he not take any photographs. Isn't that what voyeurs do? Also, could someone tell me the purpose of the back massages - I am no masseuse but there seemed to be no rhyme or reason to them. This movie was a horrible waste of my time."
hipchecker20,"May 2, 2022",8/10,Great Hitchcock film!A NYC so different from today. Great characters. Enjoyed seeing Grace Kelly becoming the woman that James Stewart wanted to marry.Thelma Ritter's word were always spot on.But I wonder why Jimmy didn't lock his door when Perry Mason came to see Him?
Leofwine_draca,"Apr 22, 2011",9/10,"A taut, intelligent script and two wonderful performances from the leads make REAR WINDOW another of Hitchcock's masterpieces. The story, about a wheelchair-bound man witnessing a murder is the kind of simple, single-set setup that Hitchcock loved best and he makes full use of the premise by ladling it with humour, suspense and all kinds of tension. Stewart and Kelly make for an irresistible double act and the murder plot is delightfully dark and full of menace.While it doesn't feature the kind of intricate plotting that makes DIAL M FOR MURDER my favourite Hitchcock yet, REAR WINDOW is nonetheless an iconic and influential high concept thriller and a real one off."
Ready4disJelly,"Feb 1, 2023",10/10,"Rear Window is a perfect film. I wrote my thesis on it at university and I've watched it probably more than any other film. It's absolutely stunning and shocking how much it achieves without an actual film soundtrack or musical score.All the sounds you hear come in from the open window. It it a lesson in editing and pacing. A masterclass in how to build suspense without relying on music. This is far and away, in my opinion, Hitchcock's best work. His masterstroke. Though other movies in his catalogue get more attention, this one should be required viewing for every young horror filmmaker. Even though it lands far less in horror and more in maybe a crime thriller genre, a young filmmaker can learn so much about how to build suspense and pace a scene in all genres.10/10. If you haven't seen it, watch it."
fernandoschiavi,"Mar 26, 2022",8/10,"Hitchcock transforms what could have been a simple police investigation into a more complex operation, which holds the viewer's attention until the end of the film, wanting to know what the end of the plot will be. This is, above any story that can be explored during its narrative, a declaration of love for cinema and a tribute to the spectator. Just as Jeff inserted himself into the lives of strangers, trying to decipher their secrets, dramas and complexities, the movie viewer puts himself in the same role; the role of observer. When we watch a movie, we are in precisely the same position. We see, we accept, we create scenarios and we try to decipher the mysteries, even without ever being fully involved in the story.In fact, we never got to know Jeff's neighborhood, we just saw it with our eyes. We look for features and draw maps that can lead us to doom, but in fact, the whole denouement is built through a distant look; a gaze that does not insert itself into the presence of the characters and, when it does, risks danger (I'm talking about a scene in which Lisa tries to discover one of the great secrets of the plot). Generally, in Hollywood, it's the protagonists who move the action. That make the pieces of the puzzle slowly fall into place as the film progresses. But in Rear Window, that doesn't happen. It is under Jeff's watchful eye that the whole world built there by Hitchcock develops, and the main character never goes beyond such a secondary plan that the neighborhood itself could lead the film.Jeff's window overlooks a set of interior courtyards surrounded by other buildings and this is an absolute highlight of the set design work. Shot entirely in a studio at Paramount, Rear Window relies on this carefully constructed set, which represents a microcosm of society. And, together and in this context, this magnificent setting is a living character in the narrative, entirely built in just one month on the studio's soundstage 18, after an intense study of how it should be.Of course, everything is dependent on the point of view of the narrative, that is, from where Jeff sees his limited world, as all the action takes place inside his apartment or is seen from his apartment. Also, as he is obliged to always remain seated, we see the camera at half height and therefore all the action - and the scenery - has to be seen from this exact angle. Jeff's world is connected to that of his neighbors, but separated by an invisible barrier of seeming individuality that is slowly demolished by Hitchcock's indiscreet camera representing the photographer's own camera and, ultimately, our will and curiosity to know what happens. In the lives of others. Every detail of the set is created thinking about this prison imposed on the protagonist.From the beginning, it is easy to see the director's skill in working with images as the main source of narrative construction. It is a sequence in which we are introduced to the neighborhood where the entire plot takes place, and then to the protagonist. The cast on his leg with the inscription ""Here lie the broken bones of L. B. Jefferies"" already makes it clear who he is and what state he is in. Soon after, a broken camera and photos from an accident reveal what he does and what happened to him. This contributes greatly to the pacing of the film, since the first act resolves such explanatory questions in the first sequence, providing time to develop the character from the moment his actions directly affect the course of the story.The pattern of camera movement from this first sequence is repeated several times throughout the film: a pan showing the neighboring apartments, then a pullback showing Jeff and revealing where this view is coming from. The option for this constant is perhaps one of the greatest merits of Hitchcock's direction in the work because at the same time it establishes a narrative cohesion, serving as a support point for the entire plot, it refers to the meaning of the protagonist's own practice of observation/espionage. . This is pointed out in one of the scenes where Jeff talks to his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly), as they both look out the window at their neighbors. It's as if each resident is a projection of some internal conflict in Jeff's: the pianist who lives alone represents the kind of life he craves, with freedom and detachment; the newlywed couple harkens back to their constant discussion with Lisa on this topic; to ""Mr. Lonely Heart"" represents his fear of being alone and unhappy for the rest of his life if he doesn't marry Lisa; and the ballerina, a beautiful young woman who lives surrounded by men, is how Jeff imagines his girlfriend's life to be. Thus, it is not for nothing that the camera always retreats into the protagonist's apartment after a walk through each of the other people's windows, as if they were internalized.Never leaving the setting of Jeff's apartment to tell about the disappearance of Mrs. Thorwald, Hitchcock - who makes one of his usual flashpoints here too - rarely takes the risk of framing the neighborhood from angles that suggest a departure from the main scenario, which it is, after all, his captive's armchair, and as such must not be left until the riddle is solved. This one, contagious, much more because of the interest we have in seeing our ""detective"" discover the truth than for the truth itself of what is happening in the window of the Thorwald couple. Between one peek and another, Rear Window presents us with mesmerizing dialogues about the ethics of being able to see other people's lives and search their secrets through their windows, openings that provide only broken images of the truth on that side. Which, in a deeper study, could open up a complex debate about how the way we see an image can change our perspective on its content, which would inevitably lead to a discussion about the information industry, biased journalism, etc. Just one more proof that well-made cinema remains current and relevant, even sixty years after it was made.Rear Window has a great script very well written and well tied together that uses the effects of loneliness and anxiety in a person's life to masterfully create an atmosphere of suspense, doubt and paranoia in the midst of a very simple premise story, where throughout the narrative we find ourselves constantly wondering if everything is real or just imagination. Along with the protagonist, we are invited to observe everything that happens in this neighborhood with its characters of different characteristics and with their certain routines. It's amazing how a script where its narrative develops in a single environment can be so rich in details and manage to attract the audience's attention, with new layers being inserted into the scene all the time. The level of immersion is absurd and very well done, giving us the feeling of being another character within the story who also observes everything and everyone. There are several moments in which the audience smiles, is surprised and apprehensive along with the protagonist and those around him, since everything happens through his point of view. Hitchcock, with his genius and ability to tell a good story and create a good atmosphere, manages to engage the audience with naturalness and simplicity to a degree that few can.As the film progresses, along with the protagonist's need to prove his convictions, we find ourselves tied to a dialogue between him and Lisa, where she points out how much they were so concerned with proving they were right and not even worried about it. The life of the alleged murdered victim.However, it is at the climax that Hitchcock shows his true mark. The tension built is based on the traditional development of two simultaneous and interconnected events, much worked by D. W. Griffth in the beginnings of the seventh art: something bad is about to happen while salvation rushes to prevent it. However, in Griffith, this tension is constructed by revealing both events through parallel montage; Hitchcock, on the other hand, chose to focus attention only on the tragic event that is about to happen - also to keep the entire film in the same environment, the neighborhood -, but without failing to provide the viewer with information that people are on their way to this situation to prevent it. . This makes the event even more tense, as we don't know how close or far these people are.Still in this sense, the only moment other than the climax in which the point of view leaves the apartment in some shots is in the scene of the dog's death. Afterwards, the owner of the animal accuses the neighbors of having killed him and talks about how they should like each other instead of committing such acts. The camera is not oblivious to the character's drama, daring to compose more closed shots that show the faces of some of the supporting actors, previously seen only in open shots. Perhaps this is the most important scene in the film, as in addition to serving as a turning point for the plot, it dialogues with the spectator himself through criticism of a society that evolves in an increasingly individualistic way. This is evident at the end of this sequence, when everyone who has gone out to the balcony of their apartment and listened in surprise to the dog owner's monologue simply returns to their tasks as if nothing had happened.This is a manipulative and provocative thriller that uses the effects of loneliness to bring to life a story surrounded by mysteries and doubts. With an excellent script, good performances and a quality production, the film is the result of yet another brilliant work by Alfred Hitchcock's direction, which shows why he is considered to be one of the greatest filmmakers that cinema has ever seen. A work that deserves to be seen even if only once by any self-respecting movie lover. Full of twists, suspense and drama, Rear Window is one of those films you never forget!"
bob the moo,"Mar 28, 2005",N/A,"Jeff Jeffries is an adventure photographer for a major newspaper who, thanks to an attempt to get an action shot during a motor race, has found himself in a plaster cast spending his days and nights in a wheelchair. His only visitors are his carer Stella and his beautiful, but pressurising girlfriend Lisa and the majority of his time is spend staring out the window into the courtyard area of his apartment complex. It is during one typically hot night that he spots something funny going on inside one of the apartments opposite his  the woman of the house seems to be gone and the man is acting suspiciously; from the confines of his chair, Jeff keeps watch, with the case becoming increasingly clear to him and his friends.Despite having themes in common with many Hitchcock films, this stands out as being one of a couple of his movies that are accessible and entertaining to a wider audience. Using voyeurism as its central theme, the film takes us into a fairly straightforward mystery that is well told but also laced with subtexts and other windows to stare through. To me this makes it a better film because there is much that intrigued me about the characters and the neighbourhood while also providing me with an engaging mystery. Modern audiences who have seen this film copied and referenced countless times will doubtless struggle to see what the fuss is about and perhaps they are right as the story doesn't have the twists and turns that are considered the norm now in a lot of thrillers; but it is still strong enough to keep the interest. The voyeuristic nature of the characters is interesting  with them changing throughout the film; meanwhile the many lives on display in the other flats provide other things to be interested in as well.Of course a massive part of it working is the cast. Stewart plays his usual ""aw-shucks"" personae to good effect but crosses it with a certain lack of ethnics and a less than wholesome character who spends his nights with a young girl who he doesn't want to commit to and an unhealthy habit of staring at his neighbours. Kelly is sexually innocent and seductive with it  unlike Hitchcock I tend to find blonde princesses all a bit dull and obvious but she worked here. Stealing most of her scenes is sterling support from Thelma Ritter, not that different a performance from some of her others but still very well timed and blessed with some really great lines. Burr is rather stiff but at a distance it doesn't really matter and he does well enough. The various other neighbours each works well with their mini-stories that barely exist within the film but do add to the layered effect of the film.Overall the film is classy and the rich colours and ordinary setting are nicely in contrast with the action of all the main characters. The mystery is well delivered and engages in a gently dramatic fashion while the starry cast are impressive and interesting throughout. For my money not as pound-for-pound entertaining as North by Northwest but still one of Hitchcock's more widely accessible films if not quite one of his best."
kosmasp,"May 3, 2020",10/10,"No pun intended of course. The movie itself sets up the stage (again with a likely pun) and where we're going to spend most of our time. We are as confined as the main character here. We see what he sees and we may react similar as he is. Adding visitors and strange neighbors, who all have something going on ... it makes you wonder what is going on next door? And that is one of the things Hitchcock displays here.There are many stabs (at marriage, human nature, sanity etc) and it is even more relevant to some I reckon during a lockdown/pandemic. Not entirely claustrophobic, but also quite contained in the world it is showing us. Men can be mad and certain circumstances will bring the worst out in them. The movie depicts so many ticks and character traits you could easily write novels about it. As it is, you can also just enjoy it as the thriller that it is"
roddekker,"Jan 8, 2017",6/10,"I don't know about where you live - But in the 14-storey building that faces the building where I live in Vancouver, BC - I'd say that less than 20% of its tenants actually keep their curtains wide-opened all the time.And, of course, this was not at all like it was in ""Rear Window"" where, literally, everyone was, pretty much, parading around in front of their windows (except for the bashful newlyweds) without any care, or concern, in the world that the guy across the courtyard was not only using binoculars (but a telescope, as well) to observe their private activitiesAnyway - With that said - I thought that this 1954, Alfred Hitchcock thriller was fairly entertaining. Its story did build quite nicely to its adrenaline-charged climatic finale."
ma-cortes,"Feb 10, 2015",8/10,"Alfred Hitchcock awesome intrigue/comedy in which a magazine photographer seeks diversion in watching his neighbors , often with a telephoto lens and binoculars , discovering a possible murder . Thrilling flick with funny moments , nice acting , adequate settings and funny dialogue . The tale is ordinary Hitchcock fare that plays and preys the senses . It involves a bewildered as well as hapless wheelchair bound photographer (James Stewart) because of a broken leg who spies on his neighbours from his apartment window and becomes convinced one of them (Raymond Burr) has committed murder his spouse and dismembered the body . The photographer soon enlists the help of his high society fashion-consultant sweetheart named Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly), his visiting nurse called Stella (Thelma Ritter) and a Detective (Wendell Corey) to investigate the weird deeds .This agreeable and often hilarious picture from master of suspense has a memorable scene after another and was one of the main Alfred Hitchcock films made for Paramount . In fact , at the time the set was the largest indoor set built at Paramount Studios . The entire picture was shot on one set, which required months of planning and construction . The film was shot quickly on the heels of Dial M for murder (1954), November 27 1953-February 26 1954 . Alfred Hitchcock's movies have become famous for a number of elements and special iconography : vertiginous height , blonde bombshells , voyeurism , long non-dialogue sequences , a matter of mistaken identity etc . This charming as well as inventive mystery movie has these particularities ; furthermore contains a fun intrigue , amusing situations and keeps the action at feverish pitch . The first part of this production is slow and artificial ; however , the rest of this suspense picture takes off at high speed . Interesting and intriguing screenplay adapted by John Michael Hayes based on a story by Cornell Woolrich . Screenwriter John Michael Hayes based Lisa on his own wife, who'd been a professional fashion model when they married . The original story by Cornell Woolrich had no love story and no additional neighbors for L.B. Jeffries to spy on, and those elements were created by Alfred Hitchcock and John Michael Hayes . Alfred Hitchcock's movies were known for featuring famous landmarks and he also was known for making his actors follow the script to the word, and in this movie the characters use their dialogue taken from an engaging as well as fun script . Very good acting by the great James Stewart as as a photographer who soon becomes convinced that one neighbor has killed his wife and Grace Kelly as gorgeous and elegant girlfriend , both of them make a marvelous duo . Grace Kelly made three of her eleven films with Hitchcock; this film, as well as Catch to a thief (1955) and Dial M for murder (1954), but Rear window film was thought of as the best . Excellent support cast such as Thelma Ritter , Wendell Corey , Kathryn Grant , Frank Cady and Raymond Burr . And of course , Hitch cameo , about a half hour into the film, winding the clock in the songwriter's apartment. Colorful and glimmer cinematography in Vistavision by Robert Burks , Alfred's ordinary cameraman , showing nice images from studio . The film negative was considerably damaged as a result of color dye fading as early as the 1960s , nearly all of the yellow image dyes had faded out. Despite fears that the film had been irrevocably damaged, preservation experts were able to restore the film nearly to its original coloration . Rousing as well as atmospheric score by the classic composer Franz Waxman .The motion picture was stunningly directed by maestro of thriller Alfred Hitchcock . The film was unavailable for decades because its rights were bought back by Alfred Hitchcock and left as part of his legacy to his daughter. They've been known for long as the infamous ""Five Lost Hitchcocks"" among film buffs, and were re-released in theatres around 1984 after a 30-year absence. The others are The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), The rope (1948), trouble with Harry (1955), and Vértigo (1958). This essential and fundamental Hitchcock will keep fascinated and thrilling right up until the edge-of-your-seat climax . And the American Film Institute ranked this as the #48 Greatest Movie of All Time and ranked #3 on the American Film Institute's list of the 10 greatest films in the genre ""Mystery"" in June 2008."
ryancrazylegsmcgee,"Mar 1, 2004",7/10,"Rear WindowPicture this: You're all alone in your apartment, dancing in your underwear when you suddenly stop cold.  The little hairs on the back of your neck stand on end, and you get the feeling that someone is watching you dance the night away through your window.  Well, before you call the cops and tell them you have a peeping tom, why don't you wave at them because your peeping tom just might be...Jimmy Stewart.Yes, Jimmy Stewart likes to look through peoples windows when they're in their underwear in the movie `Rear Window'.  And to tell you the truth, he does a pretty good job of it too.  Jimmy played a character named Jeff who was confined to a wheelchair in his apartment as a result of a broken leg. He was perfectly cynical, and his idleness, and curiosity of other people's private world was his downfall.  Jeff was like a stereotypical house wife who gets caught up in their `stories', or soap operas.  Jeff was becoming more and more absorbed in the private worlds outside of his rear window until he was finally sucked into that world in the shocking conclusion. Jimmy Stewart played this character with strength and established Jeff's cynicism, stubbornness and his meddlesome tendencies.But the viewer wasn't always paying attention to Jimmy and his paranoia, because there was often times something a little easier on the eyes on the screen.  The beautiful Grace Kelly played opposite of Jimmy Stewart.  Even though her beauty was undeniable, she was more hypnotic than anything else. It was in the way she delivered her lines with such, dare I say, grace.  Her parents weren't kidding when they named her after beauty.Hitchcock used his resources to create beauty in every frame that appealed to all five senses and most emotions also.  And even more amazing is how he filmed the whole movie out of the little apartment, and made it both an interesting story which built to a fantastic crescendo, but his cinematic genius was also stimulating to the mind.  Hitchcock created visual metaphors of Maslow's Hierarchy of needs and of basic, raw humanity.  He accomplished this with his set that had a apartment building that symbolized the human state, with the rock bottom sad people in the lower apartments and the happy people in the top floor apartments.Hitchcock's film `Rear Window' had many levels much like his metaphorical apartment building.  And from every angle there was something to appreciate in this movie.  It captured beauty, it captured humanity, it reflected raw and polished life.  `Rear Window' is in every sense of the word `art'."
Lechuguilla,"Feb 21, 2006",N/A,"When the issue is a fifty year old ""classic"" that others rave over, the easiest thing in the world is to go along with the crowd, and proclaim the film a ""masterpiece"". You've got lots of protective cover.But I, for one, do not like this film, and I don't mind saying so. First, the film's theme is unethical. Many people equate Jefferies' voyeurism to an audience watching a movie. Such a comparison ostensibly makes the voyeuristic theme harmless. But filmmakers make movies specifically to be watched. By contrast, most people at home value their privacy, and would not like some neighbor from across the street spying on them through binoculars. In this film, Hitchcock gets away with it because the guy doing the spying is played by a famous, and beloved, actor named James Stewart.The second problem is the film's contrived plot. The timing of Thorwald's activities with Jefferies' spying is way too coincidental, for my taste. And without Thorwald's activities, you don't have a story. Further, Thorwald conveniently leaves his windows open to view, behavior that is not believable. For that matter, how believable is it that any of those neighbors would leave their windows open to view, in such a tight, claustrophobic setting? And without those open windows, you don't have a story.My third objection is the film's lack of suspense and lack of plot twists. I do not consider this film to be a thriller at all. It's more of a social commentary on nosy neighbors.Most viewers would pounce on a film whose theme is unethical, or would jump all over a film that has obvious contrivances, or lacks suspense or plot twists. In the case of ""Rear Window"", however, viewers ignore the film's flaws, because the film has Hitchcock's name attached to it. And so, we have a double standard. The standards are fairly low for films directed by Hitchcock. A much tougher set of standards apply to films made by other directors."
frankde-jong,"Apr 21, 2022",8/10,"Jeff (James Stewart), the lead character of ""Rear window"", is immobile because of a broken legg. During this period he starts spying on his neighbours in the appartment building opposite of his house.There is little doubt that Alfred Hitchcock wanted to make it very clear to the moviegoer that there is a strong resemblence between him/her and the voyeurism of Jeff. Just like Jeff has a big choice of appartments to spy on, the moviegoer can choose from a broad supply of movies. Just like Jeff can't intervene in the lives he is spying on (because he is immobile), the moviegoer is also incapable of changing the end of the film he is watching. The overall point is that while watching a movie you are looking at the lives of others, who can't look back. Viewed this way, watching a movie is a special kind of voyeurism.I already mentioned that Jeff can (and does) spy on a lot of apartments. Because each apartment has its own story ""Rear window"" takes on the character of an ensemble film. This is easily overlooked because one story (the murder mystery) is very dominant.Nevertheless the character of ensemble movie is important. Very often ensemble movies do have some element connecting the different stories. In ""Rear window"" this connecting element is the relationship between Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly). Lisa is pushing for a more serious relationship. Few men would hesitate when Grace Kelly would be pushing them, but Jeff has fear for commitment. In the different stories different aspects of a married life (positive and negative) are illustrated."
jared-25331,"Oct 12, 2024",10/10,"I just got done watching Rear Window (1954), arguably one of if not Alfred Hitchcock's greatest movie, for the first time ever and I safely say that this movie is indeed one of Hitchcock's best as well as one of the greatest movies ever made.Positives for Rear Window (1954):
Now on its surface, this movie is a simple story that has been done many times after this movie's release and the only other movie I've seen to tackle voyeurism was The Voyeurs (2021), the Amazon Prime Original Movie starring Sydney Sweeney. However, the main thing that separates this movie from those others is of course the masterful direction and execution by Alfred Hitchcock. The atmosphere in this movie is by far the most intense and thrilling in any Alfred Hitchcock movie. I also really really enjoyed the movie's setting of the apartment in the Chelsea-Greenwich Village region of Manhattan and this might the best simple settings in any movie ever made. Throughout the runtime, you are sitting there wondering if our main character is either crazy or if he is telling the truth about one of his neighbors committing murder and the movie has your attention throughout the runtime. Of course, it goes without saying that the cast in this movie give phenomenal performances with James Stewart as L. B. Jefferies, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Thomas J. Doyle, Thelma Ritter as Stella and Raymond Burr as Lars Thorwald just to name a few. The dialogue and banter in this movie is by some of the best I've ever heard in any movie. The movie also does a fantastic job at throwing twists and turns at the right moments and it raises the stakes and tense for the rest of the runtime. And finally, the climax of this movie is one of the most intense and thrilling finales I've seen in any movie ever made.Overall, Rear Window (1954) is a cinematic masterpiece for the ages, it is my second favorite Alfred Hitchcock movie and it is one of my favorite movies of all time."
wumbi,"Dec 10, 2021",10/10,"So much suspense for a movie that laid everything in plain view, it's honestly impressive how Hitchcock can pull this off. James Stewart delivers a stellar performance. Grace kelly's performance is also not inferior to her beauty. Considering how this was shot from one room the cinematography is amazing, they're all varied so it never got boring to see. One other thing that keeps this movie alive is the dialogue, it's like every character is trying to outwit each other when they talk and it was really fun to watch. The story itself is simple yet Hitchcock was able to snuck in some suspense in it. The kind of suspense where it gave you satisfaction when the movie ends."
ahmadmherat-93045,"Dec 27, 2021",9/10,"Its one of the best movies I've ever seen in my whole life, no wonder Alfred Hitchcock is so popular even after more than 60 years, what I see in this movie not just a story there are a lot of stories he would tell me by one room, with great messages about love, others life. I saw these stories by JEFF'S eyes only."
celestestamenkovic,"Apr 8, 2018",10/10,"This movie is exteremlely intense and suspenseful.
In my opinion this movie is a masterpiece and deserves its place in cinema history."
deleyshaun,"Jul 7, 2025",6/10,Rear Window revolves around wheel chair bound bachelor ( Stewart) who spies on his neighbours. He suspects foul play from one of them ( Burr) and gets his lover ( Kelly) and helper ( Ritter) to investigate. The themes of ' murder next door' and voyerism were land mark at the time and have had many rip offs since. The chemistry between Kelly and Stewart is a bit odd but they pull it off. There is also the sure hand of Hitchcock' direction which is clear to see here. The last 25 mins or so revs up the suspense to a fitting climax. It hasn't stood the test of time as much as some of his other works but is nevertheless worth a watch.
vishalmellark,"May 6, 2023",10/10,"In ""Rear Window,"" Hitchcock creates a visual masterpiece that explores the human desire for voyeurism and the consequences of making assumptions. By limiting the audience's perspective to Jeff's point of view, Hitchcock immerses us in the confined world of his apartment and creates a sense of claustrophobia that heightens the tension. James Stewart delivers a nuanced performance as the bored, yet curious photographer, while Grace Kelly's character adds a layer of sophistication and mystery. The film's use of color and lighting, particularly in the final sequence, adds to the already stunning visual aesthetic and reinforces the themes of morality and justice. ""Rear Window"" is a true masterpiece of cinema that has stood the test of time and will continue to thrill and captivate audiences for generations to come."
preppy-3,"Feb 23, 2000",5/10,"I love Hitchcocks' movies--he was undoubtedly one of the greatest directors of our time--but what's the big deal about this movie.  It's well-directed (obviously) and the acting is good, but the story is predictable, the dialogue dull (except for a few of Thelma Ritter's wisecracks) and it's just plain boring!  Also I can't seriously accept the fact that someone as beautiful and classy as Grace Kelly would fall in love with Stewart.  He's old enough to be her father!  So, I don't see why everybody loves this film, and I consider it one of Hitchcocks' lesser works."
tonypeacock-1,"May 11, 2023",8/10,1954 Alfred Hitchcock directed mystery thriller. Have you ever been annoyed at nosey neighbours? I have. However this film alters your perception at what constitutes being nosey with your ethical obligations to report a serious crime.The plot concerns a temporarily immobilised professional photographer LB Jeffries (James Stewart) who is confined to his apartment after having a leg in plaster cast after a work accident. During the long summer days stuck in the apartment he bides his time watching the neighbours in the apartment court. He becomes increasingly agitated and suspicious at the disappearance of a bedridden neighbour. The wife of a salesman neighbour Lars Thorwald. Jeffries ends up escalating his suspicions to his girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter) along with a police detective friend Tom Doyle. Jeffries suspicions and theories begin to take over his daily life it seems. Nosey neighbour becomes obsessive compulsive disorder sufferer!As the film progresses the guilt of Thorwald becomes clear despite the police officer's reservations leading to an action packed (this is 1954) finale. The film has received worldwide plaudits and is rated as one of Alfred Hitchcock's greatest films. The film explores such human behaviours as voyeurism and sexism (male dominance). The film is simply made on one studio set enormous as it must have been. Director Hitchcock really was a genius.
steiner-sam,"Dec 21, 2022",9/10,"It's a mystery set in the early 1950s in one room in a Manhattan, New York, apartment. It follows the observations and conclusions of a photojournalist laid up for six weeks in his apartment because of an accident.L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies (James Stewart) is a widely-traveled photographer laid up with a large cast on one leg. In the entire film, he's in a wheelchair or bed. Three people come to see him. Stella (Thelma Ritter) is his visiting nurse, and Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) is his fashion model girlfriend who wants him to settle down and be a commercial photographer. His third visitor is his old friend, Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), a police officer who was a pilot with whom Jeff served during World War II.Jeff spends all his time looking out his rear window at the apartment windows across the courtyard. We get a glimpse of all their foibles. Jeff is particularly interested in Lars (Raymond Burr) and Emma Thorwald (Irene Winston). Lars is a salesman, and Emma appears to be a chronically-ill housewife. Emma suddenly disappears, and with the help of binoculars and his camera's telephoto lens, Jeff begins to make conclusions about what happened to Emma. We learn the truth at the film's climax.""Rear Window"" is probably my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film. I enjoy photography, which helps me to identify with Jeff. The storyline is straightforward, and the twists and turns all make sense. Some of Lisa Fremont's actions seem out of character for her personality, but she has totally bought into Jeff's theories. Thelma Ritter helps provide a little comic relief. ""Rear Window is a well-executed film based on a solid story."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 26, 2023",8/10,"Before the aptly named Raymond Burr became Perry Mason, he generally played bad guys on the big screen with regularity. He is superb in this role. Jimmy Stewart has a leg up on him, however, as the protagonist in this highly entertaining Hitchcock thriller. As peeping tom Steward is stuck in his non-air-conditioned room with a broken leg, he faces several apartments only a few feet away via his binoculars. He, of course, views the beautiful women in various stages of undress, but accidentally also views a crime in progress. A man is murdering his wife! And worse than that, the killer can see that Stewart can see him. How will Jimmy survive the killer from coming to silence him? For that revelation, you must see the film. Good viewing."
Michael_Elliott,"Feb 27, 2008",N/A,"Rear Window (1954)**** (out of 4)Alfred Hitchcock's smart and sexy thriller remains one of the greatest of the genre. James Stewart plays a man confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg who spends all day and night spying on his neighbors. The biggest thing going in his life is his nervousness of his relationship with a rich woman (Grace Kelly) but that's about to change when he thinks one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) has killed his wife. Here's another film that probably would have been a disaster had anyone else in the world directed but Hitchcock brings his normal brilliance to the film making it one of the greatest ever made. This film has countless layers so it's impossible to catch everything on one viewing, which is why I think the film gets even better with each new viewing. The way Hitchcock has Stewart spy on all the neighbors is something brilliant and we get to know and care for each of them, which pays off greatly towards the end of the film when we're worried about the ""lonely lady"" while forgetting to watch Kelly who has snuck into the neighbors home. I've read several reviews that says the film moves too slowly and perhaps this is true but on repeat viewings it's clear that Hitchcock is just setting a trap for the viewer, which leads to a really suspenseful ending. There's no question Stewart is a brilliant actor and while I haven't seen all of his film I might put this at the best performance of his career. Sure, he was brilliant in Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, It's a Wonderful Life and various others but he has to do all his acting here in a wheelchair so his facial expressions, voice tones and other small items have to be used throughout the film. How deep of a character he's able to deliver is something not too many actors could do. Grace Kelly is great as well as is Thelma Ritter adds great comic support. Raymond Burr never gets mentioned but he's terrific in the film as well."
UltraNeptuneCat,"Jul 15, 2025",7/10,"Most of the film is talking, I always thought the main suspect would see him at any point. And thirdly, Im glad they were able to re bring to life this almost forgotten film. I thought the neighborhood was so lively every second I thinkt hey brought their families and neighborhood to life each person, you carefully watch with them. Best not to try this in real life though. I think these folks were lucky not to of died and in th emiddle the detective had me convinced for a little but they were making things up and that everything was just unusual because they were watching so closely at everything he did. But also he touch that purse for no reason a lot."
erikegelkraut,"Oct 3, 2016",9/10,"Throughout the film, the director gives excellent shots to portray the characters emotions through visual means rather than speaking it aloud. As well as this you get a glimpse into several people whose homes are arranged behind his. Actor James Stewart gives a compelling performance as well. Showing both emotion and feeling through his being stuck in a cast and missing out on his normal adventurous lifestyle.While some scenes lack in interest and absurdly long focus on the dancer whose main character choice is bending over, this does show how his inability to live how he enjoys puts him in a state of boredom and often lust for the outdoors, and of course companionship.That paired with a script that is fit perfectly to the theme I'd say this film is worth the watch for any movie lover. I give Rear Window a nine out of ten rating."
martinpersson97,"Jan 7, 2023",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of the best and most influental directors of all time, whether we're talking about his early British flicks or the more well-known Hollywood epics, his shadow looms over filmmaking for all time.This movie, without a doubt one of his best, is a great example of his achievements as an artist. Like many other incredible, but hard to make films, it tries to use almost nothing, one location and a very limited number of characters. Hitchcock, the master or suspense, proves how well he can handle it. It's one of the most unique and suspenseful films ever made.The actors all do an incredible job, and Hitchcock's usual characteristic cinematography is astounding as always.Overall, truly a cinematic masterpiece!"
maddmaxx46,"Dec 11, 2024",9/10,"This was a fantastic thriller that started slow but by the time it was done, I was on the edge of my seat. It begins with a normal apartment scene with Stewart as the main character but the way Hitchcock was able to slowly introduce the entire apartment block through world-building was so well done and paced. I wanted to know more about each set of neighbors and Hitchcock did an amazing job having each apartment play off each other simultaneously. Stewart and Kelly were a fantastic duo in this one and were able to have great chemistry in some scenes but perfect tension in others. The cinematography was also top-notch but had some limitations due to the time it was shot having not developed the technology yet. It's not a masterpiece to me since it felt like a couple of scenes were drawn out a bit too long with dialogue but it didn't kill the pacing either. 4.5/5 stars."
oOoBarracuda,"Oct 26, 2016",9/10,"My years-long quest to see everything Alfred Hitchcock has ever made finally lead me, albeit far too late, to Rear Window. Hitchcock's 1954 feature starring Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly has been revered and countlessly referenced in the 62 years since its release. The film in which a wheelchair bound photographer with nothing better to do than look out the window of his New York apartment at his various neighbors becomes convinced that one of them has committed a murder. Bringing together a brilliant display of the various lives that make up a neighborhood and how each human effects the other, Rear Window was a long overdue treat.After injuring himself on a photo shoot, L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) is wheelchair-bound with a broken leg. Since Jeff is single, for the most part abhorring the idea of marriage, the only interaction he enjoys throughout his long days are the visits of his caretaker, an occasional guest, and his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly). In order to help the time pass as he recovers, Jeff has taken a liking to watching his neighbors from his large apartment window. Living varied lives, each with their own schedules and idiosyncrasies, Jeff becomes entranced learning more about their lives behind his binoculars. Among his watching, Jeff notices a traveling salesman with a bed-ridden wife at home. He watches him take care of his wife and begins to learn his schedule. One day, Jeff notices that salesman's wife has disappeared and his schedule has drastically changed. The collection of oddities has Jeff convinced that his neighbor has killed his wife. Jeff is so convinced that he shares this belief with his girlfriend and caretaker, who initially dismiss him, then go on to help him. With no proof, the threesome hatches a plan to implicate the neighbor with murder by entering his apartment, even if it costs them their lives.Now I understand why I like the film Disturbia so much. I saw the 2007 version of Rear Window first, and was stunned that I liked it so much, being as I am no fan of Shia LaBeouf's; after seeing Rear Window, however, I can appreciate my liking of Disturbia more as it is basically a remake of the Hitchcock classic. I was initially disappointed to see that Rear Window was a color film, for some reason I thought I remembered that it was in black and white, but I got over it quickly when I first saw Jimmy Stewart; really, is he in anything that's not completely splendid? I really enjoy watching films by British directors, as I love the emphasis on dialogue within the films. Rear Window, had a wonderful emphasis on dialogue and the three principles delivered the lines quite well. There was a great deal of fun effects throughout this film, including the fun way Hitch filmed through the lenses of Jeff's camera and binoculars. Rear Window is a fantastic example of a distinction Hitch himself was sure to make; he made suspense pictures, not mysteries. It really doesn't matter to the film whether or not the man actually killed his wife, what is paramount, however, is the quest endured by the actors to find out whether or not Jeff's neighbor is a murderer. Another gripping suspense from the ultimate master in the genre, it is easy to see why Rear Window is the classic it has become."

Very good set and lighting, without forgetting the role of Grace Kelly, always elegant and very pretty. One of the best movies of the magician of intrigue and suspense.Although more than 60 years have passed since its release, Rear Window is one of the best preserved films and occupies a prominent position in Hitchcock's filmography, and I can say that it is one of my favorites.James is one of my favorite actors in Hollywood, in this movie I love how he acts. The production is incredible, how they handle the light and the small space to film."
cariart,"Aug 16, 2003",N/A,"One of the joys of Alfred Hitchcock films is his ability to take social taboos, present them in an enticing context, throw in major stars we know and respect to perform them, and thus make abhorrent behavior seem attractive! 'Vertigo' is the best-known example of this Hitchcock trait ('Psycho' also comes to mind), but 'Rear Window' is arguably the most fun to watch, because of the appealing combination of James Stewart and Grace Kelly.Stewart is a photographer, laid-up while recuperating from an accident (cleverly shown through photographs in his studio), who, out of boredom, begins spying on his neighbors through binoculars. Virtuous Jimmy Stewart a 'Peeping Tom'? Only Hitchcock could get away with this!Of course, Kelly, as his high fashion model girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter (who is fabulous as his nurse), are appalled by Stewart's behavior, but are drawn into voyeurism by Stewart's devotion to it, particularly after he witnesses an apparent murder (committed by Raymond Burr, in one of the most wonderfully EVIL roles of his career).The film takes on a cat-and-mouse intensity, as Stewart attempts to prove Burr's guilt to his skeptical policeman buddy (nicely played by Wendell Corey). To add a touch of sexual foreplay to the proceedings, Kelly models a variety of '50s evening and nightwear, while teasing the injury-constrained Stewart (""Previews of Coming Attractions"", she purrs). All this leads up to a fabulous, claustrophobic finale, with camera flashes, and a twist ending that is pure Hitchcock magic.If you haven't seen 'Rear Window', run, do not walk to your video store, and rent it! You'll quickly discover why it is one of Alfred Hitchcock's most popular films!"
esteban1747,"Sep 15, 2002",7/10,"This is another good thriller of Hitchcock. James Stewart, as usual, was the selection as a leading actor together with the then nice Grace Kelly, always efficient supporting actress Thelma Ritter, a solid acting of Wendell Corey, and the villain Raymond Burr, who later in his career became the famous actor of the detective Perry Mason. The best is that the thriller does not show any particular violent scenes until its end when the wheelchair journalist (Stewart) was caught in his activities by the guilty man (Burr). Notwithstanding with this, the film keeps you always awaiting for a final discovery of the supposed killer. So watching the film you have entertainment, you may see the people's life of 50s, and you enjoy with the plot of the thriller. Film-makers should see how Hitchcock did to delight everyone with a really simple plot."
MackDeBerry2004,"Dec 3, 2022",10/10,"Beautiful film, where do I even begin. The story has you on your toes the whole time, the cinematography is brilliant, the performances are fantastic, and everything about it is just enthralling. The fact that this whole film is basically shot from one location is an accomplishing feat on its own, the fact that you can make an almost 2 hour movie while staying in the same cramped apartment is beyond impressive. The camerawork is something to marvel, the frame within a frame shots are visual storytelling at its best letting the viewer experience these people's lives from the same perspective as our lead. A timeless classic, its age does not show one bit."
Okonh0wp,"Aug 13, 1999",7/10,"This is one of the best murder mysteries I've seen because of Hitchkock's artistry. Like 12 Angry Men, it's very simple. The simplicity is  used to Hitchkock's advantage. He draws up an intricate murder plot just from one scene. That deserves credit. It's an original and creative way to view a murder story. The acting was also great."
ricepoituna2w,"Jan 21, 2025",9/10,"Great Hitchcock classic - Jeff is an intrepid photojournalist whose daredevil dedication to his job has left him confined to a wheelchair in his small Greenwich apartment. With no television to alleviate his boredom, he takes to spying on the neighbors across the courtyard, getting to know them intimately without their knowledge. For starters, we've got Miss Torso, a young beauty who practices dancing in her restrictive lodgings. There's also a frustrated composer going through songwriter's block {where Hitchcock makes his obligatory cameo}; a young married couple christening their new abode as only honeymooners can; Miss Lonelyhearts, a desperately forlorn middle-aged spinster; a busybody neighbor; and an older couple with a terrier. But the neighbor who piques Jeff's interest most of all is Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr), a henpecked traveling salesman with a nagging invalid wife. Even without the binoculars {or even a high-powered lens} Jeff can see the tension between them as they bicker back and forth. She may be practically bedridden but she has enough strength to make her husband's life utterly miserable."
davidjkobb,"Jul 9, 2019",10/10,"In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made. At least, this is the best movie I've seen.I've never seen a movie with better dialogue, more engaging actors, better directing or more wit and charm.Grace Kelly is probably the most beautiful woman in the world, too."
jluis1984,"Dec 1, 2005",10/10,"Brilliant. Legendary. Perfect. There are not enough adjectives to describe properly ""Rear Window"". Along with ""Vertigo"" and ""North by Northwest"" this is probably one of his best 3 movies.After his period in Warner Bros., where he directed masterpieces like ""Strangers on a Train"" or ""Dial M For Murder"", it seemed as if the master could not top what he had previously achieved. But he did. In fact, when Hitchcock directed ""Rear Window"", his first movie at Paramount, he was beginning with the right foot what would become his most brilliant period.The well-known plot stars Hitchcock's favorite Jimmy Stewart as photographer L. B. Jeffries, who is almost caged in his apartment during his recovery from an accident he had while working. To kill the time, he becomes obsessed with what happens to his neighbors outside, to the point that he is convinced that one of them committed a murder. Grace Kelly plays his beautiful girlfriend, and Thelma Ritter plays his nurse.Hitchcock makes us parters in crime during Jeffreis voyeuristic adventures, as we are silent witness of the misfortunes of the neighborhood. Lisa, his girlfriend, has a difficult relationship with Jeffreis, there is definitely love there, but he is reluctant to include her in his life because he considers her ""too perfect"". Jeffreis voyeurism is probably, his escape to his problems as he prefers to watch the others.Technically the movie is brilliant. The camera is our eyes and it flows smoothly; and even when the movie takes place almost entirely in Jeffreis apartment, it never becomes tiresome or boring. This is also possible to the ingenious script and the brilliant performance of the three lead characters.Beautiful Grace Kelly is outstanding as the lovely girlfriend who turns into an adventurous spy as she gets interested in his boyfriend's new hobby. Jimmy Stewart gives once again his classic performance of the ""regular guy"" that Hitchcock enjoyed so much; although in my opinion, is Thelma Ritter who gives the movie that charming quality, as her witty comments are delivered with that dark humor that Hitchcock loved so much.""Rear Window"" is without any doubt, a perfect movie. Hitchcock has walked a long way, but all his previous work was practice when compared to the movies to come; his work would reach it's peak in the famous three: ""Vertigo"", ""North by Northwest"" and ""Psycho"". At this time, he is already considered a master.10/10. Masterpiece."
AlsExGal,"Jun 27, 2021",10/10,"... and if you ever want to introduce somebody to Hitchcock start here. Highly regarded and often spoofed, Hitchcock's ultimate ""cabin-fever"" thriller still knocks down imitators almost 70 years after its release.James Stewart is a photojournalist injured in the line of duty and holed-up in his studio apartment with a crippling leg break. Wheelchair-bound and longing to return to his previous adventure life, he spends his days and (hot summer nights) spying on the occupants of the apartments in his New York City alley courtyard, and manages to eye (via telephoto lens) mysterious neighbor Raymond Burr possibly committing (and cleaning-up after) the murder of his invalid wife. Stewart's haunting convictions about what he believes he saw, clash with the romantic agenda of long-suffering glamorous girlfriend Grace Kelly, who wants nothing more than to lure Stewart into a boring life in polite society, forcing him to give up his dangerous and inquisitive nature to settle down and start a family. A film full of suspense, sexy innuendo, a fabulous Franz Waxman score (be it partially recycled from some of his older films), and enough haute-couture Kelly threads to keep the pages of a vintage Vogue fully-dressed, this is essential viewing due to its timeless statement about voyeurism and suspicion - that what you think you know about your neighbors may or may not be stranger than what is actually going on behind closed doors.Of course the most unbelievable thing in the entire plot to a modern viewer is an insurance company nurse who makes house calls, does massages, and cooks breakfast in the person of wise cracking Thelma Ritter, but I digress. Highly recommended."
PudgyPandaMan,"Oct 8, 2008",8/10,"I have always been a huge fan of Hitchcok, after 1st seeing Dial M for Murder. Rear Window was probably the 2nd film of his I ever saw. I have since seen it probably 5-7 times and it never fails to keep my interest or cause me to see some new detail I missed before. I think that is the true measure of a Classic or Masterpiece, and this one certainly delivers! There are so many things going on in this movie, but most reviewers have touched on all of these so I won't add to them. But the plot is so superb in its layers of conflict, and studies in personalities of Stewart, Kelly, and all the neighbors. It is probably the best film for observing human nature at its many forms.I never realized how massive the set was until I dug a little further. They actually constructed the massive building in one sound stage. All the apartments in Burr's building had running water and electricity and could actually be lived in. Talk about realism and going the extra mile - but Hitchcock was all about that. All along I had assumed they had pieced the different scenes together to look like one building. At the time, it was the largest indoor set ever built by Paramount. While some may find the action a little slow as everything is filmed from the viewpoint of Stewart's apartment window, I find it amazing that the movie still creates such tension and suspense in spite of this.I think it is interesting that Spielberg is facing a lawsuit for his movie Disturbia which claims that it is basically a re-working of Rear Window. Why would anyone even attempt another telling of Hitchcock's perfectly done masterpiece, and especially without permission (even if your last name IS Spielberg)?"
WritnGuy-2,"Jul 17, 2000",N/A,"I saw this last night on AMC and was blown away by the plot, the characterization, the setting, and of course, the suspense. I am a huge Hitchcock fan, some of my favorites being ""North by Northwest,"" ""Psycho,"" ""Lifeboat,"" and now this.L.B. Jefferies, known as Jeff by his friends, is wheelchair-bound in his Manhattan apartment, dealing with a broken leg. With nothing else to do but look out the window, he takes to watching the lives of his neighbors around the center courtyard: the struggling musician, Miss Torso, the dancer, the eccentric couple with the curious dog, the newlyweds, Miss Lonelyheart, and of course, the Thorwalds, right across the way. Lars Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife become Jeff's focal characters to observe...until Mrs. Thorwald disappears, and Lars becomes progressively suspicious. He quickly involves his uptown girlfriend, Lisa (Grace Kelly) who opts to do some investigation, and then involves his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Helpless in his apartment, he works through them and the moderate help from his friend, Doyle (Wendell Corey), a detective. Questions continue to arise, and Jeff, Lisa, Stella, and Doyle seem to be coming to a conclusion. Yet, this is Hitchcock, and our team of protagonists aren't close to just solving the case and moving on. Oh no, the last twenty minutes or so prove to unbearably suspenseful as Lisa investigates the Thornwald's apartment while it's unoccupied, and Jeff and Stella watch helplessly as Lars comes home....This truly is an amazing film. James Stewart and Grace Kelly give amazing performances, and Thelma Ritter is wonderful as the witty nurse. The vignettes on the lives of each of Jeff's neighbors are all quite interesting, and I found Miss Lonelyheart's story in particular to be absolutely wonderful. I also loved how Jeff was helpless, while the two women were off doing what one would think to be the man's role in the movie. Lisa, particular, is quite an innovative character. First of all, she's very funny. I love when Jeff is telling her the rough aspects of a traveling photographers life, and how when he asks her something in the way if she had ever been 5000 feet up, struggling to stay warm in twenty below zero weather, and she replies, ""Well, when I get a few minutes after lunch...."" She also takes that role of the elegant uptown girl and admits her sophistication and perfection, like when Jeff comments on how she never wears the same dress twice, and Lisa notes light-heartedly, ""Only because it's expected of her [me]."" And then, when she takes all those risks to uncover the truth in the end. Not only could I not sit still, I was so scared (which is rare for me with most horror movies) but I was amazed at how she proved that she wasn't afraid to risk anything. Now, that's one hell of a heroine, and perhaps the greatest Hitchcock woman ever.I also loved Stella. She had some of the greatest lines in the movie, and I love when she's commenting to Lisa and Jeff on the probable gory details of Lars's act. She was definitely memorable with all her witty lines, and had me laughing many times.And of course, James Stewart gave a great performance, conveying that feeling of helplessness, and near claustrophobia being in that apartment, unable to do anything, and just as he's safe in his apartment watching everyone, he goes through hell trying to figure out what to do when Lars comes home while Lisa is still at his apartment.The movie is enthralling from the amazing opening to the wonderful epilogue, and the title music totally sets the scene for some fun. I recommend this movie to anyone, it is an amazing film."
sol-,"Feb 11, 2007",10/10,"Made around the same time that televisions started to become an essential part of the home, 'Rear Window' paints an interesting time capsule of a society devoid of television, where the only entertainment if stuck at home all day is watching the neighbours' activities. In fact, 'Rear Window' could even be seen as a film about television, with Jeffries, the protagonist, switching views of other apartments just like a man constantly changing channels on his television set. As Thelma Ritter's character Stella says, ""We have become a race of peeping toms"", relating to a key issue of the film: the voyeuristic tendencies of society.Although it would not be made for another twelve years, the film bears a strong resemblance to 'Blowup', with Jeffries stating that ""right now, I'd welcome trouble"", an indication that his mind is overactive, searching for something interesting to follow. And with his detective friend, a character representing the devil's advocate, we are constantly hanging on the edge, weighing up the evidence for ourselves. We are also able to do more investigating than what the characters themselves conduct. In different windows, different events occur, some of which the protagonists note, and others of which we ourselves observe only.The cinematography helps a lot in serving this cause. There are at least a couple of shots that scan the courtyard and then go back into Jeffries' apartment. These shots at first appear to be taken from the perspective of the characters, but since they do not end on the characters looking out the window, Hitchcock establishes a separation between us and the characters. We are learning more about what is happening outside when they are distracted. The way we are introduced to Jeffries also probes us to investigate: first we see his leg, then photos of accidents, and only later do we realise that the photographs are of potential accidents, rather than photos of his accident.The opening shots of the film are amazing. Three blinds are slowly opened in the background as the main credits roll, just like how we are slowly opening our eyes as the film begins. Then the camera goes through the window, explores the courtyard, and finally ends up inside Jeffries' apartment, and on a perfectly focused shot of Jeffries. Another great shot is Lisa's first scene, where she kisses Jeffries in slow motion, almost as if it is a dream. The film is full of great shots and excellent camera-work, and to think - Hitchcock probably had to call most of those shots from the distance! It's a very fine directorial achievement.Speaking of Hitchcock, his cameo here serves more purpose than in any other film of his. Before Thorwald notices that he is being watched, Hitch is the only character to actually look back at Jeffries. And aside from that, it's quite interesting with the whole relationship that is then established between director, actor, film, audience: the whole chain that is controlling what we are seeing. If nothing else, Hitch's cameo reminds us that even though we see more than what the characters are see, we only ever see ourselves what he allows us to see."
Shortee16,"Mar 1, 2004",7/10,"`Rear Window' is an incredible mix of things; mystery, life lessons as lived within the perimeters of various stages of life, and romance. James Stewart portrays Jeff, an ambitious photographer who is temporarily on a wheelchair due to a work related accident. He believes to have witnessed a crime as he watched his neighbors' lives through the rear window of his apartment. The cinematography of Hitchcock's film is deserving of recognition, because it was the largest inside set of the time. The film's setting is inside Jeff's apartment throughout the duration of it, with one exception. Yet every single apartment watched through the apartment's window is so incredibly detailed and thanks to the filming allows the audience to capture all that goes on inside the far off windows. Hitchcock does an amazing job at carefully choosing the stages of life in which every one of Jeff's neighbors is going through. One woman is your typical lone heart; he gives us an aspiring musician, a ballerina, a newlywed couple, as well as a look inside a troubled marriage's apartment. These don't just stand for their clearly stated definitions, but also in a certain way reflect what Jeff's life is like. As he gives marriage a serious thought. Grace Kelly is portraying Lisa Carol Fremont, the woman Jeff is seeing and who represents an opposite of Jeff's character. She is rich and holds a high social status, and also deeply desires a commitment to Jeff. The chemistry created between Lisa and Jeff is reflected very well by the actors. Jeff is almost blinded to see the perfect woman throwing herself at him. The pace Rear Window starts off with is steady, yet seems to drag at about the middle of the film, making it hard for the audience to follow, again towards the end its faster pace is picked up again. This is recovered by the choice of inspirational and dynamic music continually played in the background of the film. Hitchcock demonstrates his geniality and incredible talent by the making of Rear window"
HenryHextonEsq,"Feb 5, 2001",10/10,"Yes, Rear Window is probably the film that has finally made me accept Hitchcock's genius. I loved ""Vertigo"", appreciated ""Psycho"", was irritated by ""Spellbound"", was partial to ""Strangers on a Train"", was intruiged by ""The Wrong Man"" and fairly enjoyed ""North By Northwest""... ""Rear Window"" is probably his finest work that I have yet seen... open, as it is, to many, varied interpretations.While ""Vertigo"" had a more domineering score, photography and general artifice, ""Rear Window"" has a greater impact for me. While ""Vertigo"" was gripping, this one was positively electrifying in that department. The fact that Hitchcock managed such a multi-faceted, intruiging effort with the original conceit he adopted - to make a film from one set, and one single vantage-point - is astounding. I've not heard of the novel it was based on, but this is one hell of a script. All of the characters, and that's partially including the ones viewed by Stewart's L.B. Jeffries, are fully fleshed out and flawed. I found Thelma Ritter's performance amusing, and believable, providing the Bel Geddes (in ""Vertigo"")-type role early on, and then developing interestingly. Grace Kelly's Lisa is a fascinating character, more than you'd initially suspect. Undeniably beautiful, but also frustrated, passionate, devious and desperate in equal part. While Jeffries, or perhaps his accident (a typically important little detail that Hitchcock uses brilliantly, like Stewart's vertigo in ""Vertigo""), starts the whole voyeuristic business, Ritter and to an interesting extent, Kelly collaborate with his fancies. Stewart's role is a great one, that of a deeply flawed, and disturbingly obsessed voyeur. It is sure that, at least with the films he made for Hitchcock, Stewart fulfilled all of his promise as an actor. From the wonderfully casual early scenes, to his gradual obsession with a particular house, his acting is brilliant in conveying the character's less-than-positive traits. It seems absurd at first that he be resistive at all to Kelly, but gradually their relationship is made complex, with perhaps Kelly's motivations in the film's later stages intruiging to consider, if she is or not as ""perfect"" as Stewart earlier claims. There is twist after twist in characterisation, theme and plot, with the final 15 minutes particularly striking in this regard. The conclusion is brilliantly ironic. Audience expectation and sympathies are toyed with exceptionally by Hitchcock at every turn. The themes are manifold, with voyeurism the guiding one. Themes are linked with character, and are effectively tackled; Wendell Corey's character pretty much emphasising the voyeuristic theme with a pertinent quote that I can't exactly recall.The direction is superb, as you would expect from Hitchcock (its his fascinating, complex use of narrative, character and theme that eleveates this work above so many of his other films), engendering many different moods, but none untainted by corruption in some way. The photography is impressive, giving the restricting settings a pungeancy. Hitchcock and his photographers always tending, at least with ""Vertigo"" and ""Rear Window"", to capture colour in a more vivid, expressive and importantly, atmospheric light than most in the history of colour film. Perhaps pivotal in my view is the brilliant use of music, distant, from the houses Stewart spies on, especially the haunting piano tunes (referred to yearningly by Kelly's character) from one home. This adds contrast and depth to many scenes, both within and without of Stewart's flat.It seems a waste that there are so few films that try, and succeed, in capturing this film's mood and devices. In many ways, I felt David Lynch's ""Blue Velvet"" to capture some of its suspenseful brilliance. Terence Young's 1967 film, ""Wait Until Dark"" was very nearly as tense and exciting, and also well worth checking out if you love ""Rear Window"". No doubts are there, that ""Rear Window"" is one of the ""classics"" more than deserving of its status. Rating:- *****/*****"
hitchcockthelegend,"Feb 3, 2009",10/10,"L.B. Jefferies is a wheelchair bound photographer who by way of relieving his boredom, starts observing the lives of all his neighbours from his apartment window. As he gets deeper into the lives of all around him, he becomes convinced that one of hem has committed the act of murder, thus putting himself and those close to him in mortal danger.Much like most of Alfred Hitchcock's other lauded pictures, Rear Window has been dissected, examined, appraised and written about by far more versed people than myself, a mere film fanatic. So how do I even start to write a review of a film that I view as one of Hitchcock's best? Well maybe I should just write what I like about it without delving into psycho babble and a deconstruction of the human psyche and all its little offshoots! So I will!.Rear Window is adapted by Alfred Hitchcock and his writer John Michael Hayes, from the Cornell Woolrich story called It Had To Be Murder/Murder From A Fixed Viewpoint. The film of course forces us the viewers to become voyeurs, watching a newly hooked voyeur go about his business. Quite a neat trick from Hitchcock, and one can reasonably assume that the maestro director was chuckling with glee within his genius girth.Working from the confines of a single set, Hitchcock has molded a suspenseful, intriguing, cheeky and sexy picture, with a top line cast giving the smart screenplay the performances it deserved. What is often forgot by those more concerned with the psychological aspects of Rear Window is the blatant irony of L.B. Jefferies situation, his obsession with the neighbours is not confined to a probable case of murder, his interest first and foremost is with the love lives of those he observes, thus forcing (excusing) him to acknowledge the love from the woman who so wants to be in his life!It's also important to note the merits of each character of the piece, those that visit Jefferies and the conversations that take place, even the suspected murderer has a bemused interest pouring from his very frame. Rarely has a film been produced that has every single character having a critical element to the story. Then there is the ending where Hitchcock and his team weave all strands together to leave us wryly smiling away whilst simultaneously feeling that we have been had by the big director, and be under no illusions here, we have been at the mercy of a genius and party to a film of unquestionable quality. 10/10"
mullermike,"Mar 2, 2005",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock is without a doubt the king of suspense. I have been a fan of his for many years, so I knew I had to see this movie. Needless to say, I wasn't disappointed.POSSIBLE SPOILERS ********Jimmy Stewart is great as LB Jefferies, the cranky photographer who's wheelchair bound in his apartment with a broken leg. To pass the time, he begins playing Peeping Tom on his neighbors. Good thing there are some interesting characters around. There's the gorgeous ballerina, who loves prancing around in her undergarments, the party hardy pianist, the couple that sleeps on their fire escape (I love when it rains on them) and the volatile salesman with a bed stricken wife. Things get even more interesting when Jefferies starts to think the salesman has murdered his wife. He's going in and out of his place on a cold, rainy night, and the wife is no longer in bed, where did she go?Jefferies asks for the assistance of friend and former Air Force buddy Detective Doyle (Wendell Corey), who unfortunately, thinks he's crazy. Not to worry. Even though he won't fully commit to her, Jefferies is able to enlist his beautiful, sociable, and all around perfect girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) to do his dirty work. Being the fearless type, she's willing to take more risks than Jefferies imagines, a move that almost gets her killed and lands her in jail. Of course, Jefferies soon puts his own life at risk, which leads to the one action sequence in the movie (which is kind of cheesy and dated).One thing that was unique about Rear Window is that the whole film was shot in the same location, from Stewart's apartment. Hitchcock, not only good with suspense, is also able to do some fascinating camera work. Those shots of Stewart holding his camera are innovative and show how talented he was. I have to say, I don't think movies like this could be made anymore, for it isn't action packed. The mood slowly builds up until you have the final confrontation. No high speed chases, explosions, anything of that nature, just old fashioned suspense. The acting by Stewart and Kelly is wonderful and they had a great on screen relationship, even if Stewart's character is oblivious to the idea of love (how could you be if you had a woman like Grace Kelly)?If you're a person that loves blood and guts, plot twists, fast paced action, then do not see this movie. Many from Generation X and Y (which I am a part of) would be bored by this flick, but if you appreciate good film making and suspense, go see it, and you'll understand why Hitchcock gets so many accolades to this very day."
RNMorton,"Feb 15, 2004",10/10,"I didn't really know much about this movie until the 90's and never made it all the way through until the last few years. Now it's a high-priority selection. Action photographer Stewart is injured and confined to the rear porch of his modest Manhattan apartment, which overlooks a courtyard and many other units. He thinks he sees a murder, or is his under-stimulated mind just imagining things? It's so good you don't even realize that the camera is (just like Jimmy) grounded on Stewart's back porch. Kelly is great as the dedicated love interest and Ritter equally so as Stewart's nurse. Stewart is about twice Kelly's age and pretty much looks it, just the same there is a certain chemistry between the two. A pre-Mason Raymond Burr is effectively scary as the suspected killer. 10 out of 10"

k-09931,"Mar 30, 2020",9/10,Rear Window: A classic Hitchcock masterpeice that slowly builds from start to finsih in thrilling form.
zkonedog,"Mar 11, 2017",9/10,"Psycho or Vertigo might be the most identifiable Alfred Hitchcock films. North by Northwest his most visually stunning. Shadow of a Doubt was the Master's personal favorite. Rear Window perhaps doesn't eclipse any one area of those classics--but its tremendous cinematography and thematic relevance keeps it fresh some 70 years after it debuted at the cinema.For a very basic overview, Rear Window sees photographer L. B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) laid up with a broken leg--nothing to do but stare out the window at the activities of his city-dwelling neighbors. One such individual (Raymond Burr) in particular arouses the interest of Jeffries due to his strange behavior and disappearing wife. At first, things seem relatively harmless and one isn't sure if Jeffries isn't perhaps taking suspicions a bit too far. But when Jeffries' girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly) gets pulled into the proceedings, the drama is ratcheted up another level.First and foremost, Rear Window shows just how far ahead of the game Alfred Hitchcock was compared to other directors of that time. In a 1950s Hollywood prone to B-pictures or variety show-style ""something for the whole family"" flicks that did little more than draw maximum crowds, Hitch proved with Rear Window that a true thematic and character masterpiece could be produced for the big screen.It doesn't hurt that the acting here is phenomenal, with Stewart and Kelly having a chemistry perhaps unmatched in the rest of the Hitchcock canon. Cary Grant's Hitchcock offerings may have been glitzier, but Stewart's everyman acting chops allow for more performance depth. Even Burr's antagonist--despite almost no dialogue--is memorable.In terms of cinematography, I'll call Rear Window Hitch's outright best worked. Paired with frequent DP Robert Burks, the duo produce a film cut that is a sight to behold on the big screen. Every scene is filled with interesting movement or visuals and not an ounce of any frame is wasted. Again, mind-boggling to think this was created in 1954.About the only criticism I have of this film--dropping it from 10 stars to 9 --is that it might be 15-20 minutes too long. The build-up is superb and the climax is thrilling, but there is a period in the middle where both the character development and plot motion sag a bit. In a film otherwise so expertly constructed, this ""sitting in neutral"" is apparent.But for the most part, that is mitigated by the relevance of the film's overall themes. Though originally constructed as commentary on tenement housing situations and their cramped quarters allowing for voyeurism, Jeffries' peering into other lives while neglecting his own is just as relevant in, say, the social media era. When Thelma Ritter says ""we've become a race of peeping Toms--what people ought to do is get
outside their own house and look in for a change"", it is a true punch to the gut. That, to me, is the reason why Rear Window can still play in theaters nearly three quarters of a century after its premiere."
jwanichek,"May 19, 2018",9/10,"This movie really is a thinker. It keeps you going the whole time, never a dull moment! Hitchcock's directing is phenomenal in this thriller starring Grace Kelly and James Stewart. The way Hitchcock uses shadows and scenery in this film is in like any other."
aradford57,"Nov 3, 2022",10/10,"Stewart & Kelly are just perfect for this film. He's a rugged, go anywhere photographer imprisoned in his small flat due to a broken leg. Kelly a beautiful society girl who's trying to refashion him as a society fiance. And never the twain shall meet until Stewart suspects there's been a murder in a neighbouring flat. Which unites the couple as they investigate the gruesome crime.Apart from the two human stars huge credit must go to the fantastic set and musical score provided by the neighbours radios, record players and pianos.Hitchcock keeps the direction tight and very edgy. Kelly's visit to the murderers flat is still nail bitingly tense.One of Hitchcock's very best."
smvlowrider64,"Mar 15, 2006",10/10,"I always loved Hitchcock's ""Psycho"", so when i found out we would be watching ""Rear Window"" in my college film class i was excited. Surprisingly i didn't know much about the film, and had never seen it before. It is so much fun to watch a classic for the first time. The movie is so full of suspense it keeps you on the edge of your seat until the very end.When ""Jeff"" (James Stewart) continually spies on his neighbor believing him to be a murderer, the plot thickens. I love mysteries, and i wasn't sure throughout the movie if i also believed there had been a murder, or if i thought maybe ""Jeff"" was just paranoid. Hitchcock uses great elements to build the suspense, such as POV (Point of View) shots that really make you feel for the protagonist. He is seemingly helpless stuck in that wheelchair of his. I also loved how Hitchcock not only included the story of the upstairs neighbor, but also of many other neighbors surrounding the courtyard. Downstairs, Miss Lonely Hearts was also an object of ""Jeff""s voyeurism.This film was interesting for 1954, an era when peeping tom's were not accepted, much less as the ""hero."" It broke down barriers by showing women ""spending the night"", and dancing around in their underthings. This film has definitely become a new favorite of mine, and i would recommend it to any movie-buff's out there that haven't yet seen it."
ilovedolby,"Jun 1, 2003",N/A,"Rarely does a motion picture come along that is so genuinely intense that it sends cold chills down one's spine. This was a knack that late director Alfred Hitchcock immersed his films in-particularly, `Rear Window.' Starring the late, great Jimmy Stewart and the gorgeous Grace Kelly, `Rear Window' is a spine tingling film that leaves the audience guessing and one the edge of their seat. 	L. B. 'Jeff' Jeffries (Steward) sits in his apartment, stuck in a wheel chair with a broken leg after photographing a car accident. He's been there for nearly seven weeks and all he does is watch out his apartment's back window at the other tenants in their apartments across his backyard. All seems normal until one night he hears a scream and notices that in one apartment, a woman who was sick in bed is no longer there. And her husband, a salesman, has been leaving the house late at night. Jeff suspects the man has killed his wife, but can't prove it. Jeff's story seems contrived and silly to his nurse, a close friend, and his girlfriend Lisa (Kelly). But clues soon turn up that will leave these characters forever changed.Hitchcock masterfully directs this classic from 1954. The one astounding aspect of `Rear Window' is that it all takes place inside Jeff's apartment. The camera never leaves the room, except to occasionally pan around the exterior of the backyard. Also, Hitchcock sets up interesting characters in each of the apartments. There are the newlyweds, a woman who is an artist, a woman who is a dancer, a man struggling with writing music that will sell, and another woman who is so distraught from lonliness that Jeff refers to her as Miss Lonely Heart.' 	The performances of `Rear Window' are some of best ever captured on celluloid. Naturally, Stewart can't touch a film without turning it to gold with his down-to-earth appeal. Kelly lights up the screen with her beauty and intriguing nature. Thelma Ritter is witty and engaging as Jeff's nurse, Stella, who provides her own insight into the relationship of Jeff and Lisa, but also into the possible murder. Wendell Corey plays Thomas Doyle, Jeff's friend who is an investigator. He gives his own explanation for the disappearance of the man's wife-she could have gone to visit family, or left him. And lastly, Raymond Burr plays Lars Thorwald, the man whose wife goes missing. Burr is terrifying in his portrayal as the strange salesman.All in all, `Rear Window' proudly takes its place among the top 100 movies of all time from the American Film Institute (AFI). It's certainly one of the best movies ever made not so much because it has the ability to terrify its audience, but because of the brilliance in the filmmaking by arguably the greatest director of all time, Hitchcock. `Rear Window' is available for rental at local video stores. ****"
vithiet,"Jul 8, 2023",8/10,"I knew it was a classic and that Hitchcock is a master of his art but I did not expect to be so thoroughly engaged and entertained by this movie. While it's undeniable that everything about it makes it a product of the 50s, it's also eerie how much of it feels like it could easily be a contemporary movie with just small changes. Or in other words, from the story to the pacing to the characters lives and motives, it is not aging badly at all. But I have to confess that even though I am 70 years too late, I just fell in love hard with Grace Kelly... I swooned every time she was on screen! Just another reason to highly recommend this movie!"
Shilo_R_A,"May 31, 2022",7/10,"Rear Window is considered to be amongst Hitchcock's best films by many critics and fans alike. Its name is said with the same breath as Vertigo (which I love) and Psycho (which I'm yet to see), but either way you get the picture, pun intended. High expectations, that in the most TL;DR fashion I'll tell you that weren't met, though I do consider this film to be a good one.Rear Window is about this photographer guy, Jefferies, who can get out of his house for quite a while now since he broke his leg while doing his job. Anyway, this film has two main layers, I'd say.One is the way that Jefferies decides to spend the time he's grounded looking out of his window and watching the lives of his neighbours from a safe distance. He even gives them nicknames - Miss Lonelyhearts, The Salesman, Miss Torso. You got the idea. Surely but slowly he's getting pulled into the lives of others, cannot stay uninvolved as he obeserves something very peculiar.The second is his troublesom romance with young Lisa Fremont, a girl who's ""too perfect"", to quote Jefferies himself.One of the more unique aspects of Rear Window is the perspective it gives us as the audience. We do just what Jefferies does, in a way, taking a look into the mysterious world of other people's private life. It's evident in the camerawork, the way that we see most characters in this film through Jefferies window only and how most of the film actually occurs inside of Jefferie's room. You could even argue that all of it happens there, in a way, which is something that I don't remember seeing done in any other film.I also like quite a bit the way that Hitchcocks diguises this film as a mystery film genre-wise, but it's actually more of a love story reflected through the mystery that surfaces here. It's cute, even.The score is great, too, in more than one way. I mean, it's both the background music - which is really good as it is, but it immerses us even further into the film by being diegetic - and the songs that appear on the film (specifically with Miss Lonelyhearts) which allude to some interesting details about her psyche.And, the thing that's evident in all of the film, is just how witty and fun the dialogue is. It has some genuinely funny puns, it flows well and I really like it overall.Though I don't think that there was anything specific that bothered me here, I do see it as a cute love-story film with creative motifs and a moral about the dangers of voyeurism and getting sucked into the lives of others, and nothing as grand or creative as Vertigo for instance. It's solid, accessible, well made. No complaints really, besides some minor pacing stuff here and there, but generally worth watching (though it doesn't live up to the hype in my eyes). I'd even say that it's more relevant today, with social media and all.So, Rear Window has something for almost everyone - romance, mystery, philosophy, well done cinematography. A bit of everything and a good amount of charm. Sure, I think it's somewhat overrated, but it's definitely worth your time if you ask me. I'm feeling a 7.8/10 on this one."
mahmudulhasan2,"Jun 20, 2022",10/10,"Tremendous thriller. Classic Hitchcock.In '54, I was seven years old and this is one of the first 'grown up' movies I remember seeing. I have seen it at least ten times since and realize seeing something different each time.James Stewart is a photographer in a wheelchair recovering from an accident. He passes the time by watching his neighbors out his apartment window. He thinks that he witnessed a murder and has trouble convincing his girlfriend, Grace Kelly, to help prove a crime was committed.Three scenes that always stuck with me:(1) Stewart fighting off his attacker with flashbulbs (2) the smoldering kiss (3) the glowing cigarette in the dark apartment.Every bit a classic. I think this is THE BEST Hitchcock movie. No offense intended toward PSYCHO, but this movie has the more human aspects of fear and terror. This super cast includes Raymond Burr, Thelma Ritter and Wendell Corey.Actually I wanted to everything where or she already told !"
paulineweinberger,"Jan 20, 2025",10/10,"While ""North by Northwest"" is my favorite Alfred Hitchcock film, his 1954 classic ""Rear Window"" is a very close second as it's a masterclass in audience manipulation. Based on a short story titled ""It Had to be Murder"" written by Cornell Woolrich aka William Irish, it tells the story of a news photographer named L. B. Jeffries who finds himself confined to his apartment for six weeks after an accident leaves him with a cast on his foot and in a wheelchair. With nothing else to do besides becoming voyeuristic towards his neighbors, he begins to watch the various people in his complex when a neighbor begins acting highly suspicious. This leads Jeffries to believe that the man has killed his wife, as her sudden disappearance and the man's odd behavior is caught through the binoculars and telephoto lens that our protagonist owns and this makes for a gripping mystery thriller and one of the best ever made.The genius of this film is how Hitchcock crafts the character of Jeffries, as the story is told from his point of view which turns us into voyeurs and has us believing what we see. However, a seed of doubt is created in our minds as Jeffries is presented as both a deeply concerned neighbor but also a nosy one whose boredom has led him to make crazy claims with no tangible proof. The camera work and editing here is spectacular, as we get various shots of people in their apartment living their lives and cut to James Stewart to get his reaction to it all and he tells us a lot just with facial expressions alone. We're never taken away from his perspective because it would otherwise take away from the magic of the film, as through his eyes we become just as curious as Jeffries while also believing that he's completely out of his jurisdiction.Stewart is great as our main character, as so much work is done for him before we get into the meat of the story that makes him a very compelling protagonist. He is a man who finds himself in a relationship with a woman named Lisa played by the extremely gorgeous Grace Kelly, but he looks to end it with her due to his own insecurities regarding their compatibility of lifestyles. Kelly is both stunning and classy as Lisa, someone who simply wants to love Jeffries for who he is but finds it difficult because of his stubborn nature and it makes for great comedic moments. Thelma Ritter as Stella is Jeffries's masseuse who talks sense into him regarding his current physical condition, as she feels he should relax and not get caught up in spying on his neighbors while Wendell Corey as Lt. Doyle acts as the one Jeffries consistently bothers about his neighbor's suspicious activity.The art direction from Hal Pereira and Joe McMillan Johnson is perfect for this story, with each apartment fusing within the same courtyard and each neighbor having their window open yet never paying attention to their surroundings. The cinematography from Robert Burks is beautiful, as the use of shadows creates a noir tone as this mystery develops throughout the film. What I truly love is how, similar to that of ""M,"" this film highlights the dangers of not knowing your neighbors and never taking interest in what's going on around you as a scene involving a dog really gets this message across clearly. We all fear not knowing if the person next door to us is hiding sinister secrets, yet we don't want to be bothered with it on our own until it's too late and this character is willing to put his own safety on the line to expose a murderer within the complex. This is one of Hitchcock's best films."

Raymond Burr wishes James looked at Miss Torso a little longer.Alfred Hitchcock's directorial prowess is on full display in ""Rear Window,"" a film that IMDb viewers have made the 14th best in movie history. Not to burst your bubble, but Hitch made better flicks than this, like ""Psycho,"" ""Vertigo,"" ""Strangers On A Train,"" ""The 39 Steps,"" and my all-time Hitchcock favorite, ""Shadow Of A Doubt."" But ""Rear Window"" is a hard film not to like, especially after you've seen it once or twice. The format is special, if not unique by Hitchcock standards, where we have a very controlled, limited setting, a man's Greenwich Village apartment that faces a courtyard and a number of apartment windows into various neighbors' lives. Think ""Lifeboat,"" ""Rope,"" or ""Dial M For Murder,"" only more varied. Instead of the people on the main set facing danger, they see apparent danger in a neighbor's dwelling, and sip adult beverages and chew fancy dinners while contemplating how to respond.Making it more special is the fact Stewart and Kelly do much of the thinking. Stewart's L.B. Jeffries is the main character, a bored photographer of some repute laid up by an injury he suffered while covering an auto race. Kelly as Lisa Carol Fremont is the high-profile, haute couture model used to wearing $1,100 gowns (in 1954!) and dining at Manhattan's 21 Club, but somehow willing to settle for Stewart amid all the Prince Rainier and Zoolander types she undoubtedly comes across.However absurd, the central relationship is cemented by an apparent murder Jeffries thinks he witnesses, and Fremont comes to believe he did, involving a neighbor and his nagging wife. It's a bit of an irony, and a pretty marvelous one, that has Hitchcock celebrate one impeding marriage by making them apparent vultures in the untimely demise of another. Such was Hitchcock.Great Greenwich Village ambiance, circa the early 1950s and ""My Sister Eileen/Wonderful Town"" rather than the drag queens and Stonewall riots of the near future. Boho artists co-exist with Miss Lonelyhearts-spinster types and costume jewelry salesmen that may be up to something more sinister, or not.I wasn't a fan of Grace Kelly until that shot of her in Thorwald's apartment looking out the window while holding the purse upside down. Now I think she's swell. Thelma Ritter seems to have dropped in from a Neil Simon comedy next door, but she totally rules the scenes she's in. The set design, and the peeks at the neighbors, is especially well-wrought. That scene when Stewart and Miss Lonelyhearts share a silent, sad toast across the courtyard is one of cinema's finest moments.While the mystery itself is kind of hokey and patly resolved, there's something special in the way it comes together on screen. It's one of Hitchcock's best meetings of comedy and suspense, and a great romance besides despite an early handicap (a beautiful, successful woman totally devoted to the leading man.) There's nothing to really dislike in this film, and while it's still not Hitch's best despite what all the IMDb voters say, it's a good-enough standard bearer for the best director cinema's ever known."
vad-2,"Jun 1, 1999",N/A,"For the third time in the last five years or more! I saw this film again on TV.  It was preceded by a film about Hitchock so this time I was looking for his identity as a Director more than the content of the film.I was disappointed with the story, the acting from two great actors, and the very limited set.  There was no suspense that normally could be expected from a Hitchcock film, even taking account that I had seen it before.The problem is that films date, we expect more now from writers, actors, producers and directors.  Everything moves on and up.  For example does anybody really enjoy silent movies anymore.  Would our children ever bother to see them?Although current technology in film making does not replace good acting and a good storyline, it does save a film which is deficient in these.  We used to accept almost anything put on the magic screen, because it was an experience.  Now we want more. I wonder if the producers of the new Star Wars epic have learnt the lesson - not rely on any one of the following three, all are important, storyline first,  acting and then the effects to stimulate the senses.  Although I have not seen the film yet, and I will when it comes to the UK,  I suspect by the many negative comments that there is too much reliance on technology and not enough on story and acting.  I hope  I'm  wrong . If not, an ideal chance to get it right would have been missed .  I will reserve judgement."
kuangzao,"Apr 21, 2020",7/10,"I won't be the first to say it: how do you shoot an entire film about looking out over your porch and not lose a minute's pace? You call yourself Alfred Hitchcock, since it seems only he can and only he has donee so. You have to google this one BUT SOMEONE HAS created a montage of the entire view from the Rear Window, to watch! It's a perfect delivery for such a closed situation."
coleboggan,"Feb 13, 2018",10/10,"I think that Alfred Hitchcock's rear window is a fantastic movie. I'd go as far as to say that it is one of the best thrillers I have ever seen. There are a few main aspects of the film that I would like to point out that sold me on this wonderful film: the framing and filming techniques, suspense building, and pacing of the film were all perfect, and made for an interesting, thrilling, and over-all exciting display of some of theater's finest filming techniques that will keep you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll.
 First, the framing of the film was excellent. Upon first hearing the premise, that the entire movie takes place from one man's room, you might be hesitant. Such a boring, consistent setting couldn't possibly make for an interesting film. But within the first few minutes of starting, you find very quickly that these first impressions were very wrong. The film manages to build a complex, active, and very real world using just the room of main character, photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, and the view from his window. By cutting from shots of his apartment to the surrounding complex outside, the movie manages to make you think there's more to this film than just Jeff's living room. On top of this, the framing techniques used keep the film exciting. To start, you never see more than Jeff can through his window; this allows you to really connect with the characters, and theorize about the events going on at the same time as they do. We'll talk more about this under pacing, but the film always gives you just enough information to make you wonder what's really going on. Using what's not shown in frame as much as what is, Hitchcock manages to keep you glued to the screen throughout the movie.
 This lasting interest is brought about just as much through the pacing and suspense of the film. While Jeff is looking out his window one day, he notices some suspicious behavior from one of his neighbors, and begins to think he has witnessed a murder. As the film continues, the evidence of this is given to you in bits and pieces. You only see half the story, and half to piece the puzzle together yourself, along with the main characters, who slowly start to believe Jeff's theories about his neighbor's actions. However, with every bit of evidence towards the crime, Jeff's detective friend strikes it down with a completely logical explanation, leading Jeff, and the audience along with him, to believe that he might be delusional. Every plot point in the film is spaced beautifully, so that every time you think you've figured it out, some new idea or suspicious act comes up and throws you completely off. As Jeff slowly convinces more people that he's witnessed a murder, there are always others who outright deny his ideas.
 Another point related to pacing is the building of suspense. The movie manages to subtly build suspense as the movie progresses, resulting in a thrilling conclusion. One method it uses to do this is by confining our hero. Due to an accident at a race track, Jeff is confined to the wheelchair in his room with a broken leg. He is unable to leave his room, which is what results in him watching his neighbors through his rear window. The suspense continues to build as he watches helplessly as the events before him unfold. There's nothing he can do but watch it happen and try to make a convincing argument. 
 With all of these filming concepts combined, Alfred Hitchcock was able to produce one of the best thrillers of all time, certainly the best I've ever seen. It was intense, interesting, and kept me theorizing until the last second. With a great cast and exceptional production value, I would easily recommend this film to anyone looking for a classic with an exciting plot and interesting premise that will keep you engaged and entertained."
margaret_thanos,"Aug 6, 2021",7/10,"This film is famous for its use of the camera, and for exploring the idea of voyeurism - something very much frowned up at the time. However, in the modern age I do feel that it was incredibly slow paced and sometimes difficult to continue paying attention to. The camera is fantastically used in this film, and Grace Kelly is divine. However, James Stewart leaves something to be desired."
Red-Barracuda,"Jul 29, 2011",9/10,"Rear Window is about an immobilised man Jeff who is restricted to his apartment and spies on his neighbours through boredom. He is sure he witnesses a neighbour called Thorwald murder his wife across the courtyard and is thereafter determined to prove he is right. He enrols the help of his girlfriend Lisa to help him solve the puzzle.Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's biggest critical and commercial successes of the 50's. Starring James Stewart and Grace Kelly (introduced with a glorious dream-like slow-motion kiss), it followed the template of his earlier films such as The 39 Steps where it combined suspense, comedy and romance. It is also one of his most purely cinematic movies. The story is told by imagery whenever possible such as the opening pan where we see all the neighbours, then the bandaged Jeff and the contents of his apartment – in this brief bit of camera work we learn much about Jeff's situation without a word being spoken. The camera POV almost never leave's Jeff's apartment. We observe the people across the courtyard but we only faintly hear them at best. The film relies on an optically subjective narrative, where we see what Jeff sees, and we see how he reacts. The issue of voyeurism presents the film's moral dilemma. Is it right to spy on your neighbours? Obviously Jeff uncovers a murder so his actions seem ultimately justified but there is an underlying darkness to his motives. It could be reasonably argued that Jeff subconsciously wants Thorwald to have murdered his wife so that he has an exciting murder-mystery to solve that will alleviate the daily boredom of recovering from his broken leg.Rear Window is a film about looking. It reflects the cinematic experience itself. Jeff passively watches other lives unfold from a fixed position in a similar way to how we the audience watch movies. The neighbours could almost be said to represent different genres of film – the musician (the musical), Miss Lonelyhearts (the melodrama), the elderly couple with the dog (domestic comedy), Miss Torso (soft-core erotica), the newlyweds (social realism), the Thorwalds (murder-mystery). At the very least, his neighbours over the courtyard represent a microcosm of the society of a big city. Moreover, the scenes from the other apartments offer alternative possibilities to Jeff's own bachelor life – loneliness (Miss Lonelyhearts), the restrictions of marriage (the newlyweds) and, at a horrific extreme, domestic homicide (the Thorwalds). The roles that the immobile Jeff and the active Lisa are reversed over the court with Thorwald and his bed-ridden wife. Much of the romantic thread of the film concerns Jeff's reluctance to commit to Lisa, and unmistakable parallels can be drawn between them and the Thorwalds.Rear Window in other words is a multi-layered masterpiece. An experimental visual exercise, a romantic drama, an examination of the cinema watching experience; and of course a witty, supremely acted and immaculately directed thriller. Much more than meets the eye!"
classicalsteve,"Jan 11, 2007",10/10,"The night is dark, quiet. But at peace? No. Jimmy Stewart, playing a gritty photographer, sleeps in his wheel-chair, the victim of some car racing accident, the result of his attempting to obtain an extraordinary picture. Now he's fettered by a cast as the result of this daring attempt. A shadow moves over his sleeping body. Is it malevolent? A rival come to enact revenge? Or the grim reaper come to take Stewart's soul? NO! It is none other than the 1950's goddess of cinema, Grace Kelly replete with white gown, scarf and gloves. She moves over the drowsy photographer and plants a kiss on his lips. The shadow is not a monster at all but an angel from Hollywood Heaven. Stewart has died and gone to eternal Paradise where he will love and worship Princess Grace for eternity! But for most of the movie he doesn't quite realize that Kelly is a beautiful gift, even beautifully wrapped!There are films, both old and new, which boast a ""cast of thousands"" and shot in 5 different continents. Well, there are few feature-length films that were shot only on one sound state. And maybe none that I know of whose primary shots are essentially a handful of camera angles from a single vantage point on that one sound stage. Yet this is what Hitchcock does to tell a very compelling story. And the viewpoint is a laid-up photographer played brilliantly by Jimmy Stewart who has nothing better to do than watch people through his rear window.The focus is Stewart's suspicion of criminal acts by one of his neighbors who he can see across the way with either his binoculars or his camera with zoom lens. His suspicion is aroused through his habit of innocently spying on the the inhabitants of the buildings on his block. What's interesting is the amount of mileage Hitchcock attains from telling a story from this peculiar vantage point in the form of other sub-stories. There is the woman on the bottom-floor of the apartment across the way who can't seem to find the right man, dubbed ""Miss Lonely Heart"". There is another younger woman, a dancer, who can't seem to keep men away from her. She is named ""Miss Torso."" A songwriter and/or composer lives in another apartment. A newlywed couple move in to another apartment. As the story unfolds, the other stories unfold as well in different ways. And in addition to the main story, most of the other stories have some sort of resolution by the end of the film.This cinematic concept is one of the most innovative techniques ever backed by a major film studio. Stewart is perfectly cast as the husky photographer turned amateur sleuth. Grace Kelly who only seems to get better with each viewing, plays Stewart's desperate girlfriend who is involved in the fashion industry on Madison Avenue. The characters seem made for each other like Dracula and sunlight. She loves the glitz and glamorous life of the sophisticated fashion crowd on Madison Avenue while he seems more at home crawling in the mud of another country to get the photograph of a lifetime. Thelma Ritter keeps Stewart in check as the reluctant nurse who tries to get him to take the plunge with Kelly and also gets caught up in the mystery. And Raymond Burr plays the man across the way to whom Stewart focuses his attention. His unsmiling haunting expressions are enough to portray his secretive character.This is an absolute masterpiece of film-making. The dialog is fun, witty, sarcastic, with constant innuendos about love and marriage. Kelly plays the ""straight-man"" while Stewart get's away with lines that he'd be lynched for today by women's groups. The only thing that doesn't make sense: why is Stewart so reluctant to tie the knot with Kelly? Grace Kelly was probably the Cary Grant of actresses in the 1950's with millions of males looking on with absolute jealousy of her leading men. (I'm sure many men's heart went bust when she became Princess Grace) Of course, Stewart sees her as ""too perfect"", ""too beautiful"", and ""too smart"" for him. Ironically, the more he pushes her away the more she wants to come back to him. Which does point to one of the strangest foibles of the human psyche: when someone can't quite have something that he or she wants, the more he or she wants it!"
Rebochan,"Jul 21, 2001",10/10,"They don't make movies this way anymore.  Consider how deceptively simple the plot is-A photographer, confined to a wheelchair until his broken leg heals, is spying on his neighbors in an apartment complex and thinks that he is the only witness to a murder.  The movie often seems simple, too-The camera shots are pretty much only what the lead character can see, meaning that you see everyone in the complex from outside their windows.  Yet this movie never needs the heart-pounding airplane chase of North by Northwest to build a powerful momentum that hooks you in and never lets you go.I must be fortunate-I saw this when it was re-released into theaters recently.  Twice.  I loved it so much the first time that I had to see it again.  I've seen the last hour on TV twice since.  Even when presented with only that last hour, I still couldn't stop watching until the ending credits rolled.  Yes, they don't make movies like this anymore.The leading players are well-chosen.  You've got James Stewart as the wheelchair-bound photographer and Grace Kelly as his rich, fashionable girlfriend who is head-over-heels for him.  Theirs is not the only love story-several people in the complex have their own romances to deal with, in particular, the tragic Miss Lonelyheart, who sets dinner for two every night, even though she never has company.  The characters we see from a distance are surprisingly well-developed, and live such natural lives, such as a woman who lives on the top floor of the building across from the photographer.  She puts her dog in a basket everyday and lowers him down to the ground so that he can play.  Such simple traits are also very human.Then there is the gripping story.  You're never given any more information than our protagonist has.  Stewart is forced to prove that Mrs. Anna Thorwald was murdered by her husband, Lars, and keeps trying to convince his detective friend (played by Wendall Corey) of her murder.  In the meantime, he's also trying to work out his own lovelife, and often what he sees in the windows reflect his mood, particularly a speech delivered by the woman with the dog about how neighbors should treat each other(another example of Hitchcock's masterful use of subtlety).It's these subtle details and deceptive simplicity that make this movie so fantastic.  You just don't see movies like this now-everything must now be explicitly stated to the audience.  Hitchcock does not play that game-he expects his audience to be intelligent enough to understand the meaning of every scene and to know what is going on without the characters explaining even the most minute details.  This movie should be required viewing for everyone that loves movies."
claudio_carvalho,"Dec 8, 2009",9/10,"In New York, the daring photographer L. B. Jefferies (James Stewart) has been confined to his small apartment for five weeks in a wheelchair with one broken leg.

However, Lisa decides to go further in her investigation, getting closer to the suspect.""Rear Window"" is one of my favorite classics ever and I do not know precisely how many times I have watched this film. There are many rip-offs of this simple story but none of them gets closer to this wonderful film. The first difference is in the direction of Alfred Hitchcock, a refined director with the subtle and witty British humor, capable to give meaning to a scene with one word or expression of his characters. The awesome James Stewart and the gorgeous and classy Grace Kelly show a perfect chemistry and it is impressive the beauty and elegance of the future princess of Monaco. Thelma Ritter is excellent in the role of the caustic nurse Stella. This time, the cameo of Alfred Hitchcock is in the apartment of the composer twiddling his clock. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Janela Indiscreta"" (""Indiscreet Window"")Note: On 07 November 2024, I saw this film again."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 10, 2013",10/10,"IMHO this is the best Alfred Hitchcock movie ever made. It is even better than Psycho which I consider one of the greatest movie of all times. It is often imitated but never duplicated. And every time it's referenced, there is no doubt that it's this movie that is the originator.Photographer L.B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is stuck at home in his New York apartment after breaking his leg while getting a shot. He does nothing but look out his rear window. He suspects his neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) of murder and enlists the help of his gorgeous girlfriend Lisa Freemont (Grace Kelly) and nurse Stella (Thelma Ritter).This takes place all in the same place inside his apartment. First it allows for the voyeuristic tendency in everyone. It is something hidden that Hitchcock has dug up and presented wrap in a pretty bow. Second he has the perfect everyman in Jimmy Stewart. Third Hitchcock has dug his little hands into our brains. He knows that we all make up little stories for all those we spy on. I love that even the voices from the neighbors are muffled as we strain to hear them.It is the perfect film because none of it is wasted. Every frame of film is consumed as we try to decipher clues from them. Grace Kelly is impossibly gorgeous which makes it even easier on the eyes. For all the different neighbors, it is like many movies in a movie."
zennelsfrida,"Sep 22, 2024",N/A,"Rear Window is a classic that still holds up today.While some may find the pacing slow by modern standards, it's the tension and suspense that make this film timeless.James Stewart delivers a great performance as the confined photographer, and Grace Kelly shines with her elegance and charm.The way Hitchcock builds the story, using only what's visible from the apartment window, is genius. The suspense builds slowly but steadily, keeping you hooked!I am a huge fan of this director, but this film, OMG this film never feels old or outdated. It's a must-watch for anyone who enjoys a well-crafted, timeless thriller."
EdwardtheBlackPrince,"Jun 28, 2023",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window follows Jimmy Stewart as a Photographer. Who after an accident confined him to his Apartment. When he's not being wed by his Nurse and visited by his Girlfriend Lisa (Grace Kelly). He spends his time spying on his neighbors to pass the time. He soon suspects one of his neighbors (Raymond Burr) just might have killed his wife and tries to prove it. Rear Window is an interesting film especially for its time a very self-contained movie it does a great job of adding suspense and mystery while also adding a dark sense of charm and humor. As well as a sense of self-doubt. Giving this is a setting that's very limiting pretty much puts us in the perspective of Jimmy how do you make this rear window received work for a whole movie? It does that by making a colorful cast of its leads and the side characters. You spend a good chunk of the film getting to know these characters the relationship between Lisa and Jeff a cynical relationship at first, to say the least Jeff is kind of a jerk but doesn't feel like he deserves or warrants a girl like Lisa who is very charming and life to her. Feels there's this disconnect between marriage and a fling. And kind of starts to reflect on himself as he watches his neighbors who themselves are almost in their sort of prison. You see this similarity between the songwriter trying to complete his song or Ms. Lonesome who a very sad and the newlyweds. Even though none of these characters interact with each other or the leads you get enough of what their about. And of course, having Raymond Burr Perry Mason himself was nothing short of genius to add to this mystery and charm when cutting between the killer and the neighbors."
drebin73,"Feb 22, 2006",10/10,"This is the greatest movie of all time. I believe that Jimmy Stewart is one of the greatest actors ever and that Grace Kelly is one of the best actresses of the era. Rear Window takes place in a small apartment complex in the village. Jimmy Stewart plays famous photographer L. B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies who after an accident is confined to a wheelchair with a broken leg. He has nothing to do but stare out of the window and look at the neighbors. He plays this role very well. When Jeff thinks he has witnessed a murder from the apartment across the way he gets help from his high society girl friend Lisa played by Grace Kelly and his comical nurse Stella played by Thelma Ritter and his detective friend Lt. Doyle played by Wendell Corey. When you carefully watch the movie you can see that there is a great amount of humor throughout the whole film as well as a whole crap-load of suspense. Thelma Ritter is the more obvious comic relief of the film with funny one liners: "" When two people love each other, they come together - WHAM - like two taxis on Broadway. "" One thing that this movie tackles is the subject of voyeurism the act of watching someone without there knowledge and not for sexual gratification. This is what most movies are anyway, we are in a way spying on the people in the movie and become interested in their lives.This movie just focuses on it specifically. One thing that it is interesting is how the camera never leaves Jeff's apartment. We can see conversations between the neighbors but we can not hear what they are saying so we have to figure out what is going on by their body language. The whole movie is a bunch of reaction shots from Stewart. Jeff sees something, then we see him react to it. Another thing in this movie is the relation ship between Jeff and Lisa ""Jeff: She wants me to marry her. Stella: That's normal. Jeff: I don't want to. Stella: That's abnormal."" Jeff feels that her lifestyle would not be the kind that she would want to be apart of seeing that he travels all over the world to photograph things like war and other things of that nature"" Raymond Burr stars as the suspected murderer Lars Thorwald. This movie is the greatest movie and I can't do it justice by telling you about it like this. This one just needs to be seen by everybody. 11 out of 10"

robert-temple-1,"May 10, 2017",4/10,"When this film was released, it was a big hit, but much of the reason for that was that Grace Kelly was in it, and she was the darling then. Also, people had not yet grown tired of James Stewart. But the film itself is contrived, artificial, tedious, unconvincing, and silly. Looking back now at the ethereal beauty of Grace Kelly, her perfect face, her perfect dainty profile, her perfect lips as she kisses, and her highly cultivated dreamy look which is meant to convince us that she is in love, it is a bit like remembering that one tried to eat the lace-like sugar ornament on the first wedding cake one encountered as a child: far too sweet, indeed sickly. The outrageous designer dresses and suits worn by Kelly in this film, including a ludicrously flouncy skirt, can perhaps be excused by the period, combined with a director indulging his well-known fantasies. But let's consider the film itself and what is wrong with it. For one thing, it is one of those films set in a single room which directors vainly imagine they can make compelling for the entire length of a film, but so rarely do. Alfred Hitchcock was notorious for preferring always to shoot in controlled studio conditions whenever he could, and would build whole exteriors inside a studio rather than step outside to the real thing where – what was it? – he was afraid of catching cold? No, it was insecurity and the need for control, especially control over those beautiful blonde victim actresses whom he wished to dominate either directly or through story lines. He could not kiss them himself, but he could have other people kiss them and film it. He could also punish them, or even murder them on screen. In this film, Grace Kelly is not killed, though she does have a serious scare. The story is about a press photographer who has broken his leg and is stranded in his small Manhattan apartment with his entire leg in plaster, sitting in a wheelchair by his large rear window. From there, he can spy on his neighbours, at first through binoculars, but later through a telephoto lens attached to his camera. It is summer in Manhattan, apparently August, when everyone in the 1950s was sweating and suffering from the heat, and air conditioners were not yet widespread. All the windows are open, one couple are sleeping at night on a mattress on an outside balcony, and everyone is on view, and one can hear everything and see everything. The photographer is played by James Stewart. He turns into a compulsive Peeping Tom because he is bored and, after all, he is a photographer who is always looking for things anyway. Stewart plays the role in his usual default manner, that of the droll and drawling good fellow. (His acting range was never broadband. He could always be counted on to be the same.) Grace Kelly flies in every evening in some fantasy gown or other to look after him. She professes that she adores him, loves him overwhelmingly, and why cannot they marry. He grumbles and complains both to her and his masseuse Thelma Ritter that Kelly isn't really what he is looking for. Pull the other unbroken leg! Grace Kelly not good enough for him? Try telling that to the public. The whole world was lusting after Grace Kelly at that moment, and tedious, drawling James Stewart wants to find someone better? How can she put up with him is the better question. And yet, this is what Hitchcock would have us believe. But she is having none of it, and will not be disposed of by her boring choice of husband-to-be. Being as well endowed with money as she is with good looks, she goes off to The 21 Club and orders a takeaway dinner for two. It arrives, carried by a man in a red bellhop uniform, and consists of a bottle of chilled Puligny Montrachet (of unimaginable expense in America then, and indeed now) and lobster thermidor. And thus her courtship of her reluctant photographer is carried out. She brings a small overnight bag because she is going to stay with him one night, and from it she pulls something long and silky. Shortly afterwards she emerges from the bedroom dressed in the most outrageous Hollywood floating negligee and strikes a pose in front of Stewart, asking him how he likes it (i.e., how he likes her). He remains indifferent. Surely erotic fantasy is here butting its head against a brick wall. Stewart remains more interested in spying on the neighbours. (Is he gay? What is his problem?) He rolls his jaw around and does a bit of drawling with it from time to time. Are there really no other takers on Kelly's Park Avenue? Must she really keep coming slumming in Lower Manhattan where her adored James Stewart overlooks a motley back yard with different small apartments inhabited by oddballs? (There is the usual irritating bad soprano practising her scales, an all too realistic touch, though we never see her.) Several of the oddballs are overdone, to say the least. The dancing girl in shorts is perhaps the most ridiculous. The story concerns Stewart believing that he may have witnessed the aftermath of a man murdering his invalid wife, cutting her body up and taking it away in stages in a metal suitcase. Everyone ridicules him for imagining this, but Grace Kelly and Thelma Ritter end up believing him and try to collect additional evidence. This lengthy and languid attempt to keep us watching this dreary story is a complete waste of time."
evanston_dad,"Jul 19, 2006",10/10,"""Rear Window"" represents Alfred Hitchcock at his most playful.This is Hitchcock's most fully realized comment about the obsession with voyeurism that reared its head repeatedly throughout his ouvre, an obsession not only of his, but one shared by the characters in his films and the audience watching them -- for without the delight that comes in watching other people, who would filmmakers be making films for?""Rear Window"" is a nearly perfect movie: perfectly plotted, perfectly directed, perfectly acted. James Stewart could play characters like this in his sleep, but that fact does not make his performance any less entertaining. Some of the ice melts off of Grace Kelly's facade, and she gives the wittiest and sexiest performance of her career. And who can say enough about Thelma Ritter? A truly unique character actor in the history of cinema, Ritter always played the audience's id, thinking and saying all of the things all of the other characters in the film were too polite or nervous to think and say themselves. She could recite a weather forecast in that sardonic, world-weary monotone of hers, and it would still be funny.Hitchcock was always able to blend suspense, romance and social commentary to varying degrees of success, but almost always better than most other directors could manage. ""Rear Window"" stands as an example of what happened when he struck a perfect balance between all three.Grade: A+"
Anonymous_Maxine,"Apr 2, 2001",10/10,"Rear Window is Alfred Hitchcock's comment on the voyeuristic quality of society (`We've become a race of peeping toms'). It is the story of a man bound to a wheelchair by a broken leg who sees what he believes to be a murder being covered up in an apartment across the courtyard from him.James Stewart delivers an excellent performance as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, the magazine photographer who is bound to a wheelchair and who finds himself spying on his neighbors, at first out of boredom but very soon out of strong suspicion. This is a very talky thriller and is limited entirely to what is seen from Jeff's large apartment window. The fact that the entire two-hour film takes place in such a small setting is a strong statement about Hitchcock's tremendous skills as a director. He makes the film interesting in countless ways, such as his excellent, meaningful use of shadows, the very thorough character development, his interesting use of symbolism (such as Jeff's difficulty in reaching itches underneath his cast), not to mention the amazingly effective suspense, a Hitchcock trademark.Just before Jeff notices some suspicious events occurring across the courtyard, he is constantly complaining about not being able to find any interesting work as a photographer, and it is ironic that he soon finds something interesting right outside his own window, and while he is confined to a wheelchair, no less. The fascinating crime story of the man across the courtyard having murdered his wife is made even creepier by the fact that it is all deducted from behavior that Jeff sees out his window, and we don't even find out for sure if he is right or not until the film's exciting climax. Hitchcock fans are also likely to notice a line of dialogue that may have foreshadowed some of the events that were to later take place in Psycho, such as the insurance company nurse's speculation that the killer must have cut up his wife's body in the bathtub (`That's the only place he could have washed away the blood').Another thing that sets Rear Window aside from other thrillers (including its own 1998 re-make which, incidentally, was far superior to the 1998 re-make of Psycho), was the way that it had several stories going on at the same time, which is one of the ways that it was able to remain so interesting. Jeff is an injured photographer, he is unsatisfied with his work, he is having a dilemma about marrying his sweetheart because he feels she is too perfect for him (the flimsiest excuse on the planet, of course, but he actually makes it make a little bit of sense), and then he comes across these events across the courtyard from his apartment that make him think that there has been a murder over there, and the murderer (Raymond Burr) is trying to cover it up.Some of the things that happen in this film are not perfect, or seem uncharacteristic of Hitchcock, but the film as a whole is still spectacularly effective. For example, as a Hitchcock scholar, I found it strange that the killer strangled the dog and left it in the middle of the courtyard for all to see (and for Jeff to make revealing conclusions about). Think about how much more effective this would have been if the woman who owned the dog had just stood out on her porch calling for him, and he never came. This way, the realization that the man had killed the dog would have been much more gradually realized, and may have made the suspense created by it that much more impressive. At any rate, this is an outstanding film, and Hitchcock definitely created an amazing amount of suspense with such limited means, leading up to a tremendous climax that provided a quick but satisfying ending to this classic film."

rollernerd,"Apr 17, 2021",7/10,"Welcome back to another edition of Adam's Reviews!! **queue in intro music**Tonight's FINAL Hitchcock movie review is Rear Window (1954), starring Hitch's frequent collaborator, the legend James Stewart who plays Jeffries, a photographer who is currently bound to a wheelchair due to breaking his leg and is slowly recuperating. Jeffries passes his time spying on his neighbours from his apartment window during his recovery and soon becomes convinced one of them has committed murder. So, what does good old Jefferies do? He sees what he believes to be a murder and decides to solve the crime himself with the help of his nurse and love interest played by Grace Kelly. This is a beautifully constructed as a story with a few laughs throughout the flick and the master gives makes you second guess on who is in the wrong here? The flick swims through the themes of voyeurism and projecting your own narrative onto things. It would have been interesting had Stewart's character been darker such as actually taking pictures of his neighbours, which would enhance his obsession on what is happening outside his apartment window. The ending to me doesn't execute the building tension throughout the flick nor does it question on whether it is ethical and moral to meddle in others' affairs. The apartment neighbours play interesting minor characters in the film which provide interesting subplots and would have been great if the master diverged from a simple generic ending to a darker toned ending which would of emphasized how paranoia can inflict damage both internally and to others. Another great element is how Hitch effectively uses the ""three-part POV"" by using intense zoom-ins which provides the movie goer the central character POV. Overall a fun inventive flick 7/10. And that is a wrap with Hitchcock movies!!"
JaneBingley,"Aug 7, 2024",7/10,"""Rear Window"" is a masterclass in suspense, offering a captivating and voyeuristic exploration of human curiosity and paranoia. Set almost entirely within the confines of a Greenwich Village apartment, Hitchcock's direction turns the protagonist's limited perspective into an immersive experience for the audience.James Stewart delivers a stellar performance as L. B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries, a wheelchair-bound photographer who becomes obsessed with watching his neighbors, suspecting one of murder. Grace Kelly's portrayal of Lisa Fremont is both elegant and spirited, albeit a bit flat. But she is providing a perfect counterbalance to Stewart's intense curiosity.The film's innovative use of space and sound, coupled with a meticulously crafted narrative, keeps viewers on the edge of their seats. ""Rear Window"" is a timeless piece that showcases Hitchcock's unparalleled ability to transform the ordinary into the extraordinary, making it a must-watch for any cinema enthusiast."
prash_142,"Mar 3, 2007",1/10,"I don't know what the people find so interesting about the movie.. First of all, everybody's lives are taking place with 'open windows'.. This is very unlikely in a neighborhood. Assuming this is the plot of the movie and watching it, you will not be surprised if you fall asleep. The movie progresses very slowly and I almost slept away once. Had to play the movie again and force myself to watch it during day time.There is no twist in the movie. No turns, no thrill or no suspense.. Everything moves as expected and the climax is also bad. Better not watch it and waste your time.. Go for Vertigo or Rebecca. They are better.."
secondtake,"Mar 30, 2010",10/10,"Rear Window (1954)Director Alfred Hitchcock's movies have almost always cut against one of the strongest currents in American Cinema: complete verisimilitude. Even some of his masterpieces, like North by Northwest, Vertigo, or Psycho use montage, special lighting effects, and backprojection to break out of pure believable film-making. But it's intentional. It's part of the experience of watching a movie, like watching a play, that reminds you that you are a viewer, and the movie is a separate thing, a work of art, or stretch of celluloid in a can.He even presses this point in every film by inserting himself in the movie. How can you not notice the director winking, as if to say, don't forget, this is all a big game.Rear Window makes intentional artifice the defining aesthetic of the entire shoot. And now wonderful it all works. Yes, we can totally accept it all, somehow. The events are unusual, but not unbelievable, and the acting is candid and remarkably nuanced with everyday expressions. Jimmy Stewart in particular is amazing as the wheelchair bound photographer with nothing to do but look at the neighbors in around the courtyard, but Thelma Ritter is also in top form, quirky but in a lovable, not distracting, way.The rest, outside, is all theater. We see with uncanny perfection what is happening through all these apartment windows, and so there is a dancer and a pianist and a newlywed couple and a lonely middle aged woman and a bickering couple and another couple who sleeps on the fire escape. It's exaggerated just so, partly comic, partly trenchant (who can not love the groom carrying the bride over the threshold?), and we see it more or less through Stewart's eyes, and appreciate his reactions up close. What a great set up for a movie, and for storytelling in general.And so, night and day and beautiful twilight, we learn about the neighbors and events begin to sort out and suspicions about one neighbor's activities rise. And rise higher, causing disruption among those in Stewart's apartment (including his girlfriend, played by Grace Kelly). It goes from there, always a little lighthearted, but with such visual, quiet, deft handling you just sweep along happily, sometimes joyously. The echoes of camera angles, the moving in and out in space, the layering of close views and far as he looks through his camera's telephoto on and off, all make for a steady visual pace that gives a sense of control and confidence. We know we are in a deliberate movie, and that the artifice will surprise us and delight us both. And that we will come away unscathed, but enchanted.There might be better made films, or more ingenious films, or movies that have deeper messages and funnier lines, or ones that move you one way or another, but there are few films this carefully flawless. You might say that about any number of Hitchcock films, but in fact those brief moments of montage or backprojection in those films are distracting to us now, coming in a movie of greater verisimilitude. In Rear Window, as in Charles Laughton's The Night of the Hunter the next year, the artificial style and structure is part of the movie, and we accept it and require it to remain so."
uzakbirgolge,"Jan 15, 2022",10/10,"Could a cult director as David Fincher etc, remake this awesome movie with Ryan Gosling and Margot Robbie as main characters? Especially Ryan Gosling is dramatically look alike to James Stewart. And gorgeus beauty Margot Robbie with her waggish style can alter greatest beauty Grace Kelly ."
Irene212,"Aug 9, 2009",10/10,"With over 400 glowing reviews already posted, the only thing that needs to be added is that, if ever a movie proved that ""spoilers"" can't spoil a superb film, it's ""Rear Window.""The movie is smashing great fun even if you know the ending, because what matters is not ""The End"" but how we got there. I've seen ""Rear Window"" at least a dozen times, and it seduces me every time with the smart dialog, the performances (go, Thelma!), and especially with the way Hitchcock builds suspense in what is essentially a comic film. He is the master.Consider just one scene: Grace Kelly climbing the fire escape stairs to Thorwald's apartment. Every time I watch it, my heart starts racing. Not as much as the first time, I'll allow, but every time.Far from spoiling a good film, knowing the ending actually allows you to better appreciate the structure and skill that went into it. After all, who doesn't know how Romeo and Juliet ends? Or Amadeus? Or The Gospel According to St. Matthew? Does that mean they're ""spoiled""? And it isn't just true of adaptations, biographies, and the Bible. Even original stories that seem to depend on surprise-- thrillers like ""The Sixth Sense,"" mysteries like ""Chinatown,"" comedies like ""The Sting""- - are just as good the second time if they're well-made in the first place."
schappe1,"Sep 7, 2003",10/10,"It was Fred Astaire who discovered that you have to photograph dancers with a static camera because dancers move and a moving camera reduces movement. Most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, (although not all: see ROPE) are like a game of billiards. The characters are like billiard balls moving all over the table and colliding with each other until they all meet at the finale. But here the camera is static and it is the world that moves. What comes out is not simply the story, but all the details- all the stories. The result is a moment in time- a few days in the courtyard of a New York City apartment building in the sweaty summer of 1954- captured forever and most vividly. How many details and how many human stories do you see in FOREIGN CORRESPONDENT, SABOTEUR, THE MAN WHO KNEW TOO MUCH or NORTH BY NORTHWEST? Just the one. When you watch those films you are in an audience in a theater, watching a story played out on the screen. Here you see it all. You are in the movie. Remembering REAR WINDOW is like remembering something that you witnessed yourself- something that actually happened to you, not just a movie you watched. The result is not just Hitchcock's greatest film but one of the greatest films ever made.The marvelous detail of this film is just amazing. Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly are legends of the cinema and Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey and Raymond Burr are actor's actors. But the real star is the set, a world unto itself. And the photography of that set, all that was needed to allow us to see into the rooms clearly- it's amazing stuff, (the lighting needed was so hot it set off the sprinkler system). But even better than that is the sound. It's not all just flat on the soundtrack, like actors in a dubbing session. Like good radio drama, it recognizes that people who are some distance away sound different. The voices coming from across the courtyard are just perfectly done and do more than even the camera work to `put you there'.The musical score for this film is not a film score at all- it's the music of these people, also heard across the courtyard. We hear the composer composing his song. We don't hear him doing it in five minutes, as we have heard in all the musicals. Instead it evolves over time. The dramatic piano cords he plays underscore the drama to come. We also hear some opera music that does the same. Everyone seems to have their own music-everyone except Thorwald, the murderer. And what a brilliant touch it is to make the murder a pathetic man, instead of some brilliant mastermind. In the end, he is one of us, as well, in a twisted way.I can't think of another movie that creates a world so vivid for the audience to live in. ROPE was strictly about the action in the apartment. The view out the window is just a painted backdrop. Maybe a better comparison could me made to DEAD END, but as good as that film it's not really the same. Our perspective changes too much. Perhaps my favorite scene in REAR WINDOW is the one moment, (seconds, really), the perspective does change. It's when Jefferies is struggling with Thorwald and everyone in the apartment house looks in the direction of his apartment for a change. Now there's a twist!"
eagandersongil,"Aug 14, 2016",10/10,"""Rear Window"" might is not the best film of Alfred Hitchcock, but it's my favorite and I think impeccable, starting with the script that develops several different characters just showing a few minutes via a window, and the script shows the daydreams LB Jeffries, who is with a broken leg and kill the boredom observes its neighbors to notice a strange behavior ... no need to even say that the suspense in the film is even more amazing in the final 30 minutes, you can not even blink, and the best is that Alfred still put shades of humor in the film that fall very well. The picture is beautiful, without words, that vision for the buildings and their indiscreet windows has its own life, or look like a movie, it seems that Alfred Hitchcock filmed a building any in an American suburb, the soundtrack although not very participant in the film, she is accurate, the main plot the film will count through small steps the stories of several families, all very fast and complete, you feel the LB Jeffries himself, the performances are very good, although redundancy praise actors like James Stewart and Grace Kelly, the movie is great, mixing humor, romance, drama and suspense in a very effective way, I recommend any movie Alfred Hitchcock, but this, I place a starlet.Sorry my English translator google."
sme_no_densetsu,"Aug 14, 2011",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's ""Rear Window"" is one of his best known films, along with the likes of ""Psycho"", ""Vertigo"" & ""North by Northwest"". It is perhaps his most purely cinematic film while also showcasing his mastery of the art of suspense.The story concerns a photographer (James Stewart) who is stuck in his apartment nursing a broken leg. He occupies his time by watching the actions of his neighbours. When he begins to suspect one of them of murder he enlists the aid of his socialite girlfriend (Grace Kelly) and his nurse (Thelma Ritter).While the film's cast members didn't land any Oscar nominations there were nevertheless several fine performances. You could say that James Stewart's performance almost single-handedly carried the picture but that would seem dismissive of the quality support given by Thelma Ritter, Wendell Corey & Raymond Burr. Meanwhile, Grace Kelly looks exquisite in the female lead and she gives an excellent performance to boot.The direction of Alfred Hitchcock and the screenplay of John Michael Hayes (both Oscar-nominated) are best considered in tandem. The separate threads of the intricate storyline are masterfully manipulated by Hitchcock with a visual approach that puts us squarely in Stewart's position. Also, I'm not usually one who notices sound design in films but the sound in this film is superb. Little wonder that it was nominated for an Oscar, as was the attractive cinematography. The Edith Head costumes also deserve special mention.Ultimately, ""Rear Window"" is practically flawless. It's highly satisfying both as a piece of entertainment and as a piece of cinematic art. Anyone looking to experience Hitchcock at his best would be well advised to start here."
zozulyamak,"Jan 16, 2022",N/A,"A nice example of an old classic. Movie, made in 1954, compels with likeable and truthful characters of that time. Story takes place only in one city backyard. Despite it, Alfred Hitchcock manages to tell us stories of many people populating the house alongside with the main one. Eventually, main characters who observe others get to dwell deep into something they find suspiciously shady."
jameslinton-75252,"Apr 19, 2016",6/10,"Honestly, I think this film is overrated. I felt that a lot of the film was just tension-building to a climax that never really arrived. The tension-building itself was very effective, but I was disappointed that it never amounted to anything. In fact I did get a little bored at times.Don't get me wrong, I don't think Rear Window was terrible, just overrated. I liked the small cast and small set, which I found really helped to convey the claustrophobia that Jeffries is feeling. It also did well in building the tension.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/6xbZO7"
NikkoFranco,"May 27, 2018",10/10,"As a Hitchcock fan, I am guilty of serial-watching his oeuvres. An engaging tale about spying on your neighbours, which perhaps many of us are guilty of, James Stewart and Grace Kelly are timeless on screen. Is it paranoia or is it real ? If you're hindered and your leg is on a cast, will you take note of every single thing happening around you which may be only baseless, unfounded fear? Is there a killer on the loose? What are you going to do about it? These are the myriads of questions you ask when you watch this film. I am one of those skeptics when a Classic such as this gets adapted and recycled ( e.g. Disturbia with Shia Leboeuf )since there was only one Hitchcock, one James Stewart and one Grace Kelly. Go be creative and leave this Classic film alone."

avik-basu1889,"Dec 4, 2014",10/10,"A photographer named L.B. Jefferies has broken his leg. With nothing to do throughout the day, he starts observing his neighbours from his window which leads him to grow more and more suspicious about one particular neighbour's behaviour which leads to extremely suspenseful consequences.Clearly Hitchcock's theme for this film is voyeurism. We all have at least once watched someone from the window secretively. The thrill of observing people who are completely unaware of our peeping has always fascinated us. This very concept of intrusion of privacy has been the primary reason behind the success of the innumerable reality shows which have become so popular nowadays. The current scenario with reality shows makes Rear Window seem profound. The neighbourhood which is being observed by Jefferies is a representation of the whole society. There is the poor couple who struggle to get by,there is the rich lady who is tortured by her loneliness, there is the young ballet dancer who is trying to make her presence felt in the social scene, the musician who is desperate to achieve success with his talent, the old bickering couple and the young newlyweds.James Stewart has a commanding presence as Jefferies. Everyone knows about Grace Kelly's looks, but what is great about this film is that Kelly is not there just to look beautiful. She is actually the one who does all the physical thrilling dirty work while Stewart remains attached to his wheel chair.The screenplay by John Michael Hayes is absolutely brilliant. The whole story gets told from the point of view of Jefferies. This is a rare suspense thriller without any chases or thrilling action sequences. The movie depends completely on atmospheric tension. Hitchcock is not called the Master of Suspense for nothing. He shows how minimalistic filmmaking can also generate spine chilling moments of suspense. The film is grounded in realism. Although at first the other characters disapprove of Jefferies' obsession with keeping an eye on his neighbours, but gradually they also become addicted to this practice of voyeurism.Rear Window is arguably Alfred Hitchcock's best film(which is saying a lot). The movie grabs your attention immediately and never lets got of it. It is an immensely engaging watch and a genuine masterpiece."
ShanghaichickS,"Mar 1, 2004",8/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window is a definite classic. The movie is about a successful photographer with a broken leg, whom is stuck in his apartment in a cast for 6 weeks. 	This story takes place during a one-week period, where this man has nothing to do but to stair out of his back window of his living room into a courtyard that is in the center of other apartment complexes. What is seen in the other apartments is a mystery you will have to reveal on your own. And when you do; you will be stunned with that you've concluded. 	Alfred Hitchcock did a brilliant job filming this story, as he does with all of his films. The different techniques that he uses play such an enormous part in this film. For example: when the man in the apartment tries to hide in a particular scene from another man, instead of running to another room, he scoots himself into a shadow, and it is so much more practical. The shadow across his face adds suspense and mystery that running away does not.Another powerful touch on the film was the soundtrack. All of the music and noise that is heard in this video are all from something going on in the scene. Whether it is the tapping of a hand on a table, or a man in his apartment across the courtyard playing his piano. None of the music was added in, it is all from the scene. Very Powerful!!!The movie as a whole is not necessarily a spook, but more of a possible murder mystery. This film is very good and gripping. Even though its not exactly scary, it still draws in its viewer. 	It is definitely a Hitchcock classic that all should see. It is definetly a respected film because of the way it was filmed my Hitchcock. So definetly check it out, you will not be disappointed!"
arenn,"Sep 8, 2000",6/10,"I recently saw the restored print of this ""classic"" with some friends at the Music Box Theatre in Chicago.  After it was over, we all kind of stared at each other with slightly pained looks on our faces as if afraid to say what we really felt.  But none of us is truly that bashful about voicing opinions and it turned out we all shared the same one: namely that Rear Window was decent, but it was certainly no masterpiece and fell well short of our expectations.  I suspect the entire audience felt that way as there was very little crowd reaction to the film throughout and only polite applause at the end.  This is in marked contrast to the palpable thrill that the crowds at the Music Box's recent Kubrick film festival exhibited.I thought the film was slow paced and rather dull, and was over-dominated by subplots.  The suspense level was low throughout much of the film.  There were a few interesting vignettes about the lives of the various people who lived in the apartment building on the far side of the Greenwich Village courtyard, but ultimately these weren't enough to put this one into the above average category.I will confess that I've never been a big Hitchcock fan despite enjoying psychological thrillers.  So maybe that accounts for part of my shoulder shrug of this film.  Regardless, while I'm glad to have seen the film, I don't think I'll ever take the time to watch it again and I didn't come away impressed from my first screening."

Sophoclaw,"Jul 26, 2015",5/10,"I am aware that many people like this film a lot, and after many years it has indeed become a classic, and that's why I saw it for the first time yesterday. And I found it updated which is not very strange since we are talking about a film made in the early fifties. There is not much suspense in the plot mostly because as the story goes by, it is very obvious who the murderer is. The definition of suspense is: that the spectator should be guessing who the guilty person is, or even better: guessing who the bad guy is. In this film, we do know who the bad guy is, but we don't know if he really did it or not. Real suspense would have been that the guy that everyone thought that did it, in fact didn't, and that the one that looks innocent had done it. Now that would've been a twist! There are a couple of other things that killed the suspense in me. Why a man that is a photographer and tries to convince a policeman that his neighbour killed his wife and has no evidence and is looking through the window with a telephoto camera, doesn't take pictures of the scene of the crime and use them as evidence. And how come that a man that is going to murder his wife and cut her in small pieces doesn't draw down the window blinds so no one can see what he is doing and testify against him!?. But I have to admit, typically Hitchcock, delivers a proffesional job because he makes you see things that only a great director like him can. He will make you believe that Jeff and Lisa are absolutely right and everyone else is wrong just by watching this couple's attitude, created through their acting. And there is the strength of these actors; they are extremely reassuring in their personalities that as such, it impregnates the whole film. Just by the way they pose and sit and look you can almost smell that whatever they do is right. On the contrary, Thorwald hasn't a chance because from the very first scene he is doomed; he is the bad guy almost before the film has started. And I intuitively guessed it and killed all the suspense. I liked ""Vertigo"" even if some scenes are a little bit slow and long and I liked ""Psycho"", that's a masterpiece. But ""Rear Window"" it's too obvious."
barryrd,"Mar 1, 2009",9/10,"With the acting talent of two of Alfred Hitchcock's favourite actors, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly, and a strong supporting cast of Thelma Ritter, as his nurse, Cornell Wilde, the detective buddy, and Raymond Burr, a neighbouring tenant, we have the ingredients of a great movie. However, this movie is much more than a great cast since the directing genius of Hitchcock is more than evident. The location is in the Chelsea neighbourhood of Manhattan. The movie takes place on a small set-a bachelor apartment with distance scenes in the courtyard and other apartments seen through the lens of a camera. It seems a stretch that everyone in the complex would leave their blinds open but then, no one suspects that one tenant has a telephoto lens to zoom in on their private lives.Jeff, a photographer sidelined by an accident, takes to watching the antics of his neighbours in his spare time. The comic and the sad come together as his camera explores the rear window from one apartment to another. The neighbour he is mainly interested in is Lars Thorwald, played by Raymond Burr. Jeff believes he has killed his wife. Thorwald has no clue there is an intruder looking on from the other side of the courtyard. Raymond Burr gives a convincing portrayal of the sinister Mr. Thorwald - a far cry from the suave, courtly lawyer known on T. V. as Perry Mason. Grace Kelly, as Lisa Carol Freemont, enhances the look of this movie every time she walks on the set. In every scene, she appears like a model from the 1950's. I didn't count the number of costume changes she made but they must have been numerous and she made the most of each one, with due respect to Edith Head, Hitchcock's costume designer. She is a class act every time she appears and plays the role of the uptown Manhattan girl to a tee. The close-ups of her are eye candy of the first order. In fact, Jimmy Stewart hesitates to marry her because as he says, ""she's too perfect"". Thelma Ritter (Stella) as the housebound photographer's nurse/masseuse/housekeeper is an absolute marvel playing a shrewd devil's advocate to Jeff. During her career, she was nominated for several Academy Awards and is a rich talent, giving her own two cents worth on the love match between Lisa and Jeff, particularly Jeff's reluctance to wed.Some hands-on detective work by Lisa and Stella moves the story towards its climax. This classic movie will hold your interest from its amusing start to goose-bump finish. Along the way, there is a fine script and lots of wit. The vignettes involving the neighbours highlight the degree to which Jeff has taken to voyeurism, honing his observation of human behaviour. Photography forms a major role in this film, especially the use of the telephoto lens. Views through the camera form part of the key visuals. Hitchcock makes good use of the growing appreciation for professional photography as the skills of one photographer become the basis for a case of murder. This movie is full of repartee, humour, romance and some of the finest suspense in any Hitchcock film."
PeggyGoodwin,"Aug 29, 2010",10/10,"To take one movie set and transform it into a window to the world is genius.The intelligence, grace and beauty of Grace Kelly combined with the charm, talent and eloquence of James Stewart and the brilliance of the entire cast makes this a winner out of the gate. I have watched this film numerous times and never tire of it. Not so much because of the voyeurism, but the concern the lead characters display for their neighbors pulls at my heart, and that is all but lost today in movies and reality.I find myself relating to Lisa, a woman who for all intensive purposes does PR and falls for a photojournalist, Jeff. He tries to deter her love and admiration with all kinds of excuses why the don't go together. I find myself experiencing the same situation. Her love and devotion for this man was wonderful. A testament that we should never give up on the one we truly love!"
atlasmb,"Mar 21, 2015",10/10,"L. B. Jeffries (James Stewart) is a professional photographer who travels the world in search of the next conflict or adventure. But he is spending most of his time in a wheelchair, in his apartment, while his leg heals--the result of a photo assignment involving racecars. Outside his windows is an array of neighbors living their lives in their own apartments. Confined as he is, ""Jeff"" comes to view their activities as entertainment.He is visited regularly by Stella (Thelma Ritter), the insurance company nurse assigned to care for him. She administers massages and advice, telling Jeff he should ask his girlfriend, Lisa to marry him, and maybe he should spend less time spying on his neighbors, because she smells ""trouble"".But Jeff feels that he and Lisa (Grace Kelly) are too different from each other. She comes from the world of high fashion and refinement, whereas he lives his life (usually) on the go in danger and dirt.Besides wondering if he should break up with Lisa, Jeff's energies are directed mostly toward dealing with the summer heat and insufferable under-cast itching. But then he becomes caught up in the intrigue surrounding one neighbor. His own imagination runs wild, drawing him into the private drama outside his windows.This Hitchcock masterpiece spends some time wondering about the morality of spying on one's neighbors, but mostly it takes us deeper and deeper into Jeff's world and his suspicions about some curious comings and goings.Filmed from the point of view of Jeffries, ""Rear Window"" is a masterful film, filled with character studies and Hitchcock's economy of storytelling. The set is one of the best ever created. The music is wonderful, both in setting mood and in helping to create the world of the apartment complex. The story starts out lazily, then progressively becomes more and more urgent, building to a tense climax. Hitchcock is the master of suspense and this film is one of his best."
julie_comer,"Feb 20, 2005",10/10,"HITCHCOCK AT HIS BEST! I loved Psycho and Strangers on a Train, but I have to say I believe this one is the masterpiece in my opinion. James Stewart is unbelievable, a truly tremendous actor. Can you imagine being stuck in your apartment watching your neighbors across the way? Yes, I'm sure we have all done this but not quite what Jimmy sees in this movie. Thelma Ritter was fantastic, a true gem. Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever, flawless, and the perfect girlfriend. This movie sure keeps me on the edge of my seat, even though I have seen it before. This flick is what makes Hitchcock the man he is. I always love to keep a watch for his signature appearance. And talk about a steamy match with Stewart & Kelly!"
Vincentiu,"Nov 15, 2013",N/A,"it is a splendid masterpiece. for the play with details. for the exploitation of old/deep voyeurism as a cage for public. for the interesting performance of Thelma Ritter, and, sure, for Hitchcock mark. a story of a crime in different manner. a lot of ways, few levels of a common man life, Grace Kelly as blonde muse - her first scene is magnificent - and James Steward in admirable form for its special role. a puzzle, a lesson about relationship, a mirror for the need of everybody to know/search/debate the existence of other, a great construction - the apartments as a kind of metaphor but, more important, contemporary. a prediction, not different by Stella's but almost more cruel. smart, seductive, solid circle and beautiful. but not only beautiful. maybe, useful."
davidjkobb,"Jun 20, 2019",10/10,"Exceptionally engaging movie, with quick wit that hits the mark nearly every time, a story that draws you in like few others.A list of positives: Grace Kelly's beauty, supremely rewatchable, the nurse's humor, Hitchock's perfect touch, the writing, the scenery, the cinematography, the score. It's damn near a perfect film.Negatives: darn near nothing."
ElMaruecan82,"Mar 31, 2012",10/10,"An everyday man trapped in an out-of-control situation, a cool and sophisticated blonde with a burning flame and a heart-pounding paranoid sensation driving the narrative until a suffocating and suspenseful climax. On the surface, ""Rear Window"" is made of the same usual Hitchcockian ingredients, but the film has a specificity that elevates it above all the other Hitchcock experiences and best exemplifies his brilliance as a director and a storyteller.The secret of ""Rear Window""'s timeless appeal relies on its self-reflexive approach to whatever defined Hitchcock's style, in the first place, the identification with the hero. Here, we root for L.B. ""Jeff"" Jefferies, not just because he's an ordinary man, but also because he's stuck in a condition similar to us with his leg casted after a car accident. He's still above ordinariness through his job, he's a photographer and from what it seems, quite an adventurer, the very cause of his accident happens to be due to his closeness to a car just to get the perfect shot. His métier, cleverly hinted in the opening scene with the shots on his material and pictures, is the perfect device to justify the presence of binoculars, and sort of redeem Jeffries' voyeurism by translating it into a simple case of job conditioning. But apart from these considerations, it's still not Jeffries the photographer whom we identify with, but Jeffries, the man.The man can't move, can't wear other clothes than his pajamas, a nice visual touch that makes the film even more memorable, he can't go outside and basically, he's condemned for a seven-week passivity. Therefore, the only area of freedom that is offered to him is to watch his neighbors from the titular window, and discovering their private lives. Hitchcock uses a clever plot device by setting the film in a hot summer week so it justifies why all the windows are open. We discover a beautiful neighborhood setting where each window represents a little vignette of action within a movie, there is Miss Lonelyhearts, the old maid seeking love desperately, Miss Torso, a pretty dancer who invites many guys at parties, a couple of newlyweds, another used to sleep in a balcony and owning a little pet dog, and there are the Thornwalds, the typical constantly-arguing couple. If only for the setting, the film is a remarkable technical and artistic achievement.Now, ""Rear Window"" doesn't question if watching the neighbors is morally defendable, Hitch is just stating the obvious, if we were put in Jeffries' situation, we would watch, because human nature has a tendency for voyeurism. It kind of reminds me of the French adage that says: 'when I see myself, I feel bad, when I see the others, I feel better'. Jeffries seems to enjoy watching people precisely to reconcile himself with his own condition. It's human and this is where we identify with him, especially when Hitchcock tricks us into admiring the voluptuous body of Miss Torso, or laugh at the couple caught by the rain. We're even more voyeur when we tend not to see what's wrong inside us, and this is the psychological dimension that enriches an already clever script. More than a mystery, ""Rear Window"" acts as an excellent character study and introspection into the mechanism of voyeurism. And the two female characters play a significant part by indirectly mirroring Jeffries' inner weaknesses that we'd notice if we weren't too busy watching what he watches.The first one is Thelma Ritter as Stella the no-nonsense caregiver who can't understand many of Jeffries' attitudes: why doesn't he marry Lisa, if she loves her? Why is he spending time watching other people, it will only cause trouble (and we know it will). Stella is the common sense of the story, and the reflection of Jeffries' own indecision. Lisa, on the other hand, provides the romantic aspect of the film, which is essential -her entrance with this extraordinary close-up is one of the most beautiful from any film-, Lisa is a fashion designer, elegant and classy, she spoils Jeffries, bringing a whole restaurant to his modest room, but he doesn't share her passion and doesn't feel like she could follow him. They love each other but they can't make up their minds, and while we see them arguing about the way to handle their relationship, we –viewers- experience exactly what Jeffries does every day.Indeed, Jeffries embodies our own perspective, and the neighbor's windows symbolize what we see on-screen. The film is remarkably told in focal perspective where we're put in the same position than the character, and the directing, rightfully Oscar-nominated, is particularly attentive to very simple but subtle details. Basically, each important moment of Jeffries' watching is regulated in three times, he sees- we see what he sees and then his reaction (a smile, a surprise, a shock ) betrays his interpretation. A voice-over would have cheated with the concept, now we only see and try to figure out what happened from what he saw. And when Thornwald leaves the house many times during a rainy night, taking saw and ropes, and suddenly his wife isn't here for the next days, anyone can get suspicious. But Hitch also teases us by showing us things that gets unnoticed by Jeffries. We're frustrated because we know something he doesn't and can't do anything, we're powerless, but ironically, so is Jeffries.And this is where the power of the climax relies, because Jeffries can't do anything, he can't move, he can't even cry for help if he becomes the watched or if he sees his beloved Lisa in danger in Thronswald's house. The suspense here allows us to experiment the viewer's condition on the character and uses the romance to drive the narrative: Lisa becoming a bit of an adventurer and Jeffries starting to put his own troubles and torments into perspective, and learning that any watcher should watch himself first  which of course, applies for us too."
pyrocitor,"May 14, 2007",10/10,"Only in the hands of master filmmaker Alfred Hitchcock could a seemingly simple tale about a man in a wheelchair watching his neighbours be twisted into a captivating tale of suspense and intrigue, mixed with a sturdy backbone of moral and ethical dilemmas and a social commentary on the culture that would be viewing the film. Hitchcock, who was notorious for mixing in such deeper themes with seemingly superficial suspense epics seemed to particularly relish the tale of Rear Window, a film entirely devoted to a man simply watching. At first glance, the plot sounds overly contrived, even downright dull, but under Hitchcock's careful grasp, the film never drifts into anything less than crackling with low key intrigue and tension - but always equally thought provoking as well as entertaining throughout.Rear Window proved innovative in film-making style as well as supremely entertaining movie - a masterpiece in pacing, as well as a unique narrative style. The story plays itself out as a murder mystery, but as the plot unfolds, the solution remains abundantly clear to the audience watching the events transpire. Rather than throwing in a hackneyed forced plot twist near the end, Hitchcock is content to simply let the climax unfold exactly as the viewer would have predicted all along - after all, the joy of the film is not solving a mystery, but merely observing the murderous event itself transpire. In a day and age grown so accustomed to climatic plot twists, the absence of any is in itself more of a surprise than another forced plot twist would have been. Unfortunately, one of the film's minuscule flaws is that its ending comes across as a touch abrupt and forced; a minor lapse in pacing in a film which proves an otherwise stellar example of it.But Hitchcock is not content with simply telling his story in an innovative fashion - his trademark deeper and darker themes make their way into a story which seems deceptively simple, brilliantly written by John Michael Hayes. In many ways, the premise of Rear Window serves as a social commentary on mass culture: people love to watch. How else to explain the enormous generation of income of the film industry than the general public's fascination with the stories of other people; often moreso than in their own lives. James Stewart's character seems to act as a representation of most audience members - too captivated by the social dramas of his neighbours and the glamour of potential murder (another trademark Hitchcock theme) to pay attention to his own life.And there is no denying that it is enjoyable to watch, as we, the audience, get easily drawn into the private lives of these seemingly inconsequential characters (""Miss Torso"", ""Ms. Lonelyhearts"" and ""The Pianist"" as Stewart refers to them) framed by the spectacular cinematography, all shot from the room of Stewart's apartment - another reference as to how little it takes to entertain an audience. Indeed, Rear Window seems to serve as a precursor to the world of reality television, and the fascination ensuing from watching shows such as Survivor or Big Brother - simply observing ""real life"" as it is billed.Hitchcock also raises moral issues as to the ethics of observing to the point of intrusion of privacy in a scene where Stewart debates the ethics of spying on his neighbours, even if he may bring a murderer to justice. Hitchcock seems to be silently making raising the question to his audiences - we are a culture that loves to watch, but is it always right to watch, and are we always meant to see what we see? Whatever decisions or interpretations audiences may take out of Hitchcock's social commentaries, their mere presence in the film make the unfolding of the plot that much more interesting to follow, and add strongly to the quality of the film overall.An already brilliantly realized film is only made more powerful by the immensely capable cast - James Stewart proves perfect casting as the ornery yet charming L. B. Jeffries, the wheelchair bound photographer with a bizarre interest in his neighbours' private lives, determined to prove one of them to be a murderer. The peerlessly elegant Grace Kelly brings sheer class to the film as Jeffries' socialite girlfriend, though how could Jeffries ever be capable of pushing such an ideal woman away, and why she continue to be interested in one who comes across as a cranky older man is truly a question for the ages. Character actress Thelma Ritter proves an unquestionable scene stealer, raising many a laugh and making use of many of the film's best lines as Jeffries' unassuming but sharp tongued nurse. Wendell Corey is a similarly strong presence as Jeffries' detective friend who is eventually drawn into the conflict. Raymond Burr, seen almost entirely in extreme long shots still establishes himself as a formidable and intimidating presence as the suspected murderer, and some of the suspenseful scenes involving his character are some of the best nail biting sequences Hitchcock ever churned up. All the supporting players, also seen only in long shots still manage to draw the audience into their personal lives, forcing them to care even when they realize they should be observing dispassionately - an inspired directorial touch.All in all Rear Window proves to be one of Hitchcock's most fascinating yet philosophical films in a career demonstrating many of the same traits. Though Rear Window may sound slow and uninteresting at first glance, there is a certain fascination the film evokes which triggers inevitable repeat viewing after viewing. This is one window which demands looking into.-10/10"
jzappa,"Sep 2, 2008",10/10,"I am sitting here wondering why I am commenting on Alfred Hitchcock's Rear Window. It is a definitive classic of enduring interest, quality, and style. The last sentence is as redundant as this review will be. I mean, what can I say that not only hasn't already been said but isn't already known? Its masterful voyeuristic cinematography, its impeccably atmospheric sound and John Michael Hays's screen adaptation of Cornell Woolrich's short story have been quite sufficiently recognized over the past half century. I suppose there is one thing that people don't tend to think about, or at least it is one thing I haven't heard anyone say, and that is that Rear Window is a virtuoso portrait the human element of privacy, and feeling naked when we notice that it is invaded. What's more, that invasion is another element of human nature: Voyeurism.What else is left to debate for incessantly lovable Jimmy Stewart, a successful photographer whose restlessness takes him all over the world and into situations where he takes pictures no one else gets, recuperating from a broken leg during a scorching hot summer? Here is a restless daredevil who makes a living with his eyes, laid up in a wheelchair in a small, apartment. This is 1954. He's not going to sit at the computer and blast people on IMDb message boards. He does what any one of his neighbors could be found doing in his situation: Alleviating boredom by spying on the lives of his neighbors. Furthermore, his view is perfect! Through his rear window, he can see into the building across the courtyard of the complex and glimpse from front row seats the residents' daily routines. There's the ubersexy dancer who exercises in her underwear, the couple who sleep on their small balcony because they don't have air conditioning, a lonely woman who lives by herself (who alternately gains great sympathy from us and generates cruel laughs at her expense; true to the spirit of voyeurism), and a frustrated songwriter always at his piano. And, there is the salesman, a pitch-perfect Raymond Burr, who lives directly across the courtyard from Jimmy Stewart, the one with the pesky, harassing invalid wife.I can safely assume that nearly everyone who reads this generally knows the gist of the plot. It is a fine plot, ever condusive to everything Hitchcock. What is so significant about it to me is how it takes two seemingly conflicting sides of human nature and turns the suspenseful corner by dangling by a thread the inevitable, which is that an everyday person, no matter how fixed they are in their day-by-day algorithms, just may eventually discover that feeling of nakedness, of intrusion.Though there are films by Hitchcock that I favor more, like The Lady Vanishes, Shadow of a Doubt, and Rope, Rear Window stands as pure cinema: Blatantly and shamelessly visual, full of layers of audible details from the ambient to deafening."
OllieSuave-007,"Mar 10, 2015",10/10,"Rear Window is one of Alfred Hitchcock's greats, a story where photographer Jeff Jeffries (James Stewart) spends his time looking out of his apartment window while confined to his wheelchair (due to a broken leg). While observing his neighbors, he grows suspicious of Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) and believes he may have murdered his wife.From Jeff and fashion consultant girlfriend Lisa Fremont's (Grace Kelly) dramatic talks of their relationship in the beginning to them getting themselves involved in the alleged murder case, Hitchcock brilliantly combines drama and thrills in the movie that, as a result, will keep you engaged from start to finish.Hitchcock keeps the suspense going throughout the film, filling you with intrigue and making you guess if Thorwald really committed the heinous deeds as Jeff describes. There is also humor in abundance in the form of acid wit, quick comebacks and sarcasm delivered by the movie leads, especially that of Thelma Ritter. It puts added charm in this thriller and it will make you laugh and fill you with suspense at the same time.Hands-down to the very clever and decent acting - each actor gave a memorable performance, from the witty James Stewart to the spellbinding Grace Kelly, and from the cynical Thelma Ritter to the mysterious Raymond Burr.For a movie made in 1954, it holds up very well throughout the test of time. Go watch it!Grade A"
Red_Identity,"May 22, 2010",N/A,"This is the 3rd Hitchcock film I have seen, and like I predicted, it is a great film. The dialogue between the two main characters is smooth and engaging, and the mystery is riveting and suspenseful. Hitchcock is a master at suspense of course, and this film is no exception. The set design and the cinematography allowing the viewer to witness all of the different characters living in this neighborhood is simply amazing and unforgettable, and Hitchcock was able to really pull me into every scene. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are magnificent together and I loved how the film had just as much intimacy and romance as mystery. Outstanding film!"
JuguAbraham,"Apr 17, 2006",7/10,"After my third viewing of the film over a span of 20 odd years, I went beyond appreciating the cinematic challenges that Hitchcock sets for himself to overcome. For instance, I was not appreciating that this film is one of the rare instances in cinema where all the sounds are ""diegetic"" recorded on the soundtrack.are sounds from within the visual world captured by the camera. After the earlier viewings, I was no longer intrigued by the amoral perspective of the voyeur, represented by L.B. Jefferies (James Stewart), the good, average American bachelor with a robust, modest, creative career and a rich doting girl friend, Lisa, trying to rope him into marriage. No longer was blending of the viewer's perspective and that of Jefferies' perspective a major feat of Hitchcock.My third viewing threw up new perspectives of the film because I had now got to see over 20 Hitchcock films.First, ""Rear window"" is one of the rare films of Hitchcock where women emerge smarter and stronger than menthe last scene has the hero with two legs in a cast and his lady love switching reading material to what she prefers to read over what the hero would prefer her to read, even though for the first time she has switched to trousers to humor her future husband's vision of his kind of wife. Similar ends were obvious in ""Family Plot,"" ""Spellbound,"" ""Rebecca"" and, by inference of the final choice, in ""Marnie."" The final shot in ""Rear window"" is a sexual reversal of the final shot of ""Mr and Mrs Smith.""Second, ""Rear window"" is yet another film on marriagea recurring theme in Hitchcock's films. Jefferies and Lisa do not tie the knot but the end inferred this would eventually happen. But the switching of the reading material gives the viewer a clue who among the duo would rule the marriage. In another perspective on marriage, within the film a husband kills his wife. A wedding ring is stolen of all objects. Other perspectives in the film reflect on the sex in marriage and another looks at a woman dreaming of a virtual husband, a dream to which Jefferies involuntarily raises his own glass!Third, this is a film on photographers, photography and voyeurs. Only the photographer looks out of the window, when all have windows open, except when a dog or housebreak is involved. Many years after Hitchcock made the film, the Polish director Krystof Kiesolwski in his ""Dekalog no. 6"" explored the same theme with astonishing results. Recently, Austrian filmmaker Michael Hanneke's ""Cache"" presented videos of an anonymous voyeur as the pivotal essay on racial interaction. All the three films infer that the crime is in watching other people commit crime. The watcher and the watched emerge as flip sides of an individual or alter egos."
Doylenf,"Aug 26, 2006",8/10,"While I thoroughly enjoyed REAR WINDOW and think it's among Hitch's best films, I always observe how easy it was for Stewart's character to view the lives around him. It seems that nobody in the entire neighborhood ever heard of keeping curtains or window blinds in more discreet positions. We are forced to believe that all of these people leave their windows totally exposed to the naked eye even though they face an apartment building not more than fifty feet away, and even when scantily clad or seeking a romantic rendezvous.Of course, little do they suspect that a wheelchair-bound photographer is stalking them through his binoculars and keeping tabs on their everyday quirks and foibles. This is where the story taps into the psyche of the main character, brilliantly played by JAMES STEWART.He gets excellent support from a first-rate cast, although I think GRACE KELLY was a bit arch as his female companion. However, it's RAYMOND BURR (as a man Stewart suspects has killed his wife), JUDITH EVELYN (as ""Miss Lonelyhearts""), WENDELL COREY (as a skeptical detective), and most of all, THELMA RITTER as a wise-cracking nurse, who really stir things up.Hitchcock shows complete control of his camera, forcing us to view everything just the way Stewart sees things and focusing our attention where it ought to be through the development of the story, which is loosely based on a Cornel Woolrich short story.It's the kind of film where you have to be watching and on the alert all the time so as not to miss anything.Highly satisfying and typically good Hitchcock suspense that builds to a tense stand-off at the climax."
billion_mucks,"Dec 3, 2007",9/10,"Hitchock's smart review on voyeurism and human composed need for entertainment is fantastically stamped within ""Rear Window"". Those who see just a suspense story will overlook the most important backbone of the movie itself: the arrangement of a fauna of great, interesting human beings, each with their problems, happiness and something to scoop on.The story quickly digests important views where a man with his broken leg gets no other option than to spend time watching and examining his neighbors' life. Before Television arrived, this endearing inspection like Big Brother brings the fantastic nexus that ties up the story. But there will be a transformation where the watching will transform into an obsession, and the most inner feelings of connection with the other will be arisen by what we call voyeurism, or morbidness. We will unite sober James Stewart in his progressive burial over the neighborhood's secrets.There is in the movie one crucial analogy: the eyes watching the window. The eyes are subjective, and see what the mind wants to see. Curiously, eyes are the so called windows of the souls. Whereas the window exposes the reality, the fact to be interpreted (in many ways): here ambiguity strikes and in Jeffries situation it will present itself in the mood of paranoia. All of this scrutinizing over the others life is presented as unethical, but irresistible. Hitchcock uses Franz Waxman's moody music to alter the spectator's disposition to each scene, that lightens throughout the chilling sessions and paralyzes within the climax moments. There is a sense of fear, of being also observed and panicking of being discovered while enjoying the watch. The story seems possible and everyday, presented in a superb way, it will be more effective than what you expect it so. The photography is immense, roaming delicately over the used setting profiting on the smooth editing. We also can expect the most sophisticated and somewhat naive sense of humor to lighten the sordid tension of the movie.""Rear Window"" lives clearly up to the reputation. It is a movie to be examined closely and enjoyed with a good glass of freezing cold water to set the mood right. I believe the movie is somewhat of a time capsule, a very good one indeed, because it has gone over more than fifty years since released, and its a beautiful way of being entertained as it paints a wonderful picture of the era: the way they talked, they dressed, they spent their time. Time cannot falter pieces of art as this one. It renders past oblivion."

ajkbiotech,"Apr 23, 2021",10/10,"Based upon a.1942 Cornell Woolrich story, ""It Had to Be Murder,"" REAR WINDOW is one of the very greatest of Alfred Hitchcock's many great films.We originally saw the film in it's 1983-84 theatrical re-release run, which was most fortuitous.Seeing this film on the big screen in an art house theater, as we saw it, in the 1980s, an experience not often shared today by movie goers, was a revelation.The cinematography was brilliant, the colors rich and real.Grace Kelly has never looked better or more seductive. Cary Grant is brilliant as the laid up wheelchair bound boyfriend of Grace Kelly who takes an interest in his neighbors' goings ons, originally from boredom, eventually engrossing even his girlfriend Grace Kelly in his oh so naughty hobby.The rest of the film I leave to the viewing public, but suffice it to say, it is a remarkable tour de force.Genius, sheer genius, buttressed by great film angles, cinematography & superb acting.Just a perfect film."
chaswe-28402,"Mar 17, 2019",10/10,"One reviewer has pointed out that anyone who wanted to spy on his neighbours would surely prevent them from spying back on him. In fact everyone in this courtyard seems to perform in full exposure --- although there are one or two occasional exceptions. It is explained it is because the weather was very hot.The fan-like structure of this movie is creative. The central theme, played out between Stewart and Kelly, concerns the relationship between the sexes. Every playlet observed through the window, offers an ingenious courtyard commentary on the variety of these relationships, from celibate solitude, via frantic partying, through loneliness, newly-weds and long-term marriage, to marital murder. The little dog seems to take the place of a kid; kids being otherwise relegated to the half-seen street at the back.The dog, and its fate, is one of the two mysteries in the plot. What was the point of killing the little dog ? Why did murderer Burr bury something in a flower-bed ? What was it ? Did I miss something ? Seems completely pointless. He got rid of everything else by other means, simply enough. The other mystery which no-one seems to mention, concerns the curious black-clad female figure at one point seen emerging with Burr from his flat. Who was that ? Did I miss something ? Brilliant film, though. I like Grace Kelly. She is civilised because she says either, not eether."
arijitbiswas-76811,"Aug 12, 2022",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's 1954 classic Rear Window is the ultimate reflection of human conscience. As the protagonist continues to violate the privacies of other people, we also continue to take part in this voyeurism. And as the protagonist develops the sense of justification by saying ""What else to do?"" we also do the same by watching the film of it's entirety. We may escape our guilt and uphold our moral conscience saying that we are not in the wrong as we're not the one committing this immoral activity but the silent observer is as guilty as the criminal themselves.I've never felt so manipulated by a movie since Michael Hanake's Funny Games."
kahurst,"Jan 26, 2007",6/10,"I'm 47 years old and have just recently started to try and experience some of the three and four star older movies which is pre-1970 for me. One thing that I have learned is that you have to give them a little more time. There were several times in the first hour or so that I almost gave up on it, but once things started happening, it was just as exciting and sometimes even more so than current action films today. I've heard so much about Grace Kelly and she really was wonderful in this movie. Biographies have said that she truly missed being an actress after her marriage, and you can tell in this movie how much she loved her craft. Jimmy Stewart plays the part well, although it is hard to imagine that someone like Grace Kelly would be interested in him. I loved the character of the nurse, Stella. The storyline really started moving once all three actors were involved. All in all an enjoyable movie."
KoolCatReviews,"May 7, 2020",8/10,At times this movie seems way ahead of its time. Camera work is great and pioneering and holds up to even today's standards. The sets desgin works perfectly with the story shown with in the film. Evenly paced with no cheap gimmicks or tricks. The dialogue suffers alittle at times and is confusing however all the characters are well defined. Towards the end of the movie some really bad primal CGI is used and the tension didn't hold out like I had hoped. A very decent movie so don't be put off that is was filmed in 50's as it holds up so well against movies produced much later.
yavkaconsult,"Dec 14, 2023",6/10,"""Rear Window (1954) is a decidedly well written and no less well directed mystery thriller. It definitely grabs the viewer's attention right from the start.I know and realize that the director of this film, Alfred Hitchcock, was chasing suspense or great twists, but to be honest, I didn't really feel them here. The whole story was very clear to me. I mean, I understood from the beginning what was going to happen. That in no way made me not enjoy watching this movie, but I certainly wouldn't include it in my best movie category.""Rear Window"" is well made, it's interesting, but it's not much and I don't understand why it's so overpraised... Maybe because it's too famous and most people haven't seen really BRILLIANT similar films from the same genre.Final score: 6/10."
Mr-Fusion,"Aug 22, 2018",8/10,"I was fairly young when I first watched ""Rear Window""; early enough that the sheer radiance of Grace Kelly was my primary takeaway.But as an adult, it's easy to see why this movie is taught in film school; the gliding camerawork, the lighting, the mise en scène. Hitchcock's use of framing is nothing short of brilliant, and draws you into the story from the very beginning (such a seduction is key to the fun of all of this).One thing that really stood out to me was the ability to create the vibe of that sweltering Summer day, given that this was shot on a soundstage. And speaking of, that set is amazing. It'd have to be, given how long the camera lingers, but still, impressive production design nonetheless.There was much more to appreciate this time around. It's tense, engrossing and technically masterful. And Grace Kelly still lights up the screen."
Lejink,"Jun 15, 2021",9/10,"One of Hitchcock's abiding masterpieces where he got everything just about right, from the screenplay, cast and above all execution of his ideas. He exposes the voyeur in himself but also in the viewer by pointing his subjective camera at the occupants of a block of flats which sits directly opposite James Stewart's crocked photo-journalist, L. B. Jeffries. Laid up in a cast after an accident at his last assignment, assimilated in a brilliant panning shot around the objects in his flat, he's bored rigid and thirsting for action. With his enforced fixed location, adjacent telephoto lens and I presume lack of television, he's drawn to the lives of the neighbours right in front of him, going about their everyday lives unaware of the prying eyes looking in from across the way.The only company L. B. receives is from his masseuse, the worldly, feisty Thelma Ritter and his glamorous, beautiful girlfriend, played by a luminous Grace Kelly. Kelly's Lisa Fremont is mad for L. B. and wants to marry him but he's cool on the idea, suspecting her of being a shallow, domesticated fashion-obsessed airhead and a poor fit for his preferred exciting life-style.Then a particular couple in his eyeline catch his attention, Raymond Burr's Lars Thorwald and the prickly relationship he has with his bedridden wife. They clearly don't get on, she forever nagging him while he seems to have another chick on the side. When the wife disappears and Thorwald is seen to be acting suspiciously, at least in Jeffries' eyes, it's not long before the journalist in him thinks he's onto a real-live murder case so that sure enough he tries to inveigle a cop friend, Wendell Corey as well as Kelly and Ritter into believing him.It's just a wonderful movie, with the Master clearly on top-form throughout. From the opening image of Stewart's restricted viewpoint, to the classy cinematography and fluid camerawork, sharp, at times risqué and darkly humorous dialogue and top acting by not only the leads but also all of those who act out their little vignettes, it's just about the perfect thriller, with more than a little concealed subversion, for good measure."
jeffjr-92458,"Jan 30, 2022",10/10,He examined one of the most difficult would-you-rather questions - one so genius that no one before his time even considered. Would you rather sleep with the most beautiful woman on the planet or spy on your neighbor?
charlesturner-75605,"Sep 11, 2022",8/10,"What a very interesting piece of cinema. Doesn't disappoint. I love how invested the main character is with watching his neighbors how he stumbles upon finding the neighbor who he thinks killed his wife. And as we further progress into the movie we find the plot thickens and thickens. The ending was satisfying and there was a nice twist with one of the other neighbors who will remain nameless or was referred to as the ""lonely hearts woman"". I especially enjoyed the cinematography with the camera shots from the views through the lenses of the photos. That was pretty nice. I'll admit the start of the movie was slow but as it progressed I found myself becoming more intrigued and engrossed in the thought of ""how did this man kill his wife""?"
stewart-189,"Jan 24, 2022",9/10,"I've seen the film once before. This last time I watched it and couldn't get over a couple things. First, if Stewart and Kelly were so concerned about everything going on in the other apartments, especially Thorwald's movements, why did they sit there with the lights on the entire movie observing all the comings and goings while thinking no one could see them. And the biggest disappointment for me, as a professional photographer, was to see ""Jeffries"" who supposedly traveled the world as an assignment photographer not know how to handle his camera. He held the Exacta as if it was a large sausage. With the large telephoto lens attached I think Stewart was more afraid he would drop it. He never held the camera with his right hand wrapped around the camera body and his index finger poised on the trigger button. The image shown of his view through the lens was round as if seen through a telescope instead of rectangular as seen through a 35mm camera frame. Could not any of the cinematographers on the crew instructed him in how to hold the camera? I was stunned at that obvious flub. He seemed to figure out the flash gun and how to change the bulbs and trigger the lights in the villain' s eyes. Bummer for me! The rest of the film was genius?"
Tolispro,"Mar 30, 2019",10/10,"This movie has you on the edge of your seat with every little thing that plays on. It's chilling and thrilling in every scene and towards the end you are uncertain of what will happen to the protagonists. Hitchcock's genius is shown in the film every time the camera turns. It's the illusion of voyeurism that keeps us watching. The ability to see what happens without being seen. You start to care about the characters as soon as the film starts. Marriage is the theme overshadowed by murder. James Stewart's finest performance if you ask me and the captivating Grace Kelly as beautiful as ever. This movie is 65 years old, but if you watched the movie without knowing the date of the release, you wouldn't think of it to be older than 10 years old. It has stand the test of time again and again and it has come out victorious. I guess what I am really saying is...if you haven't watched it yet--what have you been doing?"
Felix-Wackenhuth,"Mar 24, 2025",6/10,"I was actually a bit disappointed. This movie is probably one of the most casual crime stories i have ever watched, without anything really happening.To start of with the good things. I really liked the idea of the story playing out in one place, the open neighborhood makes the atmosphere of the movie super cozy. And you can't of course not mention the directing style of Hitchcock - like the glove on the hand.Otherwise is the story not good by any measures. The plot points are not vibrant at all, and you could sniff the ending by a mile away. This being rated as Hichkocks second to best movie is just crazy if you compare it to some of hes other works. I might just be spoiled by some of todays thrillers, but this way just from beginning to end just blend."
jordondave-28085,"Mar 9, 2023",10/10,"(1954) Rear Window
SUSPENSE/ MYSTERY/ COMEDYThe most popular director Alfred Hitchcock had ever done and is probably one of his finest, if not influential. This film which started a whole slew of other 'Peeping Tom' movies like the teenager film from 2007 ""Disturbia"" to the chilling 1960 film ""Peeping Tom"" starring Carl Boehm and Moira Shearer and ""Body Double"" directed by Brian DePalma. The film that started it all starring James Stewart and the ravishing Grace Kelly can also be personified as who they're in real life, using their real life personas to liven the story, like for example when Jeff (James Stewart) tells Leeza Freemont (Grace Kelly) that she belongs to this luxurious lifestyle who Jeff is not, just so he could find a excuse not to be with her, she denies these kind of comments and becomes very stubborn and really want to be with Jeff. I mention this because in real life, Grace Kelly does marry an actual Prince of Monaco and James Stewart went to war serving his country during WWII. This film is a natural reflection of who they're and is used to great effect to enhance the story because the audience identifies with them, for the exception of Raymond Burr as the suspect who may or may have not have murdered his wife."
Hildebrando_Martins_Almeida,"Mar 31, 2024",10/10,"""Rear Window"", directed by Alfred Hitchcock and released in 1954, continues to captivate audiences decades after its release. Critics praise its modernity, narrative fluidity, and inventiveness. This film noir classic is a masterpiece that transcends generations, captivating both casual viewers seeking entertainment and more discerning intellectuals seeking deeper meaning.The plot, based on a story by Cornell Woolrich, follows a photographer, brilliantly portrayed by James Stewart, who, confined to a wheelchair after an accident, spends his time observing his neighbors through his window. This seemingly simple premise unfolds into an intricate tale of voyeurism, suspicion, and suspense as the protagonist becomes convinced that one of his neighbors has committed a crime.Hitchcock's genius lies in how he turns the screen into an extension of the protagonist's vision, immobilized in his wheelchair. The windows of the neighboring apartments become like movie screens, where the photographer, and by extension the viewer, witnesses a variety of human dramas. This dynamic between observer and observed reflects the relationship between the audience and the characters in the cinematic experience.One of the most fascinating aspects of the film is its ability to provoke multiple layers of interpretation. On one level, it is a gripping story of mystery and intrigue, with sharp dialogue and moments of subtle humor. On another level, it is a profound reflection on human nature, its hidden desires, and the ethics of observation.Grace Kelly's performance also stands out, her elegant and magnetic presence adding an extra dimension to the film. Her partnership with Hitchcock, evidenced by the meticulous choice of her wardrobe and attention to detail on screen, is an essential part of the film's charm and visual appeal.Behind the scenes, Hitchcock was at the height of his career, enjoying collaboration with his muse Grace Kelly and the creative freedom the film afforded. His obsessive care with every aspect of the production, from the script to the editing, resulted in a masterpiece that continues to be studied and appreciated to this day.In summary, ""Rear Window"" is more than a film; it is a celebration of the power of cinema to captivate, provoke, and deliver pleasure to the audience. With its engaging narrative, talented cast, and masterful direction, it is a lasting testament to Alfred Hitchcock's genius and the magic of cinema as an art form."
matthewssilverhammer,"Dec 16, 2020",10/10,"Rear Window isn't just impeccable entertainment; it might also be the apex of visual storytelling. Hitchcock's work in the '20s is on full display, each apartment its own silent film. Stewart, Kelly & the wonderful Ritter are the filmgoer stand-ins with a fantasy twist: longing to know the ending, going into the story, & even affecting the outcome. Hitch's oft-explored bipolar emotions on voyeurism (perverse / judgmental) have never been more potent; boredom, sexuality, paranoia, jealousy."
colinschmaltz,"Feb 11, 2021",10/10,This movie is amazing every small detail they throw at you that starts off as being insignificant has a great payoff and gets you more invested in the story. James Stewart and Grace Kelly are magical in this. Alfred Hitchcock has well earned his title as the master of suspense putting him up their with Agatha Christie and in my eyes earns the title of the Shakespeare of filmmaking.
h-28658,"Apr 25, 2020",8/10,"The story is so detailed and meticulously recreated on the screen, that it holds you from the beginning till the end. Though it seems a bit naive from time to time from the modern viewer's point of view, it was a genuine novelty at the time, providing so much detail and bringing such a subtle psychological narrative to the screen."
MrMockalite,"Aug 1, 2003",N/A,"Why is this movie considered so great? The people that praise it are hoity-toity pretentious ""film buffs"". I thought the acting was great, and the cinematography was excellent, but I was not on the edge of my seat at all during this film. It was not suspenseful, as I could tell what was going to happen, and I never felt worried about any of the characters because I could tell they would be saved in one way or another."
Girl Friday,"Feb 2, 2002",6/10,A man witnesses what he believes is a murder in an apartment building behind his.  The romance makes for an interesting subplot also showing up its era. Grace Kelly plays a society sweetheart who has fallen for a photographer. She wants to marry and he doesn't.  She imagines him as a fashion photographer in a suit and married to her.  James Stewart plays the 'louse' who declares she could never follow him through the middle east photographing on dangerous assignments and he could never fit into her ideal.  Far from wanting to break-up he asks her to keep things 'status quo'.  There's an interesting scene between his police detective friend and her overnight bag.  But this is the movies - he has to marry her!

ines_fr,"May 13, 2020",9/10,"A movie where the protagonist spends the all movie sitted in wheelchair and looking through the window... It seems to have everything to be boring, but not with Hitchcock!This movie is utterly entertaining and suspensful, always with the question ""Did he? Didn't he?"" and groundbreaking in many aspects regarding the norms and standards of 1950's cinema.An extremely clever, sharp and funny movie that takes the common voyarism to an all other level with a great amount of suspense."
p_adkins2004,"Feb 22, 2007",8/10,"This film is pretty much set in Jefferies flat throughout the whole 2 hours (reminding me somewhat of The Glass Menagerie, which is never a good thing), and no shot outside of the apartment block is shot, and although Hitchcock ensures the audience aren't too aware of this, it doesn't help the static feeling that this film creates.The most interesting level to the flick is the relationship between Jefferies and his girlfriend, which at the start of the film is mismatched, disjointed and mainly physical (Kelly's sexuality is on full display here), yet through the supposedly horrific circumstances they are able to use murder as a lubrication to a better relationship. Kelly especially seems aware of this yet, almost acknowledging the sacrifice of a life as a fair act for the salvation of their relationship. In many ways this complex relationship means the murder itself plays second fiddle.The murder plot itself is fairly basic and uninspiring, yet it is the unlikable Jefferies response to the proceedings which mean the viewer doesn't lose interest.Compared to many of Hitchcock's true classics this film does not have a tense edge to it (not to the modern audience anyway, when the idea of voyeurism or being watched all the time is reality not fantasy), till the final 10 minutes of climax. Perhaps the idea of being watched from afar is accepted to the point where the pivotal point of the flick is somewhat lost."
daoldiges,"Feb 11, 2022",9/10,"The suspense in Rear Window enters very slowly, almost timidly. As it builds we have a wonderfully innovative and interesting single set piece to digest. Along with an exceptionally captivating Grace Kelly, looking and performing at her best. The direction, lighting, timing, sound effects all blend together harmoniously to create a very special film. Definitely worth checking out."
alexanderliljefors,"Mar 3, 2024",9/10,"The ultimate suspense, crime mystery put into a thrilling story that feels authentic. Alfred Hitchcock does a fantastic job with directing and James Stewart is doing a fantastic performance that feels unbelievably real.The set looks extremely genuine!

Its also very easy to follow along the red thread in it.Definitely a must watch of this masterpiece classic!"
LarryCross45,"Dec 9, 2020",10/10,"Hitchcock had a lot of verifiable classics, but Rear Window may best them all. With Stewart and Kelly's performances, the tense atmosphere created by the clever staging, and the thrilling final stretch, this is one of the best movies of the classic Hollywood era."
ciar206,"May 7, 2020",10/10,This movie is all about Grace Kelly for me - classic. The camera loves her. Her outfits are purposeful and perfect. She moves with elegance. If you've seen the movie before - watch it again and she has perfect she is! Be well!
HuntinPeck80,"Aug 5, 2024",9/10,"One of the scintillating Jimmy Stewart / Alfred Hitchcock movies, probably the most frightening, although also pretty funny in the early phase of the movie.L. B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries. Makes me think of Stewart bellowing ""C. K. Dexter HAVEN!"" in The Philadelphia Story. Jeff is an intrepid photographer confined to his apartment in the stifling NY summer. The reason? A broken leg. Thankfully it's not too lonely, even if he has no TV. There are a whole host of rear windows to watch. A ballet dancer, some newlyweds, a travelling salesman with a nagging wife, another couple who prefer to sleep on the fire escape and let their little dog go up and down to the garden in a basket on a rope; a composer, a middle-aged spinster, a sculptor, and all their guests.Jeff has his own company. A visiting nurse, Stella (the eternally brillaint Thelma Ritter) and a remarkably beautiful girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), who glides in every evening and always exquisitely dressed. I'd love to know how they met. Both are looking forward to the day, a week hence, when the cast comes off his leg.Then, one night, a shriek. But where did it come from?Little by little Jeff, and then his ladies, become convinced a murder has taken place. Is it the summer heat overcooking their brains or are they onto something grisly? What right do they have to spy on Jeff's neighbours, in any case. (Imagine that question today, in our world of constant snooping, oversharing and surveillance.) Jeff's cop buddy, Doyle (Wendell Corey, always the square-jawed stiff) is sceptical to say the least. All evidence points to Jeff using this murder theory as an excuse to avoid talking any more about giving up his roving lifestyle and marrying Lisa.I'll tell you, the climax of this movie will have you sick with fear. In a good way, naturally. You know what I mean.Rear Window, like Hitchcock's Rope, only uses music as part of the environment, with scoring relegated to the credit titles. Like Rope it's all in one location, but played over several days instead of just one. But Rear Window is much more about the how than the reason why, although both feature Jimmy Stewart as a man, alert and intelligent, getting sick with suspicion that something terrible has happened. This movie is the more exciting of the two because there's a greater feeling of risk for the amateur detectives as the story moves forward and they take greater risks in pursuit of evidence.The only things that work against Rear Window are the fact that once you know you know, the typical problem with a crime caper, but also the hasty tying-off the story at the end. Vertigo also had a slightly iffy ending, and let's not forget that massive expositional dump that comes at the end of Psycho. So, I guess endings were Hitchcock's Achilles Heel. Nobody's perfect. But one thing's sure, the master of suspense sure ain't boring."
tindfoting,"Apr 10, 2023",9/10,"No music... except what you hear from the neighbours. No scene changing. And for Hitchcock, very little direction of the actors. ""Just do your thing"". Like looking in at the lives of neighbours. Hitchs favorite actor, Jimmy Stewart, in a wheelchair, so obssessed with looking at what might be a murderer, that he completely ignore Lisa (cinemas most gorgeous actress, Grace Kelly). It's actually been remade under different names at least 3 times (one with Christopher Reeve after his accident), so it's highly influental. And proves, like Rope (but better) that with the right man behind the camera, you CAN make a movie suspenseful with only one location. We are peeping toms alongside Stewart (I remember a quote from Ricky Gervais: ""If I walk past a house without curtains, I look inside. It's they're bloody fault), staring in on happy and sad lifes. And again Hitch steps out of the curve, making Grace Kelly the adventerous hero, and James Stewart... well, impotent, as Hitchcock himself said. He is a man of adventure, but cant do anything with a broken leg, other than spying. Btw, some of the dialogue is funny as hell, considered when it was filmed. The theories of how Raymond Burr disposed of his sick wife is insanly macabre. A masterclass in cramping down a movie to a small set."
AaronCapenBanner,"Oct 12, 2013",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock directed this classic suspense film that stars Jimmy Stewart as L.B. 'Jeff' Jeffries, a photographer laid up in his New York apartment in a wheelchair after breaking his leg getting an action shot at an auto race. He has taken to spying on his neighbors from his rear window with a pair of binoculars, when he becomes convinced that his neighbor Lars Thorwald(played menacingly by Raymond Burr) has murdered his wife. He tries to convince a police detective friend of his(played by Wendell Corey) but without proof, can do nothing. He then enlists his high society girlfriend(beautiful Grace Kelly) and his nurse(played by Thelma Ritter) to investigate, with unexpected and dangerous results...Brilliant film effectively blends witty humor and glamor with menace and murder. Incredibly suspenseful and compelling story, endearing characters, and superbly directed climax all make this a classic, not to be missed."
victordelavieter,"Aug 16, 2020",10/10,"What does a genius have to have for a compelling movie? A good story, good actors, good set dressing. Hitchcock builds up tension like nobody else, with James Stewart hardly moving in his wheelchair ans Grace Kelly cracking unforgettable lines, challenging and/or seducing the protagonist in every scene.
What colours. What rhythm. What music and sound syncing in. What eminently played out little scenes seen from Jeff's window.
It is the darker dimension that makes this film perfect. The audience is kept in suspense over many plotlines, carefully developed an masterly filmed. Seen in this way, the building opposite is the main attraction, with about five stories going on at the same time, some with very dark outcomes.
An all-time high in visual arts."
ssssgelojun,"Aug 25, 2020",9/10,"Unique shooting techniques, with the hero's eyes as the lens, to peer into the lives of the neighbors. The audience gradually sees a murder coming to the surface with the hero's eyes, but murder is not the whole of the movie, it is just a movie in this movie. In this film, every window is a screen, and every moment is a film of its own. Maybe that's what makes it special. It's attractive enough.Talk a little bit more about role setting.The hero is set as a photojournalist unable to move freely due to illness.
As a photojournalist, the man's instinctive curiosity and observation led him to focus on the smallest things, and the neighbors' parents catered to this habit, relieving the boredom and boredom caused by his absence from work. (And the metaphorical voyeur is not a normal person.)The film's unusual and bizarre act of ""prolonged peeping"" adds credibility to the character's presence and reduces the audience's sense of alienation."
nihalat-27063,"Nov 16, 2022",6/10,"So I decided to check out this movie after being told countless times how Hitchcock was the master of suspense and seeing that it had an 8.5 on IMDB, the highest for any Hitchcock movie.It started off well with some camerawork that I liked and a LOT of focus on the women, I found this use of the female actors as eye candy a bit out of touch with the tonality of the film.The film builds some suspense towards the end and I was curious as to what had happened, but I was thoroughly disappointed with the ending. It's not that the reveal wasn't any good, there was no reveal at all. The idea of building suspense without ending with some ""Aha!"" moment or at least something novel is just weird to me. It's possible the ending was novel at the time of it's release, I don't know about that.Overall it was a pretty disappointing viewing especially after all the high praise that made me form my expectations. This was despite my being willing to suspend my disbelief to how pretty much all of the major happenings take place within the protagonist's line of view, this NEVER happens in real life, even with the kind of apartment complex they were living in the blinds would be drawn(Maybe things were different back then).The leading pair were great. The acting was convincing(except for one character, the lady with dog, it may have been the writing). The movie seemed to be sped up at some wrong places, maybe some technical issue.I'll check out Vertigo and if that doesn't work either, maybe Hitchcock's not for me."

DocD456,"Mar 1, 2004",7/10,"Alfred Hitchcock's masterpiece `Rear Window,' was something a bit different for the time. Known as the master of suspense, Hitchcock, used camera angles, plot structure and an overall atmosphere to give a sense that you're in the movie. `Rear Window' was filmed on only one set and in one room making this movie truly unique. This movie stars James Stewart as L.B. `Jeff' Jeffries, Grace Kelly as Lisa Fremont, Wendell Corey as Lt. Thomas Doyle and Thelma Ritter as Stella. All of who give a wonderful performance and gibe the story life. Jeff, who is the main character in the movie, is a professional photographer who travels the world and is unfortunately stuck inside his apartment because of a broken leg hi had received. This film is viewed from his prospective as he views his neighborhood and his fellow neighbors. Hitchcock's choice of music was very interesting for this film because there is none, or at least no official sound track. All music that was used in the film was from his near by neighbors, or music playing on the street, which in turn was in sync with what was going on. This films battles a lot of controversy over ethics and morals as James Stewart `peeps' out his windows of his apartment, is it okay? Is it wrong? Although Hitchcock is known for his fantastic horror movies, this is a great mystery movie to watch. Hitchcock did a great job casting this film, James Stewart was a perfect choice, because many viewers at the time felt like they could identify with him. This film really gets you hooked and making you ask what exactly is next. I give it 8.5 out of 10 stars, for the spectacular work put into making the set of `Rear Window' and also the great job the performers and Hitchcock putting together this movie."
anikaish,"May 11, 2020",3/10,"There is just one plot in this whole movie. Boring, as nothing much was going on without same one thing. Would not suggest anyone of this generation."
DKosty123,"Sep 19, 2006",10/10,"Technically, this is the reverse of 1948's ROPE. ROPE's murder happens behind a closed curtain. This films observes everything through open windows & curtains. There was so little wasted footage in this because Hitch knew what he wanted to shoot before he shot it, that there was less than 10 minutes edited from the film as shot. The efficiency is almost as good as ROPE but the sequences are shorter.Jimmy Stewart plays a man with a broken leg in an apartment complex (so large a set that the crew came to think of the set as home during the shooting of this film) with nothing better to do than gawk out at all the neighbors while he is recovering. Grace Kelly in one of her last & best complex roles before becoming Princess Grace is Stewarts girlfriend (also presented as a bit of a tomboy as well as being a sensuous beauty) who winds up along with Stewart's maid getting involved in the mystery that a neighbor (played by Raymond Burr) presents because of how he is observed by Stewart.This is Alfred Hitchcock at his best, presenting situations in which the viewer gets emotionally involved & wants to help the folks on screen with their dilemma. From the short story is added other folks in the story from Miss Lonely Hearts, to others as Stewart, much more comfortable in this film than he was in ROPE, is on the mend from a broken leg peering in on the multiple apartments & people in this little world.It is a fine film because even though the action is all limited to one huge set (apartment & window to a multi-apartment complex) for the most part, it explores & surprises the viewer with what can happen in such a static situation. I am thankful the studio came out with a restored version as this is a film that is well worth restoring to it's original form. Thelma Ritter is exceptional in her role as Stewarts maid.The tension when the salesman (Burr) confronts Stewart in his apartment is brilliant & the technical use of now outdated flashbulb photography still plays well as setting the tension in this sequence."
janstue,"Feb 1, 2023",8/10,"This movie really is a banger. Today I've finally watched it after finding it available in English language. The atmosphere is great. I could feel myself being in the situation with the guy bound to his window. The old charm of the movie captures a lot that is impossible to do in more modern movies. I can't say what it is directly, for dissecting single elements always takes away from the whole. A concern I've heard quite often is that older movies like that are not up to todays standards in things technic etc., and therefore it wouldn't be scary or captivating anymore; I can only speak for myself but that wasn't the case for me at all. I was captivated. The movie doesn't rely on special effects or anything that could be much of a barrier for the modern viewer."
dhauff78,"Nov 22, 2021",10/10,"Rear Window is Hitchcock's best film and perhaps the greatest movie ever; at least it's my favorite. We are all voyeurs and can't help ourselves in ""looking out"" at the lives of others, particularly when we have moments of low in our own lives.This film has one of the best set designs in the history of film and is a must see for movie lovers."
jonnaharkenson,"Jul 23, 2021",10/10,"I'm not a movie buff so I'm not going to overanalyze the film, I'm just a casual viewer. I heard about this film from one of 'The Simpsons' episodes (the one where Bart broke his leg and spied on his neighbor from his bedroom window), so then I was curious about this movie. I watched the remastered version of this film in high definition and I'm blown away at how good this movie was. I haven't seen much classic films but I think this movie was ahead of its time, Alfred Hitchcock puts a lot of effort into his art and it really shows.The view from the window of the apartment out into the courtyard is absolutely beautiful, there's a clear view of everyone's apartments and what they're doing and you can even see people dining in the restaurant in the far distance of the background, I applaud for this much attention to detail. This film takes me back in time to New York City in the 1950's, it gave me a taste of what life might've looked like back in the day (especially watching the remastered version in color and high definition). The acting was surprisingly good and the storyline is good (though the ending was not what I expected, but it was still good). There is a little bit of romance and humor in this film, and lots of suspense. The Alfred Hitchcock knows about human behavior and how we love being curious and looking at other people's lives and seeing their happiness and pain.It felt like I was there in the movie, watching these people's lives through the window and bring curious, just like the main character, and wondered what will happen next. This movie made me an instant fan of Alfred Hitchcock's films and got me more interested in watching classic movies. I definitely recommend it and this is one of the best classic films of the 1950's, I recommend you watch the remastered version."

truemythmedia,"Jan 30, 2020",8/10,"Rear Window may not be my favorite Hitchcock film, but it's still a timely classic thriller with a lot of influential material that has been passed down for years and years, there's an obvious reason why he's hailed as the master of suspense, he knows his style and he owns it proudly, wearing it right on his sleeve. I would say this is one of the best films for a newcomer of Hitchcock, and it has pretty much everything that makes a Hitchcock film just that, it has beautiful style and revealing cinematography, making the camera its own character, fully fleshed out characters that are built slowly from the beginning, and of course plenty of intensity and suspense revolving around this brutal murder mystery. It's sharp script helps elevate some of the more dated, for the times sort of material, which there's a decent amount here. And while the ending didn't satisfy me, it still has plenty of closure and a pretty cool final confrontation between the killer and Jeff, all led by fine performances which makes Rear Window a treat to watch every time."
beziercurveguru,"Mar 12, 2024",10/10,"In my view, the most compelling aspect of the film is its setting. We find ourselves confined to the perspective of James Stewart's character, confined to a wheelchair with a broken foot, peering out his window. With minimal action, the suspense thrives on the interactions of just a few characters with the main character. Through his lens, we uncover the mystery without relying on exposition dialogue. Hitchcock masterfully plants seeds of deception while keeping the audience engaged.Moreover, Stewart's physical vulnerability adds another layer of tension, as we remain wary of a potential confrontation with the antagonist.I've often heard that Hitchcock crafted his films with the audience experience in mind, and ""Rear Window"" stands as a timeless classic due to the immersive position he places us in throughout the film."
ethlaid,"Apr 18, 2021",10/10,"A pure masterpiece from start to finish. Visually stunning, incredible performances and such a suspense, gripping captivating plot. Constantly adding more and more to the mix, interesting the viewer to mysterious levels. Sir Alfred Hitchcock at his best."

Or the ingenuity of director Alfred Hitchcock
In addition to the outstanding performance of the roles played by the heroes of the film.If you were able to shoot a copy of this movie on the ground, I will tell you this movie is a Hollywood grant to the world of cinema."
coltras35,"Dec 28, 2021",10/10,"Alfred Hitchcock has always had a penchant to focus on the mental psyche, or an obsession such as fear of heights, birds or kleptomania to name a few, and in Rear Window he puts voyeurism under the spotlight - people watching that becomes dangerous for people watcher, and in this riveting Hitchcock thriller James Stewart stars as the window watcher who witnesses murder.The story: Confined to a wheelchair following an accident, magazine photographer Jeff Jeffries passes the time by observing the behaviour of his neighbours. When an invalid wife he has been watching seemingly disappears, Jeff and his girlfriend Lisa decide to investigate - putting themselves in deadly danger.Also starring a menacing Raymond Burr as the killer and Grace Kelly as Stewart's girlfriend, Rear Window is a gem of a thriller that ratchets up the tension gradually and it reaches an unbearable fever pitch towards the end, especially when the killer realises he's being observed. Brilliant performances, superb camera work and great insight on neighbourhood and our obsession with observing people."
eyeluvhotboyz,"Mar 1, 2004",7/10,"`Rear Window' is a great movie, if the viewer is into more drawn out plots. If they are only into movies that catch their attention quickly, this is not the movie for them.This film had a very unique set.  The entire movie is filmed in an indoor set.  It also is filmed so that everything is inside the apartment of the main character.  Things happen outside, but all of the camera angles are simply looking out the window.When compared to most movies, `Rear Window' is very good.  The only time this movie does not `measure up' is when compared to `Psycho', Hitchcock's more notable movie.  The Master of Suspense didn't really live up to his name in this movie.  This is supposed to be a suspenseful movie, but comparatively, it is not suspenseful at all.  Though good camera angles, and good music selection, did help things along, it did not seem to have the Alfred Hitchcock touch.Overall, this reviewer gives this movie a seven out of ten.  It is good if you have the attention span for drawn out movies.  But if the viewer is looking for `entertain me, quick' they are looking at the wrong movie."
prasad-mapatuna,"Nov 23, 2009",5/10,"This movie being in IMDb top 20 puzzles me somewhat. I have seen most of the IMDb top 20 movies and they lived up to my expectations or exceeded expectations apart from perhaps The Dark Knight, Star Wars, and Lord of the ring. Those movies are up there understandably due the votes of the huge fan base. But how did Rear Window got up there? Due to the fan base of Hitchcock? Probably... and may be also due to the fact this is a pioneering movie of its genre. I can try and agree with reasons given by reviewers who has given very high rating for this movie. However, the whole package is bit disappointing, specially when you put this movie in current context. I cannot agree that this is a timeless classic. Anyway, you have to put my rating of 5 in context as well. I am rating it for the entertainment value forgetting about the fact that Hitchcock did this movie in 1954 and he was a pioneer of the genre."
mileskbridge,"Aug 16, 2021",10/10,"Brilliant film, I saw it a few months ago at my local cinema as they've been screening some Hitchcock films as part of a season. I need to see this again soon as it was fantastic, so gripping and tense in the perfect moments, with outstanding film-making by the one and only Alfred Hitchcock!"
brp-91602,"Sep 27, 2018",10/10,"It's great to experience a movie that leaves you on the edge of your seat, very rarely does a movie have a story that has you so immersed that you forget you are watching a movie. The movie was so good I had my roommates join me in the movie viewing. I enjoyed a lot of the subtle camera work in the movie because it made you feel like you are seeing everything though Jeff's perspective.
A good example is when Jeff is looking out his window to see his neighbor, Lars Thorwald, bringing his wife food to her bed on a tray, the camera is zoomed out, showing that Jeff is just passively watching not seeing anything interesting happening. Then it shows Jeff sitting in his wheelchair suddenly being enticed in something that's going on off camera, so the camera pans back to Lars and his wife but this time the camera is slowly zooming in as the scene progresses to show that Jeff is interested in what's going on, it's as if we are seeing this scene through Jeff's eyes.
Something that I found very interesting about rear window that I didn't realize until we talked about it in class, is the fact that the whole movie takes place in the same room for the whole length of the movie. That's very impressive since showing the same room for the whole movie would normally lose the audiences interest. The only other movies that I've seen pull this off was the breakfast club and 12 angry men.
I thought It was very cool that Jeff was watching all his neighbors as if it was some crystal ball showing him all the different futures that he could have. I liked that each neighbor represented something that Jeff was thinking about, whether it was the young couple who just got married and are happy that they just got married, showing that Jeff was thinking about how happy he would be if he was to marry Lisa. Miss. Torso representing some girl of his dreams that he just can't take look away from her. Lars Thorwald representing an older version of Jeff who is unhappy with his marriage. The young musician, representing Jeff because he's successful and well recognized but unhappy because he feels alone. Miss. Lonely heart representing an older version of Jeff who choose not to marry Lisa and feeling alone.
I loved the fact that you can see Hitchcock in the movie when the musician is at the piano and someone is winding the mantel clock, I like it because I thought Orson Welles was one of the first movie directors to cameo in their own movies.
Something I thought was interesting was the fact that at the end of the movie it shows the young couple's window, the newly wed husband comes out to smoke and have a small break from his new wife and she calls out to him and it shows his face that he's annoyed representing that the honey moon was over."
richardchatten,"Jun 20, 2024",10/10,"If ever a film was asking for a presentation on the IMAX this would be the film.With good reason Jimmy Stewart claimed 'Rear Window' was his personal favourite of the four films he made with Hitchcock and it remains The Master's definitive analysis of voyeurism.Hitchcock's embrace of colour is seldom remarked upon, but it helped him accomplish effects that would have quite impossible in black & white (such as the tip of Thorwold's cigarette glowing in his darkened apartment and red flashes to simulate dazzle).It was probably also the most accomplished example of Hitchcock's long held desire to generate suspense in a confined space, the main set never looking like anything but a set. But charmingly so."
lovebugsbe90,"Aug 24, 2021",9/10,Hitch had the talent of watching and engaging viewers. James Stewart had the remarkable talent of drawing in an viewer and keeping their attention.Fold in Grace Kelly's beauty and you have the timeless classic. It could happen?? You be the judge!
mardalsfossen01,"Jun 14, 2019",8/10,Revisiting the setting always feels nice. This is a well chosen place and a well chosen idea. Man in a wheelchair + binoculars + neighbors + voyeurism + a case to be solved.James Stewart and Grace Kelly show a really good performance which makes this movie's plot a joy to follow even if it feels a bit too staged at times. Also in my opinion could have needed more plot twists which really knock you off your chair. 'Rear Window' does also have thrilling parts though making you hold your breath.
TheBlessed987,"Mar 22, 2007",7/10,"Rear window is one of the best movies ever made. Jeffries a photographer that broke his leg starts looking out of his window to pass the time, after a while he starts to notice some odd happenings throughout one of his neighbors that lead him to the conclusion of murder. The suspense keeps you on the edge of your seat to the very end constantly wondering what happens next. This is by far one of director Alfred Hitchcocks greatest work and helps justify the saying that he is the master of suspense. The acting is perfect and character creation is flawless. One flaw might be that people nowadays might not enjoy it as much because the film is not as fast paced as the movies today. although it may not stand up to the hype of films now it has a perfect story which the movies nowadays cannot seem to create. I greatly suggest watching rear window it deserves more than it ever got."
HotToastyRag,"Oct 6, 2020",3/10,"I know it's an extremely famous movie, but Rear Window completely personifies why I don't like Alfred Hitchcock movies. It's so slow!James Stewart, in his handsome silver fox stage, is confined to his wheelchair for the duration of the movie. He's a go-getter photographer who broke his leg during a daring stunt, and he's bored out of his skull doing nothing but stare out the window at the neighbors in the apartment building across the way. Then again, how bored can he be? He can read, watch television, write, work on a photography portfolio, fool around with his girlfriend Grace Kelly, and exchange barbs with his caretaker Thelma Ritter. Still, he's bored. Then one day, he witnesses a murder. . .I love James Stewart, but his sparkly blue eyes and flattering silver hair isn't enough to save the movie. Grace Kelly isn't given anything to do but give Jimmy suggestively naughty looks (that he's more than happy to return), but she looks beautiful. They had an amusing non-affair during the filming. Mrs. Stewart famously accompanied her husband to the set every day, just in case; and Grace declared Jimmy one of the most attractive men she'd ever met (probably because she couldn't have him!). If you think you'll like it, go ahead and rent the classic. Just be prepared that it's extremely slow."
Quirk47,"Aug 29, 2020",8/10,Alfred Hitchcock is absolute genius. Though the murder was nver shown or seen by anybody in the film it's solved at the end. How can a director comeup with this kind of idea. Initial sequences are low..but later on its engaging. Story idea was a gem. All the crafts are perfectly shown. Must watch
InlyCii,"May 1, 2020",8/10,We often see people with a tendency to peep in Hitchcock movies or use peeping lens angles to reflect the world. The rear window can be said to be a classic work that maximizes the habit of Hitchcock.
gab-14712,"Sep 24, 2018",9/10,"Alfred Hitchcock is one of cinema's most important auteurs and every motion picture release with his name attached was a big event. The sharp-detailed director had two movies released in 1954. The first was the thrilling, perhaps a bit minor Dial M for Murder. His second film is the subject of this review, Rear Window. Rear Window is one of Hitchcock's best, if not the best thrillers he has ever made. The story is simple enough, but the film envelopes you in a world of nonstop tension. I was biting my nails from start to finish, and that is habit that rarely comes out. Good job, Mr. Hitchcock!The story, written by John Michael Hayes seems quite simple, but I love the complexity that is given to the film. Just like Hitchcock's other 1954 feature, most of the film takes place in one location-the apartment of James Stewart's character, L.B Jeffries. The one set based off Greenwich Village in New York City, that Hitchcock built on the set of Paramount studios is very elaborate and it really works well with the film. Did you know that he even created a drainage system that would allow the water used as rain to drain? One thing that Hitchcock excels at in each film of his is his excellent sense of detail.L.B Jeffries aka Jeff (James Stewart) is confined to his apartment after his breaking his leg. He has two women coming to his apartment to take care him: his wisecracking nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter) and his beautiful longtime girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly) who works as a fashion model. To save him from boredom, Jeff decides to spy on his neighbors with his binocular. There is Miss Lonely Hearts who cooks fancy dinners for imaginary guests and there is Miss Torso who entertains various males just to name some of the people he sees. One rainy night, he notices a neighbor named Thorwald (Raymond Burr) leaving a with a trunk three times and that his nagging and invalid wife is no longer present. That leaves Jeff suspicious of his neighbor and he believes a murder took place. Along with Stella, Lisa, and his police lieutenant friend Tom Doyle (Wendell Corey), Jeff begins to put the pieces together to find the truth.When there is only location, you need great direction and great acting to make up for that closed location. We already know Hitchcock directed the hell out of the film, and he earned an Academy Award nomination. What about the acting? I can happily report that the acting is phenomenal. James Stewart really crushes it here, considering his character is immobilized the entire time. Pre-war, Jimmy Stewart was known for his comedies, westerns, and taking nice guy roles in general. After WW2 ended, he began taking more complex and darker roles. Hitchcock exploited that side of him not only with this film, but in 1958's Vertigo as well. He does well with the coldness of his character. Grace Kelly, who appeared in Dial M for Murder, does well here. She is cool and elegant and is more than just the beautiful blonde. She also does some unexpecting stuff such as sneaking in the apartment of the suspect-and that scene is dripping with tension, I promise!There is a lot that goes behind Hitchcock's head. One idea he prominently displays here is the idea of voyeurism. The basic definition of voyeurism is taking pleasure in watching someone unobserved. The term can be used in a sexual way, or it could be used in a way that watching someone else's pain relieves the watcher of his/her pain. Also, what about us viewers of the movie? Are we not taking pleasure or interest in watching the pain or emotions of these characters? Voyeurism is the central theme at play here. There are also themes that can be discussed regarding impotence of male figures and how women are just not supposed to be seen as beautiful, but how they can be regarded as puzzles or even threats. For such a simple story, there can be much to think about!Rear Window is a Hitchcock masterpiece. It really thrills you from start to finish and I am not talking about any of those cheap thrills. The characters are built up so well that by the time we get to the payoff in the end, do we really care about that payoff? I mean that in a positive way! With only one set location, the use of diegetic (natural) sound outside the main titles, this really is a thriller to behold. I can't be sure if this is my favorite Hitchcock film as there are so many masterpieces, but this is up there!My Grade: A"
AshleyO-699,"Nov 13, 2025",10/10,"Just to let you know, I'm 36, so when I talk movies with anyone, friends or strangers and I describe what the greatest thriller of all time is, and I mention Rear Window, I often get blank stairs because for the most part, my generation have never even heard of this movie. If I mention Alfred Hitchcock, they all know Pyscho, but none of them know this masterpiece.Feel free to disagree, but I still feel this is the greatest work of art Hitchcock created, and I enjoyed Pyscho for the most part, but I do believe it's legacy is more impressive than the actual movie. Rear Window, felt more complete. And it's a genre that has a lot more misses than hits, because Thrillers, even the good ones find it hard to grip you through the whole movie, and they end up using tired cliches or non plausible plot twists to keep you hooked. Rear Window is the rare Thriller that grabs you at the opening and only lets go when the credits role. It's impeccably and intelligently crafted.Gripping characters and a brilliant written screenplay and direction, I honestly haven't got any faults, I loved it, and I rarely give full 10/10 for anything. But this is a near two hour picture that had me mesmerized through the whole run time. Honestly my reviews are often long and drawn out, because I find faults. I find it harder to write when I'm praising something.So all I can add is that, while it may be slightly forgotten about when we talk about classic movies, if you are a fan of mysteries or thrillers, this is one of the best that ever did it."
lagudafuad,"Oct 29, 2012",6/10,"Always close your windows and drains; there could be a peeping tom about.Rear window coins the phrase, ""an idle hand is the devils workshop"", as our character ""Jeff"" Jeffries played by James Stewart, who spent most of his days peeping into the houses of his neighbors, due to a broken leg that has him confined to a wheel chair.Rear window was directed by Alfred Hitchcock and is based on Cornell Woolrich's 1942 short story ""It Had to Be Murder"".The movie stars James Stewart and the beautiful Princess Grace Kelly. It was nominated for four Academy Awards and has remained in the top 50 of AFI's 100 Years100 Movies list and on their 10th-anniversary edition.This movie is my third best James Stewart movie so far (I hope to see more) after It's A Wonderful Life (1946) and Mr Smith Goes To Washington (1939).The movie is considered to be one of Hitchcock's finest films. On the website Rotten Tomatoes it has an approval rating of a 100%, so definitely it is a movie to watch.The movie plot is about a Professional photographer L.B. ""Jeff"" Jeffries who breaks his leg while getting an action shot at an auto race.Now he is on a wheel chair with a cast on his leg and he can't leave his New York apartment. To pass time he peeps out his rear window observing the neighbors, memorising their patterns and trying not to miss a thing happening in their lives.Things starts getting thrilling when he begins to suspect that a man across the courtyard may have murdered his wife.There are movies whose themes can be said to have been based on Rear Window like Michael Davis's Eight Days a Week in 1999, Robert Zemeckis's What Lies Beneath in 2000 and Disturbia in 2007 which kinda reminds you of Rear Window itself except the protagonist (Shia LaBeouf) is under house arrest instead of on a wheel chair with a broken leg, and his neighbor is a serial killer other than having committed a single murder.Many TV shows too have used this Rear Window idea like The Simpsons, White Collar and more. But the TV movie that was done 1998 which was a remake of the 1954 classic is my best, I actually saw the TV movie first before seeing the original it stared Christopher Reeve, who himself was paralyzed as the result of a 1995 horse-riding accident, so he fitted the role perfectly.Well enough has been said about Rear Window, it is a classic Alfred Hitchcock thriller that I can say if you are watching all Alfred Hitchcock classic then you must see this one.www.lagsreviews.com"

Blondi85,"Mar 1, 2004",N/A,"Rear Window is another genius film made by Alfred Hitchcock.  The depth and directing of this movie is amazing. There is no other movie like it and maybe never will be.Rear Window is about a wheelchair bound man named L.B. Jeff Jeffries who is stuck in his apartment due to a broken leg and ends up spying on his neighbors through his apartment window. He notices something fishy while watching his neighbor and the story becomes suspenseful.Though the movie starts out slow, which is the only negative thing to mention, it definitely becomes more exciting as the movie goes on. The whole film takes place in one area, L.B. Jeff Jeffries's apartment and the view he has of the outside and of his neighbors apartments through their windows. It was a huge risk making this film using only that area for all of the scenes. Alfred Hitchcock is most likely the only director who could pull off making a film like this.  The camera angles and the symbolism of each of the apartment floors representing something different is inventive.  Each of his skills keep the movie interesting.The acting was well-done, but it wasn't what made the movie. Jimmy Stewart who played L.B. Jeff Jefferies did well portraying his character like in most of the movies he is in. The glamorous Grace Kelly who played Lisa Fremont (Jeff Jefferies girlfriend) did a great job playing a sophisticated character.  Though the acting wasn't amazing, Jimmy Stewart and Grace Kelly's chemistry on screen was enjoyable.Although this movie wasn't as frightening as Hitchcock's other film Psycho, it is more creative. The depth and the cinematography of this film is remarkable and once again makes Alfred Hitchcock a genius.This movie deserves 9.5 out of 10 stars."
Hos9988,"Jan 24, 2005",6/10,"I know everyone is going to say I have no taste in cinema or whatever but I think this movie is kinda overrated. It was probably really good back when it came out, but I think it's a little dated now. I agree that it is well made and directed, and I liked the whole concept of seeing through the eyes of the protagonist, and how all of the neighbors had their own little story, but the movie just moved too slow. There was not enough suspense or surprise that it should be considered it a masterpiece thriller. Maybe this movie is just so highly rated because it was one of the firsts of its kind, but I can think of many movies I enjoyed more than this. I thought the plot was interesting but not brilliant as many people express. Anyway, I give it a 5/5 for direction and cinematography, but 3/5 for plot."

Moviefreecaps,"Sep 27, 2022",10/10,"""We've become a race of Peeping Toms. What people ought to do is get outside their house and look in for a change.""Alfred Hitchcock directs the suspenseful, mysterious crime thriller known as Rear Window. As one of his greatest works this film is classic and inventive to the world of cinema. The acting throughout is fantastic. The audience sees perfection from every character throughout the film. When talking about atmospheric cinema this is a picture that cannot be overlooked. Hitchcock successfully sinks the audience into this city neighborhood. The themes that are presented throughout this film make the audience look internally as the initial quote suggests. This is a critique of human society and our nosiness which has aged to perfection. Instead of looking at our own lives we use others as distractions. This is a story about a news photographer who has suffered an injury and is confined to his apartment for months. During this time his only entertainment is looking into the homes of people who live in his neighborhood. One day he suspects a murder has happened and tries to solve this case. This a beautiful and timeless piece of cinema brought to us by one of the greatest directors of all time, Alfred Hitchcock."
snoozejonc,"Jul 6, 2025",10/10,"Rear Window deserves its classic status due to its intriguing story, strong central performance, and iconic visual storytelling.A film about a bored photographer, with a broken leg, spying on his neighbours should never work, but Hitchcock made it so, thanks to some great filmmaking techniques. I think it perfectly mixes the character interactions with the events unfolding from Jeff's point of view.I love that we know about the lives of the residents from the brief glimpses shown. This connects superbly to Jeff's psychological hang-ups in his relationship with Lisa. Plus, the central mystery is absorbing to watch unfold. It is hard not to become as voyeuristic as he, given how dramatic and amusing certain events are from his perspective.The set design, lighting, and costumes are full of beautiful art direction. The shot with the wedding ring is inspired. It is hard to take your eyes off Grace Kelly as the filmmakers maximise her screen presence at every moment. She is perfectly suited to the role and gives what feels like an effortless performance.Other stars like James Stewart, Wendall Corey, Raymond Burr, and Thelma Ritter are all superb. Stewart leads it brilliantly with his usual charisma and natural ability. Corey compliments him perfectly in their dialogue exchanges. I love the knowing glances between them, captured so well by the filmmakers. You know exactly what they are thinking."
emmakenny-39680,"Dec 11, 2018",9/10,"Rear Window is a great example of Hitchcock's mastery of cinematography. This movie follows the story of Jefferies, an adventure seeking photographer that is stuck in his small apartment due to a leg injury he received while on the job. He resorts to finding entertainment by watching his neighbors through his rear window. When he notices some suspicious behavior from one of the occupants across the way his boring recovery becomes a lot more interesting. Through solving this mystery Jefferies learns a lot about himself, his relationships with others, and how people interact with each other.
This movie is a great example of using lights and shadows to create suspense. By having the entire movie filmed from one vantage point, Jeffeirie's apartment, the light was pretty restricted. However, Hitchcock creates amazing effects with minimal light. By using the window blinds to highlight certain parts of the room Hitchcock is able to make certain moments in the film more intense for the viewers. One of the most effective ways lighting was used to create suspense was by only having the eyes of the actors in the light. This made the characters more mysterious and invoked a sense of fear into the viewers.
Overall this was a fantastic film that incorporated the elements of cinematography extremely well and had a entertaining and captivating story line."
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Dec 20, 2018",9/10,My Rating : 9/10'Rear Window' is captivating and spellbinding. One of the best works of Hitchcock. It will never let you down.A supremely entertaining thriller. Must watch!
RatedVforVinny,"Apr 30, 2020",9/10,"Both a suspenseful thriller and brilliant murder mystery, to which nothing before or since is quite comparable. All the action takes place from just one room, either in the stated cramp't apartment, or for most of the time spying on the neighbours through the main protagonist's rear window. One of Hitchcock's regarded classics, which has certainly stood the test of time, and in every aspect of quality film making. The ending was a tad predictable but there are enough 'Red Herrings' thrown into the plot to pretty much keep you intrigued to the very final frame. Creepy and truly atmospheric to boot."
Bernie4444,"Jan 17, 2024",10/10,"It is a hot evening in an attendance apartment complex. There is no air-conditioning or self-consciousness that open windows attract voyeurs. L. B.

So, for entertainment, he gets out his high-powered binoculars to see with the neighbors across the courtyard that conveniently leaves their blinds open are up to. Naturally, he must make up scenarios as to what it is he thinks he is seeing.The shocker is he believes he spotted a neighbor Lars Thorwald (Raymond Burr) dispatching and disposing of his spouse. He adamantly tells his girlfriend and eventually the authorities. Naturally, there is no forthcoming evidence despite the incessant snooping of his girlfriend Lisa Carol Fremont (Grace Kelly.)Could be he was wrong in his assumption. Or will Lars get Jeff and the little dog too?This is a typical Alfred Hitchcock movie. That this is typical, is not to say that it is not great, and lots of fun to watch. We see more than our share of great actors including the Princess of Monaco when she was just Grace Kelly and Raymond Burr in one of his few dark character personas."
psionicpoet,"Apr 30, 2004",N/A,"""Rear Window"" is, as ""Rope"" was, a study of setting a story in a confined place. ""Rope is notable for the smallness of its set; one studio apartment, rarely leaving the main living, and edited in such a way as to appear as one continuous take. ""Rear Window"" is famous for just the opposite; it had a giant set, occupying he biggest studio on the lot, with and extra level excavated to provide a life-sized, four-story set. Hitchcock also uses many more cuts, using the shot-reaction-shot technique with L.B. Jeffries (Jimmy Stewart) as he uses cameras and binoculars to observe the goings on outside the rear widow of his apartment.The main theme of ""Rear Window is privacy  how far those standards extend, and what people do when they think they are secure in the privacy of their own home. Jeffries, a magazine photographer trapped in his apartment with a broken leg, turns to the view out his window to while away the hours until his cast comes off. His only contact with the outside world arrives in the form of his nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter), and female friend Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), a rich socialite who has a romantic interest in Jeffries (who seems to abandon his photographer skills as an observer when it comes to her).Hitchcock played with audiences by having them play the role of voyeur along with Jeffries  he knew that human nature compels us to keep staring, even when polite society tells us to look away and mind our own business. By capturing our interest with a variety of characters and a portion of their lives  Miss Lonelyhearts, Miss Torso, etc.  Hitchcock creates an interesting character study as well as his usual thriller. We are only allowed to see what Jeffries sees, bits and pieces presented out of context, and we are left to make our own theories about what these bits mean in the overall lives of these characters.The main focus of the movie is Jeffries suspicion of Lars Thorwald, who occupies a second-story apartment across from Jeffries'. He notices Thorwald's strained relationship with his wife, then her sudden disappearance. A number of events that could be related follows. As he pries more and more into Thorvald's life, he gets closer and closer to the man himself; climaxing in Lisa's entry into Thorwald's home to search for clues, and the mano-a-mano confrontation between the Jeffries and Thorwald at the film's end.By the movie's end, resolution has been achieved for most of the characters in the film; the truth about Thorwald is discovered, Miss Torso's husband arrives back from war, the couple that sleeps outside is training a new puppy, Miss Lonelyhearts and the musician with the studio apartment have linked up romantically. Even pessimistic Jeffries, bound yet again in his apartment with two broken legs, has found resolution, finally accepting Lisa as an equal. As the movie ends, the shutters on the window are drawn  he doesn't need them anymore."

So many movies from this era that put it to shame."
MrskiViletic,"Jan 6, 2019",10/10,"The classic from Hitchcock remembered for top notch acting, great visuals and set designs, a great script which has its fun and witty moments. The camera work on this movie may be one of the best from Hitchcock's filmography which has found its way in pop culture and cemented his legacy as one of the best directors of all times."
lavaside-60237,"Aug 16, 2023",6/10,"I think Hitchcock is one of those that people like because 'everyone else thinks he's great'.A bunch of his films went on sale on Prime for $4.99 - and so I decided to give the ones I haven't seen a chance.This was one of them.I have no clue what the 8.5 stars are for.James Stewart and Grace Kelly have zero chemistry - and are as 'believable as a couple' as a peanut butter and black pepper sandwich.In true Hitchcock fashion - the real movie doesn't start until half way through.Yes, this one is better than some I couldn't stand. IE: 'North by Northwest'.But it isn't an '8.5'. Lol. It isn't even a 7.I've been going back in film for a few years now, and I've grown a great appreciation for many of the old timers in acting. But I have to say, I have grown less a fan of Stewart as I go. He must have just been in the right place, at the right time. Same with Hitchcock."
lucastews,"Feb 29, 2020",1/10,"Absolute rubbish. Con job of the highest order. One of the most ridiculous, idiotic and pointless endings in history of movies. Everything and every moment invested in watching this hack came to a dead splat. I just wish Jim and Alfred had done us the favor of starting the movie I reverse order; that way, I would not have the rug pulled out from under me after two hours of trying to figure out such a hackneyed plot. Sorry, in this review of Rearview, I'm in the 1% and I'm happy to stay there."
tcchelsey,"Jun 12, 2024",10/10,"If only they had tie winners for Oscars, Alfred Hitchcock would have won (and most certainly deserved to win) the award for Best Director. Even critics have argued this was his best film of the decade, and that's saying a lot considering all his other masterpieces. Alas, Hitch lost the award to George Seaton (THE COUNTRY GIRL).Some of the best screenplays are simple stories. This is a prime example. Newspaper photographer James Stewart breaks his leg, passes the time sitting home watching his neighbors -- and witnesses a murder.Amazing. The difference is Hitch takes it to the next level and has some fun with it, in a dark comedy way naturally. Stewart is perfectly cast as our hero, attempting to solve the case himself, nearly getting himself killed. Grace Kelly compliments him as his wary girlfriend, and toss in Thelma Ritter as Stewart's philosphical nurse. Ritter is a hoot, with the best lines, and could have doubled as Stewart's mother!Warning; beware of tall, dark and deadly Raymond Burr, just a few years before fame as PERRY MASON, which would completely take him away from villainous roles for the rest of his career.Production notes indicate this was largely filmed at one of Paramount's biggest sound stages, thus the setting for the famous courtyard sequence, and an intricate drainage system added to handle the pouring rain. The behind the scenes crew deserved special credit for creating a masterpiece setting, even by today's standards.Based on a story by suspense writer Cornell Woolrich, who created the WHISTLER mystery series, also known for THE WINDOW (1949). Franz Waxman did the music score. Edgar Allan Poe Award for Best Screenplay. Oscar nominations also for Best Screenplay and Best Sound. Long running, and worth every second at 112 minutes.Hitch followed this with TO CATCH A THIEF, also starring Grace Kelly, where she met her future husband, Prince Ranier.Always on dvd and remastered blu ray for generations to come. Many thanks to TCM for running this movie great since the beginning."
ethanbresnett,"Jun 28, 2020",8/10,"Rear Window plays out like a piece of theatre. The staging of the film was magnificent. From the start Rear Window will draw you in, with the opening shot so rich in detail and promising so much for the rest of the film. Unsurprisingly Rear Window delivers on this promise. The plot was really intriguing, holding a true sense of mystery and suspense which will have you on tenterhooks. The character list is limited, with only really four genuine speaking parts in the film, the main two of course being James Stewart and Grace Kelly. The relationship between them was fun and had a good element of depth to it. It was nicely explored and felt real enough.The direction from Hitchcock was sublime. Rear Window would appear to be a tricky film to execute, taking place solely within one, confined room, albeit with constant glimpses of the (yet again confined) outside world. Despite this the film never feels claustrophobic or bland, maintaining a strong element of intrigue and freshness, which is a testament to Hitchcock's brilliance. The way that Hitchcock explored the various windows and lives of Stewart's neighbours so seamlessly and effectively was marvellous, injecting lots of humour into the piece.By god though, the final encounter was let down by some laughable effects. Obviously this film is nearly 70 years old so I shouldn't judge these effects too harshly, however the entire final scene, which should have been one of suspense, effectively became one of comedy. A real shame, but that comes with the territory of watching a film from the 50s I suppose.Rear Window is a great experience and a fantastic piece of cinema. The plot is sufficiently mysterious and engaging, the characters believable and enjoyable, and the direction spot on. A true classic."
zlx_zjlq,"Mar 28, 2020",8/10,"The use of the lens in a limited space is amazing. Because it is ""peeping,"" most of them are subjective lenses with the meaning of inspection and observation, but the arrangement of human eyes, telescopes, cameras and other media is not visually tedious at all."
marmar-69780,"Nov 16, 2019",10/10,"Rear window is hitchcock masterpiece of suspense thriller-horror even if way of directing ending is little weird to watch, for some it will be even funny but for me the rest of film from beginning to end is showcase of talent in every aspect"
beaudare-70996,"May 23, 2020",10/10,"As an American actor/ screenwriter, I think ""Rear Window"" not only shows Hitchcock's genius as a director, but also his eye for casting the lovely and enormously talented Grace Kelly, and allowing her to blossom as an actress. The best moment in the film is when James Stewart, ignoring Kelly while she kisses him, as he talks about the people across the way, asks her what she thinks. She then knowingly replies, ""Something too frightful to utter""... This film has everything modern films lack: style, suspense, humour, imagination, sublety, romance and a leading lady who is extremely sexy, but never trys to be.. Modern filmmakers could learn a lesson from Hitch...

Andy_MJD,"Feb 4, 2020",9/10,Interesting movie with Grace Kelly and James Stewart. Love the fact that we always see everything from the apartment. It really feels like we're trapped with the character in his wheelchair.
ben_yocom,"Feb 27, 2004",N/A,In an attempt not to ruin this movie for anyone reading this review I will refrain from discussing plot elements and I will focus more on the genius in the way it is filmed and the music that is used in the movie.This movie was filmed entirely in one set that was built indoors this is part of the genius of this movie. The entire movie is filmed from the point of view of one mans apartment and in the entire movie the view only leaves the apparent once. The view of this mans window over looks a courtyard that is in the middle of four other apartment buildings. Each building has several windows facing the courtyard and the viewer through this window learns much of the occupants. Each of these occupants seemingly represents an aspect of the human condition.Also apart of this movies greatness is the casting. The main character is cast very well and is very convincing. In the movie the viewer finds them self feeling as if they are the main character and becomes extremely connected to him. Also very well cast is the girl friend of the main character. The viewer gets very distinct impressions of her that change as the movie continues.The sound in this movie is very unique because there is very little music and sounds that are out of place. Though this movie is considered to be a classic Hitchcock film the lack of unexplained music makes it stick out from his other movies such as Psycho which is full of it.
Sees_Beneath_The_Surface,"May 14, 2025",7/10,"I've seen this movie a number of times and something about this time was too much.Perhaps it's because of efforts to drag our society back to a time when women were objects, to weak to be anyone other a pretty or sexy thing.Stewart plays Jeffries well, but the character is emblematic of so many things that were wrong with that period and trying to creep back.Telling ""Lisa"" she's overreacting, and to shut up! Actually used those words with no more thought than saying hello when picking up the phone.All in all, this is one of Hitchcock's better movies. The only one I like more is North by Northwest.But, I stand by my rating because the treatment of women is abhorrent."
Real_Review,"Jul 12, 2019",7/10,"There are over 700 reviews posted on IMDB for this 65 year old film. Here is something none of the other reviews will tell you...If you are a real film nerd, watch this one on mute with something else playing in the background. Throughout the film, you will see creatively framed and lit shots and scenes that are totally original. Hitchcock was in love with Grace Kelly, and when watching without sound, his obsession with her is more apparent. Not every film offers a worthy experience when muted, but 'Rear Window' (1954) is so well-shot that the story and dialogue can distract from Hitchcock's pure genius when holding a camera.RealReview Posting Scoring Criteria:

Ken-208,"May 18, 2000",5/10,This movie seemed OK but I was expecting a much better movie from the reviews in the IMDB.  The movie moved real slow..kinda long and drawn out...little suspence.  I thought it was rather boring.  I'd give this a 5 out of 10.  Mainly the story seemed lacking and not much of a plot.
Farzad-Doosti,"Nov 28, 2021",9/10,"A masterpiece by Hitchcock, filming and showing the story inside each window from the lens of this film captivates one, arousing curiosity for all viewers, not just Jeff!"
namse,"Nov 15, 2018",9/10,"The Rear Windows showed the best type of lighting skills at that period of time when movie tools and techniques were not at the best. The whole movie kept audiences' attentions and tensions in them before the climax of the film. Alfred Hitchcock knew how to keep the movie so concentrated throughout the movie and the keylightings mixing lowkey light and highkey lights gave the highlight effects that helped mainly to make the mood or the atmosphere of the movie suspenseful. By putting really bright light on the face of the main character, it's triggering the audiences to look at his emotions and what he's thinking of the whole situation in the film. It was interesting that when, the main character, got into the shadow of his room, it made it seem like that he's no longer being seen by the neighbors outside through his window. The way the highkey lightings worked with the neighbor's building showed precisely what the neighbors do and how their lives are like. The angles of the camera also was interesting in a way when it shows the aspects of the neighbors lives, it uses the perspective shots as if the scene is seen with the character's eyes. This film shows really good side of the use of lights in the movies and demonstrate that only with the light, you could make the movie out of it."
