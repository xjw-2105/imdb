andrewburgereviews,"Apr 1, 2019",10/10,"It is now past 1 PM and I just finished watching Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"". I should probably go to bed. It's late and tomorrow I have to wake up a bit early. But not early enough to postpone writing these lines. Now that I have seen it three times, the opportunity of sharing my thoughts and refreshed insights are too much of a good offer to sit on. So, bear with me.This film works so well because it takes place in an underworld in which we are so embedded that we do not even observe it. Coppola puts us straight in the smack-dab center of what is, admittedly, a society made by criminals for criminals. It is also the reason why it's so welcoming. We are surrounded by its inhabitants--cold-blooded murderers, men who see crime like a 9 to 5 job masquerading as honorable men. And I do mean men. From the outside, we would only witness the horrifying, disturbing manifestations of their well-thought out actions.But it goes even deeper than that. It all revolves around the Corleone family led by Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando). He is the most honest of these men, sitting right on the edge. But for people like him, who do not fully embrace this world, it's not easy. He avoids conflict until it is absolutely necessary. He is a man defined by moral principles. There is a scene at the beginning, in which, during his daughter's wedding day, one of his associates, Luca Brasi (Lenny Montana) practices his speech that he is going to give to the Don when he meets him. The scene with these two is funny and almost adorable. I could not help but sympathize both of them only to realize that I am feeling warmth for two mobsters. Not to even mention that Lenny Montana was an actual mob hit-man and that he was actually nervous as he said that line.The more I watched the more I realized just how incredibly complex and ruthless this society is and how it has the power to corrupt anyone to come in contact with it. The best example is Corleone's youngest son, Michael (Al Pacino). He returns home for his sister's wedding as a war hero dressed the part with his long-time girlfriend, Kay Adams (Diane Keaton). At first, he avoids this underworld, but necessity, first-hand exposure and just its sheer devilish appealing nature draws him in. As we get further in the film, the change is shocking and every outsider who ever got close to him is tainted in one way or another. If they survive it, they are drawn in as well as we are as viewers.Inside, Coppola exposes the family to us fully, with a bold personal approach and we witness every discussion, every methodically calculated choice. Crime is done simply because it is the nature of their business, and we are put on a chair alongside them, so we easily relate. For us, they are the good guys, the rival families are the bad guys. This is the greatest feat this film managed to pull off--set apart good guys and bad guys in a world filled with bad guys.This is a film of unmatched subtlety. No other movie sustains itself as good. No other film is done with such precision, attention and completeness. There are many layers which I probably missed and maybe will never notice. But I felt them. What director Francis Ford Coppola and his partner in crime (poor choice of words, sorry) Mario Puzo did is nothing short of a timeless piece of reference cinema whose influence is not based on reinventing the wheel, but rather perfecting it to the absolute maximum.Most masterpieces are remembered for their historical contributions. ""Citizen Kane"" brought the biggest step-up to the art form, the same things did ""Gone With the Wind"" or ""2001: A Space Odyssey"". ""The Godfather"" is one of the few films that will be remembered simply because they are that good and I cannot possibly imagine a greater achievement."
gogoschka-1,"Feb 11, 2018",10/10,"This isn't just a beautifully crafted gangster film. Or an outstanding family portrait, for that matter. An amazing period piece. A character study. A lesson in filmmaking and an inspiration to generations of actors, directors, screenwriters and producers. For me, this is more: this is the definitive film. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Feb 6, 2021",10/10,"A masterclass in film making, is The Godfather a contender for the best film of all time? I'd argue the case that it is, this is the ultimate gangster movie.Before you panic at the thought of a film being almost three hours long, you needn't, you won't even notice the time, it flies by.Production values are incredible, it looks sublime the whole way through, it's so well produced, at roughly fifty years old it puts many new films to shame.Brandon, Pacino and Castellano, just a few of the Incredible performances, I could add a whole lot more.If you're considering buying a hard copy, I would recommend it on blu ray, it is sharper than the dvd, there is a difference.This film has had a huge influence down the years, it is still, and will forever be, one of the greatest, 10/10."
danielfeerst,"Jan 22, 2020",10/10,"The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get."
0U,"Feb 23, 2020",10/10,"One of the best films of all time, an absolute masterpiece. The Godfather is arguably the best gangster drama as well as setting the standard for cinema."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jul 18, 2010",10/10,"There is very little that I can add to the reviews on here, that have explained what is so wonderful about The Godfather so well. I have seen many amazing movies, as well as some clunkers, but The Godfather was beyond amazing. There are so many images, details and scenes that I seriously cannot get out of my head since watching it for the first time just nine hours ago. The Godfather is so incredibly well-made and acted that it stands out among the rest of those other amazing films I've seen, so much so I couldn't think of a single flaw, and I am struggling to think of a good enough reason to why I didn't see this film before now.True, The Godfather is a little slow-moving and the plot takes a while to unfold, but neither of these are flaws as such. The slow pacing added to the elegiac quality The Godfather has, and as for the plot what is special about this plot is that it is very unpredictable because you have next to no idea where it is next going to take you. Being 18, I was worried whether I was old enough to appreciate this film or even understand it, but luckily I understood it perfectly, and I can well and truly appreciate it for the masterpiece it is considered to be.The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate.Then there is the score by Nina Rota. One word, outstanding! I have heard many wonderful scores in my lifetime, but after hearing this score few stick in the memory as much as the score for The Godfather. This score is both beautiful as seen with the main theme, and haunting in the way it sticks in your head after watching the film itself. Other outstanding assets are the masterly direction from Francis Ford Coppola, and the brilliantly written screenplay that is intelligent, thought-provoking and darkly humorous. As for the violence, some of it is shocking and intense especially in the climax which was enough to almost make your heart either beat twice as fast or stop, and I almost covered my eyes when the producer found the horse's head in his bed, but underneath that this family is somewhat loyal and honourable come to think of it.The acting is absolutely fantastic, bringing to life characters that are rich and complex, perhaps unlikeable at first but as you get to know them you warm to them. And I have to say, The Godfather is one of those rarities where no actor gives a weak performance. In particular, Marlon Brando is brilliant as Don Vito, very heavily disguised yet stately. Every word of dialogue, every subtle hand gesture and every facial expression was brilliantly judged. Al Pacino's casting was admittedly risky, but he still did a truly wonderful job carrying the film, while James Caan is dignified and loyal, Diane Keaton beautiful and alluring and Robert Duvall nicely understated.In conclusion, absolutely amazing, and I can see completely why it is considered one of the 10 greatest movies ever made, it is that good. In fact my 15-year old brother loved it so much, he wants to see it again. 10/10, though this film is too good for that rating. Bethany Cox"
planktonrules,"Mar 30, 2013",10/10,"Up until today, I haven't bothered to review ""The Godfather"". After all, everyone pretty much knows it's one of the greatest films ever made. It's #2 on IMDb's Top 100. It won the Best Picture Oscar. And, there are nearly 1600 reviews on IMDb. So what's one more review?! Well, after completing 14,000 reviews (because I am nuts), I guess it's time I got around to reviewing a film I should have reviewed a long time ago. So, here goes....the film is perfect and only a dope wouldn't watch it. Unfortunately, IMDb requires me to say more to meet it's 10 line minimum for reviews. So, I'll point out that you do NOT need to like gangster films to enjoy this film. Yes, it's violent and nasty in spots--but it's also brilliantly written and produced from start to finish and deserves the accolades it's received.My advice is that instead of just watching ""The Godfather"" and ""The Godfather: Part II"", see the combined version they created for television--with additional scenes that made it a very rich experience."
nathanmanson,"May 8, 2021",7/10,"I'm 21 years old and this is the first time I've watched the godfather. I feel like I've missed something, like I definitely enjoyed the film but it was dragged out way longer then it should've. There was definitely a few pointless scenes. I can understand this was way ahead of its time but I'm obviously watching this 50 years late. Which is the reason I believe I didn't enjoy it as much as the rest of you. If you read the rest of my reviews of old film I actually really enjoyed them so don't blame it on my youth. I'll definitely watch the second one aswell at some point and I'm sure I'll really like that one but I've seen films I've given an 8 that are way better. Marlon won the Oscar for best leading role but I think he should've won best supporting role and Al pacino should've been put up for the Oscar. Marlon wasn't in the film nearly as much as I thought he'd be. All in all it definitely wasn't a bad film, in fact a good film but that's all just a good film."
andalynne,"Jan 29, 2002",5/10,"I was finally forced to watch this 'masterpiece'.  What, exactly, is the redeeming feature of this movie that all these film 'elites' love so much.It was a long, boring, tedious experience I would never want to repeat. Watching old men convince young men to kill other old men was pointless. Was there an actual point to the story?  Or was it crafted just to sell the next installment.This movie has no business being so well-liked and shows what is wrong with both American cimema and the IMDB ranking system."
Leofwine_draca,"Apr 1, 2014",10/10,"THE GODFATHER is quite simply a masterful piece of film-making, an epic in the truest sense of the word and by far the finest gangster film ever shot. Made with finesse, style to spare and a director who elicits pitch-perfect performances from a talented cast, this is movie-making as it should be.Yes, it's a very long film and yes, some sections are quite slow. Nevertheless, none of the film is any less than riveting. The story - of a father/son takeover in one of New York's major Italian Mafia families - is fairly straight forward, and yet Francis Ford Coppola turns it into something else so much more; a meditation on the human condition, perhaps.Certainly this is a film that explores the darker side of humanity. Jealousy, betrayal, anger and revenge are all key themes here, and the film is inevitably punctuated by moments of graphic and shocking violence. And I'm glad Coppola chooses not to shy away from the said violence, which makes it all the more gritty and realistic when it does happen.Marlon Brando takes the showrunner role here, the patriarch who's past his prime, but it's easy to spot the real star of the piece: Al Pacino, who burns up the screen with sheer ferocity. Robert Duvall is easy to miss in a quieter part, but watch out for James Caan whose volatile Sonny is one of the film's most engaging characters. Altogether this is a splendid and unforgettable piece of film-making, which inevitably spawned sequels and a whole gamut of similar gangster fare, but THE GODFATHER towers head and shoulders above them all."
Trevizolga,"Jul 9, 2006",10/10,"I love this movie and all of the GF movies. I see something new every time I have seen it (countless, truly). The story of tragedy and (little) comedy that exists in this film is easily understood by people all over the world. This film has been called an American story however I have met others who have seen this movie in other languages and they seem to have the same love and appreciation for it that I do. I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself. It seems like the entire cast is part of every other movie that I love as well. The sounds, music, color and light in the film are just as much a part of the film as the people. This could be attributed to the method in which it was filmed. At many parts of the film I can still find myself feeling the emotions conveyed in the film. I never tire of appreciating this film. I thank God that FFC is an American treasure. We are fortunate to have him."
The-Other-Monkey,"Aug 6, 2006",10/10,"This must rank as the best film (along with part 2)of all time.An ensemble performance that has no weak spot.Particularly, John Cazale ( Fredo) and Richard Castellano ( Clemenza) give wonderfully understated performances. You just have to believe that Castellano WAS Clemenza, he brings a real touch to his role.John Cazale brings the troubled Fredo to life, and you can see the weak Fredo desperately trying to live up to the family reputation but knowing that he can never be what his father wants.The story of one man's reluctance to be drawn into the murky family business,and his gradual change through circumstance, paints a vivid picture of this violent period of US history.Do not miss this film!"
sirwickmusic,"Oct 21, 2019",10/10,"A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly!This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect.
To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy."
Patronus1,"Jun 13, 2022",7/10,"I must admit, i've never watched the Godfather until now (1 month ago) and as a movie fan i always was ashamed about this. Now i've seen it and might have an unpopular opinion about it.The acting is quite good and the actors also became legends of the Business. The love to little Details is good.But i never get into it.The plot is ok but i wanted more.I wanted to go deeper into the ""why"" and what characters like Michael really think. Why they behave like they do.They just ""looked"" and there was silence.I always was waiting for the catchy moment which will make me feel in love with this so called ""masterpiece"". But it didn't happened and i watched it in 3 parts because i was nearly ""bored"".I was neither surprised about twists, not emotional and not catched by the story. It was just there.The characters are all not so relatable, i didn't felt their feelings.Like robots. You can change theme and you wouldn't even recognize it. If person A,B,C or D gets murdered it doesn't matter.For me: Yes, you can watch it, but for me it is not the masterpiece it should be regarding the reviews.I still need to watch Part 2 and 3. I have it on my list since 1 month, but i didn't do it...that says a lot for myself."
mm-39,"May 16, 2001",10/10,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing.  It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well.  Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses.  Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life.  This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable."
Godz365,"Feb 27, 2019",10/10,"The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
vjeet_a,"Jul 4, 2005",10/10,"The godfather trilogy is an exclusive set of movies that will continue to live with humanity, every generation will see them to say, ""Oh that was 10 out of 10."" If you watch them you will know that the world that lives inside the underworld is same as the one we live in except that people in underworld are so smart, in fact smartness is the only thing that can keep them there. Don Vito Caroleone's early life shown in part-II is very well done to show the Don in making, how a kid who couldn't even tell his name went on becoming a underworld don who keep most senators, judges and lawyers in his pocket. Meeting of don with the so call five families are among most impressive scenes.A saga that goes on for 9 continuous hours takes you around various walks in life of Mike (Don's younger son who become Don later), his school days, love life, personal life, family life, business life, political life and religious life. How all of these different roles Mike plays in his life and how intertwined these are.I enjoyed watching these movies so much, I wish I had seen them much before then I did. Its amazing to see how the Part-III was made 18 years later the part-I was made and everything looks so continuous if watch them together.I need not say much! The Godfather father trilogy been around for a while and everyone knows that they are great set of movies, its just the matter of when you actually get to see them.Watch them! Kudos to Francis Ford Coppola! -Vishy"
sddavis63,"Nov 25, 2002",6/10,"First I have to say that it is very difficult to watch this movie for the first time (which I just did) and approach it with an open mind. The glowing reviews it gets everywhere (many of course calling it the best movie ever made) gives one extremely high expectations and the possibility of being easily disappointed. The many parodies of the movie also give it a cult status that makes one think one knows the story even if one has never seen it.I thought ""The Godfather"" was a good movie, but nothing more than that really. I personally wouldn't call it the greatest movie ever made; not even one of the greatest. It was good, worth watching once and I'm glad I've finally seen it, but nothing more.The portrayal of mob life in the post-war era seemed realistic enough, and the appropriate atmosphere was set. The opening scenes (revolving around Don Corleone's daughter's wedding) gave me mixed feelings. I thought the whole thing went on too long, but it did demonstrate that Corleone's ""business"" never ended - he was constantly meeting with various people looking for favours rather than being front and centre at the wedding. Brando, of course, won (and refused to accept) the Oscar for Best Actor for his portrayal of Corleone, but I wasn't actually taken with his performance. First, I really didn't think of him as the Lead Actor. Al Pacino (as Corleone's son Mike) was, I thought, far more important to the story and far more interesting to watch. Brando had - to me - an almost cartoonish aura around him. Over-rated in my view. But Pacino was excellent, and the character of Mike the most interesting in the movie, as he evolves from the returned war hero who wants nothing to do with the family ""business"" to the eventual ""Don.""It's not that I thought this was a bad movie. It was quite watchable and for the most part very interesting. I just think I've seen better.6/10"
zakcarroll-93753,"Jun 8, 2022",5/10,"The Godfather is considered a ""classic"" gangster film. While Marlin Brando is what most people remember about this movie, he's only in it for 40 mins out of the total 173. The other 133 mins of this film drag on and on. The only thing keeping you there is the hope that Brando will show back up soon. Lots of scenes of guys sitting in cars talking about ""important"" issues. By issues I mean talking about the next guy they're gonna kill. It's just a mediocre film at this point. No real substance and a lot of down time that most people have forgotten about. If this movie was 120 mins long it would be so much more approachable and tolerable. Unfortunately I can only watch two guys sitting and talking about who they're gonna kill so many times in a row before I start to lose interest. Watch it if you must but you're not missing much."
Tolispro,"Mar 30, 2019",10/10,"Alright, this movie is simply perfect. I don't have one bad thing to say about it honestly. Phenomenal acting from few of Hollywood's greatest talents. Al Pacino gives a career defying performance in The Godfather along side Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall and a young Diane Keaton. This movie is simply perfect. This adaptation of Mario Puzo's book tells the tale of an immigrant living the American Dream. But even though all of the starts were absolutely phenomenal in their individual roles only one remains more iconic than the others--Marlon Brando as Don Vito. Fans of the movie will come back and watch it again and again to witness Brando in his absolute finest."
dk777,"Jan 19, 2021",10/10,"One of the best and most complete movies ever. It has absolutely everything, great directing, acting, storytelling and atmosphere.This is not just a story about crime but also a story about family, about good and evil and about how easy it is to succumb to temptation. The film that left a deep mark in film art and I would dare say, in art in general.The cast is exceptional, and Marlon Brando's acting performance is particularly impressive.The characters are fascinating, layered, and the cast really embodied them perfectly. The subtle details with which the director slowly builds the story and atmosphere are excellent.The direction and cinematography are brilliant, everything in the film makes sense and has its place, a truly fascinating film work. This is a truly remarkable story told in the best possible way.A powerful and unforgettable film achievement."
bkoganbing,"Mar 9, 2008",10/10,"My nephew who is all of 17 told me in no uncertain terms that movie making with him starts with The Godfather. He doesn't believe anything made before it is of any great merit. For him The Godfather is like The Birth of a Nation.All three of The Godfather films can bear viewing over and over again. Mario Puzo created such compelling characters and Francis Ford Coppola brought them to life so vividly that you just get sucked in permanently. Like that other mammoth novel about a period, Gone With the Wind, Mario Puzo was like Margaret Mitchell in that there was no way he could top himself after the book was published.Anyone steeped in organized crime history will know a lot about who is being alluded to in all of the Godfather films. Case in point, Alex Rocco who plays the minor character of Moe Green who takes it upon himself to slap Fredo Corleone around. He's also got a cash flow problem at the casino he's running. One would have to have been living on another planet to not know he was referring to Bugsy Siegal.The Godfather story begins at the end of World War II where Marlon Brando rules the roost as Vito Corleone head of one of the large crime families. Two sons, James Caan (Sonny) and John Cazale (Fredo) are in the business and the third Al Pacino (Michael) has just come back from the war a decorated hero. The occasion is the gathering of the clan and friends for daughter Talia Shire (Connie) to Gianni Rizzi (Carlo Russo). All the characters are marvelously introduced and the plot situations laid out beautifully.Marlon Brando who apparently decided that what George C. Scott did was so good in refusing the Oscar for Patton decided to do him one better and send up a bogus Indian princess to tell why. Despite that bit of cheek Brando certainly deserved an Oscar for his performance. Don Vito is compelling as criminal and family man. Brando might have been lucky though in that Al Pacino who really is the main character in all three Godfather films was nominated in the Supporting Actor category.In fact Pacino was nominated with James Caan and Robert Duvall who plays Tom Heggen the family lawyer/consigliere and Brando's adopted son. That three way tie guaranteed the Oscar for Joel Grey in Cabaret with Eddie Albert being nominated for The Heartbreak Kid as the fifth. They're all great, but Pacino should have been in The Best Actor category.Singer Al Martino plays Johnny Fontaine who if you didn't know that this was Frank Sinatra again you'd have to have been living on another planet. In fact the identification is made complete by the fact that Martino sings I Have But One Heart at the Corleone wedding which was an early Sinatra hit. Sinatra was not happy with The Godfather and broke off relations with Martino and with Richard Conte who plays Don Barzini one of the other Mafia Dons. Part of the underside of the Sinatra legend is worked into the plot as well.The images and dialog of The Godfather have entered into our popular culture. The horse's head in John Marley's bed, the cryptic gangster dialog of speaking of an ""offer he can't refuse"", or ""Lucabrazzi sleeps with the fishes"" is all stuff we remember forever after seeing the film.The key scene I think in The Godfather is between the retired Brando and Pacino who has taken over the crime family. Brando isn't happy about the road he took for success, but it's what was available to him. He hoped that Pacino could have stayed out of the family business and had a clean life. It wasn't to be, but maybe the next generation. I think it's beautifully played.In fact it's all beautifully played."
jensenfrederick,"Sep 22, 2020",10/10,"This movie is great in every way. Great plot, great characters, memorable quotes and scenes, and a great representation of the book it's based on. It's a must see for everyone."
Coxer99,"Jun 10, 1999",10/10,"Engrossing motion picture that features some of the finest editing, cinematography and performances ever. There is a wonderful theme of family that runs through this film and its later sequels. No one is truly judged. Love is unconditional. God is the one who truly judges. Easily, the word masterpiece describes this film, but that's been said by so many...Who am I to argue? Masterpiece is right on the money."
cardsrock,"Mar 9, 2019",10/10,This film is pretty much the perfection of the craft. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. There are so many iconic lines and moments throughout the movie that have been replicated and entrenched in culture over the years. There really isn't too much else to say. This is truly the peak of filmmaking.
grantss,"Dec 20, 2015",10/10,"New York, 1945. Don Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando) is the aging Godfather of a mafia family. He has three sons - Sonny (James Caan), Fredo (John Cazale) and Michael (Al Pacino). Sonny is his natural successor but is impulsive, short-tempered and not much of a thinker. Fredo is overly passive. Michael is a war hero and looking to stay out of the family business. The Corleone family and the other four mafia families of New York and New Jersey have been at peace for several years now. Then one of the families decides to get into the illegal narcotics business and wants Don Corleone's help. Don Corleone decides that his family should stay out of narcotics. This has disastrous and far-reaching consequences, consequences that will suck Michael deeper and deeper into the family business.Hard to come up with any more superlatives for this movie, as it is rightfully regarded as one of the greatest movies of all time. Great story, based on the book by Mario Puzo and adapted by Puzo and Francis Ford Coppola. Superb direction by Coppola - some wonderful moments of sensitivity and great drama scenes. Despite being nearly three hours long it doesn't feel like it at all. The movie is very well paced and there's always something happening. Coppola sucks you in from the word go and keeps you enthralled and engaged the whole time.Excellent performances too. Marlon Brando well deserved his Best Actor Oscar, as did Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan their nominations for Best Supporting Actor. The movie launched Pacino's career and revitalised Brando's.Beyond the pure art and entertainment of the movie, it defined, and set the benchmark for, the gangster-drama. There had been gritty crime-dramas before. In the 1930s and 40s we had several excellent James Cagney movies (White Heat from 1949 being the pick of the bunch), as well as the original Scarface and other crime dramas. In the 1940s and 50s there were some great film noir dramas. However, none of these had the grittiness, profundity and sheer breadth and depth of story of The Godfather.So monumental its influence can be seen in the works of Scorsese (Goodfellas, especially), Tarantino, many other directors and, most overtly, the excellent TV series The Sopranos.An all-time classic."
Ser_jorah,"Aug 10, 2022",10/10,"The definition of perfect movie. As if (Marlon Brando) established what a mafia leader should be, with his hoarse voice and cold features, the actors after him were affected by the ghost of his great performance in the movie (The Godfather). Every stare from El Pacino in The Godfather has a story. And the music was. And the music was taking me into another world, making me feel like I am around a mafia gang, or as they say in the movie (the family)."
briancham1994,"Nov 24, 2020",7/10,"I'm ready to be downvoted into oblivion. Intellectually, I can appreciate the style, influence and popularity of this film as attested by its lasting reputation and universally positive reviews. Along with other classics like The Battleship Potemkin and Metropolis, it had a massive impact and has been lauded as a masterpiece. Yet, just like those films, I think it has more value as a piece of film history than an emotional viewing experience in itself. To put it more bluntly, I can see why it was a masterpiece at the time but I don't feel that way when I watch it now.For sure, I'll give it plenty of credit for its acting and atmosphere. The cinematographic techniques add a soft, dreamlike quality to everything. The portrayal of the gangsters seemed (as far as I know) grounded and humanistic, not caricatured. However, there are definitely parts where it drags on and didn't feel engaging. If I watched this with no expectations and no idea of its status, I'd probably just think it's a well made film from an older era but nothing earth-shattering."
tfrizzell,"Mar 24, 2004",N/A,"""The Godfather"" is so smart, so well written (an Oscar winner for Best Adapted Screenplay) and so well performed that it would have succeeded under the very worst of circumstances. Marlon Brando (Oscar-winning, even though he refused the award) gives the performance of a lifetime as the head of a Mafia family that will do anything and everything to dominate organized crime in post-World War II New York City. However, the face of crime is quickly changing and other syndicates are targeting Brando to eliminate him as competition. What no one figured was that youngest son Al Pacino (Oscar-nominated) may be even more ruthless and maniacal than his father. Robert Duvall and James Caan both received Oscar nominations for their roles in the wicked mix. Diane Keaton, Talia Shire, Abe Vigoda and John Cazale all do arguably the best work of their respective careers. ""The Godfather"" is epic film-making which ended up being the first true picture to deal with the topic in a non-film noir style. It is an amazing achievement which is probably the best movie produced in the 1970s (that is saying a whole lot by the way) and quite possibly the greatest motion picture of all time. An excellent movie from every cinematic angle imaginable. 5 stars out of 5."
SeminolePhenom,"Jul 25, 2005",10/10,"Before giving a summary of this classic, let me just say that this is ""The Masterpiece of all Masterpieces"" when it comes to movies. When I review movies, I consider the godfather as the greatest of all time and rate the movies according. There is no greater movie than this one.Don Vito Corleone(Marlon Brando, is The Godfather of the ""Corleone Family Mafia"". Michael Corleone(Al Pacino) returns from war with no intention of joining the family business. Bad blood between the heads of the five families cause a shooting on Don Vito, which keeps Michael away from Kay Adams(Diane Keaton), his girlfriend, and closer to his family with Sonny (James Caan), Fredo(John Cazale), Connie(Taila Shire), and family lawyer Tom Hagen(Robert Duvall). Sonny takes over the family business through Don Vito's bad health and takes very aggressive action. A war is created between the heads of the family, leading to assassinations, betrayal, revenge, and suffering on all parts. To end this chaos, Michael Corleone takes over the family business with his father as his adviser.The movie is absolutely flawless. The lighting is incredible. It's so dark at some points that Brando's eyes are shadowed. The acting is insanely great. Brando does a better acting job in The Godfather, than he does in On the Waterfront. Pacino's acting is superb. He stars in his first major role, leading to many great performances following. James Caan, Robert Duvall, and Diane Keaton give great performances as well. The movie received 4 Oscar nominations for acting alone(Brando in leading role/ Pacino, Caan, and Duvall in supporting role). The movie was nominated for 11 academy awards and won 3 of them (Best Picture, Best Screenplay, and Best Actor-Marlon Brando)in 1972.Overall, the movie is flawless in every aspect that a critic looks for. It is highly entertaining, shocking, and tear jerking of epic proportions.I highly recommend this movie."
Julius_Lang,"Jan 13, 2025",10/10,"I truly wish all those who believe this film is boring and overrated can understand it one day.Everything in The Godfather is executed to the utmost degree.Characters- Each member of the family is very distinct. From the very serious Tom to wacky Clemenza to fiery Sonny to wise and calculated Vito to cold Michael, The Godfather has very colorful characters.Cinematography- Gordon Willis, the main cinematographer of The Godfather does an excellent job portraying a gritty city, riddled with crime. There are beautiful shots of the urban landscape. My favorite in particular is the one with the Statue of Liberty, the black car and the grainy field.Setting- The Godfather taking place over 10 years is perfect. Starting with the end of WW2, with Michael being a veteran and all and ending 10 years later, no longer being loyal to his country but to the family.Writing- There's a reason it's up there with Chinatown and Casablanca as a film among the top three greatest American screenplays. The slow descent of madness is perfectly executed.10/10. Only seen it once but everything has been ingrained into my memory."
athenlyre,"Jul 4, 2024",10/10,"The Godfather is a strong contender for the best film ever made. I'd argue that it is the ultimate gangster movie.Don't worry about the nearly three-hour runtime; you won't even notice the time passing, it flies by.The production values are astounding, with a visual appeal that remains impressive throughout. At around fifty years old, it outshines many modern films.With performances by Brando, Pacino, and Castellano, among others, the acting is phenomenal.If you're considering a hard copy, I recommend the Blu-ray version; it's sharper than the DVD, and the difference is noticeable.This film has had a significant influence over the years and will always be one of the greatest. 10/10."
utgard14,"Jul 15, 2014",10/10,"The Godfather, for the few of you who don't already know, is about the Corleone mafia family struggling to survive a war with a rival family. That's about as simplistic a summary as you can get for this masterpiece. There's no way to describe it in a few simple lines and there's already a ton of excellent, well-thought-out reviews here on IMDb. There's really very little I can add to the overwhelming praise for this film. It's obviously one of the greatest movies of all time and its reputation as such is well-deserved. The direction, the cast, the score, the script are as good as it gets. The whole production is as flawless as you're likely to find on any film. There isn't a thing about it I would change. It's one of those movies you have to see at least once before you die."
auuwws,"Sep 15, 2020",10/10,"The Godfather deserves to be called the best movie in history, and from my personal point of view, nothing is wrong with it"
BrandtSponseller,"Apr 24, 2005",10/10,"Marlon Brando is Don Vito Corleone, head of perhaps the most powerful New York-area mafia family in the 1940s, in this well-respected film by director/writer Francis Ford Coppola. As the film begins, Vito is receiving ""business"" guests in his office at his home while his daughter Connie's (Talia Shire) wedding and reception are taking place. The epic plot takes place over many years, telling the story of Vito, his family--including Michael (Al Pacino), Santino (James Caan) and Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall), his associates, and their interactions with other mob syndicates.The Godfather is commonly considered to be one of the ""greatest films of all time"". Even though I've given it a 10, I wouldn't put that same kind of exalted emphasis on it. I've given literally thousands of films 10s over the years, and for me, Godfather just barely made a 10. I think it has a number of flaws, but Coppola also has a knack for transcending the problems with some brilliant move or another. At any rate, it is definitely must-see viewing--even if it's only because it's so highly regarded--if you've not experienced the film yet. I think it's a good idea to attain cultural literacy, and films as popularly loved as The Godfather become necessary elements in achieving that literacy.Shorn of its gangster trappings, The Godfather is sprawling and soap-operatic in tone. The sprawl is appropriate to its origins as a novel by Mario Puzo, who also co-wrote the screenplay with Coppola. There is a large cast of characters--maybe too large, as it can be difficult to keep track of just who everyone is. Even after you've watched the film a couple times you may find scenes where mobsters seem to spontaneously appear and you catch yourself saying, ""Wait, who is that guy supposed to be again?"" The soap opera angle can be a positive or negative depending on your tastes. I tend to not like soap-operatic stories, but of course Coppola put yummy gangster topping on this one to make it palatable for guys like me. At root, though, The Godfather is concerned with realistic depictions of a very dysfunctional family as they try to make it through life--including marriages, births, adultery, spats between family members, tiffs with others in their community, and so on. My theory is that the soap opera angle accounts for much of the film's appeal. For me, it (and the slight lack of focus from the sprawl) accounts for much of the reason that I barely gave the film a 10.But two things help the film transcend a lower score for me. Even though the gangster stuff has been far surpassed in graphic brutality in the intervening years, the dramatic context of the violence usually gives it tremendous impact. Films like Ichi the Killer (2001), which I just watched for the first time the night before watching The Godfather again, make the Godfather's brutality fit for Sesame Street in comparison. However, although Ichi's violence is effective, setting that knob to ""11"" doesn't make it better. Besides, Ichi is so over the top that it would make many Godfather fans want to hurl.To the extent that Coppola and Puzo just focus on the extended Corleone family, they create tremendous depth in their relationships. The whole film can be looked at as a fascinating depiction of ""oscillating"" dynamics in the family, with the pole pairs being interacting/distancing, control/lack of control, benevolence/malevolence. Most character stances and actions are some combination of those ranges of characteristics, and everyone dances around the poles, so to speak, throughout the film. From this angle, even the attractive surface violence (well, attractive to us fans of that stuff in artworks) is mainly there for the purpose of pushing characters more to one pole or the other. There is an implication that underlying these mechanisms is some natural tendency towards achieving (a dynamic) equilibrium.But there are more superficial stylistic factors that help push my score up to a 10, also. The most obvious, which everyone and their grandparents have mentioned, are the performances. It's tough to go wrong when you have a cast including Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, Robert Duvall, James Caan, Diane Keaton, and so on. Another commonly mentioned element that I agree is fantastic and superbly integrated to create atmosphere is Nino Rota's score.Less often mentioned is the consistently intriguing cinematography by Gordon Willis. Most of Willis' unusual shots in the film are so subtle as to be barely noticeable unless you're looking for them. The opening, for example, consists of a long (it lasts a few minutes) ""zoom out"" from Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto). The shot is beautifully lit--most of the frame is extremely dark, giving Bonasera a chiaroscuro effect (the opening is also unusual in that it's a long monologue from a minor character).Willis and Coppola have a knack for placing their actors in the frame to create depth and interesting visual patterns. This is done so slyly that at first blush you wouldn't believe it's something they thought about, but if you keep this in mind while watching, you can see delightful visual paths that zigzag, wind to a focal point, and so on, all created by the confluence of actors and scenery in the frame.If you haven't seen The Godfather before, the most important thing you can do before watching is to forget about all of the ""greatest film of all time"" hype. That's only likely to set up expectations that could never be met; more than likely you'll be disappointed. Just think of it as one of the better films from one of Hollywood's more admirable but relatively odder directors, featuring earlier performances from a very well known cast, and keep in mind that it's as much a ""historical family saga"" as a crime or gangster film."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 28, 2013",10/10,"Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) is the head of a Mafia family. Sonny (James Caan) is his eldest and heir apparent. Michael (Al Pacino) is a return WWII hero and wants to keep out of the family business. The Don refuses to go into the drug business which precipitate a mob war.There is no doubt that this is one of the greatest movie of all times. Director Francis Ford Coppola has crafted a masterpiece from Mario Puzo's novel. It is not just a great story, but great characters and great actors playing them. Forty years later, it's still as compelling as ever. The pacing is slower than today's standard, but it packs a punch more potent than anything recent. The acting power alone is incredible. When you consider that Al Pacino is the new unknown kid, the cast is unquestionable the best that Hollywood has to offer in that era. Every 10 minutes, there is an iconic scene. There is no way I can list them all.I rarely give a 10. Rarer still do I give it with no reservation. A perfect movie is not enough. It has to have cultural significance and some originality. That is 'The Godfather'. It is still being referenced today. May all the haters sleep with the fishes."
chiragrathod09,"Jul 16, 2024",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" is not just a film; it's a cultural phenomenon that has shaped the landscape of cinema since its release in 1972. At its core, the film tells the gripping tale of the Corleone family, a powerful Italian-American mafia clan navigating loyalty, power, and the complexities of family ties.One of the most striking aspects of ""The Godfather"" is its meticulous storytelling. The screenplay, based on Mario Puzo's novel, expertly balances the personal and the political, allowing viewers to engage deeply with the characters' motivations and struggles. The film unfolds at a deliberate pace, giving weight to each decision made by its characters, immersing the audience in the intricate dynamics of the mafia underworld.The performances are nothing short of extraordinary, with Marlon Brando's portrayal of Vito Corleone becoming iconic. Brando brings a blend of gravitas and vulnerability to the role, making the patriarch a figure of both fear and respect. Al Pacino shines as Michael Corleone, transitioning from the reluctant outsider to a central figure in the family's operations, showcasing a powerful character arc that captivates throughout the film.Visually, ""The Godfather"" is a masterpiece. Cinematographer Gordon Willis uses shadow and light to enhance the film's mood, creating a dark, atmospheric aesthetic that reinforces the themes of secrecy and corruption. The iconic score by Nino Rota complements the film beautifully, adding emotional depth to its memorable scenes.When using the word 'epic' one should never use it lightly where movies are concerned. This movie is an epic, in every sense of the word.Ultimately, ""The Godfather"" is a profound exploration of power, morality, and family. Its intricate plot, compelling characters, and artistic craftsmanship make it a timeless classic that continues to resonate with audiences today. Whether you're a first-time viewer or revisiting the film, ""The Godfather"" remains a must-see cinematic experience that reaffirms its status as the greatest films ever made.#masterpiece= 10/10🔥"
ameyakannur-03300,"May 17, 2020",7/10,"This movie is a great piece of work no doubt about that. The acting is natural, the direction is good and cinematography even better. When they say that every frame is a painting...they mean it. And the brilliantly exicuted deaths of whoever dies in this movie.
But
The problem is that it didn't match the hype for me.
It was suggested to Me by my friend and he said that this was the best movie he had ever saw. As he had seen a lot of movies I decided to watch this movie. This movie is boring in some parts and not completely interesting throughout. I finished this movie in 5 sittings. The scenes are unnecessarily dragged for no reason at all.
And I tried hard to really root for the characters which didn't happen in my case.
The bgm is great.....but to use the same bgm again and again got me irritated.Overall great movie but highly overrated and boring"
CinemaClown,"Jan 5, 2016",N/A,"Immortal for its contribution to cinema & one of the prime examples of filmmaking art, The Godfather is a remarkable inside-out look at the life of a mafia family that also paints an astounding portrait of organised crime. Scoring full marks in all aspects of filmmaking, be it direction, screenplay, acting, cinematography, editing or music, this crime drama immerses viewers into its world from the very beginning and narrates its story with such strong magnetic grip for the next three hours that it's impossible to not be impressed & amazed by it. Even after so many viewings, there is nothing to complain about this classic, there is no weakness to exploit and with each view, the respect for this motion picture masterpiece only gets higher.Based on the novel of the same name by Mario Puzo, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, a respectable & powerful family having major underworld influences which are overseen by Don Vito Corleone, who is termed as Godfather by his peers as a token of respect. But when Don Corleone refuses to enter the drug business, a series of events are set in motion which results in an assassination attempt on the Don, increasing rivalries among the mafia families, and paves way for Don's youngest son to rise & take up his father's job in order to protect his family and to settle all disputes. The film revolves around Michael Corleone (Don's youngest son) and even the main plot of the story is the evolution of Michael from a doe-eyed outsider, who didn't want to get into the family business, into a ruthless boss later in the story.The direction by Francis Ford Coppola is no short of amazement. The way he filmed most of the scenes from the very beginning to the end, the casting decisions he made, the chosen locations for shooting, the remarkable screenplay & memorable quotes co-written with Mario Puzo and the overall style of narration & look of the film, it's all brilliantly done. Cinematography is carried out beautifully and the decision to shoot in Technicolor print pays off enormously well for it provided this film a vintage look that wonderfully matched the timeline it represented and also added an artistic flair to the whole medium. Editing is very precisely done with each character getting enough time on-screen without robbing its expertly controlled pace. Nino Rota's score opens the film with a sad, almost funeral-like theme music, and boasts tracks which sound very unusual for a crime drama but then it also fits the film's ambiance remarkably well. The overall work by the entire technical crew is as much responsible for this film's success as the direction, writing & performances.As far as performances go, The Godfather features a cast of incredibly gifted actors in Marlon Brando, James Caan, Al Pacino, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Diane Keaton, Richard S. Castellano, Talia Shire, Al Lettieri & many more, and every one of them is in top-notch form. Marlon Brando makes Don Corleone truly his own, giving his character a set of unique look & traits and delivers, possibly, the greatest performance of all time which also immortalised the character of Don Corleone in cinema forever and permanently engraved Brando's status as one of world's finest actors. Al Pacino also makes his mark on the big stage and delivers the next great performance as Michael Corleone, plus his rise to power from a reluctant outsider into a ruthless mafia boss remains one of the most spectacular character arcs ever exhibited on film canvas. James Caan stars as Sonny Corleone, Don's hot-headed eldest son, and I don't recall Caan delivering any other performance of this calibre and same goes for Richard S. Castellano who plays Clemenza, a caporegime for the Corleone family. Other notable works include Robert Duvall as Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton as Kay Adams, Talia Shire as Connie Corleone, Abe Vigoda as Tessio & Al Lettieri as Virgil Sollozzo. All in all, there are no complains in this department either.Telling a tale that spans ten years of the Corleone family in three hours, while also reflecting the world of organised crime with immense character depth & complexity unlike anything before it, and ingeniously blending it with impressive direction, sturdy writing, impeccable performances, striking quotes, innovative storytelling & a mesmerizing score, The Godfather is an exceptionally well-made motion picture and certainly the one with the best cast. Ever since its release, it has become the benchmark by which all the great masterpieces are measured and its influence on cinema, especially gangster genre, is unprecedented. On an overall scale, The Godfather is universally accepted as one of world cinema's finest films, arguably the greatest ever, and the performances by Marlon Brando & Al Pacino alone are the stuff of legends. Plus, this films also marks a significant moment in cinema, in my opinion, in which the baton was passed from Marlon Brando, the finest actor of his generation, to Al Pacino who later became the finest actor of the subsequent era. The film doesn't need my recommendation because it's a must watch for every cinema lover. There are very few movies which are unanimously hailed as a great one from critics, filmmakers & viewers all around the world and The Godfather is unquestionably one of those classics and, in my opinion, the only one that deserves the top spot. A cinematic treasure you should neither refuse nor ignore, The Godfather is genre filmmaking at its most perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline & pure. One hundred percent recommended."

ivo-cobra8,"Oct 17, 2015",10/10,"The Godfather (1972) is Francis Ford Coppola's epic classic masterpiece and is one of the best crime films in the world that it ever was made. It is my favorite best film and I will always watch it. None of the movies like are The Godfather didn't make or did a job well done like Mario Puzo's The Godfather. The Godfather is a 1972 film about a Mafia crime family and the outbreak of a New York City gang war in the late 1940s. One of the original ""Movie Brats"" who had not had a hit after seven films, director Coppola collaborated on the epic film's screenplay with Mario Puzo who had written a best-selling novel of the same name about a Mafia dynasty (the Corleones). The Godfather catapulted Francis Ford Coppola to directorial superstardom, and popularized the following euphemistic phrase (of brutal coercion): ""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse."" I love this film to death! Marlon Brando's performance is one of his best, the acting in here is superb and awesome. Marlon Brando's the most memorable character. The only two films that he later made were Superman (1978) and Apocalypse Now (1979) that were a major hit in the box office. He never made in to making any sequels so those three films are his brilliant performances that are known today. Al Pacino played Michael Corleone superb and brilliant. I love that this film is set in In late summer 1945 and shows how the history really was. When the aging head of a famous crime family decides to transfer his position to one of his subalterns, a series of unfortunate events start happening to the family, and a war begins between all the well-known families leading to insolence, deportation, murder and revenge, and ends with the favorable successor being finally chosen. The Best of the best film of the world I love it!!!!The superb, three-part gangster saga was inaugurated with this film from Italian-American director Francis Ford Coppola, The Godfather (1972). The first two parts of the lush and grand saga are among the most celebrated, landmark films of all time. Many film reviewers consider the second part equal or superior to the original, although the first part was a tremendous critical and commercial success - and the highest grossing film of its time. This mythic, tragic film contributed to a resurgence in the American film industry, after a decade of competition from cinema abroad.Francis Ford Coppola's epic features Marlon Brando in his Oscar-winning role as the patriarch of the Corleone family. Director Coppola paints a chilling portrait of the Sicilian clan's rise and near fall from power in America, masterfully balancing the story between the Corleone's family life and the ugly crime business in which they are engaged. Based on Mario Puzo's best-selling novel and featuring career-making performances by Al Pacino, James Caan and Robert Duvall, this searing and brilliant film garnered ten Academy Award nominations, and won three including Best Picture of 1972. (Paramount Pictures)The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Albert S. Ruddy from a screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola. Starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as the leaders of the fictional Corleone New York crime family, the story spans the years 1945-55, concentrating on the transformation of Michael Corleone from reluctant family outsider to ruthless Mafia boss while chronicling the family under the patriarch Vito.Definitely one of the best crime gangster movie of all time. The movie that changed the history forever! Francis Ford Coppola's direction was superb and fantastic, not even that he shot with camera scenes that is impossible to lost. The film has character development, a terrific cast and awesome epic scenes that I love. Talia Shire as Connie Corleone did a wonderful fantastic job as Michael's Sister and Vito's daughter.

bobsgrock,"Nov 17, 2009",10/10,"The mafia was always seen as evil, secretive and not interesting enough to be a story. Then came The Godfather and today countless movies and television shows take place about gangsters and the mafia. But what a great risk it must have been for Francis Ford Coppola to adapt Mario Puzo's best-seller to the big screen. He succeeded in the two areas I believe are the most important in film: acting and writing.The screenplay by Coppola and Puzo is one of the tightest and carefully constructed scripts of any movie. The film takes place completely within the world of the Corleone family, so we are never asked to hate these people nor sympathize with them. Yet we do, due to the countless scenes involving them eating, drinking, talking. There is a 30 minute wedding scene in the beginning that sets the mood and tone, showing how these people have taken advantage of the American dream. Now that we know them, we care for what happens to them despite the fact that they are evil.The acting is so powerful, so effective that it is impossible to think anyone could have filled these roles instead. Al Pacino, who was hated by the producers but loved by Coppola, plays Michael very straight and emotionless. His blank stare says everything and nothing, but all along we see change and it is his change of heart and personality that is the most amazing development in the whole film. James Caan is perfect as the hot-headed Sonny, Robert Duvall perfect as the level-headed Tom Hagen, and of course Marlon Brando overtakes everyone as the aging patriarch, Don Vito Corleone. Brando is usually considered the greatest actor ever, and here he goes full length, portraying a man who has been in America most of his life and is growing weary of the direction in which business seems to be going.The Godfather is one of the best films ever if only for the fact that it is able to suck you in completely to this world. It is long but never plods and always builds with every scene. Indeed, each early scene is somewhat of a set-up for something later. The actors all play it so straight and smooth, everything is completely convincing. And Gordon Willis' dark, moody photography adds to the drama, evoking hidden agendas and secrets. Nino Rota composed one of the most famous of all movie themes, and here it seems to tell us that life is going to get bad and we should have listened to Don Vito. This film put Coppola on the map and made him a director to reckon with. Just like the Corleones."
snoozejonc,"Feb 27, 2022",10/10,"This is one of the greatest movies of all time.I recently watched the 50th anniversary theatrical release, and it was an epic cinema experience. It speaks volumes that I have watched it multiple times, and those 178 minutes still fly by.Some movies are designed for entertainment, whilst others are more of an artistic expression. The Godfather does both incredibly well.Every scene is beautifully shot with great visual storytelling, and they all combine to form a very compelling plot and an unforgettable presentation of characters.It has what is often regarded as the greatest opening scene and character establishments in movie history, and it's hard to disagree. Another great aspect is the shot framing of Al Pacino and how it changes as the character Michael develops throughout the story. Also, the shots of Diane Keaton place her character, Kay, outside of the 'family' in numerous situations. The famous 'Baptism of Fire' sequence, despite its incredibly dark subject matter, is a truly amazing piece of filmmaking.Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale, Talia Shire, and Richard Castellano are all brilliant, along with the rest of the cast. They portray characters that we should never like in a million years, but cannot help doing so.The 1970s were another golden era in Hollywood filmmaking, and The Godfather was one of the best examples."
crendine,"Mar 24, 2015",10/10,"This film contains all the elements of a genuine masterpiece. Its attention to detail, history, and tradition. An absolutely wonderful screenplay. Its comparative closeness to the novel and a storyline which became the template for future stories in this genre. As for the performances: there is not one single character flaw in this entire cast. What continues to amaze me about this film more than any other is the fact that not only were the correct actors and actresses chosen for the roles but that they were each chosen at the perfect point in their respective careers. Throughout this film, there is not one actor nor actress who seems ""too old or young for the part"". Nor does anyone (including an extremely strong Diane Keaton) seem ""out of place"" or ""unconvincing"". The plot and storyline could not have been better and this is one film that no matter how many times you've seen it, it still continues to amaze, entertain, and (in some ways) inform. Like some of the classics which preceded it, it holds up very well over time and will probably continue to do so. I currently own on VHS ""The Godfather Saga"" (the first 2 movies woven together in chronological order) which is absolutely amazing. It begins with the birth of Vito and ends with the eventual rise of Michael. Although Francis Ford Coppola does not like this version of his epic, I sure wish he would release it on DVD."

But none of the characters felt human enough to care about any of them.

rebeljenn,"Nov 30, 2005",5/10,"'The Godfather' is one of the most well-known films of all time, and its popularity has made it a legend. It is the ultimate Mafia film. The film crops up in everyday conversation: the memorable scene with the horse's severed head and the dead of the Mafia man in the tomato garden while he is chasing the little boy around. It's one of those films that some consider the best film ever made -- that is, by some people but not by me. While I thought that some of the scenes and story were done brilliantly, some of the film was difficult to follow. I've seen much better films that 'The Godfather', and despite some of the good scenes and the photography, I would only classify it as an average film. Good, and it probably could not have any better, but it just failed to really inspire me as a film."
perica-43151,"Jul 20, 2018",10/10,"This movie is often considered the best ever. And it lives to the hype, everyone should see this movie at some point. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
mjneu59,"Nov 22, 2010",10/10,"The first words in Francis Coppola's organized crime saga (""I believe in America"") are spoken by a wronged father seeking justice from Mafia Don Vito Corleone, and with an immigrant's passion invoke the spirit of his adapted homeland. It's an ironic gesture in a film which embraces the American Dream with a vengeance, beginning with a joyful celebration of marriage, ending with a solemn Catholic Church baptism, and continuing in between with murder after bloody murder: for vengeance; for punishment; or (with a severed horse head under the bed sheets) simply for leverage. The film gained notoriety for such epic displays of gangland violence, but its real power lies in nuance: a shading of phrase; a deceptive fall of lamplight; the sound of footsteps on a hospital stairway. Credit goes to co-writers Coppola and Mario Puzo for the leisurely paced but tightly plotted screenplay, by itself a remarkable study in contrasts, showing the thin line dividing patriotism and graft; honor and brutality; family affections and ritual violence. Seeing Part One independent from its companion/sequel is like reading only the middle chapters of a long and complex historical novel, rich in detail and drama, about an immigrant family coping with changing times in the New World. The result is one of the few truly effective adaptations of a popular novel, and together with Part Two perhaps the last word in gangster film dramas."
Kpmtaxes,"Jun 30, 2013",10/10,"I was present when the filming of the Horse's head scene was done. I was a Police Officer in 1970 for the Nassau County Police Department, New York. I believe in the mid part of 1971, I was assigned, along with about 10 other officers and a Sergeant, to be at the Guggenheim Estate, Sands Point, Nassau County, NY. This estate was County property. The filming of the Horse's head scene and the dining room scene where Robert Duvall requests John Marley to give a film/singing role to one of the Don's relatives. Marley declines Duvall as you see a horse prancing in the meadow outside. Duvall says he will tell the Don in NY. Marley shrugs off Duvall. I was within 50' of both scenes. Coppola actually used real heads of horses ( they were shipped in ice in huge crates, they mixed a blood concoction). Coppola actually was very picky about the head he wanted to use. When Marley opens the sheet and discovers the head, it looks like sunrise. It was actually raining outside, and yellow cellophane was put on the windows. With the proper lighting, it looks like the sun was coming up, yet it was raining outside. The scene of the horse prancing outside was done at another location. The Guggenheim family were very rich and had art collections, etc throughout the mansion. The police were there to safeguard any of these collections. My girlfriend (now wife of over 41 years) was away at college. Banks of phones were set up. I was on the phone talking for a long time each of the three or four days assigned there. I was young and did not realize the assignment that I was on would be so important in the movie world. There were plenty of staff, extras, etc there. We were there for over 10/12 hours per day. Meals were catered. I also was assigned on traffic sometime later near the toll booth scene, filmed out on the old Mitchel Field Air Base. If you look close, at the toll booth, yellow parking lines are on the ground. Lindbergh, a friend of Guggenheim, flew from nearby Roosevelt Field. Somewhere in my attic, is my police memo book with exact dates when assigned as a ""rookie"" to the making of ""The Godfather"". Well, I guess I said enough, contact me if you need any more information. BTW, I retired in 2003, 33 year career. I became a supervisor in 1987 and was assigned to several movie filming on the ""Gold Coast"" of Long Island. One was the new version of ""Sabrina"", starring Harrison Ford....PS I never saw Marlon Brando, I think other scenes were done in Staten Island, part of NYC....thanks..."
ericjg623,"Apr 4, 2002",8/10,"One thing that's a bit annoying when seeing `The Godfather' is the sense that, as a viewer, you feel you are required to bow down before this film and worship it as movie perfection, or else reveal yourself to be a person of no taste. Well, I can definitely acknowledge that this is a very good movie, but not necessarily great, nor is it on my personal favorites list.For starters, while this definitely gives you some great characters and atmosphere, there's really nothing in this movie that you couldn't get from reading the book. In fact, the strength of this film comes from the way the director and actors faithfully bring the novel to life.What's best? No question - the acting. Judged on that scale alone, it gets a 10. I cannot disagree with those who state that this combines the best acting performances in American film history. The directing and scriptwriting are also very good, worthy of at least a 9.What's not so good? The pacing. As others have noted, this film can be boring at times. Most notably, at least for me, was the time spent showing Mike in Sicily after he shot the cop and the Turk. Other than getting married, it doesn't really show him doing much of anything, nor does it really contribute much to the story. In contrast, the book made this particular sub-plot far more interesting and relevant.And that, at heart, is my problem. I've seen the movie and I've read the book. And I far more enjoyed the latter. The book gives all sorts of details the movie skips. For example, in the film, Al Neri is just a guy dressed up as a cop who performs as one of Mike's hit men. In the book, we learn how he went from being a good cop with a bad temper to taking over the role once held by Luca Brasi (another character who is developed far more fully in the book).So there you have it. On the one hand, you have to intellectually acknowledge the great talent displayed in the making of this film, but on the other, I must admit it just isn't very satisfying emotionally. These characters seem cold and distant, and I never really cared much for any of them. In that respect, I much more preferred ""Goodfellas"". The acting wasn't as good, but the characters were far more engaging and the pacing much more lively. In short, `The Godfather' is sort of like a great, but somber, piece of music, something you can admire but not dance to.8/10"
antuongha,"Feb 21, 2021",9/10,"This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. Every single aspect of The Godfather is outstanding. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 49 years old and has aged well. The Hollywood at its best, with some money and advice taken in from the mob itself. A classic."
miladturin,"Sep 2, 2022",10/10,"The best thing to say is to watch the movie yourself!The Godfather for one thing looks stunning. I strongly disagree with the previous reviewer who said the cinematography was horrid, for me the cinematography was one of the best assets of the film. In some scenes you have cinematography and lighting that is quite dark and mysterious, and then in scenes such as the wedding it is evergreen, autumnal and very picturesque. It is not just the cinematography that makes The Godfather look stunning, the costumes are beautifully tailored, the houses are gorgeous and majestic to look at and even the cars were immaculate."
t-turnquest1,"Mar 20, 2015",10/10,"The Godfather is one of the most iconic films in cinema history. There are three points in the film that made it stand alone: direction, acting, and writing.The direction of this film was great! Frances Fran Coppela really knows how to make a great film. Like Steven Spilberg, Peter Jackson, James Cameron, and so many others, he as list himself as one of the most greatest directors in Hollywood. He's my role model.The acting was terrible, just kidding! :) The Acting was amazing. Marlon Brando carries the anchor of this movie, but Al Pacino holds it carefully. The cast of this movie was a good example of cast chemistry. Great Cast!The Writing was awesome. Coppela knows what he is doing when he is writing a script to a major blockbuster hit. That's why he's my role model.The Godfather is one my favorite films of all time. I would recommend you see this movie. It's awesome."
preppy-3,"Apr 22, 2019",10/10,"Epic film about a Mafia family called the Corleones. It takes place from the 1940s to 1950s. The family is overseen by Don Corleone (Marlon Brando). His sons help their father...except for his youngest Michael (Al Pacino). He wants no part of the family business...but he might have no choice.A fantastic film. It runs three hours but you're never bored. It's wonderfully directed by Francis Ford Coppola. It also is one of those rare films with a perfect cast--no one is bad! It's also fun to see Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall and Diane Keaton so young and full of life. Many of the lines (""I'll make him an offer he can't refuse"") have become legendary. Also there is some violence which was considered extreme in 1972 but is pretty tame today. Only a character getting shoot at a toll booth is pretty over the top. My favorite scene has to be at the end when Keaton realizes what she's married into. The look on her face is perfect.This was a HUGE hit at the box office. It was loved by critics and the public alike. It was (rightfully) called the Gone With the Wind of the 1970s. A masterpiece and well worth seeing."
LeonLouisRicci,"Jul 7, 2013",10/10,"One of the many things that stand the test of time in this Film is how the rich and deeply colored softness of the image doesn't seem at all dated, in fact, it is a beautiful way of peddling the presentation. A testament to its Artistic framing. It is the Art of the Godfather that along with the Characters and the forbidden, to outsiders, World of the Mafia that make this a memorable monument to the craft of Filmmaking.The period detail and the Casting are another spot on representation of these larger than Life Characters and their primal environment. So there is the look, the Actors, the semi-whispered dialog in tightly confined rooms, the verboten landscape, and the fact that these People are not real but are a realization of expectations and surprises.This may not be the best Film of all time, can a claim like that for any one Movie be taken seriously, but it is certainly a most finely crafted work of Art. Its influence can hardly be measured, and although the Director only came close to the two Godfather Movies with the incredible Apocalypse Now (1979), he will forever be noticed as the creative force behind Godfather and Godfather II that are both worthy inclusions in any Best Films list."
Wiizardii321,"Mar 15, 2015",10/10,"So at first I always heard from a lot of people when I was younger that Godfather was the most epic movie of all time, I always memorized Vito Corleone's face when I was a kid... Years later I decided it's time I watch this movie and I did it on Netflix. Oh, and when I did, it was so good...The sharp chemistry is what makes up most of the stuff, these actors always just transcend and transcend so much. Vito Corleone is one of the best movie characters ever. And the performances? These actors gave one of the best performances of all time. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone is arguably his best performance ever. I can't say enough of Marlon Brando. Do I need to state the obvious? He is the best for a reason. I would go on forever on Godfather and why it is my favourite movie of all time, but that would be more than 1,000 words. If you haven't watched this, give it a try and see to yourself - a masterpiece.What ALSO makes the godfather so special is it's line of who is a hero and a villain, can one really call a calm guy like Vito Corleone a bad guy? Technically he should be because, well because.. He is, a good... bla bla bla, it all just goes into your mind and it challenges you. I always saw Vito as a hero, but as Godfather grew more on me, I thought he was more like an Anti-hero. As for Michael, he will always be an anti hero in my opinion. Godfather gives out the most blend and epic characters in fiction history ever, let alone movies."
BA_Harrison,"Mar 6, 2016",10/10,"The Godfather used to hold the top spot in IMDb's Top 250 movies list; it now sits at number two, behind Frank Darabont's emotionally manipulative crowd-pleaser The Shawshank Redemption, which has become the go-to title for people who can't be arsed to think for themselves when it comes to naming their favourite film. People clearly aren't showing The Godfather enough respect (perhaps they need to be taught a lesson, capiche?).In my opinion, Francis Ford Coppola's sweeping Mafia epic (based on Mario Puza's bestselling novel) trumps Shawshank in every wayThe film boasts a superior cast headed by Marlon Brando and Al Pacino, with excellent support from James Caan and Robert Duvall; Tom Robbins and Morgan Fairchild are simply no match.Coppola's storytelling is impeccable from start to finish, drawing the viewer into the film as inextricably as Michael Corleone (Pacino) is drawn into the sinister, violent underworld of Sicilian organised crime. Darabont does a reasonable enough job at papering over Shawshank's plot holes, but fails to lend his film the sense of style and class so evident in every scene of the Godfather.Nino Rota's score for Coppola's movie is sublime, a majestic piece of music so emotive that just a few notes evoke an entire genre. I can't even recall Shawshank's score.Rather unsurprisingly, The Shawshank Redemption deals with the theme of redemption, and closes with a contrived feel-good ending. The Godfather is darker and far more complex, dealing with loyalty, honour, obligation, destiny, desire, vengeance, violence, love, hate, and trust; it doesn't sell-out with a sappy, happy ending, closing instead with Michael embracing the lifestyle that he once sought to avoid. Perfectamundo (that's Italian for 'perfect'. Possibly).In short, The Godfather is the don in every department."
Boba_Fett1138,"Oct 4, 2009",10/10,"""The Godfather"" is a movie that tops many list as the greatest movie ever made. It also tops some list concerning the greatest and most memorable movie lines and the movie it's characters and performances from its actors have also received lots of acclaim throughout the years. And yes, the movie is truly deserving all of the praise that is receiving from everywhere and everyone.Even though in my opinion part II is an even better movie, this is still the movie that began it all. Without this movie there of course would had never been a second one and this movie beautifully laid down the foundations for the even greater masterpiece that part II was, even though it's missing the presence of the great Marlon Brando in it.The movie is a greatly epic one, not in the least due to it's amazing running time of 175 minutes. But despite it's very long running time it really is not a movie that ever bores, even not at moments when not a lot is happening in the story. There always is something great or intriguing happening.But the movie is also really epic in many more different ways. It's like an operatic drama about a large Italian mafia family, located in New York. The movie features really a lot of characters in it and therefore also some different plot lines and dramatic developments but the movie does an amazing job with its story and the diversity of it. It binds it all beautifully together and even though the movie does take some big leaps in time and gets located at different locations throughout the world, throughout the entire movie, the movie always keeps flowing very well with a real steady pace.The family and basically all of the character have to go through some great ordeals. This means that characters keep developing throughout the entire, which is most notable with the Al Pacino character. His character goes through a great transformation, from being a polite, quite and perhaps also soft guy, to a tough and commanding crime boss, who doesn't back off for violence or any killings.In its essence it's a movie about tight bond of a family and what it means to stay loyal and stick together through tough times. Even though you know that all of these people are big criminals and even killers, the movie at all times keeps giving them a very human face by showing what makes them tick and it also isn't afraid to show the character emotions.It's of course also thanks to the many great characters of the movie that the characters develop so well and work out on basically every level. It features a still quite young Al Pacino in his break through role and the already more experienced and better known actors James Caan and James Caan, among many others, in important supporting roles. But it is of course Marlon Brando who gives the movie its most body. He plays one of the most memorable movie characters of all time and it was also basically this movie that made him immortal as an actor. The movie only won 3 Oscars but it's no big surprise that one of those 3 went to Brando, who himself of course refused to accept it and instead let faked Indian Sacheen Littlefeather pick it up, as a sign of protest against the treatment of native Americans. The other two Oscar's that the movie won were for best motion picture and best writing.It deserved to win way more of course and the movie was also nominated for 7 more (not counting in the withdrawn nomination for best music). But one of the Oscar's the movie really deserved to win was for a category it wasn't even nominated in. I was surprised how great the cinematography of the movie was and it truly deserves some more credit. The movie often picks some long shots, in which it isn't always showing a lot. The movie often chooses to show a minimum of things and only chooses to show what the characters also see, so we get more close to the characters and their feelings and thoughts. Truly some effective cinematography throughout, though Francis Ford Coppola directing also needs to take lots of credit for that.Simply THE crime epic of the 20th century.10/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
sanadalsalt,"Dec 25, 2025",6/10,"Watching The Godfather for the first time feels less like discovering a movie and more like sitting an exam you've been prepped for your whole life. Everyone, everywhere, has already told you it's ""the greatest film ever made,"" pop culture has spoiled half the moments, and the parodies make you feel like you've somehow already seen it. So yeah, going in with an open mind is basically a myth.And here's the hot take that apparently puts you in witness protection: The Godfather is... good. Just good. Not life-changing. Not cinema's holy grail. Just a solid, competently made movie that you're glad you finally watched so people stop looking at you like you've committed a crime against film history.To be fair, the mob world feels authentic, and the post-war atmosphere is done well. The opening wedding scene makes its point loud and clear. Don Corleone never stops working, even at his daughter's wedding. Message received. Loudly. Repeatedly. Maybe just a few minutes longer than strictly necessary.Now let's talk performances, because this is where the legend status gets spicy. Marlon Brando's Don Corleone is iconic, sure, but also kind of... cartoonish. The voice. The mannerisms. The aura of ""serious acting happening here."" Oscar-winning? Technically yes. Best performance in the movie? Not even close. He doesn't even feel like the main character half the time.That honor easily goes to Al Pacino. As Michael Corleone, he's actually interesting. Watching him evolve from ""I want nothing to do with this family"" war hero into a full-blown crime boss is the real backbone of the film. His transformation is subtle, smart, and genuinely compelling, which makes everyone else feel like they're orbiting around him.So no, The Godfather isn't bad. It's watchable. It's engaging. It's influential. It's just not untouchable. You've probably seen better movies, even if you're not allowed to say that out loud. Call it a classic if you want, but calling it the greatest movie ever made might be doing just a little too much."
TxMike,"Dec 12, 2004",N/A,"I was fortunate to see ""The Godfather"" back in 1972 upon its theatrical release. No matter how many ""gangster"" movies were made before this, here we had a different kind of movie. We had a movie foremost about ""family"" and dedication to one another. If you could manage to ignore the fact that this was one of the New York mafia families (set in the 1940s), it was as if we were watching a model family. At once honoring the family patriarch, Don Vito Corleone memorably played by Marlon Brando , and at the same time witnessing the rise of the new family leader, Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino. Equally memorable was the role of Santino 'Sonny' Corleone created by James Caan. And memorable for Robert Duvall who created the quiet role of Tom Hagen. Many list have ""The Godfather"" as number one of all time. To me that doesn't matter, films are meant to be enjoyed each for its own merit. Regardless, there probably will never be a ""gang family"" movie that approaches the overall impact of this one.Coppola directed this movie and its follow-ups. Not all of his have been great efforts. For me ""One From The Heart"", shot entirely on a sound stage, looks and sounds cheap, I consider it a failure. But he also directed such a fun movie as ""Peggy Sue Got Married"", another ""family"" theme. Al Pacino, even though he was 31 during filming, was still essentially an unknown, but his role as Michael put him on the map, and he is still going strong. ""The Godfather"" is a long movie at three hours, but it never seems long, so well told is its story. It is a classic in every respect, and a copy belongs in the library of every serious movie fan.Plus I will resist the urge to mention that there is a topless scene at exactly 1:52 into the BluRay version of Italian actress Simonetta Stefanelli who was only 17 when this was filmed in 1971.NOV 2025: I re-watched this movie on the 50th anniversary BluRay edition in 2022 from my public library. No extras but the picture and sound are great. Most of it was fresh, the only scene I really remembered was the horse head in bed with the movie producer."

This movie was so sloooooooooow, and the story just draaaaaaaaaaaags on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on and on. It was a torture, and at the end, I wondered: WHAT WAS THE POINT OF THIS MESS OF A MOVIE? It seemed like it was also going to tell us the story of Michael's sons, grandsons, great grandsons,  great great grandsons, and well.... it just seemed endless. ENDLESS. I wondered why IMDb users praise it so much if every single person that I know despises this movie. It's beyond dull. At the end, somehow Michael got rid of ALL of his enemies, in 2 minutes? Just that simple? He should have made that before, and he would have kept me from suffering this dreck. After watching this, I never want to watch one of those called ""classics"" (like Citizen Kane, Casablanca, Schindler´s list, Gone with the Wind, etc.) because it seems to ba a rule that a movie can´t be artistic and entertaining. Few movies combine those things. Those are the true classics. One example? Pulp Fiction. That movie is perfect in every possible way.I'll rate this movie a 3. I don't give it a one just because Marlon Brando was great. By the way, Al Pacino sucked in this movie. He couldn't have been more inexpressive."

TheOriginalCinephile,"Apr 1, 2019",10/10,"02/04/2019The Godfather (1972)Director - Francis Ford CoppolaCast - Marlon Brando & Al PacinoBased on the Classic novel 'The Godfather' by Mario Puzo, this movie is a resounding masterpiece in the field of arts & entertainment.
So what makes it the greatest movie ever made.
Is it the background score that stirs your soul every time it plays.
Is it the detailed direction by the master Coppola that not only takes you through the character's journey or the timeline but also helps you unravel deep rooted mysteries of the human psyche.
Is it the alluring cinematography by Gordon Willis that makes every frame in the movie look like the most fascinating visual a human eye can ever stand witness to.
Or is it the Masterclass in Acting given by a Brando as the iconic DON Vito Corleone & furthermore an even better performance by Al Pacino in not only the best role of his acting career, but also the most iconic character ever created on celluloid as Michael Corleone.
I guess this is the problem with this film, that all the creative geniuses in the field of Arts & Entertainment got their A game on & filled it with so much of class, passion, performance & excellence, that the film did not have an option but to be the best film in the world of cinema."
oneblip,"Sep 30, 2006",9/10,"I bought The Godfather: The Game and was sucked so deeply into it that I wanted to see the movies. My brother kept telling me about how the scenes in the movie played out and that alone was enough to make me buy the entire collection on DVD. I will never regret that decision so long as I live.The Godfather plays out like a documentary with out the corny voice over. The actors in this movie do such a great job it feels as though you aren't watching a movie but are instead watching the individual lives play out. There isn't a plot that can be fingered out. If you had to it would be the war between all the families and the cause of it.Don Vito Corleone is approached by a member of the Tattaglia family to form a deal between the two families in a new business venture: the selling of drugs. Don Corleone, a vigilant believer in the old ways, feels that getting into the business of drugs will draw too much heat. And because of this he refuses the offer that is placed before him.This fuels a fire with the Tattaglia family and it has a domino effect that causes wars between all of the families. The movie revolves around this central premise and comes to a head with the ending of the war. The outcome and what ends the war is also unpredictable and full of strategic writing. And I feel that the ending will surprise any body who doesn't already know how it all does.The only reason I didn't give this movie a 10/10 is because although it is a very entertaining and among the best movies I've ever seen, I don't feel that it is THEE best. There are movies out there that will entertain all audiences and that are just as good. There are movies that I can watch with friends without them growing bored. It gets a 9 because, as much as I love this movie, I can admit that it will only entertain a certain kind of person. I know there are movies that don't have this restriction.A definite must buy for collectors; Make sure you like dramatic movies and not action movies though."

aliciadipesto,"Sep 5, 2005",4/10,"Time and time again my friends berate me for not seeing this film and yet consider me to be something of a 'movie buff'. So they duly sat me down on Saturday night with a curry and the director's cut for my entertainment and delight.All I can say is, there's 3 hours of my life I'm never going to get back. Don't get me wrong; I'm a big fan of gangster movies, I've studied some of the early Cagney/Robinson films and seen most of the more important ones: Scarface, Casino, Goodfellas - I even stayed awake through Once Upon A Time In America. But The Godfather was agonising. Slow, meandering, overly-complicated, lacking punch - what it lashed out in bullets and horses heads, it certainly lacked in dynamite. Watching The Godfather is the cinematic equivalent of the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds; 30 years on it's impossible to see why on earth it was considered so ground-breakingly new and exciting. But by all accounts Coppolla was making a brave movie here, reintroducing a genre stuck in the 1920's and lavishing 168 minutes on the minutiae of one Mafia family.And lavish it he does. The only thing I can say in its defence is that the production design was superb, it lacked for nothing, the overall look of the film was excellent. The budget must have been colossal. What a pity the plot and the dialogue didn't live up to its promise. With a cast so huge and impressive as well, it's twice as pitiful.The legendary Marlon Brando couldn't fail to disappoint - the poor man's legend - in my opinion - far exceeded his talent. I understand the director begged Brando to come out of retirement for this, although I kind of wish he'd stayed there. His incessant mumbling, padded cheeks and all, peering out of dark corners and scratching his face just had me turning the volume way up high and becoming increasingly frustrated. Diane Keaton just played Diane Keaton/Annie Hall (her real name, trivia hounds)as usual, with an increasingly terrible haircut. She looked like she wasn't sure what she was doing in the movie any more than we did, she just looked like she wanted to go home. Her relationship with Pacino totally lacked chemistry and I found his return to her from Sicily as a widower highly unbelievable. Even Pacino's 'thunderbolt' relationship with Apollonia seemed contrived and wooden - I know he's meant to be a hard man but he remained so poker-faced throughout the movie I lost any feelings of sympathy for him.The best part I felt was played by James Caan, whose character was labelled as 'hot tempered' by his father (is that what it takes to be interesting within the Corleone family?!) so of course he met a predictably sticky end like a lot of the better characters. I found a lot of the meandering plot very predictable - to the extent where I was annoying my die-hard fans who put on the show for me, but I couldn't help it: ""Something tells me Apollonia isn't going to get out of that car"" etc. The plot didn't really go anywhere, it just seemed to be setting itself up for that sequel; every 20 minutes or so Brando/Pacino were inviting people to take advantage of 'an offer they couldn't refuse'. It was laughable.Other than Caan's, none of the characters were the slightest bit appealing; the outrageous behaviour of Tommy in Scorsese's Goodfellas, for example, is counterbalanced by his likable personality: you're laughing in spite of yourself. Pacino's protagonist in Scarface is the same - snorting copious amounts of cocaine and waving a gun around - you still care about the guy, however monstrous he's become. But Pacino in The Godfather was just a cartoon bad-ass, like the rest of them, identikit baddies with no depth whatsoever, no remorse, no weakness, no humanity, no growth. When Brando stumbles to his death among the tomato plants in play with his grandson I take that to mean that Coppolla was showing us Vito had a heart but really, it was too little too late.Coppolla may well have been brave in 1972 to reintroduce a decidedly unfashionable genre on a conservative audience, and for the time it might have been a breath of fresh air, but the glamour and pace of subsequent, better, gangster fare puts The Godfather in the shade, however responsible the film may be for the genre's future output."
emperor_bender,"Feb 26, 2008",10/10,"This movie was everything a good movie should be. I got The Godfather box set last Christmas (I had already watched the series about 20 times by then) and I watched it honestly about 3 weeks straight after getting it. This movie however is hands-down my favorite of the series. The story was amazing, and sure made Mafia life look like paradise. I loved the characters, all of them, even the antagonists were unforgettable. Everything looked authentic 1940's style, there weren't any slip-ups as far as I can tell. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall, John Cazale all make a very authentic looking, and truly remarkable family. I was a huge Godfather encyclopedia for a while, I knew 95% of the characters and everything, and its easy to see why, this is a very memorable movie in every aspect. I loved this film at first sight. I read some of the ""Hated it"" comments, and they all say its boring or something. Those people need to grow up, if you want an action movie watch Die Hard or something, this movie is a classic and if those people lack the taste for good movies to watch it they need to take their hate of it elsewhere. This is a perfect movie and deserves a 10/10. Watch this if you want a truly unforgettable experience."
Prismark10,"Oct 14, 2019",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola got Mario Puzo's pulpy novel and turned it into a cinematic masterpiece with Puzo as co-scriptwriter. Robert McKee famous for his seminars on script writing offers Casablanca as the perfect film. He deconstructs the script and movie in his seminars. He is wrong. The Godfather is as perfect as a movie you can get.When Paramount Pictures gave the movie a greenlight. The mafia families were concerned that it would lift the lid on how they operated and shine an unwelcome spotlight on the crime bosses. There were attempts to stop the movie being made. They had nothing to worry about, when the movie came out the mob bosses realized that no amount of money could buy the public relations they got from the film.Instead of murderous gangsters. The Godfather portrays the mafia as men of honour, family men who value loyalty and live by a code. Violence would only be used as a last resort. It is because we never see the outside victims of these people. The story is set within gangsters and their families and associates.The film opens with an epic wedding sequence set after the war. On the day of his daughter's wedding Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) cannot refuse a request made of him. His godson Johnny Fontane drops by to sing at the wedding and requests Don Vito's help to secure a part in a movie that would secure his comeback. His informally adopted son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall) is sent to Hollywood to persuade the film producer and when he refuses, the producer wakes up in bed with the head of his prized horse.Don Vito Corleone is a criminal, the head of the five families. He is also the moral centre of this movie. He is wise, he can be kind but he is also ageing and his values are of a world that is disappearing. Don Vito's reluctance to enter the drugs trade would be his undoing.The Godfather is really the story of youngest son, Michael Corleone (Al Pacino.) The war hero who wanted to have nothing to do with the family business but is pulled in first when his father is shot and then when a further attempt is made on his life in the hospital. After the death of his hot headed brother Sonny Corleone (James Caan.) Michael is groomed by Don Vito to become the head of the family. After his father's death, Michael plans revenge on those who betrayed his family and the rival families.In his first scenes at the family wedding, Michael explains to his girlfriend Kay Adams (Diane Keaton) the various heavies hanging around and some of the things his father did to pull favours. Michael is an outsider in his own family as he tells Kay that he is not like them. As the film progresses Michael becomes exactly like them.The Godfather has terrific performances. Marlon Brando won his second Best Actor Oscar and rejuvenated his career. On the other hand Al Pacino, Robert Duvall and James Caan were all nominated for the best supporting actor Oscars and cancelled each other out. The film won three Oscars including Best Picture. The big winner that year was actually Cabaret with eight Oscar wins including Best Director.So much of The Godfather has been emulated since. Michael Cimino was so enamoured by the movie, he opens The Deer Hunter with an epic wedding sequence to set up his story. He also cast Robert De Niro and John Cazale, two actors who appeared in The Godfather films. On the other hand Coppola would later cast John Savage who plays an important role in The Deer Hunter in The Godfather III in 1990.Then there is the climax. The christening scenes where Michael Corleone renounces the devil and all his work which is intercut with his various henchmen killing the Corleone's rivals. A trick Coppola has used in his other movies."
gab-14712,"Oct 18, 2017",9/10,"When I first saw The Godfather many years ago, I initially called the film ""a long, boring piece of crap."" Luckily as I have matured, so have my tastes in cinema. This film is heralded as an American classic, and now I can wholeheartedly agree with that sentiment. As famed critic Roger Ebert pointed out, this movie is the one where most people can agree on its quality.Ultimately, The Godfather is still a very long movie but I have come to appreciate it more with each viewing. The film is obviously about the mafia, but this is a different kind of mafia film. Prior mafia films and even those after this one deals with perspectives from an outsider and their perceptions of violence and death with the mafia. However, this film is told within the confinements of a mafia family. The story is told within the inside and that was a unique story angle at that time. I like how the film doesn't show corruption from the mafia family, the Corleones. There are no civilian casualties from organized crime and the only corrupt person in the film is in the form of a police officer. Don Corleone doesn't believe in dealing with drugs, because of how they affect people. The themes of the Corleone family and the movie itself is family and loyalty. As Michael Corleone points out in the movie, ""never take sides against the family."" That is when crazy things begin to happen.The beginning of the movie is very crucial. It is basically a large wedding scene with scenes intercut of Don Corleone in his darkened office taking care of family business. This beginning is important for several reasons. We get the tone of the film and we understand who the Corleone family is. This is also where all the characters are introduced and explained. By the time the scene is over, we get the big picture of the film and we get a sense where the film is heading. The scene is a bit long, but I felt director Francis Ford Coppola did an excellent job on introducing all of his main characters in the filmThis is a film about family and it takes advantage of the classic structure of handing power between generations. The patriarch of the family is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) who is the head of one of the most powerful mafia families. His children, who play a huge factor in the family, are Sonny (James Caan), Michael (Al Pacino), Connie (Talia Shire), and Fredo (John Cazale). Also playing a huge role is the family lawyer, Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall). The aging Vito decides to transfer power to one of his subalterns, and that causes a ripple between the five Mafia families in New York. The main child here is Michael, who didn't want anything to do with his family and instead join the military. But after Vito is shot, Mike decides to join the family business and take control.The acting is absolutely fantastic. Marlon Brando delivered one of the best performances of his career as the aging head of the family. He is known for using his devices in the beginning such as his puffy cheeks and the cat on his lap. The way he delivered his dialogue in such a soft-spoken voice is also very memorable. Al Pacino does a very good job, taking wise advice from his father while delivering on his own counsel. This is the beginning for Pacino's illustrious career. Robert Duvall does a fantastic job as Hagen. Duvall has had a legendary career, but the one role I think of every time I reflect on his career is his role as Tom Hagen. James Caan does a great job as the quick-tempered Sonny.The one thing that does irk me about the film is the use of women. It seems like women has no part of the family. Mike's sister, Connie (played solidly by Talia Shire) is only used for a target of her husband's Carlo anger. He treats her like a piece of filth. Although, Mike does have a special place in his heart for Connie. Mike also has a romantic interest in the film named Kay Adams (played by the eccentric Diane Keaton). I didn't think Kay was a strong character in the film. Also, Vito has a wife but she is just an insignificant shadow only meant for the family pictures. Finally, there is a Sicilian woman we meet. After Michael goes on exile in Sicily for shooting a cop who played a role in the shooting of his father, he falls in love with this girl..but she ends up getting blown up. My only qualm abut the film is how little importance women play in it.Also playing a huge role in the film is the music. Coppola traveled to Italy to find a composer who can bring an Italian feeling to the film. His find, Nino Rota did just that. The main title is heavily influenced by Italian culture and it gave an authentic feeling to the film-as the main characters are an Italian family. It's a shame that the Academy snubbed his music, because I felt it should have won an Oscar. It's one of my favorite all-time scores.Nominated for 11 Oscars and winning 3 of them including Best Picture, The Godfather is one of America's most influential films. The movie remains popular to this day and if you haven't seen the film, you should see it. It's almost three hours long, but this is a portrait of a mafia family that is all about family. Francis Ford Coppola did an amazing job directing this film from the very popular novel written by Mario Puzo. The Godfather is an instant American classic.My Grade: A-"
sh_ayush15,"Nov 14, 2015",10/10,"This movie is directed wonderfully. Dialogs are good. You don't even know how 3 hours are passed away. Al Pacino's acting takes movie to whole another level. The good news is that The Godfather has many amazing qualities, including fantastic performances, unprecedented visuals and very engaging stories. The bad news is that this should have easily been a 10, but overall, it is so sprawling and unfocused that I can't possibly give it more than a 9, which it only earns because the assets transcend what's basically a mess overall.Although all of the cinematography and production design is great, what really impressed me were some of the darkly lit scenes. Characters and features of sets emerge from pitch-blackness, and everything is rich, deep shades of burgundy, brown, and orange. Amazingly, nothing gets lost in these scenes."
clarahevia9,"Feb 3, 2015",10/10,"It's hard to find a moment in the film that isn't great. The Godfather lives up to the term masterpiece. A defining film in the history of cinema, ""The Godfather"" introduced a legendary filmmaker and several acting greats in the telling of an Italian American dynasty undone by the tragic circumstances of their criminal exploits. ""The Godfather"" is highly regarded as the greatest American movie of all-time. No other movie has garnered such praise as this movie has. Undoubtedly, everything has been meticulously put together to create an entertaining, captivating, and phenomenal masterpiece. Starring the best actor of all times (this movie can prove it), Marlon Brando, the rebellious prodigy, who electrified a generation and forever transformed the art of screen acting.You can't miss this movie."
davidburrows89,"Sep 23, 2013",7/10,"Marlon Brando's acting as the Godfather is sublime and this film is worth watching for that.However I did find the film very long-winded and at times boring. I liked the slow progression of the storyline and understand why Francis Ford Coppola did the film in the way he did. It's just that I felt the film was lacking something. It could have done with a bit more excitement or suspense to make the film more gripping.Lets just say I watched this film about a year ago and I still haven't seen The Godfather 2, and I am in no hurry to either.7/10. Average film. Worth watching to say that you have seen it."
GC-GiORGi,"Feb 2, 2016",N/A,"It's impressive movie that I have ever seen, I love Story of Corleone family so much! Every people can learn something from this movie.The cinematography of The Godfather is dark and tasteful, and colors are used perfectly to give a true feel of the era it is set in. There is a fair amount of violence, though rarely gratuitous.The Godfather certainly doesn't need my recommendation. The film is universally considered one of the best of all time, and the performances by Pacino and Brando alone is the stuff of legends.This movie is strong, good script, great casting, excellent acting, and over the top directing. It is hard to fine a movie done this well, it is 29 years old and has aged well. Even if the viewer does not like mafia type of movies, he or she will watch the entire film, the audiences is glued to what will happen next as the film progresses. Its about, family, loyalty, greed, relationships, and real life. This is a great mix, and the artistic style make the film memorable.This is the GREATEST MOVIE of the 20th century."

JackHodges-13503,"Jan 16, 2025",10/10,"The Godfather is not just a film; it's an immersive experience into the heart of family, power, and loyalty. Directed by Francis Ford Coppola, this 1972 masterpiece has stood the test of time, remaining as relevant today as when it first hit cinemas. What's striking is its balance of grandeur and intimacy-there's an almost operatic scale to its portrayal of the Mafia, yet at its core, it's about family dynamics and the personal costs of power. Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is nothing short of iconic, his presence a masterclass in subtlety and gravitas. The film's dialogue is steeped in a quiet menace, with memorable lines that have become part of the cultural lexicon. Its pacing and cinematography are flawless, drawing the viewer into its world with an atmosphere of inevitable tragedy. The Godfather isn't just a film to watch-it's one to live and breathe."

sausagebrigade,"Jul 31, 2003",5/10,"The Godfather is arguably the most over-rated movie ever made. To be fair it is a technical feast, with impressive period design, and the music is memorable, but nothing else is. Pacino is dull, Keaton is forgettable, Duvall goes through the motions, and the script lacks the punch it probably had in 1972. Goodfellas, in one movie, tells the same rise and fall story that The Godfather has over three movies in a far more enjoyable and vivid way."
divyanshukashyap-75334,"Dec 13, 2021",10/10,"The Godfather is truly the godfather of movies. Whether its the acting, the music, the cast, screenplay...everything is spot on and credit to Francis Ford Coppola for not only directing this but also choosing to stick with a new comer like Al Pacino where as the production wanted a household name, casting Brando and setting the story in New York despite being nearly fired on 3-4 occasions. And boy did it pay off, They would go on to earn their own Oscar nominations and wins for ""The Godfather.""
The movie is.3 hours long & slow paced but still there is no dull moment in the movie. A treat for movie lovers with legends of cinema."

everyday-04719,"Jun 20, 2024",9/10,"I LIKE IT. A flawless movie. This movie translates from the book perfectly! This movie made me want to be a director and create film. Everyone's acting was perfect. To think that Puza wrote this specifically to make a hit is at first crazy.From the aspects that have been reviewed, the author states that the film The Godfather truly deserves to be the king of mafia-themed films. The plot is neat and the storyline is not boring. The acting quality of the actors and actresses is not half-hearted. The use of props is also total (that horse's head, you know!) and also music that suits the theme being carried. If The Shawshank Redemption had never existed, perhaps the one that would be in first place right now would be this film. Two thumbs don't seem to be enough to appreciate the masterpiece of director Francis and also Mario Puzo as the author of the novel. Salute!"
joshgst,"Sep 30, 2015",10/10,"This was truly a history rival and fascinating piece of cinematography. The godfather was one of my favorite and classical films from a he series. Its involves mystery, action, crime, food and the mafia some of my favorite subjects for a good film. I particularly like the entire Godfather Trilogy but personally the first one is my absolute favorite. The scene where everyone has dinner and the party shows how caring and loving the family. Also when all the families meet together to discuss the ""buisness of the mafia was awesome. Then all of sonny dramatic scenes were just hilariously funny but it was sad yet obvious sonny temper was get him into trouble one day. Then when Michael took over I could see he reflected his father a lot"
filmnyc-165-275026,"Sep 30, 2015",10/10,"The Godfather is not only a great Noir style gangster movie but also a tale of the immigrants that came to this country in the last part of the 1800's through the depression. Poor families from Europe that came to the land of the free only to find that all the wealth was controlled by the land barons, Bankers and well to do. Like Most parents Vito Corleone did what he had to do to raise his family and never wanted this life for his sons. Realizing his words were lost on Sonny and Fredo who was a sickly child did not have much hope of making it on his own. But Michael was different he went to college then into the service in WW2. He was never supposed to be in that world but the attempt on his fathers life makes him realize he is his fathers son. He swears revenge on Salatso and the police captain that protects him and so the story unravels. Great performances By Brando, Caan, Pacino,Duvall,with an incredible supporting cast with Abe Vigoda,Richard Castalano, Diane Keaton and Talia SHire. Perhaps the best of the supporting cast is John Cazale as Fredo Supposedly not the brightest bulb in the bunch turns out to be a very good schemer who wants whats coming to him."
Xstal,"Sep 9, 2022",7/10,"It's a tale of contempt and corruption, extortion and fraud and disruption, the dinosaurs roam, testosterone foams, below the streets, where the sewers and the rats run.The overwhelmingly brilliant performance comes from Marlon Brando, the rest of the cast essentially play themselves or a role they perpetually play, just watch any and all of their subsequent offerings.Does it work as well today? I'm not sure it survives the test of time as well as other films of the era or before, some of the editing jumps about erratically and women are generally treated like brood mares who live in ignorance of their surroundings - just as long as there's a good sing song, a dance, and a cake, at a christening or wedding even better.I fondly remember Edward G. Robinson films being better than this, Jimmy Cagney even, George Raft was the best mob villain by a country mile."
invisibleunicornninja,"Dec 16, 2018",4/10,How is this considered to be one of the greatest movies of all time? Does something amazing happen in the third act? I wouldn't know because I only got around an hour and a half into this absolute slog of a movie. This thing is so impossibly overlong and boring that I'm pretty sure that most of these 10/10 reviews are fakes. Or at least from people who have never seen any movies other than this one.
lloyd00,"Aug 30, 2015",10/10,"This film represents the absolute perfection, either in cinematography or acting. The perfects book's perfect adaptation. The only minor ""problem"" is that this and the Part II are complete each other, one by one these movies are less, but this little detail won't minor their merits. In the lead role Al Pacino was the best choice, and don't forget to mention the legend, Marlon Brando as THE Godfather. I think this film represents what nowadays movie are lack of. In this movie the story and the characters are the main parts not the visual effects. In my opinion to this very day, this was Coppola's best directing. And don't forget Nino Rota's melodies which are inseparable from the movie."
sme_no_densetsu,"Oct 5, 2010",9/10,"""The Godfather"" has long enjoyed a reputation as one of the greatest films of all time. Is that a fair assessment? After re-watching the film recently, I'd say yes.The 'godfather' of the title is Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando), the aging head of the Corleone crime family. His time is coming to an end and some of his rivals would like to precipitate that end. When an attempt is made on the Don's life his sons follow in their father's footsteps as they seek to silence their enemies and protect the family interests.The Oscar-winning script was co-written by director Francis Ford Coppola and Mario Puzo, the author of the original novel. While trimmed significantly from the novel the film still clocks in at two hours and forty-five minutes. The film progresses at a stately pace and features countless classic scenes.Coppola's direction received a well-deserved Oscar nomination and so did Nino Rota's score (at least until it was deemed ineligible). Gordon Willis' cinematography is good (but not great) and the film's evocation of the 40's & 50's is both attractive and authentic.As for the actors, Marlon Brando was rewarded with his second Best Actor Oscar for his iconic portrayal of Vito Corleone. Al Pacino was nearly as good in his role as Vito's youngest son but he had to settle for a nomination in the supporting category. He had good company, though, since James Caan and Robert Duvall were also nominated. Any one of these three performances would have been Oscar-worthy. There were also several memorable performances in smaller roles from the likes of John Cazale, Talia Shire, Sterling Hayden and others.Is ""The Godfather"" the best American film of all time? Personally, I don't think so but I wouldn't rank it too far from the top. In any case, this is one of those films that every movie lover should see."
evanbenlian,"Dec 14, 2015",10/10,"The Godfather movie series is the best that I have ever seen. It's really joy and fun and exciting to watch the movie all over again. I really enjoy the first part the most, but I think the second part is very interesting and adds lots of elements to part one. I wish the Godfather was a whole new TV series, that dose extend beyond three parts. I enjoy the excellent acting, story, and drama. I can't say enough about the music. It's something that many people enjoy listening to on regular bases. Overall I would rank this movie top notch on my list. Highly recommended. have seen The Godfather movies too many times to count. It's part of the lexicon in my family, we quote lines from it all the time in regular conversation. So, I thought this book might be a little boring, just because I already knew the story so well. Not the case! The book adds so much detail to the story that I think I'll be watching the movie again soon in a whole new light. Joe Mantegna does such a wonderful job narrating this story and I'd absolutely recommend his version as opposed to the other full cast version that's out there, especially for people that are really in tune with the movie."
brefane,"Nov 26, 2009",6/10,"Take a gangster film, dip it in sepia tones, wrap it in Nino Rota's elegiac score, add soap and sentiment, and you've got The Godfather, the ""Gone with the Wind"" of gangster films. And like GWTW, The Godfather represents old-style Hollywood film-making at its most popular, but it's no masterpiece, and Goodfellas and The Sopranos make it seem almost antiquated. Coppola's direction attempts to be sweeping, but the script and the characters are shallow and predictable. Scaled to be epic, the film is slow moving and talky with several characters and sequences that feel dispensable. The film doesn't really deepen or build excitement as it progresses, and despite all the talk about family, the members of the Corleone family are essentially stock characters. Pacino, Shire, Cazales, and Caan don't bond as a family, the patriarch is not a commanding or even likable figure who would inspire love or loyalty and Morgana King as mama barely exists. Though it netted an Oscar, Brando's largely immobile performance is gimmicky, and really a supporting role in terms of screen time. The Godfather is the story of Michael Corleone, and the film is owned by a brilliant Al Pacino. In support, Caan, Keaton and Duvall are pretty much one-note. The Godfather is an acknowledged film classic that became a cultural touchstone which inspired imitations and parodies;it was a media event and a box office phenomenon that swept the Oscars and Brando's sending Sasheen Littlefeather to refuse his Oscar only added to it's legend."
sullymazda,"Jan 8, 2015",3/10,"OK, I see that the movie has many naysayers. I was one of them when I saw the film in 1972, and I was only fifteen at the time. I could go on and on about the film's myriad failures. It is contrived, self-important, at times even poorly staged. Which brings me to my point. A lot of people seem to forget that Coppola did not win Best Director-- Bob Fosse (for ""Cabaret') did, and deservedly so. He did a much better job. That is one of the eight Oscars that ""Cabaret"" won.The other seven just happen to be Art Direction, Cinematography, Sound, Editing,Original Score, Best Supporting Actor, and Best Actress. So when the time came to open the envelope and announce Best Picture, the Award goes instead to a film that, by that point, had won only two statues (for Actor and Adapted Screenplay). How does any movie win eight Academy Awards and fail to grab Best Picture? With that in mind, ""The Godfather"" is not merely arrogant film-making. Its history and legacy,both--just like its protagonists-- are just downright larcenous."
murtaza_mma,"Sep 29, 2008",10/10,"The Godfather is an extravaganza, nigh flawless, a cinematic magnum opus, ubiquitously acclaimed for its brilliance and for being in a league of its own. The Godfather doesn't depict poetic justice but rather portrays the triumph of perspicacious potency over abject vulnerability. The Godfather is known, not for its cogency but for its eloquence.The movie being star-studded is decorated with a plethora of supernal performances and it won't be a hyperbole that almost every actor gave an Oscar worthy performance. Marlon Brando is exceptionally brilliant in his sterling portrayal of Vito Corleone and so is Al Pacino in his remarkable portrayal of Michael Corleone. The grandeur of Don Vito Corleone ironically lies in his austerity and inexorable equanimity.The grandiosity of the movie is such, that even the biggest complement made about it may sound like a picayune remark. The Godfather may most aptly be described as an obituary of humanity, a requiem of mankind, owing to the pervasive violence and the brutality that it portrays in an utmost sanguinary fashion. In a nutshell, the movie has transcended all the limits of mortality only to achieve apotheosis.http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
eamon-hennedy,"Oct 28, 2003",10/10,"Undeniably one of the finest American motion pictures ever made, The Godfather is a magnificent film beginning what would be one of the finest trilogies and stories to grace the big screen. The Godfather is a pitch perfect film with many factors that mark it out as not only the best film of the 70's  but as one of the finest films ever made. The performances from all are superb, not one actor is out of place and they are given some of the finest dialog to work with. Brando is majestic as Vito and while his performance in this film may be the most famous as well as iconic it is Al Pacino who is undeniably the star. While his films nowadays usually consist of his chewing scenery with a blustering personality and dialog which he shouts, as Michael Corleone, the war hero of a son who is dragged into the family business when there is a hit attempt on his father, he is fantastic, his performance here one of the undisputed best of what is a golden era in Hollywood film making. The journey that the character goes on, from war hero with a loving girlfriend to the head of the 'family' is masterful. It is hard to believe that this was the actor who would go on to be so excessive in Scarface and The Devil's Advocate.Both Brando and Pacino are fantastically supported by a fine supporting cast. Robert Duvall, James Cann, John Cazale and Diane Keaton all put in superb work. The film contains some of the finest acting, writing and directing for a Hollywood film and many a moment that you cannot forget. The Horse's Head scene is one of the most disturbing yet brilliantly executed scenes that you will ever witness, the screenplay by Mario Puzo and Coppola is sublime and tells a wonderful story, while Coppola's direction is his best.  Finally, Nina Rota's music is without doubt one of the best music scores ever composed for a film. Going from waltz to terrifying orchestra in a matter of minutes, it is a music score that will stay with you forever.To sum up, The Godfather is sensational. A fine film from a fine filmmaker."
mullahk3,"Feb 4, 2006",10/10,"As an Films Studies student from London. Watching this film was one of the most exciting thrill that ever happened to me. The powerful use of script and the Cinematography used to shoot the scenes were perfect and powerful. The first sequence of the film grips the audiences attention that this is not about brutal murders or shooting people without reason but involves discipline and symbolises the role played by Vito Corleone as being like a senator or a president when people come to help. I have watched this film more than 20 times and still don't get bored of it. If you want to compare it with Citizen Cane or Scarface, you can't. Because its too artistic and a perfect film for a gangster/crime hybrid film. When Al Pacino's role changes the film creates more suspense and concern on how he would run the family, but everyone then believes in him and he then becomes the next Godfather.This film is one of the best film ever to be made. Perfect in the way it starts and subsequently the ending as well, if you haven't watch this film didn't understand the concept of it, then don't bother watching films. This is the best film ever to be made...10/10"

But before ""Jack"" there was ""The Godfather."" While I feel the whole ""Godfather"" trilogy has been lauded into oblivion and is somewhat overrated, who am I to argue with the majority? People think these are great movies, and they've certainly implanted themselves permanently in our cultural consciousness.And don't get me wrong: these films have moments of greatness (at least the first two installments do). But I think ""The Conversation"" and ""Apocalypse Now"" are ultimately more interesting films, and I think Coppola stretched himself more artistically in those two films than he did in the entire ""Godfather"" trilogy combined.Of the trilogy, the first film is by far the best. It shows Coppola's flair for being able to craft a story with extreme mainstream appeal while staying faithful to his artistic vision. ""The Godfather"" doesn't look or sound quite like any gangster film before it, with it's muddy lighting and sound. It's also much more ambiguous morally than the usual Hollywood gangster film, at least any produced up to that point. The line between crime and justice is blurred sometimes beyond distinction, and the Corleone family at times acts with more honor (in its own way) than the institutions charged with upholding freedom, justice and morality. In this way, ""The Godfather"" offered a scathing critique of the foundations on which America as a country was built.Coppola, however, drives this point into the ground over the course of three films. There's really not much more to say after the first film (it's already apparent that Michael Corleone's style of rule is different from his father's, his coldness and ruthlessness necessitated by a changing time), but we have to sit through a nearly 3 1/2 hour second installment that does nothing but reiterate this point again and again. Part II at least is saved by the back story of Vito Corleone (played by Marlon Brando in Part I and Robert De Niro in Part II), and that story alone keeps Part II afloat. But Part III is wholly unnecessary and mars the whole enterprise, turning the franchise into the stuff of parody and camp.Al Pacino is the glue that holds the trilogy together, though his character really isn't as complex as a first viewing would have you believe. The major conflict facing him is resolved in the first film, and the second and third films give him nothing to do but replay what are essentially the same scenes over and over again.Other standouts in the cast include Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Talia Shire (who alone makes the third chapter worth watching).Obviously a must see for cinema buffs, or even casual fans, but don't feel you have to label this trilogy as great just because of the reputation that precedes it.My Grade--- Part I: A Part II: B Part III: C-"
RM851222,"May 7, 2015",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.To call ""The Godfather"" a masterpiece or a classic would be underestimating. This is simply put, one of the very best (if not the best) motion pictures ever created. I saw this movie many times, and i never get tired of it. After some time passes, you kinda feel a need to revisit it again. Rewatching it recently on 4K UHD disk kinda blew me away the fact of how incredible it looks.There isn't anything new that i could say about this picture that wasn't said before countless times. Everything works here on such level, that it creates this rich, deep and unforgettable world. From whole trilogy, Part 1 is my favorite by a mile. 2nd and 3rd movies are great in their own terms, but first one is another level.Acting, directing, writing, music (the music!), set design - it's a thing of beauty and admiration to a movie crafting art.Overall, because you have probably already seen this masterpiece, I can only recommend it to not forget it for a long time and revisit it once in a while. It contains everything that a cinema-goer can wish. The unforgettable and one of the kind motion picture, which probably like a great wine just keeps getting better with years."
butchfilms,"Nov 6, 2008",10/10,"I am not saying anything new when I say that this is the best movie in the history of cinema (at least for most of the people). ""The godfather"" is a major film with a great plot, great performances and it is entertaining since its first moment until the last second. Most of us who have watched it know at least almost of memory some little phrase told by any of its characters.I am not a big fan of Marlon Brando (even thought I found him extraordinary in ""A Streetcar Named Desire (1951)"") but I recognize that he made the role of ""vito corleone"" one of the 5 most important characters in the history of cinema, nobody could have made this character better than him. Al Pacino became famous thanks to his performance as Michael Corleone in this film, where we can see his transformation from a nice guy to a cold mafia boss.I have watched this film like 10 times and each new time I watch it I like it more.The best movie ever"
Stud-12,"Aug 21, 1999",7/10,"Personally, I found this movie to be quite overrated. Even though it was a good movie, I see very little that makes it great. The movie is long, and often long winded. The only standout that I see is Brando's incredible acting. Mr. Brando and Al Pacino both make this long film bearable."
DJAkin,"May 5, 2006",10/10,"I loved this movie. I've seen it many times. I also bought the PS2 game which made me interested in it once again. I love all the characters especially Marlon Brando. He had a lot of good advice in this movie for those who refused his offers. Great one liners in this movie also. James Caan was a hot head and great at playing Sonny. Michael was great. What can you say about any aspect of this movie that is not great and flawless? The sets, language etc. are amazing. I watched this and Godfather 2 on the same week. I can't wait to see the new commentary by the director. I am so looking forward to it. How can you see a better movie? The horse head in the bed was amazing also."
hall895,"Jun 16, 2010",9/10,"Does it even need to be said that The Godfather is an amazing film? Is there really any purpose at all in pointing out all the things which make it so wonderful? Everybody knows. Everybody will always know. This is a film which will live forever. The story, the performances, the cinematography, the music...all so perfect. And all woven together so wonderfully by director Francis Ford Coppola who created a true classic.There are so very many good reasons why this film will always be remembered so fondly. No matter how many times you see it the film never fails to make an impact. Even if you've seen the film so often you essentially have it memorized line for line and shot for shot it remains a thrilling experience. From the famous opening scene with Marlon Brando's Don Vito Corleone receiving requests for favors on the occasion of his daughter's wedding all the way to the end and the final settling of all family business the film never lets up. It's an undeniably powerful story and one which retains the capacity to surprise. Because initially it seems obvious that the story is about Don Vito Corleone. He is the Godfather after all. But, for as powerful a presence as Brando is, as the story plays itself out there comes the moment where you realize this is the story of Don Vito's son Michael, as played so wonderfully by Al Pacino. When Michael comes into his own the film, gripping from the start, becomes even more compelling. Has any character in any film evolved more than Michael Corleone does here? The Michael we meet at his sister's wedding bears no resemblance to the man we see in the end. And what a performance by Pacino, changing along with his character. What a journey it is for Michael as his story unfolds. And it is quite a ride as well for us who have the privilege of seeing it.Brando and Pacino are the headliners but they are wonderfully supported by an amazing cast which includes the likes of James Caan, Robert Duvall, Diane Keaton and Al Lettieri. And that is just scratching the surface. There are so many memorable characters. And what a world Coppola has created for these characters to inhabit. The film has a unique look and feel to it. The world of The Godfather is quite unlike any other, often imitated but never duplicated. It's a triumph in every sense for Coppola. But perhaps his biggest success is in making you sympathize with the Corleones. We know right from the start that Don Vito Corleone is a man capable of doing monstrous things. But we identify with him anyway. And one cannot help but feel for Michael as he is inexorably pulled into the family business.Everyone has their favorite Godfather characters, favorite moments, favorite lines. The film has become a cultural touchstone. And as it continues to be discovered by new generations it seems that the film, if possible, actually continues to grow in stature. It is a classic film which stands the test of time. The Godfather has earned its place of honor in the history of film. A true masterpiece."
vampi1960,"Jul 30, 2006",10/10,"The godfather is one of those movies i never get tired of watching,its a classic Mob movie,Francis ford Coppola directed this gem with great acting by Marlon Brando,jimmy caan,AL pacino,Robert duvall,Diane Keaton, and john cazale.its a violent,gritty and realistic account of a mafia family with Marlon Brando as don corleone,the big boss.this classic is often imitated but never topped.the story was written by Mario puzo, from his best selling novel.it also stars;Talia shire,Gianni Russo, lee strasberg,john Marley,Alex rocco,and Marianna hill.its an extremely long,a little over 3 hours,best seen uncensored.it was followed by 2 sequels.part 2 was very good,part 3 not so good.as an Italian American i can appreciate the godfather.it is one of a kind.10 out of 10."

jimmycerf,"Sep 15, 2014",10/10,"The Godfather is an endless movie. No matter the age in which it has been discovered or the number of times you have seen it, this is a work that does not lose its ability to fascination and mystery. The problem is how to talk about it not limited to the amount of praise that his expertise justifies either the wonderful performance of Brando as Don Vito Corleone is evoked (note modulation of dialogues and play with the cat in the three interviews of the first sequence: all his character is defined), the tormented role Pacino as Michael Corleone (is a war hero who works they require to take their place in the crime family), the impulsive character of James Caan, with its counterpart in reflective Tom Hagen who plays Robert Duvall or accuracy of the smallest side, corresponding to names as Italian as Sollozzo and Tattaglia.The ribbon structure wise, it does not feel his nearly three hours, is also exemplary. It could be considered that The Godfather is organized around collective sequences religious-family: marriage of Connie (the only sunny sequence of the film to the Sicilian intermediate achieved), the justly celebrated baptism-slaughter, disease and death (the Don Vito was playing with his grandson among the vines, is another anthology moment) and the rest comes down to await the arrival of the violence, unrelenting brutality from the shooting of Sonny at the foot of the house (a tribute Coppola to Arthur Penn's Bonnie & Clyde) to the ""premiere"" of Michael in the restaurant. There riddled bodies, stabbed, dismembered, strangled or blunt: a kind of feast of degraded meat, without which there is no mafia ""order."""
izachzzz,"Sep 1, 2018",10/10,Great movie. This is the type of movie you just want to watch time and time again. A real classic.
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Jan 15, 2004",9/10,"I did get a little bored here and there. But this film is classic. A work of art that will be remembered forever, and I admire the acting. It's so wonderful and you see so many familular faces that you see today. I will never forget ""The Godfather"".9/10"
tomimt,"Feb 10, 2006",7/10,"So, the best movie ever? No. Not in my opinion, but I can see where the sayers get it. the Godfather was rather ground breaking film for it's time, a rather bold film, but still it's not the cinematic masterpiece everyone keeps raving about.Coppolas best film is ""Apocalypse, Now"". That is something that is extremely hard to top. When you compare the two the style of directing is so different, that they almost look like they were shot by two different directors.Godfather's biggest issue is poorly made editing, unnecessarily lengthened out scenes and totally unnecessary scenes, but then again what can you expect of a film, which was something, or so I've heard, that even the director was frustrated about. Some scenes just linger on the screen, without any evidence, that the director really knew what he wanted, and, in the end, the producers decided to amp it all in the film just because the material was there.The best thing about the film is acting. There's no way denying that. This is the film, which shows why people think Marlon Brando is one of the greatest actors of the history. This is the film that showed us the genius of Al Pacino.It's been some time since I've seen part 2, but I remember liking it better, I've always thought it was a vast improvement from the first one."
zachary_a_erickson-26701,"Feb 23, 2018",5/10,"This is over done and over rated. It sucks.It just doesn't make any sense why people like one crime film so much. There are so many good motion pictures out there, and out of all of them, people pick this one? Honestly Francis Ford Coppola is over rated, and he makes lots of trash films."
Al_The_Strange,"Jan 2, 2013",8/10,"This film has spawned so many gangster clichés and parodies that it's not even funny. Every time you've heard of people ""sleeping with da fishies"" or ""making an offer you can't refuse,"" it'll all boil back to this classic, highly-tutted film.On first glance, I dismissed the film as being rather dull, despite a few standout moments. On repeat viewings, I have found it more compelling. The film is most memorable for the scenes everybody knows and loves: the scene with the horse's head, the street fighting scene, Marlon Brando's mumbling, the restaurant shooting, sporadic bursts of gunfights and violence...it's all there. Dialogue dominates most of the film, but when given due attention, the story can be rather gripping and mesmerizing. At this point, the only drag I've felt is in the last thirty minutes or so; the film just kinda winds down after nearly 150 minutes of epic-scale gangster mayhem.The story is long, dense, and chock full of quality characterizations. The film does a fine job of keeping its events in order so that the politics of each situation makes some kind of sense. What matters the most will be the characters, who are endearing, and the underlying themes of family, honor, and loyalty. Family and generations are probably the most blatant themes, especially since most scenes show some strong contrast (or perhaps comparisons) between adults and children.As a film, it looks really classy. Photography never was a huge standout for these films, but the sepia tones and framing lends the movie a type of classic family-portrait appeal. Editing is decent. Acting is probably the biggest virtue here. Marlon Brando chews the scenery, despite his mumbling and constant fiddling with things, he does show endless nuance and expressions that brings Vito Corleone to life really well. Al Pacino must be at his most nuanced as Michael, and the rest of the magnificent cast fulfills their parts well. Writing is decent. This production has good-looking sets, props, and costumes, and is especially noteworthy for its period reproduction. Music is nice too.Everybody should see this at least once in their lifetime.4/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Good | Film: Perfect)"
HusseinAlwr,"Nov 26, 2015",10/10,"Rarely can it be said that a film has defined a genre, but never is that more true than in the case of The Godfather. Since the release of the 1972 epic (which garnered ten Academy Award nominations and was named Best Picture), all ""gangster movies"" have been judged by the standards of this one (unfair as the comparison may be). If a film is about Jewish mobsters, it's a ""Jewish Godfather""; if it's about the Chinese underworld, it's an ""Oriental Godfather""; if it takes place in contemporary times, it's a ""modern day Godfather"".If The Godfather was only about gun-toting Mafia types, it would never have garnered as many accolades. The characteristic that sets this film apart from so many of its predecessors and successors is its ability to weave the often-disparate layers of story into a cohesive whole. Any of the individual issues explored by The Godfather are strong enough to form the foundation of a movie. Here, however, bolstered by so many complimentary themes, each is given added resonance. The picture is a series of mini-climaxes, all building to the devastating, definitive conclusion.Rarely does a film tell as many diverse-yet-interconnected stories. Strong performances, solid directing, and a tightly-plotted script all contribute to The Godfather's success. This motion picture was not slapped together to satiate the appetite of the masses; it was carefully and painstakingly crafted. Every major character - and more than a few minor ones - is molded into a distinct, complex individual. Stereotypes did not influence Coppola's film, although certain ones were formed as a result of it."
MattBrady099,"Oct 10, 2014",10/10,"Don Vito Corleone: ""You talk about vengeance. Is vengeance going to bring your son back to you? Or my boy to me?"".The godfather to me is a bloody brilliant masterpiece of a film and people may say it is not they cup of tea and am okay with that but this movie changed the way that I thought of movies, the story is about a man called Don Vito Corleone who has this big family and big friends and all in the middle of all of that the family and friends don't know that he works with the gangsters, The acting is out of this world and the music is so chilling and moving with a gangster feel mixed with it, R.I.P. Marlon Brando you beautiful man your brilliant actor bring us a strong Character in the movie that you deserved more then one Oscar and this movie deserved more then 3 Oscars it deserved 10 Oscars that's how good to movie is."

bosoxfan7191,"Oct 29, 2005",10/10,"This is an excellent movie. It has great actors great scenes and a great storyline. There is only one complaint that I have about it, a lot of the material covered in the book is not in the movie. Without giving away too much of the story there are many ""books""(more like parts to the book) of the Godfather novel, such as the book II( focusing on Johnny Fontaine). Other than the exclusion of some parts that aren't focus on the main characters this is an extremely close adaptation of the novel( word for word in many sense epically near the begging of the movie). Al Pachino is at the top in this movie and steals the show, Brando is great also and Robert Duvol as Tom Hagen was wonderful.This is one of the best movies ever made."

kingzdartist,"Apr 16, 2015",10/10,"Excellent film, from the opening to the end you sense a genuine touch into lives of the characters and the world created by the actors and Coppola.Just the intro of the movie immediately reveals the world you've entered and in the next few scenes you familiarized with family which shows who they are at heart.Personally, I love a movie that takes the time to deliver a well told story and The Godfather does just that - the scenes revealing the inner struggles of the characters, the conflict in matters regarding their world, and how each character deals with issues is well done.When a movie makes all their scenes have significant impact so much so that you don't find yourself wanting to pick favorites, you know you're dealing with greatness.From beginning to end I was immersed, and if you like well done movies I'm sure you'll experience the same."
Bored_Dragon,"Oct 17, 2018",8/10,"I finally set out to take three hours to watch ""the best movie ever"" and, frankly, I'm not thrilled. Is it good? It's great. But the best... not even close.8/10"
foxtografo,"Jan 14, 2021",7/10,"I know this movie is prized as a masterpiece, but it's far from it in my opinion.
The acting is interesting (not sure if saying good) and the atmosphere of the movie it's also one of it's strongest points, but not so the photography in terms of composition.
But then the plot is weak, it's unnecessarily long and it leaves me with a sense of being incomplete, besides the fact that there's a ""part two"", even after that I feel the same, but on its own, this movie could be more self conclusive...
Again, and I know it's not a popular one, this is my opinion."
andreiapepo-85369,"Apr 23, 2018",4/10,"I watched this movie three times in an attempt to see why such a poorly written, directed, and acted movie is so revered by fans and critics alike.
Aside from the music (which is the only good thing about this movie really), I found everything about this movie to be mediocre at best. I found the plot to be thin and simplistic, the characters to be one-dimensional and underdeveloped, the cinematography to be pretentious and boring. And the movie itself to be unnecessarily long and lacking of suspense. Overall, it looks like a documentary, and a very bad one indeed.
And the ending was a major simplistic plot convenience to the point of being stupid.
The only logical explanation for this movie's acclaim is that this movie is a mafia propaganda movie to instill fear and respect towards them. And the mafia forced critics to praise this title by placing severed horse heads in their beds!"
jchandbab,"Oct 28, 2000",9/10,"Part of the reason that The Godfather has been so popular, is that on first viewing it really does seem to have something for everyone.  It's a thriller, it's a (fascinating) documentary on 'Mafia Code', and half way through, for 45 minutes, a tragic love story.For starters, the acting is sensational.  There are very few people on Earth that cannot identify Marlon Brando's whispering, horse voice and bulldog expression. It has become what is probably the most famous performance in Hollywood's history.  The appearance of Al Pacino in the starring role is also a highlight.  The other highlights are of course the 'sound bytes'. For anyone who has not scene this masterpiece, I will not give the more famous quotes away- but they will be instantly recognisable when heard.This movie is split into three parts- the crime of the family, and its consequences, the exile of Pacino, and the reunion of the family in which the characters carry out the parts of the plot which set us up for the sequel.My only criticism of this film is how long winded it is.  Virtually three hours long, it is so meticulous that it becomes very hard to digest.  While the sequel is very deep and thoughtful, this tries to balance intellect and action- and although to a certain extent it succeeds, you wonder if this film would be a more enjoyable experience if there was less discussion and plot details, and a few more thrills."
monikahlon,"Oct 10, 2017",9/10,"The first movie I've ever watched that left me with the feeling that I saw something bigger than just a movie. I remember it really well - I was 16, my parents were abroad and I watched it at home with a couple of good friends. When you remember the time and setting you watched a movie so well, it is because it really touched you and influenced you, and that's what I think that movie did to me. You really should watch it. It is an offer you can't refuse!"
Gustavo071,"Aug 21, 2015",10/10,"One of the best movies ever made about the mafia until today! I'm still waiting that arises a work like this movie. Violent and realistic, is a perfect picture of how the mafia could be good and cruel at the same time. Full of meaning, deaths and colorful characters, is absolutely impossible to peel off eyes of the screen for a second even. Is an epic about a descent into hell and desperate attempts to see the light again. And the rise of credits, the viewer realizes that he was facing one of the most powerful stories of love and hatred of the cinema.The Godfather is without a doubt one of my 5 favorite movies, one of the most important films in history, the most commented, imitated and revered in cinema. And is the question: is the best movie ever? When we stop to think about days after seeing the movie we were in doubt, but to watch no doubt of the answer. Almost like an offer we can't refuse.

The legacy of this movie and the way it has affected cinema cant be described in words. Being a fan of organized crime movies I can say that this is my absolute favorite and I cant remember how many times I have watched it.It might be a bit long but It never ceases to amaze the viewer with its brilliant dialogue and excellent cinematography.I would like to thank personally everyone who worked on this achievement of a film.

The Don,Micheal,santino, clemenza or even Bonasera in the very iconic intro scene.
The characters, the cinematography, the sound track looks fabulous .
I can't really imagine how Francis Coppola managed to gather all this cast together most of them were unknown to us.
This movie is really a masterpiece and it is a reference for acting, directing, writing and everything else in the cinema business."

Some have even called it the greatest film of all time. I went into this film with high expectations. As it turns out, the film does not have enough content to fill its long running time, and I got bored while watching it. There are some highlights, but it is not worthy of a high rating. In my opinion, since everyone gave the film a high rating, the newcomers agreed with them, and even though they felt inwardly that the film was not very interesting, they thought, ""But everyone else gave it a high rating, so there must have been some good scenes in the film. Yes, that scene was good. That line was good. After all, this is a masterpiece, as everyone says!"" I feel that they are evaluating the film with a kind of blind evaluation. Well, I have read commentary articles on this film and found some interesting scenes, and I have thought, ""So that's what that was about...!"" But it doesn't have enough impact to raise my evaluation of the film."

iceskergirl123,"Sep 24, 2015",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's screen adaptation of Mario Puzo's novel The Godfather is a cinematic master piece. The thought provoking irony that shrouds the film leaves the audience astounded by the excellence of the work. The characters are all very dynamic and go through extensive amounts of growth throughout the duration of the film. The use of irony, antithesis, and juxtaposition create such a complex story above and below the surface. Although the movie is very complex and layered, it is not too difficult to follow. It is long, so if you want to get the most of the experience I recommend watching it in installments rather than all at once. It will make the movie easier to follow and keep your attention span fresh. There is a lot of violence, but it is not overly gory. It's more tasteful than films of the Tarantino nature. So, leave your guns behind, grab a cannoli and enjoy this exemplary film full of plot and grade A acting."

gabriellbb-76895,"Aug 7, 2015",10/10,"Just an amazing movie with an awesome script! One of the best stories ever told. The way this story is told is something that I couldn't expect, with so much drama but also the reality of that world. We feel so connected with the family, with the characters. The photography increase the drama of the movie. Like the last take, we want so much to see how his going to be with all that power. Absolutely worth watching this movie, especially. You are learning from the very best. It's also the kind of a movie that every time that I watch I can see something different. Very honest with the book. Almost three hours that we can't feel. I wish there were more movies like this these days."
elias-90928,"Jul 25, 2015",10/10,"""The Godfather"" is perhaps one of the greatest films of all time. For me, this film is remarkable, as the authors have managed to create an indescribable atmosphere of Sicily and the mores that reigned there. When you watch the film you think that even the smell of streets, herbs and flowers. A magical music does not leave any chances to watch this movie with popcorn. Definitely, a great film! Great director, cinematographer and composer! In addition, it is deeply Sorcerer movie makes you think and analyze life, the finer points of human relations, reveals the true values ​​of life. Great game actors, watching where you wake up in empathy. This is my favorite movie."
ReviewBuff,"Aug 3, 2015",10/10,"This movie is my favorite. I literally have this movie on every device that I own. And that just tells you how much I love this movie. I mean every scene is a classic.When we can't pick a movie to watch, me and my friends just instinctively settle for ""The Godfather"". We know each and every dialogue and we love saying the dialogues verbatim!Besides, what other movie has so many great actors doing their best work? Where else will you find someone beating Al Pacino at acting then in this movie?This movie just never gets old for me and my friends. And that is why it deserves a 10 star vote!"
yeahclowns,"Aug 18, 2015",10/10,"I'm not gonna write another review of how great and flawless the Godfather is because there are already a lot of them and pretty much everyone knows how perfect the movie is. Instead, I'm gonna share my 17year old guy view of this masterpiece and thus i'll highlight the importance of it. First things first, yes I like blockbuster kind of movies (you know the types) and i've absolutely adored what cinema has brought in, the past 10 years... But, I've seen many movies from the 50's-80's unlike my generation and i have to say that i am fond of 2/10 of them (The 90's, especially 1994 is a happy exception). That being said you cant imagine how big it is that this movie is my 2nd favorite of all time in all of 400+ movies i've seen...! The pacing is incredible, the picture is meant to be timeless, the sound is captivating, the plot is classic, and don't get me started on the performances. Marlon Brando, the greatest actor to have walked on this earth, proved why he is the best with ,maybe, the best performance of all time. I'd seen the streetcar and on the waterfront and i could believe in my eyes... It's a shame it has a rating of 9.2/10 because it truly is at least 9.9/10... even for an objective voting. This generation that spends 15 bucks for 1,5 hour of explosions every summer and another 15 for useless moneymaker ""movies"" will never know the greatness of this 3hour epic... a true masterpiece!!! 10/10!"
chrisk-60,"Jun 12, 2025",N/A,"Over the years, I had heard a lot about this movie but, for some reason, had never seen it. About two years ago, I found myself with a free evening and began searching for a movie to watch online. I ran across The Godfather and thought all right, I'll finally get to see this masterpiece!Although I began watching it with high expectations, they were gone within about 20 minutes. I found it to be boring to the extreme and almost turned it off on several occasions, but I decided to stick with it in the hope that it would improve. Unfortunately, it didn't.By the time that it had ended,I realeized the reason that made it overrated that it was a very good show at 1970s but nowdays its NOT."
OllieSuave-007,"Sep 7, 2015",7/10,"The Godfather is probably one of the ultimate gangster/organized crime movie, a story where aging patriarch Don Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando) gradually tries to transfer control of his crime dynasty to one of his sons, in the midst of a war between the feuding gangster families.Filmed with a much dark and eerie atmosphere, the cinematography captures the grimness and sinister elements of the gangster era, like a film-noir movie. The plot goes at a steady pace, capturing in detail the height of Don Corleone's life from his daughter getting married to the many people turning to him for advice and help in dealing with the nefarious activities occurring in their lives. The suspense builds when the Corleone family clashes with their rivals, resulting in exile, murder and revenge. In addition, Nino Rota's mysterious music score compliments the film well.A lot of characters appear in the movie, but Marlon Brando and Al Pacino were the best in my opinion, delivering their iconic gangster roles with much precision and brilliance.Back to the plot, it does go at a very steady pace and sometimes it does tend to drag the movie to the point of borderline boredom. But overall, it's a pretty good movie, very dramatic and sinister - perfect for crime drama movie fans.Grade B"
shahkhawar,"Jul 14, 2015",10/10,"This is one of those movies that made me wonder why I hadn't seen it earlier.With superb acting by especially Al Pacino as Mike Corleone and Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone this movie shows how one of the head mafia families in New York works, it gives a detailed picture of how their business runs and what kinda chances they got to take on their business.The plot has to be excellent for it to get ten out of ten, and it is, it's far from predictable and the movie is the definition of a great epic. I feel that this movie has not dated all that much and has tremendous re-watch-ability.Do not miss this movie!"
vladislavbalayan,"Sep 7, 2015",10/10,"Tell me a movie that is more famous than this. Tell me a movie that has had more parodies enjambé off its storyline than this. Tell me one movie that has been as quoted as a much as this. The answer is you can't. No movie has had as much of an impact as The Godfather has had ever since it was released.The acting was simply amazing, what else could you say. What could be more appealing to people(even today) than watching actors like Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, James Caan, Diane Keaton, Talia Shire and Robert Duvall. This is like heaven for someone who is a fan of movies. With this movie Brando was able to bring himself back into the limelight. His performance as the godfather alone is iconic. His character has been recreated so much in films that it has almost if it has not already become a cliché. His performance though was not a cliché. His performance was subtle and breathtaking. It was so genuine and realistic that it was not just probably but definitely more genuine than Marlon Brando himself. Al Pacino was perfect for this film as well. What a way to start up your career. His character was all about depth and he displayed it perfectly. He was able to display his own inner-battles in his mind as well as the battles he had with his family, friends and enemies. His character was more of a psychological character study than anything else to me. Robert Duvall to me was the glue to the movie. He added a different perspective to everything in just that he was not Italian yet having the respect of the mafia. His character is a man of high authority within the Corleone family who was listened to and insightful;. This was simply perfect giving the film great balance throughout. The rest of the cast was just icing on the cake.The writing was phenomenal and breathtaking. As mentioned before there has been no movie quoted more than this. It is not even the quotes though that makes the writing in here so perfect. It is the symbolism and meaning that went into every scene. There are countless symbols, messages and lines in here that are so memorable yet it is as realistic as a movie could get.The directing by Coppola was perfect as well. Not many movies can be 3 hours and yet maintain a good level of interest from the audience like The Godfather. Coppola deserves credit for this. The symbolism and messages that went into every scene also has to do with the directing not just the writing. The movie is so well edited and strung together that the only word that could come to my mind is perfection.The cinematography and music were perfect. The score of this movie is one of the most memorable ever. If you were to hear it you could identify it right away. The cinematography was what actually really drove this movie. The Godfather seems to have this mystique to it, it gives you the feeling you are watching something truly remarkable."
sas_ribeiro,"Aug 18, 2015",10/10,"As the film opens, it is the last Saturday in August, 1945 - the Japanese have just surrendered. In the opening scene of the film, the camera (very slowly) pulls back from the face of a man who is in Corleone's dark home office, where the Don regally and ruthlessly holds court. He carries on with the crime family business during his daughter's wedding reception, that is being held in the bright, sunshiny outdoor veranda of his Long Island compound. According to Corleone's Irish-German overseer and surrogate son Tom Hagen (Robert Duvall): ""It's part of the wedding. No Sicilian can refuse any request on his daughter's wedding day."" It is the custom of the father of the bride to grant favors and promises to all petitioners and supplicants who pay homage.Seated in front of the Don's desk is an undertaker named Amerigo Bonasera (Salvatore Corsitto), speaking in a heavy accent (Vito Corleone's wife is god-mother to Bonasera's daughter). Bonasera desperately pleads for a favor - proper vengeful ""justice"" (rather than American justice) for the threatened near-rape and brutal beating suffered by his daughter (whom he raised ""in the American fashion"") by her non-Italian boyfriend and his friend. The two brutes had received a court date and only a suspended sentence:I believe in America. America has made my fortune. And I raised my daughter in the American fashion. I gave her freedom, but - I taught her never to dishonor her family. She found a boyfriend, not an Italian...Two months ago, he took her for a drive, with another boyfriend. They made her drink whiskey. And then they tried to take advantage of her. She resisted. She kept her honor. So they beat her like an animal...She was the light of my life - my beautiful girl. Now she will never be beautiful again...I-I went to the police like a good American. These two boys were brought to trial. The judge sentenced them to three years in prison - suspended sentence. Suspended sentence! They went free that very day! I stood in the courtroom like a fool. And those two bastards, they smiled at me. Then I said to my wife, 'for justice, we must go to Don Corleone.'"
AndreFilip,"Jul 17, 2015",10/10,"As argued by Tom Hanks in You've Got Mail, ""The Godfather meets all the vital questions that come your way in life."" Although for that reason I never would eat oranges: every time someone takes one of those citrus or play with them in the film, has every chance to perish. Maybe because a film that begins without credits, with a speech in which in its initial nine words patriotism, immigration, business, honor, beliefs and hard reality blend (""I believe in America. America has made my fortune ""), and that there does not fail until the final climax, even the high treason-the Michael Corleone takes himself, his beliefs, because the family is above oneself-can not be bad. For Coppola lived to the limit on the set, with the constant feeling that was going to be fired, the producer Robert Evans and Paramount nor were giving truce, nor would leave to finish a film in which he did not believe the beginning (the end of the day, it was about something far removed from his life, the Mafia and was based on a best-seller); and that pressure came the juice of talent, the essence that inspired the new Hollywood. Because Marlon Brando did a test to be hired him, he refused to do so. For young boys came of interpretation: Al Pacino, John Cazale (which only made five films before dying of cancer, but do five jobs), Diane Keaton, James Caan and Robert de Niro reinforcement for the second part. Because neither the music of Nino Rota or photography Gordon Willis have a second of weakness. Because we all love to say what the ""offer he could not refuse"" and think you can get into the bed of an enemy head of a horse. For these reasons and many others, The Godfather is the best movie ever."
Kaitheguy99,"Aug 8, 2015",10/10,"In my Opinion this is one of the best (if not the best) movie ever done. Francis Ford Copolla does such a great job, that You want to watch it over and over. The actors are picked so carefully and good, that you couldn't imagine others playing those characters. The movie portrays the sicilian mafia and the problems the godfather has to face pretty perfect. Compared to other gangster movies like Goodfellas for example, The Godfather has definitely a longer and more interesting story.If you haven't watched it, you definitely should. With 175 minutes running time the movie is quite long, but I promise it is worth it."

SigningSinger,"Nov 2, 2023",7/10,"""The Godfather,"" directed by Francis Ford Coppola, is a film that carries the weight of cinematic history. Its reputation precedes it, and expectations soar as high as the towering peaks of Mount Everest. But does it live up to the hype? Let's delve into the details.The Slow Pace:The film's deliberate pacing has been both its strength and its Achilles' heel. Some viewers might find it too leisurely, akin to savoring a fine Italian meal over several courses. Scenes unfold gradually, allowing us to immerse ourselves in the world of the Corleone family.However, for those accustomed to fast-paced action, ""The Godfather"" can feel like a languid river winding through time. The tension builds incrementally, and patience is required to appreciate its nuances.High Expectations:When you approach a classic like ""The Godfather,"" you carry with you the collective weight of critical acclaim, awards, and cultural impact. It's like stepping onto a grand stage where every note must be pitch-perfect.Unfortunately, this burden can sometimes overshadow the experience. We anticipate fireworks at every turn, but instead, we get quiet conversations in dimly lit rooms. The film's brilliance lies in these subtleties, but they may not satisfy everyone.Performances and Atmosphere:Marlon Brando's portrayal of Don Vito Corleone is iconic. His wheezy voice and deliberate movements convey a lifetime of power and cunning. Al Pacino as Michael Corleone brings depth to his transformation from reluctant heir to ruthless strategist.The tension hangs thick in the air-the smell of cigars, the dimly lit offices, and the hushed conversations-all contribute to an atmosphere that envelops us.Yet, this deliberate approach can alienate viewers seeking instant gratification.Sociopathic Barbarism Disguised as ""Honest Business"":""The Godfather"" strips away the glitz and glamour associated with mobster films. Instead, it reveals the raw underbelly-the power struggles, betrayals, and blood-soaked loyalties.The mafia isn't romanticized; it's portrayed as a ruthless business where family bonds are both strength and vulnerability.Over all, ""The Godfather"" is like a fine wine-one that requires patience to savor fully. If you're willing to embrace its measured pace and peer beyond the surface glamour, you'll find a masterpiece that transcends mere entertainment.Note: While some may find it slow-paced, others consider it a methodical masterpiece. 🎥🍷"
AnkAgarwal,"Feb 13, 2015",10/10,"I have rated over a 100 movies in IMDb and none of them could get a 10/10 score, but this. I think that perfect score was waiting for me to watch this movie. This movie that has set a benchmark for me to rate other movies, ""Is it The Godfather level good or not ?"".This movie for me is an epitome of perfection, it scores a perfect score in almost all the departments, be it direction, acting, music, screenplay, character development, cinematography etc. I just couldn't find a fault with it (and mind you I tried really hard).With a blazing canon of actors which include Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall this film pierces right through you and makes a place for itself. Even days after you watch this movie you will find yourself, in your own private moments, speaking out those wonderful lines, trying to copy Vito Corleone or shape your voice like Michael Corleone. In its own mysterious ways the movie will sure remain with you.It leaves you wanting more, not because there are questions that remain unanswered, but because this film feels so good that you never want to leave it, leave the streets of New York or the Godfather's mansion.All in all Francis Ford Coppola has done a remarkable job that, in the least, deserves a standing ovation and an unanimous cheer of ""Bravo!"". This movie leaves you with an aftertaste of knowing that you have cherished watching an excellent movie."
gerardfarre,"Oct 11, 2015",10/10,"This has to be a masterpiece for me and for my understanding and knowledge. I adore mob films like this one and TV series about the mob as the great TV series I've ever watched: The Sopranos. The shooting of the whole film is sublime, and the shots of the two sequels as well. Coppola got to manage this as a master of film composing. The plot and the development in general is majestic too. The scene of the head horse in the film director's bed is very shocking; I never saw something like that. Now I can only say that this has become one of my favorites films ever (for me and for most of you who are reading this). This is the sort of films that I would watch for many times."
AlexVlad14,"Feb 6, 2015",10/10,"The few ""perfect"" films to ever been released are so perfect in every aspect that each scene almost feels like a masterpiece on its own. In the case of Coppola's revolutionary The Godfather, this statement holds especially true. Phenomenal and sheer brilliance in every aspect that cannot be matched by modern ""cinema"", Coppola's The Godfather is cinematic perfection in every aspect of filmmaking. From performances delivered by an astounding ensemble cast, to Nina Rota's breathtakingly soaring and epic musical score to Coppola's very direction, The Godfather should essentially be viewed as a three hour masterclass on filmmaking for any aspiring filmmakers. So perfect in every aspect and so free of flaws, no film since its time has matched even half the brilliance of The Godfather."
g-bodyl,"Mar 2, 2009",8/10,"I really liked ""The Godfather"" and the content of the movie. But, I think that this movie is overrated. Back in the 70's, this might have been the greatest movie ever. But in 2009, it's not.This film talks about the rivalry between the 5 Italian mafia families living in New York City. The main focus is on the Corleone family. After the patriarch of the family got shot, the youngest son Michael joins the family business for vengeance.The acting is definitely not overrated. Marlon Brando, Al Pacino, and James Caan all delivered marvelous performances that will be remembered forever.The score by Nino Rota is probably one of the most famous and the one that is stuck inside your head for months.One thing I have against this movie is that this movie is very long with boring scenes stretched in. This movie is nearly three hours long. I can accept that for the last LOTR movie because it's interesting and engaging.Overall, this is a great film, not exactly a masterpiece. I rate this film 8/10."
cubiegirl,"Jun 2, 2002",10/10,"I picked this movie up at my local video store this past weekend, as I planned a ""movie night"" for myself.  Quickly into the movie, I found out why many consider this film as the best of all time.  Every performance was gripping, every scene, every character.  Even the time frame (late 1940s) was perfect.  After the movie's final scene, I wanted to rush back to the video store and rent Parts 2 and 3.  Truly a GREAT piece of cinema!"
amesmonde,"Mar 19, 2010",N/A,"Coppola's near perfect masterpiece. A first class cast including, James Caan, Al Pacino and heavy weight Marlon Brando to name a few. There is not much I can add that hasn't already been written, it frankly is the quintessential family, Mafia gangster film.The 1950's nostalgic feel is captured, distinguished cinematography by Gordon Willis and the script honed. The costumes, locations and sets add to the overall authentic experience. Brando's aged make-up is incredible, particularly for 1972 and apart from some insignificant choppy editing and stock footage the film is near enough picture perfect.Timeless, compulsive viewing, there is a reason why The Godfather is on a pedestal as one of the greatest movies or of all time There is no offer to refuse, it's a must see."
nlytnd_1,"Apr 16, 2021",5/10,"I realize this is considered a classic by so many people and if one was alive and saw it pre 1980 it has a nostalgic place that still keeps the movie alive even in this modern era, which I understand... however when one grows up seeing movies like Goodfellas and movies over the last 30+ years, seeing these old time movies come across like a joke. The acting and the overall structure is laughably bad. And Marlon Brando's acting in it is sooo hilariously bad with marbles or cotton balls or whatever shoved in his cheeks and that ridiculously over the top voice. It's so bad it's hilarious.This movie was a classic for it's time, but give me a break I don't believe anyone from the modern era who sees this movie actually enjoys it, they just pretend to like it because everyone else does and they're nothing more than frauds pretending to be cultured by appreciating older cinema. As I said, I can appreciate it for it's time, but one must really suspend disbelief to pretend it's worthy to be compared among movies of the last 30 years."
kenjha,"Dec 27, 2008",10/10,"The Puzo novel is brought to the screen in the definitive tale of the Mafia. A towering achievement for Coppola, who was only 32 when this film was released. Brando is ideally cast in the title role, but his is basically a supporting role. This is the story of Michael, and Pacino is excellent in conveying the transformation of the character from a geeky soldier to a tough mob boss. Caan, Duvall, and Castellano head the terrific supporting cast. Despite the nearly three-hour running time, it does not drag for a minute. The cinematography perfectly evokes the period. Rota's score is one of the most memorable in film history."
uzziek,"Jan 7, 2006",10/10,"Well what superlatives can i give a movie that probably has had them all. This film is and will remain a classic in any era. Up step Al Pacino, from virtually nowhere this actor, amongst a frighteningly illustrious cast, absolutely blows them away and gives a performance that has given him legendary status.Everything about this movie, form the acting, to the direction to the sound track is perfect in every sense of the word. Most people that have not seen the movie will probably think of it as a classic gangster movie, but it so much more then that, family, love, romance, revenge all this in one movie is truly remarkable.For me this movie is my all time favourite it gets better every time I watch it and it rightly deserves to be at the top of the all time movies"

The best way to describe it is with word MASTERPIECE. When movie is in parts I, II ... often only first part is good and others bad, but it is not case with this movie. It's 40 years old movie, and still one of the best, I thing that information tells a lot. Don't miss this movie, because most of you will watch it again and again. :D"
ManuElBlanco,"Apr 29, 2008",10/10,"Don Vito Corleone is the mightiest Mafia boss of New York. He has contacts to the most esteemed politicians and achieves everything he gets into his head. This changes when a drug dealer asks him to join the drug traffic. Vito declines this offer, because he (ironically) considers this ""line of business"" to be a crime. Thereon the drug dealers' men assault Vito and he nearly loses his life. His sons Sonny and Michael thereupon start a campaign of vengeance against the drug dealer and the other dons of New York.With high expectations I began to watch the film, due to the fact that it is the highest rated movie of the IMDb and regarded as one of the best films all-time.In the first half hour there are comparatively few spectacular events, but ""The Godfather"" manages it to tie the viewer, conveying the atmosphere very well. So the movie never becomes boring. The interaction of the Mafiosi, their language and methods are amazingly enthralling. Also the setting (amongst others the film takes place in Sicily) and the film music are outstanding.The main characters are presented very well: The mighty Godfather, who has moralities and takes care of his family despite his racketeering, and on the other hand the ""good boy"" of the family, who is impelled to dirty his hands and become an unscrupulous, ice cold gangster by the assault on his father.Francis Ford Coppola's film becomes a true masterpiece by the performance of the two leading actors, Marlon Brando (Vito Corleone) and Al Pacino (Michael Corleone). Their facial expressions and gestures are just unparalleled and don't lay you to rest.The film won prizes in series (Oscars, Golden Globes)  that's absolutely merited: Everyone should watch this film at least one time; it is a very prestigious film, above all amongst men it is popular, and it has a very high cultic-factor."
jm-deblois,"May 11, 2008",10/10,"The Godfather tells us the tale of a Mafia family and their struggles to keep up with the changing times, and at the same time to value their own morals about family and friendship.This is an excellent movie, the cast ensemble is perfect and the subtle characterization of Michael Corleone played by Al Pacino is beyond recognition. Marlon Brando kicks up a great acting as the Godfather and at the same time a family man. Talia Shire is, as always, quite overacting, nevertheless that quality proved to be effective in this film.The story is unique in every aspect and convincing to the last scene. The irony presented within every climactic event in the story will put you in the edge of your seats and think ""How the heck did they come up to this idea?"" The way the twists are presented subtly, the absence of unessential brutality (which is present in almost every crime films these days), the hidden message of the story, the tragedy, the drama, the flawless direction, and most of all the realistic storyline that makes us infinitely more aware of the life experienced by a family whose business is crime-oriented. A very disturbing yet wonderful experience to watch this film.This is really one of the greatest ever made by the movie industry. You'll miss more than half of your life not watching it. :)"
uhudsavascisi,"Aug 18, 2023",7/10,"The Godfather, directed by Francis Ford Coppola and holding an unforgettable place in cinema history, is a masterpiece. The film focuses on the Corleone family's involvement in the world of crime, while also exploring themes of family values, loyalty, and power.The film stands out with a deliberate yet profoundly impactful pace. By delving into character development and the intricacies of relationships, it presents the audience with a rich and poignant narrative. Marlon Brando's unforgettable performance as Don Vito Corleone breathes life into the characters.The theme of ""power"" is one of the central elements of the film. The complexity behind the Corleone family's criminal empire, the challenges of the pursuit of power, and ethical dilemmas prompt viewers to contemplate. Additionally, the family's loyalty and devotion form the deeply explored emotional dimension of the film.Adapted from Mario Puzo's novel, ""The Godfather"" boasts a highly intricate plot. This richness contributes to the film's captivating and immersive quality. The meticulously crafted atmosphere and attention to detail create an intense world, allowing viewers to intimately experience the underbelly of the criminal underworld and the characters' internal conflicts.However, the film's deliberate pace might test the patience of some viewers. The in-depth character development and intricate web of relationships might not satisfy those expecting fast-paced action.In conclusion, ""The Godfather"" remains a masterpiece, despite its deliberate pace, due to its intricate narrative and rich character depth. Addressing universal themes such as power, family values, and loyalty, it has secured a significant place in cinematic history."
eronavbj,"Feb 24, 2002",5/10,"I thought the book was overdone and corny when I read it in 71; and I thought the movie was overacted and bordered on fantasy when I saw it in 72.Having spent 22 years in a major city's police department, I had occasion to deal with these mob types now and again. They are nothing like those portrayed in the film. They are hollow shells of men who somehow know their bravado is a sham.There are some good action scenes in the picture, but I find the constant atmosphere of universal admiration of thuggery to be aimed at the juvenile patron."
qprmal,"May 10, 2008",10/10,"I have not watched this film since the 70's. But my 18 year old son kept on pestering me to watch it with him because it was the IMDb No1.

I put off watching it with him for ages because it's about 3 hours long and I'm prone to falling asleep. But I watched the Godfather again tonight with my wife and son. We were silent from start to finish with the power and emotion of this film. I just love the way this the film portrays the mafia as an ordinary family that we begin to like. They have staunch religious beliefs in attending weddings, baptisms and funerals plus morals like we won't do narcotics. Yet they can murder somebody and it's just ""business"". The Godfather has no car chase, no gory violence and no idol threats like ""I'm going to blow you away motherf*cker"" It just makes you an offer that you can't refuse."
jeancarloros,"Dec 1, 2015",10/10,"The movie is phenomenal, is rightly considered one of the greatest films ever made. The Godfather continues to influence producers of films, television shows, and video games more than 40 years after its release.It takes its subjects seriously, bestowing legitimacy upon the internecine power struggles of the Mafia normally reserved for classical themes in high art. There is something deeply resonant in the film's treatment of filial piety, the need for respect, and our culture's abiding interest in the parallel moral universe of the Mafia. Just the best."
ackstasis,"Mar 6, 2009",10/10,"'The Godfather (1972)' doesn't need an introduction, nor does it necessarily require a review. Nevertheless, I'm going to go on telling you what you already know: this is one of the great American films of the twentieth century. The 1970s was a landmark decade for Hollywood film-making, and Francis Ford Coppola was particularly productive, releasing the first two 'Godfather' films (1972 - 1974), 'The Conversation (1974)' and, perhaps his magnum opus, 'Apocalypse Now (1979).' This week I was fortunate enough to experience a cinema screening of 'The Godfather,' and this second viewing only inflated my respect for Coppola's achievement. On my initial viewing in 2006, I had been very impressed with the film, but also hopelessly lost for the most part. With literally dozens of speaking roles, and frequent allusions to otherwise unseen characters, the plot had left me stranded, just as 'The Big Sleep (1946)' always manages to do. Suddenly, however, much of it became clear to me; the characters' motivations, deceptions and emotions gently drifted into focus. This was stunning, complex cinema, the sort of bold film-making that puts most modern movies to shame.A notable artistic observation regarding 'The Godfather' is that Coppola's film-making style is strictly traditional. Whereas a new generation of filmmakers like Martin Scorsese and William Friedkin were introducing a gritty new cinema aesthetic, Gordon Willis' cinematography is graceful, understated and handsome, predating his excellent work for Woody Allen {the most notable example being 'Manhattan (1979)'}. A sprawling family saga, 'The Godfather' boasts a staggering ensemble cast of emerging and established actors, as well as many unknowns who nevertheless give letter-perfect performances. The scenes of violence are typically abrupt and effective, but much of the film's running-time is more closely concerned with dialogue and human interaction, particularly among family members. Needless to say, the quality of talent is more than enough to make these scenes, not only watchable, but astonishingly compelling. Every character down to the smallest speaking part  and there are a lot of them  has such a richly fleshed-out personality, making their actions and development throughout the film both authentic and interesting.Marlon Brando  in what, along with 'Last Tango in Paris (1972),' was deemed a grand comeback  gives a towering, Oscar-winning portrayal as Don Vito Corleone, the aging head of an Italian organised-crime family. Having endured decades of corruption and inter-family conflict, and seeing his household disintegrate in the futile pursuit of family honour, Vito finally understands in his final moments the folly of his wasted life, and the fateful mistakes that led to this undesirable lifestyle {these precursor years would be explored in greater depth, with Robert DeNiro in the role, in 'The Godfather: Part II (1974)'}. Most central to the story, however, is the transformation of youngest son Michael (Al Pacino), who, in the course of the film, effectively sells his soul to retain that elusive ""family honour."" The climactic sequence, utilising Eisenstein's style of montage to its fullest extent, intercuts the baptism of Michael's nephew with the simultaneous assassination of the Corleone family's enemies. This scene also serves as a baptism of sorts for Michael, symbolising his irreversible initiation into a life of crime, and the final transaction of his soul."

BeatlesFan3287,"Sep 15, 2009",10/10,"When the Godfather was released in 1972, the golden age of Hollywood was long over. Regardless, this film managed to recall that era while at the same time taking advantage of the ever changing times. This film is darker and more grittier than the films of the thirties and forties as such melancholy was starting to become more common in movies. It definitely didn't forget its roots however. The popular film noir style is very evident in this film: not just in the lighting but in the dark subject matter and often bleak themes. And the themes of the movie are indeed bleak. In fact, as people are shot, blown up, and have revenge acted upon them, an inexperienced movie viewer might wonder what the point is. The point is, under the violence and hate, there is a wealth of good: total justification for the mayhem. The Mafia may be murderous and revengeful, but they have values, possibly even more values than normal, law biding citizens.Marlon Brando gives a breathtaking performance as Don Vito Corleone, a man who is vicious and harden, yet you learn to care for the guy and his family enough so that you eventually root for them every time they get their own way. Al Pacino also gives a great performance as Vito's son Michael, who is different from Vito in many ways. As we learn early on, he could care less about his family's business yet we know he will most likely be shoved into it eventually. We will then learn if he is able to control his family or if he will develop a lust for power and revenge that will cause him to fail altogether. Questions like this are what keep the film interesting and moving forward.The well orchestrated characters also help the plot along and at no point do they seem unrealistic: even when they make drastic choices. And this is important since this is a very character driven film. And that's just one of the many strengths seen here. All great films have multiple strengths and this movie is no exception. Many crime films were made before this film as well as after it. The ones that came before were sometimes weighed down with Hollywood glamor while the ones that came after it were often all flash with no substance: relentlessly violent with no reward in the end for the viewer. The Godfather dodges those weaknesses and it also avoids being pretentious and overblown. Just one of the many things that make The Godfather the best movie of the seventies and possibly the best of all time."

H4wke,"Aug 31, 2025",10/10,"It was only while reading the book earlier this year that I realised how much of this film had stuck with me. I watched it once as a teenager and despite not fully understanding it, the scenes stuck in my brain unlike most movies. The book is surprisingly worse, to be sure, but it does in a way embellish the film upon return.What isn't surprising is how fantastic The Godfather truly is. It goes through the great range of human emotions across sturdy, well-plotted rails. Endless stories about what it took to get this vision on screen are well known by many, and the effort shows brighter than ever.Truly magnifico, one of the great epics of American storytelling. I can't say anything that hasn't already been said."
Leon_Chang_2000,"Jul 29, 2004",7/10,"After watching a lot of the movies on the IMDb top 250 list, I have to somewhat agree with where the movie is placed. I watched the #2 movie, Shawshank Redemption, at least five times and it was just awesome. Finally, I got The Godfather and expected a lot from it, seeing that it would have to be better than Shawshank Redemption. However, I could barely sit through half of The Godfather. Absolutely NOTHING happens. Yeah, so some guy gets shot. Then some people get angry. Wow.Anyway, I would have to grudgingly say that the acting is pretty good, but good acting doesn't make a movie worth seeing. As an old movie, I guess that the overall quality can't be too great. But, even with all that aside, this movie still lacks a good plot, and, maybe even more importantly, emotion. The Shawshank Redemption really made me sympathize with the characters, while this movie just made me go to sleep more quickly (it was that boring).I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."
perky_,"Jan 17, 2025",5/10,"Alright so here's how I feel. I got the same exact feeling when I watched pulp fiction, I've been told it's this masterpiece and that it's one of the best movies ever and then I watch it and... it's not. To be honest it's kinda boring maybe it's just me idk. Here's the thing there's definitely something here like at one point or another I'm gonna rewatch this movie and maybe then it'll be good. I can tell that there's definitely a good story here but this first go around I just can't see it and here the other issue it's so long like personally I don't think movies need to be this long the only movie that should be this long are movies similar to end game like thrilling conclusion movies with a bunch of loose ends to tie up. Something like this it just drags and gets confusing so quickly I constantly had to pause and go back and ask questions like something about this movie doesn't click with me and I really want it to just don't get it and I wish I did and maybe one day I will but today is not that day."

petermiller-25070,"Jan 23, 2024",10/10,"The Year was 1972. The Vietnam War still had 2 more years before it was finally over, Star Wars was probably being written by George Lucas while he was prepping American Graffiti, Watergate was on American peoples minds, Russel Crowe was 8 years old and as for me...........well, i was not even a Glitch in my mothers Womb. That was the Year when a movie came out that was something Special, a movie that we still talk about today and even some might call the greatest film of all time. That was the year of The Godfather!!!!! Francis Ford Copolla directed one of the true cinema greats, and after almost 40 years, its still remains a fine example of a movie that sucks you in from beginning to end and leaves you satisfied like no other film like it. Marlon Brando 'makes you an offer you cant refuse' as Don Vito Corleone, the Head of his Family and Godfather. Brando is such a fine Actor and brings great weight to his role as the Don. Also great is James Caan as Sonny Corleone, the hot tempered son and Al Pacino as the young son Micheal Corleone, who at first does not want to get involved with the family Business until he has no choice. With other great actors like Robert Duvall and Dianne Keaton, the Godfather is a great ensemble that ended up winning a very deserving Best Picture at the Oscars and best Actor for Marlon Brando. Mario Puzo wrote the Screenplay, and its sizzling with Classic Lines and memorable moments. This film, like the old Cagney films before it, paved the way for some other great Gangster Flicks that came rolling along through the years after it, but this stands on the top of the Mountain as the Godfather of all them......"

Mr-Fusion,"Mar 7, 2017",9/10,"Images of a routine baptism juxtaposed with those of mafia rival executions. To me, that's why ""The Godfather""is so fascinating. With these people, such bloody acts are strictly business, impersonal. Great characters and scenes emerge from this conceit, but that's really what it's all about.I don't think you can look at this movie without considering its lasting impact; the famous lines, set pieces and those dreaded oranges. It's all seeped into pop culture, and for good reason. It's just that damn good. Even if you're repulsed by Cosa Nostra goings-on, you still get drawn in.This is an epic in every sense of the word.9/10"

SteelVengeance,"May 27, 2020",10/10,"The Godfather deserves all the love it gets with its fantastic acting, story, suspense, character development, music, and direction. This is the highest standard of film making, Francis Ford Coppola was a genius with his direction in this one and the second. This is a gangster film like no other, the perfect combination. Its like having your favorite food at your favorite restaurant in your favorite city, everything is perfect, from the front and center details to the small and minor ones."
random753,"Jun 12, 2023",10/10,I first expected from this movie to be massively overrated but after I watched I was amazed. In my opinion is the third best movie ever made. It has action and you can't get bored while watching it. It's a three hours long movie but not a single minute was boring. This is definitely the best movie about gangsters and I loved the action. I also liked the fact that this movie is not all about gunshots and stuff like this. It shows us the problems that the Corleone family has to deal with and I was just amazed by the plot. It could be a little bit shorter because some scenes are unnecessary in my opinion but as I said it is definitely not boring. It gets a 10/10.
sergeantbreinholt,"Nov 30, 2016",7/10,"In a word, underwhelming. The Godfather is a decent film with some strong acting, but I did not find any exceptional or unique quality in the film that would render it a masterpiece. It's a simple a mob story in which everybody is an antagonist; the story is not gripping, the characters are hard to care about, the camera work is adequate but not in any way remarkable, the list goes on. I don't think The Godfather is a bad movie, but in no way is it the best I've ever seen, or anywhere close.The movie has been so hyped that I really was expecting to see the best movie all time when I watched it. What I saw was a decent flick with some very quotable moments, but in my mind the film has no singular or superior quality when compared to other great films. Monstrously overrated, but still a respectable movie."
bmattingly,"Jan 20, 2002",4/10,I saw this movie twice. It's an alright movie but really has noexceptional value. Certainly not as much as everyone seems tothink.

Portis_Charles,"Dec 24, 2024",9/10,"The fabulous opening shot and scene immediately establish the spirit and essence of things. ""I've spent my life trying not to be careless. Women and children can be careless, but not men"", says Vito Corleone. It's a great film, an immense narrative that stretches effortlessly over nearly three hours.But nothing is truer than when Connie calls her brother Michael, Vito's son, a ""lousy cold-hearted b...rd."" That's what he is, a cold, heartless killer, a liar with no morals, a snake. That's the limit of the film, absolutely impressive in its narration and direction but giving life to repulsive characters."

samitbh-24476,"Aug 10, 2025",10/10,"The Godfather isn't just a movie-it's a cultural giant that changed cinema forever. Francis Ford Coppola spins a gripping tale of family, loyalty, and power, all set in the smoky, dangerous world of the Italian-American Mafia. It's part crime drama, part family soap opera, and 100% unforgettable.At the center is Marlon Brando as Don Vito Corleone, a performance so iconic it's become part of pop culture itself. With his hushed voice and calm authority, Brando turns the Don into both a loving father and a man you can't refuse. Al Pacino is just as magnetic-his Michael starts off as the clean-cut war hero who changes totally. James Caan explodes as Sonny, full of swagger and temper. And the rest of the cast-Robert Duvall's smooth Tom Hagen, Diane Keaton's conflicted Kay, John Cazale's tragic Fredo-fill every corner with life.The script by Coppola and Mario Puzo is sharp and poetic, loaded with lines people still quote today. And then there's the background score-haunting, romantic, and instantly recognizable, it's the film's heartbeat.The Godfather isn't just about the Mafia-it's about family, choices, and the price of power. Decades later, it still feels fresh, still grabs you by the collar, and refuses to let go. It's not just a classic-it's gold standard."

The writing, directing, acting, soundtrack, cinematography....everything about the film is an A+. I've seen it so many times and I'm such a movie buff that I've made it my life's goal to actually FIND a flaw with the film, but I always come up empty. I've heard the runtime criticized, but there are no superfluous parts to the movie that deserve cutting. I can only hope that we someday see a film that measures up, but won't hold my breath. Bravo."
jojofla,"Aug 5, 2002",1/10,"I continually fail to understand why The Godfather is hailed as ""The Greatest Movie of All Time"".  I've seen it twice--a second time just to make sure--and I have to tell you that I sat there in a stupor, bored out of my mind.  And I'm not a teenager raised on MTV; I'm in my 30s and am absolutely devoted to movies--I've seen as many classics (American & foreign) that I can get my hands on.  But, for me, The Godfather ranks alongside Singin' in the Rain as the most overrated films of all time.Singin' in the Rain, at least, I get (it's just my intense dislike for Donald O'Connor that makes me dislike this film).  But The Godfather?   It's just a bland epic about a bunch of moronic gangsters, with Marlon Brando giving a campy performance, and riddled with repulsive violence.  Give me a break.  The fact that this movie is so ""beloved"" has had the direct result that nowadays we got absurdly worse and worse films every year, created by clueless filmmakers."

I love the characters and all of the different personalities that they represent not just in families but in society itself."
AkselI-5,"Aug 22, 2025",10/10,"Francis Ford Coppola's The Godfather isn't just one of the most acclaimed films ever made-it's a towering piece of storytelling that shaped the landscape of American cinema. It also happens to be my third favorite movie of all time, which says a lot, given the sheer number of films I've seen.Based on Mario Puzo's novel, The Godfather tells the story of the Corleone family, an Italian-American mafia dynasty navigating loyalty, power, betrayal, and change. At the heart of it is Michael Corleone (Al Pacino), a war hero reluctantly drawn into the family business, who evolves into something far darker than anyone expects.This film is a masterclass in character development. Pacino's transformation from soft-spoken outsider to cold, calculating don is one of the greatest arcs in film history. Marlon Brando's Vito Corleone, with his iconic gravelly voice and quiet gravitas, is magnetic without ever needing to raise his voice. Every performance-Caan, Duvall, Keaton-adds weight and nuance to the world Coppola creates.The cinematography by Gordon Willis (nicknamed ""The Prince of Darkness"") bathes the film in shadows and warm ambers, evoking both nostalgia and menace. Every frame feels deliberate, composed like a painting. Nino Rota's score is haunting, instantly recognizable, and soaked in a deep, tragic beauty.What makes The Godfather so powerful isn't just its epic scope or its unforgettable quotes (""I'm gonna make him an offer he can't refuse"")-it's how personal it feels. It's about family, identity, legacy, and the corrupting pull of power. The violence, though sudden and brutal, is never gratuitous-it's always in service of the story.And even though the film is set in a world of crime, it somehow finds empathy for its characters. You understand why they do what they do, even if it horrifies you. That moral ambiguity is what elevates it from a gangster film to a meditation on human nature."
zanderliaw,"May 8, 2022",9/10,"I wasn't born when the movie came out, but grew up hearing how the older generations praise the film to be the greatest film ever made. And I agreed, it was deep, it was majestic. But it wasn't really as legendary as you'd expect, especially when we compare it with the movies we see nowadays. However, the movie was made in 1972 and there probably wasn't much choice back then."

Caan are the winning ingredients of the film. An immense Brando pours all his acting genius into his role, giving Vito Corleone the appearance of a melancholic, mysterious man who, despite his criminal past, is purely respectable and honorable. Only an actor like Brando could give a mafia boss such a profound and multifaceted personality, only he could, in just a few scenes, make a character immortal. Brando's performance is the greatest of all time."

brefane-41162,"Jan 25, 2016",7/10,"I'm a fan of Goodfellas, Donnie Brasco as well as The Sopranos, but maybe because I didn't warm up to or really care about the Corleone family, I can't understand the high and to my mind excessive praise this film receives even if I understand its popularity. The characters are shallow and one-dimensional, yet the film takes them seriously and treats them with gravity; there isn't a shred of irony or humor in this nearly 3 hour film. I didn't find the numerous scenes of the family's business dealings compelling, nor was I persuaded by the film's attempts to draw a parallel between organized crime, business and politics. And Talia Shire, Robert Duvall, Morgana King, Brando, Caan, and Pacino never felt like a family to me; they rarely if ever are all together, and does the Godfather ever meet or talk with Michael's wife Kaye? Brando's performance is an impressive stunt, but it's really a supporting role and the Old Don's manner of speaking becomes tiresome as does the film's solemn pacing. Pacino is the film's star and he is excellent and convincing in his transformation from fresh-faced to poker face. Diane Keaton's Kaye is unbelievably naive, and Talia Shire as Connie carries the melodramatic scenes including a fight with her husband that is redolent of so many other scenes of marital discord. Morgana King as mama Corleone spouts clichés. And though most of the characters are guilty of betrayal, double crossing and murder, I actually developed more sympathy for some of the Corleone's victims notably Tessio and Moe Green than I did for them."
maliceinwonderland88,"Aug 24, 2006",1/10,"This movie is ridiculously overrated. It is merely a overly dramatized celluloid interpretation of life involved with the Italian Mafia. Yes, organized crime is a problem, but this movie is NOT all that amazing. There are entirely too many references to it in other movies, too many spoofs and too many quotes. It's a bad movie. Let it go. There is no real plot line and the bad accents were enough to give me a headache. This movie is mind numbingly boring. It feels as though I lose brain cells every time I am forced to watch this painfully shallow film. Most films following along a similar premise are horribly dull. Why does everyone rave about movies like this and Scarface? They are awful, overly exaggerated and generally badly constructed cinematic failures. A decent script and plot line were substituted for gratuitous blood, gore and explosions. A good movie starts with a good story and a good script, this lacks both. Every aspect of this movie was horribly boring. It does NOT deserve to be named ""The Best Movie of All Time."""

For me it started with the DOP, with the amazing picture. Decoration, accessories, the site, and really the performance of all these stars together.

mclozap,"Nov 4, 2005",10/10,"id just like to say that i think that this film is fantastic. i was never interested in in before and thought that it would be rubbish- i was wrong! i had to watch it for my film studies A-level and am so glad that i did, as i would have otherwise missed out on a great film. the film as a whole is amazing, but my favourite part is when Solozzo is murdered by Michael. i believe that this scene is shot fantastically, especially in the way that it creates tension and suspense and the audience is unsure as to whether or not Michael will actually do it. this is the first step that Michael makes to becoming involved in the gangster world. i also love the closing sequence of this film, when Michael has Carlo killed. once again this scene was shot fantastically, especially the way in which the light was positioned on Michaels face. this was that half was dark and the other light. i believe that this was to show how Michael had changed as a character, and that he was now fully apart of the gangster world, being the Don en' all. you can now see that Michael is a cold and heart-less character, and at the very end when the door is shut on his wife Kate this leaves the audience wanting to know what happens next. i haven't watched the godfather part 2 yet, but i know i have too as apparently it is even better than this film, which i find hard to imagine. but i cant wait to see how Micheal's life develops."

citywideven,"Mar 30, 2022",9/10,I have watched this film so many times now and I never for once got tired of watching it.It's always amongst the first top 10 on the list of the all time great movies.
Movies8586,"Jan 25, 2002",1/10,"Let me just start by saying that I am 50% Italian. I have nothing against Mafia movies. In fact, I have nothing against ANY type of movie. But, to say that this is the best movie of all time is simply insane.I saw absolutely nothing special. I kind of enjoyed the performances of Al Pacino, Marlon Brando, and James Caan... but besides that, there is not one really exceptional feature in sight. And the fact that it is one hour too long only brought down my enjoyment. It's not the worst film of all time... but not the best either."
OguzhanDorul,"Sep 10, 2020",9/10,"A great masterpiece made by Coppola 50 years ago, a great movie. The most important feature is that it is a natural film and it is a reflection of the Italian people to talk about the mafia work in America without causing any trouble.
A big movie that brings big actors to the cinema (Al Pacino, James Caan, Robert Duvall)"
OMAR-218,"Nov 26, 2025",10/10,"So, where should I start, from the beauty of a nature and the photography in that time of a year in the movie, or the cast that every character whether its a major or a secondary i wont stop counting the things i loved in this movie, loved the family bonding shows you that family allways comes first, also the characters devolpment was impressive!, great and real story of the italian mafia and how its going with them & how powefull they were cant wait to watch the part2 and how el pacino will do .Recommended to watch!!"
nmn565,"Feb 14, 2019",10/10,"The Godfather is a 1972 American crime film directed by Francis Ford Coppola and produced by Elbert Roddy and by Coppola and Mario Bozo, adapted from the same novel of 1969. The film starring Marlon Brando and Al Pacino as leaders of one of New York's most powerful crime families. The story stretches from 1945 to 1955, centered on the transformation of Michael Corleone (Al Pacino) from an ordinary person into a merciless mafia leader while also chronicling the Corleone family led by Vito Corleone (Marlon Brando).The Godfather is widely regarded as one of the greatest films in the world cinema and one of the most influential films, especially in gang films. The film is now in second place as the biggest film in American cinema (behind Kane) by the American Film Institute. The film was selected to be kept in the National Film Registry in 1990.He was the godfather for the highest-grossing films of all time, the highest income film of 1972."
ongoam,"Mar 31, 2022",10/10,"I watched various Gangster movies, from the City of God to Goodfellas; the Godfather was one of the greatest movies I ever watched, with Brutal Killing scenes and excellent Performances."
brysonwinnlds,"Jul 11, 2022",10/10,I've never seen a movie that can move me the way the Godfather could. Crime movies try so hard to attain what the godfather did but fail miserably. Unfortunately in the day and age of remakes and sequels I don't see any movie ever topping this again.
joeflemming,"Sep 5, 2018",9/10,Rarely has a sequel been better than the original and in this case that is saying a lot. The Godfather 2 has Francis Ford Coppola bettering his original film which is such a tall task seeing as The Godfather was already so well received upon release. All emotions one can find in a life are presented here. Al Pacino is absolutely sublime as Michael Corleone who has taken over the business and family even though he is young. All the actors are so good you cannot fathom anyone else in their roles. The cinematography is exquisite and the direction so good it makes you wonder what happened to Coppola come the 80s. This is a must watch for any person who appreciates cinema.
quikied,"Mar 9, 2025",10/10,"This movie is special to me, when I was a kid I tried to watch this movie and I couldn't even finished it. The Godfather bored me so much back then. When I was talking to my friends I was saying this movie is overrated not worth to watch. 1 or 2 years ago I watched this movie again from the start and it really affected me differently. And this year I watched it again because I wanted to see Godfather II, I didn't forgot the first movie but, I just wanted to watch again and here is my thoughts.This movie is one of the movies I call life changing. You can say 'how can a mafia movie change a life?'. This movie is not just a mafia movie, it shows us how good was the everything working back then, you should give respect to earn respect. You should be respectful to others, you should protect your family and you should love them more than everything. You should show your love to them. This movie shows manners really well. I don't know anything about mafias but I like this concept and I think this is the most realistic mafia movie, they don't do slaughters every day they just do what they need to do to protect their business or family. Concept is great.Acting and casting is just unbelievable. It's perfect, there is nothing to talk.Michael is really decent character in first movie, I can't talk about the other 2 movies because I didn't watched them yet. I think Tony Montana is great too but Michael better for taking an example.Every scene was really fun and they did great job on locking you to movie. For me best scene was the baptism scene in church, its in my top 3 best scenes of all time.I never gave a 10 to a movie but this movie is a 10. It's just perfect, rewatchable even if it's a long movie it don't feel like it. Everybody should see this movie at least 1 time or 2. But my advance is watch this movie when you are 18+. Not because it's full of gore or bad language, it's for you to understand the movie properly. I know I didn't write my review properly but this is because I can't explain how good this movie is."
askeland89,"Dec 14, 2024",10/10,"I grew up in the 90s, this is not me being biased. This is me telling the truth. The Godfather is and will always be the best movie ever made, objectively speaking. Some of you might think it's a little slow and I guess it is but it kind of has to be. You can't rush a movie like this, it needs to be slow to get it's message across. When looking at it from the right angle it's actually perfectly paced. Every scene is done to absolute perfection and I couldn't find a single weak link in the acting.. Or a single production error. People have been trying to debunk this movie for 50 years but no suceeded. It's as close to flawless as the movie industry will ever get.Shawshank is higher rated and I understand why, it's more casual friendly and not as heavy on details as The Godfather. But in terms of objective quality it really does not get any better than this.10/10 is an understatement. We need a new rating system.. Best movie ever made, hands down."
Phil_H,"Aug 23, 1999",6/10,"Without a doubt, this is a good film. It's got great acting all around, a fine musical score, the cinematography is practically flawless; but it is still lacking in the most important area:It's still a movie that glorifies (or attempts to do so) the mafia.Yes, this film is *really* about family and loyalty, but in the end that becomes sort of sublimated and what you have is a story about criminals, the massive power they wield, and the destruction they cause to those around them.Hardly something worthy of praise.The Godfather is an interesting film, but it's hardly a great film."
sgrizzle,"Jan 18, 2003",1/10,"I follow recommendations on this site highly. I rented this movie and wanted my money back. Ever been to one of those parties with distant relatives where you don't know anyone there and just sit in the corner waiting for it to end?  If so, you've seen 90% of this movie. Throw in a few good scenes that happen so far apart, you forget the last one by the time you see the next one. Might be worth watching once just to say you have, but you'll probably never watch it again. Definitely not ""best movie ever material."""
yaols-53324,"Jun 13, 2020",9/10,"Whether it's acting or the use of lens or music, it gives people a kind of beautiful enjoyment. The film is in great need of deep appreciation."
DavideInfantino,"Jul 14, 2022",10/10,"After 50 years, this movie is still going strong! The cast produced a superb performance. Ford Coppola made it all possible. I can watch this movie again and again...A Masterpiece for many more years to come."
jackjhigson,"Mar 5, 2022",10/10,"My mate Leigh hasn't seen this film. I was a bit confused when he told me like but I thought I'd drop his review on anyhow. Leigh isn't gonna watch this film because everyone sez he should, but he's from Yorkshire and them lot are reyt stubborn.Anyhow, it's an alright film about some lads who do some stuff, some of em die, some of em don't. But I suppose that's just life really."
