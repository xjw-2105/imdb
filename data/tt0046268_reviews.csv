Galina_movie_fan,"Nov 19, 2006",9/10,"""The Wages of Fear"" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Buñuel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because ""if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them"". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory."
dfranzen70,"Jul 9, 2016",8/10,"In The Wages of Fear, four men in a remote South American town have the enviable task of transporting a metric buttload (technical term) of nitroglycerin across mountainous roads in poor condition. It's a taut, superbly suspenseful thriller, guided with a steady hand by director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who would go on to direct the classic Diabolique in 1955.Yves Montand, in a rare dramatic role, plays Mario, the ostensible protagonist of our tale. He's been stuck in this backwater for some time, but it costs a lot of money to get out – plane fares are through the roof, and there's no train, and there's no neighboring village. In short, you're stuck there until you can buy a ticket – and pay for a passport, of course.Mario spends his days looking for work, wooing tavern worker Linda, and despairing about the lack of work. There's an American oil company in town, but they're no longer hiring. His monotonous lifestyle is interrupted by the arrival of fellow expat Jo (Charles Vanel), a tough-looking older man who quickly wins Mario's favor at the expense of the rest of the men in town.The oil company, in fact, has its own problem – one of their large derricks has exploded, causing a huge oil fire. Company man Bill O'Brien decides to send two trucks loaded with nitro from the town up the mountain to the derrick. (The eventual idea is to set off charges, which will somehow contain or extinguish the fire.) O'Brien has no trouble scaring up volunteers for the task, since the men of the town are largely unemployed. Four men will be selected to take the two trucks. Only one truck is needed; the second is truly just in case there's an accident with the first one. The men will receive $2000 when the work is finished, more than enough to secure passage out of the backwater.Mario and Jo are chosen, as are Mario's roommate Luigi (Folco Lulli) and German expat Bimba (Peter van Eyck). The two trucks depart early in the morning, full of gas and of nitro. Danger awaits.Theirs is not an easy task. The road is full of ruts. In one place, the wooden deck that trucks use to make a sharp turn up the mountain has been damaged from disuse. It's hot and muggy. And one has to be very, very careful, as even the smallest bump might set the whole shebang off. There's also tension among the four drivers – Luigi is unhappy that Mario is spending more time with Jo than with him, Mario is unhappy with what he perceives as Jo's cowardice. Bimba seems to get along with everyone, though.The whole time I was watching this movie, I was certain not all four were going to make it. I will not spoil what is now a sixty-three-year-old movie, but I was still genuinely surprised by the ending. This ain't no fairy tale or sitcom. This is a movie about desperation, redemption, sacrifice, and comeuppance. It's not necessarily about justice.The Wages of Fear is a singularly terrific movie from start to finish, exquisitely shot and expertly written. Its money maker is its tension, something present here in spades. The writing is impeccable; even personality changes make perfect sense within the film's context. There are intricacies within a straightforward plot. This is a must see for lovers of thrillers."
rooprect,"Mar 14, 2020",8/10,"My title is not an exaggeration. If you thought OJ Simpson's slow speed chase was insane, you need to change the batteries in your pacemaker and check out ""Wages of Fear"". This 1953 French classic tells the story of a bunch of guys who are stuck in a squalid South American village--a sort of Casablaca-esque purgatory--and will do anything to get out, even if it means getting themselves blown sky high. Slow and lazy for the first half (deliberately), the plot eventually reveals itself to be about a suicide mission to haul a zillion gallons of nitroglycerine across 300 miles of harsh terrain that would make the Coyote & Roadrunner take an early retirement.Yes, nitro is that stuff that you don't want to look at the wrong way or it may send you to the moon. ""Wages of Fear"" ultimately reveals itself to be a gripping character study of how people keep their wits, or come unravelled, when subjected to pure terror... with of course the reward of heaven dangling just out of reach. So again we see this subtle allegory of purgatory, hell and heaven which I'm sure was the intent of director Henri-Georges Clouzot.An interesting point of historical note is that when this film was released in the USA, around 15 minutes of its 150 min running time were cut. According to the Criterion mini-documentary ""Censored"", these cuts were largely due to the ""anti-American"" themes (the tyrannical oil corporation that exploits the lives of locals for the sake of a buck) as well as subtle themes of spiritual cynicism (the beautifully poetic ""fence"" monologue which symbolizes the absence of God/afterlife). By today's standards these censored scenes are prime time tv, but back in the 50s this movie was feared by US censors as being godless pinko propaganda. That might put a smirk on your face as you're watching this flick. But definitely look for the full 150ish minute version of this film, not the 130 min censored cut.But really, for the entire second half there will be no smirking, only tense gritting of teeth as you watch these rolling nuke trucks inch across the South American jungle. The hazards they encounter, as well as their ingenious attempts to survive them, are extremely creative and expertly filmed with the sort of suspense that would make Hitchcock lose his breath.Content advisory stuff: There's a scene in the beginning where a fine tarantula specimen gets squashed. After rewinding and rewatching the scene in slo-mo a dozen times, I'm almost certain that our unfortunate arachnid was a fake prop. If anyone knows differently please mention it in a review. The same scene shows a naked woman from behind, at a distance. Later in the film is a scene that shows a topless native woman from a distance--it's very artistic. Language is tame throughout the movie with maybe 1 or 2 instances of ""merde"" (the sh- word). While there is violence, none of it is shown explicitly on camera (some of it is disturbing, though). And unless you're a 1950s American censorship bureaucrat, there's nothing politically incendiary other than the notion that the almighty dollar is the root of much misery.""Wages of Fear"" is a well crafted, poetic, suspenseful film that certainly deserves its classic status in the history of cinema. Not unlike the classic Bogart/Lupino film ""They Drive by Night"" (1940), this film proves that a seemingly simple story about a bunch of truck drivers can really get your gears going."
barleeku,"Oct 6, 2005",10/10,"This movie is astonishing, a gritty story filmed in an ultra-real style that relies simply on the beauty of lighting and film to achieve its stunning effects. It seems from another world, which in a way, it is. The acting is superb: Montand's Mario is full of jerky movements and intense impulses but always maintains his Gallic savoir-faire, while Charles Vanel as Jo brings, at first at least, a type of macho to the screen that modern movie-makers simply do not comprehend. The rest of the cast, especially the camp chief, Luigi, and Peter van Eyck as Bimba are incredible, as is Vera Clouzot who is incomprehensibly but believably upbeat and innocent - and totally gorgeous - in the midst of the hellhole of a town they're all stuck in. Clouzot's directing is flawless - I don't think anyone has ever squeezed more tension with just a few essential scene elements. The trucks wheeze and grunt as well as they ever have in the movies - the only comparison is Spielberg's early gem, ""The Duel"", but Clouzot's automotive cinematics outdo even Spielberg. The stripped down existentialism of the characters, the starkness of their shared dilemma, the grim and grimy scenery, and the cinematography itself are all of a piece. The latter is what elevates this movie to the very top rank, including some of the most dramatic and effective black and white shooting I've ever seen. Yet it never becomes mannered or gratuitous - it is orchestrated with the rise - and rise! - of tension in the film. The final scene takes on a surreal as opposed to ultra-realistic quality that has its own logic. One last word about the acting - we don't see anything like it anymore. The self-conscious mannerism of method acting (which has had its own triumphs) and the toxic awareness of everyone from the actors to the audience, the camera, directors, etc. that each actor is a celebrity and potential artiste, has ruined that conviction that actors were once larger than life people before they went on-screen, that they came to acting as an outcome of living rough, unadorned, and yet imaginative lives as opposed to shooting for fame and fortune and celebrity within an artificial corporate star-making incubator."
grillrobert,"Nov 2, 2004",N/A,"This movie is a true masterpiece in every way! When I rented the DVD and read the story it sounded familiar, because I had watched the newer version before in color with Roy Scheider, which was good as well. But watching the original film truly blew me away. This movie is well made in every detail. It puts a lot of detail-work in the creation of the characters, and once you think that is over and the ""regular action-part"" starts, it becomes even better and the story takes a 90 degree turn! After I had finished watching the entire movie, I needed at least 5 minutes just to ""digest"" it and rethink this fantastic film. If you got a chance to watch it, don't miss it! It is entertaining from the first to the last minute!"
dtb,"Apr 24, 2005",9/10,"Georges Arnaud's novel LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR has been filmed twice, by Henri-Georges Clouzot as THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and by William Friedkin as SORCERER (1977). While both films are worth seeing, the earlier version is the one regarded as a classic, and rightly so. Although SORCERER goes into more detail about the political climate and the various misdeeds that led the four desperate protagonists to the South American hellhole where they accept high-paying but life-risking jobs driving nitroglycerin through treacherous terrain, WAGES... distinguishes the men's personalities better, giving the audience more rooting interest in them. Both films have excellent casts, with charismatic leads in Yves Montand (WAGES...) and Roy Scheider (SORCERER), plus WAGES... also provides feminine charm in the form of beguiling Vera Clouzot as the café waitress who loves Montand. Both films have tense action sequences as well, but somehow for all the staging and skillful editing, SORCERER's action scenes seem strangely slow, slogging along in the mud just like the protagonists in their less-than-state-of-the-art trucks. Both versions have enough good things in them to be worth a look, but if you only have the time and resources to check out one of them, it's WAGES... that really pays off!"
DennisLittrell,"May 7, 2002",10/10,"This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter.This is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.Yves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.This is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.Henri-Georges Clouzet directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzet's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.Clouzet's wife, Vera Clouzet, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.No student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. ""La salaire de la peur"" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
Mick-81,"Mar 8, 1999",10/10,"A completely novel plot.  Happened upon this on late night TV about 10 years ago.  Thought I had seen all the best of the classics and then this came on.  ""Where have you been all my life?"" was the overwhelming question.  What an incredibly beautiful and stark movie at the same time.  Absolutely unprecedented.  Everything about it--especially the cinematography (check out the scene with the turnabout for the trucks) is superior.  If you care about plot, allegory, intelligent directing and acting, this is one which is second to none.  Nitroglycerine being transported across the Venezuelan countryside. . .who comes up with this stuff?  The remake (Sorcerer) is decent, but doesn't even come close.  Outstanding flick."
Xstal,"Oct 24, 2022",8/10,"You're living in a barren, beaten land, in South America where the lost and lonely band, no way to pay for your escape, the barrels bottom is all you scrape, this ain't the dream that had been promised, or been planned. Then your offered a way out, a chance to flee, there's a price to pay but soon you could be free, if you drive a laden lorry, you can wrap yourself in glory, $2000 you'll receive as the payee.If only driving a wagon a few hundred miles was all there was to it. A fantastic piece of film making that demonstrates how far people can sink and what boundaries they're prepared to cross to extricate themselves from those depths."
Spleen,"Dec 2, 2001",10/10,"This is richer, tenser, more atmospheric, and in all ways a better film than Clouzot's next one, ""Les Diabolique"" - which is saying a lot.  I've never understood why Clouzot isn't more highly regarded.  Indeed, for a long time I simply couldn't believe that he wasn't.One charge that hangs over his head is misogyny.  With regards to ""Les Diabolique"" this is simply ridiculous; with regards to ""The Wages of Fear"", I can see how one could harbour the uncomfortable feeling that there is, perhaps, something in it.  But what, really, does the evidence amount to? The fact that one of the heroes is inexcusably cruel to his girlfriend? It's not as if the film endorses this, or invites us to take pleasure in it, or even, for that matter, allows us to.  The characters are all flawed, and the film doesn't seek to deny it.  It does, however, make an attempt to explain it.  That town in the middle of nowhere is, we feel, really in the MIDDLE of nowhere; it must be the dustiest and most demoralising place on Earth.  After a while we feel as if we could start kicking someone, just to break the monotony.There's no doubt that the initial monotony gives the rest of the film half its strength.  William Wyler once said that if you want to surprise or shock an audience the best thing you can do is bore them half to death beforehand - and although I can think of absolutely no reason why this should be so, allowing for a little exaggeration, it's true.  The seemingly aimless opening sequences help make every single frame, from the moment the nitro-glycerin is mentioned, electric.So much is, in retrospect, amazing.  There's the way Clouzot manages to show us the humanity in these seemingly squalid people.  (Even the oil magnate, just when we think he's the world's most heartless capitalist, reveals he has a heart with an unexpected remark, and yet the remark doesn't feel at all out of character - it's the kind of masterful characterisation film-goers live for.)  Then there's the obstacles these drivers must face. All are memorable; most are so perfectly realised they deserve to be called mythic."
Vartiainen,"Jun 20, 2017",7/10,"The setting is a dead end South American village in the middle of nowhere. Its only distinguishing feature being an American oilfield some distance away from the village. But then an accident causes a fire to spread into the oil and the only way to stop it is to literally blow it out. With nitroglycerin. The only problem being that they don't have the safety equipment needed to transport the nitro from the village. But ""luckily"" such villages have no shortage of men at the end of their ropes, willing to do anything for a final paycheck.And that's essentially The Wages of Fear in a nutshell. It's about human desperation and about ever-mounting stakes as the tension keeps rising and rising. Every little tremor or stone on the road could send all four men into the sky in a fiery explosion of primordial forces. And even though you're safely hunkered on your coach, behind the reality line of a TV screen, you can't help but sweat in anguish alongside these men. The film is that well shot.That being said, it takes its sweet time getting there. The first portion of the film is spent getting to know the village and these four wretched souls. And while they are interesting personalities, played by talented actors, it still drags quite a bit. And that's partly because at that point you don't have much of an idea where the film is going. Most of the loose threads get tied up towards the end, but a good half of the film is a jumbled mess.But that other part where they're actually transporting the explosives is so good that it more than makes up for the weaker first half. Recommended for all fans of intense."
Stu-42,"Apr 27, 2001",5/10,"This movie was billed as being possibly the most intense, suspenseful film of all time. Even though I came open minded ready to enjoy it, I found it tough to sit through with only a few scenes with short moments of suspense. There are a few explanations that could cause this discrepancy: The difference between seeing it 50 years after it was made, the unlikability of any of the characters, the impossibly long first half with not much of interest, the terrible, almost laughable performance of the oil company operator, the implausible happenings along the way to the fire or the ridiculous ending. In any event, one can only guess at what this might have been like when it first came out. Yes, there were some interesting underlying ideas and some scenes that held your attention, but at this point I would go against my usual feeling and say that there needs to be a remake and since there is one, I will now try to find Sorcerer to see what that's like."
Infofreak,"Feb 3, 2003",N/A,"Clouzot rarely gets the attention he deserves. He made not one, but two of the greatest thrillers of all time, 'Les Diaboliques' and 'The Wages Of Fear', both perfect examples of how to make genuinely suspenseful movies that build up an amazing amount of tension.  Most so-called thrillers made in Hollywood these days are thrillers in name only and could learn a lesson or two from these movie classics. 'The Wages Of Fear' could even be described as an action movie, but it is a CHARACTER DRIVEN action movie, and that's what makes it so special. Modern audiences with MTV attention spans might find the plot a little slow, but I think the first half of the movie, which deals with the motley collection of exiles in a poor Latin American town, is not only fascinating in itself, but really makes a massive impact on the second half. By taking his time introducing the characters and exploring their relationships and possible motivations, Clouzet adds depth and meaning to the rest of the exciting story, something very rarely achieved in this type of movie since. The cast, every single one of them, are flawless. The four leads, Mario, the fairly decent guy played by yves Montand, his new best friend the shifty M. Jo (Charles Vanel), his old pal the kind hearted Luigi (Folco Lulli), and the enigmatic Bimba (Peter van Eyck), are all brilliant. Great performances, taut and imaginative direction, crisp and impressive cinematography, and a handful of the most riveting sequences ever committed to film make 'Wages Of Fear' a truly unforgettable experience. Suspense movies don't come much better than this! Simply a masterpiece."
planktonrules,"Jul 16, 2005",9/10,"The first quarter of this movie was not particularly exciting but did set the stage for the rest of the movie. So, if you initially feel bored--STICK WITH IT!!! The plot is so incredibly simple that it seems like it must be a pretty boring picture: an oil company in South America needs to transport shipments of nitroglycerin 300 miles to an oil fire ASAP. However, due to the rotten condition of the roads and equipment, the trip seems like certain death, so they get some hungry out of work guys to do this. It doesn't sound very interesting, I'm sure, but it is. The writing, editing, pacing, acting and direction are PERFECT during this LONG trip. So many times, I found myself tensing up or moving in my seat as each near-death event occurred. The only negative? Well, the ending might be a bit of a letdown for some (though, in hindsight, I liked it despite being a bit of an anticlimax)."
grantss,"May 26, 2018",9/10,"In a remote South American town, four men are hired by an American oil company to transport two truckloads of nitroglycerin to an oil field, to put out a fire. It's a very hazardous task - the nitroglycerin can explode for the slightest reason, the road is treacherous and the journey is a long one. However, the money is very good and their current situation in the town is rather dire - they will do anything to improve their situation.Great thriller-drama by French director HG Clouzot. Starts slowly and even once the hazardous journey is in progress, it doesn't seem that brilliant. However, Clouzot builds the tension and from a point it is absolutely nail-biting stuff. The scene with the boulder has to be one of the most tense movie scenes I've watched in my life.A good character-drama too - the way the characters develop and the relationships between the four change adds a new dimension to the drama and makes for very engaging viewing.Not perfect though. Some events and plot devices don't make much sense, though aren't crucial to the movie. The ending felt quite silly and contrived. A similar result but with a more plausible, less predictable, less stupid way of getting there would have seen the movie get a perfect score."
daoldiges,"Jun 13, 2018",9/10,Clouzot tells a tale of suspense and drama that man finds himself captive to. The thing that creates the drama is very straightforward and easy to grasp (a truck full of nitroglycerine). I think it is that simplicity contrasted with the complex and impossible to understand nature of man that makes this story so compelling and successful. Definitely worth checking out.
evanston_dad,"May 20, 2010",9/10,"Four unsavory down-and-outs whiling away their hours in a poverty-stricken South American village accept the fool's errand of transporting two truckloads of nitroglycerin across terrible roads to an oil company accident site. Once some preliminary character development is disposed of and the men are on their way, the movie settles into one hell of a nail-biter, sort of a French, 1950s inversion of ""Speed"" -- if they go too fast, or make one false move, they go up in flames.The first hour of ""The Wages of Fear"" is a marvel of production design. Director Clouzot packs his frame with things to look at, and the village, though built specifically for the movie, reeks of authenticity. The mise-en-scene alone is fascinating to watch -- some incidental action going on in the background of one shot (like a hothead smacking his girlfriend) is then picked up as the principal action in the next scene. And the Blu-Ray looks terrific; every mud puddle and heat-dazed fly is clear as a bell.The second half of the film is pure suspense. It's a study in male machismo and one-upsmanship. The oldest member of the group, who struts around like Mr. Big Shot in the town when he has nothing to fear, crumples like a baby when faced with the prospect of death for real. But the movie doesn't let us be disdainful of him. As he says at one point, he's scared because he has enough life experience to know what death is, unlike the young hotshots who think to be frightened is to be weak.Clouzot doesn't seem to have a rosy outlook on life, if the film's fatalistic ending is any indication. Or maybe he's just making the point that life is futile for men who approach it in a certain way.""The Wages of Fear"" feels way ahead of its time, both in style and substance. I had trouble believing that it was actually made in 1953.Grade: A"
lasttimeisaw,"Jun 25, 2018",9/10,"A 4K-restoration screening in the Shanghai International Film Festival, Clouzot's pièce-de-résistance is a vehement testimonial of his aptitude in orchestrating white-knuckle thrills and chills, meanwhile, it is also a scorching dissection of human's abject fear and cruelty.
 
Set up in the boondocks of Las Piedras, allegedly Venezuela, a posse of foreign deadbeats is vegetating under the blistering sun, jobless and hankering for a plane ticket to leave the purgatory, they are churlish opportunists and rowdy bar brawlers, among them stands the French ladies' man Mario (a sexpot Montand), who toys with the affection of the barmy barmaid Linda (Mme Clouzot in her film debut), and has no qualms about jilting his benevolent Italian roommate Luigi (Lulli, truly the salt-of-the-earth type), to hobnob with his blow-in compatriot, the ex-gangster Jo (Vanel), fancying an easy way out, but the truth is, Jo is also at the end of his rope.A perilous job opportunity emerges when the American corporation Southern Oil Company needs to transport nitroglycerin to extinguish a massive fire in the oil fields, four drivers are chosen to drive two trucks in conveyance of the highly explosive products in a 300-mile rugged haul, with no safety precautions at hand The sideswipe of American capitalistic avarice and callousness is pretty much in your face, yet, for these hardscrabble expatriates, $2,000 is an offer too tempting to refuse, after some backhanded maneuver Jo gets the last spot to drive with Mario, while Luigi is paired with Bimba (Van Eyck, stolid and unbelievably cool), a taciturn German who endures a dark past.Henceforth, Clouzot viz. the Gallic Hitchcock takes audience on an ensorceling edge-of-the-seat road trip where one single substantial bump can cause their trucks to be blown up to smithereens, like a ticking bomb hanging over our heads. Compelling set pieces, a gripping turn on the precipice, and detonating an obstructing rock, one mobile, one static, are textbook paragon of tension-building and suspense-eliciting, not to mention the effect graced by Georges Auric's captivating accidental music.However, physical obstacles aside, it is the mental exertion that takes a heavy toll en route, Jo, the hard-nosed, savvy spiv, gradually yields to the mounting fear and his cowardice starts to turn Mario from his toady to a hectoring boss, sending contempt and verbal abuse to a humiliated Jo, up to a merciless last-ditch attempt knowingly leaving him mortally wounded, here Clouzot's astutely differentiates true grit from Dutch courage, and examines the phallocratic pride with utter acumen, its reverberations is astounding, much also owing to the two protagonists' unyielding tours-de-force, especially Vanel, completely devotes himself to the grueling condition (that petrol wallowing sequence is awestruck), and more credibly, he tenaciously enlivens Jo's transformation from a despicable wide boy to a resigned old geezer, for whose aftermath we feel deeply sympathetic.Our compassion towards Montand's Mario also undergoes a sea change when the plot thickens, his raffish charm morphs into an admirable determination midway, until his ruthless color takes the upper hand, Montand perfectly showcases his marquee idol charisma, and his baptism-of-fire triumph is unqualifiedly hard-earned, but Clouzet ratchets up the morbid irony in its dizzy ending, as augured by its opening, the quartet's fate is hanging on the same thread, negligible, expendable and inescapable.Incontrovertibly, THE WAGES OF FEAR is a daunting progenitor for late comers to emulate but impossibly to surpass, denotes a hefty import of Clouzot's unrivaled cinematic legacy, that reinvented narrative cinema with its high-octane vicariousness."
ccthemovieman-1,"Sep 10, 2006",6/10,"This French film was re-made for English-speaking audiences in 1980 with the title, ""Sorcerer,"" and I've watched that film a half-dozen times. It's excellent and, frankly, a far more interesting movie than this one.That is not to say Wages Of Fear is not without merit. It's just that most of the first hour of this film is wasted. It has little meaning. At least in the 1980 version, it showed how four men from around the world got to where they were and why they took the chance they did. here, even tough the pre-journey intro is much longer, it's vague with too many scenes that mean nothing. Once the action starts - the two-truck, nitroglycerin-filled 300-mile trip through rugged terrain - this is an interesting film as well. Then it paints a better picture of the personalities of the four men while keeping good suspense. That general suspense story is the same in both movies but the obstacles along the way of the treacherous journey are different and the fate of the men a bit different.There is some excellent black-and white cinematography in this film and a big reason for me to see it again, this time on DVD. However, I might skip some of that first hour."
frank_olthoff,"Jul 3, 2001",N/A,"Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méliès, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""Le salaire de la peur"" is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70's, 80's and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn't go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel's character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.Apart from that, Clouzot's wife Véra (also well-known from his ""Les diaboliques"") plays to the ""most breathtaking angles"" gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno's gin joint. It's a man's world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it's existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in ""Salaire"" (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Dec 24, 2020",8/10,"The name of the game in 'The Wages Of Fear (1953)' is suspense: pure adrenaline-pumping, white-knuckled, edge-of-your-seat suspense. Of course, its hugely extended set-pieces aren't the only thing that make the movie great. There's a surprising amount of solid character work, especially when it comes to one particular character who ends up revealing himself to be the total opposite of what he is initially set up to be. It's a remarkable transition and it showcases some really solid acting skills (you've never seen anyone act scared until you've seen this). After a relatively slow opening that makes a point of portraying the lacklustre employment prospects of the town that our unconventional characters are stuck in, the piece kicks into gear and gets a handful of its players started on a journey that turns every bump in the road, every shift in suspension, every pebble in their path into deadly obstacles. This situation is milked for all it's worth; it grips you and never lets you go, forcing your heart into your mouth more times than you can count. It's soaked in dread, too. The film is definitely one of the - if not the - most suspenseful that I've ever seen. Frankly, it's a masterpiece. Though its first half is fairly slow, nowhere near as compelling as its second and showcases a couple of major characters who display some blatant sexism and racism, the affair is ultimately an affecting and memorable thrill ride. It's one of the best of its kind. 8/10"
The_Void,"Jun 14, 2005",9/10,"Henri-Georges Clouzot is probably most famous for his atmospheric mystery drama 'Les Diaboliques', but just as good is this film; Wages of Fear. The film gives a commentary on the things that people will do for money, and it follows a treacherous journey across South America for two two-men teams of truckers transporting nitroglycerine across the continent for an American oil company, on the promise of $2000 when they reach their destination. The men taking this task on know very well what the risks are, but they decide to do it anyway just because they need the dough. Rather than just feeding us this premise, however, the great maestro has opted to make sure that we fully understand the situation that our protagonists are in. The first hour of the film just sees the main characters in their native village, scrimping and slowly killing themselves just to make enough money to live on. These guys have to drink lemonade when they go to their local drinking establishment, and this image of themselves is putting them on the back foot further still, as no one in the town will employ the people that they see as tramps. This back building gives the audience something that the main crux of the story wouldn't have otherwise; and that's understanding from the audience.Once the action starts properly, Clouzot really lets rips with his awesome directorial talent. Like he did with Les Diaboliques two years later; he really shows that he knows the meaning of suspense. The nitroglycerine loaded trucks in the movie could explode with the slightest vibration, and once again Clouzot makes sure that you understand the situation. The movie firmly balances itself on a short string, and any minute the leads could go up in flames; which gives the action a very potent degree of tension and suspense at all times, even when there isn't all that much going on. There are some very good stunts in the movie, however, and things such as the oil lake and the huge boulder in the middle of the road represent the best of them. The characters are both well introduced and well rounded, and Clouzot has given each of the four main men in the film their own distinctive character and because of the extensive situation building that the director gave us towards the start of the movie, we always care for them; which helps the movie no end when it comes to the more touching moments of the story. On the whole, this is a GREAT motion picture. It's a lesson in suspense and it's a film that anyone who considers themselves to be a fan of thrillers should see."
KnightsofNi11,"Jul 16, 2011",9/10,"If you want to talk about a film that is exceptionally dark for its time then look no further than The Wages of Fear. The film follows four men in a desolate South American village who are strapped for cash and will do almost anything. They agree to transport a shipment of nitroglycerin by truck across the rugged terrain of Central America. The catch is that nitroglycerin is an extremely dangerous substance that has to be handled with extreme caution. Thus one bad bump in the road could be the end for these men. Along the way then encounter all sorts of obstacles, including each other. But they have no choice but to press on, desperate for the money that awaits them at the end of their treacherous journey.The Wages of Fear captures what true suspense is all about. The film is full of incredibly high tension scenes that will leave you on the edge of your seat in stomach churning anxiety. You feel every drop of anguish the characters feel as they run into obstacle after obstacle, growing more and more tired and frustrated with their circumstances. The tension amongst the group mixed with the tension of the situations these men get themselves into makes the suspense almost unbearable but wildly exciting. This film engages its audience so fantastically. You feel a part of you amongst the action as the film draws you further and further into the riveting suspense this film delivers. I don't remember the last time I was this engaged in a film and was so anxious about what could happen. The gravity of the film is so immense as it forces its fear upon you so unapologetically powerful.But of course it gets better. Not only is The Wages of Fear an riveting suspense film, it is also an intense character study. We have four characters transporting the nitroglycerin, Mario, Jo, Luigi, Bimba. Each of the men have a unique personality and different ideas about this job. Some are desperate for the cash and will stop at nothing, even if it means risking not just their life, but everyone else's as well. Then there are those who would rather give up when things become too harrowing and too risky. The clashing of these two ideas create some intense scenes of psychological anguish. The ironic thing is that these four characters begin the film as friends, but the journey transforms them and turns them against each other in thrilling and disturbing ways. The film has a fantastic script which examines these things intensely and eloquently. It is a truly brilliant cinematic feat.The film works so well as a character study, while also being an incredibly intense film full of riveting suspense. The combination of these two elements is done so perfectly, neither one taking over the other. Instead they blend beautifully, making an astoundingly powerful film. I wouldn't hesitate to call this film a masterpiece, so I will. The Wages of Fear is a masterpiece."

""If only you had guts too.""
""Yours'll be hanging from a tree.""Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is stunning on multiple levels: the incredible tension in the story, of course, but also the level of detail in the grime created in its location, the development of its characters, and the commentary on American imperialism and how big corporations exploit impoverished workers. This is one that worked in every way for me, and I was riveted for all 153 minutes.It boggles my mind that this was filmed in the south of France, with a remote rugged area filling in so well for a nameless South American country, and the village having been built entirely for the film. The level of realism is very high, setting a gritty tone which amplifies what the film is saying about humanity. Cruelty and hubris abound. The cruelty of the past, reflected in the German character's scars from the war, the cruelty of the wealthy, reflected in the company treating workers like disposable assets, and the cruelty of the poor to each other, reflected in the ruthlessness of the main characters in both the town and on the mission.The transformation in the relationship between the two Frenchmen is one of the many highlights of the film, even if it's tough to watch at times. The older man (Charles Vanel), a tough guy who likes humiliating others in town, gradually melts under pressure, while the younger man (Yves Montand) is increasingly callous over time (and my goodness, that oil spill scene!). ""Maybe you were a man in grandma's time! All you can do now is shoot from behind!"" he bellows. Meanwhile, there is real pathos in the Italian guy (Folco Lulli) dreaming of a house in Calabria but having a terminal lung disease from his work, and the German guy (Peter van Eyck) gradually informing us of his past, which included his father having been murdered by the Nazis, and himself assigned to slave labor for three years.Fresh-faced Véra Clouzot seemed a little out of place in this grimy town, but I was glad to see her, and the pathos of her character, dominated and used for sex by her boss (Dario Moreno), and mistreated by her boyfriend (Montand), reinforced the rest of the film. The meanness of the latter is a nice bit of foreshadowing of how ruthless he will be on his ""road trip"" later.All of the psychological tension results from these men feeling like they have no other way of getting out of this dirty little town, one they regard as a prison, and being enticed to undertake a very high risk operation for a relatively small amount of money. The whole task set up because an American oil company has had a massive explosion, and gets them to go on a dangerous mission. ""Wherever there's oil, there's Americans,"" one character says. It's beyond aggravating to think that American censors at the time took offense to this, and the ""land of free speech"" had these sentiments cut out of the U. S. release at the time. Somehow it's fitting though.This is one that I think would reward a rewatch simply for all of its fine visual moments, both in big scenes like the platform over a cliff collapsing, and in little ones, like a peasant struggling to pull a donkey down the street in the background of a shot. There are countless others. Just a great film from Clouzot, and what a pairing it would make with the film he would make two years later, the brilliant Diabolique."
Æthelred,"Nov 14, 1999",6/10,"One can see how daring and original this movie must have been in 1953. Now, however, it comes across as dated and formulaic. In particular regarding its datedness, Yves Montand's brutish behavior toward his paramour seems stupid and sexist, and her fawning behavior toward him totally unrealistic, but I doubt their respective behaviors so appeared in 1953. Perhaps ""The Wages of Fear"" seems formulaic only because its formula has by now been copied countless times.  I did like all the languages I think I heard: English, French, Italian, German, Dutch, and of course Spanish. I gave it a ""6."""
dbdumonteil,"Feb 13, 2004",10/10,"A director of several terrific detective movies made in the forties such as ""le corbeau"" (1943), you can consider Henri Georges Clouzot as one of the best French film-makers specialized in suspense. Here, he broaches a new topic for him: the adventure movie with ""le salaire de la peur"" (1953) and this is a stunning movie.You can divide the movie into two obvious parts. The first one focuses on this bunch of men who lives in this Mexican small town cut disconnected from the world, even the time. If this part is a little uninteresting (but essential in the way that Clouzot emphasizes on their boredom and the mission to carry nitroglycérine with trucks to an oil well is an unexpected opportunity for them), on the other hand, the second part justifies the vision of the movie. When the four men have accepted the mission, they aren't out of the woods: there are a lot of dangerous situations where death can arrive at any moment. Clouzot manages to maintain the interest thanks to an asset whose he is the master: the suspense.A brilliant and absorbing movie still just as good as it was more than fifty years ago."
robert-temple-1,"Apr 13, 2010",6/10,"This film has a huge reputation, larger than it deserves, in fact. First of all, everyone likes and admires Clouzot as a director. Secondly, there has been a lot of affectionate admiration for Yves Montand over the decades. So the reverence shown to this particular film has been tinted with the rosy view of retrospection and skewed in favour of 'good old Clouzot' and 'good old Yves'. But the performance of the young Yves Montand in this film, while good, is not in any way remarkable, and the part could have been played just as well by any fifty other actors. In other words, the reputation of this film has been artificially inflated. In actuality, it is far inferior to many of Clouzot's other films. It is difficult to know why Clouzot even wanted to make such a strange and stressful film. It is extremely painful to watch, for almost every minute of screen time, and it is never enjoyable. Surely we all have enough problems in our lives without having to worry about people being blown up by nitroglycerine which they are driving in large trucks on pot-holed roads in a desert. Yes, the film has various creative shots and sequences: the shot where Montand jumps down onto some loose soil and it sprays all over the camera, the sequence of the waltz scene in the seedy bar near the end, especially as intercut with Montand's joyous driving antics. Those things are all touches of the master. But  and I repeat, but  but. WHY?? Once again I raise the question which I raise in numerous reviews of films by many directors who make needlessly unpleasant films: why would the director want to make this film? Surely some more worthwhile subject and project could have been chosen for that year of Clouzot's life. Why do directors time and again, apparently for reasons of vanity or perverted notions, make really disgusting films? Everyone in this film except for the pathetic simple-minded maid in the seedy bar is horrible and disgusting, lacking in any positive qualities of any kind. Not one has an iota of compassion or concern for anyone but himself, and most of them are greedy, selfish, violent, criminal, and utterly revolting. A great subject for a movie, then! The film is set in a kind of 'nowhere', which might be Mexico or might be Venezuela, in any case, a country where the rapacious American oil company called 'Southern Oil Company' drills for oil at the cost of the lives of the locals, many of whom are killed in the most horrible accidents, and no one gives a damn. The setting is so grim and forlorn that it is a real wrist-slasher of an experience just to see it on film. Everybody is starving, everybody is penniless, everybody is exploited, everybody is miserable. What a cheerful experience! There is a very touching scene in the film between Montand and a friend who is dying in his arms, when the dying man suddenly reminisces about Paris. For the entire film, Montand has pathetically saved and frequently shown to his friends the Paris Metro ticket from Pigalle station which he used the last time he left Paris. Now, the friend suddenly starts talking about the Rue Galande, a charming little street near the ancient churches of St. Severin and St. Julien le Pauvre. (Rue Galande is also very near the street where Elliott Paul lived, which he described in his famous novel 'The Last Time I Saw Paris', and its sequel.) Montand says he knows the street very well also, so together they discuss the various shops they knew, and they try to remember whether the fence is still there which had obstructed the view of what was inside. The friend says he never could see what was behind the fence. Montand says there was nothing behind it. The friend is distraught, and, looking into Eternity, says: 'So there is just nothing?' and dies. Certainly the director's attention to detail of the transportation of a volatile explosive in impossible conditions by men desperate for money creates fantastic tension, and is gruelling in the extreme. But I don't see why we should give a damn whether those men are blown up or not, frankly, as none of them is sympathetic, and it is difficult to see what difference it makes to the Greater Scheme of Things whether Peter van Eyck and Yves Montand make it or not in their life of hell in that place of hell. To call this film 'a bit of a downer' is a mammoth understatement. There are better ways to spend a couple of hours than watching this."
krisrox,"Jun 26, 2011",4/10,"In order to earn $ 2000, four men have to navigate two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin through a grueling terrain. Mistakes mean sudden death by explosion. It almost sounds like a modern reality TV concept, and yes, it's a great premise for a 1953 movie. The location (French Guyana, I suppose, but it could also be Venezuela) is fresh. In many ways, ""Le Salaire"" is a road and action movie avant la lettre. But someone has to take a stand and say it: this movie is terribly dated.Why is it dated? For one, the pacing is off. The movie drags and is about 40 minutes too long (and then I liked the long intro!). Second, the tension isn't managed up to modern standards. Clouzot is a great and innovative director, but many scenes are lacking in execution - you can often tell from a mile away what is going to happen. Third, it lacks appealing visuals. Many 40s and 50s movies have great black and white photography, but not this one, except some nice images towards the end.Finally, I thought the characters were poorly done. Yes, they are macho, and they are MEN. But we've known for a while that men like this don't really exist, something Humphrey Bogart had already found out in '42. ""Le Salaire"" is vaguely similar to ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", but while the latter excels in showing the dark side of humanity through evocative dialogue and timeless conflicts, the characters here left me utterly cold. Sorry."
howard.schumann,"Nov 4, 2002",N/A,"In the opening scene of Wages of Fear (1953), director Georges Henri-Clouzot provides  an inkling of the kind of claustrophobic ride we are in for. In a steamy, impoverished Latin American town called Las Piedras, insects grope clumsily in the dust, struggling to escape the strings that children have tied to them. People from all over the world congregate in the streets and bars and the air is thick with choking dust. Clouzot makes clear the desperation of the residents, ""It's like prison,"" explains one of them. ""Easy to get in, but escape is impossible."" The Southern Oil Company (SOC - same initials as Standard Oil) runs the town and enjoys its profits while the villagers are compelled to work odd jobs just to stay alive. After a fire breaks out at one of the oil fields killing many workers, the anti-union American boss seeks experienced drivers from among the townspeople to put out the fire. It is here that the anti-American flavor runs thick and where much of this part of the film was originally excised for American audiences (but has since been restored).Four men, desperate to escape their trap, agree to drive a truck loaded with nitroglycerine 300 miles over treacherous mountain roads in the hot sun for the sum of $2000 each. Transporting the nitroglycerine for them is a way out of hopelessness -- either through a big paycheck or through sudden death, with the latter appearing the more probable. Though sadly past the point in time when we can still be shocked over gangster capitalism and men selling out for money, the story is nonetheless compelling. The four who are chosen to go on this fool's errand include Mario, a young Corsican played by Yves Montand in a role that brought him widespread attention. He is carrying on an affair with a local servant girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot) who is in love with him. His treatment of her, however, is atrocious and reflects the attitude of the male-dominated society they live in. Also picked to drive one of the trucks is Jo, an aging Parisian small-time crook (Charles Vanel), Luigi (Folco Lulli), an Italian with less than a year to live, and an ex-nazi pilot (Peter van Eyck). This unlikely group will play a cat-and-mouse game with death for the remainder of the film.Clouzot depicts several incidents that bring the tension to the boiling point. In the first one, the trucks must travel at least 40 mph over a pot-holed stretch of road to prevent the vibrations from setting off the nitroglycerine. The second involves a sharp, narrow turn that requires the trucks to back up onto an unstable, rotten wooden platform causing it to buckle. Almost immediately afterwards, the trucks are stopped by a huge boulder in the middle of the road and must siphon off some of the nitroglycerine to blow it up. Finally, Mario must deftly maneuver the truck over a depression of spilled oil with the wheels stuck in reverse. As the long treacherous journey unfolds, roles are reversed between Mario and Jo as Mario becomes the strong dominant one and Jo, in Charles Vanel's brilliant performance, becomes shaken, fearful, and docile. Their relationship becomes the highlight of the film as the two become mutually dependent on each other for survival and comfort.I found Wages of Fear to be an involving experience that kept me riveted throughout, though I did sense that there would not be a two and a half-hour film unless somebody survived. Although the unexpected plot twists were gripping, the best part of the film for me was the revelation of each character when faced with fear. It reminded me of the ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", a film that also showed men discovering the truth about themselves and others while pursuing their dream of wealth. Wages of Fear lived up to its accolades, but for me the discordant ending clashed both with the tone of the film and with my experience of the universe not as arbitrary or capricious but as filled with meaning and purpose."
PWNYCNY,"Oct 10, 2010",10/10,"The movie starts off slowly but then rapidly accelerates. Yves Montand is brilliant in the lead role. Given his background as a singer, his performance is almost uncanny. The story is strong, compelling, simple yet profound. Men risk their lives and nobody really cares. Men reduced to scrounging will do just about anything to make a buck. This movie is about every deck hand, lineman, truck driver, construction worker and blue collar worker on this planet who makes a living by doing the hard, dirty, dangerous work that society still demands. Somebody has to do it. Four thousand years ago workers were hauling and lifting huge blocks of stones to build temples; the same work is being done today. These workers are taken for granted, forgotten until they are needed and then they are heroes, for the moment. This movie is a tribute to the courage of those whose work puts them in harms' way. This movie should be recognized for what it is: a director's personal statement about the condition of mankind, divided along class lines, the exploiters and the exploited, the indifference to human life in the quest for profits and how there are always those who come forward and do the heavy lifting, even when they know that they may not survive."
stavneg,"Sep 22, 1998",10/10,"This film runs along the traditional template of any story - a beginning, which unhurriedly and deliberately sets the scene, a middle section that carries the plotline, and a brief ending that resolves everything to no one's satisfaction. The beginning paints a picture of a world unimaginable to anyone from a developed country, of corruption, poverty, and oppression. It simultaneously describes the main characters - a bunch of immigrants who have strayed to this miserable little town, and for whom there is little chance of escape from the baking heat and unemployment. There is Mario, the happy-go-lucky scrounger, Luigi, his hard-working Italian pal, the comically tyranical tavern owner, his much abused maid, and Jo, the suave and dangerous French gangster. Homosexuality, racism, and the oppression of women figure prominently, but are never commented upon directly, as various prison motifs are evident in the lighting and set construction. Suddnly there is a change - a way out for a 'lucky' four of the deadbeats. There has been an explosion at an oil well on the other side of the mountain. The oil company needs to put out the fire with explosives, which are stored in the town. But its nitro-glycerine, and there is no time to get specially-fitted trucks to carry it over the rough mountains roads. Rather than risk their own employees, the oil company offers a large reward to four volunteers. Cue the action as first the men compete for the places on the two trucks, then as the winners embark on their terrifying journey, where every bump could spell instant death. On the journey their true characters emerge. One, Jo, is broken by the ordeal, but is eventually redeemed. 'How exciting could a simple road trip be?' you might ask, but the one and a half hour screen journey is petrifyingly spellbinding. Fate seems to be stacked against these bedraggled heroes, but it is their ingenuity, effort and bravery which captures our hearts. I won't reveal the details or the ending, which is tragic and some say its only flaw. It's in black and white, and mostly in French, but it will never be old-fashioned. The best film I have ever seen - and I've seen a few."
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Feb 14, 2008",10/10,"Wages of fear is a big lesson for action filmmakers who use a lot of technology but are largely unable to recreate an element of human sentiment in their action films.In all seriousness they can learn a lot from a great man who was more popular with his Gallic Hitchcock acronym :Henri Georges Clozot.In 1953,when he made this film,he did not even have one tenth of the kind of technology which is employed by today's technology savvy filmmakers.Wages of fear is a great film with existentialist undertones whose first half is a bitter depiction of nothingness for its four protagonists who languish in hot South America. It is in second half of the film that we witness a flurry of meaningful action.It is quite odd but due to heavy masculine presence Clouzot decided not to have much room for female characters except for a sensual role played by his wife Vera Clouzot.It is a true fact that before this film human misery,desperation and hopelessness were never shown in such vivid details as shown in this film.The sadness depicted in Wages of fear can still be felt in our contemporary world."
Rodrigo_Amaro,"Sep 5, 2013",9/10,"""Le Salaire de le Peur"" (""The Wages of Fear"") is a harrowing journey of four men going down in bumpy roads, miserable places, won over by the most difficult obstacles, a long way performing their jobs transporting a great load of dynamite to be used on a burning oil well. It's a job, it pays well, those guys are the best in it but it's a hard, dangerous and exhausting service that can cost their lives. All the way, almost like descending to hell. This is the road to hell. It's a story about the battle between courage and cowardice and how fear can take over even the bravest of souls. This is Henri-Georges Clouzot masterpiece along with the equally brilliant ""Les Diaboliques"", both featuring a tension that rises into an endless crescent that never leaves you at ease.I saw ""Sorcerer"" (the American remake), read Georges Arnaud's novel and watched this film. To me, they all stand on the same level. They're incredibly good, very exciting but they're not great. Arnaud focus more on the mission's perils rather than the characters and sometimes the story doesn't turn to other interesting possibilities; neither Clouzot or Friedkin films are the book, lacking of some of its good ideas but developing some new ones.""Sorcerer"" is an adventure about mercenaries looking for money and thrilling experiences while ""The Wages of Fear"" is a human drama about desperate people risking their lives to earn a living in the only possible way, and therefore more realistic than its remake.But Clouzot is a master in creating scary and real danger at practically every frame. A bar fight against local power man; the training closely observed by their patrons with conductors sabotaging each other; a truck making a difficult turn in a place that threats to collapse at any moment; the fear in the drivers eyes and hands, maneuvering as if each turn could be the last. The director delivers one of the most inspired and frightening moments of all time (not present in the book) when a giant stone stands on their way and the solution found to remove it to use part of the explosives. Heart couldn't handle very well that scene so perfectly made, with no soundtrack, very few dialogs and a constant action. And you relate very easily with the characters struggle, amazingly performed by Yves Montand (and I could never imagine him in such role, one of his earliest), Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli, similar in being all afraid of what they're doing but their fears are expressed in many different ways. Some panic, some control it, others disguise from time to time trying to look adventurous.The difficulties I had with this were the erratic and long introduction of each character, too many humored bits that weren't so effective (those could have been easily trimmed down) and the ending - not in the sense of being a let down but its goofy presentation seems awkward. The treatment given to the theme, the heart of the matter which is their mission and the rest (even the romance involving Montand and the girl, which is slightly distractive but useful) achieves a positive result. Certainly a movie of a different level and exciting even today. 21st Century flicks can only aspire to be something like this. Call me crazy, but Hollywood can even try again with a remake but this time read the novel, make wise choices and you might reach something similar or better. There's themes that can be explored in a very interesting way to make it a more challengeable film and adventurous. 9/10"
FilmMuscle,"Mar 5, 2020",6/10,"It's a solid adventure film but didn't do much for me beyond that. I'm not exactly sure why it's so highly rated on here, but there's always a classic that doesn't resonate as much as it does for others."
pdeany1234,"Jan 22, 2008",10/10,"In general I steer clear of foreign films, not just because I dislike reading subtitles, but also because I never feel as comfortable viewing them as I do films from my own culture. Perhaps I don't like to stretch myself as much as I should. I approached this film with trepidation. From the first second of this film I was absolutely absorbed into the world it created - a world dominated by desperate men from disparate cultures trapped in a sordid backwater. Without money, passports and marketable skills, they spend their time indulging in drunkenness, indifferent sex and mindless violence until they are offered an escape through a trial by fire, survivor takes all and the chances of survival are slim indeed. Wages of Fear provides the ultimate in suspense, character development, physical and psychological action. It is a visual masterpiece, not because of the beauty it displays but because of the complexity, depth and darkness of the world it portrays. It reminds me so much of Treasure of the Sierra Madres, an examination of courage and character under the most dire circumstances. A wonderful feature of this film -- there is absolutely no background music which increases the reality and suspense because the viewer cannot anticipate the action. You get to sweat and tremble along with the characters as they drive over washboard roads and crumbling mountain paths. The acting is superb, and this from a person who has in the past dismissed Yves Montand as a frivolous song and dance man. Highly recommended."
EdgarST,"Nov 7, 2015",6/10,"«Le salaire de la peur» has not aged very well. In spite of the fact that the solid performances by the four leading actors and Armand Thirard's cinematography remain effective (and in spite of the criteria of the Criterion company, which has become some sort of ""film Bible"" for many unbaptized in the immensely wide scope of world cinema), the flaws are more evident now. To start with the 39- minute first act is quite hard to follow, especially for a Spanish- speaking person like me: in the novel the action takes place in Guatemala (Central America) , but where does this movie take place, where is this place called Las Piedras that by 1953 still has creoles talking with Spaniards' accents, where indigenous dress as Andean people or undress like Amazonian tribes? The closest town to Las Piedras seems to be Caracas (capital of Venezuela, South America) as seen in a sign of plane fares, or it could be Tegucigalpa (capital of Honduras, Central America) according to a dialog: you take your pick. All this mishmash is possible, yes, but at least I could not deal with the endless parade of offensive ""Latino"" stereotypes, from the taxi driver who stops his car precisely in the middle of a mud pond, the barefoot venal black immigrant officer or the sweaty and greasy owner of ""El Corsario Negro"". Then take act two, which as Georges Arnaud's novel is also the weakest dramatic section of the movie, since the characters have been well established in the first act. So this is mainly a block of action sequences in which the nitroglycerin-loaded trucks go from one obstacle to the next, to reach their goal, the oil field in flames. Admittedly a couple of the pieces are real gems (the long sequence of the rotten-wood platform or the solution to take a huge boulder out of the road), but it is just that, a chain of obstructions and how to deal with them. The last act centers on the persistence of the two surviving truck drivers, leading to a surprise ending that seems too moralistic after everything we have seen before, when all the characters we have seen since the beginning deserve a similar conclusion. As for the critic of American companies in foreign lands, today that is no news and it can also be said of European and Asian enterprises in those alien territories, as well as the local companies: they all give similar ruthless treatment to workers (and the land itself). This is the kind of commercial ""macho movie"" that asks for a remake among the action film crowd. There have been a couple of those and a few imitations, the more remarkable being William Friedkin's «Sorcerer» (1977), in which he wisely reduced the running time from the original 142 minutes to 121."
aafine,"Jan 3, 2001",10/10,"The first time I saw this amazing film I was first fascinated by the photography, the locale, the development of the all-too-human characters, and as the plot thickened I became glued to my seat, then wriggling with the unbearable suspense. After it's all over, you're left with a lot more than a sigh of relief--it leaves you thinking, and you remember the characters as if you knew them. One of the top ten movies I've ever seen for its ruthless existentialism coupled with pure entertainment value. The second time I saw it it was....almost as good."
davidmvining,"Jan 17, 2025",10/10,"His previous film, Miquette, being a financial disappointment, Henri-Georges Clouzot finally returned to the world of suspense after a two film break. The Wages of Fear, based on a novel by Georges Arnaud, is Clouzot's most hopeless and technically well-crafted film, a marvel of suspense and tension that stretches simple events to the breaking point. Four men facing nature down in search of a victory to get them out of the unnamed Central American nation where they've found themselves trapped for their past sins, The Wages of Fear was probably what Hitchcock was thinking of when he considered Clouzot his only real rival in the realm of suspense in cinema.Mario (Yves Montand) is a bum in the remote outpost designed to cater to the workers of the Southern Oil Company, SOC. He can't get work, aside from the occasional odd job, and spends most of his time lounging outside in the heat on the porch of the bar run by Hernandez (Dario Moreno) while teasing his girl, Linda (Vera Clouzot), Hernandez's barmaid. He has a roommate, an Italian named Luigi (Folco Lulli), who works cement. There's also a German, Bimba (Peter van Eyck). Into this world comes Jo (Charles Vanel), a criminal of money who had to leave it all behind when he swiftly had to flee France. They're all stuck in a place they hate with no work and no way out. And then, opportunity arises.Mr. O'Brien (William Tubbs) informs the community of a situation 300 miles away at their oil wells. A fire has broken out, and they require the nitroglycerin stored at the outpost to put it out. He wants to hire four men to drive two trucks through the wilds. Of course, our four main characters get selected (though Jo needs to ""convince"" someone else to drop out), and they're off.The first half hour is the introduction to the characters. The next thirty minutes is the introduction to the situation. And the final 90 minutes or so is the mission itself, four men put into the pressure cooker of a situation, death tailing them a few feet behind their heads, waiting for an errant bump to go off, and all of them already nearly at each other's throats before things even begin.It's like a submarine movie, but out in the open with Southern France standing in for Central America, and I do have affection for submarine movies.What I find interesting about the suspense is how infrequently the suspense actually breaks. I seem to have this assumption that we need to see how the suspense can break from time to time, but Clouzot makes mincemeat of that half-formed idea in the back of my mind. Explosions are not hard to understand, and even though we don't see many explosions in the film, the sense of tension never subsides once the four men get on the road. Things get amped up in different ways, namely through interpersonal developments like Mario discovering that Jo is actually a coward and can barely function even from the start. This combines with the natural barriers from the degradation of the state of the road from paved near the outpost to increasingly dominated by jungle and rocks as they go. They need to navigate Nature and each other to come up with solutions, all with the nitro just behind their heads.The appeal comes from the individual sequences, bridged between them by the character work that Clouzot began the film with. There's the moment each truck in succession needs to make a perilous turn, backing up onto a rickety wooden platform over a cliff, the first making the platform deteriorate further before the second even shows up. There's a huge rock that blocks the road with no way around it that needs to get dealt with. There's a broken oil pipeline that starts to flood a small depression in the road that will get the trucks stuck if they stop at all (which, I mean, they do).And underneath all this marvelous tension is just...hopelessness. It had been a long time since I'd seen Clouzot's original, and I've seen Sorcerer, Friedkin's remake, rather recently. I had an understanding that things wouldn't be cheery, but I kind of thought that Friedkin's 70s take would be much more nihilistic than Clouzot's. And that's not really the case. When one character is dying, his previous conversation being about an empty lot behind a store in Paris and his final words are ostensibly about that lot and he yells, ""There's nothing!"", well, there's something hopeless about it all. When the mission is done and in the middle of a cross-cutting celebration it all just comes to an abrupt end, there's something being said about the pointlessness of the struggle.There's a certain anti-imperialist messaging to the film which probably feeds into that, but I think it's a bit incoherent. Anti-imperialist words coming from Europeans in a Central American country against Americans for demanding work of them to escape the place they escaped to feels...random. The film's focus is more of a man vs. Nature thing, but the underlying anti-imperialism that's a bit too polemic in the beginning to be swept away as just the kind of dialogue these kinds of guys might say. It's a criticism of the film, really my only one and one that's quickly forgotten once the journey starts. However, it does add to the overall sense of powerlessness of these four men as they struggle to find a way out of the hell that they've placed themselves in.If forced to choose between the two versions, I think I slightly prefer Friedkin's. It's a tad more cohesive narratively and with a more dangerous feel to nature (actually filming in the South American jungle helped). However, that's not a diminishment of Clouzot's original work. It's a great entertainment that pushes the audience almost as far as it pushes its characters."
kthelonius,"Dec 9, 2005",10/10,"On the short list of best films ever made. One of those films that you get so wrapped up in you forget you're watching a film. The acting is superb and the cinematography first-rate. I love the shot near the beginning of the film where Linda is crawling across the floor to Mario, soft light from outside playing across her body, breasts partially exposed; he fondles her hair sorta petting her like a dog or cat. A perfectly crafted short little sequence that explains their relationship and perhaps Mario's attitude toward women in general better than pages of prose ever could. But the movie is really about the struggle for existence in an unforgiving world where any display of cowardice costs your claim to manhood, and as such, the action and suspense scenes are among the most finely crafted in cinema history. If you're a fan of international cinema, SEE THIS FILM!! BTW, the Criterion Collection edition is first-rate."
elvircorhodzic,"Nov 1, 2016",10/10,"THE WAGES of FEAR is a cruel and sarcastic approach a existential thriller. The director plays with human psychology, whereas the protagonists travel through without hope and seek salvation. The action takes place around the four drivers who in two trucks transporting nitroglycerin at a great distance through the South American jungle, but the roads are full of potholes and obstacles which is very problematic because their cargo is very sensitive and can explode at the slightest impact.In the first third of the film develops the somewhat perverse drama in an isolated town where poverty is visible at every step. This part creates the necessary atmosphere and character development. Relationship between the protagonists are not explained. Each one acts on impulse and in their own way to cope with the agony brought by poverty and unemployment. As rescue appears cruel form of economic and corporate imperialism.On one side is a fear and hostility by the local population (cheap labor) to the oil company. For Europeans who live there, jobs, no matter how dangerous it was, the rescue or escape from the everyday agony. Then comes the sudden turn in a story that gets qualities of existential and adventurous thriller.Excitement, tension, danger and ice uncertainty.This is a strange blend of action and human reactions. The path of salvation through a nightmare. This approach awakens the worst and the best in man. The lack of sentimentality has contributed to the reality of the experience. This is a harsh struggle for survival.I wondered whether the protagonists actually brave, or just desperate and hopeless. End of the film did not need to be so ironic. Well, probably it was a low blow to the Hollywood thriller.Yves Montand as Mario is brave and ruthless character. In the end, his madness cost him life. Charles Vanel as Jo is a former gangster at all costs trying to flee the city. It's too dangerous to work and quite a coward when push comes to shove. I would not say that his life is more valuable. Peter van Eyck as Bimba is a character who does not have a specific goal in life. If he survives the accident would not have known what later. Very resourceful character in desperate situations. Folco Lulli as Luigi is diligent and cheerful man. He is faced with disease and in dangerous job offer see only salvation. Véra Clouzot as Linda is incredibly beautiful and pretty maid. A faithful lover. Enjoy the woman while she cleans floors is humiliating, but this scene is the responsibility of the atmosphere and theme of the film.Every little bump, blow or elevated tone in this film stops the heart."
ma-cortes,"Jul 12, 2020",7/10,"Splendid and famous movie by Henry-Georges Clouzot and remade by William Friedkin as ¨Sorcerer¨ in 1977 . Dealing with four distressed men (Yves Montand , Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck) who undertake a risked journey throughout the Amazon jungle by transporting a hazardous cargo . As an American company : ¨Southern Oil Company¨ controls a desolate Central American town whose citizens desperately want money to live , so desperately that four are willing to attempt a suicide mission to deliver nitroglycerine to put out a well-fire raging 300 miles away . As the company's cynical head has offered 2000 dollars to each man , enough to finance theit getaway from the hell-hole they live in .Exciting and thrilling movie which so entrapped us in following the misfortunes of the four men desperate enough to undertake a suicidal journey with a cargo of nitroglycerine along the dangerous jungle and cliffside roads . Multi-dimensional , twisted and complex drama concentrates on character development for the first half . The film contains nail-biting scenes as the cliff frames when a truck is hooked or the petroleum hole , crucial to the movie's greatness . Main role is grittily played by Yves Montand giving a wonderful acting . The remainder of the roles remain perfectly developed such as Charles Vanel , Folco Lulli , Peter Van Eyck and special appearance by Vera Clouzot , George Clouzot's wife .It packs a strirring and moving musical score by Georges Auric . As well as evocative and atmospheric black/white cinematography shot on location by cameraman Armand Thirard and in a finely restored version . The motion picture based on a novel written by Georges Arnaud was competently directed by Henry Georges Clouzot . He started his film career as a screenwriter and then Henri-Georges Clouzot switched over to directing in 1942 with Tout pour l'amour and The Murderer Lives at Number 21 . His films are typically relentless suspense thrillers , similar to Alfred Hitchcock's but with far less light relief . He had the distinction of having his film The craven (1943) prohibited by both the German forces occupying France and the Free French forces fighting them, but for different reasons . He shot to international fame with Jenny Lamour (1947) and especially Wages of fear (1953) and consolidated that success with other films as Race for Life (1956) , Les espions (1957) , La prisonnière (1968) . He beat Alfred Hitchcock in buying the rights to ""Les Diaboliques""(1955) with a margin of just a few hours , but continuous ill health caused large gaps in his output , and several projects had to be abandoned until his death . Rating : 7.5/10 . Better than average . And it had a good remake by William Friedkin with Roy Scheider , Bruno Cremer , Francisco Rabal and Amidou."
Karl Self,"Dec 21, 2008",8/10,"What can I say -- this is a fairly simple but excellent movie that has become a classic and is rightly considered must-see viewing by many movie buffs. And as far as existentialism goes, it's a lot more fun to watch this than to read one of Sartre's brain hemorrhagers. The plot is super-simple -- a bunch of pennyless adventurers are hired to drive two trucks loaded with nitroglycerine to a drilling site where it is desperately needed to blow out a fire. It's essentially like Smokey And The Bandit, only with nitrogylcerine instead of beer. Beat that, Burt Reynolds.The characters come across as realistic and intriguing, though not necessarily as terribly affable. I particularly liked Peter von Eyck as Bimba the German. The only scene I didn't like was when they had to back up their lorries onto a bridge-like construction ending over an abyss, because I thought it was contrived and overly dramatic.I've heard from two persons who saw this back in the day when it came out, one said that they almost couldn't bear the tension, the other that it changed their perspective through its bleak existentialism. I'm just remarking this to give you an idea how this movie was originally received.Finally, they really did a good job of making the South of France look like South America!"
Theo Robertson,"May 12, 2015",6/10,"Considered to be a classic of French cinema and currently ranked at number 165 on the IMDb Top 250 I went in to THE WAGES OF FEAR with very high expectations especially since the version I was going to watch was the director's cut running at almost two and a half hours . After seeing it I have to admit I felt rather disappointed by itThere's a good story at the core . A handful of men are paid by an oil company to transport nitroglycerin through a South American jungle . Nitroglycerin as you might know is a highly volatile explosive substance . Shake it about then it's BOOM BANG and there's not enough of you left to have a proper funeral , only a memorial service . If you don't know this don't worry because there's a scene where someone points out how dangerous nitro is . This does lead to the question if it's so dangerous then why use it ? Surely dynamite is a much more stable explosive for putting out oil fires . As it turned out I consulted Wikipedia and indeed nitroglycerin is the explosive of choice for putting out oil fires and has been ever since oil fires have happened . I guess you have to overlook otherwise there wouldn't be a storyThe problem is there just isn't enough of a story justifying a film lasting two and a half hours . The first half hour is taken up with introducing the characters and everything moves with a slow languid pace . Then after that we get to the story proper of men driving trucks with a highly explosive cargo down bumpy third world dirt tracks . Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does very well in convincing us the action is taking place in South America when in fact it was filmed entirely in France but I didn't think he achieved much else . For a story involving characters whose lives could end in a blink of an eye at any moment there's a singular lack of tension , I know it's not the fault of the director but the version I saw had some dodgy subtitles where when characters speak English the words appearing on screen aren't matching what is being said by the characters which led me to wonder if the French and Spanish translations are also similarly mistranslated . Regardless of that point I still felt short changed by THE WAGES OF FEAR"
Bronco46,"Oct 13, 2011",1/10,"There is nothing here to waste any portion of your life on. The only reason I bothered to get to the end of this muddled mess was, I was putting together a piece of furniture so I had a distraction from this story. The other reason I stuck it out to the end was I was curious how this could get a four star review from Turner Classic Movies. The story line itself makes little sense, and the adventures these men have a ridiculous contrivances. The first forty five minutes of the movie are just there to establish that these are bunch of down and out men who would do anything for money; a lot of the interactions between the characters are silly, and add little or nothing to this story. After that they have a series of adventures that make little or no sense. Things that no one would do, things that are not possible, and things that would be just plain stupid to do. There are just to many things to outline here. I would not recommend watching this film unless you want to see a stunningly poorly written story line. I am at compete loss as to how so many people have given this a good review. The only thing dumber then the story line is the ending of this film; like the rest of the film it makes no sense; no one would do what this guy does. Since this film is bad on so many levels I can't outline them all here. Your going to have to decide if you want to waste nearly two hours of your life, on something this bad."
fowler1,"Aug 16, 2001",N/A,"This movie has two flaws. The first is some of the logic is screwy; the second is the oilman O'Brien is not a character, he's a grotesque anti-American caricature, in sharp contrast to the beautifully limned characterizations of the protagonists. Neither of these flaws make a whit of difference in my reaction to this film. THE WAGES OF FEAR is all the things others have claimed: an action-packed suspense classic with a strong existential flavor. But, first and foremost, it is a masterful MOVIE. When you watch WAGES as an example of storytelling on film, there isn't a wasted second or a wrong step. The 'slow' first half in the hot little village is never less than exhilirating...you can smell the stale, moist air and taste the salt of your own sweat after an hour of Clouzot's detailed, swooning-from-the-humidity immersion of the audience into this hellish purgatory: by the time O'Brien is looking for drivers, you know exactly why these men are so desperate to risk death to get out. (One man, denied the job, commits suicide; another, who did get the job, may have been murdered by one of our 'heroes'.)The long, long journey they must travel to get their $2000 is unforgettable: every emotion, every frayed nerve-end is exposed during the ordeal. We see these men at their most elemental and vicious and cowardly...but we also see their incredible nobility and love later - when they have gone so far beyond turning back that their hope, their dignity and courage are the only things they have left to combat their fear and despair. Even though none of these things matter when a hard bump on the road will immolate saint and sinner alike, they become the only things that matter; it's a beautiful, timeless message for a film to contain. Those moments in WAGES where we see the men at their best (the scene where Luigi is discovered alive after the blast, Montand's comforting the dying Vanel at journey's end) are even more indelible and affecting than the noirish scenes of the men falling apart from stress - and THOSE are considerably powerful. Remade for no earthly reason I can discern, and another example of how superior French films before the Nouvelle Vague were to those that followed. Godard, Truffaut, Resnais: none of them ever made a film  approaching the power or beauty of CHILDREN OF PARADISE, FORBIDDEN GAMES, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or this movie. Essential viewing."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 28, 2010",10/10,"After wading through the early exposition, I settled into this film and found it to be about as tense as any I've seen. The people in the small village are literally in prison. We even see a shot of the shadows off a trellis superimposing prisoner's stripes on the people who pretty much wait for something to happen. When a job opportunity arises when an oil company needs men to drive truckloads of nitroglycerin to a fire site, they arise from their sloth and head into an encounter with hell. This is so much more than a simple adventure. We begin to be fascinated by each of the characters as well as the peripheral ones. We root for them and die with them. When one of them turns cowardly, we understand the kinds of forces that are working on him. When one of the trucks eventually blows up, it appears as a flash and little puff. How delicate are our lives. There are different kinds of escape and these people embrace their chance. The wages of fear are 2000 dollars, not much for a man's life, but creates adventure. The performances are outstanding as well as the pacing and first impressions don't mean much when people are all on the same plane."
aimless-46,"Oct 10, 2006",10/10,"30 years ago while stationed in England I caught the last half hour of ""Wages of Fear"" on BBC. Although I did not know the name of the film, it made such a favorable impression that I kept looking for it once I got back to the world; but it was never shown on American television. When William Friedkin made ""Sorcerer"" I was able to connect the dots and put a title to my elusive film.In many ways Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a bridge between the Italian Neorealism of the early 1950's and the French New Wave of a few years later. Even more obvious is its link to early Hollywood Renaissance directors Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Stanley Kubrick. Peckinpah pays homage to ""Wages of Fear"" with a similar introductory scene in ""The Wild Bunch"" and again in ""Straw Dogs"". Kubrick does it with ""The Blue Danube"" waltz in ""2001"", juxtaposing exterior shots of the moving space station with interior views of the stewardess serving a passenger (just as Clouzot cut between the truck cruising down the road and the party back in town). Penn was a little less obvious but the violent shifts between comedy and tragedy in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" can be traced back to a similar narrative technique in ""The Wages of Fear"".Most of the criticism about ""The Wages of Fear"" comes because Neorealism presents a more stylized reality than classic Hollywood narrative. The intent is to bring the ordinary features of the world into better focus by exaggeration. Expressionistically imitating reality while announcing that what is being shown is not real, the belief being that the more real the imitation the more fraudulent. Thus the use of narrative techniques that actually call attention to themselves. So the process of Jo (Charles Vanel) becoming a hero to Mario (Yves Montand) is shown through a montage of brief disjointed moments of connection. And Mario's journey from idolizing Jo to disillusionment and back to idolizing is much the same.Jo, Mario, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are desperate men stranded somewhere in South America (probably Venezuela). They need money to escape so when an American oil company offers $4,000 to each pair of drivers willing to transport a ton of nitroglycerin (300 kilometers over poor roads) to a burning wellhead, they sign on for the job. Death could happen at any moment and the reactions of each man along the journey is compared and contrasted with what the viewer learned about them back in the village during the first half of the film. There is a certain foreshadowing as it is pointed out at the start that this is the kind of intense task where even the survivors will be permanently scarred emotionally.The four are not heroes, just a mixed group linked by a willingness to value themselves at only $2,000. The oil company (an American one) is able to operate in this remote region because there is plenty of manpower who share this mindset. The film is more anti- capitalist than anti-American and whatever political message it had in 1953 is more generic today.The cinematographer, Armand Thirard, keeps things claustrophobic throughout; in the dead- end town and in the cab of each truck.Clouzot sets up his most suspenseful sequence, where the trucks must back up on the unstable wooden platform in order to get around a hairpin bend, by having the first (smaller) truck narrowly succeed, heightening the tension as the bigger truck attempts the same maneuver.What establishes this as European art cinema is its willingness to break primary film conventions. Clouzot was free from the need for a happy ending and could let anything happen to his characters. Conventional narrative required that a character's narrow escape early in the film was because he had a purpose later in the story, but that is not the case with ""Wages of Fear"". You first realize the power this gives Clouzot when a stray rock rolls down a hillside toward a Jerry can filled with nitro. In this film such an ironic anticlimax is actually a real possibility.If you liked the original ""Flight of the Phoenix"" you will enjoy this film. And if you are a Peckinpah fan it is a must watch.Then again, what do I know? I'm only a child."
writers_reign,"Feb 27, 2004",10/10,"In the Forum des Images in Paris in addition to the regular screenings and irregular previews, lectures, etc the movie buff can also enter a room containing about two dozen monitors, each supplied with its own keyboard and armchair with built-in speakers. Here the buff can choose to view one of the more than 6,500 titles available. There is, however, one proviso; every title, be it silent or sound, black and white or color, documentary of feature is either set in or has a strong connection with Paris. Selection is up to the individual, theoretically it can be alphabetical if one had the time to scan 6,500 titles. The usual method is to key in the name of an actor, director, writer and/or a genre. When one keys in Yves Montand and qualifies further by adding 'fiction' there is a choice of around ten titles and these include Le Salaire de la puer, which by now everyone knows takes place in South America despite being shot in the South of France. When I brought this to the attention of a staffer it was explained to me that Mario - the character played by Montand - carries around a ticket for the Paris metro. Viewers of this classic tend to carry around for years afterward a mental phial of nitro, such is the impact it has on initial screening. It is impossible to praise too highly the taut script and direction, the just-right acting of slow-starter Montand (after a few brief appearances mostly as himself in pot-boilers he took a beating in his first starring role and concentrated on filling Domestic and International stages with his singing. Even after this triumph it was almost a further decade before he really got into his acting stride via Compartiment tuer. In their wisdom both video and DVD distributors often pair this with the same director's equally definitive 'Les Diaboliques featuring Mrs Montand, Simone Signoret (and again the director's other half, Vera Clouzot). This is an unbeatable parlay and should be snapped up by anyone with even a peripheral interest in what makes good movies. As for this. Magnifique! 10/10"
inframan,"Jul 9, 2001",10/10,"I too believe that this is one of the greatest films of all time, ranking right up there with Citizen Kane & Les Enfants du Paradis & Grapes of Wrath. It has the majestic sweep & the scope & the deep sense of human tragedy that those films have. I don't feel it's a ""suspense"" film, it's much much more. It's a metaphor of the struggle to survive that is shared by every human being ever born. I have no problems with the symbolic images & acts that open & close the film: the cockroach ""dance"" & Mario's last drive. They too are metaphors which would be digestable if such metaphors weren't so out of favor these days. Particularly, the ending: who doesn't believe deep down that when one struggles to keep death at arm's length, one has a chance to postpone it, but if you forget & celebrate your luck, chances are your time has arrived. If I have any problems at all, it's with the casting of Vera Clouzot. She's too immaculately refined & happy-go-lucky for someone in her situation. She certainly doesn't seem to mind the trip up the stairs with the bozo boss. This was the one thing about Wages of Fear that made me think of Hollywood (particularly John Ford). But everything else about this film is so brilliant that its small flaws are easily forgiven. By the way, in the last 30+ years I have seen versions with both the first 40 minutes & the last 15 excised! Abominable!! God bless those responsible for making this version available."
contronatura,"Feb 26, 2000",9/10,"If there's one element that keeps this film going it's tension. After we are introduced to the characters in the setting of the small South American village, the film turns into one of the most gripping adventure stories ever. There's a scene where the characters have to get a rock out of the road in front of them that is so tense I was literally white-knuckled. This film will inevitably be compared to the remake by William Friedkin, Sorceror. That is an inferior film, if only because it has a very clunky sets of character introductions and relies too much on the physical mechanics of the journey and not the characters. The Wages of Fear is all about the characters and the situations that arise due to their greed and hubris. Perhaps the most chilling scene of all is a decision Yves Montand's character has to make while driving across an oily pond. It's scene like that one that make the film great. This is Clouzot's best film in my opinion, just edging out Diabolique. Find it and see it."
vg40,"Jul 23, 2018",6/10,"The first hour is so boring, the film goes nowhere. It is demeaning to women at times. The actions starts too late but holds your attention once it does. Most people including the protagonist are evil in this one and ends appropriately. Overall a letdown."
MrETrain,"Sep 29, 1999",10/10,"I had been hunting this one down for a while until I managed to get my hands on a copy. Luckily it was the original director's cut and not the edited American version. I went into this movie with extremely high expectations and I was not disappointed in the least. The performances were uniformly excellent. I was drawn in by Mario's unfailing tenacity as much as I was repulsed by his willingness to commit a reprehensible act in his drive to accomplish the mission (see the movie to see what I mean). I sympathized with Jo, who, although a whiner and coward, was the wisest of the bunch.The cinematography is alternately beautiful and bleak, capturing the graveness of the situation wonderfully. The oil slick scene is amazing. The tension builds to almost agonizing levels, and then goes a bit further. I'm a Hitchcock fan, but I don't think Hitch ever directed anything that reaches the level of suspense of The Wages of Fear.People have said that they thought the introduction went on too long, but I'd have to disagree. The long introduction serves to firmly establish the characters and give weight to their actions. The full 148-minute version is the one to see if you enjoy strong character development, but the 131-minute version is available for those with less patience.And yes, there is not a happy ending. Some might say it was a letdown. I admit to feeling that way for a minute or two until I started replaying the movie in my mind (and this is a movie that stays with you, guaranteed). I came to appreciate the bleak ending, and in fact, relish it. I found it to be--and I believe that this was the director's intention-- just desserts."

mjneu59,"Jan 14, 2011",10/10,"Four desperate outcasts in a seedy tropical village volunteer to drive a pair of trucks loaded with volatile nitroglycerin over unpaved mountain roads to a remote oil field, where a well is burning out of control. Henri-Georges Clouzot's stark, pessimistic adventure contains enough pure suspense to pull any viewer to the edge of a seat, but until 1992 the film had never been seen (at least in this country) in its uncut, original form. Before it was first released, scissor-happy censors trimmed nearly 45-minutes of footage (mostly from the early, introductory scenes) to help soften the strong anti-American subtext, but even in the truncated version the bias must have been obvious. American oil (and the need to keep it flowing) is still the monument under which every character is ultimately buried, a point made explicit when one driver is crushed beneath his truck in a pool of crude. The director's restored cut is even is incredibly downbeat (note the vultures hovering over every other scene), but the film still packs a thrilling, unforgettable punch."
andyman618,"Apr 23, 2004",10/10,"The Wages Of Fear is a damn near perfect suspense thriller. The story concerns four men, broke, desperate, and stranded in a small town somewhere in South America (Venezuela, I presume). They are offered a way out of their miserable existence when an oil well catches fire three hundred miles away and the oil company needs four men to drive the nitroglycerin to the site to blow it out. The trouble is that the three hundred miles they have to drive is some of the most rugged, hostile terrain imaginable.The tension and suspense is palpable during the driving scenes, but what takes this movie to a whole other level is that it takes the time to familiarize the audience with these men. We feel like we know them, and sympathize with them before the journey starts. The whole cast is great and believable, and it wasn't long before I truly forgot I was watching actors in a fictional film. These men made it real, as did the brilliant direction of Henri-Georges Clouzot.Clouzot's style is gritty and realistic, with cuts between the trucks and close-ups of their actions (hands on the shift lever, feet on the pedals, etc) serving to heighten the tension. The lack of a musical score also lends a sense of realism and helps to bring home the sense of loneliness and isolation felt by these men.Highly recommended."

It is so simple and yet so tense with incredible ending that you simply must love it.I also watched Friedkin's ""Sorcerer"" but that adaptation of same novel never hit me like this gem.I highly recommend it to everybody who want to experience tension in true meaning of that word ...10/10"
tammy_driscoll,"Jul 5, 2002",10/10,"This is what film making is all about.  This movie combines unique character development, a great script and direction, with entertaining and suspenseful scenes.  This is definitely my favorite movie.  This is one that even if you do not love, EVERYONE is guaranteed to like."
Mahuno,"Sep 2, 1999",10/10,"""Wages of Fear""   is without doubt a true classic - a film you can watch again and again.  Four desperate men on a journey that will reveal their true character as every turn in the road brings a new challenge to test their mettle.  This film is so good that avid fan such as myself derives as much pleasure from watching first timers viewing it as from seeing it again myself.  The suspense is such that their faces cannot but contort and wince in anticipation, their eyes as big as dinner plates are absolutely riveted to the screen as the action unfolds.  The tension in this film is palpable so check your pace maker before pushing the 'Play' button.  By the way, it is an ambition of mine to track down the location of the scene where the trucks back out on to the platform.  I simply cannot depart this earth without having stood on that very spot.  Can anyone help?  I believe some of the scenes were shot in Venezuela and others in El Salvador.  Any leads would be most appreciated"
JayWolfgramm,"Jul 3, 2025",6/10,"I'll get the two main problems out of the way. First is the beginning. The movie centers around four characters, Mario, Luigi, Jo and Bimba transporting nitroglycerine. The idea of delivering the nitroglycerine isn't brought up until 40 minutes into the movie, and they don't start their drive until the hour mark of the film. The time before that is spent introducing us to a couple of the characters. This wouldn't be a dealbreaker if it wasn't for problem #2, Mario, and especially Jo, are jerks. All the introduction does is make me hope that they get blown up.Once that part of the story is out of the way, the movie does a great setting up some suspenseful scenes and ratcheting up the tension. The intro, as much as I criticized the character set up, does establish a desperation for the situation. You believe that these characters would take a life-or-death job for $2000.Much like the journey of the characters, it may be painfully slow at times, but it leads to some great moments."
getsmartoc,"Aug 13, 2018",1/10,"Just watched this out of date, over acted piece of utter nonsense. What on Earth are all these other reviews talking about? Did we watch the same movie?There are ""real"" classics out there, one's from the same period that dated well, showed the period and the issues of the day and dealt with them in a real and honest way...and then there these are ""arty"" classics that just go and over do the story, the dialogue and the characters to...well, I don't know why they do it but I can say that I don't get why they do ""it"". This must be an arty classics because I just didn't get ""it"" and I don't understand the people that have watched this in the last 40 years and pretended to get ""it"" as well. 
There is nothing real about this movie, the story is passable, okay, but there is no insight into the time or place of the movie, the dialogue is plain ridiculous, and the casting is terrible...(did anyone look at, and understand, who/what Linda's character was supposed to be in the first 5 minutes of the movie? She was badly cast and then given a terrible role to play on top of that). Vanel's transition from tough old street thug to corny coward was...well, it was hilarious actually (that was a source of a few laughs, truth be told). I think only O'Brien Luigi and Bimba are well played and we get saved the silly dialogue of the others with these characters. Mario was...such a shallow and repulsive character to me that I won't even go into how out-dated this kind of ""hero"" is in this day and age.
Who should want to watch this movie? Those that want to see what being ""cool"" meant to a man in the 50's and how women (and a really beautiful one at that) where/should be treated by such macho men like Mario (this is a real women beater's showcase here). All in all a rubbish movie and if I could have those two and a half hours back I would surely ask."
eibon09,"Feb 14, 2001",N/A,Le Salaire de la Peur/The Wages of Fear(1953) is a psycological and tense masterpiece of the French cinema.  It bridges the gap between the pre war films and films of the French New Wave.  The story is excellently done and the scenes during the middle part of the film is shown with hand trembling suspense.  The Wages of Fear(1953) as with Jean Pierre Melville's Bob Le Flambeur(1954) and Jules Dassin's Rififi(1955) are a few fine examples of some great Film Noir pictures to come out of France during the 1950s.The Wages of Fear(1953) introduced a new and exciting actor by the name of Yves Montand.  This is the motion picture that made him an international star and would make him into one of French cinema's best leading actors.  He does an outstanding job in projecting macho qualities as well as qualities of concern in the role of Mario.  The most interesting scenes are the ones with him and fellow actor Charles Vanel.The direction of the movie is done with total perfection.  Henri Georges Clouzot does a terrific job in handling the suspense scenes.  He also does a good job in setting those scenes up.  From watching this film I come to know that I am watching the work of an artist.I love the cinematography of The Wages of Fear(1953).  The cinematography is helped out by some smooth editing on part of the people who made this film. The camera work increases the suspense and triples the tension that is felt between the main characters.  The cinematography glides like an angel and flows like clouds.The main villains in the movie are the Oil company that employs the four main characters.  The scenes with the Oil Company was cut when first released here because because of its negative portrayal of the American oil company.  These scenes have been since restored on DVD.  I can see why these scenes where cut because they give the film an anti-American flavor.Its a great film because it has all that is important to cinema work well. The relationship between Mario and Jo is very similar with the relationship of the two women in Les Diaboliques(1955).  Henri Georges Clouzot was known then as The French Hitchcock and for good reason.  It has a very sad surprise ending with some good music.Le Salaire de la Peur(1953) along with Les Diaboliques(1955) are unfortuately only a handful of film that the director is known for.  He was not a popular film maker because of the themes dealt with in Le Corbeau(1943).  He is an underrated movie maker and is worthy of a retroprospective series from some film theater because he deserves it.  The Wages of Fear(1953) would have a big impact on the making of films like Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch(1969) and John Woo's A Better Tomorrow(1986).

However once they start their treacherous journey, Jo gets the shakes and is frightened. It is Mario who is determined to finish the journey.Director Henri-Georges Clouzot made a classic film of men putting their lives at risk for money but it is also a character study as well. Mario is at first in awe of Jo as he arrives in the small town. Jo persuades Mario to get on this venture and he will show him the ropes. When the drive begins, Mario is initially frightened but gets the upper hand and starts to bully Jo around as age has finally caught up with him and Jo is scared.The film starts off in a leisurely manner as we see these disparate group of men, bored, causing trouble at the local bar.

I_Ailurophile,"May 27, 2023",10/10,"What can one possibly say except that this is a masterpiece? The first hour does a splendid job of establishing characters, their personalities, and the dynamics between them. With roughly ninety minutes left thereafter it may not seem like a lot, from the outside looking in, to tell the remainder of the story, but as it turns out those ninety minutes are nearly overwhelming. 'Le salaire de la peur,' or 'The wages of fear,' so ably builds tension and suspense with each passing moment that it's impossible not to be on edge. It's hard not to cringe with every slight divot in the road and bounce of the wheel, and when more substantial obstacles and problem-solving enters the equation, the picture becomes a masterwork of thrills that puts Alfred Hitchcock to shame. Factor in how the extreme danger and pervasive terror of the journey reveals more about the characters, and the result is simply a must-see classic, bar none.Every last centimeter of the length is filled with tremendous, riveting detail, in every way. There's no sense in which this isn't altogether perfect. The filming locations are gorgeous, and the production design is beyond all but the grandest of comparisons in making this the astoundingly vivid experience that it is. The vehicles, props, costume design, and hair and makeup are exquisite in rounding out the visuals. The stunts and effects are superb, as captivating as any one might hope to see in major action flicks. And it cannot be overstated: the cast are exemplary, from one to the next all giving impeccable performances of terrific range, physicality, nuance, and unexpected emotional depth. Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli, and even Peter van Eyck, given less prominence, are all to be commended for so crucially embodying the strong feelings that heavily define the feature.Henri-Georges Clouzot's direction is utterly marvelous, shrewdly orchestrating every shot and scene to capitalize on even the tiniest minutiae - focus on a mechanical part, or an expression - that will amplify and indeed maximize the ponderous apprehension that saturates each passing minute. Armand Thirard's cinematography, and the editing of Madeleine Gug, Etiennette Muse, and Henri Rust, are all specifically bent toward that same goal, heightening the fraught, harrowing energy until it surely couldn't go any higher. And while I can't speak to Georges Arnaud's novel, Clouzot and Jérome Geronimi's adapted screenplay is wonderfully smart and entrancing, giving us complicated characters, biting dialogue, and above all, spellbinding scene writing that keeps our attention raptly glued to the screen. The narrative is enriched with boundless, careful particulars to make the whole all that it could be, and the result is fantastic across the board.I well assumed I'd like this, and it was suggested to me by a trusted source, but still I'm blown away by just how brilliant 'Le salaire de la peur' is. Why, the 300-mile trek to the oil well is so immensely engrossing that one forgets how the exposition introduced a dire portrait of poverty and corporate abuse of workers, and other themes that would have been worth exploring all on their own. One struggles to further expound on the qualities of so great a movie without betraying plot points, but then, if my own experience is any indication, it doesn't matter any way. This is something that one needs to see for themselves to really appreciate the immediacy of every tiny facet, and for as good as it is, it's something that everyone needs to see at least once as far as I'm concerned. I don't know what more to say without repeating myself - 'Le salaire de la peur' is a magnificent, essential slice of cinema, an outstanding classic, and I can only give my highest, heartiest recommendation to one and all. Bravo!"
christopher-underwood,"Mar 22, 2021",9/10,"It is several years since I last saw this film and have since watched the William Friedkin 1977 remake, Socerer which is good but not as good and the much underrated Thieves' Highway (1949) directed by Jules Dassin, which is even better than the Clouzot film. Take nothing away from this though, it is a stupendous piece of filmmaking. The first hour is a wonderful evocation of a Central American town of much poverty and filled not only with the peasant locals but all and sundry from about the world drawn by the nearby oil wells and associated jobs but left stranded when most of those jobs dried up. There is action and movement in every frame and a tremendous tension is built up before the lorries begin to roll with their dangerous cargo. The individuals we have variously been introduced to are now sat beside each other in a race against time and desperate not to jostle their explosives. Tension, suspense and character exposition aplenty as this beautifully photographed and tightly directed film roars to an unexpected (?) conclusion."
dwpollar,"Mar 10, 2014",7/10,"1st watched 3/9/2014 -- 7 out of 10(Dir:Henri-Georges Clouzot): Tense French film about an American Oil company's hiring of four gentlemen from a poor village in what I think was Central America to complete a monumental task of hauling explosives 100 miles on dirt roads to help the SOC(Southern Oil Company). The movie starts with the arrival of one mafia-like gentlemen named Jo into the small village looking for an opportunity to make money. After seeing another Frenchman named Maury, looking like he was doing pretty well for himself, he sticks around. The other two future drivers are locals who have learned that you have to work for the American company to survive , but one named Luigi decides to take this new job after contracting concrete in his lungs from his current position. The director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, sets the stage by introducing the characters and the area for at least 30 minutes before introducing the main plot line. The explosives that they are carrying in the trucks are very brittle and this is shown to the interviewees so that they understand the danger involved. These folks though, have nothing to lose --- and so they pursue the possibility of $2000 per person without a whole lot of reservation. The hazards that await are mostly natural ones like a giant boulder blocking the road, and the sickness of one of the drivers but definitely hard to deal with. The movie is not really about the trek, but rather how the characters handle their quest. Character's true identities are revealed as they battle the road and themselves. Because this is a foreign production there is an air on un-certainty about what is going to happen and for me creates some extra suspense. The performances are worthwhile and the direction is almost flawless with my only real issues being the quick ending and quick demise of one of the trucks. This is kind of an anti-Speed movie that is almost as thrilling as the before-mentioned American movie. At 2 and 1/2 hours long it never gets boring...an excellent movie overall and a brilliant piece of filmmaking by the French director."
olphands,"Jan 22, 2022",3/10,"Not one likeable character in the whole film. I would have blown everybody up within the first fifteen minutes. I couldn't hang out with these people long enough to see if they made it, so my rating is for before they even got in the trucks."
ginger_sonny,"Aug 27, 2004",N/A,"Nail destroying tension, a fine cast and super sour direction make this 50s French thriller an unmissable classicAn extraordinarily gripping thriller from Henri-Georges Clouzot that establishes and maintains a level of tension rarely equalled elsewhere in cinema.He starts in a South American bar where poverty drives the men to fight for any jobs going. Four of the men agree to drive a consignment of nitroglycerine across a tortuous 300-mile jungle road to an American-owned oil refinery. They're not much of a team, each driven by greed, but they have to work together if they're to survive without being blown up by their cargo.Clouzot, though, isn't interested in Hollywood-type happy endings and, from the start, you're aware that there's no guarantee that any of the drivers will reach their destination."
briancham1994,"Jun 27, 2021",9/10,"This film is a masterpiece of direction. Starting out in a poverty-stricken South American town, the goings on shows the dereliction of society in a way that avoids sensationalism. The characters are all distinctly set up as they are employed by the oil company for a suicidal and dangerous mission, their desperation exploited. What follows is the most anxiety inducing film I have ever seen. Every detail of the truck drivers' journey, obstacles and dangers are depicted with excruciating vividness, along with their attitudes toward the incredible risk - from terror to determination to bravado. Their ultimate fate shows both the strength of the human spirit in the face of challenge but also the inescapable destiny of those who are treated as expendable."
eddie_baggins,"Jun 17, 2021",9/10,"Adapted from Georges Arnaud's famous novel (a novel that was also successfully adapted in the little seen but worth checking out 1977 William Friedkin feature Sorcerer), Henri-Georges Clouzot's esteemed and ageless thriller is a benchmark in cinematic tension building and one of the great films of the era in which it was released.Winning awards at the Cannes Film Festival and BAFTA awards upon release but only garnering true attention it deserved much later on as Western audience's partook in Clouzot's sweat inducing affair, The Wages of Fear has steadily etched itself into cinematic history as one of the most revered foreign films ever produced and easily one of the most taught and unrelenting experiences you could have as a filmgoer.Starting off relatively slowly but surely as we spend a significant chunk of time in a poor township deep in South America where joblessness and desperation goes hand in hand with the big American oil companies that have made themselves at home in the area, Fear lulls us into a false sense of security centred around day to day activities and dramas that gives way to one of the most white knuckle men on a mission movies we've ever seen as Yves Montand's charming Mario and a group of acquaintance's are tasked with transporting tonnes of nitroglycerine via truck across precarious back roads and uncontrolled wilds.Driven by the prospect of abundant riches should the job be completed successfully, Mario (and without a word of a lie, a fellow compatriot that is named Luigi) and his co-drivers face an uphill battle both figuratively and literally as the enormousness of their task at hand becomes ever more apparent and thanks to Clouzot's tout direction, Georges Auric's slick score and some wonderfully attuned editing, Fear is in a constant state of movement towards an explosive end game that is both unpredictable and memorable in equal measure.Unlike many films of the time in which it was released, it's hard pressed to find much wrong with such an ageless film outside of some slightly off early moments and some small instances of over the top acting, most elements of Clouzot's film would be unlikely to be delivered better in today's modern movie-making reality with Fear remaining a litmus test that other films cut from the same cloth must judge themselves against as this stunning thriller grips you like a vice and refuses to let go.Final Say -What may appear to simply be men driving some trucks is in fact one of tensest films produced. An ageless classic full of drama, heartbreak and the best use of characters known as Mario and Luigi in a feature film, The Wages of Fear is an old-timer you would do will to truck (track) down.4 1/2 pools of oil out of 5."
michadny,"Sep 9, 2015",9/10,"The Wages Of Fear was one of those films that I didn't instantly want to see. It's an old film, but that doesn't take away how awesome this film is. The Wages Of Fear is the most intense film I have ever experienced, and possibly one of the best adventure films that I have endured. The only complaint with this film I have is that the start is too long and tedious; with a quick edit this could have been rectified, but besides that, this film is a true piece of art.The Wages Of Fear doesn't hold back at all. It shocks you and with twists and turns throughout the whole film, it becomes somewhat unpredictable, which makes for a great bit of intense viewing."
calspers,"Dec 23, 2021",8/10,"""De salaire de la peur"" (1953) is an incredibly well-executed action thriller directed by Henry-Georges Clouzot.This film is simply put perfectly executed and directed by Clouzot who in his directional style efficiently introduces both the characters, the milieu, and the premise of the film in a noteworthy manner.The film is beautifully shot, interestingly written and well-edited, with intelligent pacing. Perhaps most significantly, the production design and shooting locations are phenomenal. A classical and pioneering effort in action and suspenseful filmmaking.Highly recommended!"
brogmiller,"Jan 26, 2024",10/10,"For his sixth feature director Henri-Georges Clouzot has taken Georges Arnaud's best selling thriller, has made a few changes in terms of character and incident, created a Latin American hellhole in the South of France, and given us what is arguably his masterpiece.The production was dogged with difficulty and filming was suspended for several months because of torrential rain, the exhausting Mistral and illness not to mention the age-old problem of Finance. When at last released it proved a phenomenal success, established its director as a 'master of suspense', made an international star of Yves Montand whose previous appearances had not exactly set the screen alight and rejuvinated the career of Charles Vanel who benefited from Jean Gabin's declining the role of Jo. Gabin had no objection to playing crooks, mobsters and shady lawyers but drew the line at portraying cowardice.Before the central action begins Clouzot has cleverly introduced an extended prologue which delineates the characters of Montand as Mario, Vanel as Jo, Folco Lulli as Luigi and the Bimba of Peter van Eyck. It is the dynamic between this quartet as well as the obstacles they face on their perilous journey that makes for such compelling viewing. Mention must be made of the wondrous Vera Clouzot as Linda whose role offers a perfect balance although the treatment of her character will no doubt infuriate the Feminists.There are two features here that are an essential element in this director's oeuvre, namely a pessimistic commentary on the human condition and his emphasis on 'contrast' which is underlined here by Armand Thirard's masterly use of light and shadow. In Clouzot's own words, 'I have sought an editing based on constant shocks'. I think it safe to say he has succeeded.The film's classic status has been further enhanced by William Friedkin's utterly pointless Hollywood makeover."
fosterstevenson8,"Nov 26, 2024",9/10,"I first saw this film as a teenager and only one other film hit me in the same manner at that was ALIEN.Oddly both shook me up for primarily the same reason, I had no idea what each was really about. How the Oscar nominations erred with none is still mind boggling! It hit all the nails on top of the head of what great story telling is in all the captions for me. It's a thriller, a psychological thriller, suspense and a horror film. The opening drama is there without giving away any of what's about to on the road. The spot on in its direction, cinematography, editing and the act is carrying its weight. I don't think this often but it's a masterpiece."
sashabokor,"Dec 3, 2014",7/10,"I found the first half of this, despite the pace very engaging in its slow, languid style, punctuated by some very captivating images. Vera Clouzot crawling around, cleaning the dirty floor with her half-crazed mannerisms is surprisingly sexy. The sense of boredom, heat, dirt, desolation and despair is palpable and convincing.The second half of the film is surprisingly formulaic and predictable. It starts off with some nerve-wracking Hitchcockian scenes they soon loose their suspense. I had a pretty good idea what was to become of the drivers and was pretty much unsurprised by turn of events.The conclusion is unbelievable and bordering on stupid with it's anti-Hollywood ending.I think this movie would have been a lot more interesting if it stayed in the god-forsaken town and didn't attempt to venture out into the world of suspense. Still, a striking debut for a director, just a bit overrated."
Boba_Fett1138,"Oct 1, 2010",7/10,"No, this is not an horrible movie and I did not disliked watching it but I absolute didn't seem to like it as much as most other people seem to do and in my opinion the movie is currently being way overrated.I'll give the movie that it was a bit of an unique one for its time. It actually has a pretty good premise, lots of action movies now days would be jealous off. However it doesn't really make this movie a fantastic or spectacular one to watch, though I'm taking it into account that this movie was from before the period that the action-genre got actually first fully developed. But by saying all this, you shouldn't think that this is an action packed movie with gun fights or anything but it's more a movie that takes an action type of approach with its style and story-telling, of its somewhat adventurous story, that gets brought very tense to the screen.I really had quite some problems with this movie. One is not even it's long running time of two and an half hours but more its set-up of its story and characters. Once you start thinking about it you should wonder of the first 30 minutes, or so, were truly needed for the movie or not. It's unnecessarily slow and it was mostly meant to introduce and set-up its character but they could had done this all a lot quicker really. And the characters aren't even that much good to begin with. Problem with them is that are some lying and cheating bums, who do everything for some money. I just could never fully like any of them, so therefore the movie already fell emotionally flat and became a distant one to watch.But yes, it's definitely true that the movie becomes a much better one to watch in its second half, when finally good and interesting things start to happen. They came up with some pretty good moments for the movie, that often work out real tense. They are being build-up well and executed surprisingly good and also original.But no matter how original the movie gets with some of its moments, the movie remains a very predictable one, or at least to me it was. I was not even surprised or taken away by its not-so-Hollywood-like ending. It got done a bit too obvious, in its build up toward it.Nevertheless this movie still remains a great and also unique achievement, from director Henri-Georges Clouzot. It's a French movie, in which a whole lot of different languages gets spoken by its characters. Besides French we have Italian, Spanish, English and some German, just to name a few languages that get spoken throughout this movie. It's simply a well directed and also good looking movie, aside from its settings that don't really seem to suit the movie its premise.The movie is supposedly set in an unnamed South-American country but the movie looks nothing like a South-American country at all. At first I even thought that the movie was being set in Marocco (also due to the many different languages being spoken in it) or some other northern African country. It's just one of those other little things that prevented me from truly getting in this movie and liking it as much as everybody else seems to do.It's a good movie, especially for its time but there was nothing in this movie that was surprising or truly grabbing me.7/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
alfredpr-69611,"Mar 8, 2025",1/10,"This movie manages to be excruciatingly boring despite the premise. I caught glimpses of it on Tubi; the part where the truck hangs over the crumbling rickety bridge. I immediately ordered it on Amazon to have in my collection. Joining Arduous Ordeal movies like Fitzcarraldo, Emperor of the North and Sorceror. The aforementioned films were utterly magnificent in scope and intensity.Wages of Fear promised great things in the highlights, desperate men pitted against oblivion, outwitting death by their ingenuity and animal desperation. I relished the thought of watching tense white knuckle moments unfold brilliantly.I caught the rest of the movie when I had a chance and was completely disappointed. The moments of tension were sparse and fleeting, what was in large quantity was a lot of nonsensical interplay and talking.The characters are totally unlikeable and they did some of the most unintuitive things while carrying a highly volatile substance like drive the truck at full galloping speed over rough terrain, almost rear ending the other truck laden with the explosives, backing up onto a rickety crumbling bridge as to almost fall over when clearly they didn't have to. Oh, there was a scene where one cretinous slobby man runs towards an explosion while everyone else takes cover in the other direction!It looked like scenes were merely spliced together as the movie was disjointed, no sense of continuity.All that was bad enough but the worst was the washed out appearance of this film, it looked like liquid bleach spilled onto every frame, what a mess from A-Z this turkey was. I canceled my order on Amazon, thankfully it didn't go thru yet.If you want action, suspense, dread and an entertaining thrill ride, watch Sorceror (1977)
Emperor of the North (1973) or Fitzcarraldo (1982)
Those directors, William Friedkin, Robert Aldrich and Werner Herzog were utter masters at crafting coherent films that could put you on edge. This French waste is despicable and trash! I went by the stills of the sweaty old man bellowing in agony as a promise of great things, turns out that old man in Wages of Fear constantly wore that face at the slightest discomfort, no psychology in this movie.If gratuitous talking and lamenting in a foreign language appeals to you, if you suffer from too much happiness in your life, if you have an unbridled love of watching white blur overexposed film, then you have found Zen with this atrocity."
xuergs2,"Jan 7, 2004",N/A,"One of the things I enjoyed about wages of fear was the way in which it simultaneously established and yet refused to be defined or determined by the personality of its characters.  We have the main character, whose typically youthful and laid-back demeanor, along with his vigor and his sexual energy, bely (or perhaps subtly express) the capability towards ruthlessness, a zeal that carries with it a more brutal taint when necessary and that reveals itself only later when the tensions become more and more pronounced.  We have Jo, the shady new arrival, whose initial calculating coldness, especially when juxtaposed with the florid main character's vibrancy and sense of camaraderie, metamorphosizes into an aged feebleness, as well as a more paralyzing anxiety that reflects his maturity compared to the young and headstrong leading role.  We have ___, perhaps, initially, one of the most mysterious characters, whose slightly sociopathic and violent tendencies, we learn later, arose from his three year internship in a nazi labor camp. To the question ""how old are you?"" he responds ""I'm 100 years old; sometimes it only takes a few months to age 100 years."" (continued in next paragraph)"

Marwan-Bob,"Sep 27, 2019",9/10,"Damn this was suspenseful. It goes above and beyond its premise in every possible way. I was skeptical that it wouldn't be as engaging or suspenseful as people say it is, but it really lived up to my expectations."
wierzbowskisteedman,"Jul 11, 2005",10/10,"The simple premise of four out of work men driving two truck nitro glycerine laden trucks across a forest to cut off the fire at a burning oil field is turned into a two and a half hour masterpiece, with some of the best character development ever filmed followed by some of the most tense action scenes in cinema history.The fact that this film does have a full hour of characterisation before it gets going is enough to see off most modern audiences. Unfortunately I didn't watch this film alone so the room wasn't free of shouts of 'NOTHING'S HAPPENED! THIS IS BORING!' Even though this is an action film, and one of the best of the 1950s at that (which pits it alongside the terrific works of Japan in this decade), it should not be treated as something to watch half drunk of a Friday night. After this first hour you will know just about everything regarding the personalities of the four men who are going to be the ones selected for the dangerous task, which makes the journey's change from friendly contest to a desperate competition where the men will do anything to be the first to reach the oil field and receive the reward all the more obvious and affecting.A huge corporation exploiting the working class in this way undoubtedly leads to many people reading into this film quite a lot. But even with this aside, once the film enters its second hour it showcases some of the best action scenes ever filmed. The recklessness the men develop over these scenes ultimately lead to their downfall, especially that of Mario.Overall this is too essential to miss. Many people will be bored stiff by the first hour, which is ironic because they are depriving themselves of the second half's awesome action that they were probably craving in the first place.Along with The Seven Samurai, this is the ultimate action film of the 1950s and one of the most tense films ever made."

Apryl,"Jun 7, 2001",10/10,"While I don't normally enjoy movies with subtitles, this one kept my attention when I didn't want to watch it.The movie is in English, Spanish, and French... and all these subtitles. The movie is in Black and White. There are no really attractive people in this movie (other than Yves Montand).But this is one INCREDIBLE story! This is a real white-knuckle story! Every time I wanted to think 'Ok, it's going to be alright now', instead, something else happens to scare me.The fear is not based on special effects, or on eerie music. There are no monsters.Just FEAR. And fear that is tied to money. The Love of Money is the root of all evil, and it will also get you to try to get past your fear.Wages of Fear is an incredible movie. See it from beginning to end. Don't get up for popcorn or sodas or the telephone. Don't take your eyes from the screen, either. When you think those guys are safe... they probably aren't."
AAdaSC,"Dec 7, 2025",7/10,"The film begins in an impoverished town in an unspecified country. We watch daily life unfold for a handful of characters until an opportunity arises for the townsfolk to escape the tedium of their lives. Four drivers are needed to transport highly dangerous nitro-glycerine to an oil refinery 300 miles away. Things can go ''Boom´´ at any point along this journey as the liquid is extremely sensitive to movement and to heat. They are in a very sunny climate! Amazingly, several volunteers put themselves forward for this role and we then follow the journey that two trucks take on this perilous journey. Can the chosen four survive?The cast do well but I must note a couple of things that no other reviewers seem to
have mentioned.Firstly, Vera Clouzot (Linda) is too old for her role. She is meant to be young and
innocent but is clearly older than her love interest Yves Montand (Mario).Secondly, it seems to me that Montand is a homosexual. He is not that interested in the
very feminine Clouzot, preferring to hit her rather than love her. He obviously has
issues with hating women. He also prefers to go out with his new buddy Charles Vanel (Jo) rather than keep his pre-arranged date with his supposed girlfriend, Clouzot. The interplay between Montand, his room-mate Folco Lulli (Luigi) and new kid on the block Vanel just screams romantic jealousy. Gay liaisons are rife in this camp.The ending is rather silly but the main focus of the film will have you gripped. There is one volunteer who does the most sensible thing in the film. He changes his mind before the selection process. No thanks. After a somewhat slow start, the film suddenly hits you with non-stop tension as the mission gets underway."
myschrec,"Jul 28, 2003",10/10,"""You're getting paid to be scared."" Just one of the great lines in this great movie. I am constantly amazed at how suspenseful the movie is ... even with repeat viewings.  So -- with my more recent viewings (of the excellent Criterion DVD) -- I began to consider some of the themes.What if the men were rich?  Would they have not even considered taking the risk?  If that is so, then why do very wealthy men and women (like Martha Stewart etc) still take risks engaging in insider trading, accounting scams, and tax evasion?  Could it be that some people take risks because ... in addition to the rewards ... they are thrilled by the risks?At one point, Luigi says to Bimba, something like, ""After tomorrow, we'll be rich ... if we are still alive. And if we are not, then it is all over anyway."" So is this a story about courageous men who risk their lives for money? Or it is a story about men who are prepared to die ... and perhaps prefer to die ... if they cannot get what they want? And is that the attitude that can get us through each day ... and get us what we want? ""Do or die?"" Or it that the moral position that justifies injuring others to get what we want?What if it were me? Would I have taken the job? At what point would I have given up? Perhaps I would not be afraid of dying. But would I be ruthless...and would I be unwilling to quit when the obstacles appear to be insurmountable?""You don't know what fear is.  ... It's catchy like smallpox.  And once you get it, it's for life.""Why is it that more men than women like this film?  The leads are men who face danger.  On the other hand, these ruthless and dnagerous men begin to crumble with fear ... not just the fear of dying, but the fear of failing. You'd think that women would appreciate a movie commenting on the foolishness and inconsequence of male fantasies."

gripviking,"Jan 14, 2004",N/A,"Even though I really like this film, I could not help feeling that some of the devices used to cause suspense were utterly ridiculous. Supposedly the trucks must either travel at least 40 MPH or less than 6 MPH on the cement road, yet they both go from over 40 MPH to a dead stop on the cement. Even worse was the scene where the trucks were forced to take a sharp u-turn. I was screaming at the stupidity of the characters when they insisted on backing an EXTRA 30 feet out onto the wooden platform after they had already turned around enough to continue forward. You don't need to be an experienced truck driver to see this. I could not believe all of the praise for these ""suspenseful"" scenes on the comments posts for this film."
rainfall,"Nov 16, 2006",10/10,"Everyone knows that french have invented noir, but they haven't limited it with urbanistic policiers and crime stories. Henri-Georges Clouzot's films are a living proof of this fact. ""Salaire de la Peur"" is one of his 3 famous masterpieces (other two are ""Quai des Orfèvres"" and ""Les Diaboliques"") all of which had an enormous influence on world cinematography. One of Empire's editors Ian Nathan had put ""Salair de la Peur"" among top 10 greatest actions/adventures of all time. His top 100 list might be controversial, but this is something where I totally agree with him. Clouzot's film became a milestone in many genres, among which are thrillers, actions, adventures and dramas. But even these 4 genres are not enough to describe the depressing and thrilling atmosphere of ""Salair de la Peur"". If your synonym for adventure is Indiana Jones, then you'll be surprised by the dark philosophy of this film (even though I love Indy myself). Indeed, the best word to describe this movie is noir. Noir at it's best. 10 out of 10."
Flinx-2,"Oct 4, 1999",10/10,"This movie will keep you on the edge of your seat.  It draws you in with compelling, three-dimensional characters, then places them in a situation that imperils both their lives and sanity. And it takes the audience along for the ride.  Clouzet's direction is masterful and all of the performances are right on. The setup is fairly simple: four men with nothing to lose but their lives agree to drive two trucks full of nitroglycerine through some of the most desolate and dying backroads that the unnamed third world setting has to offer.  Their obstacles each provide a tense scene that has you on the edge of your seat, giving seven or eight scenes more intense than any in your average thriller. From what I've read, this film was butchered upon initial US release due to its harsh portrayal of third world interests, so beware the chopped up version. A 10 out of 10 (Which I don't give out very often)"
fideist,"Jun 25, 1999",9/10,"I have seen literally thousands of movies, and this one is unique.  It is its own, and holds its own.The suspense is sometimes on a par with Hitchcock's best. [Twice, even my fourteen year old son had to sit up, and forward onto the edge of his seat!]The International flavor is unparalleled.  We hear four different languages spoken.  We see a mixture of cultures that other filmmakers can only dream about -- White European, White American, Native American, Hispanic, African, and on and on.The acting is flawless all along the cast.  Particularly interesting is the interaction between characters within and across genders.While the story starts out slow, overall it is entertaining.  And while melodrama is approached, it never is breached; reality is never really abandoned so a very difficult and fine line is successfully walked.Highly recommended."
john-727,"Sep 20, 2002",10/10,i used to think there was a hidden book /movie/ song that I had never read/ seen/ heard that was fantastic and I would never be the same again  - -well that's not true BUT if there was one it would be this movie-- yeah the remake is OK (sorcerer)  but the original is the best non English film since the Jazz Singer - and perhaps the best suspense picture till Hitchcock hit form. Excellent.
9khjxz,"May 19, 2006",10/10,"A film with something to say: «You and I aren't paid to work, we're paid to be afraid», sic. It may not look like much but's that's probably more than a couple of years of Hollywood ( especially, since they ran out of «inspiration» and can only «re-make» versions of cartoon super-heroes). A story of men with a job to do, a confrontation of two opposite ways to look at WORK and at life, a film with characters that don't show-up in theatres anymore. It's a stark movie. The extreme risks involved, the urgency of the situation, the the extreme monotony of the Latin-American summer, the extreme characters all produce a over-contrasted image of todays' (even today, yes, and ever more) world."
moritzherz,"Jan 29, 2023",7/10,"This movie is a relict of the past. Movies like this are not produced anymore. And that is sad.The story is full of tension, you never know what will happen next. The plot twists hit heavy and the ending is all but happy. This movie has several moral life lessons about friendship, greed and hybris. Although it's 2 hours and 20 minutes long it does not feel like that. The pacing is strong, maybe the beginning is a little bit slow.You should watch this movie if you want to experience how movies were made in the 1950s or if you just want a movie without a happy ending. Neithertheless you get a piece of art definitely worth your time."
dearmond-2,"Jun 10, 2017",10/10,"I have no skill at writing reviews. I just returned from watching this film at the Port Moody Film Society. Other reviews are very good and I don't need to repeat them. I do like the way the director sets up the scenes in the decrepit town building up the characters. When the journey started with the two trucks delivering nitroglycerine to an oil site, I was virtually tied to my seat. I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I missed some of the dialogue because of the intensity of the film. I highly recommend this film, but I do not recommend it for the weak of heart. My heart is still beating higher than normal and the film ended over an hour ago. I gave this film a 10 without any reservation."
paulclaassen,"Feb 12, 2024",5/10,"A While ago I watched 'Sorcerer', the 1977 remake of 'The Wages of Fear'. The first 40 minutes of that movie were confusing and boring and could easily have been skipped. 'The Wages of Fear', I fear, was no different. By skipping the first 40 minutes you won't miss a thing, because all the confusing mumbo jumbo during these 40 minutes contributes NOTHING to the events that follow. It's best to start watching around the 40-minute mark with the crisis on the oil fields. Believe me, you honestly won't miss anything.The only way to extinguish the flames at the oil field, is with a ton of nitroglycerine, which has to be transported in jerrycans on two trucks. Four experienced truck drivers are selected for the job. The trucks have no safety gadgets or shock absorbers and the roads they must travel on are treacherous. Desperate for money, the drivers accept the job regardless of the high risks involved.Over the next 90 minutes (that's if you were to start at the 40-minute mark) we watch the drivers carefully transporting their dangerous cargo. It is a long and slow journey with many obstacles along the way. Unfortunately, I found the film just as slow paced as the speed at which the trucks were moving.No doubt, some scenes must have been highly suspenseful and even frightening back in 1953, but not by today's standards. Don't get me wrong, there's no denying this is an incredibly well made picture - for its time. Adding to the danger is the fact CGI did not exist back then and everything had to be done practically. This fact alone deserves the high praise the film received.Whether a film is well made or not, I always rate it on the entertainment value (for me). Often well made films are not all that entertaining while cheap B-movies are. So, my final verdict on 'The Wages of Fear' is that is a well made film, and there were a few highly entertaining moments. As a whole, though, I found the film too slow. It would have been far more suspenseful with a shorter runtime, and significant editing, especially those boring first 40 minutes."
StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 21, 2005",N/A,"In my opinion, Le Salaire de la peur is without a doubt one of the greatest suspense films ever made. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot was known as the ""French Hitchcock"" but his output of films was small due to illness. He did however manage to make two terrific films, ""Le Salaire de la peur"" (The Wages of Fear) and ""Les Diaboliques"". (Hitchcock supposedly made Psycho in response to Les Diabolique.)Le Salaire de la peur is about a group of desperate men stuck in South America who are hired to drive two trucks with nitroglycerin across treacherous mountain terrain to a burning oil field so the explosives can be used to put out an oil well fire. Along the way they are confronted with one obstacle after another. There is an absolutely hair-raising scene on a wooden overhang on a cliff, and the scene in which they try to remove a boulder in the road nail-biting. There are no special effects here which results in scenes that have an incredible amount of tension.Yves Montand is the leader of the men and he's just great. Charles Vanel is also in the film. He was Alfred Fichet, the private detective in Les Diaboliques. Also in the film is director Clouzot's absolutely beautiful wife, Vera Clouzot (she was also in Les Diabolique.) The film is subtitled. I highly recommend this film as well as Les Diaboliques. See it on DVD."
lupu-2,"Sep 18, 2000",9/10,"This outstanding film about a highly dangerous transport job establishes character in depth before the real suspense begins.  Anti-American sentiment runs strong in the depiction of oil-company managers in a Venezuelan shanty town. They are thick-skinned vulgarians who, in the process of ""just doing their job,"" have desensitized themselves completely to the poverty and hunger around them. One foreman hires an old friend, who is French, along with another Frenchman, an Italian and a Dutch man to transport nitroglycerin in two trucks to a distant site.  The slightest jolt will blow the trucks and their drivers to smithereens.  The men selected for the job are desperate for work, being foreigners stranded in an economically depressed country and desperate to get out of the abyss of poverty they have fallen into.Once the journey begins, the tension is unrelenting.  The director masterfully plays on the viewer's nerves.  I was often shrieking out loud, so complete was the illusion of suspense and fright.  Unlike so many American action films, the destruction depicted is not contrived but is an inevitable consequence of the difficult work conditions and the generally depressing environment.  Most viewers, I think, will expect some of the 4 men to die along the way, but the ending is full of psychological irony. This film also amounts to an insightful study of virility and courage in the face of death."
Neal,"May 5, 2000",9/10,"Don't be put off by the long, leisurely first act.  Once the trucks roll out your heart will be in your mouth, and even the most jaded action-adventure fanatic is likely to go rigid with anxiety and stay that way right through the horrifying coda.  Among the uniformly excellent principals, Vanel is superb and Montand sublime -- a fully human action hero who, without bulging biceps or snide catchphrases, could eat Schwarzenegger's lunch and make him say ""thank you"" for the pleasure.  Clouzot's other great thriller, LES DIABOLIQUES, is an MGM musical compared to this.  Not to be viewed by anyone about to take a driver's test or renting a U-Haul for the first time."
adrian-43767,"May 3, 2018",10/10,"Here is a masterpiece that only recently received much deserved restoral treatment. Criterion have done a great job of cleaning it, bringing out the stark but splendid photography. Clouzot's direction is immaculate, the acting - especially by Vanel and Montand - is superlative, the action sequences are taut, credible and masterpieces of tension, and dialogue is crisp, logical and even darkly humorous at times.There is some controversy about the ending, which some feel is unnecessarily bleak. Perhaps so, but everything in this film about lost souls who will do anything, even put their lives in extreme danger, to make a buck in a God-forsaken part of Venezuela, points to that end. The film's great merit is that it is never predictable, only logical.There has never been a better film in this specific type of adventure laced with social comment. The behavior of the US oil company in relation to workers, local population, and incidentally hired personnel remains true. This masterpiece is well ahead of 1953."
pdmanske,"Sep 25, 2013",10/10,"This film was a wonderful experience for me. A real work in every sense with low budget everything. A B&W camera, respondent actors and a tight script. A great fiber treatment for film lovers. The fat was cut at every turn. The actors are slobs that you've never seen before and have never seen again yet they capture you. Exotic people in an exotic place yet you can relate. 1953 is a year before all of the actors transmuted into 22 year old yuppies with great hair. Suspense hooks dropped with and without you knowing and then recalled with great deftness. If you insist of foisting foreign art films on your friends, be confident that that this film will win them over."
cobram-1,"Aug 12, 2003",10/10,"While seemingly slow in the first half, we begin the second half of the film with the firm idea that we know the characters in depth.The second half is where director Henri-Georges Clouzot builds the suspense to almost unbearable levels as a series of life-threatening problems confront the foursome we thought we knew before their journey, we're forced to consciously or subconsciously examine our prejudices when the ""lowlifes"" reveal their true characters in the worst of times.This movie makes us ask ourselves the question: Will we be as noble and brave as these dregs of society when it's our turn at the wheel?"
nimdahi,"Dec 22, 2004",9/10,"""The Killing"" Stanley Kubrick's 2nd/3rd feature. Both are totally relentless, as is ""Bad Lieutenant"" by Abel Ferrara.This 10 lines thing is a pain. But whatever, much of life is about pain, we know that if we are on here because we love a movie like ""The Wages of Fear."" Have I reached 10 lines yet? No? Well...Consider this the light that will lead us home. I saw this movie again recently after first seeing it once about 10 years ago, in an art-house theater, the Castro I think, in San Francisco. What stuck through the years was of course the suspense, also because it's what the movie is famous for. What my recent viewing of it revealed was the richness of the characters and relationships in the story. The relationship between Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) is the most deeply explored and turns into a clever and ironic mirror of Mario's relationship with Linda (Vera Clouzot), whom he mostly treats like garbage in the beginning of the movie, especially after his new friend Jo has arrived and the two of them become inseparable. Only later, when the two men start to go through hell together, does their relationship take a turn for the worse, and Mario assumes the same dominating, emotionally and physically abusive role he has in his relationship with Linda."
jzappa,"Jan 7, 2007",9/10,"The audience is inalterable once beginning this long, drawn out story of agonizing suspense. The script takes its time with detailed exposition that fixates us with its genuine drive and predilection for its characters, misogynist, oppressive, brawny men with indistinctly sympathetic sides. Once the turning point of the story takes place, the suspense of every moment during the scenes where they are driving the trucks loaded with nitro is like your life flashing before your eyes. You cringe and wince for these guys and almost involuntarily vocalize your anguish.The reason the film is so effective is because of Henri-Georges Clouzot's grand ability to be fixed, to anchor certain scenes with long closeups, continuous sounds of growling truck engines, and an intensely realized pace. The Wages of Fear is first-class suspense, sharing a window seat next to Hitchcock."
SAMTHEBESTEST,"Jul 29, 2020",7/10,"The Wages Of Fear (1953) :
Brief Review -An Italian-French thrilling drama of human battle on Ethereal thread between Hunger and Death. Hunger is that one thing for which human can go onto risk his life without caring about sophisticated ways of fulfilling it. It can make you do anything, it increases the greed and then all left in human is nothing but a soulless money digger. The Wages Of Fear adduces stories of some men in French town who got no job to do but had to make a living. The company offers a high risk job on good wages to truck drivers and a few of them desirably accepts the tough task. All this journey of them driving to thier destination is thrilling and very natural but unfortunately it begins after a very slow and dull start. But once it begins, there is no slowing down to the following show and overall usability is served well if you can forgive the boring start. The entire narrative is very intensely formed and the formation of scenes is linearly correct. Besides, it wastes so much time to build the characters and pick up the main portion of the script. However, when it ends you don't feel disappointed despite some flaws. It could have been a much more greater film in early time but post 1950 cinema was moved way ahead. A major problem could be that this Italian-French drama didn't want to lose the essence and human factors and keep it close reality, in which it is definitely succeeded whereas theatrically it was slightly below the belt. Intense presence of Yves Montana and Charles Vanel is engaging amd noticeable. Henri-Georges Clouzot's direction is detailed, subtle and his solemn approch on the script is praiseworthy. Overall, this film manages to prove it's point of being socially important film and thats all matters the most. A very good attempt and certainly watchable film.RATING - 7/10*By - #samthebestest"
CinemaClown,"May 22, 2015",N/A,"From the director of Les Diaboliques, The Wages of Fear is one of Henri-Georges Clouzot's best-known works that remains as effective today as it was back during its time of release. Certainly amongst the finest examples of suspense in cinema history, the thrilling manner in which it manages to sustain its nail-biting tension for the majority of its runtime makes it an instant classic.Set in an isolated South American village, The Wages of Fear tells the story of 4 men who in order to escape from their miserable lives accept a handsome-paying but highly-dangerous job of driving two trucks over mountain dirt roads. The trucks are loaded with the extremely volatile nitroglycerine which might go off at the slightest bump, thus required extra attention on the part of the drivers.Co-written & directed by Henri-Georges Clouzot, the first hour of The Wages of Fear isn't an easy sit for the picture takes its time to introduce & acquaint its characters but once those trucks start moving, every single moment that follows is an edge-of-the-seat stuff for there is a foreboding sense of tension that looms over the film throughout its remaining runtime.Shot in crisp black n white, Cinematography makes excellent use of camera plus its clever execution single-handedly elevated those suspenseful moments to a nerve-wracking level. Editing could've done away with more sequences in the first hour but it's perfect in the later half. Sound design also deserves a mention for it plays a key role in keeping the suspense alive.Coming to the performances, the cast comprises of Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck, Folco Lulli & Véra Clouzot, and their input is as commendable as it is valuable to the story although Mrs. Clouzot does go a bit overboard at times. But what impressed me the most about these characters is that each one of them has their own identity, their own history & their own fear plus their chemistry with each other is pretty much spot-on.On an overall scale, The Wages of Fear is certainly amongst the greatest films of the 1950s & is a cinematic treasure whose quality will never be diminished by the test of time. While the first half isn't without its shortcomings, the second half of The Wages of Fear is smartly directed, deftly written, brilliantly photographed, tightly edited & fabulously performed. An ingenious piece of quality storytelling, The Wages of Fear comes thoroughly recommended."
kjm,"Oct 31, 2000",10/10,"This is pure existential suspense, a film noir classic from the country where the term was coined. Its many remakes have never come close to capturing the nailbiting suspense and potent philosophical overtones that this original version possesses. It is a classic of the genre, in many ways the purest example, the epitome, of postwar European noir"
jminer,"Jul 26, 2000",10/10,"How can a b/w film in French, by a director never mentioned in the same breath as Truffaut or Godard, Clement or Clair, beguile audiences for nearly half a century?  Not through a big budget or special effects but through classical film-making.The setting is nowhere.  The characters are from a community of human dregs. Their journey is a chance at redemption.How do you make a highly allegorical film and keep it taut, suspenseful and naturalistic?  Great acting is part of it; John Ford once said the most interesting thing in the world is a human face, and Clouzot uses close-ups, particularly of Yves Montand, to great effect. He also keeps a tight rein on the pace, paying cinematographic attention to tiny details.  This heightens the suspense while recalling Hemingway's early short stories, in which a man survives the nihilistic world around him by focusing on the details of work. Clouzot suggests tensions among the characters, then expands on them, and we watch them change under pressure - the pressure of the perilous task they face, and the pressure they exert on each other - not unlike his film Les Diaboliques. The power of this unique film lies in its frank study of humanity battling a hostile universe - but its appeal lies in its ability to keep the whole story balanced and rolling along in an exciting, naturalistic style. A film of tight editing that highlights its expansive vision: there aren't many like it."

It has had a lasting impact. Other correspondents have analysed the movie in comments on this page and I don't intend to try to out-analyse the perceptive comments  that have already been made. Sufficient be it to say that for me this is the film that will always stand out amongst the thousands of others I have seen. I had consigned it to memory, albeit lasting, until it was featured on a late night TV showing in, I think, the late eighties.  I defer to all the erudite comments others have made about it, and concur with their  generally laudatory tone."
CinemaSerf,"Feb 9, 2024",7/10,"Four men are stranded in, quite literally, a dead end town with no money to get out. All they do each day is kill time, drink and get gradually more disillusioned. Then their luck changes. Or does it? A major fire breaks out at a nearby oil drilling facility and the manager needs a brave/foolhardy gang to drive two truckloads of ultra-sensitive nitro-glycerin along some poorly maintained roads and across some treacherous terrain to the site so they can extinguish the fires. It's a pretty international convoy that sets off with their two travelling time bombs safe in the knowledge that the slightest vibration could blow them all to kingdom come. Of course, the sweltering heat and their fraying nerves all contribute to what now ensues - an almost perfectly paced drama that gradually raises the tension so that we almost share their perilous journey with them. ""Mario"" (Yves Montant) is a non-nonsense Corsican who pairs with,""Jo"" (Charles Vanel) who is a bit of French thuggery. Luigi (Folco Lulli) just wants to get on with the job and he drives with the slightly enigmatic German ""Bimba"" (Peter van Eyck). There's not really another world for this film, despite it being filmed outdoors, in dense jungle. It's claustrophobic. Their world is reduced to two tiny cabs with danger around every corner, insects that would cheerily suck their blood and all for $2,000 each! The journey affects their characters too - the brash and confident ""Jo"" gradually succumbing to his fears whilst his partner steps up - and an inter-dependency of sorts develops that does rather surprise. Henri-George Clouzot creates a film here that really does have you caring for these men in the end - even if, at the start, you have little interest in or sympathy for them. He manages to convey to an audience the absolute sense of anguish and the sheer determination of these men as tragedy ensues and their priorities and perspectives take a jolt that would readily set off their cargo. I thought Vanel probably has the best character to portray here, but the increasingly effective dynamic with Montand works really well to create a must-see tale of survival."
lee_eisenberg,"Nov 16, 2023",10/10,"One of cinema's all-time classics depicts a US business executive hiring an assortment of down-on-their-luck men in an unidentified Latin American country to transport nitroglycerin on a poorly maintained road. ""Le salaire de la peur"" (""The Wages of Fear"" in English) is undeniably one of the most pulse-pounding movies ever made, but was probably one of the first movies to directly address the US's dirty dealings in Latin America, to the point that entire scenes got cut for the US release. While watching the uncensored version, I could only think ""This has probably happened multiple times in real life."" There's a reason why one of the characters mentions a division of labor.Listed as one of IMDb's top 250, a major winner at the Cannes Film Festival, and on Steven Schneider's list of movies to see, this is an unpleasant movie, but an important one.

chaos-rampant,"Jul 2, 2008",N/A,"There are very few thrillers that can turn a very simple premise in a diatribe in suspense and terror and in that aspect I think it is important that a film like Wages of Fear is celebrated for both its effectiveness and its simplicity. Whereas others will seek the causality of their thriller in convoluted plots, police procedurals, supernatural killers and what not, Wages of Fear is content to be inspired and firmly grounded in reality. Four unemployed foreigners, trapped without visas somewhere in Latin America, are hired by an American oil company to drive two trucks filled with tons of nitroglycerin that is needed to kill the fire in a burning derrick. The wage is $2,000 each; a getaway ticket and a promise of luxury. But at what cost? The wages of fear indeed.At the hands of a lesser director, the premise could have been handled in a workmanlike way, with a movie-of-the-week attitude. Clouzot instead spends the first 50 minutes setting up a very believable world for the rest of the movie to unfold into. Not only is every player given his due shades of characterization, but their motives (escape from Latin America and money) become fully understood. The small town they live in is depicted as a living hell of sorts. Full of mosquitos, the scorching weather, impoverished natives, malaria, little food and money. The set-up is so expertly handled that the decision the characters have to make (take the job or not) becomes painfully obvious.And then comes the bulk of the movie. A grueling lesson in suspense that would make even Hitchcock himself green with envy. As if driving a ticking bomb through bumpy roads isn't enough, everything else that can go wrong does. Clouzot adds another layer of hard-hitting realism by making both the obstacles the characters have to overcome and their efforts to do so utterly believable and as hard as they appear to be. The total absence of music only enforces this sort of pain-staking realism. Even if it appears to be a little far-fetched at times; it's still a movie after all. But it's so far removed from the studio melodramas of the 50's that it shines by comparison. Just think of the relationship Mario, one of the drivers, has with a poor girl. What appears to be the requisite love story is turned on its head and becomes one of abuse and need. There's no ""I love you/ I love you too"" schmaltz to be found here. Some people may be too eager to accuse Clouzot of misogyny but I wonder where the line stops; is it the screenwriter, the director or simply what this character is all about. The way Mario treats the girl might leave an unpleasant aftertaste in one's mouth, but sometimes that's how life is. All the Hollywood sugar-coating in the world can't change that.A perfect companion piece to this kind of solid 50's film-making would be John Huston's Treasure of the Sierra Madre, if the analogy has any merit. As a testament to the movie's absorbing power, I was glued to the screen for every one of 146 nail-biting minutes. Truly a classic thriller that stands up to close scrutiny and remains one of the best, 55 years later"
gavin6942,"Nov 26, 2014",8/10,"In a decrepit South American village, men are hired to transport an urgent nitroglycerine shipment without the equipment that would make it safe.Bosley Crowther wrote, ""The excitement derives entirely from the awareness of nitroglycerine and the gingerly, breathless handling of it. You sit there waiting for the theatre to explode."" (One might think he was explaining the plot of ""Speed"", but this is far better.) Due to the negative portrayal of the American oil company SOC, the film was accused of anti-Americanism and several scenes were cut for the U.S. release. In 1999, the Criterion Collection released a DVD which included 21 minutes of film which had been removed for the U.S. version. This latter, at 147 minutes, is the one everyone should see.The film brought Clouzot international fame, and allowed him to direct the better-known, if not quite as critically-acclaimed, ""Les Diaboliques""."
ElNeilo,"May 26, 2016",10/10,"There's not much else to add to what others have written about this superb thriller, which reminded me of another cracker, Ice Cold In Alex. If getting half crushed by a jeep and then almost drowning in quicksand is bad, imagine getting your bones broken by a lorry and then engulfed in crude oil. Vera Clouzot is stunning and all the guys are perfectly seedy, desperate and selfishHowever, don't believe anyone who tells you that Friedkin's 70s remake Sorcerer is its equal or even superior, it doesn't come halfway close. For anyone to survive this hell is a travesty and the explanations of how the protagonists came to this pretty pass are downright contrived."
francisdufort-75626,"May 31, 2022",8/10,"Although it starts out quite slowly without much going on for the first twenty minutes, Le salaire de la peur (wages of fear) is nonetheless a great movie. Basically, four guys in two trucks need to deliver a shipment of nitroglycerin by crossing deserts, forests and mountains.It's a simple, but great story. There's good suspense that comes from the various obstacles that the four guys encounter on their journey and there's interesting ways of going around or beating those obstacles . It's fascinating to see the many solutions and ideas that they come up with. This perilous journey, mixed with a good mix of characters and a real sense of danger make for a great movie that I really enjoyed watching. I know it's just guys driving trucks in the wild, but it was a brilliant movie and I'm glad I saw it."
winner55,"Aug 3, 2006",9/10,"one recent reviewer noted that by the second half of the film - when the real adventure begins - we have lost a certain amount of interest in the characters, to the extent that we care for them less than would seem to be appropriate for such dramatic adventure film. i agree with this, and also feel it to be the film's primary error; yet, surprisingly, this is not a reason to avoid the film or even dislike it.there are two reasons for this. first, this detachment from the characters is clearly intended by the director. he set out to tell his story with no compromise to audience expectations - as they were understood at the time - and has succeeded well, over all. this detachment doesn't quite work as intended, because in a longer film, the audience wants to get to know - and to like - some one or other of the characters. clouzot gives us something like a a version of treasure of sierra madre where all the characters are variants of bogart's dobbs; we need at least a walter huston here. still, i think the audience can respect clouzot's decision, even if mistaken, because it is at least made with the integrity of the artist.secondly, the cinematography and editing of the second half of this film - which never call attention to themselves, but seem utterly natural, as though anyone making this film would need to make it in precisely the same way - quietly insist on our watching what happens whether we want to or not - and frequently, we don't - terrible things happen in this film's second half, but we can't take our eyes away from it, we seem to be as condemned as the truck-drivers to live out this brutal mission; so when the film ends, all the 'existential' questions that - intentionally - are left dangling, are dropped right on our shoulders as our burden to bear.a film that insists you watch it, without ever calling attention to itself - now that's great film-making."

The Wages of Fear made such a deep impression on me when I was a youngster (probably aged about 7 or 8) that its title stuck with me even up until a year or so ago when I was lucky enough to catch this great work of cinema on t.v. If I hadn't recognized the title, I would probably have missed it. Even on the small screen I found it an enthralling experience from start to finish. There are sequences along the way that are miracles of staging and editing. I urge all lovers of cinema to see it if they can, preferably, of course, on the big screen."
adrianovasconcelos,"Jan 7, 2022",10/10,"In 1950, Director Henri-Georges Clouzot, who had acquired some international standing with his 1943 masterpiece, LE CORBEAU, visited Brazil and cranked out a couple of documentaries on that country. He also took the opportunity to marry the exceedingly beautiful Vera Clouzot, who would appear in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR and, more famously, in LES DIABOLIQUES.Clouzot experienced life in South America in loco. He learned of the difficulties of survival in that environment, the decimation of nature and exploitation of human beings by rampant and merciless capitalism. All those aspects bob up in LE SALAIRE DE LA PEUR, but human nature provides the central propeller. We see human nature battling for money, killing and putting one's life at risk for what amounts to a pittance. Envy, greed emerge as the main motivators as Mario (Montand), M Jo (Vanel), Folco Lulli (Luigi) and Bimba (Van Eyck) battle inch by inch the vagaries of potholed roads that can instantly set off the nitro, atmospheric conditions, rotting wooden bridges, and all manner of natural obstacles as the shipment of nitroglycerin nerve-rackingly slowly moves across the 300 miles to an oil fire.Plus, of course, the deceit immanent in the human soul, which constantly seeks an opportunity to spring a trap on a fellow traveler, not to mention that if only one survives, he gets the whole $2,000 booty. In a Venezuela - a minicosmos for South America - brimming with atrocious poverty and backwardness, that amount seems a fortune to those men, and to any of the other jilted competitors, who would sell their souls to be able to go on that almost suicidal drive.Yet, ironically, some kind of personal interest-driven loyalty also develops and connects these individuals, pushing them deeper and deeper into God-forsaken territory. I do not recall a single mention of religion. Yet the cocktail of French, English, Castillian and Italian languages offers a veritable Tower of Babel in a largely uncivilized, uncultured, and even illiterate setting. There is no spiritual authority, higher moral value here. The love that Linda (Vera Clouzot) feels for Mario, an almost telepathic connection, as the ending will show, is probably the closest connection between two persons in the film.All told, excellent nitty gritty, taut script, tapping the complexity of human emotions and states of mind under such trying conditions. Exceptional direction by Clouzot, superlative performances from Montand, Vanel, Van Eyck, wonderful cinematography and film editing. Intelligent film with many meanings simmering beneath the surface of an action flick.Absolute masterpiece of this very specific type of road journey. 10/10."

Imperialism through the eyes of natives, doing what they must to scrape by while trying to keep their culture intact. Beautifully painted characters: you meet them, then all degrading initial impressions are slowly stripped away. The first half is excellent culture-shock drama, but once we hit the road, it reveals itself as one of the smartest, most suspenseful, & visually penetrating adventure thrillers ever."
RM851222,"Oct 29, 2016",10/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""The Wages of Fear"" (1953) is highly involving thriller / drama with very simple story and premise, but because of great movie making from director Henri-Georges Clouzot who also wrote the script, this is a must see.Acting was very good by all involved, especially by the 2 leads and 2 supporting characters although Véra Clouzot overplayed her role a bit in my opinion. But again it is the director who did amazing job in creating tense and very involving movie from not maybe very start but when the ""delivery job"" begins, it is one very tense ride till the very end which i think was cynical, as it is the world we live in.Overall, ""The Wages of Fear"" is a great film must see for everyone who loves realistic as possible and tense movies. Everything works here greatly making this a true classic."

mike-chung38,"Jan 2, 2026",5/10,"I've come to realize that there must be a different rating lens for older films because this one really didn't age well. The numerous 10 ratings had me looking forward to a really gripping masterpiece, but instead I watched a very plodding, poorly acted mess. Seriously, the dialogue and acting were laughable by today's standards. M. Jo's character change made no sense and I'm sure that Vera Clouzot got her part simply because her hubby was the director. In particular, the choppy editing, simply terrible acting (many here rave about the acting for some unknown reason) and misogyny made it a very disappointing view for me. I can also understand why some versions cut so much from the intro because it was pretty tedious."
parkerbcn,"Sep 19, 2021",9/10,"One of the cinema classics that I haven't seen before and that, for the most part, still packs quite a punch. I have to say that the existentialism of the first part of the movie, that portrays the lives of different characters exploited by an American oil company in a fictitious Central American town is the one that spoke loudest to me (it's easy to see why it was heavily censored in the US upon its release), but the tension of the main plot line in the second half is also very impressive and it's easy to see its influence on the cinema that came after it. Extra points are given for the guest appearances of Mario and Luigi."
manuel-pestalozzi,"Sep 27, 2006",9/10,"This is a great action-triller classic, the suspense really never slackens. It also has a strange, dark humoristic element which is fed mainly by the fact that all the main protagonists are far away from home and don't exactly know what they're doing.The location somewhere in a tropical or subtropical land is a dead end place. Europeans from different nations, all males, strand there and would like to go away as quickly as they can. They are a curious bunch of crooks of different ages and social stratas, no sense of friendship exists between them. And then, there are the Americans (called amerlocques, in true slang fashion). They work the local oil fields and are presented (in the European's comments, that is) as a greedy breed apart who will move on as soon as the resources are exhausted. They even have their own cemetery, comments the main character, all prefabricated! There are many of these quirky lines throughout the movie. The cross language style works very well in this movie, hearing the original sound certainly adds to the pleasure.The Europeans are hired by the Americans to transport highly explosive nitroglycerin to an uncontrollably burning oil well. They cannot resist doing this high risk job which might guarantee their return to Europe. One team consists of a German and an Italian. The second of two Frenchmen, and they, of course, are the main characters. Yves Montand and Charles Vanel make a great team. Especially Vanel is really brilliant. At first sight they are just the typical old gangster and young, admiring hood couple. But they both have a strange kind of goofiness which makes me suspect strongly that the director had Laurel and Hardy in mind  the physical frame of the two fits to a T, anyway.The two greatest scenes: Montand and Vanel sitting in a little park (sort of) in the dead end town. In the background a sculpturally shaped black woman takes an open air shower (full nudity in 1953, no less!). The woman stoops and starts screaming. A large, hairy spider moves tentatively over a white towel. Montand gets up, steps over and crushes it with his white canvas slipper beaming like Stan Laurel, kind of ain't I the most daring guy around?"" Then there is the problem of crossing a large puddle of crude oil with the truck. Vanel walks in front, checking for obstacles. His legs get entangled in a large branch already under tension from the truck's wheels. Montand does not dare stop the truck, Vanel submerges in the puddle, gets run over and comes up totally black. It is horrific but in a perverse way also comical. The truck gets stuck in the puddle, Montand drags Vanel out, then he has to take a dive himself to fix a cable. He comes up black and black Vanel, lying deadly wounded against a tree, toasts to him with a thermos flask. It's as dark as humor can possibly get."
Kdosda_Hegen,"Feb 19, 2021",9/10,"This film is insane. Possibly the most jaw dropping and intense film I've ever seen. There's tons of adventures, great humor and distinguishable characters.

tgif-1,"May 14, 2001",10/10,"i am not a great fan of old movies especially black and white and moreover french ones. But this one deserves a bit attention. The movie maker, with this strange story of two guys convoying nitroglycerine from one point to another, succeded in making a adrenaline-full movie. Stress and suspense is everywhere, and you often hold your breath. This old movie is far better than most of the action-movies playing in theaters. So if you want to see a good movie with action, adrenaline and well playing actors, go on and watch out for the end!"
grikdog,"Jul 16, 2005",8/10,"The acting belongs to the French Noir strut and fret school, instead the modern acting as posing and shouting school, with a great deal of sentimental schlock about good labor-management relations, the nobility of labor, and revolution -- e.g., the woman who complains before the crowd about the oil well explosion and the resulting loss of limb and life is the same strikingly noble heroine shot in 3/4 profile from low camera angles that graces post office walls from the 1930's (and college dorm walls in the early 1970's) in the U.S. A classic instance from Ronald Reagan's ""Hollywood Communist"" agenda, albeit French. Mario is a Eurotrash clown, but muy macho, while Linda (Vera Clouzot), the ""half-savage"" adoring victim of Mario's apache, is impossible to portray in post-feminist film. Imagine a brunette Paris Hilton sans skank. If you've seen Sorcerer, Wages of Fear looks profoundly silly in places, especially the unsophisticated ending and brotherhood of laboring men ritual. Like Sorceror, the film features nude Yanamamo Indian ridicule of stupid white guys. One of my favorite movies, anthropologically speaking."

In fact, much like the Friedkin remake (Sorcerer), these are probably favorite, tour-de-force efforts.Without ruining the story, I warn the reader that they will ache at the end of the film. You'll want to know the ""why"" of this pain, but you'll just have to watch.Anyone who was not born in Disneyland should be able to empathize with the characters in this cast.

philpho,"Mar 15, 2016",8/10,"SPOILEROverall this is a classic, no doubt! There are some moments where a bit more attention to logic and detail would have hoisted it so much higher around attention risk and explosives.Why they are transporting Nitro long after Nobel had stabilised it to Dynamite is not clear. Seems it was made 'on site' after the Wells Fargo Office incident of 1866.A bit of Cirque Du Soleil wobbling on OHS nightmare planks whilst loading the goods by the 'workers' presages impending events.Generally though it holds up reasonably well until the boulder in the road.It takes much 'golly gosh darn why us?' before note they note they have explosives... (wow!) which would be the first choice of any road builder.Luigi hops up and 'drills a neat hole with a steel bar the size of a mans forearm in the time it takes Bimba who seems to know his stuff, to wobble precariously off the truck with a jerry can of Nitro, and set himself up for a Nitro Head Spliter by syphoning it orally.The 'rope' suspending the hammer is clearly safety fuse but logical they had some with the Nitro but no detonators. Not 'rope'. Now this is lit and suddenly they remember, having backed up the trucks, the 'rock rain'. Too late. This is where Gerard Depardieu in Jean De Florette wears it. Salaud! But given the size of the flask and the position in the sometime porous rock it would be unlikely to project upwards. And miraculously the road is clear bar a black patch of burnt ah... imagination.Now we get to the Luigi and Bimba crater. No sing of the truck or the guys: given blast is going down and forwards in respect of the truck. No metal nothing. They have I think 42 cans each assume 5 gallon each. So about 800 litres. One lunch thermos full produces blast 1 (rock) whilst 42 cans produces blast B. Um. Blast B looks about right sadly given in 2016 we have many Explosives in Truck Bombs in recent history to compare to.Pedantic? Perhaps but otherwise its brilliant. I recall 'Mario running down Jo' years ago as a kid. It stayed with me. OBriens voice in the office sounds like Daniel Plainview (There Will Be Blood 2007), and the sense of trapped listlessness in the town at the start echoes the despair in Heart of Darkness (Conrad) and recalls parts of The Passenger (Antonioni) and goes some way to explaining the behaviour of the characters. All filmed in France too.The ending? A 'moral ending' with the wages of xyz in his pocket was 'correct' if rather illogical & smacked of 'how can we finish this?' Mario oblivious to basic risk having survived the trauma of the scenario and killing Jo, then literally waltzes off the road with his money.Salaud! Oh yeah, the English subs on my version didn't quite reflect some of the abuse hurled in French.I have worked around but not with explosives in mining and have been in a 'rock rain'. A little attention to detail would have made this great movie 'complete'"
JoellovesMovies,"Nov 14, 2025",8/10,"Plot (spoiler-free)In a forgotten South American village, four men - stranded, broke, and desperate - are offered a chance to earn a large sum of money: transporting volatile nitroglycerin across hundreds of miles of unstable terrain. With death a constant threat at every turn, they accept the job anyway. What begins as a risky assignment slowly turns into a nerve-shredding descent into fear, pride, and psychological unraveling. The film is less about explosions and more about the pressure that builds before one.StrengthsThe Wages of Fear excels in crafting dread from silence. Once the journey begins, the film becomes a masterclass in tension - not through action, but through anticipation. The cinematography is uncomfortably intimate: the camera clings to tires skimming cliffs, hovers beneath axles, and watches every bump in the road like a countdown. There's no music manipulating emotions; the engines and groans of the trucks provide all the atmosphere it needs.Thematically, the film is precise and haunting. It explores what happens when men are reduced to tools of profit - how fear corrodes, and how pride disguises itself as bravery. The slow transformation of characters like Mario and Jo is handled with nuance. Mario, once arrogant and impulsive, gradually hardens, while Jo, full of bravado, deteriorates into paralysis. The dynamic between them - and the quiet dignity of Bimba and Luigi - adds emotional complexity to an already loaded narrative.Weaknesses / AmbivalencesThe film's slow-burning first act might frustrate some viewers. It takes its time establishing the setting and characters, and early performances can feel stilted or distant. But this stillness pays off later, as it deepens the sense of isolation and hopelessness.The ending, too, will divide audiences. While it fits thematically - as a dark mirror to the characters' decisions and illusions of control - it may feel abrupt or needlessly cruel on first watch. But in hindsight, it reinforces the film's existential through-line: survival isn't always salvation.Final VerdictThe Wages of Fear is a tense, merciless film that earns its reputation as a classic. It builds pressure with precision, stripping away all sentimentality until only raw fear and fatalism remain. While its opening may test your patience and its conclusion sting with bitterness, the journey in between is unforgettable. It's not a film that entertains - it exposes. And for that, it lingers."
llallaco,"May 27, 2012",N/A,"After a fire occurs at an oil company, four destitute and desperate European expatriates in an unnamed Latin American country are later hired to transport two truckloads of unstable nitroglycerin across hazardous terrain for the nitroglycerin to be used to extinguish the burning fire.While it may have been extremely suspenseful back in the 1950s, I found it to be predictable, ridiculous, and too action-orientated.I don't understand why it receives the praise that it receives today as it is very dated the suspense is driven entirely by actions with very little character or plot-drive suspense.If it were released today, it would be probably be labelled as a typical popcorn action blockbuster instead of being so highly praised.5/10 stars is my rating."
frankde-jong,"Feb 19, 2021",8/10,"""The wages of fear"" is perhaps the most well known movie of Henry Georges Clouzot, but in my opinion it is not his best.The middle of the film is brilliant but the opening and the ending are a little bit weaker.The opening is a little too long and despite its length it fails to introduce the main characters in a proper way. In the United States the opening was controversial because of the way an American company treats its employees in a Third World country. If Clouzot wanted to make a point about economic imperialsm by big companies Mikhail Kalatozov did a much better job in the opening scenes of his ""Soy Cuba"" (1964).There are a lot of films in which the happy ending feels somehow artificial. ""The wages of fear"" is one of the few films with an artificial ""unhappy ending"", this makes the ending however not less far fetched.Let's concentrate however on the brilliant middle part. Clouzot has been named the French Hitchcock and never more rightly so than in ""The wages of fear"". Hitchcock made a distinction between surprise (a bomb unexpectedly explodes) and suspense (there is a bomb ticking and the spectator knows it (the main character possibly not)). ""The wages of fear"" is suspense in its purest sense. Trucks that are in essence riding bombs crossing the bumpy roads of the jungle."

In desperation, they accept a dangerous but high-paying assignment to transport nitroglycerin to another region three-hundred miles away in order to extinguish an oil well fire. The men are paired off in two vehicles: Frenchmen Mario (Yves Montand) and Jo (Charles Vanel) in one; and Dutchman Bimba (Peter van Eyck) and Italian Luigi (Folco Lulli) in the other. The film is based on the novel by Georges Arnaud.Most of the beginning scenes before the main action are good but some feel rather long. The characterization in this section is also less interesting and underdeveloped compared to what follows. They include Mario's overly lovestruck girlfriend, Linda (Véra Clouzot); and a heartless, greedy, one-dimensional American oil-company executive, Bill O'Brien (William Tubbs).Another criticism of the film is that an important event at its conclusion seems unnecessarily harsh and sadistic with a dose of shadenfreude toward one of the characters. But these flaws are well dominated by the film's many strengths which take place during the treacherous journey.Some scenes in the main section are long and they need to be. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does a superb job in paying attention to small details that extend the tension and suspense. Other directors would likely not have succeeded as well.And the actors playing the four truck-drivers are exceptional. Van Eyck stands out in a scene requiring rescuing skills. And the many conflict scenes between Mario and Jo were so good, they could have been part of a separate movie on their own. The character revelations in these scenes were amazing.Highly recommended.RATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:Directing by Henri-Georges ClouzotActing Ensemble (the four actors playing the truck drivers)dbamateurcritic (wordpress)"
tonypeacock-1,"Jan 4, 2025",9/10,"I actually stumbled upon viewing this film by accident when studying a film I want to watch in future that is supposedly a 'remake' of this (Sorcerer (1977)). Before watching said Sorcerer film I thought I better watch its inspiration. A French/Italian film from 1953 based on the novel of the same name. It also is listed in a films you must watch book so that was another reason.Stumbled, this is a great film that I would recommend to any cinephile indeed anybody. The black and white photography and foreign language film in parts with subtitles may not immediately appear appealing to everybody but this film has a lot of merits.The plot is basically you have poor men in a South American country who are basically trapped because of their location and poverty, Unable to 'escape' the town because they cannot afford the only way out it appears, an airstrip.The only employment is from a US based oil company who mine for oil. However when an oil field explodes into a fireball the only way to cap the well is using nitroglycerin, a highly flammable material. However the nitroglycerin is 500km away across jungle terrain and there is no safe way of transporting the nitroglycerin to the oil fire. It can only be transported via road in jerrycans. However the roads in that art of the world are lethal and nobody in there right minds would undertake the task.However four of the poor men featured at the start of the film agree to undertake the lethal task for the princely sum of $2000 USD per driver.At this point the relatively long film starts getting really engrossing as the men start the task and overcome several obstacles en route leading to a grandstand final. I won't reveal any more than that.As well as the obstacles on route the men must learn to trust each other and use each other for assistance in order to get the job done.The film has a slightly political overtone though exploring Capitalism and Communist values."
Jus10B,"May 8, 2021",9/10,Double feature of Clouzot. Watched this right after Les Diaboliques. Pretty sure I can speak French now. Wages Of Fear is an enthralling story. Great acting fuels this story along a highway to oily hell! Loved it. Especially the ending!!!
zzhhhqing,"Jun 5, 2020",9/10,"The two parts of the inescapable town and the death trip are used to show the cruel world. The ugliness of human nature and the benefits of money are most vividly displayed here. There are several scenes that feature close-up parts and harsh environments. ! The director used all means to ravage the audience's ability to bear, even at the last minute, without loosening the tight strings."
Doylenf,"Oct 13, 2011",N/A,"To borrow from Col. Needham's synopsis:""In the South American jungle supplies of nitroglycerin are needed at a remote oil field. The oil company pays four men to deliver the supplies in two trucks. A tense rivalry develops between the two sets of drivers and on the rough remote roads the slightest jolt can result in death.""And thus, the wheels are set for a road trip you'll never forget--provided you're able to sit through the nerve-racking suspense director Clouzet sets up once the wheels hit the road.The story is really a combination of character study and shattering suspense once it gets underway. As some have already said, it does take its time to set up the situation. Once the set-up is made, it's an endurance test some viewers will find hard to bear. Obstacles are thrown into the driver's way at every turn, including a pool of oil that one of the men has to wade through in order to help truck driver Yves Montand get across it. What happens in this sequence is the high point of suspense and horror, easily one of the most difficult situations the audience has to sit through in order to reach the downbeat ending. I feel sure American audiences would have appreciated eliminating the final turn of events for the surviving driver, but that's the only objection I have to the plot's final twist.The grim tale is told in the most realistic manner possible and the cast is excellent. In a way, it's the sort of achievement that John Huston had with the men facing difficult obstacles in ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre.""Summing up: Unbearable suspense makes it hard to sit through once the nitroglycerin trucks are on the road because the nail-biting suspense is overwhelmingly powerful. A masterpiece of its kind."
arthur_tafero,"Jan 10, 2023",8/10,"Wages of Fear is a classic film that has unbelievable levels of suspense. Why is it suspenseful? Well, if you have a cargo of high explosives in the back of your truck that are unstable and may explode at any second if you hit a pothole or big bump, you will be driving at 8-10 miles an hour and be sweating every minute of the way. You might be making thousands of dollars, but you are also risking your life on a minute by minute basis. That is the basic premise of the film. Why would anyone do this? Desperate people who need money would; and there are plenty of those around. This film was so good that it was made many years later as Sorcerer, with a much bigger budget. Both films are great, so catch either one."
sandnair87,"Mar 22, 2015",9/10,"One of the most deeply and disturbingly nihilistic films ever made, as well as one of the most heart-pounding thrillers on record, Henri-Georges Clouzot's The Wages of Fear is as much about the origin of manufactured fear as it is about the folly of courage that feeds on it. But as lofty and abstract as Clouzot's allegory may be, his execution is vibrantly physical and immediate. Turning the screws with a relentlessness that impresses even in this age of the ruthless, high-tech thriller, Clouzot strings together situations of vividly, almost sadistically imagined danger.Set in the sunbaked, impoverished, dusty, fictional banana republic of Las Piedras in Latin America that is under the thumb of an American oil company, 'The Wages of Fear' adopts a fable-like form. The town is bursting with desperate foreign derelicts, stranded there without money and who will do anything to earn the price of a ticket back to civilization. When the American oil company needs two truckloads of volatile nitroglycerine to put out a runaway fire at a remote oil-drilling site, a desperate foursome belonging to different points on the map is hired to man the two trucks for 300 miles through a treacherous terrain, at the end of which liberation lies. The wages of their fears will be salvation. The trucks are equipped with nothing more than ordinary spring suspensions. They are only given a 50-50 chance, but are offered good pay ($2,000 for one week of work). Now the excitement begins!When Clouzot's quartet decides to take up the job, the motive is greed and the results are as black a vision of human infidelity as any. The cliff-edge tension is nerve-wracking as they stumble upon one roadblock after another – a hairpin curve, a boulder on the road, passing through an obstructing pool of oil, riding for long stretches with explosives on roads that are bumpy and finally their own stress. Henri-Georges Clouzot successfully conveys both- situations that shiver with ice- cold suspense and the downbeat theme of fear and its various manifestations, with exceptional stewardship.The Wages of Fear is a frantic, vicious, existentialist howl that not only manages to laugh; it goes grinning into the void. You can do nothing but sit there in sheer awe, waiting for the screen to explode!"
searchanddestroy-1,"Dec 1, 2022",10/10,"The best French adventure drama ever, and the best movie from Henri George Clouzot, besides LE CORBEAU of course. But beware, if you remember the climax, it spoils much pleasure for a second viewing, so please, never tell it to anyone who has not seen it yet. The best ironic ending that I remember of in my entire movie buff life. Dialogues, characters symphony, relationship between each of them, is terrific, Charles Vanel even better than Montand. The he man, the tough man who is secretly a coward, very impressive character. Tension all long the movie. An absolute must see French gem, that William Friedkin has directed a remake. A bit different but more than worth watching. Besides, Yves Montand has a scene here, rather close of another one he will have in his further role in LA MENACE. Now, I hope I have not spoiled the end...."
kosmasp,"May 27, 2020",10/10,"I have to admit, watching this, I never even thought this could be considered political (or rather communist). But I can see it in hindisght, painting industries and therefor the US to some extend or the western world in general in a bad light. Having said that, this starts off quite easy and slow. Until the real journey begins we get to see a lot of character stuff. Things we may not see in modern day movies - maybe.Having said that, the movie almost got me completely by surprise when a couple of minutes in we see a cleavage shot. Now I'm not prude, so I wasn't bothered by it. I was however surprised to see such a scene, that was borderline nudity. Then again the man whom that effort was aimed at, wasn't too excited about it. There are some who even attested the movie may have some homoerotic tendencies. I didn't really see that, I'd attest that to male bonding, but maybe it is there. It doesn't really do the movie any harm.Having said that, there are quite some really good effects (one involving a leg, that really looked quite real). The movie might end on a note the viewer may expect, even if it almost seems unnecessary. Then again, it's the best way to end it - this really is great filmmaking and acting. Even if the slow pace may turn some viewers off"

Gilly-13,"Mar 9, 2001",N/A,"This is an example of film with great cinematic and artistic appeal but one that is uproariously funny if you've ever worked a day in your life.  I understand these expatriates weren't supposed to be masters of common carriage, but, if not for the life-and-death tragedy, this might have been shortened to an episode of the Howard, Fine, and Howard Delivery Service. ""That can of nitroglycerine is for the OTHER wall, you dummy.  <slap, slap>""I had to work hard to concentrate on the more profound issues this film addressed, and it did a well-photographed, insightful job of addressing those compelling issue of that post-war era of film making (e.g., personal courage, capitalist colonialism, and, less successfully, gender issues). The hardest job of the film for me, however, was not delivering the nitro, but overlooking the hilariously inept antics in which this zany little troupe of down-and-outers-fallen-on-hard-times got themselves entangled in the physical aspects of the plot.No, a square handkerchief lying in the road has no meaning whatsoever to any truck driver in any country.  No, a bumpy road is not smoother at 40 m.p.h. No, you don't stand behind the tailgate of a truck while directing the driver to back over you.  No, you can't chip a 30-inch deep hole in a rock with a spare crankshaft.  No, porous rock with visible cracks won't hold nitroglycerine like a cocktail glass.  No, you can't tie a knot in wire rope.  No, you don't suck fluid, especially the highly explosive variety, into a syphon tube with your mouth.  No, the explosion of a truckload of nitroglycerine would not leave a pond-size depression, it would remove the entire face of the slope.  No, crude oil is not the consistency of cafe au lait.  And no, carrying an open jerry can of nitroglycerine precariously for several hundred yards PAST its cover AND the truck it was nested in is not suspenseful, it's frustratingly stupid.If you can get past the unintentional physical slapstick, however, there is an underlying good movie, although implausibly scripted to the point of absurdity."
Tweetienator,"Aug 31, 2023",8/10,"A couple of days ago I put The Wages of Fear again on my screen and was enchanted by this masterful piece again: suspense galore, the clash of interesting characters, a fine production. The story: after an oil well catches fire, four men are hired to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin to the oil well, where the explosives are needed to extinguish the flames.Every time I watch this one I can feel the heat in many senses. Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Folco Lulli and Peter Van Eyck show some fine acting skills and are a match for a classic like The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (starring Humphrey Bogart). The story is based on the novel Le Salaire de la peur by Georges Arnaud (published 1950). No doubt, this one is a classic piece of French cinematic wonders. Watch at least once in your life."
avik-basu1889,"Jul 4, 2017",8/10,"The film starts off with a setting which is very reminiscent of the opening to Huston's 'Treasure of Sierra Madre' in the way that we meet a number of Europeans stuck in a South American town where literally nothing happens. They have no job prospects and they don't have the financial means required to leave the deadbeat town. Although the opening act of the film is a bit uneven,it still works to make the viewer well acquainted with the characters. Henri- Georges Clouzot manages to convey the utter disenchantment and poverty of the characters, which helps to underline why these men would feel desperate to find a way out of this town and will probably go to any lengths to materialise that. There is also a very clear anti-American capitalism statement being made in the opening act. The Southern Oil Company(SOC) who end up employing the men for the central mission is portrayed as this monstrously exploitative entity that doesn't care about people's lives as long as their materialistic oil needs are met. It is also interesting to note that the characters themselves remain pretty unlikable in the first part of the film. But when the come together in their mission and as we spend time with them on the road and fear for their lives, they become more and more engaging.As soon as the 4 primary characters jump on the trucks and start the mission, the film completely changes. It becomes a fascinatingly exciting, edge of the seat thrill-fest as the characters encounter and overcome a series of obstacles. This was my first viewing of a Clouzot film, but I can clearly see why he was nicknamed the 'French Hitchcock'. Clouzot's tour de force direction in each of these obstacle sequences is very reminiscent of Hitchcock. He ratchets up the tension through a combination of various elements like meticulous use of silence and ambient noises, precise camera placement and absolutely pitch perfect editing. I think every single person watching this film will at at least some point or another find themselves on the edge of the seat during the film due to the sheer effectiveness of the white-knuckle-ride experience that ' The Wages of Fear' offers.A clear theme that is being explored in the film is the irony and the mysterious ways of the concept of fate and mortality. The manner in which all the characters meet their respective fates in the film are genuinely unpredictable, sudden and unquestionably ironic.In conclusion, 'The Wages of Fear' is a must watch for everyone as it has something to offer for fans of a wide range of genres. Even though I think the opening act is comparatively a little uneven, however in an overall sense, the film is a knockout and has directorial mastery written all over it. Highly Recommended."
bladefd,"Jun 13, 2025",9/10,"THE WAGES OF FEAR is a psychological drama from France about survival and perseverance through desperation. It's based on a 1950 French novel 'Le Salaire de la Peur' by Georges Arnaud, who wrote the screenplay. This is an edge-of-your-seat no-holds-barred thriller that feels fresh, despite being from 1953. It's also original and unpredictable from beginning to end-I don't know of any similar movie. If I had known this masterpiece existed, I would have viewed it years earlier. I believe this is well ahead of its time by a director I've never heard of-Henri-Georges Clouzot. I want to check out his other top films in the future.In a 1950s South American town, the local oil company hires four men to bring two large shipments of nitroglycerin by truck to an oil field on fire. The nitroglycerin must arrive fast because lives are at stake. Success means $2,000 in US dollars, which would change their lives. Adjusted for inflation, it's approximately $25,000, a life-changing sum in a small town in a poor country. They pair Mario, the cocky main character, with the pompous, tough veteran, Jo. Mario himself is an unemployed low-life in love with Linda, a local maid. Jo is a former gangster who doesn't take crap from anyone, but they soon become friends. In the other truck are Luigi, a hard worker dying from mesothelioma, and Bimba, a tough German whose father died doing forced labor in a Nazi salt mine. They are in it for the money. While driving carrying explosives in the rear, the two duos form a rivalry and compete to arrive first. The road itself is a series of challenges they must surmount without blowing themselves.The filming techniques and production here are sensational. Fascinating acting, expert script, sharp editing, cinematography, and tense direction will leave you on the edge. Initially, I was unsure of the film's direction, but your patience is worth it! The pacing picks up after the first half hour, once the four receive their truck assignments. It becomes a tense hour and 45 minutes afterward. The attention to detail and depth of the plot and characters amazed me. This movie explores themes such as survival, sacrifice, desperation, and determination under extreme pressure. I didn't give a 9 rating because of the first 30 minutes and the ending. I can't say much about either without spoilers.Some interesting trivia tidbits. Various issues emerged during the production. That includes heavy rain across France during the shoot, where they built the town for this picture. Director Clouzot broke his ankle, and his wife, Vera Clouzot, who plays Linda, became ill during filming. The production went over budget. Winter arrived, forcing them to put the production on hold for six months. American censors cut several scenes because the American oil company that was shown took advantage of the labor workers, which was seen as anti-American by censors. This movie won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival. Though originally in black and white, the studio colorized it in 1996.Would I recommend this? Yes, 100%, if you don't mind subtitles. The subtitles were easy to follow. This film is a must-watch for fans of action thrillers. This was remade as SORCERER in 1977 in English, starring Roy Scheider, and I plan on watching that someday. But the original is difficult to match. I rarely rewatch films, but WAGES OF FEAR is worth a rewatch. My rating is 8.5/10.*Any trivia facts were obtained from IMDB's trivia page and plot/basic history/names information from Wiki."
drqshadow-reviews,"Aug 12, 2024",8/10,"Hired by a corrupt American oil company to transport volatile chemicals across dangerous terrain, four men risk life and limb in pursuit of a rich payday. The job's much too risky for the refinery's usual, unionized employees, but these louts are just desperate enough to throw caution to the wind and wager everything on their own driving skills. They've had their fill of kicking around a dusty, barren, South American nowhere town, waiting for work to materialize, and the mere thought of a big score has them spending the money before they've left the garage.The first act takes a while to find its footing, but once the rubber hits the road this is a master class in compounding suspense. Splitting time behind the wheel in two large, under-prepared equipment trucks, the men are soon at each other's throats, stressed by the trying conditions and ever-present threat of mortal disaster. They weren't exactly friendly before this endeavor, starting fights and waving weapons in a bar the night before, and the smothering anxiety only serves to fan those flames. Together, they're forced to wind around a steep, jagged mountain road, cross a field of divots at high speed and slide through a lake of spilled oil, doing their best to cooperate (and often failing at that) while remaining hyper-aware of their payload's touchy nature. The jerrycans of nitroglycerin that line their beds are so fickle, even a bad bounce could blow them all to kingdom come.You just know that, eventually, something's going wrong. It's tough not to nibble a fingernail as the twin teams navigate one obstacle after another, balanced precariously on the metaphorical tightrope. When disaster finally strikes, the film doesn't knock our socks off. It focuses on the shockwave over the shock and awe, a whisper of rushing air that sweeps crumbled tobacco from a half-rolled cigarette and then departs, like spirits headed into the afterlife. It seemed destined that only one truck would finish this adventure - the oil company suspected as much - but the real question is, can the survivors still find a way to band together and overcome? And, if so, at what cost?"

There were several scenes where I could feel the tension and the film managed to stay relevant even for modern day standards where we are used to seeing fast chasing vehicles in the big screen do all sort of stunts. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot proved that you don't need to rely exclusively on visual effects to deliver a suspenseful movie, it can be done through great story telling and good editing. There is a reason why this film won the Golden Palm at the Cannes Film Festival and the Golden Bear at the Berlin Film Festival. It is very well directed and has some great performances. I did not expect to enjoy this film as much as I did, but from the setting to the exposition of the action everything was done with care. Growing up in South America during the 80's, I felt like this village was really from a small town in South America. The amount of detailing that production took for creating this village was spot on. The film might suffer from pacing as it is two and a half hours long and the first 45 minutes are setting up the characters, but I loved every minute of this movie. Yves Montand was impressive in the lead role, and just had that charisma that an action star needs. Charles Vanel also shines here and has great chemistry with Montand. Their teaming up was one of the key successes of the movie. Peter van Eyck's character was simply cool and I'm sure the Hannibal Smith character from the A team was inspired by him. My only complaint for this film would be for VÃ©ra Clouzot's character, Linda. Her Spanish was terrible and they should have hired an actress who spoke Spanish. But everything else about this film is just impressive and there is a reason why this is on the top 250 list of best films of all time.""""Wherever there's oil there's Americans."""" """

Only lately that I realize that it was based on the much acclaimed French movie, The Wages of Fear.  I recently saw the restored version of this and even though I enjoyed it I cannot see where it is supposedly better than the Sorcerer. To me the movie is too long to get to the point of having to move the nitro. Also I did not really get the point as to why all these people were there in that city which was nowhere as awful as in the Sorcerer.   However, I did enjoy it and will watch it again sometime."

Mario and 3 others are offered $2,000 each if they will transfer nitro glycerine to an oil well that has caught fire. The slightest vibration or increase in heat will set it off - it is incredibly dangerous, but all the men desperately need the money and take on what will be a shattering existential crisis.Easily up there as a movie great with tension you could cut with a knife. There are a number of incidents which I won't give away that seem so intense you you can barely watch. These are handled brilliantly by Clouzot that they seem completely real and you can imagine the actors really going through it to get these great scenes.The actors are universally excellent with Montand giving one of his finest performances although he is equalled, maybe even surpassed by Charles Vanel as his co driver. To see these 2 men's characters change so much throughout the film is extraordinary, particularly in comparison to the excellent opening scenes in the village where their characters behave so differently to that which they will dramatically become.

ramsri81,"Jan 10, 2008",9/10,"This movie has supposedly won the 1953 Grand Prize at Cannes. The plot is revolving around a group of men who are penniless at a place (supposedly some South American Country) and accept a dangerous job of transporting some explosive chemicals through the rugged country. I was not quite sure of the setting of the movie, whether they were trying to name the title on poverty under which the men were or the adventure comparing with the risk of losing their life. Either ways the movie is full of nice scenes of camaraderie. The outdoor sets for this movie is extensive, and the depiction of the 1950's South America isn't that easy. All the places give us a very nice and nostalgic view on how beautiful the place was. The European task force consisting Messrs Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel act important roles in the movie. The movie is about the conflicts of the actors needing money for different reason as for the emotions they go though in course of their journey to the land of no return. Really a master piece and even though many claim Sorcerer is a better movie than this (it is the 1971 remake of this movie) I personally feel this is a better movie. I rate this one 9/10"

TYLERdurden74,"Nov 9, 1998",N/A,"42. WAGES OF FEAR (french-italian-thriller, 1953) A young Corsican, Mario (Yves Montand), an aging Parisian, a German and a fatally ill Italian are stranded (penniless) in a backward South American village. Close to the edge of damnation they all desperately seek a way out. The owner of an American-based fuel company offers the men $2 000 to transport 2 truckloads of nitroglycerin over a 300 treacherous-mountainous miles. Though the feat is wrought with danger, the men are desperate to get their money no matter what.Critique: This is regarded as the greatest suspense thriller ever made, and once you see it you'll probably agree. Director Henri-Georges Clouzot adapted the screenplay from a novel by Georges Arnaud, creating a totally realistic world full of poverty and despair. The people living in this wretched part of the world aren't fazed, however, as their spirits remain strong. The principal's efforts to rise above it all, though heroic, prove ultimately fatal.Clouzot creates a couple of tremendously unforgettable scenes: the men pushing their trucks over dilapidated bridges, across mountains, broken down roads, and an oil well. Like no other film since we feel the desperation and dismay the characters go through. The ending is a bit of a letdown, further reinforcing Clouzot's pessimistic nature.QUOTE: Jo: ""I'm trying to remember. The fence. . .what there was behind the fence. There's nothing!"""
alicecbr,"Aug 3, 2003",N/A,"Since Hollywood can't get original these days, always seeking for remakes, here's one that's topical as well.  What men won't do for oil: ""where there is oil, there are Americans"", the natives say in this movie that shows what men will do for money.The horrible experiences they go through over this precipitious roads with rotting wood supports and huge pot=holes awaiting them all the way is quite worse than a horror movie, because this is believable.  The oil fires could have come out of Gulf War I, and some of the things that happen here in this poverty-stricken land where Americans are hated could well happen to us in Iraq.  That war is not over, and won't be so long as we occupy that company, a lesson seemingly unlearned from the British or this movie, for that matter.Yves Montand and the Italian fellow do excellent jobs in portraying toughness and friendship.  Yves acts the part of a dumb punk well, quickly turning from one friend to the other when things seem to be more advantageous.  His hilarity at the end is foolish.  A few things are irrational, as the fact that the only thing left from one explosion is a cigarette holder.....doesn't compute.But the suspense laid down by this director is masterful.  I can't imagine why no one has tried making another version since 1953.  The acting by all 4 is magnificent, and the poverty of the area is exquisitely portrayed.  And yes, the analogy of the bugs trying to escape from their strings is not lost, in fact, stated by one of the guys so desperate to get out of their trap.When you're used to Yves Montand as the suave lover, seeing him as a rough punk, sometimes compassionate, more often brutal, you know what a good actor he was.  The love-struck woman was WAYYY out of place, and had the same last name as the director.  Actress she wasn't, maybe she was his wife.HIghly unusual film, well worth buying.  When my blood pressure comes down, I'll try to watch it again.  If you have problems with heights , you might not want to watch it, though."
cintact,"Apr 25, 2012",N/A,"Ah, this is why we love IMDb. A cheap snuff film posing as an art film, somehow manages to rake in some decent ratings from viewers who have the audacity to voice their uninformed opinions, which mostly involve obsessing over how believable something is in every technical way possibly, while a truly suspenseful film like WAGES OF FEAR garners a mere above average B rating score. This is an example of a suspense film done well. One must appreciate Clouzot's knack for drawing his audience into the drama. From the scenes at the cantina to the road scenes, his mise en scene is rich and fully realized. One can easily smell the danger in the air and the texture of the road. The characters are strongly developed to the point where we actually care about what happens to them. This to me is much more compelling than a chase sequence. It's the silent tension created from one who is trying to manage what he may not have the power to control."
Profess Abronsi,"Feb 7, 2001",N/A,"This really is an excellent film; well worth seeing, at least once.  Quite simply, a forgotten gem (that audiences in the U.S. would need subtitles to watch).  The fact that these men driving the trucks could die at any second during the journey, plays on the mind to such an extent - I think that's the film's forte."
Edsn,"Jan 15, 2001",N/A,"After watching this film I was struck by the old saying, ""the more things change, the more they remain the same"". The attitude displayed by the oil company foreman toward the well being of his employees is still widespread today. The film had some very taut scenes that, although a bit dated by todays standards, still play very well. One scene involving a pool of oil would have been a fairly daring depiction for its time and even now can make you think about what you would have done given the same circumstances. The only thing that mars this film is the ending. I have no problem with downbeat endings but the manner in which this one took place struck me as unbelievable. The ending brought down, by some degree, a well written movie. Recommended, especially for the rock scene."
dfwforeignbuff,"Jan 6, 2010",N/A,"The Wages of Fear (1953) Henri Georges Clouzot (the French ""Hitchock"" who directed this thriller as well as wrote the script) gives us this tense and suspenseful drama about four men so desperate for freedom that they willingly risk their lives to deliver a dangerous cargo. In a small, isolated, hot and dusty Central American village, there's only one thing to do: dream of getting out. An opportunity for escape presents itself -- but only to those with nerves of steel. An American oil company has offered to pay big bucks to get two trucks filled with nitroglycerin over to a well fire. The catch: the unpaved terrain contains enough bumps and crags to make the unstable material explode... and instantly kill the driver. Nonetheless, the company has many applicants hungry for work, and a quartet of the coolest are chosen. But even these stalwart men will discover that fear of their deadly payload can ignite even the most frozen emotion. The film has a strong cool theme of fear and its manifestations. This is the restored full length version. Now this film works better as a thriller than as a political comment. Originally much was said about the films anti American sentiments. This is a strong exciting involving film. From my point of view (of watching a lot of foreign films) I wish he had hired some actors from Spain or Mexico that spoke real Spanish rather than use Americans and their Gringo Spanish learned lines. Yves Montand, is in this film in his first dramatic role. Charles Vanel gives an excellent portrait of an aging man feeling fear and resignation. William Friedkin remade ""The Wages of Fear"" as ""Sorcerer"" in 1977 and it was a technically better film as he has much more resources. This film has great black and white cinematography and shows us the French master in its arranging of scenes and editing. It would not be fair to mention how this picture ends, other than to say that the conclusion is deliberate and ironical by today's today's standards. 4 stars"
estayunita,"Mar 11, 2022",N/A,"I think this is gonna be my favorite French film ever! This masterpiece made without any modern technology, can you imagine?It's also so heartbreaking, and it made me in tears. This film successfully blows my soul how people survive just for even money. This classic is representation how life sometimes so unfair."
sds-81227,"Apr 24, 2015",N/A,"Whoever it may be to rightly claim that he invented the action thriller genre (Méliès, I suppose), Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""Le salaire de la peur"" is an indispensable milestone on the exciting route to the best films of that kind in the 70's, 80's and nowadays. In its tenseness, as symbolized by the danger of explosion of the lorries' loads, it has hardly been surpassed.The plot is perfectly worked out from start to end, the leading players act in some of their best parts ever, the (almost) absence of music supports the brutal realism and the consequent choice of authentic outdoor settings contributed a lot to the film's deserved success. Historically, it ranges between neorealismo and nouvelle vague, and yet it is its pure action and suspense that make it worth watching for younger audiences who wouldn't go in for just the artistic way. - Only flaw I can see is the curious, rather artificial change in Vanel's character which has no comprehensible motivation, at least for me whenever I see it.Apart from that, Clouzot's wife Véra (also well-known from his ""Les diaboliques"") plays to the ""most breathtaking angles"" gallery when she bows down to scrub the floor of Dario Moreno's gin joint. It's a man's world after all and there are male perspectives on human survival only. Well, it's existentialism, mates. Altogether, the black and white photography is gripping. The gun scene between Lulli and Vanel is one of the best montages in film history, and there is more excellent editing in ""Salaire"" (including the finale) that completely fits the hot atmosphere."
board-5,"Apr 26, 2008",N/A,"Good idea for a screenplay,better than average screenplay,decent film finally.I had seen the remake too,at the moment I can not see too big difference,among them at quality.Well watch this as a classic.The acting is perfect,the two french actors filling the screen as they have to,but the supporting cast are also did a great job.The direction was not every time at the top,but we had seen worst.Well I still don't know,what time can add to this movie,but the IMDb-s top 250 list says for today the people says is't more than 8/10 in average.I will kiss my mother to sad,see this cause I think this will good for you,maybe it was in 1996 as far as I can remember,I will tell further if I can."
