ebiros2,"Oct 17, 2005",10/10,"The movie started out pretty innocently, and for the first 20 minutes, I was wondering where the movie was going. Then it started to happen. The horrible cruelty of concentration camps. Oskar Schindler is an example of a man that no matter what the situation, there are people who won't go along with the cruelty of society. I'm sure it took courage to do what he did, because one wrong move and you'll be dead.Movie brought to life this great man who really shouldn't be forgotten, and thanks to Steven Spielberg, I think he'll be remembered for generations to come. Movie like this should be made once in a while. Not that movie should be used for evangelistic purposes but some story should be told well, and movie is still the best vehicle to do so.I still think that Oskar Shindler's last words in this movie was one of the best dialog in movie history - ""Why did I keep this badge ? I could have saved a person. Why did I keep this car ?, I could have saved five more people."""
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 26, 2023",10/10,"Businessman Oskar Schindler saved the lives of many Jews, by employing them in his factories, this saving them from going to The Concentration Camps.This was, and will forever be, one of the best films ever made, not just the ultimate story of The Holocaust, but truly as masterpiece, one of the best.If you can sit through it without being moved to the point of tears, you're made of stronger stuff than I am, the atrocities committed on those innocent people will never be forgotten. The realisation here is chilling.The film's pacing is quite remarkable, it's a three hour film that flashes by quickly, but it's three hours that will live with you forever, some of the scenes will rightly never be forgotten.What has always struck me, is the way that everything became normalised, people first losing their businesses, their homes, their freedom, and ultimately their lives, it is truly one of the bleakest points in human history, that's what this film details perfectly.The Cinematography is incredible, it's understated, but perfect, fits the film perfectly, the sheer scale of it is so impressive. The scene with the little girl in the red coat has always been one of the standout moments.No wonder it won a string of Oscars, the acting is outstanding throughout, I have always regarded this is Liam Neeson's best ever performance, but Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes are remarkable also.It's a film that informs, moves, and makes you think in equal measures. If you think it's going to be too much, I'd say this, it is very upsetting at times, but it does also give some real glimpses of hope, the remarkable human spirit.A jaw dropping, powerful movie, it's one of the best ever made.10/10."
EVON1TY,"Mar 2, 2023",9/10,"As you may know there is lots of World War II movies. Some of them shows you the worst parts of war, this one is doing something better.Shows you the war is bad for everyone. Shows you een the little kindness is the greatest thing. Shows you ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entirely.""I saw so many World War II movies, non of them gave me these feelings. Most of them are just too sided with USA. Some of them just made with fictional characters. And I don't know how but some of them says war is a good thing if you're shooting bad people.Besides one of the greatest historical Screenplay, the Acting Performances just superb. I don't imagine any better casting for any character. They all chosen well. With Liam Neeson's Schindler, Ben Kingsley's Stern and the great villain Ralp Fiennes' Amon Goth.Scores is the soul of the movie. John Williams mades you feel that.Cinematography is too great, watching this movie with these colors makes the movie too much realistic. I don't know how is it doing that. I know some of the movies are trying that when flashback scenes are coming, but most of them are not being successful at.Art Direction and Set Decoration is also too varied. They managed to do an enormous job. You feel the greatness in the movie with varied places and objects."
vtburns,"Dec 11, 2000",N/A,"I have only ever seen this film once, I only ever want to see this film once and I will only ever need to see this film once. It is etched on my mind. I, like many others, left in silence.  I could not imagine inventing a critical analysis of this film, picking small points of detail or of style, or even scoring points off the Director. It stands alone as a monumental piece of cinema, a magnificent accomplishment."
Fella_shibby,"Sep 9, 2013",10/10,"Schindler's List is undoubtedly the best Holocaust film ever made. There just isn't anything like this film. Various other films have tried to show the true horrors of the Holocaust, but none of them succeeded the way that Schindler's List did. Schindler's List is a difficult film to watch. When you see the true atrocities of the Holocaust, your jaw drops. When you see the pain that all of the innocent people were going through, the only thing you can do is cry. The true goal of all Holocaust films is to make you feel sorrowful, and Schindler's List did that to me. If you want to see the best depiction of the Holocaust, make your way towards Schindler's List.
Me n my kids cried during the pit scene."
crawdidd424,"May 3, 2002",10/10,"This Movie was sensational. It was a piece of art along with being informational. It told people about the holocaust, and it also told people about the human spirit. It shows how people can just triumph over anything with just some help from one person The things that Spielberg did with the movie was incredible too. The black and white was genius, and how he had the little girl in red and the fire was phenuminal. I have never seen anything like it, Schindler's List is beyond all words."
arahansehrawat,"Sep 1, 2017",10/10,"Schindler's genius is in bribing, scheming, conning. He knows nothing about running a factory and finds Itzhak Stern, a Jewish accountant, to handle that side of things. Stern moves through the streets of Krakow, hiring Jews for Schindler. Because the factory is a protected war industry, a job there may guarantee longer life. The relationship between Schindler and Stern is developed by Spielberg with enormous subtlety. At the beginning of the war, Schindler wants only to make money... and at the end he wants only to save ""his"" Jews. We know that Stern understands this. But there is no moment when Schindler and Stern bluntly state what is happening, perhaps because to say certain things aloud could result in death."
Instant_Palmer,"Apr 10, 2022",10/10,"Leaves one speechless - Moving, somber, and horrifying. One of Humankind's worst moments - Something no one should ever forget. This is filmmaking at its finest. Even with 7 Oscars, deserved more. On par with the greatest films ever made. Certainly cemented Steven as one of the greatest filmmakers to walk the planet. A personal labor by Steven, it is clearly something he felt compelled to do, and it shows in the intricate detail of every scene. ""Schindler's List"" is nearly flawless in every category. A must-see film for reasons beyond entertainment.🙏"
SnoopyStyle,"Mar 23, 2014",10/10,"Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson) is a social climbing opportunistic womanizing German businessman. He charms important Nazis, and gets access to limitless Jewish labor. He gets Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) as his right hand man, and Jewish money to pay for his business. He provides the front. Using black market deals and advantageous connections, he becomes rich and powerful. Stern works tirelessly to save people. Even as the Jews are rounded up to Plaszow labor camp under the command of unstable Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes), Schindler is able to befriend the mad commander.This is probably the most important movie of director Steven Spielberg's career. At least it's the most important for him. Based on the true story, Spielberg uses all his movie making skills to create this iconic movie. The black and white provides starkness and thankfully a little bit of distance from the horrible events. Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley are the perfect duo. Ralph Fiennes gives a complex performance as the mad commander. The shock of the horrors of the Holocaust is expertly done. When I first saw it in the theater, I couldn't help sob a little when Schindler breaks down at the end."
Gordon-11,"Oct 19, 2009",N/A,"This film tells the story of Nazi officer Oskar Schindler, who secretly saved hundreds of Jewish people from concentration camps.I have wanted to watch ""Schindler's List"" for years, but could not bring myself to do so because I don't want to be disappointed. ""Schindler's List"" is phenomenally powerful and effective in portraying the historical atrocities. I believe no one can keep their eyes dry from Schindler's List"". The scene involving mothers running after trucks of children is particularly memorable. The final farewell scene is very emotional for me. It is rare achievement, but ""Schindler's List"" is a three hour film that feels too short."
Nephertity,"Dec 21, 1999",10/10,"Schindler's List is the ever best movie I have seen within my whole life period of time.Steven Spielberg is the unique man who really does deserve the definition ""genius child"" of cinema.Thank you Steven Spielberg, for all the wonderful vision you have brought into cinema world and thus into our lives..."
Mike-139,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"Well what can I say? It took Spielberg nearly 20 years before they would acknowledge his brilliance, so he just had to create probably the greatest and most important film that this earth has probably seen. Try and pick a flaw in it, I dare you."
tornikesvanidze,"Aug 17, 2017",9/10,"Fantastic screening of the bloody history. Watching Schindler's List gives rise to know what means the 'TOP CLASS FILM', it's impossible to make better film in this subject matter. Steven Spielberg is a genius. Liam Neelson and Ralph Fiennes are showing us how talented and great actors are they. Well done to the cast and crew of this film."
caelan_macdonald,"Jun 10, 2016",10/10,"An incredibly insightful film concerning the Holocaust. Spielberg recreates the story of German businessman Oskar Schindler - a man that would not typically be associated with savings the lives of people, as far as the Nazis were concerned, considered to be enemies of the State. Such a contrast makes the film so moving combining the horrors of what was experienced by the ethnic minorities under Nazi persecution with insight as to the atrocities that occurred in the gas chambers and ghettos to the generous, gentle nature of respected German businessman Oskar Schindler.A tribute that will remain to be one of the most encapsulating films based around a remarkable man saving thousands of lives amongst one of the most devastating regimes witnessed by human history. A film that is to never be forgotten just as the Holocaust never will be."
necrocris2000,"Jun 21, 2017",10/10,"In my opinion one of the best drama movies that i ever saw. This movie shows how people are, 99% evil, bad, cruel, and the others 1% kind, peaceful, helpful. One man can save thousands, only because ""he's a good guy"" ! This movie also shows how were the Germans when they occupied Poland"
zaremskya-23761,"Oct 23, 2017",10/10,"The Holocaust is a dark and touchy subject for many. Many believed it never happened, despite meticulous records kept by the Nazis themselves. Those who lived through it were scarred forever, and even now can barely bring themselves to discuss its horrors. Despite the controversy around the event, there is one thing for certain, Steven Spielberg created a masterpiece with Schindler's List. It is a film that will find no equal in terms of bleak, crushing drama. It sets out what it intends to do marvelously and leaves the viewer emotionally drained and questioning humanity itself.The film is in black and white, a very conscious choice by the director that makes the subject matter, already disturbing, even more so bleak and harrowing. Oskar Schindler is known for saving thousands of Jews destined for a grim fate during World War 2. The movie depicts concentration camp life is fairly dismal, with constant brutal oppression by Nazi camp guards and the sadistic Amon Goth, with a terrifying portrayal by Ralph Fiennes.Yes, this film will not make you cheery or happy. Yes it is about a miserable and dark period in human history, but it is an important film to watch for anyone interested in this historic subject matter and also a beautiful work of art for film lovers. Truly one of Spielberg's finest works. The fact that he is Jewish himself does add a personal touch to the tragic tale, but he never tries to overdo the sympathy or antipathy towards any group in the film.Everyone is human in this film, the Jews and the Nazis; the tragedy is that humanity itself failed during this period of history, and we will never forget."
nscoby93,"Jan 5, 2025",10/10,"I don't know how I've been alive for 31 years and have never seen this film, but I refused to rush myself into watching it, and I'm sure glad I waited.Few films are so impactful, moving, and provoking they transcend filmmaking and become something else entirely. Well, suffice it to say Schindler's List is one of those films.I know there's nothing I can say that hasn't already been said about this film so I'll keep this brief.The writing is impeccable, the storytelling is fantastic, the characters are amazingly fleshed out, and John Williams's score is beautiful yet tragic.The entire cast puts in phenomenal performances especially Liam Neeson in the titular role as Oskar Schindler in what I believe is the performance of a lifetime. I have seen many of Liam Neeson's films but I genuinely believe this is one of his best roles. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also put in fantastic performances.But what stood out the most for me in this beautiful, tragic depiction of human history are the scenes with the extended absence of any musical score. It allowed these scenes of story and dialogue to carry much more weight. Only having the sound of the environments and the actor's dialogue to carry these moments was a work of genius.Finally, what surprisingly won me over was Spielberg's choice to shoot this film in black and white. More often than not I care very little for black and white motion pictures as it is used as style rather than be used in any meaningful way. Well, after this viewing, I firmly believe the storytelling was enriched by this choice, and I think it had a profound impact on the overall film.There's much more I could say and praise this film for, but I don't want to make this an unnecessarily long review. However, in closing, I will say I wish for the central cast of German characters the actors had more German accents or perhaps better German accents. Not to say this ruined anything because this is nothing more than a nitpick and doesn't affect my score but just something I would have liked to have heard for the sake of authenticity.Regardless this was a masterclass film and one that should live on as a historic piece of cinema history.Final Score: 10/10."
FilmSnobby,"Mar 2, 2004",3/10,"I mean, has enough time passed?  Or has the release of  *Schindler's List* on DVD fueled a new hushed awe towards the picture?Spielberg's critic-proof Holocaust film has several problems, the biggest of which is the way it turns a horrible real-life tragedy into a three-hanky melodrama.  I continue to maintain that the Holocaust is generally unfilmable, in terms of what we might call a standard movie.  Generally unfilmable, but not inevitably unfilmable.  Off the top of my head, I can recommend two recent films on this subject:  Francesco Rosi's  *The Truce*, and Costa-Gavras'  *Amen"".  Both films approach this material with far more nuance than Spielberg's film, which, I repeat, is weepy melodrama.  (And as such, treads a fine line between reverence and tastelessness.)  For that matter, Polanski's  *The Pianist*  gives us a more unique approach than what we get here, which is a movie that features a hero whom your average American multiplex popcorn-tub-muncher can easily identify with:  a gregarious capitalist named Oskar Schindler  (Liam Neeson)  who, despite all the war-profiteering  (read:  ""initiative""), turns out to have a heart of gold.  Or marshmallow mush.  Please don't bother pointing out that this is a ""true story"":  those who've read the actual book by Thomas Kenneally on which the movie is based will be rather shocked by the movie's willingness to sacrifice verisimilitude for  ""dramatic license"".  The biggest example of this is the  ""villain""  of the piece, SS-Kommandant Amon Goeth  (Ralph Fiennes in a career-making performance).  The screenplay ladles all sorts of Freudian syrup over this character, meaning:  he's crazy as a loon.  So much for the  ""banality of evil"":  instead, we get, via Fiennes'  Method-y performance, a study in mere neurosis instead of a rigorous examination of the murderous pathology that's inherent in humanity.  Spielberg can't resist having Herr Goeth develop a crush on one of his Jewish housemaids, and we get the requisite  ""Hath not a Jew eyes""  speech, delivered with what is supposed to be irony by Fiennes.  Then he beats the crap out of her. Change the plot particulars, and you've got your standard  ""Lifetime Channel"" movie about an abusive husband.Don't get me wrong, the film is not a total waste of time:  even melodrama has cumulative virtues, and many of the scenes in  *Schindler's List*  are quite affecting, particularly the very last sequence in which the surviving ""Schindler Jews""  appear  (in color), accompanied by the actors who portrayed them.  They pay tribute to Schindler by laying stones on his grave.  Moving stuff.  Ben Kingsley, who portrays the worry-wart Itzhak Stern, must also receive special mention.  And Spielberg's technical mastery is never open to question:  this is one beautifully mounted film, impeccably photographed.  The set-design, which is called upon to perform the daunting task of replicating Nazi labor camps and so forth, is beyond reproach. Proving that he's still the same guy who directed  *Jaws*, Spielberg is able to send chills up our spines when a train full of Jewish women & girls is accidentally routed to Auschwitz:  it's a night-scene, replete with a light-tower that approximates a beacon from Hell.But, all-in-all, the movie remains an elementary approach to the Holocaust genre.  It's tailor-made for desultory viewings by 12th-graders:  ""Hey mom, we learned about the Holocaust in class today.""  Nothing wrong with that, but aren't the kids better served by a FACTUAL documentary about this subject, rather than an Oscar-baited exercise in self-importance?  You decide."
giraffelover,"Sep 29, 1998",N/A,"I've seen this film one time in 1994. This is one of the best movies ever made, but many scenes of the film are so brutal, that I'm afraid to see this film for a second time."
Hitchcoc,"Mar 28, 2006",10/10,"We need to look at a work of art like this to see ourselves in this movie. This is the result of a regime that no longer saw the worth of the human being. It politicize life. This leads to monstrous treatment of people (because they are not people in their eyes). I saw this film the first week it came out. We were on vacation on Hilton Head Island in South Carolina. I remember my wife and I not being able to talk for almost 15 minutes after it was over and then we needed to talk about something else. There are few experiences that can do that to someone. Since that time, I've had many others tell me the same thing. Why is this movie so much more effective than other Holocaust films. First of all, there's something personal about it. We get to know the people, even the bad guys. Secondly, the recreation of the death camps is so accurate. Then there is a spot of genius, the little girl in the red coat. If anyone wants to complain about black and white, watch this film. We get to see what can be done with shades and shadows. The work of Schindler is the work of the heart against great odds. The scene at the end when the holocaust survivors visit the graveyard, is what moves the film. I think that everyone should see this film at some time. Then sit down and think about what is being done to people here in our own country."
criticalthinker4,"Aug 16, 2017",10/10,This is my all time favorite Spielberg film. Its truthful and reliable in its information and the encounter's at which takes place. I love the dedication to research and the intricate details in the film and how it was put together. This film will make anyone appreciate that which we all take for granted everyday... LIFE
p-41705-32770,"Dec 29, 2024",10/10,"This movie should be included in any school lessons from the 5th grade (16yrs) on.I saw it in the theatre in 1993 and I honestly never saw a movie theatre so silent at the end of the movie. Normally people stand up, chatting or go for a drink in the lobby but none of them did so.The ice cold chilling silence reflected how people were affected by this very real made movie....This is a true masterpiece in the category of top notch cinematography !Even the music is from another level !We may never forget what happened in wwI and wwII and even then we still haven't learned a thing about peace today."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 4, 2009",10/10,"Some of Schindler's List is very disturbing indeed, with very graphic images on the screen. I thought this film is outstanding. True, it is very long, but the Holocaust was a very long and epic event, and the movie needed a long length to convey the harsh realities of the Nazi's treatment of the Jews. The cinematography was truly excellent, and some of the close ups of people being tortured or dying was enough to make you look away. The direction was taut and focused, most Spielburg's movies are good, but don't quite always have an impact on the whole audience. Schindler's List is visually disturbing and incredibly moving, and because of this, this is definitely Spielburg's best. The acting was phenomenal. Both Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley give superb performances, and Ralph Fiennes is also very chilling in his role. The music by John Williams is not only haunting, but also unbearably sad, believe me I was in tears for a lot of this movie. All in all, a truly moving film, that deserves a 10/10. Bethany Cox."
onlyumangsri,"Jan 16, 2018",10/10,"A movie which is so beautifully portrayed and is so hopeful that it won't let you take your eyes off it. 
The black and white portrayal is just exquisite and beyond words. I had a pleasure watching it and people out there must watch it there as well. This is literally one of the best artwork of cinema and the crown for Mr. Spielberg. The direction and screenplay is just astounding and for me this really is the most astonishing work of Mr. Fiennes. 
It was a great cinematic experience."
Krissz67,"Aug 15, 2017",10/10,"I think it is very authentic film, about the Holocaust. Excessively good acting games, good directing, and very nice imagery. The story is very heart clamp, mostly because the film based on true story. I think This film is a good and beautiful memory thousands of deceased Jewish, Hungarian, etc... and other nationalities of people. We hope this will not happen again in real life."
lhhung_himself,"Feb 11, 2002",1/10,"Schindler's list is not a bad film per se - Liam Neeson is very good as Schindler and if you edit out some of the more overblown scenes - the story is still riveting. Yet it could have been so much more if the story just told simply and if the central theme were fully understood and developed.Before the war Schindler and his friend, Goeth were boozy, flirtatious German businessmen. Both would have likely been uninspired failures had there been no war. In a kinder world, Goeth's and Schindler's moral differences might have manifested themselves in the size of the tip that they would leave the barmaid. In war, the consequences of moral choices are greatly magnified, resulting in Schindler becoming a most unlikely heroic figure, and Goeth becoming a loathed prison commandant. In the film, Spielberg elevates Schindler to sainthood status and portrays Goeth as a sadistic psychopath. By sanitizing Schindler's many faults (boozing, gambling, womanizing...) and by demonizing Goeth, Spielberg severs our connection with them and, ironically, blunts the conflict between them. Adolf Eichmann was far more chilling than Charles Manson. Unlike Manson, whom we could dismiss as psychotic, Eichmann was the faceless functionary that we have all experienced, whose defense of ""following orders"" is one that we have all heard, a defense that was used by many during the war, and one that we might see ourselves using under similar circumstances had we not Schindler's courage. By making Schindler a saint, Spielberg diminishes both his accomplishment and his inspiration to us - saints have no problems making the right decision - the rest of us do. Rather than a gaping chasm, there is but a fine moral line between Schindler and Goeth - one that we tread every day, which fortunately for us, rarely does more than determines a barmaid's salary.Spielberg does not develop this simple theme, preferring to impress us with a grandiose view of a great moral tale. Instead, he comes off as the underskilled sous-chef drowning a wonderful filet mignon in an overly rich sauce. The quality of the ingredients still shine through despite the clumsy handling but does not approach its great potential. In the end, the best thing about the film is that it reminds Americans of a monstrous event in history. It is unfortunate that this reminder is necessary and that it reduces such a timeless parable to a useful public service announcement."
s-tb,"Nov 20, 2011",N/A,"This movie, Schindler's List, is hands-down without a doubt one of the greatest films I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. Regardless of how much praise I include in my review, I should still think it deserves more. Few movies are actually able to pull tears out of my stubborn eyes, and the two that come right to mind are this one, and It's a Wonderful Life. Schindler's List is a grim portrayal of events in the Holocaust, while at the same time actually bringing light to some of the humanity still there. I was embarrassed when I actually started clapping in that classroom where I first watched this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody and it remains in my top selection of movies. Outstanding."

Julius_Lang,"Jan 17, 2025",10/10,"Schindler's List is possibly the greatest film I have ever seen. I wish it wasn't as perfect as it is since the heavy emotional toll is devastating. I've only cried once at a film but I didn't feel devastated. This is far and away the most devastating and horrifying film I have laid my eyes upon.The meaningful cinematography using only black, white and red is stunning. Spielberg himself stated that it represents how the Holocaust was. Life without light.The acting is amazing. No question. And the score is perfect. However, I must warn that the pacing can get pretty choppy.Go watch it instead of reading this review. I cannot say enough good things about it."
Tviktor212,"Sep 24, 2017",9/10,"The first time I've seen it, Schindler's list didn't give me much of an impression. It was horrific, black and white, and I was 15. Now, after I got myself quite a cinematographic culture, feeling the urge to identify Spieblerg's masterpiece, I came back to this movie. I knew it was rated as one of the best films generally, ever, but when I took a look at the reviews, I became really worried. Most of the 1/10 ratings bring reasonless motivations for this film's criticism.The main points of criticism that I saw are the following: 1) it manipulates facts; 2) presents a too distinct line between good jews and evil Nazis; 3) too emotional; 4) money grab; 5) ""Holocaust is bad, we already knew it"" (and this is an almost exact quote);1) the claims for this point of criticism are that it portrays a positive figure of Oskar Schindler, exaggerates several aspects of the holocaust, and portrays essentially bad Nazis (we to this latter point in 2)); Let's get this straight: unlike some reviewers claim, Oskar Schindler didn't end up as an enriched Industrialist, as some reviewers wrongly claim. In other words, he didn't earn off the holocaust anything. On the contrary, he spent his entire fortune on bribes and corruption acts in order to aid his Jewish workers. He even had to escape to Argentina, as many Nazi officers did after WWII. As for the claims of overly dramatisation, that is certainly an aspect of the film. There are a few scenes which are not accurate (e.g. the shower scene - in real life, jews didn't fear the gas chamber as they where purposely misinformed). Generally, though, I didn't see that much of an overly dramatization. Most of the times, the film presented simply factual events. Jews were in fact killed and persecuted, there's nothing overly dramatized. Concentration camps where truly such bloody places as seen in the film. Instead, maybe it even downgraded violence quite a lot., still being incredibly bloody as a film.2) Good jews vs. bad Nazis; I remember Hans Landa's monologue from the beginning of Inglorious Basterds, which centered on jews being rats in the sense that they're generally a population that could figure out a solution easily. Do not get me wrong here (obviously Landa stereotypes this immensely), but this is portrayed often, mainly in the first portion of the film. Jews going to the Synagogue to buy and sell instead of praying, some jews that join the police force and essentially collaborate with the Nazis, and some jews fight each other when hiding away during the ghetto persecution scene. I clearly would not say that all jews are good nor that all German soldiers are bad, but that shouldn't be a matter to be portrayed in a holocaust film. To see an avid jew, go watch ""A Christmas Carol"". As for ""bad Nazis"", I'd like to clear out again what is Nazional-Socialism. It was an extremist, right-wing movement that enhanced, in this case, Germany's national identity and superiority on the base of racial distinction, and urged violence on anyone that would not be member of the ""superior"" race. This movement, along with fascism, attracted a great deal of fanatics. I'd like to suggest the view of ""Novecento"", which similarly depicts the rise of fascism in Italy and its ruthless cruelty, carried on by it he insane and violent individuals which joined the party in the early twenties. I know that one movie depicted a Nazi soldier's moral division during WWII, called ""Onore e Lealtà"", which has low reviews for the same reason that prevents this film from portraying ""good"" Nazis: it is kind of dangerous, and can easily turn in a glorification of Nazis. Nonetheless, most of the cruelty is carried through a notorious war criminal, Amon Goeth.3) Spielberg is of Jewish origins. As a filmmaker, he's considered this story very personal. Moreover, he is notorious for being emotional in his serious films.4) It is well known that Spielberg chose to renounce for his fee as he considered it ""blood money"". Of course studios have to do a profit of their movies, but film is still a form of art. Movie makers of Spielberg's caliber do films without a simple capitalistic view of making money, but with the purpose of making an art work. Schindler's list is not a fancy action blockbuster, if nothing else, its black and white colouring identifies it as an art film. Add the fact the Spielberg felt personal about this story, and you'll realise how empty this claim is.5) This film was released in 1993; I personally don't know many outstanding holocaust films from before 1993 (certainly a lot from after 1993), or if there were, they certainly weren't as bold as this one. A black and white film about a crude subject that keeps the viewer's attention for 3 hours and 15 minutes. Think about it. I personally believe that, unlike other films (this includes my favourite holocaust film, Son of Saul), gives a such wide view on the holocaust. This film shows most of the aspects of the holocaust, some overrdramatised, but nonetheless represented. It is really stupid to see this movie as unnecessary.Conclusively, I'd like to point out that 6 million jews died due to the Holocaust. The only bigger genocide I know of is that of the native Americans, 18 million only in northen America. Seeing so many 1/10 reviews that base their claims on this being basically Jewish propaganda is worrying, especially considering the rise of right-wing ideologies that happened in the latter years. Are we forgetting history? I hope not. And, in case that's the truth, it's films like Schindler's list that remind us of that."
dudybenet,"Oct 3, 2017",10/10,this movie deserve 10/10 rating. it shows us what exactly happened during ww2 without shocking too much. this fact opens the movie to a bigger crowd who can watch and even learn about the suffer of the Jewish people in east Europe. this movie also teaches us about choices and not to include the individual according to characteristics such as social group and political views.
framptonhollis,"Sep 20, 2015",7/10,"Steven Spielberg is one of the greatest filmmakers of all time.He has directed family films (""E.T.""), horror films (""Jaws""), science fiction movies (""Close Encounters of the Third Kind""), and even quite a few mature, adult dramas. ""Schindler's List"" is one of the mature, adult dramas.It is a 3 hour long epic of a film, shot in beautiful black and white. The black and white photography works perfectly with the emotional John Williams score and tough subject matter. For some reason, the images of snowy areas were really beautiful to me, and I can't explain exactly why this minor element added so much to the film for me.Spielberg explicitly shows the brutality of the Nazis, and how awful the Holocaust truly was. In this film, the shaky cam actually works to the film's advantage! It isn't over the top or distracting in any way, and makes the film feel like a kind of gritty documentary at times. It actually adds to the film, rather than ruining it!This film is just a masterpiece on every single level. There is great acting, music, cinematography, and so on...I know why the film is so universally loved. While still being brutal, ""Schindler's List"" is a very touching and powerful piece of cinema about a truly great man. I'd highly recommend the film to anybody who can handle the film's tough subject matter."
Nerdboy1423,"May 29, 2006",1/10,"This is just another film like Amistad that Steven Spielberg thought might be important to put to film. But, after seeing a film like United 93, I feel that, going back to this film, I see it as exploitation. That it is exploiting the pain of the entire holocaust and the tragedy that it really was, and exploiting that for emotional reasons but worse, to give Oskar Shindler an opposite, and something to purify him from a narrative character perspective. It's not that I hate the film, it's well made in every aspect, but it is basically a Frank Capra picture set within a really huge tragedy. One character is not the hero or villain here, there is no black and white. Since it chooses to display the Holocaust so graphically, do it in a better way. But watching the film and contrasting it to what actually did happen, I have to wonder, is there a really truthful way of representing the Holocaust? It's such a monstrous tragedy, the big abomination of the 20th century, should it really be put onto film, and are the words now used to describe it, ""Never Again"", really a truthful representation? Is this how we want people to remember the Holocaust? Through a film that presents a hero struggling to be a capitalist and struggling to be a good man by Western standards by saving as many people as possible. If he had saved ""one more"" person, it wouldn't have mattered. The film is permanent, and the Holocaust itself is as well. I firmly believe this is not the appropriate way to depict something that actually happened and was so important. It's the singular voice of the director here, this film might as well by ""It's A Wonderful Life"", because that is essentially what it is. The same story, the same character arc for Shindler. It's just not appropriate and I think that the time has not come yet for us to truly be able to grasp the atrocity of the Holocaust. I believe the means of representation are not available for us or at our disposal."
Goldwaterproductions,"Jun 5, 2012",N/A,"Perfect.Perfect on every level from the acting to the script, to the cinematography, everything about this movie is 100% perfect.I've watched this movie 3 times and there's nothing I would change. Even the insanely long running time of 3 hours and 15 minutes isn't a bad thing. Every scene feels important. I would highly recommend watching this movie. Although it is very violent and very heartbreaking so be warned!! But if you can handle strong violence and a difficult subject matter such as the Holocaust, then you must see it. It's my favorite movie, and I hope it will one day become yours too.Rating: 10/10"
anastazianichole,"Jun 3, 2016",10/10,"My first recollection of this movie was in my early adolescence, and of all the movies I've seen that portray historical events, Schindler's list is one that evokes the greatest emotion and most memorable impression. The black and white representation provokes the feeling of desolation, and shows the seriousness of the events that took place during that era, but doesn't overshadow the brilliance of Schindler's unrelenting kindness and heroism despite all obstacles. It gives descriptive recounts of how heinously and inhumane Jews were treated, with raw and unforgiving scenes unlike those seen in most factual films. This is truly one of Spielberg's best works of art."
eleanor-97684,"May 26, 2017",9/10,"This is an amazing film in every detail. The acting is emotional powerful and extremely convincing. I believe the choice to keep the film in black and white was a great decision, as it means you are focused on the story-telling and acting rather than colours (also when on rare occasions colour does appear, it really makes those moments stand out at the time, and memorable later). The black and white almost removes the 'life' from the film, which I found to be important in the storytelling. The music by John Williams is absolutely stunning, and Itzhak Perlman's violin solo of the main theme is so moving (especially when considering the meaning behind this story and his partly Jewish roots). I am always pleased when filmmakers attempt important and moving topics that the films come out well, and Spielberg did an exceptional job on this film in all regards (from the casting, to the cinematography, to the music). I will never not cry or be moved by this film."
mrbinayadhikari,"Dec 21, 2024",10/10,"Schindler's List is one of the most powerful films I've ever seen. It's not just a movie; it's an experience that leaves you shaken to the core. Steven Spielberg captures the horrors of the Holocaust with unflinching honesty, making it hard to watch at times but impossible to look away. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is remarkable-his transformation from a profit-driven businessman to a savior of lives feels so real and human. Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth is terrifying, a haunting reminder of the cruelty people are capable of. The black-and-white cinematography and the haunting violin score stay with you long after. This is a film everyone should see at least once. It's heartbreaking but necessary."
plg-78756,"Oct 21, 2017",10/10,"Many have tried and done very god jobs too (Zookeeper's wife, Life Is Beautiful, Once Upon A Time In America, Fiddler On The roof) but Schindler's List is the undisputed masterpiece of humanity.Whoever directed this is a genius. I suggest you watch it and then watch it again and get copies into your friends hands. It shows the evil done upon God's Chosen people and asks for penance. Sad beyond words."
nurchowdhuryhimel,"Oct 12, 2017",10/10,"I liked it very much. Very heart touching story, awesome cinematography, everyone's acting were very good. Liam Neeson was just awesome.I really appreciate the effort of Oscar Schindler. The German army's cruelty was properly pictured in the movie.My rating 10 out of 10."
larsenib,"Mar 16, 2016",8/10,"At the beginning of this movie it was unclear to me whether Oskar Schindler was a good person or a bad person. Since he was German, my first instinct was that he was the enemy. However, as the plot progressed it was clear that he in fact was one of the good guys. He had an accountant who was Jewish but Oskar treated him like he was a human rather than a disposable creature. He also creates a list of Jews he wants to work for him and provides them with a safe work environment. He insists that he Rabbi carry out religious practices and take part in the sabbath. Schindler is unlike the other Germans portrayed in this movie, he is kind, accepting and overall a good person."
buzoncontacto,"Jul 27, 2007",7/10,"It is quite an intriguing thing how people react to this movie, judging by IMDb comments: either they label it ""masterpiece"" or ""a sappy, manipulative banalization of the Holocaust"". Either 1 or 10 score. I can't understand it. To me, Schindler's List has both merits and flaws. It is a technically perfect film, for example. I think no director can beat Spielberg on that. He is able to film such an overwhelming, astonishing scene as the Warsaw Ghetto raid and simply...well, simply make you buy it. He can offer you a conventional scene, like that Jewish fugitive trying to deceive his Nazi chasers, and provide you a glimpse of his terror so intense that you can even feel it. No other director that I am aware of is able to take advantage of modern technology in a way even remotely close to Spielberg. No one else has the power to offer us wonders, to leave you speechless, to make the unbelievable believable. He did it in Schindler's List, then in Prince of Egypt, then in Private Ryan (perhaps the most amazing visual experience in my life). Even Munich shrinks your guts in the shooting scenes.Unfortunately for Spielberg, though, there is more in movies than technical ability. The man has a knack for sappiness, for easy morals. Now come on, a movie about the Holocaust, focusing on the Jews? Yet one more mouthful of the same porridge that we have been spoon-fed for decades? And then ""La Amistad"", a film intended to teach that slavery is wrong? Private Ryan, which focuses on how heroic American soldiers were during WWII, support our troops and honor the vets? Not exactly controversial matters, I am afraid. To make things worse, Spielberg doesn't make the least attempt to blur the simplistic premise. His Germans are devils, his victims (Jews, black slaves) are pure, noble and innocent all along and without exception. And critics are right: he is too sentimental, too sappy. It grows just awkward, in some extreme cases (I have in mind a couple scenes from Private Ryan, right now).And then there is the annoying (to me, at least) political undertones of his films. In Schindler's list, for example, the final scene is very revealing. The Jews escape the factory and meet a Soviet soldier. ""What can we do"" ""If I were you, I wouldn't go East. They don't like you there. Neither I would go west"". Next scene: we see all the survivors in modern Israel. Get it? Israel is the shelter of Jews against the intolerance of...well, of everyone else, East and West alike. It would be enough to show that some Jews became traitors and betrayed his ilk, it would suffice to show that many interns (millions) in the camps were not Jews, it would make the film much more complex and deeper if we were offered some hint that, well, camps were run in a good measure by the interns themselves, the Kapos, who could be as ruthless as the SS. In fact, we are not even allowed to understand that the 30s and 40s were a time of strong political commitment and that many of those Jews were Socialists or Communists, and that they often created support nets inside the very camps. Does Mr. Spielberg fear we would fail to sympathized with the victims if we understood that they were three-dimensional human beings? Does he really regard his viewers THAT dumb?"
paladeen,"Aug 2, 2008",5/10,"Schindler's List is one of the most overrated films of all time: It won seven Oscars. It is the 6th highest rated film on IMDb. The critics loved it, and the Internet is flooded with reviews where people rave about being ""deeply moved"" or ""touched.""Ultimately, the film is a shallow failure.A good drama film needs several qualities. Of these, the most important is the exposition of characters and their interactions. Schindler's List flops spectacularly in this respect. We start out following the tale of Oskar Schindler, an opportunistic, profiteering businessman. But midpoint in the film, this Schindler persona has disappeared, and we have a new character clothed in the same flesh -- a self-sacrificing philanthropist who spends his entire amassed fortune to save the Jew workers. How did we get from one to the other? How did Schindler transform from the evil Mr. Hyde to the benevolent Dr. Jekyll? Steven Spielberg certainly doesn't show us -- maybe it happens via magic, like the bicycle ride in ET?And what about Amon Göth, the representative Nazi? A ""grotesque caricature"" if there ever was one. He's an evil, sadistic, Jew-hating Nazi bastard -- but do we get to know why he wakes up every morning, takes a swig of booze and snipes Jew prisoners for fun? No. Spielberg thinks the answer is obvious -- he's a Nazi, and Nazis don't have reasons for the things they do. They're just rabid dogs out for blood, utterly devoid of any moral dimension. But this sort of shallow political correctness can't possibly cut any slack with intelligent viewers. We want to know why Göth hates the Jews so much that he fires his pistol into a pile of decimated corpses, but we never get to know. Apparently, he does it because he's an Evil Nazi, and that's all there is to it.The attempt to add depth to Göth's character by dwelling on his twisted love affair with a Jewish girl is easily seen for what it is -- a cheap exposure of Nazi hypocrisy. How about trying to dwell on real issues here, Spielberg? How about trying to pass these people off as genuine (albeit twisted) human beings?This shortcoming is not restricted to Spielberg. When will Hollywood own up to the fact that the men who ran the Third Reich were not mindless monsters? Some of them were cultivated intellectuals and scientists, others compassionate family men and devoted friends. Germany was the best educated country in Europe when the Nazis rose to power. The true intrigue of the Holocaust does not lie in the brutality, but rather in Hannah Arendt's ""banality of evil"". How can a man (or millions of men) arbitrarily narrow the moral sphere to exclude people seemingly no different from neighbours, friends and family? How can a man fall under the sway of a dispassionate and cruel ideology while leading a normal life of compassion?Needless to say, none of these issues are explored by Spielberg.Another peeve of mine: Accents. There are English-speaking films and then there are German-speaking films. Schindler's List, on the other hand, does not belong to either of these categories. Instead, Spielberg opted to have the characters speak English with a German accent. What the hell? Listening to Liam Neeson strut about trying to sound like an Anglicised German is just pathetic. : Spielberg's trying to please Hollywood audiences by making the film accessible to them (and hence, no spoken German), but for the love of God! We get the point! They're in Nazi Germany. Yes, Hitler's in charge. Yes, it's a nasty, genocidal regime. Please, no cheesy accents.One of the truly unforgivable aspects of the film is the ending. A mildly touching speech by Schindler about being a war criminal on the run, wanted by the victors of the war, set just the right mood. It would have been perfect. But no, Spielberg couldn't resist messing it up -- he had to have Schindler break down, bawl and cry, grief-stricken and lashed by pangs of conscience. Spare me the anguish, Spielberg. The grief should have been that of the Jews, not Schindler.When Schindler took off his gold ring and blubbers out ""I could have saved one more"", I experienced a feeling of mild revulsion. Look, the guy did a great job, he saved a lot of lives. No point in getting all worked up about the fact that he didn't literally sell the skin of his back to save people he didn't know.What does this film leave us after 195 minutes of running time? Let's see:* The Nazis were *Really Evil* * There was a man called Schindler who didn't care about anything but money at first, and then for some reason he started to care about saving the Jews.Brilliant, Spielberg. Positively brilliant.All of the above-mentioned flaws are bad enough -- but the way the film manipulates the viewer really takes the cake. Shots of emaciated, shaved potential Holocaust victims starving and screaming, with tragic violin music to boot. It has been done in many films before, and will be done again. It doesn't take skill for a film-maker to coerce the viewer into sorrow -- It takes skill to produce the same feelings without resorting to cheap, melodramatic trickery. The Pianist is a superb counter-example. A journey of the mind is so much more satisfying than a journey of the senses...Like most of Spielberg's films, Schindler's List is technically outstanding. It captures the mood of wartime Germany perfectly. The sets, costumes and cinematography are all top-notch, and the acting is not too bad either. However, none of these things can overcome the fact that Spielberg is a director of extremely limited vision. His moral and intellectual depth is that of a child.Stick to making films for children, Spielberg. Stick to making children's films. You're out of your depth."
Docterry,"Mar 31, 1999",N/A,"I don't know why but a couple of days ago I pulled out my copy of Schindler's List.  At first I thought, well, maybe I'll watch a few minutes of it- it's so depressing but I feel like watching a good movie for a change.  I hadn't seen this picture in several years since it was released. The first time I saw the film, in the theater, I went with my parents and was somewhat in denial.  I tried to block out the pain that was before me and retain my composure.  After realizing its brilliance, I tried to forget the film.  It certainly wasn't something to dwell on.This time when I watched the film I really surprised myself.  I sat and cried like I haven't in years- but that's a good thing.  I've been so divorced from my feelings and so wrapped up in my own selfish hell that I forgot what life is capable of becoming.Now, Spielberg himself has admitted that he tends to over-sentimentalize things.  Take the scene when Stern has just been rescued from the train by Schindler and as the two men walk away the camera pans to a large room where the suitcases of  countless other souls less fortunate are being trifled through; a  pile of personal photographs of  family lay strewn amidst wasted boots and eye glasses.  That scene destroyed me with emotion yet it was something that actually happened.I will admit that towards the end, when Schindler was going on about how he could have sold his car to save more lives or sold his pin- even on second inspection, that scene seems rather forced- even enough for Jerry Seinfeld to mock.  I was kind of mad at Spielberg.  I mean, doesn't he know when to back off.  It seems with an absolute masterpiece like this film, he would have been more careful and edited out this truly ""sentimental"" passage with violins going haywire.Regardless, I'm in awe of this picture and with his latest- Saving Private Ryan, I do think that Spielberg is truly one of, if not, the greatest directors of film ever."
Mittenstigger61,"Mar 1, 2016",10/10,"Schindler's List,in my opinion, was a very accurate portrayal of the man and war themselves. I enjoyed the cast and was very gripped in the story right from the beginning thru to the very end,and that doesn't happen very often. World War II was very complex, to begin with, and when Oscar Schindler assisted with placing Jewish People in jobs, in order to keep them out of the Concentration Camps, that was the nicest thing anyone had done for them in a long time. The people he placed appreciated it,and he was a good employer as well.His friends didn't realize he was doing this,and I don't think they would have themselves. When the Nazis came and took some of the people who worked for him, he tried everything to keep them out of the camps."
nwestwood-697-780556,"May 28, 2013",10/10,"The feelings I experienced while viewing this film are almost indescribable. I am an avid fan in World War II history but more specifically Holocaust history. It is my belief that humanity has a huge lesson to be learned from cowardly acts such as the Holocaust, and this movie has an uncanny way of helping pass the message along. This film shows human compassion even in the darkest of times. I do not think my eyes were dry at all during the movie-I found it so deeply moving. My rating of 10/10 originates from both the acting as well as the message gained. The movie will have a place not only on my shelf but also in my heart."
nadrojh,"Jul 22, 2017",10/10,"Schindler's List is a great drama about the holocaust. It is both well written and directed. I haven't read the book or done much research. However it does tell a touching story of a man trying to save life in a very dark time in history. Steven Spielberg did an incredible job directing. There was so much detail in each scene. I liked the use of black and white it gave this sad tragic story a dark and gloomy tone. It also has a wonderful ending. It has a large wonderful cast with incredible performances by Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, and Ralph Fiennes. I was surprised by the amount of negative user reviews I seen. Schindler's List is a great drama about a tragic time in history. It isn't a movie you can watch over and over, but it is a movie that should be seen. It ties with Saving Private Ryan as Steven Spielberg's best work. It is also one of the best movies from 1990's. It is a great movie."

poewilson,"Oct 4, 2017",9/10,"The P.H. Metric 91/100 Directing: 9/10A masterclass in direction. Spielberg's connection to the source material pushed him to make something that defies any sort of dilettante criticisms. Every decision from the black and white to the stones hits hard and hits well. Leaving the viewer with a piece that is entertaining, yet horrifically beautiful as well as being the sort of thing any student of cinema should be studying.Acting: 9/10Liam Neeson's best role, before he revealed to the world that method acting is not something he subscribes to, which in turn means Liam Neeson plays Liam Neeson every time. The rest of the cast offers more nuanced performances that really provide the viewer with a subdued approach to such horrors, allowing the audience to feel disconnected from the tragedy, yet thrust into its dark world.Cinematography: 10/10Red, red, red. Visually perfect.Editing 10/10Editing makes a film, it cannot be said enough. Actors and the like get the credit, but editors along with the writers and directors are the heart, spine and brain of a film and this film only furthers to reinforce the fact that actors are far from needed to meld a film into something sublime.Score: 10/10Williams provides another stellar score, which raises the question would Spielberg's films be as successful with out them? That said, Williams builds tension that spills morosely over tragedy and celebratory fatigue.Visual Effects: 8/10The shower scene aside, the visual effects are done well and kept in the century they are meant to be in and keeps the viewer planted firmly in the time period.Writing: 8/10The writing is superb, however it does have one to many touches of the Hollywood penmanship to it, which does cause the film to drift into a territory that feels a little unnatural for the artistic intentions of the piece.Production Design 9/10Superb production design, save for a few touches in the concentration camps.Costume Design 9/10Authentic and eye catching, though does fall victim to the standard nerd mistakes.Make-up/Hairstyle 9/10Several hairstyles feel off for the period and the make-up department does benefit greatly from the black and white."
alex-306,"Sep 19, 1999",6/10,"It's not that Schindler's List is a bad movie; in parts, it's quite powerful.  What has always annoyed me about this film, however, was the way it was so unreservedly embraced by critics and unsophisticated moviegoers. Seriously, am I the only one who was unimpressed by the main ethical point of the movie? Really, what does this film have to say beyond, ""the Holocaust was a bad thing?""  I'm sorry if I don't consider this to be groundbreaking, cutting-edge historical analysis.  Furthermore, am I the only one who was offended that Spielberg made a fundamentally ""feel good"" movie about the holocaust?  Was I the only one that was offended by the fact the film ends by dedicating itself to the six million Jews who died in the Holocaust (and about the five million non-Jews who also died you say nothing)?  Did anyone else notice how the main characters in Schindler's List were not actually Jewish, thereby following in the grand Hollywood tradition of turning the story of oppressed people into the story of a sympathetic member of the oppressing group (a la Cry Freedom, Mississippi Burning, Beyond Rangoon, and so on)?  What really offended me, however, was an issue that, in all fairness, was peripheral to the film itself.  I was infuriated by the way Hollywood patted itself on the back for making a movie it hadn't wanted to make, a movie it should have made decades before.  Schindler's List was made about forty years too late, and at its core is the same innocuous Hollywood nonsense that has pervaded the world of cinema for far too long.  The memory of the members of my family who were murdered during this tragedy deserved better."
dawidbleja,"Mar 7, 2002",1/10,"As possibly the world's most influential film-maker, Spielberg has a responsibility. And that responsibility entails NOT using his cheesy, shallow sensibilities to turn one of the most profoundly horrible parts of human history into a soap opera-style piece of fluff. This film is more than just a bad film, it is a downright dangerously bad film that will be watched by millions of impressionable people who might have had few other sources to base their knowledge of the Holocaust on. Most of us agree that the worst thing to do about something like the Holocaust is to forget it, lest it happen again. The next worst thing is to trivialise it to the point where it resembles so many other Hollywood pieces of trash.What possesses a man who has become rich and powerful in the film industry solely through the making of shallow, transparent films for children to think that he is talented and wise enough to present to the masses a subject which should only be touched by the most careful and socially responsible hands? A Mid-life crisis, and an over-inflated ego, most likely, not that it matters though.Only someone with many years of study may be a doctor; only an experienced engineer may build a bridge, and even the guy who fixes your toilet must be a qualified plumber. Yet this fool, whose only previous qualifications have been cheap, shallow, movies made strictly for entertainment, thinks he is in a rightful position to educate our children. Because, unfortunately, many people have a frighteningly limited amount of knowledge about the second world war, and Schindler's List will be for many of them their main source of information. Showing it to them in as cheesy and hollow a fashion as almost only Spielberg can, is simply a crime."

aurora7459,"Feb 20, 2016",10/10,"Perfection.There are films, admittedly few, that transcend themselves. In fact, they transcend even the art of filmmaking. Sometimes, these films are simply grand on a scale not before seen...films such as ""Titanic"" and ""LOTR"" may well qualify here...other times, these films achieve such utter perfection that they simply take on a life of their own...still other times, the films become a symbol of the times. These are the films that make the perfect statement at the perfect time in life. Finally, there are films such as ""Schindler's List."" Films such as these, perhaps the most rare of all, are films that touch the soul of all humanity with a universal truth that is so profound and so vividly presented that it becomes an icon unto itself. ""Schindler's List"" is, indeed, an icon of American cinema.Steven Spielberg's 1993 story of Oskar Schindler, a man whose greed, vanity and self-indulgence is somehow transformed during the Nazi Holocaust into a self-sacrificing, humanitarian existence saving the lives of 1100 Jews from the Auschwitz death camp, is a powerful, deeply insightful, brutally honest and constantly moving film that transcends itself by bringing to light with great clarity one of the most troubling times in global history.""Schindler's List"" is not necessarily a comfortable film to watch and I dare say the casual film-goer might not rate it highly. It is not, to the casual eye, an entertaining film. Only the film-goer who is well versed in cinema and dedicated to the mastery of filmmaking will most likely consider this film entertaining, though many others will still appreciate it.There are, quite simply, films that are not meant to entertain. They are not designed for our pleasure, but for much grander purposes. ""Schindler's List"" is a challenging film but a deeply healing one.Virtually every aspect of ""Schindler's List"" achieves perfection from performances to production quality to script to direction. It would be most challenging to find a film that achieves such balanced perfection.As Oskar Schindler, Liam Neeson presents a multi-faceted performance of great depth with a unique balance of self-indulgence and self- sacrifice, shallow materialism with generous offering. Neeson offers a Schindler who is confident yet often indecisive. What makes this performance remarkable is its pacing...So often, in these humanity films we get a ""superhero"" approach or a man who suddenly and immediately transforms into Mr. Wonderful. Schindler's transformation here is a quieter, more subtle transition that allows the audience to watch him change...watch him struggle with this change. It's a remarkable, controlled performance in what could have been a stereotypical ""tour de force.""While Neeson clearly takes the lead here, the supporting roles are simply outstanding including Ben Kingsley as accountant Itzhak Stern, a man who works with Schindler yet remains wary of him and the Nazi's. Ralph Fiennes offers, perhaps, the ""tour de force"" performance as Amon Goeth, a sadistic Nazi whose callous brutality is disturbing yet, in many ways, very complementary to Schindler.The list could go on and on in terms of exemplary performances...yet, it's so hard to single out individuals when truly every aspect of this film is perfect. The score of John Williams is magnificent, blending perfectly the desperation of the situation with the moments of great life and the moments of great rage...the cinematography of Janusz Kaminski utilizes perfectly the use of color (largely black and white) with tremendous shading and just the perfect mix of brutality and hopefulness.The film's attention to detail is astounding, including the music, costuming, language and production design.Yet, in many ways, watching ""Schindler's List"" makes me not want to comment on any of its production values. This film is so much more than its acting or its writing or its anything else...It is a film that transcends, truly, the art of filmmaking and becomes a story and a film and an experience for the entire world. Yes, it truly is that grand.""Schindler's List"" inspires, and yet, simultaneously horrifies. It is, in my opinion, Spielberg's finest work and one I doubt he will ever top. ""Schindler's List"" is more than a film...it is a life experience of such depth and beauty and greatness that I think it almost calls out for an 11th Commandment...Thou Shalt See ""Schindler's List."""
JamesBonato,"Mar 17, 2016",10/10,I was riveted from the opening scene to the closing credits where the live people from the Holistic were laying stones with Ben Kingsly. Don't plan on answering the phone or trying to squeeze dinner in while watching the movie. Nothing will be able to interrupt you. This was the first real taste I got of Liam Neeson. After that I made it a point to see some of his other films. A friend had told me about the filming of the shower scene and how hard it was to do it. I imagine the train scene was also very difficult as actors as well as all the crew behind the camera. I wish for this film to be shown in high schools because I never knew of this movement in WWII. At least there was some little glimmer of humanity in that war as this film shows.
justinwest-14208,"Jan 22, 2022",10/10,I don't think I need to explain why this is a ten. Every moment in this film is there for a reason. It's just a masterpiece. Liam Neeson does an amazing job as usual. This movie is one of the most moving pictures ever put on a screen. It should be required to watch in school.
Zauberlehrling,"Aug 3, 1998",10/10,"I think that this movie was a fingertip to the bad environment that happen here in Germany since 1989, when the wall broke down between east and west Germany.I wish more people would understand the meaning of this film."
alex_der_bert,"Sep 14, 2015",7/10,"Hello IMDb One of the most moving and captivating films I have ever seen, I would recommend it to anyone! It shows us a side to World War two and the holocaust that is completely unique, due to the fact that it is based upon a true story. The film grasps your attention from start to finish, despite being in black and white and it being a lengthy film. Liam Neeson once again shows us how good he really is, portraying the character of Mr Schindler. The movie is centered around the life of Oskar Schindler, he is a German businessman, who becomes famous due to the fact that he saved the more than a thousand Jewish people during the Holocaust. He did this by giving them work in his factories, making them important to the war effort. Overall. I would say that it is one of the best films ever made, and it is something that I shall continue to watch over and over again.Have fun with the movie alex_der_bert"
Mr Lombardo,"Apr 24, 1999",1/10,"I've watched this film about half a dozen times over the last five years and I still don't really understand what Spielberg was trying to do.  Was he trying to outline the horrors of the holocaust or was he trying to examine Schindler himself - why the man did what he did? Maybe both.  In neither case does he succeed.  One can't help but feel the atrocities were greatly toned down for this film thus not really reflecting the true horror of what really happened, and he fails completely in exploring the character of Schindler.  Why did Schindler do what he did?  The man was a philanderer and a shrewd business man who didn't exactly go out of his way to be nice.  Did witnessing what he did make him wake up to himself or perhaps there was an ulterior motive?  Spielberg looks at none of this and serves up a modern day saint.  It is kind of ironic that Spielberg shot this movie in black and white because that is the approach he has taken to his subject material.  He gives us the saintly Schindler, the stereotypical evil Nazi, the honourable Jew and none of the complexities that made these people what they are.  This was Spielberg's attempt to become accepted as a serious film-maker but yet he takes exactly the same approach to making this as he did with his marvellous popcorn movies resulting in a rather dictatorial film that has more answers than questions!"

HakimZziwa,"Oct 9, 2017",10/10,"One of the on living legendary pieces made ever, you could easily cry, it is one of the movies I discovered way later only realizing that not every one of the people working with the Germans was bad, there were a few good ones.Also the dominant use of hard light in the film gave it the old 40's mood and vibe that made us feel as part of the people in that time.It is also interesting how the director chose to high light the girl in red a color that stood out in black and really made it very powerful.It was interesting to discover how good of an actor liam Neeson is given that time, because to be honest most people knew him from the film ""Taken"" at least for average movie watchers."
tolga-baki,"Oct 13, 2017",8/10,"This movie was one of the most beautiful and impressive films I have ever seen. It is very naturalistic and logical to make everything as objective and realistic as possible.

I would strongly recommend anyone watching. Good forums."

The film is well made, well acted, touching, moving and scary one in all. I like to say that this is one of Spilbergs best films."
moviemachine,"Apr 25, 2002",10/10,"""Schindler's List"" without a doubt has been one of the best movies I have ever seen. I am glad that it won a lot of Oscars including Best Picture and Best Director Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson is an excellent in that film also. Neeson stars as a Nazi Czech/German businessman named Oskar Schindler who owns a factory and saved more than 1100 Jews from being gassed at the Auschwitz concentration camp during the Holocaust. Concentration camp is a very bad place where people work on digging the dirt from sunrise to sunset. It is a sad film, but it is based on a true story and it is brilliant, too. ""Schindler's List"" is a movie that should be seen for any Liam Neeson, Ben Kingsley, Ralph Fiennes, Steven Spielberg, or any historical drama film or movie fans. Excellent! Tragic Ending with Jews putting rocks on Oskar Schindler's gravestone in the cemetery.10/10"
Caleb-2,"Jan 28, 1999",N/A,"Schindler's List is one of those movies that elicits such a strong reaction not only the first time one sees it, but every subsequent time that people often respond without fully being able to think through what they are saying. Personally, it is one of my favorites, as I have emerged from each viewing of it exhausted, torn, and enlightened from an experience explores many sides of humanity during one of the most terrifying times in recent history. Some, however, have responded very negatively to what they term historical inaccuracies, lack of focus on the real issues, or for others, overblown sentimentality.  Not being Spielberg, I have no idea what his intentions were, but I would argue that no single movie can ever truly capture the experience of an entire continent during a six year period or war, much less a 13 year period of Nazi rule in Germany.  Regardless of how incredible Schindler's List is, it should only be the first of many Holocaust movies to be made.  Thus, I agree with people who argue that there was more to the Holocaust than this film, but to not recognize the greatness of this film for that reason is simply ridiculous.  This movie explores human nature, therein lies its true greatness.  It asks each and every one of us to search the depths of our character, and ask ourselves what we would do in a situation where our moral, spiritual, and physical beings were threatened from every direction.  Do we really expect film to be reality?  I don't.  I go to movies to make me think, to make me look inward and learn something about myself, to tell explore a part of reality that I had not ever seen before.  Schindler's List does exactly this better than almost any other film through nearly flawless acting, beautiful cinematography, and a fantastic story, historically accurate or not.  I don't want to relive the Holocaust, I consider myself quite fortunate that I have never had, and hopefully never will have, to make the decisions facing either Stern, Goethe, or Schindler.  Instead, the Holocaust should be taught and learned about to discover more about humanity, hopefully to reach an understanding of ourselves that we can use in the future. That's what this film does; it's a work of art."
didi-5,"Jan 25, 2005",7/10,"The story of Oskar Schindler, adapted from Thomas Keneallay's book 'Schindler's Ark', was brought to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Liam Neeson gives a strong and powerful performance in the lead role, bringing a dignity and gravitas to the man who saved the people on his list from certain death at the hands of the Nazis.The film is in black and white, with the exception of the red dress of a small girl we follow in the Jewish ghetto, and a real-life coda at the end where the people saved by Schindler pay their respects to him. Was Schindler a great man, a humanitarian, or motivated by gain and greed? The film seems firmly in the first camp and in its other characters portrays certain stereotypes - the sensitive Jew played by Ben Kingsley, the sadistic SS man played by Ralph Fiennes.It doesn't flinch from showing the worst of the Holocaust, and rightly so. But - as the story unfolds and the small amount of people on the list are saved - there is hope within the unspeakable terrors of anti-Semitic propaganda. Along with 'The Color Purple', this is Spielberg's strongest work."
hans-c,"Feb 13, 2001",1/10,"It appears that the comments by IMDB users have to be every bit as black-and-white as the plot of the average Hollywood production? A film has to be either outstanding or miserable?Sorry, can't comply. I recommend Schindler's List to my friends on the basis of its beautiful photography and the outstanding performance by Ben Kingsley. I wouldn't have said that Ralph Fiennes and Liam Neeson do a great job. Charismatic though they both are, they just put on their usual stone faces for their respective parts.The film is definitely worth seeing, but I would argue that it's overrated all the same. Because... such an immoderate amount of praise has been heaped upon it. True, Spielberg's story about human kindness in adversity is a sweet and all-American story. But it doesn't have much to do with the black-in-black disaster that was the Holocaust."
lee_eisenberg,"Aug 7, 2005",10/10,"I can't possibly describe with words how great ""Schindler's List"" is. You can't realize it unless you watch it. Spielberg not only makes you feel like you're in the middle of it, but you continue feeling that way for hours after watching the movie. Liam Neeson does a top-notch job as Oskar Schindler, a man caught between loyalty to his government and the desire to save over 1,000 people. Equally good is Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, whom Schindler saves from getting exterminated, and then helps Schindler save more people. And Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, a Nazi Kommandant with plans to rape a Jewish woman. Like I said, I can't possibly describe how great this movie is. YOU HAVE TO SEE IT TO UNDERSTAND IT. 11/10."
tmfc-65132,"Jun 27, 2017",9/10,"How did Steven Spielberg make this and Jurassic park at the same time. Spielberg has had some misses in his collection of films, but this is one of his best. However this film would not be the same if it did not have the outstanding cast it has. Liam Neeson in my opinion is incredibly underrated mainly because of films like the taken trilogy and the phantom menace, but his performance in this is so believable as Schindler. Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes also are amazing in this and very convincing.This film is powerful in it's message and certain scenes could be hard for most people to watch, but this really happened to so many people in the second world war it's almost unbelievable as it's so extreme. I think this film definitely deserved all the Oscars it received as it is one of the most emotional and powerful films to ever be made."
clarkepaty-37685,"Oct 17, 2017",9/10,"this movie was so moving. the scene where Liam Neeson sees the little girls pink coat in color was so well shot. the movie could've been shorter though. I felt as though many scenes where unnecessary and not well related to the story line. the use of ""shot reverse shot"" was so well engineered and really showed how well Steven Spielberg can make a conversation flow."
Bobson10,"Jan 23, 2013",9/10,"""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire.""'Schindler's list is about the true story of Czech born Oskar Schindler, a businessman who tried to make his fortune during the Second World War by exploiting cheap Jewish labour, but ended up penniless having saved over 1000 Polish Jews from almost certain death during the holocaust.'Steven Spielberg's best film, by far! His camera work in the film is unique.40% of this film is used with a hand-held camera. There were no steadicams or crane shots used. His efforts were to make it look more like a documentary and his effects were great! The black and white effect used only adds to the depression. The editing of colour throughout is very powerful, examples include the candles burning, the girl in the red coat and the ending sequence.The acting presented is amazing. Liam Neeson brings an Academy Award worthy performance to the screen. His transition from a greedy business man to humanitarian is marvellous. Ralph Fiennes is also great in the film. He plays Amon Goeth, an SS officer who is sadistic and psychopathic, frequently murdering his prisoners for fun. A performance not many can accomplish. Ben Kingsley is amazing portraying Itzhak Stern. He makes my favourite scene. As Stern figures out that Schindler is using his own money to rescue Jews, his face expression says it all. Very emotional.The Score in this film is magic. In my opinion, it's the music that brings out the most of the emotion in the film. John Williams is brilliant!Schindler's List will not only go down as the best holocaust film ever made but one of the best films in the history of cinema."
lwood28,"Jul 2, 2014",10/10,"*Story: Schindler is a German businessman and when the Holocaust starts to begin he decides to have Jews come work for him which will help them stay out of the concentration camps. As long as the Jews stay out of those camps Schindler makes money.*Review: Schindler's List is probably one of the best movies that I have ever seen and ever made. What's really good about this movie is the acting. Liam Neeson proves that he can act and he should have won a Oscar for his performance as Oskar Schindler. Ralph Fiennes also gives a great performance and should have won a Oscar for his performance as Amon Goeth but since the academy doesn't give awards to actors that play as bad people is dumb. What I really liked about this movie is how the whole movie is shot in black and white it just makes the movie even better. While your watching this movie you feel really emotional inside. Everything about this movie is just perfect from the acting, cinematography, musical score, writing, and directing. This movie is intense, emotional, and apiece of art. In one word I can describe this movie ""MASTERPIECE"". This is probably one of Spielberg's best movies he has directed. Schindler's List is a movie that everyone should see once in their life.""This list... is an absolute good. The list is life. All around its margins lies the gulf"". - Itzhak Stern"
Riddler2,"Aug 1, 2015",N/A,"Steven Spielberg had already made Jurassic Park and blown us all away with the groundbreaking dinosaurs with Schindler's List he makes not a film but a memento a life lesson a historic important landmark a teaching resource which teaches the world about the Holocaust and the horrors it unleashed upon innocent people innocent people who did not deserve what they had to suffer through for no reason! I will tell you a story about how I discovered this landmark Masterpiece At School recently My teacher Simon Strange was teaching us all about the Holocaust and explaining what happened all those years ago and showed us a video and spoke in great detail about hatred and intolerance and crimes against humanity and he spoke to me and said I will never forget this conversation I know You love Steven Spielberg's Films very Much?

johnnyboyz,"Oct 25, 2010",7/10,"Schindler's List begins with the striking of a match and the consequent lighting of a candle in a small room; an action which illuminates the rest of the locale and sheds light on those in the form of people and items around it. Steven Spielberg's film is a piece which goes on to shed degrees of light on a man, whose titular list and what it incurs, is the harrowing but brutally honest subject for this three hour true-to-life experience. Shot in black and white amongst deathly downcast greys which combine brilliantly with chillingly cold white in the form of snow and general skyline, Schindler's List unfolds amidst a bleak time of murder and pillage but will go on to focus on a ray of hope or salvation in the form of Nazi businessman Oskar Schindler; specifically, his work on the Eastern Front during World War 2 that saw him save and aid a vast number of Jewish people destined for slaughter.Liam Neeson plays the man, a factory owner of Czech origin living in the year 1939 about embark on a period of six or so years which will change his life and many of those he comes to interact with, forever. When we first encounter Oskar, he neatly lays his shirts out across a bed during preparation for an evening out; his room neat and very formal, large sums of spare money sitting idly in a nearby draw for whatever reason suggesting a rich or high lifestyle. The measure of the man in his charismatic abilities is are established when Schindler arrives at an function in the evening full of German Nazi officials; light entertainment in the form of cabaret as well as food and drink which is already flowing. When he first enters, very few people seem to know of him, but by the end of the evening he appears to have wedged himself in amongst everybody as the centre of attention and entertainment. At a function in which all of the other Nazi officials seem greyed out by the, Schindler comes to have a white ray of light fly over his face suggesting there's a little more to this man than just mere self-indulgence and death.Schindler's goals are entirely infused with tendencies that veer towards Capitalism, his dealing with the Nazi party officials see him enter a business proposition that'll have him enter with nothing but come away with a great deal of something. The situation as to whether we are on the side of Oskar in the initial stages is additionally challenged when it transpires if The War were to end, Schindler's enterprise might falter so the longer that most of the activity happening in and around everybody at this time continues, it's going to be pretty good for business. Inbetween all of this, The Second World War reaches somewhat of an infamous crescendo in and around the locality of Central Europe; The Holocaust causing widespread Jewish demotion into set Ghettos, later followed by evacuations leading onto murder for them but a severe clashing of morality for Schindler whom comes to realise employing these proverbial lambs to the slaughter would go a long way in saving them.The film is a high end piece of drama, balancing a character's gradual struggle with being able to offer salvation really well with its meshing of the war genre. Spielberg's gradual dragging of his lead away from a self-obsessed businessman always looking out for ways to make money out of the system into this mournful, regretful man makes for wonderful viewing. By the time he is weeping, towards the end, at what has happened or more importantly what hasn't happened in the saving of more Jewish people, we feel the need to weep with him - thus successfully aligning the audience with this figure whom was once how he was in his indulgent, Nazi function attending self. The comparison is somewhat bookended very simply in how it is both Schindler as a stand alone man and how the Nazis as a collective group go about the employment of the Jews and the manner in which they treat them in a physical sense. Where Schindler will come to offer hope and salvation in the shape of factory employment, regardless of ability or handicap, an early scene will see German soldiers ruthlessly eliminate an elderly man because of his inability to successfully carry out what it is they ask of him through their charging him with a task, namely, the shovelling away of snow so as to clear a public road.Schindler comes to stand in direct opposition to a fearsome Nazi Captain of the S.S. named Amon Göth (Fiennes), Göth additionally being based on a true to-life individual. Like Schindler, Göth is running a business or operation in which management and organisation are key; but while both members of the Nazi party and sharing similar basic ingredients as to their respective action plans, the men couldn't be any further apart in character. Göth arrives on the scene, a Kraków suburb called Płaszów, to help in the construction of a new concentration camp; the house on the hill he's charged with living in a dominant position in which he is able to overlook all of his work – construction orientated or otherwise. Just as Schindler goes out of his way to 'select' an aide or assistant in the form of Ben Kingsley's Itzhak Stern, Göth himself goes through a similar process of 'selecting' a assistant he renders a maid-come-slave in the form of a young Jewish woman. The measure of Fiennes' performance as Göth is highlighted in his ability to have the motivational ""tonight is history"" monologue prior to a ghetto liquidation come across as just as chilling as the act of liquidation itself. The film is an exhausting watch; an enthralling character study set amidst dark and desperate times as a man's shifting viewpoints play out."
QStrum,"Apr 14, 2000",10/10,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor.  The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men.  He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business.  But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered.  That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer).  At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't. This film is a must see by me.  I give the film an ""A+"" (wishing I could give it a higher grade than that) and a 10 out of 10..."
DEEPAK_HEISENBERG,"Jan 10, 2025",10/10,"The cinematography is nothing short of masterful. The use of shadows and muted colours enhances the somber tone of the film, while close-up shots of the characters' faces capture the raw emotion and desperation they endure. The film create an atmosphere that lingers long after the credits roll. ""Schindler's List"" is more than just a film; it's a poignant reminder of the human cost of war and the atrocities committed during one of history's darkest periods. It's a story of suffering, but also of courage and the unyielding spirit of those who fought to survive against unimaginable odds. This film serves as a powerful testament to the enduring impact of history and the importance of remembering those who were lost."

yml-35854,"Jan 31, 2025",10/10,"Directed by Steven Spielberg and shot in just 72 days, Schindler's List is a stunningly detailed depiction of the Holocaust and Oskar Schindler's saving of thousands of Jews by bringing them to work in his factory. The film is an unparalleled representation of the evil of humanity being counteracted by the good, and the good found in saving any life that one can. The film is all black-and-white save for the ending and the girl in the red jacket, which Spielberg says represents the bleakness of hope that those in the concentration camp felt. It's not just this little girl that shows the true horrors that the Jewish people faced, though: Spielberg does not hold back when depicting the death and dehumanization carried out by the Nazis, increasing our perception of Schindler even more as he attempts to save as many lives as possible."
anu_kaura,"Feb 13, 2022",10/10,"Words cannot express how beautifully made this film is, and how compelling the journey of Schindler and his workforce inspires some hope and good in a world of absolute darkness. A must watch, despite the gruesome reality of the content matter."
Oscar85,"Mar 23, 2000",10/10,"To sum up Spielberg's masterwork in one word is a nearly impossible task, but I have come to the conclusion that Schindler's List is perfect. Liam Neeson as Oskar Schindler is truly great in recreating the role of a modern day Moses. Making this film all the more compelling is John Williams' perfectly composed original musical score. This film deserves all the awards bestowed upon it, especially best picture by the National Board of Review and the Academy and the Academy Award for best director Steven Spielberg. It deserves all these awards and more. Schindler's List is a film that everyone should see and appreciate to its fullest extent. Spielberg will remain an immortal filmmaker through the work he put into this film."

This film's only ""bad thing"" is that it's in black and white but this believe it or not gives it even more beauty. I think that this movie is suitable for kids 12 and up if they are watching it with their parents. Also remember that is film is based on a true story. Schindler was a man who helped the Nazis in many ways (suplying weapons etc)but he did not think that what was being done to the Jews was right so he helped many of them who are still alive today and many who left their children to tell the story."
gaboon-17388,"Apr 7, 2017",5/10,Excellent movie by Spielberg showing the horrors Jews had to go through in World war 2.

Definitely recommended.
Bungle-9,"Jan 29, 2000",10/10,"In a sentence, this film was excellence. Spielberg depicts the plight of the Jews in the WWII Holocaust era with a frightening amount of detail, and thus ensures that we don't easily forget what they were put through. I liked the way it was shot in B&W, as Spielberg knows that most people have only seen the war in B&W (on TV and the like), which a lot of people seem to fail to realise. Also, when he does add colour, it gives the audience a lasting impression.The cast was wonderful, the three main leads being excellent in their performances (Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes) and the supporting cast were just as good. Janusz Kaminski's camerawork was brilliant. John Williams score was incredibly moving, and deserved the Oscar. The music is easily related to Jewish styles of the period. On the whole, a brilliant film, unforgettable, and a lesson to all. It shows that even the most hardened people can change."
ohiorock,"Mar 14, 2000",10/10,"One thousand words, the maximum for this review, are hardly enough to describe the direct impact this film had on me as well as some of my friends.  Spielberg does a wonderful job depicting the harsh reality of Jewish Life back in the early 1940's.  I vaguely remember one of his comments before the first commercial free showing of this film on NBC:  ""We must not forget the tragedy these Jews had to endure...""  I am thoroughly convinced that I will never ever forget this movie now or 50 years from now. Schindler's List is powerful in direction, hypnotic in nature, and perfect in form.  One of the best films of all time, if not THE best.  Simply a great work, well deserving of all of its Oscars, especially Best Picture. I applaud you, Mr. Spielberg."
aidosh94,"Jun 18, 2007",10/10,"Steven Spielberg makes one of (if not the one) his greatest movies of all time. Liam Neeson gives a great performance as Schindler and the whole film is just powerful, amazing and sad but it doesn't matter because the movie is so good. Ralph Fiennes makes an even better performance as Goeth, a man who made everyone stare into the screen with anger and sadness and that is just what a movie is supposed to do-make you feel sad, happy, angry or effect you in some way. I read that someone thought it was overrated and bad, but I think it's a classic and it'll never go away. So if you want to see one of the greatest historical films ever made, then go see Schindler's List.EDIT: I wrote this when I was 12 or 13, and I'm so sorry about my AWFUL English...

SCHINDLER'S LIST ' is my choice along with Life Is Beautiful(1997);  The Sixth Sense(1999);  The Godfather 2(1974);  Braveheart(1995);  Se7en(1995); Crimson Tide(1995);  Unbreakable(2000);  Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon(2000);  The Great Dictator(1940);  Terminator 2:Judgement Day(1991); Dog Day Afternoon(1975);  Kramer Vs.Kramer(1979);  Saving Private Ryan(1998);  Artificial Intelligence(2001);  Raging Bull(1980); Philadelphia(1993) and many more ...!Usually, I don't approve myself of providing ranks to my 'personal 40 Favourite Masterpieces of All Time' but this one is an EXCEPTION and I rank this movie as 'The Number One'.My humble suggestion : 1. To all those who had the luck of watching this masterpiece before - DON'T WAIT. GO and BUY a CD or a DVD whatever you get your hands on and enjoy this movie for your lifetime.  2. To those who haven't yet watched IT - DON'T WAIT, GO and RENT IT / watch IT in a theatre on the very first chance you get. And now PLEASE don't complaint of not having enough money to buy or even rent it. SELL YOUR CHILDREN IF YOU NEED TO GET MONEY BUT DON'T WAIT FOR THE NEXT NINE YEARS TO WATCH THIS MASTERPIECE.   Needless to say, I rate this masterpiece a 10 out of 10."
leonardoanamorim,"Jul 20, 2016",10/10,"Steven Spielberg is a known director. Most of his works focus on adventures, genre movies, be it with children, explorers or Extra- Terrestrial beings. So, when Spielberg decides to focus on historical dramas, usually based on true events, we can see the full array of his abilities and capacities.Schindler's List is a movie that occurs during the holocaust, and this time period serves as background for characters study. Spielberg was smart enough to realize that such a theme could not be tackled head on. Instead, the focus is on the humans of the time. Why they did what they did, how could they and, specially, how they endured it.The narrative focus on the actions of ""entrepreneur"" Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson). How he dealt with the holocaust and how he was touched by the Jews situation after seeing their torment and suffering. He had to take care to not have such a feeling be discovered by any of his many Nazi friends, such as Amon Goeth (Ralph Fiennes).Being a Jew himself, Spielberg finds the fine line between homage to those who died and survived without falling in any melodrama. Spielberg is, above all, a director. And a director has only one obligation: to make a good film. Even though directors are human beings, Spielberg is professional enough to know how much he really must use of his emotion, sensibility and identification with the victims of the holocaust.It's safe to say that this is one of the best Spielberg films. For many, like me, his best. A historical piece with much to add in the discussion of mankind tragedies."
lecrae_fanatic,"May 26, 2016",10/10,"Unlike the film, I'm going to make this review short and sweet. Schindler's List is the single greatest film I have ever had the pleasure of viewing. It has brilliant casting with Liam Neeson taking on the role of Oskar Schindler, Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth, Ben Kingsley as Itzhak Stern, and Embeth Davidtz as Helen Davidtz. All four put on outstanding performances, but personally I'd say Ralph Fiennes gives his best performance of all time in this film. He displays the beautiful struggle of a man who does the unthinkable without thinking, yet behind closed doors fights with an inner turmoil. The cinematic decisions made in this film also pay off brilliantly. The choice to keep a large portion of the film in black and white adds to the authenticity of the piece, yet the subtle colouring of the little girl in the red dress adds emphasis just where it needs to be. Aside from all the details, the story is one of few that really got to me, and in the end that is why I must say it is the greatest movie of all time."
the-fearless-america,"Jun 2, 2016",10/10,"Schindlers list is one of movie which depict the true skill of our legendary Spielberg. Shot in black and white, Spielberg want to present the classic vintage and dramatically dark of world war 2 history. I should say this is the best movie which Spielberg made from perspective of cinematography, casting, and art direction. Yes, this is a near perfect movie.Storytelling of the movie itself constantly shuttling from deep to solid. The writing definitely gives Neeson to dig his character fastidiously. While the antagony delivers dogmatic and deleterious performance, the protagony also delivers benevolent and empathetic character. Well, i should say Spielberg seldomly made a real serious movie here, but when he did, it was terrific.Inspirational, this movie keeps deliver a solid writing, tough performance, and precious cinematography. This is one of movie that could change people. This movie have such magnificent power to do that while have a self-perpetuating charisma to stand as classic."
bob the moo,"Mar 23, 2003",N/A,"As Nazi Germany invades Poland, opportunist Oscar Schindler sees a chance to open a factory serving the military and using Jews for labour.  However, as the full horror of the war on the Jewish people becomes ever more clear, Schindler's selfishness turns more into compassion for his fellowman.Having spent 10 weeks watching `Taken' and remembering just how awful Spielberg can be when he is being mushily sentimental, I revisited this film as it was showing in the build up to the TV coverage of the 2003 Oscar ceremony.  It is a powerful film simply because Spielberg manages to keep the mush out of it and just let the events speak for themselves.  When people are shot on the street there is no John Williams music or slow-motion, they simply fall in a bloody heap and the film moves on.  This makes it shockingly cold and that is the aim.The story is difficult to summarise because a surprising amount of it is spent away from the story of Schindler and on the plight of the Jews generally.  Again this theme within the narrative stops to wandering and allows it to be impacting.  True there is an element of `look what happened, isn't this terrible?' about it, but not too much.  In the final hour in particular it gets a little sentimental but not to the point of spoiling things.Neeson's Schindler makes you wonder why he wasn't able to get any character into his recent role in Star Wars I.  Here he keeps Schindler a complex man, driven by a mix of selfishness and compassion but Spielberg simplifies him a bit towards the end (but I may be being a bit picky).  Fiennes' Goeth is also wonderfully drawn.  A cold blooded killer no doubt but also not painted without his own complexities and Fiennes holds the focus whenever he is onscreen.  The support cast are all excellent right down to extras  if you think it is easy to scream and wail convincingly then you should compare this to Kate Capshaw in Indiana Jones!  I never doubted that any of the actors were anything but the characters they played.Spielberg rightly won his Oscars for this and his direction is excellent. Although I do dislike him immensely when he goes all `apple pie' on us, he is great at what he does and this is one of his best films since Jaws.  A powerful, moving film that is moving for all the right reasons and not just because John Williams cranks in.  Difficult to watch but worth the effort."
bosco9765,"Jun 24, 2002",7/10,"The movies should inspire, and provide a view of things the way they ought to be.  Schindler is both.  This is probably the most difficult movie you will ever watch.  The liquidation of the ghetto, for instance, or the shower scene, are among the most heartbreaking images ever filmed.  Yet this movie might cause you to rethink the meaning of egoism when you see it manifested in this enigmatic man."
jacobjohntaylor1,"May 30, 2017",4/10,This is an awful movie. It has an awful story. It is very slow and boring. It is not fun to watch at all. I do not know why it got an 8.9. Just because people like sad boring movie. I do not like sad boring movie. If I want to be sad and bored I will just live my life. I do not need a movie to remind me how sad and boring life is. This is 4. It is not a 8.9 that is just hype. Do not wast your time. Do not wast your money. Do not see this movie. It a long movie and life is to short. If was a long movie and it was something good to see like Lord of the rings then it would worth the time. This is not. Good actors wasted there time being in this awful movie.
sean.sankey,"Dec 17, 2001",10/10,"I took my Mother to see this movie precisely because I thought it would be one of those 'special' movies. I have lived in the USA for several years now and only visit England 2-3 times a year and I like to take my Mother to the movies when I go home as she does not get to go very often.I had no idea how moving a movie could be. I have been told that this movie is not as moving as the 'real footage' of what actually happened but how could it ever be? Especially if your family was involved in this nightmare.However, for me this movie was the most moving I have ever seen. I have never walked out of a cinema and attempted to say something but could not because my words were choked back by the emotion in me. In deed, there were many times that the tears were flowing and not because of cheap cinematic tricks but because the way this story was presented was so effective that I could not help myself become immersed in the realism of the horror that un-folded but at the same time showing that there can be humanity even in those we least expect.In two words - Amazing and Humbling, easily my number one film, even though it is difficult to experience, anyone remotely interested in film HAS to see this."

dalton2,"Aug 6, 1998",10/10,"Undoubtedly, this is a masterpiece, one of the most recent ones created in cinema history. Can a movie about the holocaust be beautiful? Of course it can, and here we have an example. We have more than three hours of poetry about the human nature, about love, about hate, about madness, about egoism, about altruism, all of them mixed to produce the human being as what it really is. It's a film that cleans our soul, makes us feel like humans, and makes us understand a little bit better the aim of the Human Race. John Williams gave the most beautiful sound-track he ever created to set the emotional background this film needed."

pinbyte,"Mar 13, 2007",N/A,"I dare not rate this film but only give some thoughts. If I was watching it to be entertained, it would receive a negative number. If I was watching it strictly with a critical eye as to judge if it is a well made film, I might have to give it an 11. Be it contrivance or not, this is the most powerful and disturbing film I have ever experienced.The violent and disturbing scenes depicted in this film are based in fact. They are recent history for that matter. That makes it very hard to endure. And worse, the inhumanity of genocide continues to this very day. I have little doubt that the scenes depicted in this film are tame compared to the realities of what occurred at Krakow and elsewhere.The film brought me there convincingly, and the pain was there. It was hard to watch, and disturbing as I ponder that at any moment a political tide might derail my own life.There are characters that kill for sport. But these are not characters. These are characterizations of real evil people that recently existed, recreated in the film based on the recollections of those who have witnessed the atrocities. Then there is Schindler, who is not characterized as sweet, but as a unique person who will not trade inhumanity for money. It is quite an intriguing story.On one hand, I say this movie should be seen by every human being on the planet. On the other hand, I have found that this movie has brought within me a feeling of depression that is long lasting. For sure, we must not forget the Holocaust. With a revived knowledge of this history from viewing this film my eyes will be more open.I could have spent my time more enjoyably. But this well-made film has a reason to exist. You won't care unless you watch it. Yet, you will pay the price whether or not you are indifferent to the messages in this film. You will never forget it.I propose that is the point of it."
CHAODA_,"Jan 16, 2025",7/10,"Schindler's List is a deeply moving portrayal of the Holocaust, capturing the horror of one of history's darkest times with raw honesty. The film highlights the contrast between human cruelty and compassion, focusing on Oskar Schindler's transformation from a profit-driven businessman to a savior of over a thousand Jewish lives.The stark black-and-white cinematography mirrors the bleakness of the era, while moments like the girl in the red coat serve as powerful symbols of innocence and loss. The film emphasizes the importance of individual actions in the face of overwhelming evil, leaving viewers with a profound message about humanity and moral responsibility.This is more than a historical drama-it's a reminder of the resilience of the human spirit and the impact of choosing to do good."
ckphilip,"Nov 21, 2005",1/10,"I don't know what to say about this movie. I had never seen it, so when I received it this spring I was eager to watch it. I find the subject of the Holocaust to be fascinating (not in a good way) because it's just astounding that this actually happened. It baffles the mind how this could occur on such a grand scale. I'm always watching shows on the history channel about WWII and the Holocaust and so I had very high expectations for this movie. So, I put it in my DVD player and sat down to watch a movie about a subject that I have a lot of interest in. Three hours later I felt as if every ounce of life had been sucked from my body. I was bored to death. I could never get emotionally attached to anyone in the movie. I know this sounds bad but I never felt sorry for anyone in this film. This film felt like it had no real vision or direction and it never bothered to develop any characters; everyone in the movie came across as wooden figures to me.Now comes the real question; should a person watch a movie about the Holocaust expecting to be entertained? Well, the answer to this question is both yes and no. You shouldn't be entertained because it covers such a dark subject but anyone who enjoys history could be entertained because it covers significant event in human history. This where the film fails. It covers the event but it doesn't attempt to make the movie interesting, Spielberg must of decided that the subject matter alone was interesting enough and left it at that.I can watch a show about the Holocaust on the history channel and I will be more emotionally attached to the people in that one hour show than I will be to anyone in that three hour boring film, Schlinder's List. I'm sorry but that's poor execution on Spielberg's part."
broaded,"Apr 5, 2018",10/10,"For years, the Oscar eluded master filmmaking Steven Spielberg, from timeless classics to box office blockbusters, he was revered for making big budget entertainment, but was dismissed by other film directors and film critics for making so many family friendly films.That all changed in 1993, when he directed what was at that time the biggest grossing film in history, Jurassic Park and followed by 1993's Best Picture and Best Director, Schindler's List.Schindler's List isn't just a film it's an experience cf the Holocaust so stunning and so upsetting that it completely changed Spielberg as a director. It won virtually every Best Picture award on the planet, from the BAFTA, to the Golden Globe to the Academy Award for Best Picture and rightfully so.This and Saving Private Ryan prove that Steven Spielberg, NOT James Cameron is the true king of filmmaking now and forever. To deny that is to deny the absolute truth of the matter."

sol-,"Jan 8, 2005",10/10,"The most amazing thing about this film is that it was not made to be an epic or an acclaimed film. Spielberg made it as a personal film for himself and other Jews affected by the Holocaust. There is nothing flashy about the film except for Neeson's bravura performance. Spielberg's usual style is invisible, and the cinematography and editing, although excellent, are not shown off to make a spectacle of the film or give it an epic feel. Yet it is still a compulsive, involving, and utterly heart-wrenchingly moving filming of a part of history that should not be forgotten. The screenplay is one of the best ever written: it captures the stories of so many Holocaust survivors but without distracting from the main story at hand. The black and white photography and editing is perfect, and John Williams provides a perfectly subtle but nice music score. The acting is simply brilliant, with Liam Neeson towering as Oskar Schindler, and Ralph Fiennes bringing out the Nazi character Amon Goeth into full flesh. And Ben Kingsley and Embeth Davidtz give off excellent performances too. The film also has a lot to say about absolute power corrupting and spiraling out of control, and such a message of the film can be applied to any time and crisis, not just the Holocaust. This is not just one of the the ten best films ever produced, but it shall remain so for years to come, because its messages in terms of power and racism are applicable in any age."
Quinoa1984,"Feb 13, 2000",10/10,"Steven Spielberg has his best masterpiece here with Schindler's list.  It is also his most personal work to say the least.  And what he brings to the screen is like nothing the world has ever seen before- a true to life depiction of the horror known as the holocaust.The story brings us Oskar Schindler, a German munitions chief who brings thousands of Polish Jews from the death camps to his factory and saves them. The acting is spectacular with Liam Neeson as Schindler, the man who changes throughout the film, Ben Kigsley as Schindler's Jewish accountant (and conscience), and Ralph Fiennes in his best performance yet as the frightening German commander.  Along with a frighteningly haunting score by John Williams and great Photography by Janusz Kaminski, Spielberg has created a film that will remain with us forever.  Haunting, dramatic and true in the art form, this is one of the best masterpieces of cinema ever made."
dhruvasomayaji,"Jul 23, 2011",9/10,"It is said ""power corrupts; but absolute power corrupts absolutely"". This movie just gives a glimpse of the possible effects if the power is vested with some insane person with a mindless hatred towards a group of people just because of their birth.I had not judged Hitler to the fullest before seeing this movie even though many were condemning him to be the cruelest dictator the world has ever seen. After seeing it, I am convinced of the fact that he was really so. The fact that 6 million Jews were massacred during the world war-2 just because they were Jews is a shame on the entire humanity.The movie gives an account of the polish Jews during the Second World War and how the protagonist, Oscar Schindler saves 1200 Jews from being gassed. The cinematography is simply brilliant. It gives a sense of timelessness to the movie. Also, not to forget some wonderful performances. All factors make the movie very realistic. No wonder it is one of the best movies in many lists and deservedly won the academy award for the year 1993. Steven Spielberg will be remembered as an iconic director even if all of his other movies are discounted.In the days where negationism of the Nazis' atrocities is getting stronger and the killings are being justified, this movie is a harsh reminiscence of the black era of Europe."
John-423,"Nov 9, 2002",1/10,"I admit, I have never been a big fan of Steven Spielberg. I must also admit however that I have a great deal of respect for his charming and subsequent brainwashing of Hollywood, and how easily he has made himself a brand name that always commands respect despite having made some of Hollywood's most overrated and tired films. With Schindler's List he truly created some powerful images, thought provoking and inciting in how they make you react...BUT... That's about where it ends. The talent of Steven lies in his ability to pull the strings of an audience, and in placing his propaganda so effectively, yet in this film with such a weak cast (other than Ralph Fiennes who was very effective as opposed to the generally weak and painful to watch Liam Neeson) and tired subject he breaks no new ground. Not to say it did not have its beautiful scenes, the executions and murders were poignant and well done, but lost much of their effect being coupled with so much overdone melodrama and sap. Its about time Hollywood wakes up, we need new directors who are bold yet sensible enough to know that there is no such thing as too far, but are intelligent enough to make a film that can rely on something other than pure shock, and that sometimes just a little is not enough and this is perfect evidence of that point. This film would have been excellent had a master such as Stanley Kubrick made it, but as it stands Schindlers List garners a 2 out of 10 in my eyes and is one of Spielberg's better films, but if nothing else its far superior to ET and the wretched Saving Private Ryan."
liang79,"Jan 4, 2000",N/A,""" I....pardon you.""These words spoken by Amon Goethe (Ralph Fiennes) during the film can be aptly used to signify the themes of this film: power and forgiveness.I am part of the post war generation who has been lucky enough not to experience any major war. And after watching this film, I have deep respect and feelings for those who suffered during these times, be it the Holocaust or the Nam war. This film was just waiting to be made and I'm glad it was the right man who dared to take up the challenge. Any other person would not have done it justice.The film focuses on how a German named Oskar Schindler saved the lives of thousands of Jews by employing them to work in his factory during WWII. However, I feel the film's primary aim is not to show us Schindler's kindness but the horrors of war. There are some of the most true and graphic scenes here ever captured on celluloid. People being shot for no particular reason, hiding in fear, stripped and gased, abused......so much so that viewers watching it for the 1st time will be deeply affected. We have never got to see this ""flip side"" of the war in many Hollywood productions which only focuses on action and their unrealistic ""gung-ho"" heroes. ( Another excellent film would be ""Saving Pte Ryan"" by Spielberg again ) War and its horrors are finally and faithfully recreated for the audience.Like the film Raging Bull, its shot beautifully in black and white to reflect the era and tone of the film. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes are excellent, esp the latter for his frightening protrayal of Amon Goethe. The scene where they discuss about power is a classic and the subsequent one where Amon 'pardons' a young jew remains as one of my many favs!"
willwoodmill,"Feb 17, 2016",9/10,"In the early 90s Steven Spielberg had built a reputation as being the master of kid-friendly family films like E.T., Jaws, The Indiana Jones trilogy, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Hook, the list just goes on and on. Sure today he has films like Munich and Saving Private Ryan under his belt so Spielberg making a non kid-friendly film isn't very strange to us, but back then it was unheard of. So considering his previous career, Schindler's List might be the biggest departure from style any director has made in the history of film making.Even if you are among the more ""experienced"" film goers, meaning people who have seen several incredibly violent, disgusting, and down right disturbing films, Schindler's List will still make your stomach turn, and you'll want to look away at some of the more graphic moments in the film. Stephen Spielberg really does not hold back, and tries to give an uncompromising depiction of the holocaust, which in the earlier 90s was not something that was commonly done, sure you had films like Night and Fog, and Shoah, but your average, everyday Joe wasn't going to ever see those films. And there were films like Sophie's Choice, and Judgement at Nuremberg, but they really focused on the after math, and didn't really directly confront their audience the same way that Schindler's List so boldly did.Schindler's List is a biopic about Oskar Schindler, a member of the Nazi Party, who is runs a factory, in German occupied Poland, that uses Jews as workers. Oskar Schindler is played ever so greatly by Liam Neeson in what is definitely his best role yet (in my opinion Tom Hanks robbed him of the best actor Oscar). One of the best things about Schindler's List is the character of Oskar Schindler, Oskar Schindler was obviously not a righteous hero throughout the entirety of the film. After all he was a member of the Nazi party, and some viewers may take issue with this, but the film would be so much more dull and lose its complexity and depth, if Schindler was a straight forward hero fighting the bad guys. The way Stephen Spielberg presents it is far more interesting, (after all Stephen Spielberg said he was drawn to the paradoxical nature of Oskar Schindler) and far more accurate to the real life Oskar Schindler, and accuracy is something that Schindler's List strives for. The film was based upon the real life testimonies and accounts of the people who survived the events.Steven Spielberg at first did not want to direct Schindler's List, he didn't think he was ""mature"" enough to handle something as serious as a holocaust film. But eventually decided to do it himself when he saw the rising number of holocaust deniers. Which is probably why he also wanted the film to be as close to reality as possible, he wanted something that would challenge the audience, confront them with the true horrors of the holocaust.Earlier I talked about how great Liam Neeson's performance was, but Ben Kingsley, (who plays a Jewish account, who works for Oskar Schindler) and Ralph Fiennes (who plays an S.S. Officer in charge of a work camp.) both do amazing jobs, Ralph Fiennes was even nominated for best supporting actor at the academy awards. The cinematography, done by Janusz Kaminski who would later do Saving Private Ryan and Minority Report, is also perfect, it is probably among the greatest looking contemporary black & white films out there. The film is also scored by the legendary John Williams, (which is all you really need to know) after John Williams first saw the film, he said it was to beautiful and he was not worthy to score it, the only people that were worthy were dead. Schindler's List won the academy award for both cinematography and soundtrack. Schindler's List was also the first time Steven Spielberg ever won an actual Oscar. (he had previously won the Irving G. Thalberg award but that is just a lifetime achievement award.)Schindler's List was films on a relatively small budget of 22 million dollars, and Steven Spielberg did not accept any money for making the film, he said it would be like accepting blood money. But you would never be able to guess that Schindler's List was shot on a budget a 1/3 of the size of Jurassic Park. The sets are so massive and pay such close attention to detail, and the film was actually shot in the real life locations of where it takes place. The reason Schindler's List was shot on such a small budge was because the Steven Spielberg and the producers thought a holocaust film might bomb, and Steven Spielberg was not known for making R rated films. The film did not bomb it grossed over 320 million dollars world wide, which is over 1/2 a billion dollars in 2016 dollars.I'm not going to pretend that Schindler's List is flawless, perhaps its biggest flaw is the fact that 90% of the film is in English, which really clashes with Spielberg's intent to keep the film as close to reality as possible, and really can take you out of some scenes. Though I could see this not bothering most viewers, because the actors do such a great job portraying the people their playing that it would be hard to imagine anyone else in their roles.Steven Spielberg accomplished his goal of making a holocaust film that would not only be as close to the actual events as physically possible, but he also made it accessible to all audiences, (but for some of the more sheltered viewers, it would be a bit much.)9.4/10"
britneyblackwell,"May 24, 2016",9/10,Schindler's list takes a look into one of the most compelling visual pieces of the Holocaust. The black and white movie will take you into a journey of what it was like for Schindler and his thought on hiding Jews during the 1940s. You will love the ending and will feel the horrors experienced by the Jewish people during this time. There is a small splash of color in this movie which is figurative once you see it. This film will take you through a range of emotions and will impact your take on what people had to do to survive. The movie is a must see for all adults and is a completely true story. It is perhaps one of my favorite films.
Ferdylicious,"Mar 22, 2017",10/10,"Probably I watched it 3 times with different friends. Every single time I discovered new impacts on me. Im sure if I would watch it again, it would certainly hit me in the heart again. Liam Neeson's acting was unforgettable and the last scene of the movie with this dialogues: "" I could have gotten one more person and I didn't ..."" it's gonna be always remembered by me. Highly Recommended ;)"
hacoach,"Apr 21, 2017",10/10,"It was the perfect story, the perfect backdrop to show the un-showable, to reveal the horror of horrors and Spielberg knew it. This man Schindler, this vain, greedy, con man, his transformation from a nobody trying to scheme the system, into one of the great heroes of modern times, is the magic trick that delivers the movie. How did it happen, how did this man of all people, throw a fortune away, and risk life and limb in the very heart of evil, that is the question. So many did nothing, so many did evil in the name of duty, so few heroes, but there were heroes, heroes of the type that saved humanity by showing even under the worst possible circumstances, mankind has the capacity to rise to the occasion. Evil is in abundance, and Schindler is outnumbered, but many heroes emerged in the holocaust, not just Schindler, many hid Jews, many spirited Jews to safety but few were as outnumbered and at the very heart of the holocaust as Schindler. How do you protect, and keep 1,100 people from being murdered, and do it all out in the open, only the best conman could have done it, its almost as if Schindler trained his whole life, all his cons, all his act and charisma finely tuned, just so he could pull off the greatest scheme of them all, tricking the Nazi's out of 1,100 Jewish souls.While Schindler and Goth battle it out miles above the Jews like New Gods, one with the complete power of life and death over the Jews, the other working as hard as he can to save them. It is Itzhak Stern ( Ben Kingsley who is superb) who is the soul of the movie, the classy and dignified Stern is a Jewish man who overnight has lost his rights to be called human, the Nazis have stripped him of everything but that humanity, which he somehow manages to cling to.It is through Stern that we see the transformation in Schindler, as first Stern will not even take a drink with Schindler by the end Stern looks at Schindler with an almost spiritual reverence reserved for the greatest of people. the reverence held for very very special people.We see the slow transformation of Schindler, jump started by a fateful horse ride in the Polish countryside, it is here that Schindler first see's the little girl in the red coat, a beautiful angelic child relegated to extinction by Hitler and his monsters, this is the beginning for Schindler, the push, the horror is revealed to him. the second time he see's the girl in the red coat, she is among the dead in a wheel barrel full of corpses being wheeled to a fire to be incinerated. Her life snuffed out like a candle. This is the moment when Schindler knows he must act, that all the money in the world is worthless to a man who cannot sleep at night., or escape the guilt of not acting when so much depended on people acting.From that moment on Schindler is relentless in protecting his Jews, the Schindler Jews, he overcomes every obstacle the Nazi's place in front of him, he bargains with the very devil himself, and wins. But not till the last day of the war, and even then can he rest. The Nazi's were relentless in their thirst for Jewish blood and Schindler had to be just as relentless.A masterpiece and a historical look at Mankind's darkest hour, which will live for a thousand years as testament , the thousand years the Nazis thought their Reich, which ended in flame, destruction and the embarrassment and blight on the character of mankind. Thankfully there were men like Schindler to show the other side of what mankind was capable of, and can aspire to be."
lukaswernig,"Feb 12, 2014",10/10,"I just watched this movie recently, after postponing it for years and years. 3 1/2 hours or so just seemed to daunting.I am glad I did finally watch it with my roommate. We both thought it was the best film by Steven Spielberg by far and easily one of the best movies ever made.All the performances were top notch and it tells an important part of our history which many people do not even know about. It is brutal, it shows people getting executed, huge piles of bodies being burnt and much much more. It made me as well as my roommate tear up several times and it became harder and harder to hold the tears back as we both would have sobbed without being able to stop.The end is also very emotional when Liam Neeson's character, Schindler, realizes he could have saved many more lives if he had not spent so much of his money. The film ends with the actual survivors visiting Oskar Schindler's grave and paying tribute to his unforgettable achievements once again.Unfortunately I can only give this masterpiece only 10 out of 10 points. There are not enough stars to give to this movie."
KelticKarma,"Sep 10, 2002",1/10,"Is it possible for Spielberg to make a film that isn't horrendously mawkish ? Can someone please turn off his sentimentality button ?Viewed nearly ten years after its making, this film's sole purpose of letting the world know how guilty we all should feel about the holocaust only serves to point up the horrors of the ongoing Israeli occupations in Palestine.I really don't feel that this is a particularly good film besides that.Ben Kingsley is insufferable, Ralph Fiennes hams it up, Liam Neeson sounds like The Count from Sesame Street.Spielberg has stated that he set out to make a memorial to the suffering of his people, and he has done a pretty good job of that. Unfortunately, his undoubted talents lie in the field of fantasy, not reality, and this self-indulgent polemic will not earn him his place in history."

funsterdad,"Apr 25, 2017",10/10,"A fellow reviewer started his review of ""Schindler's List"" almost on the defensive, with an assumption that others might be critical of his determination of this film as one of the greatest, that he would place it ""up there"" (my words) with ""The Godfather"" and ""Citizen Kane.""I'm going to contend that ""Schindler's"" is not only among the greatest, it goes down in historical terms as perhaps one of the most important films ever made. This truth-based story is most compelling, holding this viewer's interest intact throughout for 195 minutes. Liam Neeson does a most incredible job as the hero/anti- hero, Oskar Schindler. A super cast also includes Ralph Fiennes, a perfectly played antagonist, and Ben Kingsley, in the first role following his Oscar-winning performance as Gandhi. It took this viewer quite some time before realizing that the character of Itzhak Stern was indeed played by the masterful Kingsley.The cinematography is key to the story telling, filmed in a crisp black and white to recapture the era and help accentuate the mood. Credit is due Steven Spielberg, as he eventually adds in a few small elements of color which give us hope.The atrocities committed by Nazi Germany against the Jewish race is a history that cannot ever be overlooked and/or forgotten. To that end, ""Schindler's List"" is a very important film that can help generations to come to develop greater empathy for their fellow man. I can't begin to emphasize how important this film should be to any serious film viewer."
aamocho,"Oct 30, 2009",10/10,"This movie fascinated in the sense similar to The Pianist(2002), but the movie forces the viewer to appreciate the beauty of representation of the movie. The scenes in the movie can be offending or heart-shaking, but this is the real quality of a movie that it can successfully urge the viewer to get sentimentally lost inside the movie and the words of appreciation comes out of his mouth. The movie takes a turn at the last hour, that makes one feel the greatness of Oscar Schindler and the exquisiteness of the movie that words of appreciation comes out of his mouth automatically.Regarding the performance I would like to comment that everything from acting to cinematography, from story to direction etc. is fabulous and appreciable. The film is better, in my view, that The Shawshank Redemption(1994), which, in IMDb, is the top rated movie. A must watch!!!"
GodChaser7,"Feb 22, 2014",10/10,"This movie was, in my humble opinion, the greatest movie Steven Spielberg ever created. I have loved most of his movies, but Schindler's List trumps them all for one very important reason: it's a true story that not only tears at the heart strings of any human being with a heart, but it captures a piece of history that is personal to Spielberg himself. I am a major defender of the nation of Israel and a lover of her people. The idea that any man could glean pleasure from destroying any human life is a concept way beyond my grasp, but to feel a race of people is so superior to another that the other is deemed unworthy to live is beyond reason.As you may have guessed, Schindler's List is about the Holocaust. Spielberg brings the stories of a relatively small group of Jewish families who were caught in the middle of the world's greatest tragedy right to your living room. What makes this movie so different from most other Holocaust movies is that you get a first-hand look into what a real life hero is made of. Heroism is not all muscles and brawn. Sometimes all it takes is a broken heart."
asticht,"Mar 11, 2004",N/A,"When I first saw Schindlers list in the theater when it first came out, I was left stunned and emotionally drained. Now with the release of the film on DVD I am still in awe of the precision and accuracy that it portrays of the atrocities committed by the Nazi's during the second world war.  Stephen Spielbergs decision to make the movie entirely in black and white was pure genius and shows why he he is as successful of a director as he is.  This film is such a departure from other films that Spielberg has made and is a testament to his sincere embracing of the storyline and content of the story.  While this film is long by most standards, nearly twice as long as most contemporary films, it does not drag and keeps the audience rapt attention.  It is the type of film which comes along once in a great while which truly captures the imagination of the audience.  The subject matter makes this film one which one truly cannot express as an enjoyable film, but on a higher level it is insightful and inspires one to really see how one person can truly change the world, at least their part of the world.  Oskar Schindler was a scheming war profiteer who had no interest in any part of world politics, the winds of war were blowing in his direction and he took full advantage of it.  As the war progressed and he became a witness to the horrific acts committed by the Nazi's against the Jews he became to see the Jews in a different light to what the political propaganda was saying and he developed a conscience which ultimately led him to expend vast sums of money in bribes and political favors to protect his workers in his factory, initially under the guise of needing to keep trained workers in his factory to maintain production, but eventually because he could see how his workers people were being made to suffer and were being brutally murdered simply because of a misguided political doctrine.  Acting in this movie is superb, Lliam Neeson was nominated for best actor for his portrayal of Oskar Schindler and ultimately lost the award to Tom Hanks portrayal of a dying HIV positive lawyer in Philadelphia, this was truly one of those times when the Academy had a very difficult decision to make as both actors justifiably deserved the award.  Ralph Fiennes was nominated as best supporting actor for his role as the homicidal concentration camp Kommindant Amon Goeth, he ultimately lost the award to Tommy Lee Jones for his work in the Fugitive. Surprisingly one actor who did not receive a nomination, but should have would be Ben Kingsley who deservedly could easily have won the award for his portrayal of Jewish accountant Itzhak Stern who cooperated and assisted Oskar Schindler in running his Enamelware factory and ultimately used his intelligence to manipulate the system to encompass as many unskilled laborers as possible into Schindlers factory, persons who otherwise would have gone to the death camps as they were primarily musicians, writers and teachers, all who were considered high priority execution material by the Nazi regime.  This is a truly remarkable, emotional and moving film that will easily stand the test of time and remain a classic for years to come, it would be highly recommended and should be mandatory viewing material for all high school aged students who wish to graduate, as this film is not just a depiction of the events of World War II, but is also a reflection of the inner monster that lives within all mankind, hatred, and how there also lives within us a capacity to do great good for our fellow man."
Cal-5,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"The words ""The Greatest Film Ever"" hardly describes Steven Spielberg's masterpiece about the Holocaust during World War II. This by far is Spielberg's crowning achievement. Schindler's List is, also, the most beautifully photographed film ever. It's black-and-white cinematography adds to the film's unreal authenticity. Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley add three of the greatest film performances ever. This is a film that everyone should watch."
moonspinner55,"Jul 1, 2007",7/10,"Holocaust drama from director Steven Spielberg, with an intense, sweeping scope, a brave focus, and also some iconic movie-star gloss, with Liam Neeson lit up and photographed à la Humphrey Bogart in ""Casablanca"". Despite this formulaic style, Neeson is very good playing Oskar Schindler, a decadent member of the Nazi party who nevertheless was a reluctant savior to some 1,100 Jews during WWII when he employed them in his factory, saving them from certain death in Hitler's concentration camps. Spielberg won a Best Director Oscar for the film, and he gets terrific supporting performances from Ben Kingsley, Embeth Davidtz, and most especially Ralph Fiennes as a despicable Nazi commandant. Some of the human terror depicted is frighteningly real, and even though the last act smacks of Hollywood grand-standing, the movie has unlimited power. Winner of seven Oscars in all, including Best Picture. *** from ****"

colewaters,"Jun 7, 2016",N/A,"Schindler's List is not only a pure masterpiece but, for me, it is one of the greatest films ever made in the world.The film starts off to reveal a womanizing, Nazi business man who profited off of slave labor. The Nazi business man is of course Oskar Schindler. Oskar is just like most men. He has a love for good wine, beautiful women, and pursues happiness through the success of his business. But on his journey to a successful business, millions of Jews were being killed during a time which most label as one of the darkest periods of human history. As Oskar made money, innocent people were being murdered. That's when the self-centered, often money hungry Oskar steps in and gives up his goal of having a successful business to save the lives of over 1,000 Jews.This film is about redemption and was beautifully photographed in black and white by Janusz Kaminski (cinematographer). At the helm is no one other than Steven Spielberg, who brilliantly called non-pretentious shots and brought back to life a time and period most want to forget, but shouldn't.

Digory,"Aug 27, 2012",10/10,"1993 was a great year for Steven Spielberg. Just after the release Jurassic Park, he followed with Schindler's List.I'm not a huge sucker for biographical movies, preferring sci-fi and fictional in general but once in a while there are a few instance where biographical films catch my attention. It's been around for a while and I've heard great things about the movie, not to mention the awards and making it to movie lists. It was only until I found a copy of the film in a video store that I considered to finally watch it.As with biographical films, I was prepared for a slow-paced movie that might bore me. With a 3-hour running time, I felt it was going to exhaust me by the end of the movie. It was not the case, however.I've read of how bad the concentration camps are but how they are depicted in this film was far worse to how I imagined them. There's a sense of despair throughout the movie but Schindler's display of selflessness and humanity showed me the power of kindness in the midst of evil.Acting was great all throughout. I was fascinated with the black- and-white approach but I do understand that it was a way of making the violence a bit tolerable.Having seen it I can really say this is classic that deserves the praise it got. This movie showed me, on both extremes, the tendency of good and evil men. A powerful movie that should not be missed."
amyedwards-1,"Jun 19, 2007",9/10,"When I first saw that Spielberg was behind the movie, I had my doubts since his earlier work doesn't really fall into this category, but I held faith and I have not been disappointed! From the beginning it is such a powerful and moving film and it brought tears to my eyes more then once. It is completely set in Black & White, except for the Red Coat Girl which is pure genius, since it really helps develop the time period it was portrayed in.The Actors too were completely fantastic! Every single actor and extra seemed to be doing their very best and really lived their roles, especially Ralph Fiennes, who was brilliant as the twisted Nazi Amon Goeth. Not just anyone could make that character real and get away with it. All of the characters in the film have depth and substance and the best thing was that you actually see a few of the Jewish people throughout the entire film so we can sympathize with their tale more.It's a film to watch if you enjoy depth and meaning. 9 Stars, Excellent Film!"

tink-1,"Dec 10, 2002",6/10,"Warning, I am one of those Jewish people who has never been so offended in my life. This film shows that Speilberg cares only about likeable characters and whimsy. What a copout! Jews in this film are only shown as rambling ethnicities in tableau shots.Speilberg would rather take a German Gentile, ficitonalize his story (that speech he gives at the end as Schindler is about to leave and Stein gives him the ring was made up, it is historically incorrect and totally made up) and make a movie about the Holocaust from that point of view. My grandmother, who was a Holocaust survivior, walked out in tears from the theatre claiming his film was all lies.Spielberg makes lovely shots, just beautifully photographed, of violence. This is suppose to make us feel the pain, to feel the irony and all it really does is fetishize violence.  We don't learn anything about the jews in this film so it doesn't even hurt that much.Historically incorrect, Speilberg has the nerve to send the Jews to Auschwitz until Schindler can fix the mistake. UM excuse me by the time Schindler had a list, Auschwitz was practically empty and was no longer gassing bodies. If you want a real look at the holocaust, look at the footage actual nazi soldiers shot in the camps. Or read books by the surviovors. Don't watch Schindlers List because all you will get is a redemption story, designed to make us feel as if we too, like Schindler, would save the Jews. It's embarrassing and inaccurate. How dare Spielberg bastardize the pain my heritage, my family, and other Jewish families went through, make it historically inaccurate and then give it to schools around the country? Yep, thats cool."

44lucas,"Oct 20, 1999",9/10,"First I have to say that being born in Poland, I knew about holocaust since before I was 10. I guess only in Israel people are more aware of it. It is a very sensitive topic, and making a movie about how millions of people were exterminated in death camps seems like trivialising the topic. On the other hand criticizing the movie for it's factual faults is even more slippery nontheless. The movie itself is very good indeed, with great acting, memorable scenes, and overall very impressive. I remember that when the end credits started rolling people in the theater were very quiet, and didn't move. Many were shocked by the realism of this movie. It surely is one of the greatest movies ever, but Steven Spielberg intended it to be much more than just a movie. This is where I stop admiring his work.Many will take this film's version of history as a fact. I'm talking about the way Poles were shown in SL. Mr. Spielberg presents us as hateful antisemitic creatures, and he does it so convincingly that if I didn't know any better I would surely believe it. The second issue is the gas chamber scene - in reality, none of the people who would enter the so called ""shower room"" would survive. And as for Oskar Schindler - he didn't consider himself as a man on the mission, not concerned about his profits at all. To sum it off - If you didn't see this movie, go see it.But don't stop there, find some real live accounts of holocaust survivors."

Anonymous_Maxine,"Apr 2, 2002",10/10,"Steven Spielberg's epic portrayal of the Nazi Holocaust is one of the most powerful films ever brought to the big screen. During production, Spielberg is said to have stood in the cold on location in Austria and cried, being partly Jewish, as he imagined the horrors that all of those people suffered during the second World War under the oppression of the Nazis. It is clear that at least some of this emotion transferred over into the film, and the end result is startlingly effective and moving. Sure, Spielberg has had several other films that have been amazing and memorable, not the least of which, obviously, are ones like Saving Private Ryan and Amistad (oh shut up, Amistad rocked), but in my opinion, the shocking realism achieved in large part through the documentary style filmmaking gives Schindler's List the boost needed to surpass the also brutally realistic Saving Private Ryan.The story involves a Nazi who exercised his humanity and attempted to free as many Jews as possible from being killed in the concentration camps. Steven Spielberg has been often criticized for being overly sappy or emotional in his films (this was, of course, long before Spielberg himself criticized Roberto Benigni's Life Is Beautiful for virtually the same thing), and this may have happened in Schindler's List as well, but in this case, if he was sappy it was for good reason and with great effect. At the end of the film, Liam Neeson's Oskar Schindler has saved a tremendous amount of people who would otherwise have died, but he doesn't seem to notice this as he emotionally laments all of the possessions that he still has that could have been used to save peoples' lives. This is especially effective because of the fact that he was a much more materialistic opportunist at the beginning of the film before he began to pay attention to his conscience.As he did with Saving Private Ryan, Spielberg creates a film with Schindler's List that is absolutely unflinching. He does not shy away from the horrific things that happened to the victims in the concentration camps, and he does not sugar-coat his presentation of it at all. The time period is re-created and brought to the screen with stunning and disturbing realism, and if it weren't for the quality of the presentation, it could almost seem that we are watching stock footage of the concentration camps themselves rather than a scripted and edited film.Spielberg's emphasis on the emotional element of his films comes into play most powerfully in the closing scene of the film, as a very long line of people  the descendents of those that he saved during the war  walk through a cemetery in the modern day and place flowers on his grave. Schindler was unsatisfied when the war ended because he felt that he could have, and should have, saved more people, but during this scene it becomes abundantly clear that he really made a difference, and that his accomplishments were important and long-lasting.With Schindler's List, Steven Spielberg once again demonstrates his tremendous skills as a filmmaker. 1993 is a testament to Spielberg's filmmaking skills, because this was the year that he directed Schindler's List, the Best Picture of the year, as well as Jurassic Park, which was the most popular film of the year. These two films are a perfect example of the two main types of films that Spielberg is so adept at creating. There are the fun and exciting films, like Jurassic Park, E.T., Hook, the Indiana Jones films, and the more recent A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and then there are the films that are historically accurate and are made to deliver powerful messages to the world in reference to the events portrayed in the film, such as Amistad, Saving Private Ryan and, probably his most powerful yet, Schindler's List."

Scarletfire-1,"Jul 4, 2006",3/10,"I found this movie to be very boring. Not sure what people could possibly see in it. I went with some friends who wanted to see it the 1st day it was released in the theaters. The whole first hour was just about this guy setting up a pots and pans factory. I was ready to just walk out at that point, but my friends wanted to stay so I was stuck there watching the rest of this.I've seen many documentaries on A&E, History Channel, etc on the holocaust and I guess I just presumed that everyone else had too. Apparently a lot of people never have, never read about it in school or anything either. After it was over, these people in the theater were all sitting there like they were stunned or something. Like they just had no idea that stuff like that happened during WWII. I was thinking to myself ""lets just get the heck out of here"".If you never get drawn into a movie at the beginning, it can sometimes be too late - no matter if it gets better later on you can just lose any interest in it."

ctorchia,"Apr 15, 2016",10/10,"Schindler's ListWhen we think of the holocaust we think of Hitler, Jews, and for some, Oskar Schindler. Steven Spielberg took an absolute horror and showed us how there was still good in man. The movie is an excellent tear jerker and at some times send shivers down your back due to the gruesome inhumanity that was shone. The movie was fantastically crafted to show us the horrors of the holocaust and really toy with our emotions.For instance, Spielberg's use of color during a black and white film was fantastic and brilliantly thought out. For example, the scene of the of the little girl with the red coat was so incredibly sad and shows us how utterly atrocious it really was that they would have killed a little girl as such. Spielberg had such a way with making the viewer feel a certain way in the film with his use of all special effects, it was fantastic! When it comes to the acting side of the film I have nothing bad to say what so ever. Liam Neeson, usually portrayed as a killer in his other films, found his soft side and acted as Schindler brilliantly. His voice change and overall talent throughout the film made it such a better film. Not to mention all of the supporting roles such as Amon Goeth (played by Ralph Fiennes) who was an S.S. soldier and how ruthless and emotionless he had to be in some scenes when he killed in order to really get Spielberg's point across. After this film was released in 1993 the world not only remembers how many lives were lost, but how Oskar Schindler risked everything to save twelve hundred Jews and his only regret was that he couldn't save more.

Through the analytical and accurate recounting of the movie I was intrigued to ask questions I never thought I would. Acting of all the actors make you feel the movie, make you want to learn what really happened, make you want to understand why. There are plenty movies based on true stories and I think I have seen enough of them, but none of them had affected me that much. In most cases I would put myself in the main character's shoes and think how I would react in similar conditions. In this case I didn't even bother, I thought I wouldn't manage. What made these feelings though so strong and vivid, were the acting, the directing, the very well done research over historical events, even the idea of shooting the picture B&W I think made more realistic. I hope I will have the chance to watch the movie once more and I wish we will be able to watch movies of equivalent quality in all its aspects.tms"
erikbryngel,"Oct 23, 2002",6/10,"This is one of the most overrated movies ever made. The director has here only used the same tricks as everyone else to awake our feelings. yes, its a very touchy movie but Ive seen it a hundred times.My mark (6) is appreciative of the scenography and the historical value."
ericg-6,"Apr 2, 2003",1/10,"Don't get me wrong, Shindler was a great man who did some amazing things in his efforts to save some Jews from certain death. I just wish Speilberg didn't feel the need to alter an already compelling story. For example, the at the end of the movie...Shindler left with a whole lot of money, which he could probably have used to save even more people, but elected not to. This should not in any way detract from what he did, but it, among other scenes, made the movie a fundamentally dishonest one."
ParaGraph,"Dec 1, 1999",N/A,"This is the best war film about the Holocaust I have ever seen. It depicts the horrors of the Holocaust and war, the tragedy of Jewish nation, and I know, this film could be directed by a Jew, who keeps these horrible times and crimes against humanity in his heart. The tagline says ""Whoever saves one life, saves the world entire"". And this film shows us that no human life can be replaced by another one, and that there is nothing more valuable than HUMAN LIFE. I have not seen a film of such a power in my life. Superbly directed by Steven Spielberg, magnificently photographed in black-and-white by Janusz Kaminski (one of the best directors of photography in modern Hollywood, so to say), perfect performances by Liam Neeson and Ben Kingsley, and, especially, John Williams' beautiful, brilliant score, brings the whole horror and tragedy, cruelty of Nazism, Holocaust and War. This is Spielberg's Triumph. Congratulations!"
amira_berzi,"Aug 29, 2000",9/10,"Cinematography, script, performance, directing... are all elements that have made this film so good to watch.  Of-course the real story is the real notch behind which this is all so moving and amazing.  The thing is that it takes brilliant directing, Spielberg, and performance to be able to reflect this true experience through a movie so smoothly.  The attention to details has contributed to this very successful portrayal of the great pain, degradation and global disaster that took place 50 years ago.  Details such as the nudity scenes of this large number of people that conveys the concept of lack of individuality to a degree implying disrespect and humiliation that is scary.  The components of the characters of Oskar and Stern are very well presented because they are real characters with components of good and bad. Black and white certainly adds to the state of mind the movie puts you in. The idea of masses of people all the time enhances the magnitude of the catastrophe even further."

Kingslaay,"Jan 7, 2018",9/10,"Schindler's List has to be one of the greatest films ever made and it establishes Spielberg at the top of the ladder when it comes to directors.The portrayal and setting of WWII is brutally accurate. Spielberg does not shudder from the harsh cruelties that existed at the time. From various vantage points we watch the horror unfold. A film does not need to build towards something as it starts with such a horrible setting, it was the reality at the time.Oscars transformation from an opportunistic businessman to a heroic saviour is one of the best transformations seen in film.As tough as it is to watch it is a beautifully woven masterpiece by Spielberg and one does not know how much time has passed as he/she has been fully immersed in this dark tale and reality.9/10"
ToldYaSo,"Aug 3, 1999",10/10,"I don't have to tell you that ""Schindler's List"" is an extraordinary and important film. Unanimous praise and celebration of a multi-award winning cinematic masterpiece should make it abundantly clear what a powerful film it is. To say nothing of Steven Spielberg's remarkable achievement of delivering in the same year the greatest box office hit to date with ""Jurassic Park"" and then the Academy's best picture and director Oscars. But everyone knows about that already.I saw this film at a second run cinema in my neighbourhood, which basically sold out each show of ""Schindler's List"" for the week it was running. When my wife and I entered the theater, there seemed to be only one pair of seats available in the whole place. Only after we sat down did we notice the guy in front of us was proudly brandishing a tall cowboy hat. We figured out quite quickly why our seats were available and thought we ought to explore our options. I very politely leaned forward and asked him if he was going to wear the hat during the show. With a friendly smile, the kind man in his mid-thirties assured us he'd remove it when the picture began. True to his word, he took off the hat when the lights went out.Rarely have I ever seen a theater audience so transfixed on the images before them. Complete devotion of attention from every patron. Except one. When the ""dude"" in front of us grew tired of the film, some twenty minutes into it, he attempted making out with his girlfriend who briefly complied but ultimately succeeded in pushing him away. A number of future attempts were met with decreasing levels of success. Clearly the subject matter on screen was far from romantic.Weeks later, art imitated life on an episode of ""Seinfeld"" when Jerry's friends and family are outraged at his similar behavior which was a result of having no privacy while his parents stayed with him.Back to our friend ""Howdy Doody"", who has failed in his amorous advances during a film about one of the most chilling, harrowing subjects in the history of mankind. When his attention span gave out, and I imagine some five year olds could put him to shame, he rested his head on the back of the seat and stared at the ceiling. He would periodically sigh loudly, a declaration of his utter boredom. Not surprisingly, he drifted away and soon began to snore.I did nothing of course, and resigned myself to the fact that I'd have to watch the film again. This unfortunate sort of thing is the downside of seeing films in the theater, which I am by and large a huge supporter of in general. You never know what ""Buckaroo"" you might be sitting behind, but my advice to you is simple. If you ever spot a cowboy hat, relocate."
celebgirl,"Feb 3, 2000",9/10,"Even though this may not be my favorite film, it has to be the best made movie I have ever seen, in terms of cinematography. Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes did an impeccable acting job, and Steven Spielberg triumphed."
taryllsbaker,"May 9, 2017",8/10,"Schindler's List is directed by Steven Spielberg and stars Liam Neeson, Ralph Fiennes, Ben Kingsley, Caroline Goodall, Jonathan Sagalle and Embeth Davidtz.In German-occupied Poland during World War II, Oskar Schindler gradually becomes concerned for his Jewish workforce after witnessing their persecution by the Nazi Germans.Steven Spielberg's horrifically harrowing Schindler's List isn't just a critically acclaimed, award-winning masterpiece. This is a documentary of real life events, a truly terrifying picture which chronicles The Holocaust, within the most destructive period of our time. A time that must never be repeated. Captured masterfully in black-and-white celluloid with hand-held cameras, Schindler's List follows Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a German industrialist who begins to feel concerned for his Jewish workforce, leading to an emotionally captivating story that evolves continuously as Steven Zaillian's beautiful screenplay culminates to one of Schindler's final heartbreaking lines: ""I could have got more out. I could have got more. I don't know. If I'd just I could have got more.""Liam Neeson showcases a raw talent as Schindler, performing skilfully throughout. Every line is delivered with absolute care and feels entirely realistic. His interactions with Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) are some of the greater scenes in the film, most specifically the creation of the list. Kingsley has always proved himself an incredible supporting act. Ralph Fiennes also plays alongside Neeson as Amon Goeth, a ruthless and negligent SS captain who murders for sport. Eventually, Goeth is told that power is in fact to never kill, but pardon a man. It never truly connects with him, but continues his work with it in mind. This is one of Fiennes' greatest, most pre-eminent performances to date.The decision to shoot the film in black-and-white only catapults the 'documentary tone' that Spielberg sets out to achieve, and in doing so creates an eerie experience for viewers. There's one scene in particular that uses colour for a little girl's red coat, as she stumbles through a disturbing site of bloody murder whilst Schindler keeps a close eye. This scene essentially serves as the brutal realisation for Schindler, and becomes one of the most iconic scenes in film history. A simply breathtaking use of colour within a black-and-white picture. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski expresses his enduring adroitness with excellent execution.John Williams' haunting score captures the horrors of war as violinist Itzhak Perlman performs every single note with intricate skill. The main theme is pleasing to the ears but when paired with Spielberg's picture, it's painfully distressing, traumatic, even disturbing. 'Jewish Town' continues that same feeling, but explores Williams & Perlman's impeccable talent further. This is a fine example of the perfect film score.Verdict; It may be a tough subject and a difficult experience to bear, but Schindler's List is a film to be seen by all.Schindler's List – ★★★★ (8/10)"
MuviFan73,"May 25, 2017",9/10,"Oskar Schindler, when someone judges him at first time may think of him as a moody business man who most important aim is money. His moody nature takes his contacts made, with higher authorities and women. Now this man does the work of saving 1,100 lives.From where I see, he has done a Godly act by saving lives. He sacrifices all of his earned wealth in rescuing Jews and still at end regrets the money he used as bribe for growth of his industry, could have saved more lives.At last I want to just say his moody nature is nothing, in front of lives he saved."

Do yourself a favor and watch the whole movie please before you're rating."
jimbo-53-186511,"Nov 17, 2013",7/10,"Schindler's list tells the story of Oskar Schindler (Neeson)who is a Nazi businessman who decides to open a factory that employs 'skilled' Jewish workers to make pots and pans (as well as other metal products). He then trades these goods and ends up making an awful lot of money. He employs Itzhak Stern (Kingsley)as his accountant and ultimately his 'right hand man'. Whilst he is clearly exploiting his workers, they don't mind as they would rather work for Schindler than be under the brutal regime of the SS. When Schindler's workforce are taken from him by the evil general Amon Goeth (Fiennes) and when he witnesses the horrors of how Goeth and his men are treating them, Schindler decides to take action and tries to save as many of those that are being persecuted as possible.If I was to judge this film on a technical basis only then it would get a 10 for me; the directing, the cinematography, the acting were all perfect in my book. I also liked that it was filmed in black and white as this helped to not only capture the 'bleakness' of the Holocaust, but it also helped in getting a feel for the era. I also liked how the era had been recaptured and created - it certainly had an authentic feel to it. Finally we come to the acting and for me it was Fiennes that shone as the evil General Amon Goeth - he was really creepy and absolutely personified evil. Neeson and Kingsley were great too, but for me Fiennes put on the best performance.So having said all that, you might be wondering why I'm only rating this 7/10? Well for me, it is technically perfect, but Schindler's list (at well over 3 hours long was far too long in my opinion). The first hour was brilliant and the last 30-45 minutes were also very good. It was the middle part of the film that dragged for me. I personally felt that 2 1/2 hours max would have been sufficient, but at 3 hours and 15 minutes it was just ridiculous.Having said that this is still a film that everyone should watch. It's not an easy watch at times, but it's still a very important film. As a side note, the end of the film is probably one of the most 'moving' and 'touching' moments I've ever experienced when watching a film. Great film - but a tad too long in my opinion."

onurkara1212,"Apr 1, 2018",10/10,"This movie is great, it potrays the harsh environment of nazi Germany with great detail and while lots of people seem to disagree gives us an intriguing protagonist as at first he only cared for his business and slowly had a change of heart.There is only one problem with this movie in my opinion, and that is that it drags from time to time. The thing is every scene is interesting but is kind of like a paper you have to write for uni or school and it has a word count you can't exceed even if everything you have written is relevant some of it still needs to be cut out, and the same goes for this movie, some scenes should be cut out even though there was no one scene that stood out as unnecessary.So 9/10, one thing I must say is that when checking actual reviews here I'm surprised it has the 8.9/10 rating since the majority has been 1/10 reviews."

88L71,"Sep 10, 2001",7/10,"This is a good movie indeed, one of those which make you think. The simple fact of being a Spielberg film warned me not to take it too seriously, after all he's always that dream embodier we all knew in his classics... touching little aliens, dire tough sharks, smart dinosaurs brought back to life and so on. Even here we have a stunning portrait of the evil (R.Fiennes really deserved the oscar he didn't get) but the real Amon Goeth had not a home on a hill as we can see, and he was arrested in September 44 by SS, then captured by americans and executed on Sept 46. All in this movie is clearly intended to make you feel dizzy and touched, this is of course not shifty, everyone knows this is a tear-jerker but what everyone seems to ignore is that you need some subterfuges when you aim to involve deeply someone in a story, and Spielberg knows how to do it, he knows it well, he is a master. So, here are the expected germans, shown as either monsters or homicidal robots; a bunch of events of which only the grotesque aspect is fully portrayed and most of all a movie that openly focalize only on jews, giving the impression (the same we get at school) that they are the greatest (or more important) victims of that period, think about people of the former USSR before answering ""well...isn't it?"". I said it makes you think, personally i had to think when i saw all the comments here in the IMDb about this film, seems people simply accept it without any reservation and with tears in their eyes... the power of being Steven Spielberg! And, most of all, the power of talking about Holocaust! I'm not a negationist, even though i don't accept blindly the classic version of history, and i'm definitely not a nazi-sympathizing, but i don't like hypocrisy and all forms of mass-conditioning, ""books say..."" ""Spielberg says..."" and everytime an hysterical and irrational commotion. That was a complicate period, you can't understand it reading a single book or watching a movie, anyway, everyone plays the wiseacre and gives his sentence. After all, i give a good 9/10 for film making, good acting, good directing, good soundtrack, good all; and 5/10 for pretentious politically correct intentions, a nice arithmetical 7/10 and life goes on."
cjwynes,"Sep 6, 2001",2/10,"OK, I really don't like this film.  So I'll start with the positives.  That would be Ben Kingsley....ok, I guess that's it.First of all, there's the obvious fact that Spielberg was gunning for the Oscar on this one.  He picked an issue that was popular in the politically correct world of Oscar voters, one that nobody can remedy or do anything about but they all like to discuss to show how much they care, and ran with it.  The full weight of the concentration camp massacres can only really be seen in that French documentary (the name eludes me.)  And if you want to get a feel for life in Nazi Germany, you might as well watch the propaganda film ""Triumph of the Will,"" giving the viewer a chilling glimpse at the culture of national socialism.Spielberg's attempts to be ""artsie"" are incredibly phony, particularly the ""red dress girl""'s presence in a B&W film.  An Liam Neeson simply does not pull off his part.  At the film's end, you REALLY want to sympathize with Schindler when he laments that he could have saved ""one more,"" but Neeson's performance in that critical scene is unconvincing.  He plays the cold and reserved parts of Schindler's character so strongly that the character development leading to that emotional climax is lost.People rate this film highly because they feel that they're supposed to. Don't take their word.  The film (with Kingsley as the exception) is poorly acted, drawn out, and pretentious.  If you've been fortunate enough to miss this film so far, keep up the good work."
Willard1975,"Jan 5, 2002",N/A,"I have to say this movie is one of those who have really touched me deeply. Imagine thousands of people being ""slaughtered"" because:1. Their beliefs were/are different than others. 2. They had plenty of fortune. 3. They ""looked"" different. (Did they?).Sounds stupid doesn't it?Then imagine that all of this has actually happened for real, and that the reasons were among those that i have mentioned.It is a horrible movie, but yet a masterpiece that we need to see to be reminded so that this does never happen again. I truly admire Oscar Schindler for what he did.This is Spielbergs best movie ever, and he will probably never make a better one."
skepticrunner-912-349677,"Feb 1, 2014",9/10,"Short & sweet: It's Realistic. It's Heart-wrenching. It's dramatic.
It's honest. It connects you to the protagonist's character.When Oskar exclaims in misery that he could've helped more, could've
done more, looks at the ring on his finger, and almost falls the the
ground, it makes you cry. You wish you could've yourself done more,
even though you weren't there. Liam Neeson is amazing in this movie. I
don't cry often. Yet, this movie takes you through such a story, and
makes you imagine yourself in this time and place, wishing you could do
more. I like when a drama still has enough suspense combined with plot,
character development, that it pulls at you from several angles. This
is well- thought out and remains at the top of my list today."
White Dolphin,"Jan 14, 2001",10/10,"How people can call this movie 'horrible' or rate it with 1 star is really beyond me. If ever a movie has captured the cruelty and inhumanity of the holocaust this is it. Horrifying scenes such as a woman being shot to death for construction mistakes that weren't her fault, a man taken out to be killed but the gun won't fire and has to hear the officer try to see what the problem is so that he can shoot. And so many many more scenes that will stay in your mind for a long long time.I didn't cry in this movie. I haven't cried in a movie since I was a kid. But this movie had a huge impact on me that when I went to sleep the night I saw this movie the images kept rolling in my mind (quite like the impact the botched execution scene in The Green Mile had on me).I saw a review before me (a few pages back) which said that Israeli people are probably the most aware about the Holocaust. But I don't believe that's true. At least not to the younger generation. One of the huge mistake people make (including many many Israelis) is that the Holocaust was only against Jews. I personally find it a disgrace that the Holocaust Memorial Day in Israel and the famed Holocaust Museum in Israel ""Yad Va Shem"" refer only to the figure 6,000,000. When over 11,000,000 people fell victim to the crimes of the Nazis. But hey I'm rambling here. I think this movie definitely captures the torture that the Holocaust victims had to go through.The movie is in black and white, with only one girl in a red dress who is shown trying to save her life from the Nazis by hiding under a bed. We later see this same girl's body taken to be burned- showing us that she obviously didn't survive. That got to me most. I don't think much of Steven Spielberg as a person. In fact I don't even think that much of him as a director but he did a magnificent job on this movie. I'm, sure that it will become one of the most well remembered movies of all time. People know the figures, the numbers, the years but to see it for yourself just makes you feel so happy that you were not a Jew/Gypsy/Black/Homosexual/Deformed/Handicaped/Left-Handed/Communist, etc. at that time. I think everyone should see this movie.Although I think it is the most powerful movie ever made, and deserves the number one spot on the IMDb top 250 (over The Godfather, and The Shawshank Redemption) it's not a movie I would see multiple times. Perhaps once a year when it's shown on Holocaust Memorial Day, and even that can be to much. It's the type of movie that it's enough to see once and sticks in your mind. 10/10."
Samiam3,"May 15, 2010",10/10,"Oskar Schindler was a German Entrepreneur who came to Poland during the Nazi occupation to start a new business. He wanted to hire Jewish labor because they were cheaper than Polish. For a while, a good number of Jews went to work in Schinder's factories, making pots and pans for the German economy. Eventually they were rounded up by Nazi Comander Amon Goeth and put in the concentration camps. Those who were not fit to do back- breaking slave labor were put in the gas chamber. Oscar Schinder, who was in fact a Nazi supporter, slowly became empathetic after watching the cruelty to these harmless people. Using all the money he made from the business, he purchased 1,100 Jews from the Nazis, and put them back to work in his factory, under good conditions until the war was over. Not long after the war ended, Amon Goeth was executed for his crimes against humanity, and Schindler unfortunately never ran a successful business again, but today the descendants of the Jews he saved number, tens of thousands.He has become a fairly controversial figure, but I personally think that Oskar Schindler was great hero of the 20th Century, and this is one of the greatest American films of all time; absolutely heartbreaking, cinematically epic, and flawlessly acted. Many thanks to both Schindler and Spielberg."
nsganapathy,"Jan 3, 2016",10/10,"Exceptional!! Schindler's list is perhaps the best and most heartbreaking depiction of the Holocaust ever, It's a dark and heart breaking tale of one man's journey to become a hero to the Jew's of today, Liam Neeson plays Oskar Schindler a greedy factory owner who hires Jew's to minimum wage work for him. Soon enough he has all the money in the world and is happy as can be. Or so it appears, as the film progress you see the demeanor and attitude of Schindler change dramatically when he watches the Jewish people get slaughtered like animals by the Nazi's, after that he sets his heart on the sole task if getting them out of the camps and into his country. Schindler's List is the proved example of human kindness and compassion, It's a movie that will make your heart break and make the spirit soar at his heroic feet. Schindler's List is one of the greatest films ever made and will continue to shock and amaze people for all time. I very highly recommend this movie!"
wvriend,"May 1, 2014",10/10,"Showing the monstrosities of war as performed and underwent by normal people in special situations. No specific stereotype good and bad guys. No romantic feeling left regarding war after seeing this masterpiece of human tragedy. Instead of films like, The Piano where the world consists of clearly good or German (stereotype dumb, cruel), Schindler's List shows people who are trapped in war and loose their way. Whether because they are being persecuted, part of the German army or civilians who try to survive. Schindler's List doesn't judge and doesn't need to. A fairly straight account is given from the live and thoughts of the main characters. Emotional stress is sometimes evoked by shots in black- and-white: no overacting needed. Just sit down with your kids and get a real picture of human tragedy at the 2nd world war as took place in Eastern Europe."
michmartimdb-993-673811,"Jun 6, 2014",9/10,"This is the best movie about war I've ever seen! I think the best thing about it is the dark atmosphere, which is created by the deliberate use of no colours (except the ending when it fits). So this movie nearly feels like the original recordings, except with a higher quality and of course less brutal (especially when you think about the LEAN Jews in this time).It's a very tragedy movie, which produces one important question: How much is a human worth? When you don't like this movie you seem to be impatient, unemotional or nearly a neo-Nazi...Schindler's List is a classic, which has many very positive reviews, so I think I have nothing else to add.9/10"
j30bell,"Dec 20, 2004",7/10,"""Gawd bless you mister Schindler"", is one of the few phrases not to appear in Schindler's list, which is useful in that it enables us to distinguish it from a Frank Capra film. Well, to be fair, the phrase ""Shoot her now, on my authority"" isn't in It's a Wonderful Life either.Schindler's List - the story of a war profiteer who saves the lives of over a thousand Jews from Krakow Ghetto during WWII - is one of the Sacred Cows of modern cinema. This is partly because of its subject matter, the excellent performances of the three lead actors, and the epic length and flashy direction of Stephen - ooh what a long film I'm making (it's in black and white y'know) - Spielberg.Schindler's List is a good film, and there are some performances of real note. Kingsley reprises his role as Gandhi and Fiennes and Neeson look fab in black and white. There is also nice mutual tension and understanding between Schindler and Goeth, which makes their scenes together really watchable.Having said all that, the film can be really infuriating.Why, for instance, does Spielberg try to blur the film/history distinction by shooting it in black and white and having real holocaust survivors turn up at the end? Does the film really need this kind of ""legitimacy"" for audiences to take it seriously?And where are the Jewish characters? I can almost hear Spielberg with his screenwriters... ""Woody, hi, I'd like you to do Schindler and Goeth"". ""Ah, but, you know, like, that sounds great! But what about the Jews huh - I think I could do really good job with some of the Jewish Characters"" Woody Allen replies. ""Yeah, hear what you say Woody, but I've promised that to my old buddy George Lucas - he's getting in some practice for a project he's working on called the Yellow Peril, or the Phantom Menace or something"". One review of Schindler's List describes Stern as ""Schindler's conscience"" and that's just about it. Spielberg has outsourced his casting for Jewish characters to Jimny Cricket, which is a real shame because, apart from anything else, it denies them their humanity.In fact, you don't have to be a particularly attentive viewer to see Spielberg's less-than-light touch all over this film. You get the sophisticated monster cliché, with the Stormtrooper playing Mozart (suspiciously well) on an old upright piano during the liquidation of the Krakow Ghetto. You get the violent guard cooing over a Jewish baby ""Ein kind, ein kind!"" You get the Goeth proving how evil he is by hitting his maid. And, of course, you get that ridiculously over-sentimental ending where Schindler makes his final transition to Avatar of the Almighty.Then there's the death. Young girls and boys are killed, women are killed, old folk kick it - I wouldn't be surprised if the tragic death of a young girl's fluffy rabbit only just made the cutting room floor. But, you know, I struggle to remember any adult Jewish man between 18 and 60 killed on camera. Did these deaths not count? David Irving would be delighted.However the holocaust has been used subsequently, it remains one of the most significant and tragic events in European history. It deserved a great film treatment and it nearly got it. Tragically, though he got great performances from his cast and had one of the best stories going, Spielberg was unable to forget he was the same director that brought us ET and Close Encounters. Surely the point about Schindler's story is that, however bad a person is, and however black the times are, everyone has a responsibility to do good when the world is going bad. The danger of this film is that the MTV generation might regard it as a clarion call for inaction  there'll always be a saint like Oscar Schindler along to do the good work for you. 7/10."
Servo-11,"Oct 31, 2002",3/10,"I have lost my enthusiasm for any Steven Spielberg movies over the past several years, ever since he made the switch from good entertainment to preachy message movies showing people all angsty and heartfelt and noble, emotions which he approaches with all the subtlety of Gallagher and his Sledge-o-matic.  Spielberg's films are now more like the corny ramblings of grandpa in his dotage where good people are really good and bad people are bad and even people who are in that grey zone are given a black or white role in the end.  It's all quite tedious to watch.It took me a long time to finally get through Schindler's List, as it did Saving Private Ryan, because I was all too aware the entire time that I was being manipulated -- what to feel and when to feel it.  Some reviewer put it best when he likened Spielberg to the Wizard of Oz, hiding behind a curtain and pushing buttons and pulling switches on people's emotions.  Then he is hailed as an artist and a genius when it's all gross manipulation.Liam Neeson did give a good performance.  His character had more depth to explore than Ralph Fiennes.  Excellent actor Fiennes may be, but he was saddled with a pitifully cardboard character.  Still, I rooted for him until the end.If I want to learn about the Holocaust, I'll watch a documentary and see the facts and have genuine emotions, not be told what to feel.  Jaws, Jurassic Park, and the Indiana Jones movies are plain fun and have the true Spielberg touch, doing what he does best.3/10"
SimonL,"Nov 18, 1998",N/A,"Schindler's List is truly one of the most thought provoking films of the decade. Before seeing this film, I knew nothing about the horrors of the Holocaust, and to be honest, I wish that were still the case.I cannot believe the sheer brutality of the Germans for committing such horrific acts on the Jews. Just because a person has a different religion or race to our own, does that give us any right to crucify them or make them feel less human?With regards to the film, expert performances, especially from Neeson, Kingsley and Feinnes, combined with the superb cinematography of Janusz Kaminski and direction of Spielberg make Schindler's List an enduring, although disturbing, masterpiece."
thinker1691,"Sep 11, 2009",10/10,"Too often the history of the Second World War concentrates on the massive destruction between the countries involved. It is true nearly 25 million people were killed, but the most horrendous tally in human cost was suffered by a single race and they were European Jews. Anyone who Denys this is not only a fool, but a historical moron as well. There is so much irrefutable evidence to disprove them it's simply ludicrous to try. In this film "" Schinder's List "", director Steven Spielberg lays it out cinematically for all to see. The film has so many notable qualities, it's difficult to say which illuminated it the most. The story is based on the real life of humanitarian Oscar Schindler (Liam Neeson) who began the war as a Nazi sympathizer and profiter, but soon realized his Nazi friends were murdering millions, on behalf of the most damnable doctrine ever created. Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley) plays the courageous bookkeeper who not only kept Schindeler's files, but helped him to save the lives of thousands. The heavy, Amon Goeth is played despicably evil by Ralph Fiennes. It is very interesting that during the war, ten of thousands were proud to be Nazi soldiers and SS men, yet after the war, you couldn't find two who would own up to their murderous atrocities. Still the movie has garnered so much acclaim and honor, it has become a tribute to Spielberg and his effort to remember the Hollocaust and the saddest chapter in human history. With no effort at all this has become a Classic in every sense of the word. *****"
BrandonPage,"Jul 8, 2014",10/10,"Excellent filmography, the film just gets better with age and as it progresses. Extremely deep and meaningful and the casting was phenomenal, music choices were great and the overall feel of the film was emotional. There were many great choices made by all parties, being the director and actors as well as the designers. All these parts inside the film made me as an audience member feel as though i was really there experiencing these tragedies. The use of black and white was very powerful and showed how dreadful these things were, the end had a very dense and intense core and I loved it, highly recommended for any fan of this genre."
sartjain-iitk,"May 14, 2014",10/10,"A little slow in the beginning (you'll wonder what's happening), but as the movie progresses it will become awesome. The ending is epic. And considering that this all happened in real makes it even more interesting. Liam Neeson has done an epic role in the movie. Ben Kinsley is also extremely amazing. The movie has been directed in an awesome way by the epic director Steven Spielberg. The movie is black and white in spite of being in the 90's which goes with the movie and has been used well by the director. The movie is a little long (3 hours) but is worth the watch. The Nazi torture has been shown very appropriately."
dakleik,"Jun 2, 2014",9/10,"Excellent film that reflects the controversial situation with the Jewish race during the Holocaust. Highly recommended.It is amazing the way in which the protagonist changes its thinking throughout the film, until end transformed your business in a salvation for members of the breed.All aspects are positive in this film. Actors camera script, etc..I hesitate to rate it the highest rating because surely I let go of the feelings that I produce my viewing of the film, and try to be as objective as possible.But i recommend it for all the people!Very beautiful in all the scenes and thingsI mean, the OST is excellent, actors too...It's very difficult to say something bad about this film, ins't it?"
stidmatt,"Apr 14, 2017",9/10,"The Holocaust is one of the most filmed events in world history, with films being made across the world. I have seen many excellent movies about the Third Reich made in Germany over the last 30 years which nail the feeling of fascism and make you feel a lot of emotions, but most American Third Reich films are really poor, try to make humor, or have ridiculous characters. Humor does not belong in a Holocaust movie. Schindler's List is the only American movie about the Third Reich I have ever seen which is at the same level as German films about the Third Reich. A must watch."
bunny_hater66,"Mar 7, 2008",9/10,"I thought that the film was excellent, I thought it was a brilliantly realisation, fiercely controlled and restraint treatment of a true story, the film had a great atmosphere of a kind of documentary, harsh and compassionate and avoid sentimentality until the end. And felt as though Spielberg escaped the great and family films like E.T and Idiana Jones and was successful. Spielberg also does an uncommonly thing and keeps our attention for 185 mines. What I also liked was the rich black and white cinematography. The music helped move a lot of the scenes. I also liked the acting by Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes. I also feel that the film and the script are well constructed. I also liked the lighting when Schinder is at the party strobing across his eyes hiding the rest of his face. I liked the scene when all of Schindler's female workers were dropped of at the concentration camp, the scene when they were put in the showers, this scene was good but suspenseful with shot reverse shot from the screaming women to the shower heads as they thought that they had been put in the gas chamber. I felt that Spielberg kind of personified the gas chambers as though they were the real killers and the executioner and the Nazi's were just the jury. I also felt that another scene that was key was when Ralph Fiennes was going to kill that man behind the factory for not making enough door hinges and the gun jamming, as later on in the film Liam Neeson discusses with Ben Kingsley about the machinery have found to been faulty and he also made a point that he wants the weapons not to work, also with the scene later on we find out that the man is a Rabbi and so this could be that god was trying to save him, one of the officers said that it was impossible that all of the guns were jamming at the same time which made me think was the rabbi just plain lucky or was he being protected."
elefzonot,"Nov 1, 2003",10/10,"Steven Spielberg directed a lot of the best films in history, such as: E.T,Close Encounters Of The 3rd Kind,Jaws,Jurassic Park,Saving Private Ryan,Poltergeist,The Color Purple,Raiders of the Lost Ark,Minority Report.....and the list just goes on and on....But in my opinion ""Schindler's List"" is the most important masterpiece Spielberg ever made(and it's not because i am israeli..). The acting is breathtaking(especially from Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goeth)and the black & white motive is outstanding... But the real issue here is the true horrible story of the jews in europe of the 1940's.. U can see in this film the true horror and humiliation that the jews had suffered.Truly Spielberg's best work with a very important lesson.. 10/10"
scottmwade-1,"Sep 15, 2007",7/10,Spielberg tends to get a bit overly cheesy in his films and this one is a prime example. Obviously the subject matter is intense and there are a lot of good qualities to the film but the ending was the part that really wrecked it for me and made me roll my eyes back in my head. Another example of an overly cheesed out ending that wrecked an otherwise great film was in Spielberg's 2001 film AI. I thought that was an excellent movie all the way up to the end when it just kept dragging on and on and got totally ridiculous. I don't think the ending on Schindler's List as bad as AI but it was still too much icing and not enough cake.
TxMike,"Dec 12, 2004",N/A,"I'll start with an ""aside."" What is a ""film"" and what is a ""movie."" I take the logical stance most of the time, the crew ""films"" so that the director and editor can create a ""movie"". But I have a difficult time thinking of ""Schindler's List"" as a ""movie."" I didn't watch it to be entertained, no person with a clear vision of the history behind it would. So for me, ""Schindler's List"" is certainly a ""film"", one about a real stain on our human history, a stain placed there solely from religious beliefs. The persecution and attempted extermination of the Jews by the German Nazis.But this ""film"", while its overall subject is the holocaust, is not really about the holocaust. While it revolves around the mistreatment of Jews by the Nazis, it is about the man, Oskar Schindler, played by Liam Neeson. A German, a ""connected"" man in society, he went to Poland and bought a factory, employing cheap Jewish labor, hoping to get rich. He was no humanitarian. But perhaps his biggest weakness, his not being an astute businessman, was responsible for the conversion we see during the course of the three hours running time of the film. He has to rely on a Jew, Itzhak Stern (Ben Kingsley), to run his factory. And the rest, as they say, is history. He changes to the point that he risks his own life to save many, perhaps over 1000, Jews from extermination, no longer for profit but for true humanitarian motives.Unique in this time of modern movie-making, this film is mostly in Black and white. For me this works very well, because first it is such a stark subject and second, there is not so much to distract the viewer from the story. Many consider this Spielberg's best directorial effort, probably because as a Jew it was very personal to him. As a viewer, many times I found it difficult to watch, because the scenes are so realistic. I will never forget the scenes of nude prisoners being marched across the prison grounds to their deaths. I give great credit for this film's place in history, but it is not one that I enjoy watching, it is such a reminder how some can be so cruel to those who should be treated as our brothers and sisters."
rserrano,"Mar 15, 2004",10/10,"What makes this film truly remarkable is the personal transformation which Oskar Schindler under goes just past the mid-point of the movie in a series of incredibly subtle scenes. Early on, Schindler is driven only by selfish desire for money, women and influence. Others may benefit from his actions, but it is purely a by-product. Never does he help someone to his own detriment. He narrowly rescues Itzhak Stern from a train to a death camp and then scolds him, saying ""If I had been five minutes later, then where would I be?"". But by the end of the movie, Schindler willingly loses all his personal wealth and repeatedly risks his life in order to save others. The inflection point takes place at a meeting between Schindler and Stern at the Plaszow work camp. It's night and Oskar leaves a Nazi party to see his accountant. At the end of a brief conversation Stern says "" Don't let things fall apart. I worked too hard for this"". He is pleading with Schindler to take personal responsibility. As Stern walks away a search beacon shines over his shoulder and fills the screen with a blinding white light. The camera cuts to Oskar. He is engulfed by the light. He smiles of deep satisfaction. This sets off an amazing sequence of scenes: - Schindler comes to the aid of a metal presser. - He gives protection in his factory to a traumatised boy, despite the fact that he has no skills. He gives up his own silver lighter and cigarette case to make these two events happen. - He comforts Amon Goeth's abused maid. They sit beneath a cone of white light. At a point where he could easily take advantage of her, instead he helps her renew her will to survive. - In a discussion with Goeth after a party, he explains that true power comes not from control or the ability to kill, but the ability to forgive. This could be further interpreted as ""Success in life comes not from pursuing personal gain, but from rising above it"". Goeth is amused and intrigued by this but in the subsequent tragic ""bath tub stain"" scene, we see that he is pathetically incapable of internalizing anything that was said. - In perhaps the most powerful scene of the film, a women comes to Schindler and begs that he take her skilless, aged parents into his factory to save their lives. He appears from on high at the top of a long stair case. She tells him "" No one ever dies here. It is a haven. They say that you are good"". One can easily substitute the word ""heaven"" for ""haven"" and ""God"" for ""good"". In rage, Schindler throws her out. But then he goes to see Stern. He tells Stern that there is good in all people but that war brings out the worst in them. He uses this to rationalize and forgive the behavior of Goeth. We fully expect that he will now use this to rationalize his own selfish behavior. Instead he takes the watch from his own wrist and gives it to Stern to use to buy the lives of the two elderly parents. The irony is that war has borough out good in Schindler that might never have emerged otherwise. From here on out Schindler performs a continuous series of selfless acts. Moreover,despite the huge personal risks he takes, we feel good about the choices he makes and therefor we are transformed a little bit, along with him."
homer-58,"May 7, 1999",10/10,"What can I say about this movie that will truly honor the masterpiece that it is? Well, to start with, I can say that this is by far the best movie I have ever seen. It stirs up numerous emotions inside me when ever I see it. Spielberg- being a jew himself- has in a remarkable way, managed to re-tell the story of the destiny of the WWII jews. One can almost believe he was there in person and lived through those years in the 40's.Schindler's List works like magic on the screen. Of course the actors, Neeson, Kingsley and Fiennes in particular are tremendous, but what really makes this one the milestone that it is, is the fact that it is shot entirely (except a couple of min. at the very start of it) in black and white. This makes the viewers completely captivated on what's going on on the screen. It's almost as if we are being held in a state of believing we are in the movie ourselves. No other movie I've seen can I say have made me feel that way. Steven Spielberg finally got the reviews and critics he deserved for Schindler's List. He is truly the greatest Director of today. No one can disagree there I think. Make sure you all see this one soon, I promise you a movie so strong, you'll remember it for a long time to come."
yoda-43,"May 11, 1999",10/10,"Schindler's List is one of the reasons I am such a huge film buff. The film depicts the lives of Oscar Schindler and his wife, Ishtak Stern, Amon Goerth, and the survivors of the Holocaust. The movie, to my knowledge, is historically accurate. It touched me in a way that few movies have ever done. My favorite scenes are when Olek has to hide with Danka and the other children in the toilet, when the survivors place the rocks on Oscar's grave, and when Oscar cries ""I could've saved one more. Liam Neeson,Raiff Fiennes, and Ben Kingsley make their best performances, and all deserved Academy Awards. Schindler's List is a must-see for any movie fan."
vijenderk-ca,"Feb 20, 2014",10/10,I bet over here that no matter how hardcore a person can.....but you will cry at the end of this movie. 3 hours of Drama you can't even think of anything else while watching this master stroke by Stevem Spielberg...Lism is like always ..no comments about the man...At last you will find out many different side of a single human being in a very short life.Ralph is still known for his one of the best performance throughout his life for this movie only.Black and white screenplay gives a much better appearance to this amazing script.
grahamsj3,"Feb 12, 2004",9/10,This is a superb true story starring a superb actor in a wonderful production. This film certainly deserves all the accolades it's received and probably then some. Liam Neeson is perfectly cast in this story of a German industrialist who risked everything to save at least a few Jews from the death camps. Outstanding in every way! This is a future classic film and one to buy and keep!
dbborroughs,"Mar 6, 2004",6/10,"To me this story of Schindler is a split personality of a film. On one hand its stark black and white photography and realistic view of life in the ghetto and the camp is a kick in the heart. The problem is what should have been a stark gripping in your face take on the Nazi destruction of those it hated is undercut by a classic MGM 1940's style photography in every other scene. I kept thinking one of the great directors of the period was making this and not Spielberg. To me it has always felt that Spielberg waffled on the subject because he feared what the reaction would be.Its not a bad film, its just not the great one it wants to be."
bernie-122,"Sep 8, 2007",4/10,"I have no trouble agreeing that this is Spielberg's best film. That's not as much of a compliment as you might think, because the majority of them have been embarrassingly awful.Stevie learned a long time ago that there is big money in mawkish sentimentality and set out to capitalize on it. There is a substantial, guaranteed segment of the cinema-going public that will accept schmaltz as art. They simply do not know the difference.So, while I will accept that this is a good movie, there is no way it belongs in the top 250. Or even in the top 2500. There are too many historical inaccuracies, too many factual liberties, too many scenes overdone for deliberate shock value. The whole thing is fake. It is only vaguely based on what actually happened. Yet it is presented as a factual historical drama and has been widely accepted as such.The excesses of Hitler's Germany can never be forgotten or swept under the rug, but embellishing them and making gaudy parodies of the real thing does not well serve the memory of those who suffered through it.""The Pianist"" was not a perfect film, either, but it is a lot better than this one."
CinemaClown,"Jan 6, 2010",N/A,"One of the most essential, powerfully moving & profoundly affecting films to grace the silver screen, Schindler's List is the crowning achievement of Steven Spielberg's remarkable film career that finds the master storyteller at the pinnacle of his artistry, is crafted with extreme care n dedication, and is rightfully acknowledged as one of the most honoured & significant films of all time.There are many films out there that have dealt with the subject of Holocaust in the past but the level of precision, craftsmanship & commitment that Spielberg brings on the screen this time plus the emotional impact this film provides over the course of its runtime is second to none. And even after two decades, Schindler's List remains his most personal, most mature & most accomplished work to date."
emasterslake,"Jun 30, 2006",8/10,"I didn't see this movie till recent. But I've been told it's violent and very well received back in 1993. I'm 17 so it was OK for me to see a movie like this.Anyways Schindler's List takes place during WW2. And those who attended history class would know that Adolf Hitler had total control in most parts of Europe and banned all Jewish activity and removed all the Jewish from their homelands. It was the grimmer moment in the entire Jewish history.A man named Oscar Schindler was a business man and a Nazi. Only he was different from other Nazis. He provides the Jews work at his company only if they have working experience. Schindler in secretly does not kill or torture any Jews. He finds the whole thing wrong in a way. But he doesn't adment it because he's might receive serious consciences if he were to say he likes Jews.He makes sure his Jews aren't killed or sent to the more lethal concentration camps by making a list of hundreds of Jews that he bought with his own money. With that list he could be able to grant their freedom by the time the war is over.This movie is very well made. Spielberg did a great job in recreating this time period. I can see why it was given an Oscar during the 1993 Accadmy Awards. It's also interesting that 3/4s of the movie is shot in Black and White.It's strongly recommended for any Spielberg collection. Just know this movie isn't for everyone. It has swearing, violence, and some strong nudity. It's not for kids so I'd recommend it for ages 16 and up or at least someone mature enough to see a violent movie.It might offend certain Jews or those who are offended by Nazis as well."
rrenati,"Jul 12, 2004",10/10,"I don't know how I waited eleven years to see this film. This was one of the most amazing works of art I have ever seen. The cinematography, the music, the acting are monumental. I can't remember the last time I have felt so touched by a movie. The scene in which Schindler is leaving the camp to flee the allies is emotionally gut wrenching. He is truly a man transformed. The plight of the children in the camps as depicted in the film is particularly awe inspiring. To see them separated from their mothers and while others hid in the toilets was almost too much too bear watching. This movie should be watched by everyone for generations as a reminder of the evil that man can perpetrate on man but that one person can make a difference if they are willing to be ruled by love."
Nea-Hart,"Jul 16, 2006",10/10,"Great movie that really touches one's hart. If you're not moved by this film, you are most likely made out of rock. (Please note the jokingly tone in that sentence:) It's not the script or the theme that carries this movie forward, it's the brilliant performance of the actors/actresses and the unique atmosphere in the black and white world on the screen that rips your heart out and steps on it. The glances, the body language, the tension between the actors... I can't point out exactly what it is with these things that give the movie such credibility, I can only say that it -d-o-e-s. A black and white movie about the Nazi-regime might sound boring, or a bit over the top in being serious and dealing with an important issue, but in this case the director did a great job. It's not boring. It doesn't seem like a documentary, like many films about these events does. Still, knowing that the plot is based on a real story really makes you feel like this film is reality. And that, ladies and gents, is definitely a good thing. Ten out of ten stars from me."
ksirr1,"Sep 3, 2006",10/10,"This film was truly moving.I recommend this film to anybody who enjoys a great war film. Set in World War Two, this movie is an exceptional display of the true nature of war. Although there are gory bits it is a very true account. Another good thing about this film is that it is a true story based on a real person Oskar Schindler who i believe was a war-time hero. To be able to rebel against such a man as Adolf Hitler would take a lot of strength. The scenery in the movie is very fitting to the story and is a large part of the movie. Anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach should see this film. It has a great storyline which will captivate you until the very end. Without giving anything away, this was an excellent film, one of the best ever made! Therefore, I give it a rating of 10/10 :)"
ajaysingh0402,"Aug 18, 2014",9/10,"The Holocaust during World War II forms the backbone of the plot in this highly-acclaimed, heart-touching movie. Oskar Schindler is introduced as an opportunistic and avaricious businessman, who hires Jews as workers merely because they constitute cheap labor. But, soon enough, his greed is subdued by his attachment to them and he plans to save them from Hitler's persecution, even if he has to throw away his hard-earned savings as bribes to the Nazi officers. A very commendable job by the writers makes the character come alive very convincingly. Liam Neeson cannot be given any less credit for portraying the protagonist and Ben Kingsley as Stern adds a cherry to the cake. But, the portrayal of the setup actually used by Nazis to slaughter the Jews, makes the audience shiver with fear and disbelief. The detailing and hard-work put by Spielberg is quite evident in the scene where the Jewish children try to elude the Nazi soldiers by hiding in places inconceivable to any ordinary man. Another such instance is when the Jews are transported in trains, huddled like cattle without enough space to take even a whiff of air.An unbiased judge may opine that there were quite a few instances where the protagonist may have been idealized in order to make the people really adore him. This can be defended by accepting that the real Oskar Schindler acted only as a source of inspiration for the role, and the rest had to be cooked up as per the appetite of the audience. All in all, the movie stands today as a masterpiece made once in a lifetime."
mikel weisser,"May 6, 2002",10/10,"perhaps it's a clue about the sad state of our world, the inevitability of the holocausts of the past and the holocausts yet to come, that a full half of the films rated higher on the imdb top 250 than this monumental movie celebrate violence and war. blood and death are now and have always been the high art of our greedy raging world. we can pray for the future, but peace can only come true if people are willing to see the world through the vision of justice, respect for humanity and willing to sacrifice so others may live. That is why i suggest the visions of Keneally, spielberg and oskar schindler. this movie is so magnificent from here on out all my grades will go down in perspective. 12 oscar noms, 7 wins (including picture and director), a host of other accolades, all amply deserved. there is just so much to admire: the mix of large scale storytelling with countless smaller story arcs (kudos to  Steven Zaillian's oscar winning adapation of keneally's wondrous novel), hundreds of amazing and daring cinematic touches (set design, cinematography, and editing all also picked up statues) dozens upon dozens of bravura performances, monolithic sets with literal casts of thousands, impressive historical accuracy, the list is near endless, a series of beauties rising into ultimate truth: a film with a soul. perhaps the powerful beauty of this film is that spielberg does not put a hollywood polish on the fact that oskar schindler was a comprised man yet capable of tremendous goodness. in some ways this can be seen as spielberg's first mature film and it's entirely appropriate that this was the first time he collected an oscar after 5 noms. the journalist in me wants to document all the details in this well earned victory, but the humanist in me just wants to thanks everyone involved for the fact it exists. whatever else may be wrong with our planet we can still find hope in the fact that men like schindler are remembered and revered and honored in such an celebrated and immensely popular film. if my words can make you see a film or work for peace, let this one be the one, let now be the time."
Theo Robertson,"May 21, 2003",7/10,"I thought SCHINDLER`S LIST was a masterpiece when I first saw it a few years ago and having seen it again a couple of times over the years I find myself admiring it less and less after each subsequent viewing . This is down to my gut feeling that the film sugarcoats many events , especially the eponymous character . Remember the scene at the end where Oskar Schindler gives away his goldnes parteiabzeichen in order to finance the saving of some more lives ? It`s a very touching scene but in reality this badge would have no value , so how is this explained ? Very easily - The holocaust happened but that scene didn`t. And I find the character interaction somewhat cheesy between Schindler and Stern . It`s like Stern`s manipulating Schindler while Schindler is making it clear that he doesn`t need manipulating because he`s going to save as many human lives as possible . It`s like the film is trying to say only someone who is good by nature can benefit humanity , an almost insulting simplification and rose tinted view of human nature . This is why I enjoyed Ralph Fiennes performance as Amon Goeth so much . He`s a Nazi murderer who shoots woman and kids , but Fiennes plays him not as an inhuman goose stepping monster but as an all too flawed human one ."
jaime_dvette,"Jan 22, 2004",N/A,"Everyone knows the importance of this film. Some of the moods and feelings that this movie produces cannot even be put into words. But perhaps the most important thing I've seen this movie produce was in the person of Byron Smith. Byron was a Lieutenant in USA's neo-nazi movement. He was your typical tatooed skinhead. I met him during a prison visit where I was doing volunteer work. I have met many of these people and he was the most devoted and intense. He watched Schindler's List to prove to others that he could do so without being affected by the 'lies' it contained; Byron was wrong. This movie changed his life. Since his release he tours the country paying visits to skinhead and nazi groups with a DVD player and a well worn copy of this movie. They listen to him because he still has the tattoos and knows how to reach these people. Take away everything this movie has accomplished and changed save for Byron Smith and it was still worth all the money, time and sacrafice it took to create."
Cocacolaguy912-2,"Jul 9, 2007",10/10,"This film, along with Amistad and perhaps a few others, show that Steven Spielberg is not just a cutesy, non-brutal, gentle director as some of his films make him out to be. This film is not cliché or heartwarming. The truth is that if you are going to make a film about something as horrifying and terrible as The Holocaust, you have to be brutal. And Spielberg was necessarily brutal. What's depicted in this film is extremely upsetting, and I wish not go into detail fear I upset myself and furthermore upset you. It's not gory or bloody like a war film, (although there are some scenes that boarder on gory), but rather, as you may have guessed, emotionally brutal. I am not a Jewish individual, but I can honestly say, just as a human being, this film upsets me. Schindler's List is extremely well made, with excellent performances, and shot in black and white which I felt set the bitter, old tone.This is not for the faint of heart, but certainly a very essential, moving film.One a final note, a praise Spielberg for two things. One would be for making this film for absolutely no money, and also for not turning it into a ""German hate"" movie."
filmfreund,"Feb 4, 2004",10/10,"There's the ancient story of Orpheus who's going into the underworld to free his wife and who failed. Then there's another story of a man who's going into the hell on earth called Auschwitz to free some hundred women and their children and he succeeded. The difference between these two stories is that the last one is true. Now many people will ask why that man by the name of Oskar Schindler did that. I think I know the answer. There's another scene in this great movie in which you can see Schindler and one of his many lovers by his side riding horses. They are witnessing the liquidation of the ghetto from the top of a hill nearby and staring at the scenes in disbelief and horror. Many Jews are killed in front of their eyes (of course the murderers are not aware of them) but Schindler isn't looking away. He isn't turning his back to the victims until the woman by his side is telling him to leave. Sometimes the last century is called the century of genocide. These genocide were possible because millions and millions of people were looking to the other side, while their neighbors were carried away, beaten to death, shot. I'm not sure if I would do the same but if you watch this film what you really should do you will see that one man can truly make a difference if he's not looking away."
independantyam,"Jul 7, 2004",9/10,"This film is unique, inspiring, haunting, and ... well, long, all at once. It differentiates itself from all other movies that have so far been made about the Holocaust. Why? Little things like filming in black and white, John William's amazing score, and a look at the perspective of the Nazis, which is uncommon.Not only is the story beautiful, but it is reinforced by wonderful performances from the actors, good dialogue and music.Go see this movie. It will change the way you see things. It makes the victims of the Holocaust as well as the Nazis real people, instead of generalizing like our modern day does without knowing it."
simon-gangl,"Oct 26, 2003",10/10,"Right after ""The fellowship of the ring"". I liked the second one more because of its story, effects, sound, acting and its a really magnificent movie. But on the other hand we have a moving, perfect movie. It presents a so important part of history, reminds us of what happened in a very emotional way, but never gets boring (sorry, but many other great movies have this HUGE ""error""). With Liam Neesons (Oscar Schindler) and  Ralph Fiennes (Amon Göth) we see two of the best performances ever (together with Marlon Brandos and Robert de Niros Godfather).It has also some moments which stand out from the whole movie and will stay with me for all time (what is a proof for really good movies). Here are 2:-When the first train wrongfully brings the Jews to Auschwitz and we see a colon of people walking into a building. Then the camera moves slowly to the top where we see a huge chimney, out of it coming black dust and we hear only the sound of the fire...-When Schindler is ""recrouting"" people for his factory he also employs a teacher. When the teacher is sad by the Nazis he isnt ""important"" he cant understand it. He says: Since when arent literature and history important? I love this sceen and its in my opinion the best of the movie. History-we must know the history so we dont make the same mistakes as people already made (racism...). and literature- literature represents of what are humans possible. Creating something beautiful, that has not really a practical use (dont misunderstand this!) but its made for higher reasons. The Nazis dont understand higher reasons, they just want them to work, so they can win the war. There is no space for something beautiful.-Finaly one of the last scenes: When Schindler is driving away at the end. He starts to compare things to human lives...: This symbol, its made of gold. For it i could save two lives!...And there are much more! One of the best movies of all time and for all time!"
fjona22,"Jul 24, 2016",10/10,"it was a very sad movie but i can say a beautiful one ...one of the most beautiful movies ever made. i saw it one of these nights , when i was scrolling in a Facebook page. i saw a photo and the caption intrigued me . Later i saw it was Spielberg's movie so i thought i must see it,I'm so sorry i did n hear of it earlier before.i don t now what else to say but i loved the acting and everything seemed so real and heartbreaking to me. we need to see these kind of movies to know history in the e roots and to feel it..which is the most important thing,and this is thanks to the cast of this masterpiece.a must see one."
peterhokee,"Jun 10, 2006",10/10,"Its hard to believe that this movie came from the same loins that spawned ""War of the Worlds ""(crock of shite). As a male in his late 30's i prefer to watch this movie alone ie; unwitnessed by any females. It never fails to move me. It is up there with Shawshank Redemption and Apollo 13. The soundtrack is just ""spot on "" as it is in the other above-mentioned movies.When u compare Fiennes performance in this vs The Constant Gardner , it shows his tremendous versatility. Likewise , check out ""Sexy Beast"" and remember Ishtak Stern.Kingsley-u are the man.(remember that tear when he finally decides to ""have that drink"" with Oskar) .As for Neeson,this is the movie he will look back on in years to come with the most pride.To all involved, thank you most sincerely"
GiraffeDoor,"Mar 22, 2019",3/10,"I reviewed this movie far more thoroughly back when I had a different account but I want to have one on my profile.The basic problem with this movie for me is that it is not the movie it should me, not unlike Bird Box. It SHOULD be the story of Oskar Schindler saving some Jews but it's actually just an exhibition of the holocaust.There's little plot and as much as I like the macabre of genocide, it gets tiring just getting death after death without much sense of plot progression.It's smugly blunt about its deaths without giving any real reflection on why this atrocity is happening. Then there are incongruously lyrical monologues.It's a simpering and ostentatious historical slasher that jacks itself off over genocide without any real depth or characterization, imaginative moments notwithstanding.Also, this is in English and that's not OK. Why go to such depths to recreate a particular time and place but then ruin that illusion in such an obvious way? Doesn't the German language convey the tone so much better?Don't get your hopes up...regarding the IMDB ratings it is, for me, the most over-rated movie."
andreasnavia,"May 15, 2004",N/A,"The first time I watched this film I was 13 years old. I saw it because my History´s teacher put it on class, as he explained us The Second World War. I watched it that day in class and 2 more times at home that afternoon. I couldn´t belive what I was seeing!! We all knew what had happened to the Jewish but as a I saw the film time after time I couldn´t understand how people, how ourselves, could go too far.I agree with many people about this is a very hard film and about sometimes it is difficult to continue watching it, but I think it is the most perfect film I have ever seen because of its realism, because this film explains us what it really happened. It is disturbing, sad and horrible, but actually for me it is the most beautiful film in the world because thanks to it I can see (not study, not read, I CAN SEE) what happened during one of the most important moments of our History."
linkinwinchester,"Mar 10, 2004",10/10,"To watch this film, you must be prepared to be horrified. By horrified, I don't mean that all of a sudden, a killer comes from out of nowhere and hacks off someone's limb, with blood and guts all over. No, I mean the true horror... from the fact that what you watch really happened sixty years ago. It is a film that just leaves you without the ability to speak. To walk away from this film dry-eyed is to not be human. Many 'Best Picture' winners are actually overrated... Chicago?... A Beautiful Mind??... The English Patient???... to name a few recent ones. Yet Schindler's List is not overblown, and for all its praise, is still underrated, for it deserves better than the best recognition. This is not just a film... not just three hours to while away your time. This is a lesson in humanity. Schools everywhere should make this part of their curriculum for High School, to teach the future leaders of the world what mankind is capable of. It's not what we could do. It's what mankind DID.Some say the number of Jews murdered -- Six Million -- is overblown... but I say, be it six million or two million, or even just one single person, what happened was horrible and inexcusable. I myself am a descendent of a Nazi, and for their crimes, I say to all... LEARN from history, and never forget it.Steven Spielberg, my hat's off to you."
longislandjoe,"Sep 3, 2006",10/10,"The story of Oskar Schinlder, a German by birth who wants to make money in WW II by getting Jewish investors and workers to produce pots and pans in a factory.The performances are outstanding. Liam Neeson is Oskar and he is wonderful. Ralph Fiennes is the Nazi camp commander and his performance personifying evil is astounding. Ben Kingsley, one of the great actors of ANY era, is magnificent as Stern, the accountant who helps Oskar and at the same time stays under everyone's radar while helping his people during their incarceration.I could go on and on but that basically describes it. I give it the greatest compliment I could ever give a movie: DON'T MISS IT!"
alexirimescu,"Mar 30, 2004",10/10,"i had never seen a movie like that, it seem so realistic and it surly convinced me on how cruel those years were.... My opinion is that this movie is truly a masterpiece! i have seen several movies with this subject, some were good some weren't but history is the same and it is unbelievable what those cruel soldiers thought about themselves and their leader ..................................... the film is based on a real story and that makes it special. the actors are great , the directed by Steven Spielberg, what do you want more? let's say it had it all Drama Action War and so on..... this is my last line.... and i am finishing... the end!"

Go now to your local library an ask to rent this movie ! :)"
TheMovieeGuy,"Mar 4, 2004",10/10,"I distinctly remember seeing Schindler's List in a darkened theater during my last year attending the University of Southern California, back in late 1993. The buzz about this film was astounding. Fresh from directing the summer 1993 box office smash, Jurassic Park, Steven Spielberg was about to completely abandon the famous popcorn movie for which he was so well known to take on one of the darkest chapters of the 20th century, the holocaust. Many critics doubted that Spielberg was up to the task of directing such a dark moment in human history.This film is by far Spielberg's best dramatic film, this and Saving Private Ryan proves beyond any doubt that Spielberg is more than capable of directing a powerful dramatic film as well as other great directors like Martin Scorese and Francis Ford Coppola. His use of black and white only illustrates how great and mature a storyteller he has become in recent years.The 11 years since it's release has deminished it's impact on society, but let no one forget the haunting images of this masterpiece.The DVD looks completely amazing with terrific digital clarity, and great sound. Unforunately, as with Spielberg's other films on DVD, this one has no director's commentary whatsoever.This is defintely the best film of the 1990's and winner of seven Academy Awards, including best picture. Oscar worth performances from Liam Neeson, Ben Kingley, and of course, the memorable Ralph Fiennes!This haunting film also proves without a doubt that Spielberg is one of the best directors to ever work in Hollywood!"
Jeen,"Nov 11, 2007",10/10,"Simply put, this is the most powerful film I've ever seen in my life.I missed it in the theater, but caught it on home video (VHS even! How quaint!). I had heard all the buzz about it...but I wasn't prepared for the IMPACT. At the end of the film, I was an emotional wreck, both amazed and horrified at the extremes of human behavior.Yes, it is a film based on historical events. But it does not attempt to paint its characters as pure. Liam Neeson delivers as Schindler, while Ben Kingsley and Ralph Fiennes--hell, the entire cast--turn in some truly powerful performances.The criticism of this movie astonishes me. I cannot, for the life of me, figure out some people in this world. Let me put it another way--if you are not moved even a little by this film, or if you use snarky, cynical reasons to bash it, you're not even human. You don't even have a soul. You don't care.This film will resonate long after we are gone, as well as it should. The Holocaust did happen. And yes, millions of other people besides Jews were slaughtered. But SCHINDLER'S LIST reminds us to never forget the holocausts of history. Never forget--never again."
Joshuaselig-22,"Nov 11, 2003",10/10,"This film is a masterpiece it shows the ferocity and evil of the Nazi regime during WWII. It displays the dehumanising of the Jewish people of which previous films had failed to display to the level that Schindler's list has shown.The film shows the change over an individual who at the start is seen as a cruel, vindictive businessman who after seeing the tragedy of the jewish people shows compassion and empathy to those that the Nazi regime wishes to get rid off like lambs to the slaughter.Having the film in black and white is a masterstroke, allowing the viewer to see the footage rather than being distracted by the colour, it is a superb film and if watched should move you to tears."
tosmartu2,"Jul 13, 2006",10/10,"i have seen a lot of movies from Spielberg this one is next level , a great great movie i am Muslim and this movie mostly is about jew's but this movie is not bout racism its about humanity and the thing what one guy ( Osaka) did is amazing for Jew's at the end of the movie i really cried....got emotional .anyways guys watchout for this movie and i am suggesting especially any jew should watch and learn wot ""Osaka"" did for their generation. like in this movie its says ""you save one person life u saves the whole generation"" and also this movie is about cruel German army to jew's, but the funny thing is if Jew's watch this movie and learn they should realize are they not doin same in gaza wot German did to them back in history......."
elenamartin-43024,"Feb 21, 2020",6/10,"This movie surely has its moments, but in certain scenes you just get the feeling that you need to feel and react a certain way. I felt manipulated a few times into crying. There was something to planned about the emotions that should be created. Still a beautiful movie"
dkingsman-83372,"Jul 12, 2015",5/10,Based on a fiction book not historical facts. (Check if you don't believe me)Once again the German people made out to be monsters by a Jewish director. I really hope that one day we can show our children the truth.Movie is great though with good acting. I could not really take it seriously. Just a Hollywood war film along the same lines as The Alamo or other inaccurate historical plots made to order on silver screen.Disgusting that it was taken to schools and pupils allowed to view as true history.
skedi_k6,"Mar 26, 2018",N/A,"To me, Spielberg's Schindler's List is one of the most incredible movies made to date for several reasons. This classic film is an emotionally charged historical drama; based on true story. It thugs at your heart, it tells the story of the good in all of us, as Oskar Schindler becomes the unlikely hero, saving the lives of over 1000 Jews during the Nazi madness. I have a VHS collector's copy of the film."
AmyJenson1995,"Jan 22, 2017",10/10,"The Holocaust has been one of the most awful and tragic event of the History of humanity. It will always remain a stain in our legacy, a true proof of how despicable and monstrous we, the human race, can be.That's the main reason why the Schindler's List should be praised. It goes far beyond the cast, the awards, the revenue it produced. This movie has been made so we cannot forget and repeat the same atrocities. While more and more survivors of this tragedy are passing away, taking with them their testimonies and there are still people who dare ignoring that those events truly happened, The Schindler's list and its message will always remain for everyone to see.So I won't review the movie like a simple piece of art. Sure Liam Neeson and Ralph Fiennes or Ben Kingsley are awesome in that movie and they sure each should have received a so well deserved award for their performance but that's not the most important. The only fact that they are part of this movie should make them proud. If through it, they could help prevent that such horrible tragedies like the Holocaust happen again and save millions of lives in the process, it's definitely worthier than any Oscar or Golden Globe on your shelves! So thank you Steven, Liam, Ralph, Ben and everyone who made this movie a reality. Let your message be spread and shared from generations to generations. So we could never forget and say never again!"
claudiasilvaoliveira,"Apr 15, 2017",10/10,For me is the best movie of all time.The story brings together a strategic side and a strong emotional one.Last scene is unforgettable.This movie is for me a life lesson to remember.I'll watch it again for sure.
SMAhm2003,"Sep 18, 2003",9/10,"I think this is absolutely a great movie! There are definitely things in this movie that are not good to see.  I think that this is probably one of the most informational movies of all time.  The sad part about it is that Oskar Shindler really did help the Jews, but only for his own personal gain.  The German leaders knew this, but the tiny number of Jews that he saved did not constitute an emergency on their part.  Good movie!"
tjc60,"May 2, 2004",9/10,"Initially presented as capitalistic and crude, Schindler's character gradually evolves into one of benevolence, and finally, humility. The film is shot entirely in black and white, with the exception of one character. A little girl wearing a pink jacket, which we see only twice in the film. It is that little girl, and the thought of what surely must happen to her, that sticks in one's mind. The two fleeting glimpses we get of this girl are more heart-wrenching than anything else in this film. This is not only an historical film;it has modern relevance as well. There are monsters among us, and poverty and ignorance are their life's blood. Overall,I give the film a 9. It's truly hard for a film to rate a 10 with me, which is the way it should be."
insenlysen,"Jun 23, 2006",10/10,"When I was done with seeing this movie I realized that I had stayed glued to the screen for 3 hours without my attention getting diverted.The acting especially from Liam Neeson as Oskar and Ralph Fiennes as Amon Goethe is a notch above anything I have seen.When one realizes that Oskar Schindler,a man who initially started out with the intention of making a quick buck out of the war situation and who after having failed in earlier businesses must obviously be determined to do well this time around, gives up all his money,his fortune and his shot at a good life in order to save the lives of people who were being cruelly butchered,one is moved,deeply moved.The scenes of the massacre of the ghetto and the way the people trying to hide were systematically hunted down are disturbing scenes..yet they serve to elevate the viewing experience and also are stark brutal reminders of the depravity humans are capable of.With the rising intolerance the world over this movie acts as a reminder,a warning and also a beacon of hope.it is both a testimonial to what one man's conviction is capable of...on the one hand we have Schindler who almost singlehandedly saves 1200 Jews and on the other we have Hitler who is responsible for the near extermination of Jews."
SuperBadgerr,"Jul 13, 2007",10/10,"I saw this movie last night, I was so moved by the whole movie, although the first hour is talking, once you see what happens to the Jewish when they are done talking you begin to be afraid for them yourselves.I think Speilburg's idea to use black and white is simply stunning as is his idea for The Little Girl In Red and the tiny bit of yellow in eyes, it adds so much more. The characters in this make the movie so much more realistic (I've heard they were in talks for Mel Gibson or Kevin Costner to lead) every bit of acting is great even the children that are only on screen for several seconds how they get fear in their eyes. The end, just ends everything so nicely because how else could you end such a tragedy?So My rating- 10/10 See this movie."
Eric_Ruan,"May 11, 2012",4/10,"The story is about the efforts that Oskar Schindler (Liam Neeson), a World War II profiteer, put out in order to save the Jews from Plaszow concentration camp. Let us make it very clear: from the starting point, Schindler has no interest in saving the Jews. His sole interest, at first, was to make money. How was this man converted from being an opportunistic businessman into a courageous human soul who was willing to save thousands of lives? He even appeared initially unaffected when SS-Lieutenant Amon Goth (Ralph Fiennce) blissfully murdered innocent Jews. How, then, could this man break down at the end of the film because he could not save just one more life is baffling. Agreed that he was surrounded by good Jews, but the probable reason for his transition (encountering a dead Jews who thanked him) was utterly self-congratulatory. Was he even terrified by the murders that were going on (if he was, he never showed it on screen any way)? Perhaps, only the extraordinary Schindler himself could help Spielberg realize it. Or did Spielberg care about strong characterizations, at all? There was no complexity here.However, Liam Neeson's Schindler was given pretty decent treatment when you consider the other elements in Schindler's List. Particularly was, the vicious monster of the story, Lieutenant Amon Goth. Was he the only one who killed (or loved killing) Jews throughout this whole affair? I had this question on my mind when the film exclusively focused on him insanely shooting random Jews from his bedroom. Giving a mad figure the special treatment of being the leading culprit of this mass murder is a laughably simplistic way to make sense of the Holocaust. And it fits into the general audience's banal understanding of the event. The key to Holocaust is the diffusion of responsibility among the persecutors and the lack of moral convictions on the very part of the human race. Those complex concepts were given no treatment in Schindler's List. Instead, everything is reduced to insanity. The very possibility of the Holocaust, therefore, remains alien to a whole audience, who, perhaps, come to see the film just to feel a sense of grandness and liberal guilt. Raplh Fience was terrific in his performance. However, his role, sadly, served as a springboard for the audience to blindly put their blame on. How revealing!In short, the treatment of both Schindler and Goth shed no light on the ambiguity of human nature. Schindler suddenly became ""good"" while Goth was inherently ""bad"" (This only makes the visual comparisons between the two men all the more exploitative). Everything seems pretty common sense, and obviously very digestible. However, if there is a most deplorable injustice being done here, it was the presentation of the Jewish community. Perhaps, everyone who has watched this film can recall the scene of a little girl splashed in red that Schindler spotted during the liquidation of the concentration camp. Anyone could have been fooled by this imagery, whether a film amateur or a veteran film fan. However, if you sit back to think about it, the image is pretty fortuitous. What does this present exactly? Hope? Love? Future? Or even blood? This middle-browned attempt to convey some visual meanings does not succeed in any meaningful way. Worse still, it is an exploitation of the bathos of childhood innocence, which does not make sense in this circumstance. We are dealing with the Jewish community as a whole, not some selective individuals that were singled out from this whole in order for us to dwell on 'sophisticated' feelings of loss and hope. If there is a lesson that is unforgettable about the Holocaust, it is the unjustified prejudice and hatred inflicted upon the Jewish community as a race, not just the brutality and violence that any particular Jew experienced (if you want to know about brutality and trauma, you can ask the 20 million Russians who were dead also). Why not color every Jew red then? Any selective visual presentation in this case is misguiding; and manipulative. Even the sequence that precedes it, a moral struggle between mother, daughter and childhood friend during evacuation does not feel like a climax. It is so trite, so predictable that one might just allow himself to rumble with all the emotions that Spielberg has designed for him. It feels as if, the audience is told what they already know, and all they need to do is sit there, ruminating like an act.The saddest thing is that at the end, when the credit rolls ""In memory of the 6 million Jews who died during the Holocaust"", I wonder what the whole film has to do with those 6 million deaths. If you are inattentive and easy-going, you would freely accept it as an earnest tribute to them. But really? Telling the cliché story of a thousand who were alive is the tribute to the 6 million who were dead? What does this film have to do with the dead anyway? The desperation, the horror, the pain, the shame and the doubt of those who went dead were not adequately conveyed. Oh, just tell the marvelous story of saving lives to make the audience open their mouths and wonder. And we can forget about those who were dead. What a lovely tribute that Spielberg made!The real story is extraordinary. But there must be a way of telling it without this pretentious sense of self-importance that makes it so easily consumed by an uninformed audience. At no point in this film, do I feel a sense of desperation, that sense of ""needing to get out of this horrible nightmare"". It was just like watching a prodigious show that make you feel ""wowed"" (and admire, and cry?). But remember that grandness cannot replace substance. Indeed, Holocaust is a very difficult subject matter. It needs to be approached first with intelligence. But Spielberg evidently failed to do so."
ofratko,"Feb 17, 2012",N/A,There are almost 1000 reviews about this movie but I still have to write mine. This movie changed my life. I firstly watched it when I was 14 and it was the most powerful movie I have ever seen. I cried several times during the movie. Everybody should see this movie. It's universal and gift for all generations to come. Acting wise R. Fiennes's performance was one of the best I have ever seen and he deserved an Oscar for it.Liam Neelson is great as well very subtle in his performance. I believe entire cast was great. Excellent actors who played their parts with passion and devotion.Some ppl don't like the black and white picture I believe it created perfect atmosphere in the movie. If you haven't watched you must at least once in your life
tatmeister,"Feb 2, 2008",9/10,"I watched Schindler's List a week ago in U.S history class, and at first I thought ""Oh great!. I'm watching a movie on the Holocaust in black and white. How can this actually make me learn any more about the Holocaust than I have in a textbook?"" My teacher put the tape on, and the first hour was a boredom fest, but as the characters such as Stern and Schindler develop their personalities, the movie becomes inspiring and hooked. I then removed the ""boredom fest"" aspect of my thinking, and transformed it into ""necessary story development/build-up"" At first we think Schindler is heartless, but having a personality and morales, he experiences the death of Jews firsthand. Of course, seeing such mindless mass executions will boggle anyone's mind. Schindler, who happens to be rich off of the Jews in WW2, helps them. The first hour of the movie is devoted to making the last 2 hours as commiserable for the audience as possible- making us feel connected to Schindler's emotions. ""What if we were in his shoes?"" not only that, the movie is an excellent depiction of the Holocaust. Black-and-white does the film justice, as it gives the movie a ""WW2 feel."" If it were in complete color, it's effects would not have been as strong. Watch this movie if at all possible. Emotions cannot be depicted by learning about the Holocaust in a classroom- you are simply being educated about the facts. Schindler's List reinforces this classroom learning by supplying empathy with the facts. After reading about WW2, this is one of the few movies that are a must-see. The acting, directing and editing is marvelous. Only problem I had was the length of the movie."
allie-hearts-canada,"Apr 17, 2004",10/10,"I've researched the holocaust greatly, and have watched numerous movies about the Holocaust. Schindler's List has to be the best movie I've seen on the topic. The frank presentation of the violence and indifference of the nazi officers is amazing. Perhaps the most intense scene is when the Schindler's Female workers are sent to Auschwitz instead of his camp. The presentation, music, and cinematography make it one of the best scenes in any movie I have seen. All of the acting is fantastic, but I find Ralph Fiennes' portrayal of Nazi Camp commandant Amon Goeth stunning. Also well acted is Embeth Davidtz in the role of Helena Hirsch, the jewish made of Goeth. He shows both the evil and human sides of the man, and acts them incredibly well. The cinematography is wonderful. Overall, this is a must see movie for all people interested in history."
iamsam103,"May 2, 2004",10/10,"well I have only just seen this film recently due to the new DVD. I was in a way reluctant to watch it as so many people have said how sad it is and the fact that it is in black and white doesnt really appeal to me. But once I sat myself down and switched it on I was very suddenly intrigued by the amount of detail and hard work put into this film. Liam Neeson and Ben Kinglsey are the 2 main stars of this film and carry it very well whereas Ralph Feinnes delivers a shocking and scary performance. it pleased me to see his come-upance at the end.I have to say that I have never cried during a film, never in my life. But towards the end of this film there was a lump in my throat and its true to say that i wasnt choaking on pop-corn. If a film is based on a point in history and is being made by a very talented director and has the certificate of a 15 or an 18 then it has no boundaries and this film is one of them. This is how this film carries itself into my top 10 list. It shows how horrifically the Jews were treated and how it turned into 2 mens struggle to save as many as they possibly could. The end where all the victims of the Nazi's ways placed a stone on Oscar Schindler's grave is extrememly touching and is a perfect end to an excellent film. Too bad Speilberg doesnt make films like this these days...now we're given A.I and Minority Report...such a shame"
jaddison383,"Dec 12, 2007",10/10,"This is a film that will be remembered forever. There's not many films that can boast that, but this film definitely can. It is truly one of the greatest films ever made.Oskar Schindler started off the same as most of the men of his Nazi party: He loved women, good wine, and making money. He started a factory in the middle of the war and made money using Jewish slaves as workers. He sold parts to Nazi armies, eventually becoming one of the nation's wealthiest men. As he began to be invited into the inner circle of the Nazi's, though, he began to see the horrors of what was really going on; He began to see the horror of himself. And he began to try to save the Jews.Shot in stark black and white with rare glimpses of color, Schindler's List is a true masterpiece. Steven Spielberg completely recreates what is one of the darkest times in human history with startling reality and shows a new generation exactly how terrible it was. At the same time an uplifting story, a horror film, and a dramatic saga, Schindler's List will forever change you. It is a not a lighthearted film to be enjoyed on a Sunday afternoon- it may disturb you. But it is a must-see for everyone so that we can better understand what really happened in that terrible war. Superb film-making is all around in this film. A must see! 10/10 stars!Jay Addison"
jddevine,"Jul 10, 2004",10/10,"What a story! Somewhere in the definition of ""life-affirming,"" the title of this movie should appear. I had to ""persuade"" my wife to go see it with me (again) because she thought it would be depressing. It is not, and she loved it.I thought the characters were fascinating, and the acting was fabulous. The emotion on scree is electric; it's clear these folks were inspired.Haunting images too. The one that gets me the most is the motion the child makes as the train goes by. Everything that is wrong with the world, right there in one image.Just the music of the film is enough to make me tear up. If you don't like instrumental music, you might after this film.This film sucks me in every time I see it. It goes by so fast; it always seems to last about 15 minutes.The last scene of the movie has to be one of the top film endings of all time. It floored me.Thanks to all who helped make it."
