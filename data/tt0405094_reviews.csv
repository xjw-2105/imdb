Cloudmeister,"Apr 17, 2007",9/10,"I am still quite speechless. Overwhelmed by how utterly compelling the story was and by how emotive the acting story was. Floored by the unbelievably great character development. This film is close to perfect. It is a spiritual cousin to 2004's magnificent Downfall and shares a lot of similarities with Paul Verhoeven's stunning Black Book from last year, not just because these films share two actors. This multi-faceted character driven masterpiece really is as good as it's hype says.Sebastian Koch in particular absolutely shines. He is one of the best international actors working today and he follows the brilliance of his role in Black Book with the lead here. With his bohemian, dishevelled good looks and brilliant charisma, he's the best German-speaking actor since Bruno Ganz. But he is far from the only good actor in this movie, Ulrich Mühe as the State Security (Stasi) agent whose task it is to monitor Koch's suspiciously free thinking playwright, brings another near perfect performance to the movie. Agent Wiesler initially appears to the audience as the polar opposite of Koch's character. With his grey button down clothing, closely cropped hair and consistently emotionless face he symbolises everything about the overbearing untrusting Socialist government of East Germany that is wrong. He could easily have remained that character throughout the whole film but he becomes the surprising emotional centre of the story and the line between heroes and villains is significantly shifted (something which extends to the supporting cast as well. Truth be told there are probably only two characters in this film whom I didn't have to rethink my opinion of). Weisler reveals himself as a lonely, isolated man who risks his entire career as his attitude to his subject changes from one of mistrust to one of near-adoration. There is an undeniable link between the two characters even though they never share a single scene and Georg Dreyman (Koch) doesn't even find about Wiesler until the last 10 minutes of the movie, which leads us up to what should go down as one of the greatest endings in cinema history. Just thinking about the final spoken lines brings the tears to my eyes.As I said, without a doubt one of the greatest movies I have ever seen. And as much as I adore Pan's Labyrinth, this one really did deserve it's Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film of the Year. An absolute masterpiece."
boblovinger,"Sep 11, 2006",8/10,"I saw this film in its North American premiere in a packed theater at the Toronto Int'l Film Festival this past week and was pleased to be part of a standing ovation at the end for the director and star, who were both on hand.""The Lives of Others,"" set in East Germany not long before the fall of the Berlin Wall, tells the moving story of a police investigator forced to confront himself and the work he does. In a society poisoned by secrecy, fear and the abuse of power, a number of the movie's characters -- artists, actors, writers -- must look deep inside and decide what they are made of; none more so than the investigator.This is a movie that took me to a place and time that felt very authentic, for a tale that was very satisfying.Ulrich Muhe, who plays the investigator, is mesmerizing, and the young director is to be applauded for this, his first full-length film. Some have compared ""The Lives of Others"" to Coppola's ""The Conversation"" but the two have completely different story arcs and are only superficially similar.Both my companion and I felt this was our favorite of the six films we had a chance to see at the festival."
wisewebwoman,"Mar 8, 2007",10/10,"I wonder why there has been so little written and publicized about this movie. This should be seen in every country and its merits trumpeted from the skies.It starts off slowly and the locale is the former East Germany, inhabited by 16 million people who are being spied upon relentlessly by their secret police. In this very real world of the Berlin Wall, there are many Stasi, 90,000, overseeing the populace, aided and abetted by hundreds of thousands of informants. Many of these snitches were blackmailed or other pressures exerted (threats to children and loved ones) and a few obliged voluntarily.What is truly amazing is that this is Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's directorial debut, and he maintains a masterful hand throughout and keeps the story and the tension rolling from the first scene of interrogation which is filmed back and forth between a tape educating new Stasi as to interview techniques and to the actual cell itself where it was recorded.The movie circles around three main characters and there is a wider circle of the powerful who pull the puppet strings for a variety of reasons which become clear as the movie unfolds.First is Georg Dreyman, a playwright on the verge of celebrating his 40th birthday. Sebastian Koch, a tall,handsome actor dressed in writerly rumple, shares an apartment with his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), and exists within the strictures of the state-sponsored theatre. He is a decent man, and tries to win support for his blacklisted friends.For reasons that become quite clear, Dreyman falls under suspicion and the whole sophisticated Stasi spying system comes into play in the era of 1984. His whole apartment is bugged and every sound is monitored.The man in charge of all this is Captain Gerd Wiesler,(Ulrich Mühe). Ulrich's performance is nothing short of stunning. He starts as an almost robotic presence, dressed in gray, he almost disappears into every scene he's in. But one detects a clear intelligence in his bright eyes, the only part of him that's alive. Captain Wiesler lives in a non-descript arborited apartment, much like himself. He squeezes his food onto a plate from a tube.But the captain starts to awaken slowly as he listens surreptitiously on the state of the art equipment secreted in the attic of Dreyman's building. He starts to fall in love with the couple and then pressure from above is brought to bear on him to dig for the dirt in Dreyman's life.And he is in a dilemma now, as he is drawn further and further into the life of Dreman and his girlfriend.I won't throw spoilers down. Suffice to say is that the story is enthralling right down to the very last frame. The acting is superb, the direction impeccable and the world of East Germany meticulously drawn with the viewer respected enough to find his or her own emotional path through the plot.The ending is truly one of a kind. So right and true that I was left nodding, it was the only one possible.A must see, I will sing the praises of this film to all I know. 10 out of 10 from me. Right up there in my top 50 of all time. I find it so disappointing that these movies don't get wider release AND compete for an Oscar in the best picture of the year and not just for best foreign film. Now there's a heretical thought!"
drgyn2000,"Apr 13, 2007",10/10,"After seeing the outstanding Pan's Labyrinth, I could not understand how anything could beat it to the Oscar for Best Film, let alone the accolade of Best Foreign Film. That was until I saw The Lives of Others.Putting it simply, this is the best film released in years. The framework of the story surrounds a Stasi officer who is assigned to monitor a writer and his actress girlfriend considered loyal to East German regime. That is all I am prepared to reveal because this film operates on so many levels that I wouldn't know where to begin. On the surface this can be enjoyed as a taut drama but essentially it is a study of the human condition and the capacity for compassion and humanity exists in even the most inhumane people. All of this is shot against the backdrop of the greys and browns of communist East Germany.As a film it is virtually flawless. The three central performances are nothing short of electric, with particularly Ulrich Muhe giving one of the greatest leading man performances since Al Pacino in The Godfather. None of this would be possible without a brilliant script and exemplary direction, that brings the characters to life extracting the best out of the actors. The result is no words are wasted, and every scene is relevant and expertly conceived. This manages to explore deep issues without being turgid, is moving without being draining and remains gripping and entertaining without being superficial.In summary, this is film-making at its finest. It is the sort of movie that you'll go down on bended knee and pay homage to the inventor of cinema, because it is films like this that cinema was created for. You'll forgive a year of tedious sequels and cash cows, for the one day that films like this get released.10 out of 10 is too modest."
hareck,"May 20, 2006",10/10,"I do agree with all the other positive comments, and just need to add that this is the very first movie about the former GDR I saw that is not something like a comedy. Flicks like ""Sonnenallee"" or ""Good bye Lenin"" definitely were great and funny, but unconsciously left myself (a West German) with the impression that the GDR has been a sort of ""Mickey Mouse State"" full of stupid but charming characters, not really to be taken seriously. After seeing ""Das Leben der Anderen"" this impression shifted quite a bit: there actually was suffering, killing desperation and a terribly claustrophobic atmosphere behind that wall. This might well be the most realistic depiction of the dark side of the former East Germany. Thanks to the Producers, actors and director for making this movie. 10 out of 10."
nick-6,"Oct 16, 2007",10/10,"This film utterly blew me away. Full disclosure: I'm a German born (Munich born) German-American who left Germany in 1986, before the wall came down. I cannot describe the feeling I felt as the last few words were spoken on the screen. I could not look at the subtitles ( a habit of speaking two languages ) because my eyes were so full of tears. I cannot tell you how I was so sorry I did not experience the wall coming down. This film healed a wound that may have been left by the nightmare years of 1938-1945, my own great uncle being a Nazi war criminal, convicted in Nuremberg in 1946. Yes, we are mensch too. We have the potential for greatness (of character) in spite of our history. Thank you Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, for giving me back half of my lost soul in this single ""es ist für mich"". I am reminded again that the difference between ourselves and beasts is that we have a choice."
anastasia_smile,"Mar 24, 2006",10/10,"East Berlin, November 1984. Five years before its downfall the GDR seeks to maintain its power with the help of a merciless system of control and observation. When Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz puts loyal Stasi-Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler on to the famous writer Georg Dreymann and his girlfriend Christa Maria Sieland who is a famous actress herself, he expects career advancement for himself. For most important politicians are responsible for this ""operative act"".What Wiesler did not expect: the intimate view on the world of the ones he's observing changes the snitch as well. Looking at ""the life of the others"" makes him aware of the beggarliness in his own life and enables access to a so far unknown world of love, free thinking and speaking he is hardly able to elude. But the system can't be stopped anymore and a dangerous game, which destroys the love of Christa Maria Sieland and Georg Dreymann and Wieslers present existence begins.Until the fall of the wall each of them has paid a big price. After that a whole new world begins.My personal opinion - though it doesn't count that much - is that this one a an absolute Must See. I can hardly remember such an intelligent and moving German movie especially not including the whole topic of GDR history and the dealing with it. I think this is the first German movie which shows this system as it used to be (which has been confirmed by several contemporary witnesses) and not turns it and its people into comedy though there have been several good ones, of course."
JohnDeSando,"Mar 7, 2007",N/A,"""Who knows the secrets of the human heart?"" Col in The Crying GameWhenI saw 2006's Oscar winning Departed, I was satisfied it could be the best picture of the year; then I saw Pan's Labyrinth and thought it imaginatively superior; then I saw Lives of Others, the Oscar choice for best foreign film, and I knew it was the globe's best film of the year, no argument.Lives of Others is what all movie making should strive to be: interesting characters, thrilling plot, superb acting, and thematic weight. It's set in East Berlin, 1984, five years before the Wall's fall and Gorbachev's ""glasnost"" and still felling the tremors of Nazism, in this case the Stasi, a government agency similar to the SS. Capt. Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muehe), a Stasi teacher and coldly efficient information gatherer, surreptitiously watches playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) to get compromising details that would damn Dreyman and open the romantic way for the culture minister, Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme). Oddly for an artist, Dreyman is loyal to socialism, so it is through Sieland that the information must come.The dramatic hub of this absorbing intrigue is the growing affection Wiesler gains for the actress and coincidentally the underground freedom movement, mostly as it is represented by artists and their friends. While his efficiency is amply evident in his cool detachment, similar to that of Rafe Fiennes in Schindler's List and Serg Lopez in Pan's Labyrinth, his humanity seeps out at the edges as he becomes vicariously involved in the artists' lives. First-time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck misses not a beat in slowly revealing the hearts of all his principals while he creates a plot remarkably interesting for a character-driven piece.Few films could mine the rich conflict between the totalitarian state and artists who yearn for freedom of expression, between the loyalties of friends and lovers and the crushing exigency of survival. Lives of Others shows how difficult it is to watch others' lives unfold and not be drawn to their passion. It's rough out there: No other film of 2006 showed that cliché better. Here's looking at you, best film of the year."
gurkpeter,"Aug 12, 2009",7/10,"The story presents an era of total surveillance where anything not in line with the will of the party leaders is punished. Arguments do not exist, just the use of power. I think the story is valid. However it only reflects how people from the West can imagine, interpret and understand life in East Germany. During watching this film I had ambivalent feelings. Ulrich Mühe's performance really gives an authentic example of a Stasi officer and gives us a real feeling what the totalitarian system means. However I think the film lacks authenticity in some sense. Only those feel this subtle lack who have lived in an Easter European country. As a verification I guessed which actor has grown up in East Germany and which not. Then I checked their biographies that 90% confirmed my guesses. Those who have not grown up in East Germany only act. Those who lived in the totalitarian system really give us the authenticity. In summary, I think this is a very good film and the only I know of that exposes the surveillance of totalitarian systems. The performance of Ulrich Mühe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler alone make this film worth seeing. For those who might be interested in the topic I recommend reading the book Celestial Harmonies: A Novel from Péter Esterházy and its second part (Celestial Harmonies: A Novel (P.S.)). In film you could watch any film from Krzysztof Kieslowski, Péter Gothár or Péter Bacsó."
ronsig,"Feb 25, 2007",10/10,"Memories of the 70's and 80's visits in the German Democratic Republic (GDR) flood my mind while watching this film. Some are revolting, some comical and others are frightening. As a student of German, I visited the GDR several times to see pen pal friends. I remember one friend looking around and whispering to me in the S-Bahn - just in case one of the many ""IM's"" (unofficial workers of the Stasi) was listening in.I visited a representative of a magazine for western countries about the GDR and spent one memorable weekend sightseeing with her. Near the end of my visit, she asked me if I would work for them regularly by writing my opinion of ""GDR Review"" and its suitability for readers in the West. I would be paid in GDR money to use during further visits. After politely refusing this ""offer"" (""The police at home might not like it!""), I always had a sneaking suspicion that that was an attempt by the Stasi to recruit me.Years later I applied to see my ""Stasi File"". I will never forget the feeling deep inside me when I read in it: ""..is not suitable for our use due to his apparent connection to the police in his homeland."" The beautiful, friendly lady in Dresden had been a Stasi informer all the time! All of my visits to the GDR and the people I visited were listed in that file. For me ""The Lives of Others"" is an authentic representation of that totalitarian state. I am glad that those times have ended.Congratulations on a well deserved Oscar!"
Seraphion,"Aug 1, 2014",7/10,"The story unravels nicely although a bit too slow for my taste. Yet I really like how the opening exposes the meticulous practice of the Stasi. The introduction of the characters Dreyman and Sieland is also nice, especially if, like me, you watch the movie without any prior knowledge toward this movie. The transition that Wiesler undergoes during the movie is portrayed nicely. This is even better because the movie uses less scene montages. The depiction of Grubitz's dangerous character through bits and pieces scattered along this movie is also nice. I like how Ulrich Muhe played the calm yet meticulous and then the affected version of Wiesler. Martina Gedeck also shows a good performance and went total on this movie. Sebastian Koch does well in completing this movie with his performance of quite an undecided character."
Hprog,"Mar 11, 2007",10/10,"I've been taking German lessons for about 2 months now, and since movies were great in helping me learn English language I'm always looking for German films to watch (as well as German music to listen to) in order to educate my ears.Anyway, I went to this place where I get all sort of rare movies and this one caught my attention... and I had no idea it got the Oscar for foreign language film this year! So I watched it without prejudice and... what did I find? A MASTERPIECE! This is the kind of movie that gets your attention from the first moment, and makes you interested in understanding the characters' psyche, which is very varied: you have the idealistic good guys, the idealistic bad guys, the people that broad their minds understanding that no political dogma is better than individual freedom, etc. And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved.In this present day, when the ghost of authoritarian regimes still fly over our heads (in my country we're getting closer and closer to that reality), this movie will make you think about how important love, life and freedom are.A must see!"
jesse3,"Jan 17, 2007",10/10,"Holy cow! What a terrific movie! I am a voting member of the Academy (actor's branch) so I get all the films for free. I've seen everything---60 films. This was one of the last 3 films that I saw---because I was completely unfamiliar with the title. This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless. The lead actor, who should be doing The Life Story Of Peter Jennings, was wonderful. Everybody was terrific. Congratulations to the writers for their perfect structure---and to the director for his flawless storytelling---and his eliciting of top performances from his actors. How well cast it was.But now I'm totally bewildered. Why haven't I heard anything about this film? Where was this film at the Golden Globes? I haven't even seen any reviews about it. Nothing! What's going on? I'm very active in the film business. I follow this stuff. This film (that I never heard of) took me by surprise as no other film has ever done.Note to the IMDb: This is not a spoiler.Jesse Vint III"
grantss,"Dec 19, 2015",10/10,"Brilliant.East Berlin, 1984. The Cold War is still raging and the communist bloc does not trust its own citizens. A Secret Police agent is tasked with conducting surveillance on a writer and his lover. Over time, rather than being coldly distant, he finds himself being absorbed by their private lives...A great examination of life in East Germany during Communist rule, and how empathy can overcome fascism. Perfect ending.Great performances all round, especially from the three main actors - Martina Gedeck, Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch.Well deserved its Best Foreign Language Film Oscar in 2007, and should have been nominated for more than just that."
bkrauser-81-311064,"Jan 14, 2016",10/10,"In the very first minutes of The Lives of Others, the unassuming Captain Gerd Wiesler (Muhe) sits in a small office interrogating a prisoner of the East German Stasi. He records his progress on tape and within hours Wiesler exhausts his prisoner to the point of confession, The tape stops; Wiesler is in a classroom teaching pupils at the university how to do the same. Within those first minutes we get a strong impression of his character; calculated, reserved and above all meticulous. It's those traits along with his dedication to Communism that make him a perfect surveillance man, at least according to Grubitz (Tukur) his supervisor.After attending a show by the popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Koch), Wiesler and Grubitz take an interest in the internationally acclaimed artist. A nationalist, a pro-Communist and loyal to the government; he must be up to no good figures the curious Wiesler. With the coaxing of the Minister of Culture (Thieme), Wiesler sets up a surveillance operation in the attic of Dreyman's apartment complex and places bugs throughout his abode. It is only after weeks of listening does Wiesler realize the Minister has an interest in Dreyman's mistress Christa (Gedeck). Grubitz sees room for advancement if they manage to find dirt on the playwright but Wiesler becomes enveloped in the complex and intriguing lives of Dreyman and Christa. Wiesler even starts to participate quietly in the shadows, making decisions that could change the fate of all involved forever.The essence of The Lives of Others script is essentially political. The workings of the Stasi serve its own self-survival by becoming a tool of Ministers and party elites. What matters more isn't the innocence or guilt of those who commit crimes against the State but whether those under suspicion have the political clout to protect themselves. Those who don't have two remedies, arrest or suicide. It is in-fact a suicide that initiates Dreyman's disillusionment with the entire system and kicks the torrent of dramatics into high gear. That and Christa's abusive relationship with the Minister.Yet there's something much deeper and beautiful about the story than merely being a manifesto against big brother. The acting is so nuanced and superb that the characters become the focal point of audience emotional investment and story tension. Ulrich Muhe especially deserves praise as a foil to Sebastian Koch's Dreyman. Both become disillusioned but for opposite reasons. While Dreyman starts seeing the forest through the trees sort to speak, Wiesler starts seeing people as people instead of abstractions or obstacles of a Communist ideal.There was much ado about The Lives of Others winning Best Foreign Language film at the Academy Awards over the heavy favorite Pan's Labyrinth (2006). Both are beautifully rendered political parables with tenacious emotional strength yet while one has a sense of exhaustive grandeur and filigree, the other is muted, meticulous, and pensive in its plotting. While some may balk at the thought of a reticent thriller, The Lives of Others uses its less ostentatious style to its advantage as evidenced by the dark green mis en scene of Stasi HQ, the faded warmth of Dreyman's apartment and the sooty grays of the attic where Wiesler quietly listens."
moimoichan6,"Feb 10, 2007",7/10,"The first scene is amazing : you're watching a STASI class, where an interrogatory is meticulously analyze and deconstructed with a scientific method : if the person calms down after a while, she's lying, if she tells the exact same story twice, she's guilty... After this introduction to the method, we're about to watch its application. But unfortunately, watching the live of the others without interfering their live isn't that easy. And the cold Stasi agent will share empathy for his future victims.The way the inhuman agent (greatly plays by Ulrich Mühe) slowly becomes an anonymous hero ( he'll stay a serial number to the end, hidden in the shadows of more brightly people) to the contact of passion, love and art (music, theater and literature), symbolized by the couple he's suppose to watch, is very convincing and greatly develops. The direction of the movie is sober and matured, the actor are all good, and the script is clever enough to give an impression of realism to the all story.For all this ""objectiv"" reasons, this movie is definitely a good movie, and you leave the theater with the impression of having watch a serious piece of art of quality. But still, you wondering... If it was so good, why haven't you really been moved by the story, why this indifference toward the characters, why have you watch it with so little passion ? Of course, the theme, the period and the atmosphere of the film appeals sobriety, it's voluntary made that way. Right, but still, you can't help having the impression that something is missing to this movie, that this lack of passion doesn't necessarily have to move from the characters to the spectators, that the description of a cold and sad age doesn't have to be manufactured that way.In fact, it's madness this film lacks : it's missing a surprising event that wakes the spectator from the monotony of a ""interesting"" feature. Of course, this could have broke the harmony and unity of the movie, and make another ""Black Book"" instead of a so ""well done"" piece of art, but at least, you wouldn't have the impression of watching a nearly scholar movie, made by a good student, who gives you everything you're waiting for in a German movie about the STASI setting in 1984, and doesn't really leave any room to surprise."
aiggpm,"Jun 9, 2015",7/10,"Can you imagine a world where people are continuously spied on, where the police set up surveillance equipment in the attics, where even typewriters are registered and, in spite of this,a world accepting of refugees? I am not talking about science fiction. I am talking about real life, the real events that took place in East Germany before the Fall of the Wall.While I was watching 'The lives of others'I couldn't help comparing it to another film, 'Good Bye, Lenin'; both are widely applauded approaches to the recent history of East Germany. But I think one of them is definitely superior to the other; read on if you'd like to know which.Both films are German and were released more or less at the same time -around 2005- and they share factual accuracy and the atmosphere of that historical period, although the first one takes place mainly in the years before the Fall of the Wall and the second, in the years immediately after. Both films have a lot in common, such as an appealing theme, plausible dialogues, lots of moving scenes and convincing acting. In spite of sharing a common theme, they have different approaches, since 'The lives of others' shows the story of a playwright who is being spied on by 'the Party'. What is a cold relationship at the beginning of the story turns into sympathy, what seems love turns into treason, what should have been informing on somebody turns into respect and admiration. On the other hand, 'Good bye, Lenin!'is very innovative mainly because it has a large dose of comedy, which is remarkably powerful. When his mother suffers a heart attack and awakes from a coma seriously weakened, Alex, the main character has to pretend that nothing has changed, that East Berlin is the same as it was before the Fall of the Wall, because a great shock like that could cause her death, so there he goes doing the impossible to keep the 'status quo'. This situation leads to entertaining scenes and appealing dialogue. In addition, both films were recorded on set and on location -we can enjoy watching what Karl Marx Allee looked like almost thirty years ago.However, although both films portray our recent history very convincingly, I strongly recommend 'Good bye, Lenin!'because it is funny, moving and grabs your attention from the very first moment. And it can also make you think!"
Red-125,"Mar 26, 2007",10/10,"Das Leben der Anderen (2006) (The Lives of Others) was brilliantly written and directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck. The film is a taut thriller. It's also a dramatization of what happened in East Germany--and could happen here--if we allow the government access to every aspect of our lives. Ulrich Mühe stars as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler of the Stasi--the dreaded secret police. The Captain is so talented in interrogation that he gives lectures on interrogation techniques to Stasi cadets.For complex reasons, Wiesler is investigating a prominent couple-- Christa-Maria Sieland, a beautiful and talented actor (Martina Gedeck), and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) an accomplished author and playwright.Artists in East Germany were strictly controlled by the state. Some of them played an intricate cat-and-mouse game with the Stasi--going just far enough to attract notice, but not so far as to bring about arrest. The problem with the cat-and-mouse game was that the cats had very sharp teeth, which they didn't hesitate to use. Blacklisting was just one of the state's weapons--a single word from a high official and you never acted again, or your plays or music were never performed. Although both Christa-Maria and Georg have been careful and discrete, they haven't been careful and discrete enough to escape the Stasi's interest.The movie, although in color, looks as if it were shot in black and white. The mood and the locations are drab and muted. Obviously, the color reflects the political and social situation of the time. The camerwork and editing were outstanding. Every other aspect of the film is equally excellent, particularly the work of the supporting actors.Not only does this film represent a riveting thriller, but it provides a powerful political message. After you've seen The Lives of Others, you won't keep quiet when someone tells you ""I don't care if the government taps my phone; I've got nothing to hide.""This is an extraordinary film--well acted and directed, with a compelling plot and message. Das Leben der Anderen is the finest movie I've seen this year. It's definitely worth seeking out."
cannibal_corpse_59,"Jan 20, 2014",10/10,"I have no words to describe the beauty of this movie.... I am awestruck. I thought no drama movie could come close to Shawshank Redemption, but The Lives of Others is just as good in my view.In a world where Humanity is getting extinct, this movie shows that there is still hope - even from the most unlikeliest of places. 1980s East Germany was a tough place to live in; the people in power were the harshest and yet from there came the ray of light; that even someone reputed to be a cold-blooded and stone-hearted professional could be shaken on the inside.Ulrich Mühe, hats off to him. His portrayal of a stone-cold government- official-turned-soft-hearted-Being was almost unreal. A truly Oscar- deserving performance which didn't get the award, but that doesn't change the fact that his acting was above extra-ordinary.A 10/10 movie for me"
johno-21,"Mar 9, 2007",10/10,"This film is set in the Orlwellian year of 1984 in the old German Democratic Republic of what was known as East Berlin. The Stasi are the ""Shield and the Sword"" of the ruling party of this soviet bloc nation, a secret police force of 100,000 that subjugates another 300,000 to spy for them. This totalitarian system is based on a need to know everything about the countries populace of 16 million. Everything is meticulously documented. Big Brother keeps tabs on any it deems worthy of investigation. Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is a button-down bureaucratic establishmentarian who works as a Stasi interrogator and as an instructor in the school for Stasi. His old schoolmate Lt. Col Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) is now his immediate superior. In an attempt to further his career, Grubitz wants to impress Cultural Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and orders Wiesler to set up an elaborate eavesdropping stakeout to gather information on playwright George Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). Dreyman is a playwright loyal to the party but most his contemporaries have not been including his favorite director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Leinert) who has been blacklisted. Dreyman's live-in girlfriend is the popular stage actress Christina- Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) who is also the object of amorous affection from the sinister, shades of gestapo-like Hemph. This is no ordinary spy thriller. Writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck in his feature film debut gives the screen this wonderfully compelling story of life behind the Iron Curtain in the years leading to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall and continues into 1991 after the reunification of Germany. Wonderful camera work from cinematographer Hagen Bogdanski enhances the stark realism of this film. This is the Academy Award winning Best Foreign Language Film of 2006. I had to see this since it beat out the highly favored Pan's Labyrinth for the Oscar. It's evident to me that Lives of Others is the superior film and the Academy got it right. This film flows so smoothly and your eyes are constantly on every movement on the screen that it's hard to believe you are reading subtitles too. Gabriel Yared's original composition for the film ""Sonata for a Good Man"" is a pivotal piece of it's storyline. I can't help but give this film my highest rating of a 10 out of 10 and I would highly recommend it."

The setting is East Germany before the fall of the wall, but the message ripples out to all individuals who feel their society offers them a life less dignified than they deserve.I hesitate to say any more for fear of despoiling a cinematic experience you should come to unencumbered by the biases of any particular reviewer. You will be moved deeply by this film, and come away feeling better about your life. What other recommendation do you need? See it."
jassas,"Apr 16, 2006",10/10,"having had the joy - while not living in the old gdr itself - to have some ""accidental"" run ins with the good old stasi then, i found it awkward that a German director from the ""west"" would have the guts to take on the subject of this ""ministry of greyness"".writer/director florian henkell von donnersmarck (nice name for a teutonic director, me thinks, very fancy - makes you bang your heels) not only survived this bout of pretension which could have let him drowned in a swamp of reproaches and allegations about executing the ""justice of the winners"", but he transformed the tale into a story that can and will be understood anywhere in the world: a tale about power, treason and the almost anarchistic potency of emotions.while at the same time not falling into the trap of moralizing with a waving finger but showing us ""the system"" as an bureaucratic nightmare powered by - eventually - once even good intentioned human robots of socialist self-righteousness who actually destroy all real positive socialist impulses in the ones they plague, this film is - even if one disagrees with it's premises - probably the most important political drama coming out of Germany for years."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Mar 27, 2020",7/10,"Set primarily in the 80s, 'The Lives Of Others (2006)' tells the story of a writer who finds himself on the wrong side of the East German government via the man whom has been assigned to listen into his every word. The movie is interesting in that we're essentially watching someone watch someone. Each story can only exist within the context of the other, which leads to a complex and mature experience that touches on resonant themes of privacy, loneliness and personal freedom. The protagonist is a bit of a blank slate. However, as he slowly becomes more and more invested in the lives of those he monitors, he definitely undergoes a full character arc. The movie itself is often surprisingly suspenseful, brilliantly constructed to eek the most out of each potential moment of tension. Its main asset is, I suppose, its natural dramatic irony, which is used wonderfully throughout. Sometimes, the thing is a little too slow for its own good. It also has an extended denouement that seeps the life out of its otherwise superb climax. These final moments do provide a nice bit of closure but they mostly recycle old information and don't feel efficient at all. The decision to end on, essentially, a joke is questionable, too. Still, the piece is an entertaining and effective thriller overall. 7/10"
bobbie-16,"Sep 27, 2007",3/10,"Remember Total Recall? The sci-fi movie about people who get memory implants? Looks like that just happened to the viewers of The Lives of Others (LOO) , who are now convinced they know all about the GDR.  It was always cloudy.  Everybody wore either a uniform or tasteful clothes in muted shades of gray, blue, or brown.  The streets were empty.  Only two kinds of people lived theredissident artists and police spies.  There was a major shortage of women.  Everyone spoke in a flat, lifeless way (flat and lifeless--in Berlin??).  Nobody ever wore red or put on ugly flowered polyester shirts, nor did they raise kids, go to bars, shop for cold cuts, play miniature golf, or listen to Elvis Presley.Of course, as soon as you think about this, you realize that the movie is not about a real country at all, but about one of those abstract, generic totalitarian dystopias1984 (Winston and Julia ratting on each other), Minority Report, bits of Star Wars (the slimy toad-monster molesting Princess Leah) and above all, THX 1138, with gray hairless people grimly marching along gray sunless corridors while security forces keep flawless records on everybody. In other words, LOO creates a montage of spliced, recycled images from sci-fi movies to implant a generic image of ""the totalitarian state"" in our minds as our ""memory"" of the GDR.If we accused the director of playing games with these images, he would probably respond disingenuously that he made a movie about a state of mind and not a historical documentary. Funny though how many people (to judge from the reviews) believe that now they know something about the GDR. Well, what's wrong with a false memory, as long as it's anti-communist?And on the subject of falsehoods, take a look at a little sleight of hand the director tries to pull:: 1) The protagonist is understandably unhappy about the suicide of his friend. 2) The GDR did stop publishing suicide statistics (actually even earlier than 1977, as is discussed in a 1972 Radio Free Europe research report that you can see online). 3) Before the GDR stopped publishing the figures, it had a very high rate, probably the second highest in Europe after Hungary. So far, so good, but now keep your eyes open as the rabbit is pulled out of the hat! So it logically follows that the communist regime caused the high suicide rate-- right? Wait a minute! This conclusion is a logical non sequitur and a misrepresentation of historical facts. The regions comprising the GDR (especially Saxony, Prussia, and Mecklenburg, with Brandenburg not far behind) already had some of the highest suicide rates in Europe as early as the period from the 1860s to the 1880s, when these data were first systematically made available. The rate in Saxony (think Dresden and Chemnitz) was consistently the highest in Europe throughout this period. But these historical and sociological facts might inconveniently interfere with the simple anti-communist message.Don't worry, I am not about to undertake the Herculean task of defending the GDRand indeed there was a lot not to like. But if you really want to know something about it, not just wallow in feel-good anti-Communism, see Goodbye, Lenin, an infinitely better movie than LOO. Two negative perspectives, but both of them more serious than LOO, are Jan Schutte's Abschied/Farewell: Brecht's Last Summer and Peter Kahane's The Architects, about a group of young urban planners. And try some GDR movies, many of which had a more critical and humorous edge than you might expect, such as Egon Gunther's Der Dritte, a comedy about a slatternly, feisty single mom and bus cleaner. Yes, ordinary working people actually existed, rode on buses, drank beer, ate cold cuts, went to jobs, raised kids, enjoyed sex, and stood up to their bosses (the chronic labor shortage allowed workers to be far less subservient at the workplace than the ""free"" and pathetically insecure American employee has to be). The subject of the relative autonomy and equality of women is way to big to get intoChrista-Maria's limp victim-hood was not typicalyou can check this out in Christel Lane's article on women in the GDR in Sociology, Volume 17, no. 4, November,1989.Bottom line on LOO: Don't believe everything you see; and you will see disappointingly little of the very attractive Sebastian Koch, whose talents are wasted in a glum and sexless part.."
Xstal,"Jan 15, 2023",9/10,"Just who do these people think they are! There are rules that must be followed, you can't ignore, all the free thinking thespians, these directors and their friends, in this democracy, we must be strong, and reprehend. Through surveillance we will bring the curtain down, say something wrong, there'll be severe clamping down, you won't know that we're here, but eyes and ears are everywhere, you cannot win, and we're quite confident you'll adhere.Ulrich Mühe provides an outstanding performance as the cold-hearted, regimented state official, brainwashed by the corrupt communist machine over many years, who develops an attachment to those he sees as subversive and threatening, when they open up a channel to his soul through the wires he uses to probe theirs.I revisited this after watching Seberg, the story of how Jean Seberg was spied upon during the late sixties and early seventies. There's a federal agent who develops a conscience in that too - the main difference being that it takes place in the so called land of the free."

filmbuff1974,"Jan 25, 2007",10/10,I won't go into the plot.The film concerns East Germany during the eighties at it's most oppressive.The film is engrossing and so absorbing that I forgot I was reading subtitles all through it.Well worth the evening. The Lives of Others is what film is supposed to do which is to make one think about one's life and the society one is living in.I should say that the promotional poster is very misleading and I fear it will hurt this outstanding film.Those nude couples is absolutely not what this film is about.This is not some film about a group of self-absorbed adults jumping in and out of beds to put some excitement into their dull lives.This is a political film involving adults who are trying to live life freely in a very oppressive environment.The publicists should really re-think their promotional campaign.
ferryleblanc,"Nov 20, 2009",9/10,"I have already found a lot of useful comments on this film, so my intention is not to repeat those comments. For me, this movie was really good, so I am a follower of the positive reviews I have read.What I would like to do, is comment on the negative reviews I have read about the character development, and in particular the role of Ulrich Muhe (Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler).A lot of people state that the transition from a very strict Stasi agent to the helpful 'friend' isn't realistic and human. When you look at how extremely strict and haunting the man was beforehand, he just couldn't turn into a good guy all of a sudden, they say.I disagree with that. When you look at it from a psychological point of view, it makes clear sense to me. It is very well known that just before a person admits his wrongdoing, he is at his most extreme in denying it! The more he is confronted with the fact that his methods are unethical, the more he will try to find arguments to defend his methods. A great example of this is the scene where the student in Wiesler's class comments on the brutal interrogations Wiesler has pulled off. Wiesler answers by saying that this is just the way things go in the DDR, and that the student better get used to that.Another example of why the transformation of Wiesler is so credible, is the fact that he hasn't got a life of his own. This is perfectly illustrated by the scenes in Wiesler's home. Every evening he returns to his home, finding it empty. He cooks (awefull) for himself and orders prostitutes to satisfy his sexual needs. In that particular scene he even asks the prostitute to stay longer. This illustrates even more how lonely the poor guy is. Also, this loneliness and 'lack of own life' perfectly illustrate the title of this movie. Wiesler doesn't have a life of his own, and therefore 'lives the life of others' when he's sitting in the attic listening to the lives that happen beneath him.A final argument for the credibility of the transition is the piano play Georg Dreyman plays after his good friend, the director and writer Albert Jerska, dies: 'die Sonate vom guten Menschen' or 'The sonata of good people'. This is the key moment for the transition. Wiesler then perfectly realizes that his work is pointless and unethical. That by doing it, he will never become a good man, and will never have a worthy life of his own. He is confronted with the rich life of the poets and artists, and discovers how beautiful a normal and free life can be. From that point on, he changes radically, and decides that he is no longer a part of an unethical, inhuman system. To me, this all perfectly fits.In my opinion this is one of the best movie in years. And I hope that I have offered clear arguments on why the transformation of Wiesler is not a wrong and unrealistic move, but instead a great enrichment of the movie."
Hitchcoc,"Feb 22, 2016",10/10,"The Cold War is the center of all this. We were guilty of allowing the division of Germany and the splitting of the city of Berlin. What transpired was a Soviet controlled city with as many informants as citizens (exaggeration, but not that great a one). Of course, the true journalist is going to be the first to go. Don't say anything against the government. The focuses of this film is a young author who has to keep a low profile, and a man who lives right next to him, whose job is to use heavy surveillance on him. Eventually, this man begins to realize the results of his actions and he tries to pull back his invasiveness. The scariest part of this film involves the tactics used to get confessions out of those singled out. Of course, when they can't get to the person, they threaten their wives and children. Of course, since this takes place in 1980, we are in the wake of the destruction of the Berlin Wall. Everyone should see this and think about its implications. There is alo a subtlety and a reserved presentation that makes this work well."
colinmetcalfe,"Feb 5, 2010",10/10,"Some really average films get held up as classics nowadays - but here we have a genuine classic.Everything works together and supports the story, no over indulgent 'David Leanesque' camera shots; no over-the-top performances from any of the actors. Okay, maybe a little sentimental in parts, but by then you are completely sucked in by the performances and the story so it doesn't matter.I implore all film lovers, who haven't seen this movie to do so immediately and if you don't think it is one of the best films ever made - to quote Ron Burgundy: 'I will fight you and that's no lie!'"
cfbten,"Sep 2, 2015",N/A,"Usually when I'm in a cinema at some point my attention wanders to the ceiling and/or the audience. Not so during The Lives of Others! I was held spellbound throughout by the mesmeric quality of writing,acting and direction. OK, so it had English subtitles. But it mattered not one wit.And yet,ask your friends, however in-the-know they think they are, what they thought of it and 90% will wonder what on earth you are referring to. How sad.It should be mandatory viewing for UK Sixth Form students, so chillingly does it convey the life-draining claustrophobia and fear endemic in a police state. If you missed this gem in the cinema, do,do get the DVD."
SnoopyStyle,"Jan 17, 2015",8/10,"It's 1984 East Germany. The state's secret police Stasi is an ever knowing presence. Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is an expert interrogator and teacher. Playwright Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland are loyal artistic stars. Wiesler zeros in on Wiesler and fascinated by Christa. Wiesler bugs his apartment and spies on them from the cellar. Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf lusts after Christa and coerces her into having sex. Wiesler insinuates himself into their lives by pushing her back with Dreyman. Meanwhile, Dreyman is trying to defend his writer friend Jerska but he is helpless against Hempf. When Jerska commits suicide, Dreyman secretly writes a letter denouncing the state.This movie shows the police state as an everyday thing which is somehow more compelling and haunting. The movie is filled with greys and more greys. The character Wiesler is such a great interior person. For such a quiet character, he is able to build up so much emotion. The movie lays down a convincing foundation and constructs these human characters."
dancohenWPB,"Jun 13, 2020",10/10,I can't say enough good things about this movie and I can't believe I owned it for this long without watching it. It's an amazing piece of art and historical fiction. Even close to 15 years later it's still feels relevant and fresh. Simply beautiful and a power reminder of how good cinema can be.
david-arnaud,"Feb 16, 2013",10/10,"I highly recommend this trip into old world Germany. It takes you on a ride of intense empathy that few films do. It's brilliantly acted by almost everyone, with some truly memorable performances from both lead and supplemental characters. It's elegantly written by a true artist who realizes he can successfully avoid any manufactured drama and let the setting of his story address those essential cinematic needs. It feels as real as a movie can as a result. This movie will stay with you and make you feel thankful for what you have. My only wish would be a slightly higher pace to the story in the first half of the movie...if only more movies had such few things wrong with it though."
the_weirdo,"Jan 8, 2010",9/10,"I am a huge fan of German intellect. Their Philosophy. Their Literature. Their Science. One thing relating to the Germans that I am not that big a fan of is their entertainment. And my impression is mostly limited to the free television progammes they offer and honestly I get verily bored by those when I stay there.But with so much hype associated with this movie (being included in most of the top 10 lists of movies after 2000), I couldn't resist my curiosity and decided to go for it. I am so wrong about German movies. This one in particular is definitely one of the best movies I have seen.Before the Germany reunification, East Germany had this totalitarian government that was accused of infringing privacy of the citizens putting them into 24 hours surveillance to monitor any anti-government activities. The story involves an interrogation and surveillance specialist STASI (State Security) officer given a task of monitoring the life of a writer. But soon he discovers the misuse of power of the higher officials for personal benefit and his faith in the system withers down. And more he listens to the life of others he gets slowly absorbed in their lives living it with them. But the question was how far he could go?The direction is absorbing. The performance of the actors are fantastic. Remember 'The Green Mile'? This movie grips you like that one. It starts slow but becomes so engaging that it drags audience into the movie living with the actors. I was moved and intrigued with the dilemma each character was facing. I was living the lives of others.(Originally posted @ weirdo-on-movies.blogspot.com)"
guyincognito1,"Nov 29, 2011",9/10,"This is an absolutely fantastic film, with a very suitable soundtrack and great performances from the whole cast, which performs perfectly.Little things, like facial expressions, reactions, etc. are so important on the big screen, and are so difficult to get right. It says a lot for the talent on set that this film was an absolute joy to watch, especially as all these 'little things' were executed to perfection. As Wiesler grows to love his subjects, it is, of course, a gradual change, and Ulrich Muehe, with the help of a tender and fantastic script, pulls his character off so convincingly.What is very interesting about this film is the way in which it portrays West Germany. Von Donnersmarck has not directed a love-letter to the West; he portrays its faults just as he portrays those of the East, and of the Ministerium fuer Staatssicherheit (Stasi), and there are some very thought-provoking issues and ideas within the film.Ultimately, whether the right thing is done or not, a transformation occurs within the film, one for a more fulfilling existence. I'll leave you to decide whether or not it is for the better, but I truly believe that this film is an enriching experience for all who watch it. You really get the sense that the actors cared for the themes and issues that the film raised, and this can only ever make a film better.The film is not without tension, which is expertly tackled by fast editing and music, and not without sadness, loss, and pain. Characters are more deeply explored than you first realize, and, often, they are not so different. They are, after all, all socialists.Not often does one come across a classic film, one with just the right amount of classiness, messages, and imagery, amongst other things, and it is a genuine pleasure when one falls into your lap. Watch this film. I promise that you will not be disappointed."
emdonald,"Feb 4, 2007",10/10,"This is an incredible film. I had heard nothing about it until a friend suggested we take a look. I entered the cinema without a clue what it was about and whether it was going to be any good. It turned out to be stupendously good. The characters were brilliantly wholesome and the story was lacking in nothing.The film is set in the 1980's in Germany and details the lives of those living under the regime in East Germany, focusing on some of the more ""controversial"" types in society; namely artists, play writes and actors. The relationships really tug at your heart and the turn of events is entirely unexpected.I cannot believe that there is so little written about it but suggest that you see it now."
akash_sebastian,"Sep 1, 2012",9/10,"A creepy and innovative political thriller, set in a shadowy period in recent German history. With a run-time of over 2 hours, the film doesn't let you take your eyes off even for a single momentOther than Donnersmarck's brilliant direction, the movie's fascinating and morally complex characters, acted out flawlessly by the three leads, keep you involved right from the beginning.(Note: Though there might be a few historical inaccuracies, like the Stasi security might not have been that severe in 1984 exactly, but may have existed much before it, and many others. So, the movie should be seen as a work of fiction, not some historical account.)Deeds done out of good intentions always pay off; even if they don't, you're free from any sort of guilt or regret which might follow if you had done it the other way -A Must-watch!"
chickpeamicky,"Sep 3, 2011",N/A,"A really fascinating story of a world I knew little about. Well told by all players, this film is a great depiction of the human capacity for love, bravery, forgiveness and change under such a harsh regime. There is very little I can say other than you should definitely put this on your list.Along with last year's 'Let The Right One In', 'The Lives Of Others' is an excellent example of how great films from around the world can have a broad appeal. It has further encouraged me to more frequently explore foreign cinema. I hope it does you too. Let's just hope there are no plans by Hollywood to remake this.

The characters and the tension between them was facinating, and it felt like the story could go in any direction at any given time.

badpritt,"Jan 5, 2009",10/10,"Dear Hollywood,would you mind watching this tremendous work and finally learn that to shock your audience you don't need a gun blowing someone's head off. You need an actor raising his eye brow, a single look, a simple movement of her hand. Yes, I know, you can't sell a movie around the world if you can't make sure anyone of any cultural background will get what is meant to be expressed. Yes, blowing someone's head off makes clear the poor fellow is dead and the other guy is evil and ruthless and needs to be tracked down. Yes, taxi driver is a fantastic masterpiece. But did it really have to end in a massacre?It is subtlety that turns a movie with good actors and good plot into an incredible one. The Lives of Others is pure subtlety. I hope it will never be forgotten."
asda-man,"Aug 16, 2011",9/10,"Films like ""The Lives of Others"" don't come around very often, as the film industry is dominated by loud Hollywood blockbusters with no real substance (Helena Bonham Carter would agree with me :) this, an overlooked film because it's foreign and quieter than dominating films, deserves a much wider audience. Anyone could watch ""The Lives of Others"" and be touched and perhaps moved by the wonderful acting and deeply drawn out characters (unless you're under 5, but we'll let you off!)If you appreciate fine acting, this is a great film to watch. Because in foreign films you can't understand what they're saying (generally) I usually find it difficult to tell if they're acting well or not, but in ""The Lives of Others"" you can tell that they're delivery and performance is fantastic. Right down to the main characters walk! It also helps it to flesh out the wonderfully drawn characters. They're in-depth and you find yourself being emotionally attached to them as the Stasi man watching them! You increasingly want to see more of them making for truly compelling viewing!The directing also adds to how compelling the film is. It's very delicate and clever in the way he tries only to show the couple in the way Wiesler also sees them, so when his shift is over, we as an audience also stop seeing the family which helps us to understand how Wiesler is so compelled with their lives and also makes it exceedingly gripping! Although, I think that the directing could've afforded to be more intense than it was, but that's only a small flaw.The writing is incredibly intelligent and also gives you good insight to the split Germany before the Berlin wall came down. It's interesting and moving with a very touching ending. The screenplay also doesn't fear about delving deeply into the characters either. It's full of excellent characterisation and brings up some delicate themes in the correct manner.""The Lives of Others"" is a truly masterful film, every element that makes a classic film comes together perfectly. I can bet that in 50 years time ""The Lives of Others"" will still be watched and cherished. It's just a shame it doesn't get the recognition it deserves! Even if you don't feel that ""The Lives of Others"" isn't your thing, please just give it a go and I bet that'll you'll be moved and compelled by the experience. A must see!"

A man working for such an organization can be A GOOD MAN (moral,compassionate,human,unbiased,tolerant....) ? How many of them they had a conscience ? It is hard to say that agent (whatever his codename was) is torn by guilt , conscience or simply love for beautiful actress . Who knows ? For me that is an enigma . More people who voted positively for this movie are from eastern Europe ; is normal they witnessed those events (as myself) you can forget those times , with bad things , good things filtered of course by personal opinion and personal experience . I did not know then the time flew , I was enthralled , enchanted , even if I kind of had guessed some things they gonna end up bad . A very moving and humane movie !"

As one who live in such a country, I think this movie is a masterpiece and Ulrich Muhe made a brilliant role, and maybe he's the man who should win the Oscar this year. In a world full of suspicion and secret services entering every people's life, the STASI officer risks his job for a noble cause, which the communists hated at that time - THE CULTURE. A really amazing production and a page of history ""written"" with genius by the crew of this film. Congratulations !"
tedg,"Jun 9, 2008",N/A,"Regular readers of my comments know I go on and on about noir and folding. When I see these narrative techniques used, I often remark that the technique is wasted, because the film has no heft once it has charmed us into investing in it.Not so here. The thing we get from this is simple, the value of passion in art. We get it viscerally and it matters. The basic device is as usual, commitment to art as a commitment to a lover. We also get the common technique of mapping personal challenge into political challenge because you can ""show"" it.The folding here is complex. Our watcher in the story is literally a watcher. We are getting a film written by the filmmaker that features a play and ultimately a book by the main character. The watcher and writer have other watchers, and indeed the woman has other attention concerning performance. We have writing or performing (in life, in sex, piano, play...) at every fold. Its very tight in its construction and effective at what it sets out to do.Quite apart from that, its timeliness in the US is apt. The subtitles I saw translated the spies as ""National Security Agency,"" which as every American now knows performs very similar surveillance on its citizens, also without controls, and also for political purpose. So it chills.Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."
kenjha,"Oct 27, 2007",6/10,"This much-praised film tells the story of a celebrity couple in East Germany being spied on by the government. Koch and Gedeck are too subdued as the couple but Muhe gives a fine performance as the man who listens in on the couple's wire-tapped apartment. The problem is that the film moves very slowly and goes on too long. While the basic premise of the story is interesting, von Donnersmarck (great name!) does little to enliven the film or tap into the potential for suspense. A more talented director could have made this into a fine thriller. A couple of key plot elements are too contrived and some of the actions of characters are unexpected and left unexplained."

The Minister of Culture Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) and former lover of Christa orders the ambitious Chief of Police Anton Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur) to find evidences that Georg is not loyal to the party to get rid off him and stay with Christa, and the efficient agent Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to conduct surveillance on Georg's apartment. Wiesler does not find any evidence that could compromise Georg, until the day of his blacklisted friend and director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) commits suicide. Georg decides to write an anonymous article to Der Spiegel about the hidden numbers of suicides in East Germany. However, Wiesler becomes fascinated with the lives and thoughts of George and Christa and covers his findings from his superiors.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is another powerful German movie, showing the repressing and corrupted system supported by fear in East Germany in times of Cold War. This movie is practically perfect: the screenplay and story are engaging, disclosing a triangle of love that causes a political surveillance of an innocent man based on several characters that are perfectly developed. The pace is neither slow nor fast but very adequate, and uses an awesome cinematography. Therefore the work of the director and writer Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck is outstanding. The performances are top-notch, but the actor Ulrich Mühe is amazingly perfect, deserving an Oscar, and Martina Gedeck gives a great credibility to her abused character. I usually watch many movies , but ""Das Leben der Anderen"" is certainly among the best recent movies I have seen, if not the best. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""A Vida dos Outros"" (""The Life of the Others"")"
jtindahouse,"Mar 12, 2025",6/10,"There are two types of films that typically make it into the IMDb Top 250. Extremely inventive or entertaining films that critics may not love as much, like 'The Usual Suspects'. Then there are films that are unarguably well made and hit all the right points, but aren't very fun to watch. 'The Lives of Others' is the latter. It's smart and it hits all the right notes along the way, but it ultimately feels empty.As you're watching you keep thinking, ahh yes very clever, very clever, that was smart, oh I liked that. But then all you want is the film to knock you over with an impossibly powerful moment, or do something that just takes your breathe away. And it never comes. The film does try to do this actually with a certain scene near the end, but it fell very flat for me.I will say I absolutely loved the final line in the movie. That was well done and as a lasting impression on your audience is probably a reason the film is rated so highly. For me it wasn't enough though. 6/10."
Galina_movie_fan,"Sep 24, 2007",10/10,"""The Lives of Others"", the 2007 very deserving Oscar winner for the Best Foreign Film is IMO, the best film of last year regardless of the country it was made in. It took its writer/director several years first to thoroughly research still very painful events of the recent German history, the ones that deal with infamous and evil STASI (State Secret Police) and how it infiltrated and affected almost every aspect of GDR life. Before the collapse of the Soviet system and its most ominous and infamous symbol, the wall in the end of the 80s, life in East Germany of 1984 had imitated art precisely like in the prophetic and terrifying George Orwell's novel. Each citizen could have and majority were closely monitored by STASI which motto was ""Shield and Sword of the Party"" and its goal, ""To know everything"". By the time East Germany collapsed in 1989, STASI employed an estimated 91,000 employees and 300,000 informants; about one in fifty East Germans collaborated with the powerful and Omni-present Secret Police, one of the most extensive infiltrations of a police apparatus in history. The STASI monitored political behavior among GDR citizens, and is known to have used torture and intimidation to mute, corrupt, and destroy dissent. Even those who believed they were above suspicion due to their closeness to the prominent members of the government were not safe. The film explores the lives of those who watched and listened and those on the other side of the wire.I was shocked to find out that such astounding movie was a directorial debut of 33 years old Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck - so artistically impeccable this honest, human, horrifying, harrowing yet hopeful film is. The film makers had recreated successfully and precisely the 1980s with its dark suffocating atmosphere of constant abuse of individual privacy in the former German Democratic republic. The locations, the huge dominating gray apartment buildings of the big city where every wall seems to have the ears and the eyes , the old cars on the streets of East Berlin  everything looks, sounds, and feels authentically . As great as ""The Lives of Others is"", it would not have been the same without Ulrich Mühe, as Captain Gerd Wiesler, a highly skilled and efficient STASI officer and a loyal member of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, who spies on successful playwright and his actress girlfriend by the order of corrupted hypocritical member of the government. While listening to the Lives of Others, Wiesler's own life would change in the way he had never expected.Once you start watching the movie, you'll see how Ulrich Mühe effortlessly over towers every other performance on the screen, and they are all excellent. The real life of Ulrich Mühe could make a great and compelling movie and the script for ""The Lives of Others"" was written with him in mind. He was born, grew up, and became a famous actor in the Eastern Germany back in the late 70s of the last century. By the words of von Donnersmarck, STASI began spying on Mühe right after he had graduated from High School because STASI realized that he would be great even before he himself realized that. After German reunification, Mühe discovered evidence in his STASI file that he had been under surveillance not only by four of his fellow actors in the East Berlin theater, but also by his second wife, Jenny Gröllmann. This was denied by Gröllmann who, after an acrimonious and highly-publicized court case, succeeded in obtaining an injunction to prevent Mühe from repeating the allegation in a book. Mühe's response when asked how he prepared for his role in Das Leben der Anderen was simple, ""I remembered"". Mühe passed away few months ago, in July 2007 due to stomach cancer at the age or 54, and when I read it, I felt emptiness - like a very good close friend has gone forever. His performance in the film ""The Lives of Others"" will live always as one of the best and most memorable given by any actor of the screen."
ajs-10,"Aug 14, 2011",9/10,"I remember when this came out it got quite a lot of critical acclaim. Of course it never made it to a cinema near me and so when it came up in the TV listings it became a 'must see' for me. I'm really glad I saw it, it's somewhat different to what I was expecting (in a good way). I know there are a few out there that are afraid of subtitles, so I should tell you that yes, it's in German with subtitles. For me, this isn't a problem, but with a long film (as this is), I find I sometimes have to take a break to rest the brain for a few minutes. I found it to be a really engaging drama that has some truly powerful scenes and some great performances. Here's a brief summary before I give you my thoughts.It is East Germany in 1984, five years before the Berlin wall would fall. The East German people are constantly watched by the secret police, The Stasi. Anyone deemed to have strayed from the party line was arrested and interrogated. They could even end up in jail. When playwright, Georg Dreyman comes under the spotlight of the Stasi, at the behest of party official, Minister Bruno Hempf, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is assigned the case. Dreyman's apartment is bugged and Wiesler begins to listen to the comings and goings in the flat. Dreyman lives with his girlfriend, actress, Christa-Maria Sieland, who has a big part to play in the events that unfold. As time goes by, Wiesler begins to empathise with those he's listening to. He realises that not everything has to be reported, to the extent that he even scales down the operation so he alone reports on the couple. He uses this position to protect them when Dreyman begins to do things the party really wouldn't like. I will leave my summary here so as not to be subjected to a 48 hour interrogation by them Spoiler Police.This is a very well made film, although I did find the surroundings very stark, but then again, I guess that's just realism. Great performances all round, particularly from Ulrich Mühe who played the rather serious Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler with great dignity. I thought Sebastian Koch as Georg Dreyman and Martina Gedeck as Christa-Maria Sieland were both superb. Ulrich Tukur did a good job as Wiesler's boss, Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz, as did Thomas Thieme as the loathsome Minister Bruno Hempf.I was surprised how much emotion was brought out both in, and by, this film. In the end it becomes a very heart-warming story. The beginning, on the other hand, I found really hard to follow, but once it settled down it was much easier. It has a slow, deliberate pace, but I didn't find it a chore to watch. I did find it was a little long though, but the extra scenes at the end are a real pay-off. So, if you're not scared of subtitles, and you can spare 137 minutes, then this one comes highly RECOMMENDED.My Score: 8.5/10.IMDb Score: 8.5/10 (based on 93,806 votes when this review was written).Rotten Tomatoes Score: 93/100 (based on 150 reviews counted when this review was written)."
intelearts,"Jan 1, 2008",10/10,"It is rare to see a film that is so totally convincing as Das Leben der Anderen.The movie focuses on Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), and the wiretapping of Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a famed author, and actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck).The whole film from the architecture to the furniture is beautifully bought to life.But much more than that is the sense of menace through the banal that the film draws you into.Extraordinary performances by all involved, wonderfully understated and suppressed and controlled, and the overall washed-out tones add to the surreality of a world whether you are either a listener or listened to.A perfect paranoia for all involved the film unfolds and builds with a tremendous sense of pace. For a film this long it is beautifully handled.Of course, the film is about the need for freedom, but that sells it way short; perhaps, it is more truthfully a film about good in unexpected places.Definitely deserves its Oscar: one of the outstanding films of German cinema, and for my money the best German film since Das Boot and Run Lola, Run.Hugely recommended."
silverdragon4,"Apr 30, 2014",9/10,"Just finished watching this film and I have to say it was fantastic. I'm a man that watches all sorts of films. Sci-fi, comedy, fantasy, action etc. But I rarely watch European cinema or subtitled films. But this...it blew me away at how good it was.The acting by all the cast was great, Martina Gedeck, Sebastian Koch...just brilliant, but Ulrich Mühe, top performance as the Stasi officer.I don't want to add spoilers, but I I will say this, Out of the thousands of films I've seen, this is one of the best! A must watch for anyone, even if you don't usually watch subtitled films!"
Vartiainen,"May 5, 2018",6/10,"A Stasi trainer, Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe), is ordered to place a famous play writer Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) under constant surveillance. The orders come from the highest echelons of the government, but Wiesler slowly begins to understand that the motives for them may not be as patriotic as they should. And at the same time the life of these two content souls begins to lure him in.Despite this film being just over a decade old, it feels much older. And in this case that works in the film's favour, giving it an authentic feel, like it could have happened right there and then. it gives the film weight, which is good, because Stasi and their human right violations are some of the darkest aspects of East German history. And yet, at the same time the film tries to shy away from black and white moralizing. Wiesler's character, despite being a high-ranking Stasi officer, is not a monster, does posses a soul and certainly has his sympathetic moments. This has apparently caused certain amount of controversy, some believing that Stasi and its legacy should be shown no mercy, no sympathy. Which seems uncomfortably harsh to me.Then again, I was only a few months old when the Berlin Wall came down. For me, this is history, something that happened in the distant past. It's funny for me to think that the events of this film took place when my parents were teenagers or young adults. The world has certainly changed since then.For me this film is more interesting than it is good. Certainly it's acted well and directing is superb, but it still seems more like a gateway into a subject, a conversation starter, rather than a great movie in its own right."
willyclassof66,"Dec 28, 2007",10/10,"The suspicion of the Eastern Germany's Stasi and the depression inflicted on the creative intelligentsia is incredibly well-portrayed. Even though I remember the tearing down of the Berlin Wall and celebrating the joy of freedom and democracy, I had no real comprehension of the deceitfulness, suspicion, and depression that was so prevalent in Eastern Germany.This movie presents and excellent portrayal of how the weak were forced to sacrifice their morals, but it also The sacrifice of morals by the weak, but it also showed redeeming qualities of even some of the most despicable members of the Stasi.The unexpected ending of the movie is well worth the two hour and 15 minute wait."
Nexelium,"Feb 26, 2025",7/10,"The Lives of Others is a powerful drama about total surveillance, espionage, and the transformation of personal convictions under the weight of an oppressive system. The film presents the grim reality of East Germany in the 1980s, where anyone's private life could be scrutinized by the state at any moment.The protagonist, Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, initially appears to be the perfect instrument of the regime. However, as he monitors playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, he begins to empathize with them, realizing how empty and meaningless his own existence has become. The film's central message is clear: a life spent spying on others is a life devoid of personal meaning.The plot is relatively simple, but its minimalism allows the audience to grapple with profound questions about power, morality, and the essence of human existence. The film raises timeless concerns: how far can state control go, and where is the line between duty and humanity?One of the film's greatest strengths is its outstanding performances. Ulrich Muhe delivers a deeply nuanced portrayal of Wiesler, brilliantly capturing his inner turmoil and gradual transformation from a devoted officer into a man capable of compassion.The Lives of Others leaves behind a haunting silence. It lacks dramatic twists, yet its atmosphere and masterful storytelling are deeply compelling. This is not just a film about politics-it is a film about people, about freedom, and about the price one must pay for it."
Luigi Di Pilla,"May 28, 2007",5/10,I heard from my friend and from the press that DAS LEBEN DER ANDEREN is a must see. I am surprised that it had such a great success inclusive the Oscar for the best foreign language movie. The story hits no doubt a very important theme of nowadays that let even me a little bit shocked at the end. The running time therefore is too long and some scenes too slow paced that could have been cut. The sceneries and the atmosphere took me really back at the end of the eighties years. The actors especially Ulrich Mühe did a great job. For all these reasons I give with my wife a solid 5/10. I think it's too overrated on this site. If you liked it I recommend the other German documentation DER UNTERGANG that is much more thrilling and not so boring as THE LIVES OF THE OTHERS.
Asa_Nisi_Masa2,"May 4, 2007",9/10,"A deserving Oscar winner if ever there was one, though I was never one to pay special attention to the Oscars, I was almost shocked by how perfect this debut movie by a 34-year-old director very nearly was. Set in East Berlin in the mid-80s, some five years before the infamous Wall crumbled, it follows the STASI as they plot to find incriminating evidence against playwright Georg Dreyman, who'd been the regime's darling until a ruthless minister frivolously develops a lecherous desire to possess his girlfriend, renowned stage actress Christa-Maria Sieland. Though both Sebastian Koch (last seen by me as the Nazi Captain Müntze in Verhoeven's Black Book) and Martina Gedeck are excellent as the central couple trapped within the STASI's web of eavesdropping and paranoia tactics, the real hero and star of the movie is without a doubt Ulrich Mühe. I had last seen in Michael Haneke's Funny Games, where he played Georg, the unfortunate husband and dad who comes to a sticky end. In The Lives of Others, Mühe memorably fills the shoes of the STASI agent Gerd Wiesler who listened to Dreyman's daily life through the bugs in his flat. Balding, physically non-descript Wiesler conveys more with one subtle shift of an eyeball than the whole stellar cast of an Oliver Stone movie. This actor is so charismatic, he blows even the undeniably talented and handsome Sebastian Koch clear off the screen. In this movie not only are things seldom what they seem, but humanity and redemption can be found in the most ridiculously unexpected places.Shocking, humane and moving yet never predictable, heavy-handed or melodramatic, the movie is also blessed by a solid script, a very plausible storyline free of plot holes and an immaculately researched scenario. I've read that both the movie's director and Mühe remember their experiences living in the Communist regime. Though the former was still very young, he claims to clearly remember the climate of paranoia he grew up in, while Mühe later discovered that he had been spied upon by his own wife! Oddly enough, one accusation levelled against the movie by some IMDb reviewers is that of misogyny. Being normally very sensitive to a discriminatory portrayal of women, I was very baffled by this. I've come to the conclusion that some touchy viewers expect their movie characters  especially those of women or ethnic minorities  to be paragons of virtue or role models, rather than simply human beings with flaws and plausible weaknesses. In my view Christa-Maria's main sin was not to be ""weak"", as some other viewers here claim, but simply ""human"". If anything, the movie also provided a damning portrait of the brutality of the regime against women.Perhaps my only, very minor complaint with the movie was its ending, which felt a tad rushed - though it was a beautiful ending all the same - uplifting and sad, poetic and yet also grounded in the starkest reality."
RJBurke1942,"Mar 21, 2008",10/10,"While the credits begin to roll, and as Captain Wiesler's (Ulrich Müle) face - transformed by muted joy - fades to black, I pondered, for a long time, the sheer brilliance of this finely crafted narrative from an equally brilliant first-time writer/producer/director, Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck.This film is positive proof that, for the most part, it is the story that makes or breaks. That's not to say this film is without flaw; but, I'll come to that below.Fade in starts in 1984 - a nicely ironic touch, I thought, given that the setting is the police state of the GDR  East Germany before the Berlin Wall came down. Wiesler is employed as an interrogator with the East German State Police, or Stasi. In the first few minutes, you witness his cold, calculated finesse in destroying a prisoner's claims of innocence. So also, you learn that Wielser is as cold as the state that produced him, perhaps colder than the concrete walls that house the hapless prisoners. Real joy is apparently beyond Wiesler's ken; his only smile is when he knows he's trapped his prisoner in a tissue of lies.His superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), knowing Wiesler's expertise, gives him a new task: dig up some dirt on one of the state's favorite sons  Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright and novelist of international repute who still manages to toe most of the Party line. Or does he?Grubitz, however, has a hidden agenda: he wants damaging evidence against Dreyman because his superior, the lecherous Minister Bruno Hempf (Thomas Thieme) lusts after Dreyman's girl friend, Christa-Maria (Martina Gedek), a well-known and acclaimed stage actress. Wiesler, initially unaware of that tangle, jumps at the chance because he knows such a high-profile case will help his career along. Or so he thinks...Hence, Dreyman's apartment is bugged and then monitored by Wiesler and his assistant, Udo (Charly Hübner), from a hidden loft at the top of the apartment block; and so 24/7, they begin to listen to the everyday lives of others. And, in doing so, something happens to Wiesler: he becomes interested, curious, inquiring, concerned and finally involved directly. Thus, his transformation from a cold automaton under state socialism into an engaged and sympathetic human being begins...and is, I think, also a metaphor for the transformation of the GDR later, when the Wall comes down.These are the times that I wish I knew German better. The sub-titles, however, are very good. Hence, don't be deterred: this is an unhurried story that is told with a minimum of words with the camera in medium close-up and close-up for much of the time, thus allowing the actors to let their emotions say what words often cannot.The plot itself is completely linear, each scene naturally following, so there is little chance of confusion for the viewer. Hence, when the tension comes, you're ready for it; when an ironic twist occurs  and there are many - you immediately know why, and either smile, cry or cringe; when tragedy strikes, you almost know it was going to happen anyway. But, it is at the end, when Dreyman and Wiesler both realize, at different times, the common thread that binds them irrevocably, that the full impact of the title hits: when you come to know the lives of others, you come to know yourself for who and what you are. So only the hardest of hearts will turn away from the thrill, the sheer joy, which lights up Wiesler's face as the final scene fades to black. That ironically beautiful ending, I'm sure, will be much discussed, debated and admired for years, if not generations, to come.As Wiesler, Ulrich Müle, with a striking resemblance to Anthony Hopkins, is simply outstanding; his performance is flawless. This is his movie, no question, despite the quality of the rest of the cast. Equally, the cinematography, direction and editing are first class. Moreover, it's quite obvious also that the production was not expensive, attesting to the fact you don't need a lot of money to craft a brilliant story and film. In that regard, the Cohen brothers' first film, Blood Simple (1984) comes to mind as a (lesser) comparison.And the flaw? Perhaps not so much a flaw as two narrative quirks: why was it relatively easy, in the Dreyman case, for Wiesler to throw off years of loyalty to the party and the state? Perhaps it was just the straw that broke the camel's back? And, while listening to others' lives, why does Wiesler go to the trouble of typing up a concurrent report summary instead of using tapes to record all the conversations and do the typing later? It seemed such a backward step, operationally, because he was so used to recording his interrogations of prisoners. I have some ideas, but I'll leave you to sort out your own.Some may complain about the length (137 min); others may yawn at what they consider to be unnecessary scenes. In my opinion, however, there's not a wasted shot, frame or scene: this is filming and story telling at its best, and deservedly won the Academy Award 2007 for Best Foreign Film.As a final point, this story is  perhaps unintentionally - also an obvious and timely warning about the excesses that any state, regardless of politics, can initiate and maintain in the name of national security."
claes-bertilson,"Nov 23, 2006",10/10,"Germany has during the last few years produced a number of very worthwhile films that take stock of their somewhat chequered past. The incredible ""Untergang"" and the very funny ""Good Bye Lenin"" have to be the two most prominent ones. They have now been joined by the very classy ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others). It is a must see film for everyone, and especially those with an interest in our near history. It is this incredible to think that less than 20 years ago such totalitarian regimes existed all over Europe. It is even more disturbing to realise that they still exist in places today.Based around one surveillance case that offers many different takes on the same story ""Das Leben der Anderen"" brings home the totalitarian regime that was East Germany. It offers a great historical perspective while making you feel hope and joy. The acting is extremely good, it feels just as downplayed as I imagine life in the old DDR was. I don't imagine it will propel any of the actors to Hollowood greatness (many are already German acting veterans) but I really hope writer/director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who also co-produced the film get his due credit.It would be liberating (pardon the pun) to see this film claim top hon ours for best international film instead of the usual line up of Almodovar or Kaurismäki. Even if it doesn't, go see it."
skkane,"Dec 13, 2019",10/10,Very powerfull and emotional. It's my 5th time watching this and I still shed a tear. The ending was superb. I am not good with words but you need to watch this one.RIP Ulrich Mühe. Loved you in Funny Games as well.
gurutheja66,"Dec 5, 2013",10/10,"I am not so good at writing.But for this movie i felt like writing something good about it.And i tried to recollect the name of it after watching the one struck me is ""life for others"".I think that tells the story.I liked the characters dimensions which were dynamic through out the movie.The book which is shown in the end is really out somewhere,i hope i would read that.And i really thank IMDb for giving such gem of a movies as suggestions.And i confess that i watched this movie through online without paying.Will get a original DVD soon from stores.Danke Deutschen"
merinsaid,"Jan 11, 2016",9/10,"A powerful movie about the German history (east Germany) and the operations of the ministry for state security. The story is interesting but also compelling. On one side the stasi is watching over the society. On the other side the people try to live their life's. One of the bests scenes in the movie is the small talk between the little boy and Captain Gerd Wiesler in the elevator. By the way the performance of Ulrich Mühe, who is playing Cap. Wiesler is outstanding.I often don't agree with Oscar choices, but this time they got it damn right. And what a rewarding ending. Respect to the director and scriptwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck for this wonderful movie."
vikascoder,"Apr 7, 2013",6/10,"After watching the movie last night, I just couldn't fathom the reason why this movie is so venerated and awarded. At best its a passable account of life in the GDR serviced by a fairly decent script ruined by insipid and lifeless direction. Oh actually the script is also nothing home to write about.First the movie has absolutely no atmosphere whatsoever and each frame looks like it could be anywhere in Europe in the 50s, 60s or 2000s. Is the Stasi something to be feared? Yes we know that already but the movie never attempts to make you feel scared, or feel claustrophobic or paranoid of the environment in which everything you see or do is under the watch of some Big Brother. A key plot point of the movie brings in a comparison with Hungary. I happened to visit the the Hungarian equivalent of the Hohenschönhausen in Budapest and it made me quake in my boots when I saw the prisons there. The movie steers clear of any 'fearful' portrayal of the Stasi.Coming to the acting, Sebastian Koch as Dreyman maintains a one-note expression throughout the movie. You could never tell from his crinkly half grinning half squinting expression whether he's tense or happy or scared or what. As a result you never come to care about the predicaments of the central character. There are a couple of good performances by Ulrich Mühe as Weisler and Thomas Thieme as Minister Hempf but thats all there is to it.I couldn't really point out whether there was something wrong with the Script or the Direction in the end but ultimately it looks like it's a bit of both. A central character has a change of heart which is abrupt and I could never really point out why it occurred, considering how the initial introduction of the character was laid out. The last 10 minutes of the movie borders on the ridiculous when it spends undue amount of time to 'explain' everything that happened (or maybe Dreyman WAS stupid).All in all the movie was decent but nothing to be wowed over. When I learned that the Director of the movie also directed 'The Tourist' I was not in the least bit surprised."
bilby88,"Jun 24, 2022",10/10,"One of the finest movies ever made. So utterly lacking pretence, and almost entirely true to the reality of the time. Heart-piercing in its tenderness. God rest the soul of Ulrich Muhe, the main actor. If ever a great deed were done for the sake of humanity.... Ulrich may surely rest in peace!I'll not take a star away, because, the movie is exceptional, and wonderful. But if I had a nit to pick, it would be the 'free thinking' and even more incongruously 'free acting' character - the playwright Georg Dreyman. *Truly* believing in the system whilst somehow being a dissident? That is a bit of doublethink that was impossible in the old Socialist world, even Orwell wouldn't have penned it.But otherwise marvellous film. Marvellous."
wiredrabbit,"Dec 24, 2008",3/10,"We saw this movie as it came highly recommended. Honestly, I struggled. Normally I'll watch anything German, just for practice in listening, but this was terribly slow. The plot was not involving. Perhaps it was a bold drama that made some statement, and if that is what one is looking for than look no further. If one is looking to be enlightened or entertained, look again.Now, regarding the dramatic look into GDR, what can I say? I am not German, but I am eastern European. My family lived on the other side of the wall and we had to be very careful until the wall came down. Even now, my relatives are careful amongst the party members. Still, they are happy proud people.I have also stayed in a hotel in Berlin that was very popular East German hotel amongst party elite. Those elite had far different lives. I think the grey look of the film was pointed and did remind me of the bunker buildings so common in the east. The film showed people who would have had bright lives, in contrast to the grey.As my girlfriend pointed out, it looked like a news report and not the perception we had from her east German friends nor my relations, so we didn't find it moving."
antosdoc,"Nov 1, 2013",9/10,"A film which must obligatory be seen by anyone who claims he adores cinema. It's a masterpiece. It ends and you need at least a minute of time to realize what you have just seen! One of the five best foreign language film I ever watched. It merits of any praise. It is fully emotional and didactic in the same time. Sebastian Koch is exceptional in his role. I just don't have words for Ulrich Mühe, an excellent performance. Do not think that I exaggerate.. Just pay a visit to your nearest theater and find yourselves trapped in directing that masterly created by Florian Henckel. It is also a non-Hollywood production which proves once more that it isn't needed millions of dollars to create an outstanding by all means film.I am sure you will enjoy it.."
conlaw,"Jan 28, 2007",10/10,"This movie, though rather long, is well directed such that every frame is important. The musical score of the Prague Philharmonic Orchestra enhances the movie rather than dominating it.The acting by all cast members is excellent - no one overacts. It all seems terribly real.The movie's theme causes us to focus on how fragile our freedoms really are. The historical background is East Germany in the early to mid-1980's. The Stassi reigns supreme with the enlisted help of a multitude of informants such that no one can be trusted. One can easily imagine how North Americans have cause to worry if we continually give up our liberties for the sake of combating terrorism.It is also a movie that speaks to a European culture that is now forced to assimilate the old USSR bloc. We get new sympathy for the hell that the East Germans and for that matter the citizens of other totalitarian regimes had to endure.Yet, like in Schindler's List, the good in a man's heart ultimately triumphs. The juxtaposition of ""good man""/ ""bad man"" plays heavily throughout the film.Without any chase scene or over-the-top special effects, the film pulls off what is arguably the best thriller of the year. It is well-deserving of its Academy Award nomination for best foreign language film."
jcpf,"Apr 4, 2011",9/10,"I had heard about this this film over the years and the animation that it inspired in people had drifted in and out of my consciousness, I must watch it..and then, I did, and it surprised me, it shocked me and it stayed, like a stain on my mind, difficult to wash away, nagging with layers and meaning. An incredible study of selflessness, selfishness, sexuality, relationships and despair, and yet there is in the bleached out cinematography, and the bleached out humanity, a wisp of hope and retribution. I won't add a spoiler, but if you like, it's denouement in the real world only adds to it's tragedy and it's lingering like smoke on your clothes after a night in a bar, a memory full of the joy of experience and the pain of experience."
acnovo,"Dec 26, 2013",9/10,"I'm a big fan of German movies, I always have a feeling of a very deep and human message that they can only understand and express. This movie might be about moral dilemmas, but does moral dilemmas really exists? Do we really have a difficult decision to make when we know what's always the right thing to do? This in my point of view is the real thread of the movie, moral choices. What's the right thing to do? To who we owe a good moral act? Can we be part of something that might be immoral and feel good about it? This movie is superb! The final line of the movie almost made me cry alone in my room. Very moving story, with great actors and a superb direction. I would watch this movie again and would definitely share it with a lot of people. The Lives of Others is now one of my top 10 movies of all times."
Homer-Jay,"Aug 2, 2006",N/A,"First of all: Yes, it is a very interesting film and it is worth seeing. I think it is a good start for thinking about the DDR, I hope it is a start for ""Aufarbeitung"". There has not been a real discussion about what happened before 1989, yet.I am thankful that the film gives a kind of insight and an emotional impression. I doubt that most of the people would feel emotionally involved when reading a nonfictional book about the German Democratic Republic.There are a lot of things I could name which I liked about this film. Ulrich Mühe and Ulrich Tukur are great actors, I always enjoy watching Ulrich Mühe.I think some of the actors playing bit parts are really worth to keep in mind: Ralf Ehrlich who appears twice (he is the one who tells the joke about Honecker); Volker Michalowski who plays the expert for typewriters; Marie Gruber (she must be the one who plays the sad neighbour with the secret) and the prostitute... I cannot find the name of the actress at the IMDb.I believe other will emphasise what they do like about ""Das Leben der Anderen"" so I would like to write down what disappointed me. The soundtrack music was much too strong for my personal taste. This is the problem with most Hollywood films or films in Hollywood style: There is so much music in the foreground that it leaves no places for your own thoughts, ideas, impressions and feelings. Sometimes the music *dictates* what the viewer is supposed to feel and how he should react. To explain my problem I always give the example that in some scenes the viewer is simply forced to grab the next handkerchief. Most people might enjoy that, but I do like to *choose* how I feel when watching a scene. I want to be able to concentrate on how the actors deliver the scene, how it is put in pictures and everything else the is to notice beside that overwhelming music. Maybe you get an idea what I try to say.I do not want to be mean but I have to say... to the end of the film I had the impression I was watching a kind of ""Schindler's List"" about the DDR. (I won't explain that to Spielberg fans!!!)Still I do believe it is a start. I hope there are more films about that topic to follow!"
pedrodebiasi,"Dec 22, 2007",7/10,"It is overrated because critics talked about a poignant masterpiece, and it ended up being just a well-done yet trivial political drama. When it gets to the Academy, I have quite a lot to talk about. In this highly personal review, I have to discuss the Oscar thoroughly, since ""The Lives of Others"" won the 2007 award for Best Foreign Language Film, in a monstrously unfair prize. Have I seen all the other contenders? No, but I've seen one, that being ""Pan's Labyrinth"", and the quality of it is so superior to this overrated German production that the latter should't have even been nominated beside the former.Don't get me wrong. This is not a bad movie. On the other side, all the buzz around it (the Academy Award, high scores at the IMDb site, superlative reviews) made me expect a flawless work of art, while this is just a good political drama. There are many average things in ""The Lives of Others"", enough to make it pretty much like a trivial movie. The screenplay has plenty of redundancies (the fingerprint, some over-explicative lines, the excessive ending), sign of a cowardice that aims for giving lazy audiences a circular, closed plot. Many explanations are passable, and most of them weaken the narrative, which could allow mystery and admittedly unanswered questions.Another problem is the lack of rhythm of director Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck. The first hour is incredibly slow, focusing only in the spied couple, and, all of a sudden, things start to happen every minute, to maintain the grasp that wasn't achieved in the previous moments. Many of the plot twists are, as already cited, unnecessary, and some are pretty formulaic. For an example, the discovery of a character that knows about the wiretaps, and the encounter, where a plan unravels, is derivative from countless movies. Another case is that of Wiesler's trajectory: far from his unexplained fascination on Dreyman and Sieland, the big issue about his character is the ending. That kind of redemption is derivative as well, a huge copy of Hollywood's formula (here goes a hint for why the Academy gave the prize to the film)  and the last scene is so artificial that it almost ruins everything that was constructed until there.While formulaic, trivial and occasionally exaggerated, the screenplay has its assets. Other characters, especially Sieland and Dreyman, have much better conclusions (and the latter's one is the best turning point of the movie, and a strong moment). On the other side, the distinct issue that Georg discovers, because of his friend's death, is not an easy choice to facilitate his decision to publish a critical article. Some dialogs are brilliant, like Wiesler's second interrogatory, which makes an elegant connection with previous lines and delivers tension and even frustration. More tense moments are unevenly scattered throughout the projection, but work wonders, thanks to Donnersmack's good direction, whose highlight is the deft use of the sound: the score is not only distinct, but well-placed. Silences are blended with noisy moments or clean dialogs, and the cork scene is the most relevant one: it marks the time when Wiesler has heard too much.Wiesler hears all that he needs for his job, but it ends up being too much for his convictions. Something in him tells that the Stasi is wrong, and that Dreyman mustn't be stopped. Some part of him wants to save the couple from the closing menace, and the viewers are not given a straight reason. The best aspect of the screenplay is the unexplained motive, portraying, maybe, Wiesler's own doubt as to what makes him be so fond of those people. Mühe plays this role wonderfully, portraying the spy as a cold man at first (cold but not dead, since he is shown with a prostitute), without many emotions to show. Later, on the other side, his lack of expressions is used to hide feelings. Paradoxically, doubt and confusion are present in his blank face, as if he doesn't dare to feel anything before knowing what it is (the last scene, as bad as it is, confirms that), and that results in beautiful, long takes of his null expression.Stealing the show every time, Ulrich is the very best cast member, but the others do not disappoint. Koch portrays Dreyman as a great defender of the party in the beginning, but his intellectual mind manages to find, in a strong sentiment of loss, the wit and courage to criticize the system he used to defend, and, ultimately, leaves the doubt: was he just faking his support to Communism, or did he truly believe at its leaders at first? Actually, this asset is more of the screenplay than of the actor, whose work is adequate, never outstanding. In Sieland's role, Gedeck has some beautiful moments, as a woman whose loyalty is always tested, and whose choices are not always altruistic. Her ambiguity appears as strong as Dreyman's, and relates to his in an elegant way. Two other important characters, Paul (Hans-Uwe Bauer) and Albert (Volkmar Kleinert), have small roles (too small, let's say), but amuse because of the first's subtle irreverence and for the second's subtle melancholy.Had the screenplay tried to avoid stupid clichés, easy resolutions and over-explanation, this would have been a true comment-inducer. As it is, occasional assets cannot hide all the triviality that reigns over in the film. ""The Lives of Others"", curiously, was awarded for following some strict Hollywood rules, and not for being a respectfully distinct foreign film. It is just a good political drama, with some comment on the German History and decent character development. The Oscar shows again how intolerant it is, awarding a good movie while a truly masterpiece like ""Pan's Labyrinth"" is put aside because of its daring format. The Academy proves that it doesn't praise originality, nor even quality, but adequacy to its prehistorical single-mindedness."
THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Feb 10, 2020",10/10,"A masterstroke for truth! the little man versus the all powerful machine and though he very nearly loses everything in his fight against evil ,he triumphs and retains his soul.

drake-stanton,"Apr 15, 2010",7/10,"This film is unquestionably well put together. It has all the elements in place, a good story, good actors, good directory of photography, good set design and good music. So how is it that this film is 'overrated'. Simply because it receives overly gracious marks being that it is a foreign language film. This film is quite comprable to ""good luck, good night"" or other past regime type thrillers. For it to be considered #55 on the IMDb list is too high in my mind. Is it one of the best 200 films of all time, perhaps, I would be forced to say yes, like most people because you just can't think of a better German movie, Run Lola Run was an fantastic and fun film but this is truly a piece of stern and forthright filmaking. If I have to rate the film it is a 7 of 10, losing points for it's somewhat lackluster pace and also for it's lack of humor and exciting events until the finale sequence, I hate to say a film is lacking anything because a story is a story and what it has in it, it has in it, but this film wouldn't have suffered from an exciting or pointed moment of tension if the middle of the film. I believe #55 is a little too high for this film to sit but it was overall a very solid film. (note these comments come after seeing the film 4 times)"
toqtaqiya2,"Nov 13, 2012",9/10,"West German director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck crafted an engaging drama in The Lives Of Others, his first feature film. At the center of this film is the impressive performance by Ulrich Muhe as Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler, an officer of the Stasi. Wiesler is an efficient and loyal employee who goes through changes he didn't expect. After listening in on Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck) and Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), two fine artists whose lifestyle is different from his he begins to doubt his work. In addition to the excellent performances from the cast and Donnersmarck's effective direction the film is aided by Hagen Bogdanski's expert cinematography. Some reviewers stressed the feeling of paranoia in The Lives Of Others but my opinion is that instead the film amplifies the relationships that all people have every day. By picking these characters Donnersmarck stresses humanity. This approach leads to a satisfying emotional ending. While The Lives Of Others is a very good piece of filmmaking it's certainly not a history lesson. The German Democratic Republic was perhaps the state with the most surveillance in the Eastern Bloc but even there there were only a few Wieslers and personal or even erotic motifs played a somewhat subordinate role in the musty atmosphere of East German socialism. The film is not an accurate presentation of life in the Eastern Bloc, and it was intentionally made to look gray. Another factor is the film's Best Picture win at the 2006 Academy Awards, which by the way is a tentacle of American propaganda. The film that should have won was Pan's Labyrinth, but instead The Lives Of Others was picked for ideological reasons. Despite these obvious flaws and problems The Lives Of Others is still one of the best German films of recent years, and internationally it grossed an impressive $77 million."
bobbobwhite,"Mar 12, 2007",9/10,"Even though The Departed may be judged by most to be more powerful and shocking, this film shocks but it also saddens, and then encourages the heart in a unique way that senses-bludgeoning films like The Departed cannot...in the inexorable and certain life-draining way that only stories detailing the harsh realities of a life without hope can do, and then which show a complete about face and tell the resulting story of total transformation and its effects on the same people. Always difficult to do, but was done with brilliance in this film.Most of this film was about people's unhappy lives without hope under Socialism, but then come the transformations, individual and national, that change everything. This film develops the story of dreary but threatening communist ""hope oppression"" better than any I can remember since the '50's film, ""1984"". Without hope to encourage us, what else is there to the real value of life?The very soulful and talented Urich Muhe(his features hint of Kevin Spacey) plays the role of a hardened national police captain who is the central screw on which the story turns, a totally committed socialist party cop who undergoes a complete, but not overtly joyful, change of heart that works to alter forever the fortunes of the story's foil, a writer/playwright of increasingly ""questionable"" political views who, as a result, becomes a central target of the Stasi, the national security police that was shown to be ubiquitous and all-powerful, and every bit as formidable and scary as the outrageously inhuman ""Big Brother"" that terrified citizens in ""1984"".Early on, Muhe played the police captain as a Jack Webb/Joe Friday-type cop.....humorless, cold, stiff and ruthlessly committed to doing the best but also the meanest job he could do in a mean business to root out any and all political dissenters. Muhe's role interpretation in his gradual but complete transformation to the other side personally and politically was nothing less than acting brilliance, and probably the best acting of the year in any film. Don't miss it, as you will be missing rare acting greatness if you do, and at least the equal to the brilliance of Massimo Triosi in Il Postino.Also, along with the greatest movie-ending lines in history, the very last line in this film summed up everything that happened before in the best and fewest words possible, and it will surely move you greatly, not only from immense sadness and pity for what happened to the disgraced former cop but also from great hope and gratitude for the people in this world who finally see the true light as did Muhe's transformed police captain, and then put it to work bettering the world even though the personal cost may be great. An heroic act of course, but even more, one worthy of emulation by all of us.""The Lives of Others"" was so emotionally powerful throughout but nearly overwhelming at the end, as it showed so well one of the greatest life-lessons that can be learned by anyone, and one never to be forgotten....some of your good deeds will be rewarded in some way.(added 1/23/08: one of the best movies and lead role acting in decades. Urich Muhe died recently, and what a tragic loss of talent and person. His death makes me also sadly grieve the similar fates of the magnificent Massimo Triosi of Il Postino, and the creative genius Adrienne Shelley of Waitress....both also died much too young right after their highly acclaimed triumphs in those films.)"
yris2002,"Dec 5, 2009",9/10,"It is the second time I have seen this movie. When I first saw it I remember feeling upset by the idea that just a little more than 20 years ago, in the heart of a civilized and enlightened Europe, there dominated such cultural repression and such terroristic means of questioning. Not that history of the former DDR was unknown to me, but probably because undeveloped at school, or probably because a little disregarded also by cinematography, it was rather upsetting. On a second watching, having assimilated the strong impact of the first one, I could better analyze the quality of the movie from a cinematographic point of view, and really appreciate it. It has a solid structure which makes every shot perfectly match with the whole, and contributes to an overall clear, lucid and perfectly built drama. The story proceeds with a quick pace, each scene is the preparation for the next one, everything is under control and follows a well marked and gripping path. The cast is simply outstanding: the actress playing Christa Maria is truly convincing in showing her deep inner laceration between her love for the stage and her love for Georg, the handsome and attractive dramatist, who knows where the right side lies, but finds it hard to assert it explicitly. But who leaves the most emotionally powerful mark is Ulrich Muhe interpreting Wiesler: he stirs thought and emotion, he is so dramatically contained, as his character requires, but, in a single hint at a smile (whe he reads Brecht's poems), conveys such a desperate yearning for true life, I think an Oscar deserving interpretation. In the end, a movie I would absolutely advise: it is intelligently thought-provoking, intellectually honest, and solidly built: a high-level piece of cinema. Really worth seeing."
Philby-3,"Mar 31, 2007",9/10,"It has been suggested that the story of Hauptmann Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe), a senior, dedicated and zealous Stasi East German (DDR) secret police officer who starts to empathise with the subjects of his investigation is rather improbable, but to me it rings true emotionally.His subjects are Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), a playwright currently in party favour, and his actress lover Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck). Sooner or later, an inhabitant of the chill world of secret policing with no private life to speak of sent to investigate ""artists"" is going to feel the warmth and charm of the milieu he is spying on, especially where, as here, he soon realises that his superiors' motives for the investigation are corrupt.Apologists for the Stasi (and given it employed 100,000 and had at least 200,000 informers these are numerous) say the DDR was a system that ran according to laws which were designed to protect society, but as is inevitable in totalitarian regimes the laws were perverted by those in charge to serve their own ends. Thus loathsome culture minister Hempf wants to get something on Dreyman so he can have the lovely Christa Maria all to himself, and Wiesler's slimy boss Grubitz is only too happy to oblige.Wiesler's conversion from dedicated servant of the regime to furtive dissident is an amazing process to watch, and Ulrich Muhe, who happens to be an ""ossi"" (former DDR resident), makes it very plausible. Despite tragedy, the movie has a surprisingly upbeat ending. The complacent Hempf believes people don't change but this does not mean they are entirely predictable.We see a fair amount of the Stasi at work. The rank and file are not portrayed as monsters, or automatons, just ordinary workers prepared to crack jokes about their masters at work. Most of what they do is minor harassment directed towards encouraging conformity. It is not hard to break the rules in a society where you need permission to subscribe to a foreign newspaper. It is an interesting irony that one of the catalysts of Wiesler's silent rebellion is the work of Bertold Brecht, at one time an enthusiastic supporter of the DDR.Whatever you think of its politics, this is a very fine film, with not a single one of its 137 minutes wasted. It is certainly an antidote to the ""ossie"" nostalgia said to possess some residents of the former DDR and wonderfully satirised in ""Good-Bye Lenin"". But it also asks all of us how would we behave in similar circumstances. If it might be to your individual advantage (and to the disadvantage of your enemy) would you do it? The Stasi had even otherwise loving couples informing on each other. We can only hope that, despite our own overzealous secret policemen who are doing their best to undermine our civil liberties in the name of anti-terrorism, we never get to such depths in this country. I do hope Phil Ruddock (our Attorney-General) gets to see this movie."
nikanavi,"Dec 7, 2024",10/10,"The film delves into the depths of human nature, portraying a story of choice, self-sacrifice, and courage against the backdrop of a ruthless party system and total control. It's a tale of a man who, defying all odds, becomes a protector and guardian, risking his life for a stranger. A man who manages to transcend his own essence and make a choice that was not only forbidden to him but had never even formed in his consciousness.This remarkable film evokes complex and contradictory feelings. For much of its runtime, you feel as if you're in constant tension, afraid to ""say or think something unnecessary."" You catch fleeting glimpses of the emotions gradually emerging in the characters: Wiesler-quietly undergoing a profound transformation, and Gerd-with his subtle tragedy that touches the very soul. It's hard not to think that even machines are capable of feeling.Ulrich Mühe masterfully embodied the character of Gerd, portraying his precision, loyalty to the party, and his slowly awakening humanity. His gaze alone is a phenomenon. Many actors rely on facial expressions to convey emotion, but Ulrich needed only his piercing blue eyes to say it all.Sebastian Koch, in the role of Georg Dreyman, captivates with his sincerity and depth. Every emotion-joy, pain, shock, despair-is vividly expressed in each frame, making his character truly alive. A brilliant performance! Martina Gedeck, who played Christa, may not fit the mold of a classic beauty, but her character combines fatal allure, tender vulnerability, and inner conflict. She portrays her role so naturally that it's impossible to look away.The impeccable direction, editing, and a powerful musical score create incredible tension and keep the audience emotionally engaged throughout the film. One unforgettable scene is when Dreyman learns of Jerska's death and sits down at the piano to play his music. These moments are profoundly moving.The numerous awards, nominations, glowing reviews from critics, audience recognition, and impressive box office success speak for themselves. This is a living, soul-stirring film that is worth seeing. And perhaps revisiting multiple times-because every viewing brings new emotions and leaves a poignant feeling that culminates in the finale, where the film ultimately seizes your heart."
gavin6942,"Nov 20, 2014",7/10,"In 1984 East Berlin, an agent of the secret police (Ulrich Mühe), conducting surveillance on a writer (Sebastian Koch) and his lover (Martina Gedeck), finds himself becoming increasingly absorbed by their lives.Apparently, this was one of the first post-Berlin Wall films to be a drama rather than a comedy (such as Wolfgang Becker's ""Good Bye, Lenin!""). Certainly the best, if not the first. Today it is somewhat hard to imagine that not long ago Germany was split, with two sides spying on each other, when they were really one people under two governments.Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, describing it as ""a powerful but quiet film, constructed of hidden thoughts and secret desires."" Very esoteric, Roger. There is certainly much more going on than is openly expressed in the film."
clever_sherry,"Jun 17, 2022",10/10,"Such a great movie, deserves to be remembered by the movie history. I found myself with tears on my face when the movie ends, so touching and heartbreaking. Maybe one day I'll watch it with my child, grandchild."
toreadore-1,"Oct 20, 2006",7/10,"To be taken back to the brown and greyish days of the German Democrat Republic is a fascinating trip, which I enjoyed in the same kind of voyeuristic way as how I imagine Stasi agents followed the lives of the citizens of the Workers State. After watching Das Leben des Anderen, I didn't just feel I had seen a movie about 1980's East Germans, I felt I was a 1980's East German, my blue Peugeout was a lightbrown Wartburg, my lovely wife was an undercover agent. In other words, the movie caught me with its accurate realism.My few objections go on the ending, and how I feel the director doesn't have much faith in the historical insight of his audience. Not a few times we had to be reminded that Glasnost and die Wände was on its way, so I guess not even Paris Hilton would miss the point. The film was already on the wrong side of two hours, so a couple of the final scenes could easily have been cut out and a little more could have been up the viewer. I have felt this lack of subtility in other German movies and I think it's a shame.Those are just minor flaws though and it's by far one of the best movies I've seen this year."
Rubicx,"Jul 7, 2008",4/10,"Why and how did this film win the Oscar for best foreign language film 2006???? Clearly ""Pan's Labrynth"" should have won. I was eager to see ""The Live of Others"" after it had won the Oscar, and now that I have seen it my my question is why did it win? Politics? The Lola prize? Preferences for German films? Color theory? Actor preferences? Discovery Channel fans? This film had a major inauthentic hole. It is completely PRETENTIOUS to believe that a police investigator changed his attitude towards his work and towards his victims because of his exposure to art, specifically to his exposure to music from Beethoven. Was this a comedy? This film had almost everything else going for it, but the premise was so bogus that it made the rest of the film unforgivable. The acting was good. The scenery gray and tyrannical. The reality of East Berlin was authentic, but once again the premise was NOT authentic. No one, no one changes because they heard a score from Beethoven and or saw a play. They may be affected by that for a little while, but they go back to being themselves thereafter, especially a cold-blooded, career-oriented police investigator from the Stasi. Maybe if he had taken piano lessons for five years he would had changed and had seen his humanity, and the humanity of others, but not because he heard his victims playing a piano piece. BS!!! Rescind the Oscar and give it to Pan's Labrynth !"
MaCVaLLeY,"Dec 17, 2018",9/10,"Every seconds passes makes you feel time goes smoothly, you're slowly entangled to the story until you heart feel the melody, and you will not want the movie to end nor the melody to depart, you just want more because it feel so damn true, this must have happened before, it surely did and that how it feels like, the lead character every inch of his face makes thousand of emotions and his eyes, focus on his eyes and how they capture your soul, splendid acting and very poetic movie, respect to the director, i loved your movie."
truemythmedia,"Jun 28, 2019",10/10,"I remember when the NSA/ Edward Snowden scandal broke there were a few differing opinions on the topic; either you were outraged (though not entirely surprised) that the government had been keeping tabs on you (as I was), or, you shrugged it off as if it was no big deal. ""I've got nothing to hide,"" was one of the most common things I heard stated. ""If the government wants to spy on me they'll probably be pretty bored."" To me, that kind of nonchalance about this very serious issue is just as terrifying as finding out that the government is spying on us.Sure, you might not have anything to hide now, but what happens when suddenly your friendly neighbor, whom occasionally talked brashly about the government, just disappears and no one goes looking for him? What happens when your wife or daughter starts getting approached by public officials and blackmailed for sex? What happens when innocent protesters end up detained in windowless prison cells for months? These are not situations I've made up to scare you; these are things that have happened and will happen again. If we don't keep those in power in check, it will happen in our own country.To the people that approach the idea of surveillance states with lackadaisical ambivalence, I think they need to see movies like ""The Lives of Others"" or ""4 Months, 3 Weeks, and 2 Days""; they need to read books like 1984 and Fahrenheit 451. This issue is not one we should approach with a shrug; it's an issue we need to fight, tooth and nail, with every scrap of energy we can muster.Anyways, that is why I personally love this movie and think it's a masterpiece (my second viewing has cemented its place in my top 100 films of all time), but from a cinematic standpoint, this movie is absolutely incredible as well.

Generalle_della_Rovere,"Nov 14, 2011",8/10,"Quite possibly the best film released in the 2000s, Von Donnersmark masterpiece regarding the influence and the attraction of an individual towards another's creates an image which was very well interpreted to the masterclass cinematography and musical accompaniment of Hagen Bogdanski and Stéphane Moucha, respectively. Set in the fascist era of Germany, Das Leben Der Anderen depicts a surveyor's (Wieser) interaction with a seemingly loyal writer (Dreyman) through suspicions from the Minister. The wonderful acting from the leads namely: Ulrich Muhe and Sebastian Koch along with the supporting cast delivers this rather inspiring film contrary to the the film's opening environment. This is my first time seeing the film and though it is already 4 years since it was released, it still as fresh and original as any film released recently."
CinemaClown,"Aug 9, 2015",N/A,"Winner of Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film, The Lives of Others has a very serene ambiance when compared to other entries in the spy genre which are usually filled with chases, action or violence for this German drama tries to paint an authentic portrait of life in East Germany and is a silent observation of human nature.Set in 1980s East Germany, the story of The Lives of Others (also known as Das Leben der Anderen) focuses on the monitoring of East Berlin by agents of the Stasi; the secret police, and concerns an agent who's tasked to conduct a surveillance on a writer & his lover, but over the course of his duty ends up becoming too infatuated with their lives.Written & directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, The Lives of Others is crafted in an incredibly calm n composed manner, and presents the filmmaker in firm grip of the story he attempts to bring to life on the film canvas, which sounds even more astonishing when noted that it is his directional debut. And the proper execution of other aspects only work out in its favour.Set pieces & locations do evoke an authentic-looking atmosphere of East Germany. The camera-work is carefully employed as the movements are static for the most part, use of lighting & colour tones is skilfully done, and the drama is captured in fine detail. Editing unfolds its 137 minutes of runtime at a very relaxed pace, and the performances by its entire cast is simply outstanding.On an overall scale, The Lives of Others is an engaging drama that manages to create & sustain its tension amazingly well, gets better as the plot progresses, and concludes its tale in a very satisfying manner. The script is definitely its biggest strength and rest of the stuff is wonderfully handled too but its glacial pace & quietness did bother me at times. Not as rewarding as I expected it to be but definitely a work of pristine quality that deserves a broader audience."
pawebster,"Mar 28, 2006",7/10,"Since about 2004, Germany has been producing some interesting films looking at and reworking its history (Sophie Scholl, The Downfall, Napola). This is one of the first 'serious' films to go into the dark aspects of the old East Germany. It's all about the Stasi (secret police) undermining and ruining people's lives, in this case the lives of prominent writers and actors. In the process -- and this is one of the unbelievable parts with no known historical precedent, as far as I'm aware -- the main surveillance person (Ulrich Mühe) warms somewhat to his victims and sees the emptiness of his own life.Unfortunately, the film muddies the waters by making sex a major motive. This is unnecessary, irrelevant and also without much historical foundation.It is very well acted by all concerned and successfully conjures up the required atmosphere.It is one of those very 'small', low-budget German films (like Sophie Scholl) that in Britain would be a TV film and would never make it into a cinema. Presumably for financial and prestige reasons, films like this are shown on general release in cinemas in Germany.In fact, it does not require a cinema at all, since there is nothing that calls for a big screen. My tip would be to wait for it to come out on DVD."

poisonborz,"Jan 31, 2007",7/10,"Firstly, as I see, most of the good things are already written down in other comments, so I guess I'm the one who pulls this down a bit. Yes, now, just after seeing this, I guess it's a bit over-hyped. But that's a good thing.Please note that I live in Hungary (you know, highest suicide rates... even after 20 years, we still are in the top 10) so I've seen a lot of films dealing with agents, stasi, both dramas, comedies, or comedic dramas. Because of this, maybe I've seen this film a bit differently.For an average movie-goer, where Lives of Others mostly fails is the original, film-like dramatic storytelling. Most of the plot twists can be guessed. Supporting characters, and even some not-so-supporting, are one-dimensional. Dreyman remains totally uninteresting. But surprisingly, in this movie, this is the part, that is the less important one.Lives of Others is probably the one, and icon-like movie every post-communist country should make, not for the global market, but for themselves. Dealing, and accepting the past, that the dictatorial system wasn't built up of some leaders, not even party members, but thousands of people, is a trauma, that we couldn't accept until now. Where Lives of Others truly shines, is the completeness of the story. Revealing all the sides, all the emotions, figures and personalities around an institution like the STASI, and this is the point. Not the actual story.I'm glad that it had an impact like this in the USA - as anyone can read from comments, most of the Americans taught that a communist nation was an absurd, funny, sometimes hard, but overall likable system. I truly hope this movie will shed some light on something else.Please give a minute thinking of the fact, that in these countries lived millions of Dreymans."
rorybiggadike,"Mar 11, 2010",2/10,"I watched this movie only by chance after first reading many eulogies it received among reviewers. As the theme developed and I began to enjoy the immediacy of the plot I slowly realized this wasn't quite the sensitive searching look back upon a failed social experiment I'd been led to believe. As you would expect modern performers are convincing actors - I think the sharpness and no frills approach of modern TV drama has over the years lifted the profession anyway. Can anyone imagine how long an temperamental Joan Crawford type of artist would last in today's climate! The plot whilst rather transparent was adequate. As it developed and later seemed to hinge upon the DDR suicide issue I could see the female lead was probably doomed - but then I remembered another real life suicide 'urban myth' from my younger days. In those days Sweden was (somewhat irritating for certain quarters) successful in its social policies. Its 'progressive' politicians with their caring 'populist' internal behavior and humane foreign approach won a great deal of admiration - after a while assertions started circulating in the media. ""Ah yes but""...suddenly it seemed they had the highest suicide ratings in the world - seemingly there was insufficient excitement in Swedish lives. Boredom caused them to dive under buses, jump into rivers and hang themselves under bridges. Hmmm! I expected an intelligent and genuine examination of a top/down flawed new approach to Societies problems - a filmed reversal of the many failed attempts over thousands of years to overthrow the stifling elites by revolt from below. I'm afraid this movie is being hailed by the same people who convinced me that Obama saw things in a different light....his was a new approach....the tone is certainly different but nothing has altered. 'The lives of others' is yet another example - you've seen it before, nothing is changed it is just another predictably praised - I noticed for instance Wm Buckley and one of the Podhoritz clan - two of the foundling godfathers of the NeoCon mafia lauding it as 'The greatest movie I've ever seen' in one case and 'One of the greatest movies ever made in the other'. We've been conned again I'm sorry to say it's just another 'Commie Bashing' production. The movie was seen eventually on a business trip with a well known Airline - I am flying again a few weeks time and am look forward to a viewing of Michael Moores latest item 'Capitalism - a love story'. Ahem....I'm sure it will be freely available."
R_Alex_Jenkins,"Dec 22, 2013",8/10,"About half-an-hour into the movie I thought I was in for a bit of a rough ride, you know... that force-yourself-to-the-end type of film. Fortunately, the movie got better and more intriguing as it progressed, turning out to be a very rewarding piece of entertainment.Luckily, I managed to bypass my initial negative preconceptions, such as the German language, having subtitles and no recognisable actors, deciding to give the film a go based on my very positive experiences of foreign language films this year, in the place of the usual insult to your intelligence, spoon-fed Hollywood fodder.It's a rewarding film that requires a certain amount of perseverance at the start. It's educational, thought provoking, visually intriguing but not beautiful, almost beleaguering your senses with the grimy weather, the drab clothes worn by practically all, the use of greys and browns for furnishings, the austere colour palette, the depressing standard of the cars and vans, and virtually nothing joyous or warm to look at. We're instead reliant on our involvement with the characters and their insights and motives for doing what they do.A film that seems to adapt and improvise as it goes along, the characters feeling their way through events as well, entering uncharted waters and discovering the need to swim. Yet again, film that establishes the value of historical diversity that Germany has to offer from the 20th century. Only, the language/subtitle thing may put a few people off from the start, which is a shame if you're young and looking for action-satisfaction."
kaaffilm,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"""The Lives of Others"" is a gripping and haunting portrayal of life in East Germany under the watchful eye of the Stasi secret police. Directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, this film tells the story of a Stasi agent who becomes increasingly drawn into the lives of those he is spying on. The performances are outstanding, particularly that of Ulrich Mühe as the conflicted Stasi officer. The film is beautifully shot and the pacing is masterful, building tension and suspense throughout. The themes of surveillance, privacy, and the abuse of power are as relevant today as they were in 1984. ""The Lives of Others"" is a thought-provoking and powerful film that will stay with you long after the credits roll."
Westeire,"Jan 31, 2014",10/10,"This is a very intense German triller. Exceptionally well made, not what I expected and as the movie progressed you fine yourself re-evaluating the characters.. Nothing negative to write about this movie, a simply script well acted. I only wish more movies were made like this, for 2 million dollars they made a masterpiece of cinema. Watch it. Florian Henckel-Donnersmarck's direction with its twists and turns kept the audience glued to the screen. Because of the film's popularity,And even though the movie has very tough moments it is all so well done and presented with such a good taste that in the end you feel some sort of relieved."
howardvause,"Jul 30, 2008",10/10,"A true gem of a movie; watch it and I guarantee the subtitles will melt away within the first fifteen minutes! ""Das Leben der Anderen"" is currently being remade as ""The Lives of Others"". Could be good; an English language version would open up this poetic and universal human story to an even wider audience. But what if the re-makers forget to remove their Made-in-Hollywood hobnail boots before stomping all over it? You see, the great thing about this movie is its authenticity and understatement. It explores its themes (political power, personal evolution, the nature of hope, compassion, integrity, loyalty...) with enormous power but also with an audience-respecting feather-light touch.For all its subtlety, its muted palette and moderate pacing, this is a gripping and rattlingly well-told tale which unfolds with twists and turns towards a satisfying, intelligent conclusion. And, as is so often the case with a directorial debut, this film is bursting with fresh ideas and a real creative passion. Oh, and it's also very well cast with excellent performances.Perhaps not exactly a barrel of laughs, but by the end of the film you may find your faith in humanity is repaired and your spirits lifted. Please pass the Kleenex."
netrom2301,"Aug 24, 2015",10/10,"If you're going to see one foreign-languaged movie this year, make it this one. Better yet, if you're going to see one movie this year, make it this one. Every aspect of this movie is just outstanding. The music is hauntingly beautiful, the cinematography is excellent, and even though I don't understand much German, the writing seemed excellent as well. It's all crafted together to a level of perfection that you rarely see. You really feel like you are in East Berlin as you watch this one.What makes this movie unique is that you don't just get a truly great story. You also get great insight to the DDR. You get to see many different sides of the republic, witnessing many different fates.PS: I don't really know why I gave this movie a 9 instead of a 10. You know what, consider my rating a 10."
bob the moo,"Mar 17, 2008",N/A,"In 1984 East Germany is ruled by the Stasi, the secret police whose goal is to know everything and root out any signs of disloyalty to the ruling party. Whenever writer Georg Dreyman and his actress girlfriend Christa-Maria are placed under suspicion the Stasi are put on surveillance duty over his whole life, the task being given to one of their most trusted and experienced men, Captain Gerd Wiesler. Wiesler learns of the true motivations behind the surveillance and at the same time finds himself more and more drawn into the lives of Sieland and Dreyman from his unseen vantage point.The few critical remarks on this page have mainly focused on one aspect of the film  its pace. I will concede that the film moves quite slowly and that those looking for ""Enemy of the State"" type thrills will be disappointed. However this is more to do with them as viewers rather than the film because for the majority of us the ""slowness"" will be patience and the lack of action set pieces just leaves more room for character and plot development. What it then manages to do is all the more surprising for being the directorial debut of writer/director von Donnersmarck, the outcome is a solid and satisfying story that may not make everything clear as day but in not doing this it actually respects the viewer rather than disappointing them.At essence the story starts about the surveillance mission but, much in the same way as Wiesler is drawn in, the viewer find the attention then split between the characters, all of them on quite an equal footing. The themes of power and ""good"" are explored within the characters in ways that I found to be interesting, challenging and very well done. It is usually a mark of a good film that one is still thinking about it a few days later (well, apart from some films that are so bad I'm still thinking murderous thoughts about them days later!). Donnersmarck has done very well as writer to build the themes into the nature of the characters and their stories so that repeat viewings or reflections on the film provide more of interest. His direction is strong as well, producing strong shots that stick in the memory and also make good use of the sets.The cast are roundly good. Mühe is the main one that people draw attention to and rightly so as his grey little man manages to fascinate with few words or direct actions. Gedeck is good but in a different way as her character carries much more of the weight in regards the pressure of the Stasi and also the thoughts over the morality of her character  she brings these out well. Koch is not quite the presence I had wanted as I found him a bit bland but yet still serviceable in the character. Support is suitably menacing from Tukur and Thieme and the cast doesn't really have a weak link in it.Overall then an excellent and mature film that deserves the praise and the awards it has garnered. Those complaining that it is ""slow"" are correct in their statement but I do not agree with it as a criticism  just an observation of the pace. Instead the steady delivery allows for the gradual development of characters, story and themes that are surprisingly rich, engaging and ultimately satisfying. One of those films that provides food for thought for some time after viewing."
paterfam001,"Mar 13, 2007",7/10,"I was disappointed on seeing this film, and surprised that it won the foreign-language best-film Oscar in competition with 'Pan's Labyrinth', since PL is a far better film, with imaginative depth and visceral feeling quite lacking in the worthy German semi-documentary.The odd thing is that the two have a similar theme, resistance to totalitarian rule -- and both after the fact, since both the East German Communists and Franco's Falange have passed into history. The difference between them is the difference between fact and myth. Fact can be compelling, but surely not so much so, after the fact; myth is always compelling, before the fact or after, and 'Pan's Labyrinth' is myth, folk-tale, Marchen, full of motherhood, blood and mandrake root, grim and beautiful by turns."
manuel-pestalozzi,"Dec 8, 2008",5/10,"What I like about this movie are the sets, the locations and the editing. As a viewer I could really believe that I am looking into Eastern Germany in the 1980s. The wiring and the ensuing connection between the artist's flat and the cold, drafty attic with the listening post perfectly showed the perverseness and the absurdity of that particular totalitarian system. The highlight for me was, when a guest in the apartment, an enthusiastic journalist from the West, pops the cork of a bottle of champagne. The cork hits a light switch in which a hearing device is hidden, a very quick and short cut to the attic shows how the guy with the headphones winces in silent pain. The movie also makes it very clear that the Socialist systems outmaneuvered themselves with their paranoia  what remains of them are vestiges of Russian style secret service systems (but that is older then Socialism and probably has little to do with it).What I dislike about this movie is primarily that it is designed as a melodrama. The story is by nature an obscure one. The actions are stealthy ones, almost all that happens happens in the dark. This is transformed into long epic scenes which might attract a mass audience but do not fit the subject matter. I found the overbearing (and often praised) musical score hard to stand. In order to appreciate a melodrama you have to identify with the characters. And this I could not do. It must be said that the people who in this movie were the victims were also people of that totalitarian system. They were successful artists who made a career. They knew amply well how to play"" that system and basically supported it. I am sure it was a great privilege to live in a spacious flat in the center of Eastern Berlin. The victims are not half starved idealistic artists who would die for an ideal, they are rather  let's face it  fat cats with a healthy sense for survival. I found their intellectual whining rather sickening. One has to assume that with such a privileged lifestyle it was easy to generate jealousy in members of the surveillance squads (and I am certain this was systematically, tactically done). Therefore it is difficult to believe in the development of goodness"" in the main character. The movie intimates that it is triggered by music the listener hears in the apartment. I did not find that very convincing."
Milo_Milosovic,"Apr 8, 2014",9/10,"Is it possible for a man to be good if he's part of a bad system? This is just one of the many questions raised by the 2006 Oscar Winner for best foreign language film. Set In 1984 East Berlin, Gerd Wiesler is an agent of the Stasi. A good one. So good he conducts lectures on interrogation techniques of enemies of the state. He's tasked with an assignment to monitor Georg Dreyman, an influential playwright with on the surface seems a poster-child of the GDR.What unfolds is a thoughtful and thought-provoking drama. Wiesler observes not only his target but the nature of the system he works for. His observation, near silent most of the time, reveals not only the complexities of Dreyman's personal life and political beliefs but also the corruption of a system he holds steadfastly to be perfect. It's a beautifully profound human drama that asks suitably profound questions. Can bad acts be legitimised if the perpetrator believes them to be inherently good? Can art be true without the freedom of expression? What are the limits of loyalty? The performances are uniformly excellent. Ulrich Mühe shines as the torn Stasi officer. Playing him as a blank canvas reflecting the world around him yet wrestling with his own loneliness. While Martina Gedeck is excellent as the tragic and trapped actress whose relationship with Dreyman is stretched to breaking point.The film is subtle, observant and never feels the need to over-state it's key argument about the corruptive and corrosive effect of the Stasi on the GDR. Yet, the historical and political trappings are a framework to a touching human drama that works on almost all levels. Outstanding."
g-bodyl,"Sep 12, 2014",9/10,"The acclaimed German-speaking film, The Lives of Others is a well-written, addicting thriller that talks about a time in very modern history that not many movies have covered. This film covers Eastern Berlin in the 1980's, just before the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Unlike many thrillers, this film doesn't rely on drawn-out car chases or bloody gun battles, but more so on tense character development and I welt so moved by the film, I literally thought there would be members of the Stasi creeping up behind me while watching the film.Florian Donnersmark's film, which was awarded an Oscar for best foreign film, is about a member of the secret police named Captain Wiesler who listens into people he believes to be enemies. But when he is assigned to listen to the famous and beloved playwright, Georg Dreyman, his life is about to take on a big change.This film is great in part to the wonderful acting. The late Ulrich Muhe does a wonderful job as Captain Wiesler and all his scenes were just perfection. In fact, the final scene he is in should be enough to move you to tears. Sebastian Koch does a great job as Georg Dreyman, a playwright who is also bent on escaping over the Wall.Overall, The Lives of Others is a very well-made thriller that will teach you about the lifestyle of people back then and how the citizens had to live in fear. There are no car chases here, but there is an actual story that is worth checking out. These kind of slow-burners are the best thrillers of them all and this made for an engaging thriller. Despite being spoken in German, I think Americans should watch this film. I rate this film 9/10."
ongoam,"May 11, 2022",9/10,"This movie was one of my favorite thriller films of all time. This movie was set in the 80s in East Germany. This film was a realistic look at people in East Germany, how the Stasi worked, and many more."
jeepyjb,"May 26, 2011",8/10,"I grew up hearing about the horrors of living in an Eastern Block country. The blandness of life, the constant looking over one's shoulder. The Trabant! I was always fascinated by the irony that Soviet Russia reacted to the fall of the 3rd Reich with a socialist mask upon their fascist faces. This movie was a wonderfully intimate look at the grim reality of the Iron Curtain, and the humanity that simmered under the surface eventually leading to the wall collapse. Reagan didn't bring the wall down, the people did.... and Roger Waters. ha-ha This was a compelling movie. I can see why Depp and Jolie fell in love with the director. I can only hope his next film is better than The Tourist."
temporarybobi,"Apr 10, 2007",N/A,"It has been paid a lot of attention to the details in this film. This is the good part of the film.On the other hand, the plot and the choice for the actors Martina Gedeck, Sebastian Koch and Ulrich Tukur could have been better. Not that the actors don't perform well. On the contrary, but there are nuances missing. For example there is too much self-conscious coming over in their figures ... this is definitely not the aspect you would have met in GDR.The plot is O.K. We have to remember the dark sides of life in these states. Its also enough to remember about George Orwell.The film has a much greater ""educational"" value (""the good and the bad"") than an artistic one. It emphasizes too much the way the viewer should think about the situation once.Overall nice work for a debut movie."
woodvillelite-1,"Sep 16, 2006",9/10,I am not going to repeat what everyone else has already said as I agree with most of the comments. I have just seen it at the Toronto Film Festival and out of 24 movies I saw.... it far exceeded anything else I saw in the 9 days and can only say it was my #1 favourite. I feel fortunate that I live in such a multicultural city that we have this fantastic festival to see films such as this.I regret that I had to miss the Questions and Answers at the end of film as I had another film to get to. I would love to hear what was discussed if anyone else was there and would like to get back to me or post on board. PLEASE AND THANK YOU... sh
levhonsic,"Jul 28, 2019",5/10,"Well, I fell for the hype about this movie and finished it quite dissapointed. You get the impression that only politicians, spies and artists were living in DDR. If you know something about history of DDR, you'd knew that artists were highly respected and given relative artistic freedom as long as they didn't work against the system. The only brilliant thing about the movie are the actors."
BerlinGuy,"Aug 9, 2006",9/10,"so I finally got to see the film everyone has been talking about. I have also seen the talk show in which the director gets into an argument with East-German actor Henry Hübchen. I must admit the director comes across as arrogant bordering on annoying. He is obviously a wunderkind or something but he is actually such a smart-ass that I can't imagine a character less likable. Watching his discussion with Hübchen made me want to boycott the film (even though I adore the actors in it, Martina Gedeck and Ulrich Mühe)I am glad I didn't. It may not be historically accurate. I am from East Germany but I am too young to know. Yet, most people say the GDR as portrayed in the film was not the GDR of the 1980s but rather the (Stalinist) GDR of the 1950s. In the 1980s, most actors, singers, the famous people were able to extort the GDR government as they could just go west and embarrass the officials. If the writer/actress couple were really as famous as the film suggests, in 1984, the GDR officials would have given them anything they wanted. (the pivotal point was 1976 when dissident Wolf Biermann was denaturalized)In that respect, I understand Hübchen's criticism. He said he lived in the period and doesn't agree with the way it was portrayed. He fears that the will now stand testimony to the era and people may well think that this is the way it was. His grandson asked him why he didn't do anything about it, how he could live in a system like this etc. I suppose he is afraid Donnersmark steals his biography, in a way.However, it is still a work of fiction and people who watch a film should know. It is a good film, if overly dramatic, a little obvious, and Hollywood-IA. It has some great moments, actually. Mühe is fantastic as the man in grey.So, it's definitely worth checking out. I have a feeling it may get more appreciation abroad than in Germany. It was obviously produced with the foreign (esp American) audiences in mind. And I think it may translate pretty well into foreign territories as it gets enthusiastic notices from critics abroad.My favourite German film this year is still Sommer vorm Balkon, yet it appears foreigners don't get the subtle and sweet Berlin humour."
joeaneal,"Mar 24, 2007",10/10,"I was disappointed when Pan's Laybrinth didn't get the Academy Award for the best foreign film of 2006, but then I hadn't had a chance to see this movie. I'm an avid movie goer for the last 60 years and I have just about seen every worthwhile movie made. This movie is as good as any other movie I have seen if not better. It is by far the best movie made since the turn of the millennium if not for all time.If you are looking for a typical ""Hollywood"" formula movie then you had best not go to see this one. But, if you are looking for sublime movie making in every respect then this is the movie made for you. It doesn't matter if the movie is in German the subtitles are excellent and along with the acting and direction a perfect story is told.Support excellence in movie making by putting this movie on the top of your list to see this year."
georg-behrends,"Apr 3, 2006",10/10,"German movies usually have one of the following two problems: Either they mistake boredom for art or they mistake silliness for entertainment. Thus, the movies leaving this country usually bore the foreigners to death and/or try to be funny - but aren't.""Das Leben der Anderen"" is different. In my opinion it one of the very few German movies that meets the international standards in this area of entertainment: It tells a very intelligent and interesting story, keeps the audience entertained and excited from start to end and leaves the viewer affected and thrilled.I would not be surprised at all if this film became a great international success."
Eaglegrafix,"Dec 8, 2007",9/10,"This a movie that had to be made and must be seen by as many in the world as possible. If I were to comment much on the story, it would become overly political so I restrain. The movie is political but it says more about conflict of conscious and redemption than it does about political beliefs. A powerful story of tragedy and triumph, of greed and grace, of love and deception. It is a story about the cost of sacrifice and the cost of compromise.The screenplay is masterfully written and and the story carefully directed. So good is the crafting and telling of the story that the movie transcends borders - any audience can appreciate it. The art direction was very well balanced and added to the emotions the story brings out. Its only obvious weakness in my opinion were the few times it lacked continuity causing the editing of some sequences to be a bit awkward.For those who believe that government knows best and the populace needs the government to care for its needs - they need to see this movie. For those who believe in individual liberty and freedom of expression and decent at all levels - they need to see this movie."
kdbrangood,"Jun 19, 2007",10/10,"The locations, sets, cars (& trucks), costumes and characterizations were all PERFECT!! My husband and I lived and worked in the former DDR for almost 10 years, and this movie brought everything back to us, as if it were yesterday. Because we were working in various theaters there, the theater people were very much like former associates. Gerd Wiesler's apartment and apartment building were almost like the one that we lived in for 7 years, except that our building had no elevator. The kitchen and linoleum were exactly the same as ours. His neighbors were much like the people who lived in our building. The television was just right. If they didn't want to watch DDR propaganda, they could flip over to ""MOSCOW 1"" to get Russian propaganda or American films dubbed in Russian!. We almost expected to see someone we knew in the crowd scenes. This re-creation was accurate to the last detail, even the sounds of the car and truck engines. The attitudes/feelings of the people were very true-to-life. BRAVO to the cast, crew, writer and director for this wonderful, poignant film!!!!!!!This DOES NOT contain a spoiler!"
Chris_Docker,"Apr 13, 2007",10/10,"Maybe you know the saying, ""Dance as if no-one were watching, sing as if no-one were listening""? I wonder why we say that? Is there something magical about privacy? Something that lets the spirit free? Our story starts before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The Stasi, East Germany's Secret Police, has refined its way of dealing with artists. No violence. Psychology. Persuasion. Surveillance. The lives of others are not their own. Most artists give up. Many commit suicide. Your best friend. Your lover. Georg Dreyman is lucky. He survives.The Lives of Others spans seven years - from 1984 to 1991. The first hour sets the scene so we are completely immersed in Communist Germany. Then Dreyman and his partner confront the fact that their lives are being compromised. The emotional intensity is in gut-wrenching contrast to the bland story so far. Finally, as the Stasi surveillance kicks in, they wonder if they can survive - or even if they want to.One of the film's strengths and weaknesses is that the characters are so believable. Dreyman is a sophisticated intellectual, a successful playwright. His partner, Christa-Maria, is an acclaimed actress. Then there's Stasi agent Gerd Wiesler, a heart-felt supporter of the communism, who is assigned to spy on them. Wiesler has a crisis of conscience and decides not to prosecute Dreyman. The Lives of Others has created debate and furore in Germany. Firstly, because the ex-Stasi now try to portray the regime as none too harmful. Secondly, because the facts show that, with the system of double-checks that were in place, no such character as Wiesler existed or could have existed. The film's director says it is about the ability of human beings to do the right thing, no matter how far they have gone down the wrong path. It seems like a good story (as long as we don't re-write history in the process).As I came out of a packed multiplex auditorium, I marvelled. People turning out in such numbers to see a subtitled movie. And so they should. But, its Oscar win (Best Foreign Language) apart, The Lives of Others is particularly poignant to British audiences. A poll published at the end of 2006 indicated almost 80% of us agree that Britain has become a 'surveillance society'.This is why The Lives of Others strikes such a chord. Thousands of new offences, limitations on freedom of assembly, on privacy, freedom of movement, the right to silence, and freedom of speech. Privacy International ranks the UK ahead of the US, Europe and most developing countries, as a 'world worst offender' for surveillance, and as 'an endemic surveillance society' (in the same category as Russia and China). We are by far the most-watched nation on earth, with a CCTV camera for every 14 people. Apart from such corrosive effects of surveillance (notably, in our film, on artists), new technology (including DNA and tracking of non-suspects) raises nightmarish possibilities of abuse. When disaster hits Dreyman's life, it is because a high-up official is abusing the system. Dreyman and Christa-Maria's lives are shattered, and he becomes determined to help expose the disease in their society.As I catch the bus home from the cinema (watched by more CCTV), I read a newspaper report of an Aberdeen University study finding tough government policies aimed at curbing Islamic radicalism are having the opposite effect. Since 9/11, Britain has eroded the principles it claims to be defending, and people fear (with some justification) that the Government's 'bottom-up accountability' is a blueprint for a 21st century version of a police state. A vicious circle? The Stasi had many more times the secret police that Nazi Germany had - but under a politer system. And modern technology even does away with the need for so many human operatives. The Lives of Others does not feature Gestapo tactics (and the Gestapo only had 30,000 secret police, against the Stasi's 200,000). This is the 1980s, and the Stasi are modern-looking officials, not hit-men. Most of them have been convinced that their work is for the public good.Dreyman is criticised for minor offences - possessing Western newspapers. It gives them a polite excuse to keep tabs. One perhaps thinks of the UK DNA database (the world's largest) that samples those who have committed very minor offences - or no offence at all. The official reason for diversifying surveillance on Dreyman is, ""lack of suspicious acts."" Our fictitious 'good man' in this multifaceted masterwork, (and to whom Dreyman eventually dedicates a novel) is in some aspects played by Ulrich Muhe. In a strange irony, Muhe has examined his own Stasi files - from the days when he was an actor in East Germany. He found his former wife had informed on him through the six years of their marriage. For Muhe, the Brechtian self-awareness that is referenced (but never directly used) in the film gives it a meaning beyond mere entertainment. The movie's style is mainstream - as if 'no-one was watching'. We just identify with what is happening on screen. But then we think about our own lives. Whether it is ""the grey men who ensure safety in our land"" or the emotional ties, and how far would you go to protect a loved one, or how far someone could go to mess with your head.Watch and listen carefully: the Lives of Others is a film that can cut deep."
HurricaneKid,"Jul 4, 2012",N/A,"I cant remember a more well thought out, intelligently observed and subtle screenplay, Hollywood take note here, people like to see smart films.I heard in his commentary florian said it took him 3 years to write the screenplay and I can say why. The thought behind it is rigorous and many points are taken care of wherein in other screenplays they are rushed or covered in illogical steps from A to B.The ink stain is a genius touch and something it so simple but yet so beautiful at the same time.The shame is Florian ruined his reputation slight with his follow up but I'm positive he will come back with a piece of work that will take him to the heights of this film.A first class effort."
paulclaassen,"Nov 29, 2019",7/10,"'The Lives of Others' is an interesting movie. It is dramatic, sensual, sexual and captivating, and offers quite a few twists and unexpected events.Sebastian Koch is very good as Georg Dreyman, a writer under surveillance. Unbeknownst to him, his love life, every day routine, and conversations with his friends - and even plans to smuggle a friend across the border - are being recorded, as his entire apartment is being monitored. Instead of reporting him, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler - who is in charge of the investigation - can't wait for his surveillance turn to follow Georg's life. Wiesler is excellently portrayed by Ulrich Muhe. One can't help but become absorbed by the characters, wanting to see and hear more.There's so much irony in the film. 'The Lives of Others' definitely deserves more than just one viewing. Although it might loose its appeal with a second viewing, it will still be worth it."
JoaoPovoaMarinheiro,"Jul 9, 2008",10/10,"I'm amazed. After watching and enjoyed 'Goodbye Lenin!', I've waited for another German masterpiece. I can't say anything about 'Der Untergang' because I haven't seen it yet, but saying something about this movie, that's already another thing, that's possible: amazing. Just amazing. Such an excellent movie, and one of the most brilliant and excellent masterpieces I have seen in years. This automatically entered my top 10 of all time. This will please the most prolific and most exigent movie lovers plus the drama and history ones, I have no doubt.First, what I really liked in this movie was how the reality is so well treated. The movie is cold blooded and shows with no disturbing how far went STASI before the fall of the Berlin wall. It just shows it and that's it, that's the reality. There's's no other ways to be told, it was like that. And this, I found it very interesting and I enjoyed a lot.Then the performances. These actors aren't very known in the movie business (for me, if they are well known, then I apologize my ignorance), but still, they achieve to deliver performances so realistic and so powerful, that simply amazed me and I think they brought a lot of depth to the movie, specially this being a drama. It really improved the movie's seriousness. For me Ulrich Mühe was the golden star in this movie, and I am sad for his death, because he really achieved something here. May he rest in peace, forever.Then the script. Excellent, no twists, and absolutely amazing as the writer managed to focus on a real theme, but also achieved to drop other themes, such as love and friendship, that in the end turned into back stabbing. And this opposition created by the director slash writer, was very, very interesting.So, 'Das Lieben Der Anderen', is really one of the best movies made in the last years, and I am sure, that it is also one of the very best of all time (IMdB's Top 250, you bet it deserves being there). This movie really got a point, and it's to denounce how far the STASI went. Sure, there were more politic polices, but what they did, wasn't normal. I at least, don't think it was normal. I mean...where were privacy and liberty? - 10/10."
jameslinton-75252,"May 10, 2016",7/10,"This was an interesting film for me. I didn't really know what to expect going into this film. I loved the dull, muted coloured scheme. It really conveyed the bleak living conditions within East Germany. Sure this film isn't the easiest to follow, but it is gripping and engaging. It is a revealing look into one of humanity's darker moments and it treats everyone involved with humility and respect. It is a powerful tale about a man caught in between loyalty towards his state and loyalty towards his fellow man. It is an understated, but very powerful drama.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/byRMDe"
burakparlak,"Feb 3, 2020",4/10,"It is a serious criticism through Democratic Germany that deviates from the main principles of socialism over time, first alienated to its people and then turned into a totalitarian, oppressive police state.Let those who love symbolic expression watch. Otherwise, you may find the movie unnecessary and boring. It is more than 2 hours and is unnecessarily extended.In the middle of the movie, you already understand what will happen in the end. The scenario has remained very simple, but the message to be given is good."
bt-wells99-1,"Feb 22, 2010",9/10,"I've read this film compared to Coppolla's The Conversation, both favourably and unfavourably, on the discussion boards here. It should be noted that the two films bear only superficial similarities, mainly that the protagonists are middle-aged surveillance operatives who get involved with a case.However the styles are very different. The Conversation is a classic, and magnificent, piece of 1970s US paranoia-thriller, the best kind of film which came out of Hollywood in that decade of scandal that signified for many, the death of the American dream. Das Leben der Anderen is an equally intelligent and artful film, but one (from what I can gather) typical of modern German cinema, drenched in a sadness about its past, featuring strong themes of divided loyalties and moral dilemmas, but hopeful (unlike Coppola's film) about the future. Less suspenseful and pacey than The Conversation, this is a tale that gives a human face to the victims of the Stasi in East Germany, and, although it keeps you on the edge of your seat, is more of a drama, more sentimental in tone.A wonderful film, its magic is in the feeling it generates in you for its characters, and the almost gentle tragedy that unfolds. A serious, well made and superbly (that should be underlined: superbly) acted film that isn't ashamed to tug at the heartstrings a little. Small wonder it won the Oscar for best film of 2006: I can't imagine a better film was made anywhere that year."
peter-springael,"Jan 13, 2012",9/10,"This movie is definitely one of my favorite German movies ever. I visited the Hohenschönhausen prison in East-Berlin some time ago so the opening sequence of this movie really hit me in the face because I know the place and the things you see in the movie were a reality not so long ago. The actors are brilliant. The script is perfect. The sets are historically correct and give you a good impression of how it felt to live in the DDR. Not really a ""feel good""-movie but a message to set the records straight about the DDR-regime and its StaSi-system. Even the difficult parts, like the fact that there are a lot of former DDR-officials who still don't have any regrets about what they did, are not skipped. A true masterpiece."
Ray H.,"Jul 3, 2009",10/10,"I loved this film a lot and want to rank it as No.1 since I began to see films 40 years ago. All the actors are good, and they must be happy to act in such a movie as the script is well composed. This film indicates we can be changed, that we can influence the others, and that the others might watch over us and might sometimes help us without informing us.The history of ""Stasi"" in the old East Germany is terrible and tragic, and many people must have become their victims. Still, this film gives us the courage and hope to believe in human being.I will definitely recommend this film to all my friends in the world."
ezzat-mohamed,"May 21, 2010",10/10,"i believe this is one of the greatest movies Germany has ever made.. i mean brilliant acting (specially Ulrich Mühe) he deserves an Oscar for it and he definitely deserves bigger audience. that being said, excellent script (great character development and flawless plot with a very satisfying ending), excellent directing, editing and even music. this movie has it all, it deserves a place in the top 5 of IMDb 250. By the way, for those who don't know, Florian Henckel Von Donnersmarck is a first time writer/director. i can't wait to see his next picture (the tourist with Johnny Depp and Angelina Jolie ). this guy is talented as hell. the lives of others is a must see.. just brilliant!"
luke-346,"Feb 8, 2008",9/10,"Set mostly in the 1980s and during the cold war, Das Leben der Anderen tells of the world created by the Stasi (the internal army by which the Socialist Unity Party kept control of the German Democratic Republic, aka GDR) and how GDR citizens lived in a world of repression. A state security captain, Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhn), is an expert in interrogating dissidents and is assigned the case of spying on a playwright called Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch). It is for this reason (of being a playwright) that he is put under surveillance. As Weisler's investigation progresses he becomes unwittingly aware of his own limited existence and empathy for those he watches ensues, taking precedence over his obedience and loyalty to the Stasi  so much so that he begins to falsify documents and lie about events in Dreyman's life. Regarding the films treatment of the Stasi, Das Leben der Anderen has caused controversy upon its release, especially in Germany with people comparing the members of the Stasi to that of the Gestapo, 40 years previous. Recent German history is littered with examples of the Stasi's uncompromising approach  some of which are still coming to fruition. In brief the Stasi spied on, imprisoned, and ruined the lives of anyone it chose and in the immediate aftermath of the war there were a lot of deaths or ""liquidations"" of opponents. In later years the Stasi abandoned this approach in favour of psychological torture and exile. They would routinely brake into peoples flats, steal underwear (to be bottled as odour samples) for identification purposes and use psychotropic drugs on those under house arrest, this would mostly happen due to tip offs from fellow GDR citizens turned informers, as once an informer certain liberties would follow. Artists and those of a creative nature (writers, poets, journalist etc) were a favoured choice of the Stasi and their work was often either stifled, scrutinised, compromised or even destroyed  similarities with the manner in which Nazi's burned books are blatantly apparent; the film also makes plenty of references to books being a source of provocation. Because of all this GDR citizens lived in world of fear and paranoia, as individuals they were afraid and suspicious of all those they met. It was, without question, a totalitarian society.Das Leben der Anderen is very low budget, but it is outstandingly written capturing the essence of people's feelings at the time  with some great lines being ironically delivered by a government minister, the greatest line in the film though has to be the last because of its emotional connotations. The direction and the cinematography capture a sombre and monotonous East Germany with its drab lighting and muted colours, perfectly illustrating the despondency of its citizens. Performances throughout the film are excellent, Gerd Weislers girlfriend Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is a joy to watch, most notably the uncomfortable anxiety she displays during a scene in the back of a taxi cab manages to be felt by all those watching as does her expression of guilt and betrayal towards the end of the film. The greatest performance however comes from Ulrich Muhn. The opening scene in Das Leben der Anderen shows him lecturing some students on the art of integration; he plays them a cassette of one of his own interrogations. The man on the tape complains of being tired, to which a student declares that it is inhuman to deny him his sleep. Wielser scribbles a mark next to the students name before he retorts  this act alludes to the possibility that this individual will face some sort of punishment for his remark. Weisler continues teaching and, in accordance with the cassette, states that a guilty man will become quiet and reiterate his rehearsed lies, whilst an innocent man will shout and scream. This behaviour and this carefully constructed scene beautifully underpins the Stasi regime, it sets forth and establishes the type of character Weisler is, whilst allowing for the understanding that any deviation from this way of thinking results in you becoming an enemy.Das Leben der Anderen is an outstanding accomplishment because of its proficiency at utilising old-fashioned narratives and placing them into a malevolent world - that was once real. Unfortunately it tells of a story that did not occur (the director and his researchers underwent four years of research for the film and could not find one example of a Stasi man empathisising with dissidents or even suspected dissidents) and although accurate in many other areas the films core values are untrue and almost propagandarous. To assume that a man like Weisler could change his beliefs questions the very understandings of a totalitarian state, it ignores historical accuracy to feed cinema's desire to misrepresent and fabricate history for the purpose of entertainment and it is this that is simultaneously the films strength and its weakness. In a nutshell the film is about hope, it is a word that is mentioned a lot and it is something that propels the characters and narrative forward and it is how the story finally resolves itself - by pandering to this sense of hope. Despite its short comings, Das Leben der Anderen is one of the first films to look back at the GDR and not reminisce or gain humour from it (""Good Bye, Lenin!"", 2003) and it treats them with heavier hand than many other German films to date, but it also lets them off lightly. I am a strong believer in film as an art form and had the film been more truthful to itself then it would have been an incredible piece of art, but in sticking with recent trends laid out by current German film-makers (a common attribute of New German Cinema) the film has fused both art and entertainment thus leading to Das Leben der Anderen being just an incredible piece of entertainment."
etteriv,"Sep 12, 2007",N/A,"These comments relate to a DVD rental. This is undoubtedly an incredibly well crafted film with an excellent musical score. The special features include an impressive presentation by the Director on the making of the film and his spoken English is evidently flawless. However after thirty minutes or so of watching the film, I stopped it and removed it from my player because of the exasperating inadequacy of the English subtitles. It appears that just about twenty-five percent of the dialog is subtitled and much of the subtitles presented appear to be just summations of what is being spoken rather than word for word translation. For a film of this quality to have such inadequate subtitling is really sad. I realize that reading subtitles and watching a film can be really difficult, but, realizing how much dialog is being missed here is most troubling."
benjamin-petrinec,"Jun 16, 2013",7/10,"If you are in one of those foreign movies phases, I would recommend watching this.It has its depth, and its completely realistic.People living under a socialist regime, are brought to the belief that their country is protecting them.They trust the government in everything, and the ones that think differently are evil, and should be removed.This movie is a portrait of the bad aspects of living in a Socialist country. There are good things I'm sure, but don't expect them in this movie.7 out of 10, not really for the masses, but for people that can understand how it is living under constant pressure."
searchanddestroy-1,"Mar 19, 2022",10/10,"Whatever the director will make after this film, I am sure it won't be better; good, yes, but not better. This pure gem is one if not the best film ever made about life in East Germany, at least spoken of in the Western side of the former Iron Curtain. Far from being a simple propaganda film, it is a subtle, powerful, brilliant, intelligent and pulled by a jaw dropping acting too, though the actors are known outside Germany. I am not surprised that it was so widely seen over the world. It is accurate and thrilling, scary and poignant in the same time. It is impossible to think about something else after watching this film. Another movie, however, was also a pure masterpiece, but told on a lighter way: GOOD BYE LENIN, speaking of a cousin subject, related to the East West Germany problem, but told from another angle."
imagiking,"Jul 5, 2010",7/10,"A movie I'd long been intending to watch, Das Leben der Anderen has many accolades to its name, not least of all its Oscar. Add to this the generally intarnishable excellence of modern German cinema, and you have a sure recipe for entertainment.An exploration of Cold War Germany, Das Leben der Anderen is the story of GDR espionage officer Gerd Wiesler in his duties spying upon playwright and actress couple Georg and Christa-Maria. Initially a faithful servant of the East, Wiesler is slowly romaniticised by the ideals subtly instilled within his subconscience by those he surveills.As one might expect from a film set during this era, Das Leben der Anderen is heavily political. We see this immediately expressed through several characters, primarily Wiesler. Cold, austere, and unemotional, he shows us the filmmakers' view of East Germany and its agents, conveying to us the sinister notoriety of this infamous entity. It takes perhaps half an hour of the film's running time before we observe a trace of humanity within the character: a veritable needle in a haystack of socialist stoicism. The gentle unravelling of his personal life is wonderful, giving us a detailed picture by showing a blank canvas. As Wiesler's vacuous life of monotony and iciness rolls on, the shared life of his assigned targets seems ever more appealing, the romance between them something entirely foreign and unknown to him. This juxtaposition, purveyed through colour schemes of respective apartments as well as the actors themselves, is for me more appealing than the film's significant political commentary. The extent of the effect of Georg upon Wiesler, despite the fact that they never actually meet, is fantastically enthralling, slowly coming to show us the human side of the previously authoritarian figure. Undoubtedly, the praise for this belongs to Mühe, his performance calm, collected, and capturing. As well as the gripping characterisation, the film's plot is involving; a well paced drama that effectively shows us life behind the wall. The film is rife with subtle but touching moments, beautiful in their simplicity and impact. Not least of these is the closing line, its delivery absolutely perfect and hard-hitting. Tonally, the film is consistent and insistent, evidencing the eagerness of von Donnersmarck to tell this important story.Accurately portraying the concomitant fear, uncertainty, and disillusion of the GDR's command, Das Leben der Anderen propels us effortlessly into the world of its characters. Slowly and comprehensively crafting a complete picture of its main character, one which gradually affixes itself forever to our affections, this is a very fine film indeed."

monitorizare2001,"Jun 13, 2013",9/10,"If you want to know how was it to live in a so called socialist country in central/eastern Europe in the 80's, this is the movie to see. It's the most comprehensive mirror of that time period that I've ever seen. Whether the name was STB, Securitate, KGB or Stasi - in this case, the movie contains a very realistic portray of the secret police and the surveillance methods used. The movie deserves a better score, is a 9+ movie, I think some people gave it a lower score only because of the dark atmosphere, which I consider is very realistic. Ulrich Mühe, who unfortunately died in 2007, gave here one of the best portrayals of the 'watchdog', a policeman without a personal life, that lives only to spy 'other people lives'."
russian-movie-fan,"Jan 13, 2008",10/10,"This is a phenomenal piece of film-making. A rare gem and a must see for anyone who has an interest in serious dramas. One of the best films that you will ever see...it truly leaves an impact...The music, the acting and the story will keep you glued every minute till the final resolution... If only the Oscars considered foreign language films for the main best picture nomination, this one would easily be a winner! Primarily its a story one man's inner struggle with himself and his duty to his country...but as the decisions he has to make become progressively complex throughout the movie, the more of the inner struggle takes over him until he is forced to make some hard decisions that will end the lives of others. What will he do? What is the right thing to do? Can you make choices without people being hurt or killed? These are questions that every character in the movie has to answer in their own way, and that answer will decide whether they live or die."
Marc_Israel_365,"May 17, 2015",9/10,"Artists watching this will shudder at the callousness of politicians and at how little they mean to government, unless the all-mighty entity decides they need something from you. What could that be? Your loyalty, your voice, or possibly your girlfriend or to shut your voice down when they care to. When that has been decided, no action is too grotesque. NSA hating liberals will simply see this as a universal film to justify their cause against humanity. I used to say that as long as I have nothing to hide, why should I care? We all have our agendas, apolar from Gods' will. What a sad existence our characters found themselves in as East Germany was artistic quicksand. This touching film allows us inside each persons mentality from disgusting politician to bully spy to idealistic writer to actress subservient to her desire to perform to the career saving autocrat who carried out the ""business"" at hand. Each is powerful but none are in true ""concert"". This is why to break the stalemate created by selfish leadership, it all begins with one good man."

The subtle, yet powerful characterization is one of the most spectacular I have seen in any movie and it will leave you crying for some characters, and completely loathing others.Even if you aren't too fond of subtitles, put up with them for this film.

WriterDave,"Feb 26, 2007",8/10,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others"" is a searing portrait of East Germany in the early 1980's before the fall of the Berlin Wall. The era of paranoia, suppression of free speech, and total state control of everything and everyone is masterfully displayed here in the intertwining stories of the Stasi police officer, his morally questionable superiors, and the actress and playwright they are spying on. Once again, the German people's love affair with authoritarianism and meticulously detailed records is featured here as the most intimate details of these people's lives are examined and we see the quiet tragedies of their everyday life stemming from their bizarrely married desires for freedom and attempts to rationalize their place and survive in the State and the Socialist movement. Superb acting, an excellent music score, and no-frills direction keep the film taut, sparse, and utterly transfixing in its evolving melodrama.On an obvious surface level, ""The Lives of Others"" is the most psychologically astute look at voyeurism since Hitchcock's ""Rear Window."" What makes the film compelling in its slow build up of tension and suspense, is that it is working on so many other levels. It can also be viewed as an allegory for the art of film making (or stage directing and writing) and the craft of acting, as we see the fractured psyche of the Stasi police officer--much like the blacklisted director character who commits suicide-- who so desperately wants to intervene and direct the troubling lives of those he surveys (the writer and actress--both wrestling with their own internal demons as their lives soon become not their own). So while it serves well as a timeless psychological case study into such minds, desires, and paranoia, it also functions as a very timely discussion about how much interference a government has the right to run into the lives of ordinary citizens.""The Lives of Others"" suffers from one major flaw, which will not be discussed at length for fear of giving away some of its intricate plot twists and theatrical climaxes. In the end, the film misses the final beat as it runs about ten or fifteen minutes too long past what would've been two serviceable and profound endings to arrive at a series of closing scenes that are all too pat. The first two hours were so rife with dramatic irony and subtle tension, that it's a shame the film rolls on beyond what would've been a sublimely ironic and stark conclusion (that arrives at a most pivotal moment in world history). Still, there was so much multi-layered and engrossing minutiae in those first two hours that the film's ultimate brilliance can not be denied because of one false note."
pedrohms,"Apr 16, 2022",N/A,"For some moments in the movie I was astonished, either with a speech or a scene and I felt so dived into the plot that I didn't want to blink my eye. Each scene was worth watching, the story unrolls very poetically and brillant.Each time something was about to happen I expected something meaninful that would make me feel something important about the movie and it did every time.People can be surrounded by evil but be able to do good to others and be relevant in their lives."
aopscreening,"Nov 12, 2007",7/10,"I am happy for the German film business which is doing better and better, and Americans like this movie even though it's not about Hitler! But I think it is a bit too sentimental. It tells a touching story, but of course it takes the story of a Stasi who is really ""good on the inside."" But I would rather see a movie about the truth, about how the stasi was mostly not so moral. But I guess it's nice for people to see, because they think that if they were in his shoes, they would also be ""nice."" But the movie never really explains why he decides to be a good person, so it's just ""boring guy is a good guy""...I think it is better in subtitles, because in German it felt sort of obvious, but when you read subtitles you think it must mean more!"
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Jul 3, 2009",10/10,"This is a spell-binding film. Absolutely captivating. Before the Berlin Wall fell, Stasi conducted surveillance on anyone they suspected of harboring thoughts and opinions against the Communist rule of Eastern Germany. We follow a man employed by the DDR to listen in on a specific household, and how he gradually becomes emotionally attached to these two people that he, unbeknownst to them, is recording the actions of. This gives a psychological and realistic look at not only the people who are the subject of a constant invasion of privacy, but also those who are responsible for it. There is tremendous authenticity, in this. It is dramatic, engaging, suspenseful, and, frankly, beautiful. The plot is excellent, and develops rather well. This has spot-on pacing, and it's never boring. The acting is beyond reproach, every single performance in this is stunning. All of the music and score fits. The writing is incredible, the credibility, the characters, the dialog, the scenes... I could go on. Since I only followed what was said from the subtitles, I cannot comment on whether or not there is harsh language in this. There is sexuality and nudity, and I would say that a certain maturity level is necessary to appreciate this anyway. The DVD holds a trailer, some previews for other movies, a showcase of the actual equipment used and several interviews, all of them worth the time. I recommend this to anyone who has a chance to see it. 10/10"
wy-90259,"Jul 6, 2020",7/10,"With the latter half of his life, the ideal, silent and firm man was born, and finally he only got ""Sonata for good people"". Sometimes choosing to stick to one's own path is exchanged for happiness."
nturner,"Nov 8, 2008",10/10,"I begin this review by quoting Jesse Vint III. Mr. Vint is a character actor seen in numerous films and television programs. Of The Lives of Others, he states, ""This film slowly gripped me, but by the end, the grip was merciless."" I couldn't have said it better. That's why I am borrowing Mr. Vint's words. As a matter of fact, when I first started watching this film, I was thinking that it wasn't going to be worth over two hours of my time. I soon discovered that it is worth far more. It turned out to be a deeply personal experience for me as it reminded me of certain shattering events in my own life. I actually had nightmares last night relating to those events which, I'm sure, were aroused by viewing this extraordinary film set in East Germany a few years before the fall of The Wall.The element of the film that caused me to continue to watch even though I first thought that I was not going to be entertained was the depiction of the lead character, Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler played by Ulrich Mühe. Mühe's interpretation of a man who appears totally devoid of emotion is hypnotic. The character Wiesler is an officer in the Stasi - the secret police in charge of following the movements and activities of every person the country.The Stasi employed some 100,000 people to keep track of some 16 million citizens. In addition, the Stasi had a huge network of unpaid informers reporting the activities of their friends and neighbors. Imagine - one person to spy upon and report the lives of just sixty people. Horrifying! Mühe is an actor who grew up in East Germany and was the victim of both the Stasi and ""friends"" who were informers. That surely had to add to his insight into the character of Wiesler, but whatever his resources, his performance is surely one of the finest ever recorded on film. Wiesler is a man so imbued with Communistic doctrine and devotion to the state that he has become an observation and interviewing machine more than a man. There is a revealing scene early in the film in which Wiesler summons a prostitute to his house. He sits on his sofa with his shirt buttoned to the top, trousers and belt still fastened, while the prostitute plies her trade - machine sex. The only hint of any human emotion is at the end when he buries his head in her ponderous breasts. At this point in the film is when I began to feel sorry for this pitiful man rather than hate him for what he does.Wiesler is assigned to observe a famous playwright who has always openly supported the government - but why? We find that Wiesler's superior is having an affair with the lover of the playwright - a beautiful and famous stage actress - and wants the playwright out of the way. The motive behind the observation goes totally against the principles to which Wiesler has devoted his life and career. Thus we see a seed planted that will grow to change the life of this man. That change takes place as he observes the lives of others.Along with this totally breathtaking film, the DVD contains features which truly enrich the viewing experience. Through these features, the viewer is treated to the history of the research that went into the film, the writing process, the historic locations, and the thoughts of the actors. They are not to be missed.If you are reading this review, you probably have an interest in film. As a film viewer, you must see The Lives of Others."

The HGW XX/7 has a real dignity and the way he turns and separates his way from meanness to heroism is unspeakable. He doesn't talk too much and never gets to talk to Dreyman. The soundtracks are really fit into the sequences and the movie gives you the feeling of being ruled by dictatorship.It is also thoroughly instructive how Georg Dreyman treats his wife when he finds out about her compulsory affairs with the minister. That's the right way to handle these events in life.It deserves to win the Oscar and even a better award if existed!"

As foreign film Oscar winners generally tend to be a good show. This was beyond expectations.Ulrich Mühe puts on a compelling performance as a state security police agent. Sebastian Koch is equally impressive.I highly recommend you make your way out to the film festival theater that is showing this movie. You will be amazed."
marissas75,"Mar 31, 2007",10/10,"Since the early days of film-making--actually, since the first plays were written--the gold standard for a good dramatic work is one that combines an intriguing plot with complex characters, to illuminate something about human behavior. It's surprising, then, that so many movies still fall short of the mark. At the risk of oversimplifying things, plot-heavy movies tend to ignore character development, and character-study movies ignore a streamlined plot for the sake of a series of episodes. It takes something like ""The Lives of Others,"" an excellent and moving drama, to remind you of how great a movie can be when it combines these elements.Not only does this movie have a suspenseful plot that follows the logic of cause-and-effect until everything ties together beautifully, but the workings of the plot are unpredictable, and intimately linked to the characters' psychology. For drama does not result merely from watching external events happen to characters, but from seeing them actively make choices that affect their own lives and (forgive the pun) the lives of others.The set-up is simple but highly resonant: in 1984 East Berlin, by-the-book Stasi agent Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned to wiretap and listen in on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). But because Dreyman has always presented himself as a loyal citizen, Wiesler dimly begins to realize just how paranoid and corrupt his government is. Also, he becomes fascinated with the couple's warm, semi-bohemian lifestyle, which contrasts with his own solitary existence. Wiesler thus finds himself reconsidering his values, while at the same time Georg and Christa-Maria reconsider theirs. Should Georg use his writing talent to reveal the horrible conditions in East Germany? Should Christa-Maria submit to a lustful government minister, who could ruin her career if he doesn't get his way? These choices are hard, and only lead to more hard choices.This plot allows for scenes loaded with the great dramatic irony and subtext that results from one character knowing something that another does not. The movie's complex and intelligent themes include theatre/fakery/acting versus real life, and the voyeurism of a spy versus the voyeurism of a cinema-goer. And above all, ""The Lives of Others"" is a moving exploration of ethics and humanity. Not many recent movies ask the question ""What does it really mean to be a good person?"" and even fewer answer it with the honesty and depth that this film does.""The Lives of Others"" does not over-explain itself--none of the characters can confide in anyone, so they make their difficult choices without talking about why they've acted that way. Yet everything that happens in the movie has the ring of emotional truth. Thanks to the beautifully realized performances, you never doubt that the characters would behave in exactly that way, nor that they feel deep anguish in coming to their decisions.I haven't seen all the acclaimed movies from the past year yet, but as it stands now, ""The Lives of Others"" is my choice for the best movie of 2006."

JakeBrinkman,"Oct 31, 2019",6/10,"An extreme tale of subterfuge in the face of an oppresive government, one man finds the courage to make the world a better place, risking everything in the process. It's hard to imagine taking such a risk knowing the government is probably tracking your every move. Muhe (Wiesler) acted very well, forced to live vicariously through the people he spies on, desperately hoping for the same kind of personal connection that they have. In a world so closely monitored, the only retaliation one can take is relatively minor, so it's never a very thrilling or dramatic film. It also doesn't manage to capture the covert back-and-forth or hidden intentions as in great spy movies such as Red Sparrow. Despite the slow pace and muted events, I won't soon forget The Lives of Others."
ejderkelebek,"Apr 14, 2007",4/10,"I did not find this film that much stunning. The book story is alright but the films on Germans do really have that much reputation if you make a movie on anything it will be OK. I do not think that film is a great one. Yes you can watch it with a talkative guy even while writing a word document or surfing in the internet. The film is really slow. T-I do not mean a low film is not a good one. But this film does not have that much inside it. Moreover in this slowness you do not find anything poetic, literal, or gorgeous cinematography. Just ordinary shooting and very ordinary story. Do not watch alone. Read a spoiler. Enough. The story is good."
bandw,"Oct 20, 2007",10/10,"Artists are dangerous to dictatorships as this film so ably proves. A work of art, such as this film about life in the GDR, has the power to influence opinion in a way that history books cannot. In the interview with director Donnersmarck on the DVD extras he mentions that he spent a year and a half doing research for this. He read everything he could on the GDR and conducted extensive interviews with former GDR people, including ex-Stasi agents. Many of the actors are East Germans including Ulrich Mühe who was himself under surveillance by the Stasi. All of this reflects Donnersmark's stated desire for authenticity, down to using original surveillance equipment and filming some of the final scenes in the actual Stasi archives. In any case, if we were to abstract this story from any basis in reality and view it as fiction, it is still powerful. By concentrating on a few individuals it presents a chilling view of the effects of living in a repressive dictatorship. I found this movie to have a keener effect on me than Wells' ""1984.""The movie poses the question of what a good man is to do when living in a fascist regime. Those who wield the power have the techniques down as to how to control the citizenry - threats to family, threats to job, brutal interrogation, and even torture. If someone knows enough about you, it is a trivial matter to exploit your vulnerabilities to keep you in line. How much would you compromise? How much would you risk in order to be true to yourself?The most fascinating aspect of this film for me deals with the moral dilemmas faced by its two main protagonists - the theater director and writer Georg Dreyman and the Stasi agent Hauptmann Wiesler who sets up full surveillance on Dreyman. Both are torn between loyalties to their professions, their county, their friends, and ultimately each to his own conscience.Mühe plays Wiesler with subtlety - he turns in an awesome performance primarily achieved through facial expression and body movement. His gradual transformation is wonderful to behold and there is enough ambiguity to keep you guessing as to the causes. Does his surveillance of Dreyman provoke jealousy, sympathy, sexual longings, shame, enlightenment, all of these, or what? And Dreyman's transformation is no less interesting, albeit more easily understood. If you like movies where events change people, you will like this.The colors are a bit drab - grays, greens, and browns. But they reflect an implied drabness as to what life was like in the GDR. I wish there were more commentaries on IMDb from those who lived through this.The musical score offers a perfect backdrop.""The Lives of Others"" is absorbing and virtually flawless."
sidneywhitaker-1,"Jul 11, 2007",10/10,"Among all the qualities of this honourable and distinguished film, one should mention the SILENCES, in which the viewer's imagination can ""READ"" for him/herself, in different ways, the deeper levels of mental turmoil and sensitivity which are often excluded from rowdy, sensational films.Such silences leave room for subsequent discussion, among fellow-viewers, of the possible, probable, and improbable feelings of the characters, their motivation, and evaluation of their conduct and attitudes. With the increasing necessity of ""governmental"" supervision of the conduct and habits of a population, the attendant threats to human autonomy must be constantly be realised."
louisamimmack,"May 31, 2007",10/10,"The first mention should go to the actors, who gave such engaging and moving performances. The plot and directing are superb, in fact it is incredibly hard to fault this film.The topic of the Stasi in East Germany shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall is one I have only seen dealt with in the more light-hearted ""Goodbye Lenin"". ""The Lives of Others"" portrays a far more dark side to the regime. I defy anybody to find a reason not to like this film, as the message goes far deeper into investigating the impact of espionage upon human relationships and emotions. The ending is amazing, and without giving too much away it is implicitly simple in its insinuation of the bond which has formed between the two principle characters.If you only see one film this year, make it this one. I was over-whelmed at the end which is incredibly unusual for me."
leftbanker-1,"Aug 27, 2014",10/10,"I watched this movie again after reading Anna Funder's book, Stasiland, about life in East Germany under the paranoid psychopaths of the state security police. The film is a masterpiece of tragedy and hope and the triumph of good.One of the most moving scenes in this and in any movie is when he discovers that his copy of Brecht is missing which, of course, has been nicked by his nemesis/deus ex machina in the Stasi. We cut to him reading it at home. ""Can anyone who has heard this music, I mean truly heard it, really be a bad person?"" From what I have read about the Stasi I doubt that anyone would have talked freely on a telephone line in this era but I could see how the writer, after years of keeping within the party lines, would think that his home was not under surveillance.""To think that people like you once ruled a country."" I had the same thoughts during the Bush/Cheney years in America."
jamesjustice-92,"Nov 21, 2020",10/10,"I watched this movie 10 years ago for the first time - today was my second, and barely anything has changed: Das Leben der Anderen is still a true masterpiece and one of the best movies of the 21st century. I am amazed that Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck could have created something as powerful as this fantastic motion picture but then again I remember that he was the one behind Werk ohne Autor (2018) and, having checked his filmography, I see that he literally hadn't created anything in between those movies and I start to believe that miracles do happen, just not often enough. Das Leben der Anderen tells a story of a Stasi officer who is absolutely perfect at his job; he can crack anyone and he knows every bit of human psychology there is to know about to do the job well done, but the only person he wasn't able to have cracked turned out to be himself. There are a lot of things that we regret to have done but there are just as many that we regret we haven't and our whole life builds up on those deeds, right and wrong turns, and in the end all that's really left to ask yourself is if you can live with yourself despite everything you've done. After the movie's over you're left with this question on your hands too. 12/10."
GiraffeDoor,"Mar 15, 2020",6/10,"Austere, leisurely, but admittedly very well made examination of conscience and people risking everything in a culture of fear.Everything about this is professional and note perfect and if you have the attention for it (unlike me) then you are in for a real treat.I think this was the first non-anglophone I ever saw all the way through."
TheSmellyMoo,"Sep 11, 2011",2/10,"I was looking forward to watching this film due to it's high rating on IMDb and Rotten Tomatoes, but it was a total waste of time.The film was thoroughly boring, nothing much happened in the time available and anything that did happen was done in lack-lustre way.mise-en-scene was convincing bleak however.I was expecting to happen to turn it around, but I was disappointed.More violence from the stasi would have made it more ""real"".Also showing a contrast with 'the west' would have made the viewer more sympathetic with the stark reality of the eastern bloc.I found the choice of characters rather dull.Just plain boring. wouldn't watch again."
jamesomullane,"Jan 29, 2020",10/10,"Another honourable mention, which also didn't make my top 30. This film is phenomenal. The loneliness of Wiesler, the charm of Dreyman, and their close yet distant relationship is captivating. The oppressive backdrop of a very grey east Berlin coupled with the soft, warm feeling of Dreyman's cozy apartment provides incredible emotional weight. This is bound to provoke strong emotions in any viewer. Lots of great performances here, notably Ulrich Mühe. He plays his part with delicacy, as if he is trying to let the audience determine how he feels"
ruoshi,"Aug 7, 2018",10/10,"Without been in China, in 2018, I would not fully understand this great film. I have seen it many years ago in China, during college maybe, did not consider it anything special. But now, after living in US for 5 years, come back to China and saw this film, it's heavy. People here are under state surveillance in the most extensive way for whatever they say through internet. They complain offline, they escape the country like me, but not much people fight back. Now I realize, we Chinese citizens deserve all this, all of us, and this film explains my point."

Hayud_Farah,"Aug 21, 2025",10/10,"The Lives of Others is a deeply moving and emotional film that brilliantly portrays the sadness of individuals living under the tragedy of East Germany's socialist regime. The story of a playwright whose life is touched by the harshness of an oppressive state, where corrupt individuals use power for personal gain, reflects the ruin inflicted on an entire population. A film everyone should watch to understand why freedom is precious and must be protected."
resireg-31415,"Aug 24, 2017",10/10,"I just love cold war movies, but this one is seen not from the American/British perspective, but from the people who were on the other side of the Iron Curtain.In the movie, we get an idea of how it was to live in a country that feels like a prison (first rule: if you try to emigrate, they will probably arrest you, torture you, and even kill you or if you succeed, go after your family and friends). Despite so much oppression and terror, there is some intellectual life, with plays, music, books and some discreet bohemian life.But the problem is that the secret police is everywhere, and being a freethinker will cause you trouble. The movie is essentially about an efficient police operative, who slowly regains his humanity tries to help a couple that is going to be arrested soon, and he is the one responsible for spying on them.The movie is a piece of fiction (we don't know whether there were cases of good Samaritans among East German police), but it feels almost like a documentary. I was happy that they won the Academy award for best foreign movie."
RResende,"Oct 15, 2008",N/A,"One of the living thinking minds i most admire is George Steiner. He is a man of great intelligence in the way he knows why knowledge is meaningful, and why it is important to Know. Among the many issues that have been a constant concern in his thinking life, one has been with me all the way since Steiner showed it to me: the brutal contradiction between human actions, or how he would put it; how can someone cry over night deeply moved by a Schubert Sonata, and in the next morning coldly order the killing of thousands of people.This fundamental issue was vivid in my mind all the way, throughout this happily depressing film. There even is a direct reference to this question in it. So the theme here is how the meanings of art, or the simple reference to it can influence a mind trained to not be influenced and mechanically not behave humanly. Minds trained to trust what they're taught.The way this is put together is with one of the most subtle cinematic constructions i have (ever?) seen. The focus is on the artists, repressed artists, subjugated by a repressive regime. In the world framed in this film everything moves around them. Those artists are watched, constantly. We watch them, and in that watching we have the company of someone whose job is literally to watch. He starts with cold inhumanity (the first scene establishes that), obsessive watching, which that regime would probably consider simply 'professional'.In the way he gets involved with the subject of his watching (artistically modeled lives). Several things underline this: Art bends his mind to the point in which he plays double and starts writing an invented story to protect the real story the play writer is writing; He steals a book from the subject he's watching, and secretly reads it at home; he asks a prostitute to stay with him longer than the deal would require, basically to be more than sex. Ultimately, he rewrites the ending of the whole story by hiding a forbidden object (a typewriter!) and thus secretly entering and changing the life of the artist.This is a perfect expression of the dangerous of true commitment to true art, the art which embraces ideas that matter.The camera is subtle, it moves most of the time, its movement doesn't call attention, but always add up to the tension, mostly with subtle travelings. And watch the use of space. See how the interior of the apartment is used, how the cinematography carefully captures all the nuances and how they enlarge and diminish the inner space, in accordance with what the characters feel. Than notice how the humanity of that coloured environment is contrasted with the attic where the watcher stands, and even how he abstractly recreates the space below, from the sound of it.Ulrich Mühe really had a deeply moving and intelligent performance. Very sad that he left us so early, here he really is something to look at, and performs fully in the field that most impresses me: that of subtlety, that kind of acting of great expression out of imperceptible moves. Most of it is in his face, so many times carefully framed.The aftermath of the thing is when the artist writes a book, supposedly about the story we just saw. As if the film we had just seen was in fact made from the book. I was lucky to watch such a film. what a privilege.Most of the times, i appreciate a film for its qualities as a vehicle for new/interesting ways to pass a story, or for how its visual quality/presentations gives me themes to dream about. This one works on the both previous aspects, but does it in a theme that matters. That's so rare.My opinion: 5/5, watch it if you want to feel more human.http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
oneloveall,"Aug 17, 2007",7/10,"Donnersmarck's much talked about film is certainly an impressive debut, pitting a suspenseful tale of political intrigue against East Germany's ultra-shady governmental proceedings during the mid-late 80's, but as per usual with most films containing any sort of bona-fide talent these days, remains over-hyped and over-rated. ...And a little overlong as well. Eventually many of the fairly dumbed-down script's (though certainly not by American mainstream standards) plot-twists become unimpressive, leaving me almost apathetic nearing the final stretch of character ambiguities. The film does end on a high note, rounding out some of the former repetitious tension (an oxymoron, no doubt) and lengthy chronology on a fairly just note. Just another one of the thousands of examples of excessive and lavish praise being heaped on a certain project, thereby dwarfing the effect from high expectations. The Lives of Others may gently explore many potent themes remaining crucial in our society today, though the film itself felt underwhelming to it's rewards ratio."
Benjamin-M-Weilert,"May 23, 2020",10/10,"Quantum Physics holds to a belief that you can never truly observe something without affecting it. The mere act of observation alters the state of the thing being observed to the point where we can never be sure of the accuracy of the observation. I say all this to set the stage for the wildly tense and enthralling Best Foreign Film Oscar-winner, The Lives of Others (2006). There's this weird dichotomy between voyeurism and being able to play God that makes this film so entertaining to watch, especially in the modern, surveillance-heavy society in which we live today (of which Person of Interest does an excellent job of exposing).Set in one of those rare historical moments right before the fall of the Berlin Wall, The Lives of Others hinges on the superb performance of Ulrich Mühe as the audience is never quite sure what he's going to do with the information he gleans from the individuals living beneath his surveillance station. There are vibes of Rear Window (1954) and Doctor Zhivago (1965) in The Lives of Others. The former speaks to the voyeurism and what one can do if they see or hear something that shouldn't be seen or heard. The latter dives into revolution and how entangled romantic and artistic lives can become with it.Aside from some fantastic and almost heartwarming plot twists, the suspense in this film is palpable. This suspense is only heightened by the incredible soundtrack that amps up the intensity when the audience knows what the people under surveillance do not. In the end, though, stories like this help emphasize the importance of individuals who see what's wrong with a regime and comply with the rulers...up to a point. Like Schindler's List (1993) before it, some of the true heroes of revolutions are those who are employed by the enemy and make it a point to be a force for good.An expertly filmed exposé on state-mandated voyeurism, I give The Lives of Others 5.0 stars out of 5."
Moviespot,"Jun 25, 2007",7/10,"I enjoyed watching this film.I Liked it's kinda ' slow ' tempo...the rhythm of the movie.... The greatest Actor in it IMO was The guy who played Wiesler...the Stasi apparatchik who at the end showed he still had a ' feeling heart ' left for the life of other people.The end was touching to me...( where he finds the to himself dedicated book by Laslo...)I found the portraying of Life in the DDR well executed...the burocratic inhumane atmosphere in which folks east of the German wall had to live...The everyone is listening - choking - sphere....One scene , imo , was'nt too well done ....the scene where the 'betraying' actress runs out of the apartment and got killed by an on-storming truck.then we see laslo coming down and holding the dying woman..after that the Stasi gang comes out of the building and are reacting very unnatural IMO to the scene that plays in front of their eyes....

The oppressive feeling is there, the indiscriminate distrust, the mutilated human relationships. The second pair of eyes, the hamstrung friendship, the crippled love, the despair, the humiliation. It is not an easy voyage back, but it's worth every second of it for reminding us that any oppressive system needs our eyes and ears.

chomskyreader,"Jul 20, 2007",N/A,"i sat in the theatre for the entirety of the film waiting for that moment when i would be impressed, moved, shocked, or even just interested.......it never came. once about 30 to 40 minutes in to it is when i first said to myself ""this is supposded to be a brilliant and exciting film, and im utterly bored"". although subtitles can be blamed for taking some people out of the dramatic or even comedic films i have to date not been affected by subtitles, laughing out loud at ""boss of it all"", ""amelie"", and almost coming to tears during ""dreamlife of angels"". so that was not it. i just found this movie to be un-original, un-inspired, and poorly thought out. which ironicly is what most critics are praising it for. it had all the themes of a normal American thriller; good guys vs bad, government vs artists, big brother listening in, bad guy surprisingly learns lesson from good guy, etc. etc. if keifer sutherland and meg ryan played the lead roles in this with ed harris as the secret agent, this would be blown off by many critics im sure of it. but add some dramatic lighting, foreign launguage requiring subtitles, and set the film a few years back and suddenly all the art houses are flocking to show it. i honestly cant find one redemable quality in this film, one thing that i can say i learned or that they did well or that was new in any way. the plot has been done in different variations before, the actors were horrible (overacting in every scene), and the ending was about as Hollywood as it gets (to go into too much detail would ruin the ending, but basically good guy finds out bad guy, isn't so bad after all). i wish i could end this review by showing some way i share in the perspective of all the other critics who loved this movie, but i just plain cant. i thought it was awful, boring, poorly made, and offensive that so many American theatres are showing and praising it."
8k-iptv-provider,"Sep 15, 2025",6/10,"The Lives of Others is a profound, chilling, and ultimately heartbreaking masterpiece of modern cinema. Set in the suffocating atmosphere of 1984 East Germany, the film is less a Cold War thriller and more a deeply humanistic exploration of the soul's resilience under relentless oppression.The genius of the film lies in its quiet, meticulous focus on the watcher, not the watched. Ulrich Mühe delivers a career-defining performance as Stasi Captain Gerd Wiesler, a man whose unwavering belief in the system is slowly eroded by the very humanity he is tasked to dissect. His transformation is not marked by grand speeches, but by minuscule, breathtakingly subtle shifts in expression-a glance, a breath, a moment of hesitation. It is a silent performance of immense power.Writer-director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck constructs a world of muted grays and greens, where every surface seems to hold a secret and every conversation is layered with unspoken fear and suspicion. The pacing is deliberate, building an almost unbearable tension that comes not from action, but from the terrifying quiet of a listening device and the moral decay it represents.This is a film that questions the very nature of art, loyalty, and what it means to be human in an inhuman system. It is intellectually rigorous, emotionally devastating, and flawlessly executed in every detail-from the authentic production design to the haunting piano score.Verdict: A tense, intelligent, and deeply moving triumph. It is not just a film about East Germany; it is a timeless and essential warning about the fragility of freedom and the corrosive nature of absolute power. An unforgettable cinematic achievement."
petarmatic,"Apr 16, 2014",8/10,"In 1984 I was a teenager in Sarajevo being entertained by the Winter Olympics of that year. I could never think that life in the East Germany was so not free. We were never told about this in the former Yugoslavia. Since we had a free travel possibility to the West, GDR considered Yugoslavia a capitalist state?!? Only after the Wall fell we understood the real horrors which East Germans who did not follow the Party line had to endure. At the same time it was very interesting how those who followed the Party line enjoyed good, almost an excellent life.At the same time it shows how the ones who were high, fall so low as the system changes. And the ones who were low climb high. (Who was high falls really low, and who was down climbs really high, wheel of fortune does not stop rotating!)All in all an excellent film, for all those interested in the GDR and Stasi it is a must see!"

I would assume it is the only reason for why I have never heard of it. If you are fan of classic movies like 12 angry men, American Beauty and so on I would definitely recommend this movie. A lot of meaningful dialogue and character development. The characters are well written, the plot is solid, the acting is great. 10/10."
HLX1992,"May 13, 2020",9/10,"Today I watched the film for the second time along with my friends. After so many years, most details of the film have faded away from my memory, leaving only blurring sihouelletes. The altruism of the Stasi agent is one of the only impressions that remained unwashed before the revisit. However, this time what attracted my attention was not only the heroic act of Wiesler, but more keenly on the living state of those who suffered from a Orwellian society that they had no power nor courage to change.The main factor that may have reshaped my impression towards the film is my visit to North Korean last year, a regime whose first name is also ""Democratic"". As a consequence, I have had this surreal experience while those characters are walking around those bleak stone buildings in the dead of night, since I have also tried, albeit the discouragement of my guide, to take a walk on the street in Pyongyang after dinner. The tram, the quiet pedestrians who walked around, the deadly atmosphere were somewhat ignited in me, though most of them do not really bear any resemblance to the scenes in the film. My guide panicked after my disappearance from the hotel for about 15 minutes and summoned a few other guides to search for me. I was duly admonished on being found, and reminded that secret police might also be wandering the streets at the same evening, expecting an unexpected encounter with some hapless tourists who dare to step outside the prescribed realm. I was only to learn the story of Otto Warmbier after my brief adventure into the heart of DPRK, which gave me quite a shock when I look back at some of my casual behaviors that could have been perceived as disrespectful.I have gone on a tangent line here. I don't think it's a movie review anymore."

Schwag09,"Sep 7, 2016",9/10,"The Lives of Others is a German film that tells the story of two artists living in East Germany during the height of the Cold War. The Ministry for State Security, or Stasi, knows no limits to its surveillance power and has taken a special interest in the artistic community. Despite their unwavering faith to each other, we play witness as these two lives become further and further intertwined with the State Security. The Lives of Others will leave your heart pounding and mind racing as you become engrossed in a world of deceit and passion. The plot is methodically revealed to you in such a way that you're aware of where you're headed, but shocked when you get there. It draws you in and leaves you feeling as though you have truly peered into – the lives of others.Georg (Sebastian Koch) is a playwright who walks the line between obedience to the Party and his moral compass. He frequently surrounds himself with intellectuals with more fervor than he, but manages to stay on the Party's good side. Change is a constant theme throughout the film and Georg's life is no exception. As he slowly sees his world crumbling before him he becomes more and more impassioned. A dear friend hanging himself is the catalyst for a shift in Georg's writing style. After such a traumatizing event his close friends no longer seem so radical.Christa-Maria (Martina Gedeck) is Georg's girlfriend and actress in several of his plays. Their romance grows as the film progresses and leaves them both feeling as though nothing else matters. However, her flourishing acting career has garnered her some attention from the Stasi. She too is forced to choose between allegiance to the State and her moral well-being. Throughout the film her choices have the most impact on others. Although unreliable at times, we feel inexplicably drawn to her. Her presence on-screen is intoxicating, which is perhaps why we see events unfold as they do. Despite all evidence to the contrary we choose to trust where she takes us.Weisler (Ulrich Mühe) is a veteran of the Stasi and prisoner interrogation. A slave to his own stoicism, he leads a simple, calculated lifestyle that revolves around his allegiance to the State. He is well-versed in taking people to their breaking point and his latest assignment is to surveil Georg and Christa-Maria. As he immerses himself in their lives he begins to question everything around him and everything he's ever known. He travels deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole until he's completely lost his sense of up and down, and right from wrong. If Christa-Maria is the catalyst for change then Weisler's transformation creates the largest explosion.The Lives of Others leads you through a tangled web of interactions and leaves you feeling as though you yourself have been ensnared. Ulrich Mühe delivers a captivating performance, perhaps the best of his illustrious career. Overall the film was one of the best foreign films in recent memory, and was recognized as such. It won Best Foreign Film in 2006 after narrowly edging out another of the great foreign films in recent memory – Pans Labyrinth. Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck brilliantly commands the pace of the film through the lens of the camera, the claustrophobia inducing sets, and the haunting score. This film is definitely a must-see."
nesfilmreviews,"Oct 17, 2013",10/10,"Similar to the communist witch hunts that alarmed American's in the 1950's, ""The Lives Of Others"" offers a riveting view of life behind the Berlin Wall. Director von Donnersmarck engages us in the life of a cold, dispassionate character then takes us on a journey that transforms him from detached observer to involved partisan. The film is careful to avoid overt melodrama, but at the same time, it engages the emotions. Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the movie is the complexity and intelligence evident in the screenplay. The unique angle of the film is in itself unusual, a thriller that follows the villains.It's 1984 in East Berlin, and Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Muhe) is a secret agent of the Stasi who investigate civilians suspected of undermining government authority. That's why when Stasi Capt. Wiesler first sets eyes on playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), he doesn't like him. Dreyman, by all accounts, is a loyal socialist, but the captain sees the playwright -- handsome and self-possessed, at home with himself as he watches his latest play -- and pronounces him ""arrogant."" Dreyman is a happy man -- an artist in love with his work and with another artist, a great actress (Martina Gedeck) -- and that in itself makes him an enemy of the state. Though von Donnersmarck accords Dreyman and Crista a fair amount of screen time, their roles are simply to act as catalysts. This is Wiesler's story, and although there are moments of tragedy, it's ultimately one of redemption.Wiesler is a fascinating character, a blank slate if you will, trained to reflect no emotion whatsoever. As played in Muehe's performance of infinite subtlety, he watches Dreyman as a cat awaits a mouse. He begins to internalize their lives, because he has no life of his own; no lover, no hobbies, no distraction from his single-minded job. Wiesler has no one he can really talk to. His gradual transition from loyal soldier of the state, to a man embracing emotions for the first time is the film's most compelling aspect throughout. The seduction depicted in ""The Lives of Others"" is inadvertent, and it's the allure of the beauty found in art, the exploration of the meaning of life, and the possibility of love, all of which are absent from Wiesler's existence. By listening to Dreyman and Crista, he discovers the potential of a more fulfilling existence. Eventually, his desires leads him to protect the couple, even though his actions violate the law, and places his career in jeopardy.The strength of ""The Lives of Others"" is that it works on numerous levels - especially in the way it approaches Wiesler's complexity as an individual, and that none of the characters are one-dimensional. An arresting drama from first time director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, accompanied by phenomenal performances and a terrific screenplay. Oscar winner as Best Foreign Language Film."
beatrock-97080,"Jan 27, 2019",N/A,"The Film is loosely based on the life of GDR Author Christoph Hein to which Donnersmark spoken for some hours in 2002. After seeing the movie he was very disapointed of the movie. The GDR was a unjust state and the infamous Stasi is a fact to. But the description of life and work in the 1980 GDR was very different, to that shown in the movie.
I'm German and of cause proud when a fellow countryman wins an Oscar, but not in this case. And now, 2019, knowing the other Donnersmark Movies ""The Tourist"" and ""Werk ohne Autor - Never Look Away"" (based on the life of German Painter Gerhard Richter - who hates the film and took distance), I must say, it went downhill for Donnersmark from there. Americans seem to love this kind of history telling, since ""Never look away"" is an Oscar nominee in 2019."

It's a very well put together film, with great acting, cinematography and cutting.The writing is also incredible, showcasing some very important messages and delving into this time period and its dilemmas in eye-opening ways. It's an important piece to help people remember.As an artistic work of art, it is, as stated above, also very well worth checking out. The director is acclaimed, and I have watched many of his works. He knows how to gracefully work with all the right components in terms of technical and artistic themes.It's very well worth checking out indeed."

sezahp,"Jan 2, 2023",10/10,"We watched this movie after visiting the Stasi museum in Berlin, and I was astonished as well as frightened by how many things the movie portrayed which I had seen in the museum.This movie is about the police in DDR during the division of Germany, and it tells the story of two men: one, a police officer, the other, a playwright.Although a little unrealistic, the plot is heartwarming and heartbreaking at the same time; it deals with a lot of tragedy, but also positive aspects such as goodness or helpfulness are being portrayed perfectly.Especially the last line got me...
Recommendable to all."
Billy_Boy_,"Jul 16, 2025",8/10,"Why can't German cinema put out bangers like this anymore? From todays perspective it's great to see that Germany was able to make an incredible movie like this not even two decades ago.The Lives of Others really is one of the greatest German films ever made: It's tense, and emotionally powerful without ever feeling forced. It also manages to capture the whole paranoia and quiet dread of life in East Germany like nothing I've ever seen, all without being flashy or overly dramatic - just very grounded.The whole cast is great, but especially Ulrich Mühe who delivers a near perfect performance as the cold Stasi officer starting to question the system he's upholding.Man, now I'm really feeling nostalgic for a time when German film aimed this high and wasn't mostly putting out bad, unfunny comedies all the time."
chaos-rampant,"Nov 19, 2010",N/A,"I had no idea the world of The Lives of Others would fascinate me so much. I don't give much cred to Oscar winners, foreign or otherwise. Yet I was lucky to grow up in a country that just barely escaped the iron grip of communism but at the same time one that existed just outside of that reach, every now and then the Iron Curtain would be lifted and something would filter through, groping violently in a society that is still deeply class divided to this day. I didn't live through the Dictatorship of the Proletariat but I remember Zastavas and Ladas and old beatup Yugos in the streets and Gorbachev in the news, and a few days ago, on the 17th of November, we celebrated the fall of the military junta of '68, a totalitarian regime that existed on the backs of its own type of Stasi and oppression of human rights. This is still fresh and emblematic in our national memory, so this film hits home in ways someone born in America is lucky never to have to deal with even in retrospect.If I like this so much it's because it's something at once familiar and otherworldly, mysterious and horrifying because some of the features are known to me but not the whole, because it takes place in cold empty streets and gray apartment rises all identical to one another that remind me of cold Berlin neighborhoods I visited, characters groping for identity and expression in surroundings that deny them. It's all very crushing because ideology is not the end but the means by which selfish men can pursue selfish goals, because a figurative heaven where things for Georg and Marie would be fine exists in the very same city, just outside a dividing wall, across the street. Streets are empty because something keeps people from venturing out, and I like how that urban desert of fear and suspicion is shown to seep inside living-rooms, behind closed doors a malevolent presence groping blindly and unseen there.The only thing amiss here for me is that The Lives of Others tries to exist in a state of matter-of-factly observation. I would love to see a Zulawski version, character emotions swirling in violent storms, or one made by a New Wave minimalist, where faces are mute and the silence deafening. Von Donnermarck's movie is a little too concerned with going with the flow of established filmmaking, of what is immediately expected and accepted by this type of film. I wanted to see it make breaches with the audience, to be difficult and not give us all that we want. The storytelling is perfect but at the expense of that poetic extension where things are allowed to linger in the mind and be metaphors, enigmas, mysteries haunting and supine.The marvelous thing about it is that it has amazing characters. I like how they not only rise to moral standards in affirmation of the human spirit but also fall from them with the same affirmation. Marie's final betrayal is crushing, she sells both soul and body, and it's tragic because she's damned even before she's allowed that choice. I like how the film doesn't end with the cathartic note, with the bang. We're given the echo, the aftermath. The regime has fallen but the former minister still attends the theater, still wearing an expensive suit. That malevolent presence has seeped out, it always does to fight another day. Former DDR politicians now have lucrative careers as advisers like former KGB officials in Russia are now political barons. But the failings of a political system that cheated people on the base of ideology are shown in chilling detail, and more, the lives behind all that, with their small triumphs and follies, crushed by that system but with that small beacon of humanity, pride or dignity, still intact."

Really excellent drama and some skillfully applied suspense.
Much deeper than just a Stasi cat and mouse game.
High praise for this by many who claim familiarity with the East Germany of this era, so, apparently the authentic feel is actually, um, authentic."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 4, 2025",9/10,"Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck's ""The Lives of Others"" (2006) delivers an absolutely gripping and profoundly moving drama, immersing viewers in the chilling world of East German surveillance and the quiet humanity that resists it. The film excels in its masterful storytelling, building unbearable tension through its meticulous portrayal of a Stasi agent's transformation, creating a consistently compelling and deeply resonant cinematic experience. Ulrich Mühe delivers an unforgettable, nuanced performance as the surveillance agent Wiesler, embodying his gradual awakening with breathtaking subtlety. Its strength lies in its razor-sharp script, atmospheric direction, and its powerful exploration of morality, empathy, and the enduring spirit of freedom, feeling authentic and contributing significantly to a timeless narrative of redemption. Instead of a mere historical drama, it offers a searing, unforgettable, and endlessly rewatchable film.Is it worth watching? Absolutely. ""The Lives of Others"" is a cinematic masterpiece and a must-watch for anyone who appreciates intelligent, character-driven dramas and films that explore profound human experiences with unparalleled artistry and intensity."
Falko_h1,"Jun 14, 2024",7/10,"""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives of Others), directed by Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, is a compelling drama set in East Germany during the 1980s. The film delves into the oppressive atmosphere of the GDR, where the Stasi, the secret police, monitor and control the lives of its citizens.The story centers on Captain Gerd Wiesler, portrayed by Ulrich Mühe, a dedicated Stasi officer assigned to spy on a playwright, Georg Dreyman, and his actress girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland. As Wiesler becomes increasingly immersed in their lives, he finds his loyalty to the regime tested and begins to question his own beliefs and morals.What makes ""Das Leben der Anderen"" stand out is its meticulous portrayal of surveillance and its impact on human relationships. The film is a slow-burning, thought-provoking examination of power, trust, and redemption. Ulrich Mühe's nuanced performance is particularly noteworthy, capturing Wiesler's transformation with subtlety and depth.The film's somber tone and meticulous attention to historical detail create a hauntingly realistic depiction of life under a repressive regime. While the pacing may be slow for some, the powerful narrative and emotional resonance make ""Das Leben der Anderen"" a profound and memorable viewing experience. It's a film that leaves a lasting impression, reflecting on the complexities of humanity within a system designed to strip it away."
baesuk81,"Jan 6, 2013",1/10,"is this supposed to be a movie of ""1984"" by George Orwell? if this director or writer made this movie with that intention, it is not bad. but if the director or the writer claims that this is their original? then it is the worst ever. i just can not believe no one talks about that this movie is exactly the same as ""1984"" novel by George Orwell. every single aspect. fact that the secret police wants to know everything. so they eavesdrop all their conversation. and the list goes on and on... in fact, one person on rotten tomato mentioned about ""Brazil"" by terry gilliam. Terry also said that he never read the book on an interview. i thought it was the biggest lie. he should really be ashamed of what he made. that is just the biggest bullshit. even if you didn't read the book, other people must have read the book. i can not believe that he didn't get sued for that movie. and this movie is even worse. at least, terry made it to be a little different. but this movie even starts at year 1984. how crazy is that? how can no one see that? and everybody is talking about how creative it is? because George Orwell wrote it 60 years ago. i am just so terrified at north American's inability to read anything and saying what is really creative... what a joke."
yiyuantiming,"Apr 24, 2020",8/10,"The serious introspective film ""the lives of others"" continues the strong speculation and unambiguous critical spirit of German cinema since the 21st century. The rather ingenious story frame allows the 132-minute film to always maintain a high concentration of viewing attention. ""the lives of others"" can integrate ornamental and serious themes, which is no easy task nowadays. It wasn't until the end of the highly restrained but unmanageable self-sustainment that the audience felt the author's ingenuity, and thus through all the details in the film"
InTheBackdropOfOblivion,"Mar 4, 2017",10/10,"""Your missing this film means you necessarily did not live another human dimension of life"". That's my simple suggestion,if expected,when it comes to this film.This probably is one of the films directed from first to last minute with the highest degree of intelligence and consciousness a human being can afford or perhaps have ever attempted to exercise. It's worth almost of fifty other films combined and you will feel that glint of humanity that is sublime,instinctive yet here is in distress and being challenged in such an overwhelming way that has only to be felt,ever represented in a film perhaps in the whole of film history.It can test one's breaking points,shake one's core principles that one snuggles deep inside.It teaches what humanity is with grueling and sometimes deeply undermining a test.It can break and penetrate one,it can lacerate one,it can consume one if one believes himself to be a human and;even if he doesn't believe himself to be human,this film will recommend that,that disbelief or desensitization is artificial and imposed thus is not inherently human and can afford to let a man be wavered.It is capable of stirring one's human feelings irrespective of the extent of exposure,hardening to inhumanity one has been or can be imagined to have been subjected to."
ElMaruecan82,"Mar 26, 2017",10/10,"""Beat your wife regularly, even if you don't know why, she will."" I doubt the Arabs really invented that saying but it seems like every totalitarian system was based on the idea that no one can make you feel guilty without your consent. Stasi didn't spy on potentially guilty people, but people were guilty already of that suspicion.Stasi: a simple whisper of that name was enough to send shivers down the spine of millions of citizens of the German Democratic Republic. It is not even far from reality to say that the population was divided in two: those who were spied and those who spied, some could slip through the net but for how long? The Stasi used spying and intimidating methods that had nothing to envy from the way Gestapo could treat the German population, and the opening of ""The Lives of Others"" sets the tone.Wiesler, a Stasi agent, is giving a course. He explains to his students the virtues of keeping a prisoner awaken for forty hours, the so-called arrogance he displays will inevitably be broken. With a no-nonsense didactic tone, he reveals all these little tricks that allow the police to spot the guilt, an innocent person will shout in rage, a guilty one will weep and beg for mercy, a truth will be formulated in different ways but a lie is always made of the same lines. It is tragic that such methods existed, and even more that they sometimes worked.With cold detachment but impressive competence, Wiesler says more about the Stasi than a one-hour documentary, and from the start, the young director Donnersmarck shows a remarkable attention to small details. Notice the scene when a student questions the humanity of the methods, everyone can see Wiesler putting a cross under his name but it's not in the mark, but in the discreet and smooth way he does it and then immediately answers the question. Notice also the prisoners asked to keep his palms on the chair so that the sweat on the cushion can be used for bloodhounds, this element never serves the film but it conveys one crucial element: the Stasi has an eye for detail, and so should we, if we want to appreciate or understand what happens.This attention to detail says even more: anyone could be submitted to surveillance on the basis of suspicion, something that doesn't feel 'right'. When Wiesler is invited to see a play from writer Dreirman (Frederick Koch), all it takes is a simple look at that handsome long-haired man with an opened shirt, and a lovely woman, actress Christa-Maria (Martyna Gedeck), to suggest an investigation. Dreyman did nothing wrong but he's too well-established to be totally clean and something about his friends doesn't feel Kosher, so the Minister (Thomas Thieme) approves, moved by selfish reasons. His last feat was to forbid acclaimed author Gershka to work, when Dreirman defends his friend, the Minister denies such things happen and invites Dreyman to moderate his words.Yet Gershka is the specter of what awaits Dreyman: losing your job, your contacts and the freedom to leave the country, not that everyone wanted to leave Germany, and the height of irony is that many artists were socialists (and would never be as creative as under the totalitarian regime). The veiled threats of the Minister, the situation of Gershka and the relative comfort bourgeois Dreirman lives in, are so many parameters to take into consideration, it's all about choices that jeopardize your life, it's a choice he has to make, and in the movie, choices are often driven by fear. It is very interesting that the biggest ""thrills"" of the film come from situations where we fear for the protagonists, so we have a taste of what life under this regime was.But what makes the story so unique is that we have two persons who couldn't have been more opposite. Dreyman represents life, conflicts, torments, problems with his work, friends, life, courage or lack of, while Wiesler is a professional agent: he's alone, all dressed in gray, has sex with prostitutes, it is like his existence has been totally dedicated to his job, but by following the daily life of Dreyman, a strange juxtaposition of feelings occurs, he starts to discover a strange one some would call ""empathy"". The film then becomes a character-study about a man who supposed to study people and we witness his slow but progressive coming-to-realization on the tragedy that people live. There's a magnificent scene with a little boy that shows how Wiesler's foundations are being shaken, for the best.Now, what is exactly ""Lives of Others"" about? Some would suggest that it is the intrusions into people's private lives and the lessons for today's generations, why are we so content to share our opinions and private lives on social media while they can backfire at us? And what lessons can the free world give when the threats of aggression from the exterior are always served as excuses to intrude into people's private lives? Recently, my Facebook account was blocked because I used a nickname, I'm supposed to send them an ID card to have my account back, that alone gives me an idea of how deeply attached to my privacy I am. Perhaps the worst aspect of the Stasi is that it is somewhat relevant today, in this post-9/11 world.Or maybe the film is simply about goodness and humanity? About the fact that a malevolent presence can as well become a guardian angel, because it takes to get deeper in people's lives, to feel their flaws and weaknesses to realize the extent of the harm... On many levels, the film is inspirational and no one can't resist to the ending, a magnificent visual epitaph from Ulrich Muhe who sadly passed away one year after the film, but whose performance enriched the lives of the ""others"" that we -movie lovers- are."
gradyharp,"Mar 2, 2007",10/10,"Das Leben der Anderen (The Live of Others) is a powerful film that opens a window to the West of what life was like in East Germany during the time of the Berlin Wall. It is a tense yet balanced work by newcomer writer and director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck who manages to present a tense story of espionage, suspense, intrigue, and political danger without the need for car chases, explosions, gunfire, or any of the usual accoutrements that pulse through other stories of this nature. Instead von Donnersmarck shows us the interior lives of his characters, both those working with the East German government and Secret Police and those who struggled to survive individuality. One of the primary jobs of the Secret Police (Stasi) was to spy on informers and those who would leak information about East Germany to the West. One fact that was kept under lock and key was the high rate of suicide, especially among artists who could not bear the crushing eye of the Eastern police, that would be devastating information if leaked into the press of the West: this forms the nidus for the story of this film.It is 1984 and one agent - Captain Gerd Wiesler (Ulrich Mühe) is assigned the duty of spying on popular playwright Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch) and his live-in girlfriend, brilliant actress Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck). Dreyman is a friend of blacklisted director Albert Jerska (Volkmar Kleinert) and when Jerska commits suicide Dreyman feels compelled to get in the information to the West into a popular magazine in hopes that action will be taken. Wiesler alters his spying routine when he discovers that the Stasi official to whom he reports has different designs on Georg and Christ-Maria and his spirit shifts subtly in support of the artists. It is this inner struggle within Wiesler that alters the manner in which his spying information is reported and Wiesler's courageous deeds alter the Secret Police plans to destroy the artists' venture. The manner in which Weisler interplays with the Stasi and covers for the artists is a towering example of the dignity of the individual human soul threatened by the worst of circumstances. The results of Weisler's decisions alter with the fall of the Wall in 1989 in a deeply touching yet very subtle way.The technical aspects of this film - cinematography, pacing, lighting, editing, and the splendid musical scored my Gabriel Yared - are as fine as any film created by seasoned directors. The manner in which von Donnersmarck keeps every actor focused on the inner personality, as much by body language and silences as well as by dialogue, is astonishingly fine. This is a fascinating story, told with elegant understatement and most worthy of the Oscar for Best Foreign Film. Highly Recommended. Grady Harp"
keenanchris,"Jan 19, 2021",9/10,"2006 was a vintage year for films; you only have to look at the nominations for best picture and best foreign language film - all of them great movies. But, The Lives of Others edges it for me.Parasite has set a precedent for a film in a foreign language winning the major award. I believe if the academy had adopted this policy earlier of including all films for consideration when choosing the top prize, then this would have won the best picture Oscar for 2006. Highly recommended!"
johnnyboyz,"Nov 20, 2009",7/10,"The world in which The Lives of Others is set is a grey and frightening one; one that evokes fear, suspicion and tension. It takes place in a world and at a time that really existed; and amongst the vast, vast annuals of history - the period, or 'era', of mid 1980s East Germany is a fairly recent time and place as to which dramatic events should be observed as they play out. We may not be looking at a period in history that shaped how the world would turn out; nor indeed are we focusing on individual events or wars that formed new nations and beliefs - rather, the focus is on a handful of people and how their own lives are shaped by the state. The Lives of Others is more of a minute piece, it has that cold and intimate feel to it; that precise sensation of something being studied and etched out playing out amidst the Soviet controlled nation that was East Germany in the not so long ago late 20th Century.The film is ten times the piece the recent Bourne sequels are. As a film exploring the practise of eavesdropping, spying and espionage; director Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck opts for the polar opposite approach by painting a very grim and ominous backdrop of the time and setting via the cinematography, and constructs his film in a slow and very precise manner. Perhaps slow is the wrong word, I'm thinking more along the lines of 'calm' and 'patient', evoking a very visceral sensation for a lot of the time that reflects the action of spying and eavesdropping: a calm and patient approach to a task that takes time.The film is the second of recent times from German film-makers exploring Germany's past and identifying past ideologies and beliefs. The other is Die Welle (The Wave), a film that explored the fanaticism and national interest behind politics and how seemingly easy it was to install a charismatic leader, garner attention and form minority factions amongst everyone else. The Lives of Others is a piece exploring Germany's past Communist driven areas, almost the whole of the East in particular, and how power; paranoia; gradual obsession and seemingly absurd political demands can lead to fear plus the actual eventual demise of people's lives.The film is a series of exchanges between three primary individuals; a game of power play if you will. Sebastian Koch plays Georg Dreyman, a playwright living with a certain Christa-Maria Sieland (Gedeck) in East Germany, circa 1984. After attending one of his plays and observing the goings-on, Gerd Wiesler (Mühe) is adamant the above writer is suspicious enough to warrant a number of bugs be fitted to his apartment so that spying can be carried out, and observations made. When we are first introduced to Mühe's Wiesler, a lecture he is giving to budding students of the secret police are studying the arts of interrogation; an interrogation which is being revealed in tandem with the speech as the young learners watch on. The following scene sees Wiesler himself as an audience member, watching on from the confines of a balcony as a play gets underway. The notion of watching-on is made aware early on to us, that parallel between students observing a lecture and picking up on things followed by the teacher himself observing a performance and having his suspicions is apparent.Mühe plays Wiesler to an absolute tee. His performance feels detached from the rest of the film, but in the nicest possible way - the manner in which he plays the character gives off an uncanny sense about him, as if he has stumbled in off another production. As everyone else around him performs to whatever degree they see fit, Mühe elevates his character onto another realm; echoing what other actors such as Hopkins and Bardem did in The Silence of the Lambs and No Country for Old Men, respectively. He comes across as colder than everyone else, as if he's been beamed in from another far off place. Wiesler is extremely robotic in his actions and movement, constantly clad in grey and neutral colours and nary giving much away by way of facial expressions. The man is creepy and mechanical in movement and professionalism; he speaks in short and to-the-point sentences and phrases. There's an odd scene in which he is caught asleep during a late eavesdropping session on Dreyman and his partner by the guy on the next shift; after which he gets up, thoroughly embarrassed and somewhat ashamed that he's been caught looking like a human being.The film will branch out into all sorts of bother for the leads, in the sense illegal publications of articles on suicides and unregistered typewriters will be the order of the day. The film touches on themes of honour and guilt as Maria gets involved a little too deeply, and certain revelations cause Wiesler himself to question where his loyalties lie. Drenched in a metallic, stone-cold look and with a Best Foreign Language Film Oscar under its belt, The Lives of Others is an interesting and brooding period piece that shines thanks to its impeccable directing, individual acting performances and menacing narrative complimenting its menacing aura."
sonofgodtrujesus,"Feb 26, 2007",10/10,"This film was better than The Last King of Scotland, The Departed, and Little Miss Sunshine combined. Its the best film I've seen in a decade. This film was gushing sexuality, anxiety, and extreme alienation, seriously, after watching this film I thought about seeking professional help. I fell in love and became intiamtely attached with all the characters. Mankind have invented some pretty useful things but thisfilm shows us an invention of a social system on par with, say, the atomic bomb. I actually felt relieved walking out of the theater,knowing that this tense, suspenseful and gorgeously done, emotional nightmare was over. The human element is so beautiful and this film give us a glimpse of what it feels like to be human. Definitely in my top 20 of all time. Awesome!"
stensson,"Dec 29, 2006",8/10,"It wasn't long ago, that this was a reality. DDR, a paranoid country, with Stalinist views, wanting to know everything about everybody for the safety of itself.Ulrich Mühe is absolutely brilliant here as the very strict Stasi captain, who changes bit for bit. He really starts to live the live of others. Not because he's in a claustrophobic state of mind. But he's the watcher who is conquered by what he watches.There are many clues in this movie, which you come to think about afterward. In a way just like the Stasi captain. This is another example of German film coming back on its previous high level."
moviemanMA,"Mar 25, 2007",9/10,"You enter your room. Everything is fine and where it should be. Your coat is on the rack, your partner in the shower, and your cigarette still smoldering in the ashtray. Behind the walls and under light switches there are microphones and wires running into someone's headphones. You are not alone.Neither are the people of East Germany. In Das Leben der Anderen, we get to hear what goes on and who is doing the listening. Translated, The Lives of Others is exactly what it says: it's about the lives of others, someone's life other than yours.Throughout East Germany in the 70's and 80's, wiretaps and surveillances were placed amongst civilians considered to be a threat to the government. They would interrogate these targets until deemed necessary or when the information they wanted was acquired.Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler is a member of the Stasi, the secret police of East Germany. He and his colleagues suspect a local writer Georg Dreyman of conspiring against the government. Georg and his girlfriend Christa-Maria Sieland, an actress in Georg's play, live together in harmony. Behind Georg's back, she has been seeing a high ranking government official to keep her name and her husbands ""hush-hush"" so they may live peacefully. All is heard through Wiesler's headphones.After a 20 minutes sweep of the apartment, all areas of the home are covered. Wiesler's men work swift and efficiently. It is obvious that this is not something new but very routine. In 20 minutes they have managed to find all the necessary locations for their equipment to be placed, work correctly, and be unseen to the untrained eye. Wiesler finds a perfect place for his operations to be located: right above the cozy apartment.Everything is in place, the pieces aligned, and mikes turned on. Operation ""Lazlo"" as it has been dubbed is ready to go. All they need is to hear one mention of treason and they storm the building and take them away. Easier said then done. Wiesler's friends get involved and so does Wiesler. One element wasn't accounted for in the briefing: compassion.There are several moments in the film where you feel bad for the people involved. Wiesler is spying on people who he comes to admire and wants to help them. In the opening of the movie, we see him teaching to a class explaining the proper technique to interrogating a person. His ruthless tactics and harshness towards his comrades make him seem almost inhuman. As the film progresses we see more of a compassionate and touched person than before.Georg and Christa have their own problems and to top it all off, their friends who have been black listed and spied on realize the danger that everyone is in. Their are eyes everywhere and no one knows where, except the only place that is considered a safe haven is Georg's place which ironically is the one being monitored.Technically it is very sound and very well put together. The editing is flawless, going from the attic with Wiesler listening to Georg's apartment and the actions going on inside. What really makes this fantastic story work is the acting. Brilliant performances from Ulrich Mühe (Wiesler), Sebastian Koch (Georg), and Martina Gedeck (Christa) boost the intensity and drama of the story to a new level. Another standout performance comes from Wiesler's friend, coworker, and overseer of the operation Oberstleutnant Anton Grubitz played by Ulrich Tukur.The power and energy of The Lives of Others stems from the time period that it takes place in. The people are cautious and aware that they might have some unwanted visitors listening in. What is one to do when they can't leave the country but if they stay they are in danger?"

Great to see the old East German streets and the sets seemed very authentic. The visuals and music really pull you right in. All in all, the movie left me thinking about it and feeling it for a long, long time later.

bobbrownct-128-430127,"Aug 8, 2011",N/A,"I just watched this film on BBC2 last night, had never heard of it before but was captivated.I never went to the former DDR until last year, but worked in West Germany at exactly the time portrayed here, the mid-1980's, height of the Reagan area. There was a huge feeling of rivalry between West and East Germany, every product which by then was coming over from the ""Ostis"" was derided in West Germany. There are also hints of the former tension between Prussia, and Saxony which was 100% in the East. Certainly any report in ""Der Spiegel"" would have triggered such a fury in the ranks of the East German regime at that time.I met someone who had just come over from the East, working in a factory. He was genuinely scared, like the guard in the canteen, of making jokes about the regime, in my case I made a joke on a tram ride with him about the USSR football team beating Hungary 4-0.To me the weirdest part is the STASI typewriter-expert, who can tell where all the official typewriters are and what makes etc. What happened to this kind of nerd when the Wall came down?All in all a gripping film, well-acted."
CinemaSerf,"May 11, 2024",7/10,"This isn't so much a thriller as a glaring example of the corrupting power of the state, and of those charged with crafting and implementing it's policies. ""Dreyman"" (Sebastian Koch) is an East German playwright who is popular with the communist elite because his works manage to extol the virtues of their people's republic. The minister ""Hempf"" (Thomas Thieme) goes through all the supportive motions with him, but meantime asks the Stasi to keep an eye on him. The very ambitious ""Grubitz"" (Ulrich Tukur) selects his meticulous colleague ""Wiesler"" (Ulrich Mühe) to manage the surveillance and off we go. What dawns on them very quickly is that they are being used by the politician to discredit the writer for an altogether different reason. He has designs on actress ""Christa-Maria"" (Martina Gedeck) who just happens to be the girlfriend of their new quarry. She has very reluctantly agreed to his advances in the past, but on the basis that resistance would be pretty futile as he is not a man to be crossed. If they needed proof of that, they just have to look at the ostracised ""Jerska"" (Volkmar Kleinart) who is now reduced to living in a glorified flat share and who cannot get any work. The hitherto unshakeable loyalty of ""Wiesler"" starts to wobble a bit now. He dislikes being used and as his surveillance continues, he realises that maybe his targets are not the right ones! Gradually, the internecine and political elements close in on all of them and as pressure grows to deliver results, things take a tragic turn for just about everyone. It's quite a potently paced and cleverly written indictment of totalitarian regimes, this. The people live in fear and so conform; the state controls all aspects of the infrastructure of daily life and those who have climbed the greasy red pole soon display all the Orwellian credentials of his ""Napoleon"" from ""Animal Farm"". Plaudits must go to Gedeck who plays well the conflicted character who must juggle her love and her life and to Mühe who shows that as a former master of the indoctrinating arts, ""Wiesler"" too might be capable of change. Of humanity even. There's a fun scene where one of their colleagues is telling a joke about Erich Honecker and is accidentally overheard. We see him again later - but neither character is doing the job they signed up for!"

It is a very naive film, a very naive plot\story. Though the ending is good. His girlfriend turns out to be a whore? A stupid whore.The story isn't much interesting, much intriguing to me. I don't really get what's so great about it.The world of GDR, shown in the film, has reminded me the Russian classics.

I've heard even more disgusting things about the socialistic system.""The acting is superb, the direction impeccable"" - the direction I think is good, but the acting... The main character... Such play got to be very subtle, therefore it's hard to implement. I DON'T BELIEVE! Far-fetched!"
Kansas-5,"Apr 15, 2007",10/10,"By 1984, East Germany had been gripped for almost four decades in a Stalinist reign of terror. Since 1971, it was headed by Erich Honecker, the builder of the Berlin Wall. The Wall and its architect were toppled almost simultaneously. Wanted for war crimes, unwelcome even in Yeltsin's Russia, Honecker was extradited from Moscow to a now-unified Germany in 1992. Shortly after the onset of his murder trial, for health reasons, he was released to Chile in 1993. At the time, Chile was still protective of aging, bloody former dictators, whether U.S. or Soviet-sponsored. Like Pinochet, he died in disgrace.In ""Lives,"" beginning in 1984, East German secret police (Stasi) inquisitor Hauptmann (Captain) Gerd Wiesler wrestles with a similar dilemma as did Winston Smith in Orwell's ""1984.""Although this film is a gripping exposition of the corruption, dehumanization and immorality of that actual former totalitarian state, in these times of Ashcroft and Gonzales, Bush and Cheney, it should be cautionary to U.S. residents as well.Pay particular attention to the cast of characters in the ""steam room"" during the announcement of the fall, five years after the movie begins.And mind what you say. Big Brother is watching you too."

Just as the character in the opening play had visions of horror, I found myself having horrific visions in thinking that times like that could be on the horizon for the United States if we don't learn from the mistakes of the East Germans and similar socialist regimes. What a timely story!A great movie ... heart wrenching with a beautiful music score, masterfully told, and thoroughly inspiring. It will stay with me for a long time. SEE IT!

benjamin_lappin,"Feb 8, 2010",10/10,"The film writing and directorial debut of Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck ""Das Leben der Anderen"" (The Lives Of Others) is a German drama set in East Berlin in the last years of Communism in the former German Democratic Republic (GDR). Telling the tale of an artistic couple being continually watched, recorded and filmed by members of the ""Stasi"", the East German secret police, as he is suspected of creating subversive plays undermining the state and she is lusted after by a highly ranked official. Successfully nominated for the 2007 Academy Award for ""Best Foreign Film"", ""The Lives Of Others"" is a highly moral and politically charged film that will demand as much emotion and choice from its audience as it does from its protagonists.While the directorial cinematography is lush and crisp, with ""Donnersmarck"" using subtle tones of greys and greens to emphasis the drab, bleak existence in East Germany it is the characterisation within the film that makes this such an engaging and emotional experience. The cast is led superbly by Ulrich Muhe who delivers a stunning performance as ""Hauptmann Gerd Wiesler"" who is charged with leading the investigation into the alleged deviants. He is backed up exceptionally by Martina Gedeck and Sebastian Koch as ""Christa-Maria Sieland"" and ""Geog Dreyman"", respectively, who provide the necessary emotional tension to pull entrap the audience. With all three of these performances, each has to deal with and convey different emotions on their moralistic standpoints, in differing fashions when their whole lives are threatened. Muhe finds himself increasingly involved and engrossed by the drama that is the lives of those he is watching, he finds his unwavering dedication to the Stasi to be brought into question when his reasoning is brought into doubt. Through watching and listening to the idealistic principles of the artistic couple beneath him, doubt slowly creeps into his conscious and he must begin to make a decision as to whether he can continue to justify harming the lives of innocent individuals. Sieland and Dreyman, however, must decide whether they can continue to live their lives as lies, will they sacrifice their artistic freedom to avoid persecution and interference from the state. ""The Lives Of Others"" skillfully leads us down their respective paths as we watch with hope, fear and trepidation at the choices they make.What separates ""The Lives Of Others"" from contemporary dramas of the same styling is the subtlety with which the script has been written and the delivery of those underpinning emotions by the actors. The director builds up immense tension from scenes where very little action is taking place, whether it's Muhe simply listening to a telephone conversation through his headphones or Dreyman hiding a typewriter, Donnersmarck ratchets up the heart rate with such delicate ease. Each of the main protagonists delivers their own unique style of performance to enhance the enclosed feel of the investigation. Gedecks' ""Sielands"" fall from grace is a harrowing and heart breaking affair, as the demure and regal persona falls to reveal a fractured and pained woman, desperately fighting to save her acting career. Koch's ""Dreyman"" is almost the reversal of his female counterpart, starting off as somewhat of a shell, kowtowing to his communist masters yet internally yearning to express himself as he would want. His increased risky disposition is taken under the naive belief that the state have not got him under surveillance which of course leaves everything in the confused hands of Wiesler. From cold, hard calculating man who claims ""the best way to establish guilt...is non-stop interrogation"" to having to question himself as a human being, Wiesler's journey is the keystone which holds the rest in place and Muhe's understated motions of raising an eyebrow here to pursing his lips tell so many stories of his internal strife and is an absolute joy to behold.""The Lives Of Others"" is an exceptional film that is not merely worthy of 2007's ""Best Foreign Film"" Academy Award but of claims that it is perhaps not simply the greatest film of that year, but of the decade as a whole. It in itself is an absolute joke that this and ""Pan's Labyrinth"" weren't in the ""Best Picture"" category regardless of their origins, because the skill with which the director and his cast weave their intricate web and have you riveted as an audience, is an art form to never grow tired of. Donnersmarck's debut is a thoroughly engaging affair that highlights not just European cinema, but cinema as a whole. It is a life affirming experience that will warm your heart and bring a tear to your eye, it will have you utterly entranced for its duration and will leave a mark on your character. The tale of others' lives, their strife, their desires, their wants and their dreams is an experience that will greatly affect yours."
shu-fen,"Sep 13, 2007",N/A,"I just feel a little tired of the flicks telling me that there were good and kind Germans during the cruel times: The Pianist, Sophie Scholl, Rosenstrasse or even ""The Downfall: Hitler and the End of the Third Reich"". However kind these good-natured people were, the collective evil of the regimes like the Nazi and communist syndicate can never be evened up. Which side was more powerful, destructively speaking? The emotional switches of HGW were not convincing. Picture that: his country is the fascist East Germany and he is at a fairly important position among the secret police. He knows every tricks and is highly skilled, experienced, well-versed in interrogation. How can that happen? Concealing what he has listened to without reporting it? How dare he? On the contrary, the actress's betrayal is true to its utmost in real life, though.Many shared with me that it is a fantastic work. True, fantastic in acting, music and many others... I am not being cynical or skeptical, or maybe I am too old at heart and too worldly-experienced about human beings that I just cannot believe that could happen in former East Germany. No way. Human atrocity onto its own species still prevails. Let's wake up and read the news about Iraq, the many civil wars or genocide in Africa, tension in Middle East... The globe is still rotating and human beings are still killing and persecuting one another.Anyway, danke schön! It's a good movie. But, ""I would like it gift wrapped as it's not for me."" Well, do enjoy it! (Ah, check your house carefully, BIG BROTHER may be listening.)"
braddugg,"Sep 20, 2014",10/10,"You can sacrifice anything but yourself and your love and love filled with guilt is better to be dead.The theme of the movie is complex to construe coz it has many layers, its very humane as a theme and brings very gross realities as a human being. Setup in the 1980's Germany where it was still divided and it was in East Germany about an artist couple, a writer and an actress being watched over by the Stasi, by HGW XX/7 the code name of the Policeman who wil note the records of what the couple does all through. This policeman played by Ulrich Muhe is the protagonist of the film. Now, the whole movie drives with his writings, his listenings and what he makes out of them. Truth is kept alive by this man and that is what he lives for, for truth.Now, few movies have a very engrossing screenplay from first frame and this one has it and deservingly is one of the best films in terms of story and screenplay, the direction is so well done that never for a slightest moment did I feel that something was out of place or it is uncalled for, everything went as per the script which is the true hero. There are no aberrations as such as each character is etched out superbly. You cannot write characters as black and white coz there is a flaw in each and that's what is shown.It's one of the few films that is supremely human and music too has it's own place to bring out humanity, like reference of Lenin's quote on Betthoven's symphony. Watch it to know it, I cannot comprehend in mere words what this film is.One of the superb films in recent times. I make it 5/5."

EUyeshima,"Sep 23, 2007",9/10,"Five long years before the Berlin Wall fell, the Stasi, East Germany's secret police, was at the height of its infiltrative power with one in every fifty citizens cooperating with them in sniffing out any scent of political dissidence. To the Western world, it's a relatively unknown piece of Cold War history, but the Stasi's repressive force permeated all aspects of German society. First-time director and screenwriter Florian Henckel von Donnersmark makes a most auspicious debut with this mesmerizing, epic-length 2006 study of the Stasi's devastating impact on a trio of characters in pre-glasnost East Berlin.The protagonist is Captain Gerd Wiesler, who is initially a rigid, humorless master of relentless, soul-baring interrogation techniques highly prized by the regime. He seems so utterly uncompromising that one would have expected a story to evolve that is closer in spirit to a classic Cold War espionage thriller like John LeCarre's The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. However, von Donnersmark digs deeper into the conflicted psyche of this seemingly Machiavellian character by placing him in a situation where he is constantly monitoring the activities of renowned playwright Georg Dreyman and his lover, actress Christa-Maria Sieland, in their shared apartment.Although Dreyman has shown no signs of defying the current regime, Wiesler is ordered by his old classmate Grubitz, now the head of the Stasi's Culture Department, to put the couple under surveillance. What then evolves as the plot thickens is an unspoken bonding of spirits among Wiesler, Dreyman and Sieland as the inherent contradictions between artistic and political expression become more and more pronounced. Wiesler becomes disillusioned when he realizes that the motivation for monitoring the artistic couple is Minister Hempf's unsavory interest in Sieland. Meanwhile, Dreyman ironically does have his political consciousness raised after his blacklisted playwriting mentor kills himself. What transpires is surprising yet most fitting.The performances are uniformly solid beginning with Ulrich Mühe's implosively searing portrayal of Wiesler. For the most part, it's a subtle turn highlighted by powerfully cathartic moments such as his response to Dreyman's playing of a piece called ""Sonata for a Good Man"". It does beg comparisons to Gene Hackman's Harry Caul in Francis Ford Coppola's classic surveillance thriller, The Conversation. Sebastian Koch and Martina Gedeck are equally riveting as the conflicted Dreyman and the increasingly desperate Sieland, who haltingly faces her own dilemma of betrayal. Adding immeasurably to the fatalistic, Orwellian atmosphere that von Donnersmark creates are Gabriel Yared's evocative music (including the beautiful sonata) and Hagen Bogdanski's burnished cinematography.The one drawback is the 137-minute length, which I found slightly excessive, especially toward the end, for the relatively intimate story being told. The filmmaker provides an informative and often enthusiastic commentary track on the 2007 DVD, though most of the major points are captured in the half-hour featurette, ""Interview with Director Florian Henckel von Donnersmark"". There is also a twenty-minute making-of short which includes interviews with the producers and principal cast, as well as eight deleted scenes."
gelman@attglobal.net,"Dec 7, 2009",10/10,"Set in East Berlin in the mid-1980's -- ""The Life of Others"" in the version shown in the United States -- this film comes closer to bringing Orwell's terrifying satire to life than any other picture I've seen about life behind the Iron Curtain. A free-thinking but cautious playwright, Georg Dreyman (Sebastian Koch), is targeted by the Stasi, the notorious East German secret police, because a powerful minister, Hempf (Thomas Thieme), wants to have the noted actress and Dreyman's live-in girlfriend, Christa-Maria Sieland (Martina Gedeck), available to him sexually whenever he wants. A Stasi officer, Gerd Wiesler, (Ulrich Muhe) is assigned by his superior, Grubitz (Ulrich Tukur), the task of wiring Dreyman's apartment and collecting the necessary incriminating evidence. Interplay between Hempf, Grubitz, and Wiesler displays a menacing hierarchical relationship while Dreyman goes about his business believing he is free of suspicion. Meanwhile, Ms. Sieland is under direct pressure from oily Minister Hempf to surrender her body as the price of being allowed to perform her craft. Wiesler's growing sympathy for Ms. Sieland and for Dreyman seems highly improbable and the outcome is melodramatic -- but it is a movie, after all, and improbabilities and melodrama are coin of the realm. The writer and director, Florian Henckel von Donnenmarck, deserves all the honors he won for this film, including a best foreign film Oscar"
mccorry2008,"Aug 26, 2015",9/10,"simply a great movie. It's a little too slow paced especially in the opening 30 minutes which i deducted a point for, but overall a great depiction of the invasive nature of East Germany in the mid 80's, great acting particularly from Muhe and Koch. The story was depicted in a very cold and realistic manner and while this was a movie about serious issues there was also some dark humour provided in the right moments. This has to be one of the most under marketed and underrated movies around, certainly up there with the very best of the decade.In conclusion a great insight into a dark world including the corruption and lack of privacy in a Police state and how it affects the average citizen."

Will they be as good as this ? Can they ? If you're reading this , pondering whether to watch because it's not in your language,take the plunge, you can read can't you ?

behnamboogi,"Aug 29, 2025",3/10,"The general form of The Lives of Others can be understood in terms of concepts such as the gaze and the game of glances. This term refers to the exchange of glances that occurs in cinema. In the early 1970s, first French, then English and American film theorists extended psychoanalysis to film in an attempt to explain the viewer-screen relationship, as well as the textual relationships within the film. They sought to explain how cinema operates on an unconscious level by appealing to Freud's ideas and Lacan's mirror stage theory. In effect, they believed that the process of cinema simulates the functions of the unconscious.The viewer sits in a dark room, his desire is to look at the screen and enjoy what he sees visually. At the same time, the viewer is under the illusion that he can take control of that image."
jamesnicolay,"Dec 5, 2007",10/10,"I just finished watching a powerful German film which bagged the Best Foreign Film in the Oscars last year. I rarely use that description for a film: but the powerful aspect of ""The Lives of Others"" is its message of realistic optimism and compassion amidst the corruption and exploitation of human rights during the last few years of the Socialist Germany. If one is familiar with ""Goodbye, Lenin!""'s comic approach on the issue of the fall of the Berlin Wall, he will find the treatment of the story of the characters in ""The Lives of Others"" far more intense and frightening yet endearing as the secret agent in charge of spying on an artist and his lover becomes too involved in the couple's secret lives. Being a very vigilant servant of the System, Wiesler, the agent, knows that his risk of saving the artists who are attacking the GDR whom he has served for almost all his life is akin to throwing everything that matters to him. But why does he dare? The very answer to that is the gem that one can unfold upon getting involved in the lives of these characters.The performances were incredibly harrowing yet as moving as a beautifully composed sonata. This masterpiece from the director Von Donnersmarck probably is the best European film of this decade so far.There is a line at the latter part of the film which caught my attention... which probably is true for any country which underwent a major overhauling of its political system. This is from a character which was once a high officer in the pre-Falling-of-the-Berlin-Wall Germany.""What is there to write about in this New Germany? Nothing to live in, nothing to rebel against...""Literature and Art do thrive on human struggle and strife. Adversities are the heat and pressure which crystallize the diamond within us."
andreaskurniadi,"Jan 6, 2013",10/10,"Bought the title on blu-ray 6 months ago because the movie got great rating and reviews, but just now I have finished watching the movie. And I feel very regret why not watching the movie the first the time I bought it.The movie is really amazing and might touch your heart a little, if not very much. The story about a German secret police officer, Wiesler, who brilliantly played by Ulrich Mühe. He is given a surveillance job by his superior to keep an eye and write a report consisting every single detail of the activities of Dreyman, a very famous stage writer and his beautiful girlfriend, Sieland. The Government of East Germany suspect him (Dreyman) of being pro communist. But in the end, Wiesler found out that he is innocent and feel there is an ugly conspiracy behind this surveillance that involves Dreyman, Sieland, and Minister Hempf.This movie is worth-watching and no doubt that this has won many awards because the script is well written and the direction from Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck, who did a magnificent job in his first feature. You just can not take your eyes away from the beginning until the unexpected ending.The movie is highly recommended!"
kimi_layercake,"Aug 4, 2010",9/10,"""The Lives of Others"" won the ""Academy Award for Best Foreign Language Film"". That's the reason why most (including me) noticed this film and watched it. Having watched it, the only thing that comes into my mind is the sheer brilliance achieved by this movie in every aspect. Starting from the storyline to casting to direction to the ending that will leave you feeling so sympathetic about the people involved in the film.Cast wise, just brilliant. Obviously, any non-German will find no recognizable face. But what a job each of them delivers. The primary cast is so awesome; making everyone takes notice of their immense talent.The entire atmosphere of the film is very sordid, making the overall feel more realistic considering the theme of the movie. The way the story unfolds is so splendidly captured by the Director, that even at a running time of more than 2 hours, one never stop feeling for the characters. The score perfectly pitches to the sordid atmosphere.Overall, it's a must watch film. It's terrible that such movies need Awards and Recognitions before being noticed. This movie deservingly deserves every award. My Verdict: 9/10"
varun_120,"Mar 7, 2013",9/10,"This film is in my favorite five foreign films list. I was not very much familiar with the background of East Germany. I was shocked to see under what enormous pressure a lot of East Germans had to live. In this film, Georg Dreyman is a dramatist and Christa-Maria Sieland is an actress and his girlfriend. As East German politicians were influenced by Russians, it was considered almost criminal to be associated with West German. And, Georg and Christa and their friends are associated with West side. The Minister of Culture becomes interested in Christa, so the secret service agent Wiesler is instructed to observe and sound out the couple.And from here the story becomes complicated. The minister of culture just want to sexually exploit Christa, and on one night he succeeds in doing that, he rapes her. Georg understands that she is being followed by people of Minister. Wiesler, a Secret service agent empathizes with both of them and tries to help them but it is very difficult for Wiesler too, to help them.How, Wiesler sees Georg is a good person and he thinks whatever is done to him is bad. So, he tries to help him. The acting done by everybody is top notch. I have seen Ulrich Mühe before and knew he is a fine actor. Sebastian Koch (Gerog)and Martina Gedeck (Christa)were new to me. I was very impressed with how Sebastian acted. He did a splendid job. And, what can I say about Martina Gedeck, she is drop dead gorgeous even at the age of 45 in this film.But, once again the best performance is delivered by Ulrich Mühe. His expressions are exceptional in this film. I bumped onto this film when I was searching for best films ever made list on IMDb. I'm glad that I had the chance to view this film. I recommend this film to almost everybody irrespective of political knowledge and background of German partition and later their reunification. This is one of those films which are not be missed."

It's a deep film that has you teetering on the edge of suspense, drama, mystery and thrills, as you develop your understanding of the characters and the lives they live. This is the East Germany version of The Conversation, but what's different about this is the historic value and the truth behind the GDR's controversial motives.One of the finest conspiracy films ever made. It's deep in detail, rich in character and beautifully shot. There is enough story for it to carry out its runtime without boredom, whilst there is also enough surprises for you to never be left on a linear story that may become tiresome."

Thus in a way their victories and defeats are more real, more important and more strongly felt.the movie is well filmed, the feeling of East Germany and all the changes it went through is as close as you can get.

Everything, from the original plot, the screenplay, photography, soundtrack and acting, was perfectly conceived and realized. There was no line which I thought was redundant or avoidable.
From the start of the movie, you are directly immersed into the living conditions of the DDR. The way STASI worked makes you realize that there was no thing such as personal space and freedom of thought.
It is then perfectly depicted what it really means being an artist inside this historical context.
I was not bored for one single second during the whole movie, and after having watched it dubbed in Italian, I also tried to watch it in German. Every character was really well portrayed, and the acting was simply superb.
It saddened me to read that Ulrich Mühe died only one year after the movie was released. His interpretation was outstanding, and the last line he pronounces ""Es ist für mich"" is so full of power after everything his character goes through.
I highly recommend not to miss this title!"

Personally I have ambivalent feelings with the opinion of ""Stassiland"" author Anna Funder for whom the point of view of the director is to optimistic and uplifting, ""a superb movie but not very realistic""; the characters portrayed are the same as anyone any where everywhere and anytime; be it (apropiate here or not for some)Nazi German, Ruanda in the mid 90's or Turkey during the 1913; no matter how dark it may seem or different the circumstances, the perpetrators remain the same, they are red-blooded human beings with capacity for both good and for evil as well."
zbalai,"May 12, 2007",10/10,"I think this film is true art. It created a very strong emotional impact in me, partially because I'm personally affected. (you know, I lived in Hungary from 1977 till 1989 as well and we had the same dirt) Its based upon a wonderful story what seems awfully realistic to me. The system shown is not openly barbaric, but behind the curtains it was doing the worst what you can do with people: corrupting them.The film really shows this universe with excellent characters. The main actor, Ulrich Mühe, could be compared to Kevin Spacey. He transfers this investigator/inquisitor to human being at the end, showing such amount of humility that nears true Buddhism ;).I loved this film and I'm looking forward to see such masterpieces from these creators!"
