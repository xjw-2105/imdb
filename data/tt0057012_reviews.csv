TheLittleSongbird,"Feb 24, 2009",9/10,"I didn't quite understand all of the jokes, but I enjoyed this movie enormously. It is essentially one of the best satirical comedies out there. Peter Sellers was hilarious here in no less than 3 roles. My personal favourite was the president. My favourite line of the film is actually in the title of this review, as Dad and I watched this at midnight and couldn't stop laughing. I loved Sellers also as the man in the wheelchair Strangelove, who tries to impersonate Hitler, I think. There was a brilliant performance from fine actor George C. Scott, who I really admire. I personally think there isn't enough of these two stars on television, I really don't. I noticed a young James Earl Jones too, and the camera-work and direction were both excellent. Got to love the music, I did, a bit ironic, but that was the intention. Great movie! 9/10. Bethany Cox"
bkoganbing,"Apr 6, 2008",9/10,"As a film Dr. Strangelove was so well received that a more serious film on the same topic, Failsafe, failed to find an audience. Yet Strangelove made you think as well as entertain which is the ultimate object of any great work of cinema.General Jack D. Ripper has sent out the Strategic Air Command bombers and locked down Burpelson Air Force Base so that higher ups can't interfere. He's struck back at the dirty Communists for pushing fluoridation of the water supply which he feels has interfered with his bodily functions.Ripper might want to have checked with the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Buck Turgidson who when we meet him seems to have all his bodily functions working just fine. A second opinion on Ripper's lack of bodily functions might have revised his reason on why his particular functions weren't doing well.Of course his actions have created a crisis and President Muffley of the United States is busy trying to talk to Premier Kissoff of the USSR to prevent a nuclear war. That is in case those SAC bombers can't be recalled. One of the bombers commanded by Major Kong is anxious to do battle with the 'Rooskies'.Director Stanley Kubrick went poaching on the black comedy normally that would be the province of Billy Wilder. But even Wilder in his wildest dreams never used those wonderful Dickensian names for his characters that Kubrick is so delighting in. My favorite however is the part played by Keenan Wynn as the army colonel commanding the tactical force that liberates Burpelson, Colonel Bat Guano.Jack D. Ripper is played by Sterling Hayden a man consumed by his lack of bodily functions. This is a takeoff on Army General Edwin Walker who commanded US troops in Germany and was relieved when it was discovered he was indoctrinating his troops with John Birch Society propaganda which included their fears about fluoridation of water. Curiously enough that cause was actually taken up by other than fanatic right-wingers, people like Ralph Nader. Could Ripper have been right after all?George C. Scott is cigar chomping, bodily functioning spoof of legendary SAC commander Curtis LeMay. He's having quite the difficult time in deciding just who to root for in this crisis.Peter Sellers got an Oscar nomination for playing three different characters in Dr. Strangelove. Sellers is President Muttley, Colonel Mandrake of the RAF an exchange officer serving under Sterling Hayden and the crazed former Nazi nuclear scientist Dr. Strangelove. Watching the film, it's almost hard to believe this is the same man using three different voices and appearances that makeup alone could not explain. Sellers lost to his fellow British player Rex Harrison for My Fair Lady.In fact Dr. Strangelove also lost as Best Picture to My Fair Lady. Of course George Bernard Shaw never put his legendary wit to the issue of mutual nuclear annihilation. Neither did Billy Wilder, but I have a feeling those two talents together couldn't have done any better than Stanley Kubrick.The image that stays in your mind from the film I guarantee will be Slim Pickens as Major Kong riding that hydrogen bomb down to its 'Rooskie' target like a bucking bronco.Hopefully we won't meet Major Kong again, who knows where and who knows when."
bertrambuchert,"Jul 18, 2020",9/10,"This movie had humor to an intelligent extent and was one of the most entertaining ""older"" movies. The story was told nice with cuts from the war room, mandrakes story, and the flight. A very linear composition but filled with humor and action. I still love the iconic scene where ""yee haw"" is being screamed while riding nuclear weapon. ICONIC!"
gogoschka-1,"Dec 26, 2013",10/10,"I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat over-constructed and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr.Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century. 10 out of 10.Favorite films: http://www.IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-known Masterpieces: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls070242495/Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls054808375/Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: http://www.imdb.com/list/ls075552387/"
francozeff,"May 17, 2017",10/10,"Spectacular and chilling to watch Dr. Strangelove in May 16, 2017. I'm not going to talk about prophecy not even coincidence. Art has a way to warn, express or simply entertain in a way that its relevance will always be renewed. That opening with George C Scott's secretary, in her underwear, answering the phone for her boss in the most professional tone imaginable, is a masterful way to introduce us to the normal absurdity we're about to embark on. Terry Southern's extraordinary script (sharing credit with Peter George and Stanley Kubrick himself) is a masterpiece of intention and execution. The film doesn't have a moment of emptiness nor a single cheap shot. Everything works with the irrational logic of tradition and set standards. How can something so serious and ultimately terrifying can be so funny. I think that's the definition of film art. I don't want to sound pompous but that's exactly how I feel. I've seen a 1966 movie by Stanley Kubrick in 2017 that's better, more relevant, ingenious and even revolutionary than anything we've seen in a long, long time. Peter Sellers, fantastic three times over (and he was also going to play the Slim Pickens part) George C Scott in one of the greatest comic performances ever put on film and Sterling Hayden in a frighteningly credible show of abuse of power, complete the pleasures of this remarkable film."
Sickfrog,"Aug 14, 1998",10/10,"What makes this film so powerful is the message that it made at the time of its release. This film came out at a height of paranoia of the nuclear age and the Cold War, right around the time of the Cuban Missile Crisis. This film depicts a horrible, tragic incident in which a breach in the government and a few diplomatic mistakes result in nuclear holocaust. So, why didn't this film inspire panic? Because of the brilliant way in which Kubrick presents it... as a satire. The scariest thing about this film in retrospect is not how it depicts the impending doom of the Cold War, but how it makes you laugh at it. By presenting it with humor, it conveys just how much of a farce the nuclear arms race was in real life. And I don't think that any other film has captured the absurdity of war nearly as well as this one has. And I am not likely to believe that one ever will. In my opinion, Kubrick has never made a better film since. And kudos to George C. Scott for his astounding performance, as well as Peter Sellers for the most versatile acting I've seen from an actor in one film, and to Sterling Hayden, for performing the most serious, yet the most hilarious role in film with perfect accuracy. Beware of fluoridation!"
GonzoHans,"Mar 3, 2021",10/10,"The insane acting talent displayed by Peter Sellers isn't the only thing this film did for me. It created a sense of pure panic while simultaneously finding humor in this early piece of brilliance from Kubrick in his long directing career. George C. Scott also turned in a fantastic performance as a typical war hungry 1950's/60's military general. This film will transport you into the middle of a Cold War era. A period where despite the warning label in the beginning explaining its fictional origin, it definitely possessed real possibilities. The whole cast does a absolutely brilliant job and I am a firm believer that this will remain timelessly enjoyable."
WriConsult,"Jun 7, 2002",10/10,"One of the funniest and yet most poignant movies I have ever seen. Kubrick is at his best here, as usual showing what can happen when a finely tuned system built by humans (in this case, the tremendous infrastructure of Mutually Assured Destruction) just doesn't work.  As usual, Kubrick's point is that the system is only as good as the people running it, and here the people running it are hilariously bad.  Career-peak performances by George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, and of course Peter Sellers, Peter Sellers and Peter Sellers.Despite many of this movie's hilarious moments having entered general popular culture, when you watch it they are still funny enough to make you laugh out loud.  And there are yet many more comic gems to delight the unfamiliar viewer.  I've seen Strangelove twice in theaters in the last couple of years ... I was stunned to find packed audiences screaming with laughter and delighted to learn that I'm not the only one who finds it hilarious, even decades after filming."
tellymustard,"Jan 21, 2022",N/A,"Doctor Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is truly a masterpiece. It manages to be a hilarious comedy while still being a film with very serious themes. It is just the perfect balance, and it is truly overall a flawless film."
cartesianthought,"May 16, 2016",6/10,"Yeah. It was funny. It was entertaining. It's not a bad movie by any means. I think Kubrick did a great job with the visuals and the settings.Beyond that, it's not very dramatic or suspenseful. There's not much depth or intellect. I laughed modestly a few times, but mostly, the humor consists of lazy military stereotypes. The premise was interesting. I could've done with less cockpit and gun firing scenes. Perhaps the general and his descent into madness could've used more fleshing out. I don't know. It feels like it's missing something.Maybe it's one of these meme movies like Napoleon Dynamite that you either ""get"" or you don't."
archyon,"Oct 14, 2000",10/10,"This movie is possibly the best comedy ever made, only with one fact against it: it's not very ""comical"". Hilarious? Yes. Comical? Absolutely not. The horrors of the nuclear war caused by a simple mistake materialize before us, directed with skill by the late maestro, Kubrick.There are simply not enough words to describe Peter Sellers's BRILLIANT performance in three roles: A british officer, the U.S president and Dr. Strangelove. He is hilarious as the british officer, with his wonderful accent, gloomy and neurotic as the president and simply insane as Dr. Strangelove.Also note that this movie includes a performance by very young James Earl Jones, who we now all know as the voice behind Darth Vader.The ending scene is also a masterpiece."
jimbo-53-186511,"May 8, 2015",5/10,"Dr Strangelove is a film that is sitting high up in the IMDb Top 250 films (it's currently sitting at number 49 on the list) and therefore it's clearly a film that is generally loved by the public - the critics also have a strong liking for this film. I personally found this film a little uneven if I'm honest....I think where this film is at its strongest is once we get to The War Room; the scenes within the War Room are easily the funniest and best examples of satire. The phone calls between the US President and the Russian President did have me really laughing and I also liked the interplay between President Muffley and the militant Buck Turgidson and thought their various exchanges were absolute gold. Peter Sellers was fantastic in his three different roles although I must admit he was definitely at his best as the German Weapons Researcher. Sellers clearly had a lot of fun here and his performance(s) in this film do almost make up for some of the more tedious aspects. Likewise, Scott was great in his respective role and Hayden was good as the insane general and gave a real scenery chewing performance - did that cigar ever leave his mouth? I think the funniest part of the film was the scene where Mandrake is trying to get through to the President, but runs out of money and asks a soldier to shoot the Coca Cola machine so that he can get some more money in order to get through to the President. The soldier then utters the line ""If you don't get through to the President, you'll end up in trouble with Coca-Cola"". A very funny exchange and quite unexpected if I'm honest.Where the film falters slightly is in most of the scenes outside the War Room. There were far too many scenes from within the war planes that were quite dull if I'm honest. I can understand the opening plane scene and the closing plane scenes, but the constant cuts from the War Room to the planes just seemed pointless. If there was any humour to be found in the 'plane' scenes then it was clearly lost on me. Unfortunately these dull scenes did drag the film down slightly for me despite the fact that the majority of The War Room scenes were very funny.Dr Strangelove isn't a bad film, but it's a very uneven film that was both very funny and very tedious. Unfortunately the good and the bad pretty much cancel each other out hence the score of 5 out of 10."
Ignorant Bastard,"Jun 26, 2001",N/A,"Stanley Kubrick's first and only comedic masterpiece is still the finest ever made. I love everything in the movie: the brilliant acting, sensational script, flawless direction, and even those quirky visual effects. Not only was this film hilarious, it was a breakthrough for the entire film industry when first released. In addition to it's amazing satirical basis, the film also played a major role in how films were advertised and marketed... as if Peter Seller's performance wasn't enough! The sets were also very convincing and just plain great! So realistic in fact, that the FBI almost investigated how they got the B-52 Bomber replicated to near perfection!In the end, 'Dr. Strangelove: or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is the best comedy. It's also another milestone in film making and another reason to be astonished when looking at the work of Stanley Kubrick.An obvious perfect ***** / *****"
justusmcqueen,"Feb 16, 2001",10/10,"Few films are able to take a deadly serious issue and place it within the context of a broad comedy successfully.  Dr. Strangelove does exactly that. Kubrick's masterpiece illustrates in brilliant fashion the idiocy of nuclear war and the idiots who are orchestrating it. What strikes one most however in this cinematic gem are the individual characterisations of Sellers, Scott, Hayden and Pickens. To refer to them as memorable roles is a gross understatement. With names such as President Merkin Muffley, General ""Buck"" Turgidson, General Jack D. Ripper and Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, you know that these characters will not be soon forgotten. Other features of the film such as the remarkably designed ""war room"" set, the hand-held camera techniques employed by Kubrick and the black and white cinematography of Gilbert Taylor only add to the power and impact of ""Strangelove.""  Quite simply, the greatest American film by the greatest American director."
TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Dec 22, 2004",10/10,"Who'd have thought that Kubrick had such a great sense of humor? I mean, in most of his films, there are snippets of humor, and Barry Lyndon has a definite irony, but I hadn't expected him to be able to direct such a hilarious and thoroughly entertaining comedy. I had known for a while that this was the highest rated Kubrick film here on IMDb, so naturally, I was excited to find out if it was really his best film. Even though I haven't seen Lolita, Spartacus, Eyes Wide Shut or his first few films(the shorts he made before his feature), and even though I thoroughly enjoyed his other films, this very well may be his best film. Made in a period of time where the thought of nuclear war was a terrifying idea, that was believed to be a reasonable fear, the film takes this idea and turns it around, makes us laugh at it. The film was made during the Cold War, which must have taken quite a lot of guts on Kubrick's side... then again, he did start out, intending to make a thriller/suspense film about the subject, but ultimately realized that a comedy with a lighthearted look on the situation would be a better idea. So, he turned the idea of impending doom from nuclear holocaust into a black comedy. Personally, I think he did a damn good job of it. I haven't laughed that hard and for so long at any one time for quite a while... in fact, I might never have. The comedy isn't overplayed, in fact most of it is presented in a dead-pan, matter-of-fact-like type of way... what's even more hilarious is that the better part of it is completely accurate. No dumb stereotypes, no old clichés... just logic and simple, good old-fashioned observation. The plot is excellent, and very well-paced. In my opinion, Kubrick's most well-paced film. The plot takes off almost immediately and moves at a great pace throughout the film. The acting is flawless. Absolutely flawless. Not something completely unusual for a Kubrick film, but still. George C. Scott and Peter Sellers are amazing. Normally, I'm not too fond of Sellers, but here he was brilliant. The characters are well-written, diverse and interesting. The cinematography is great. Just like Kubrick's other films, this one has some very memorable scenes, one of which(the bomb-riding sequence) has been referenced and spoofed a huge number of times... possibly more times than any other sequence in Kubrick's films, which is quite impressive. The dialog is well-written, well-delivered and memorable. Plenty of quotable lines. I can't really say much more about the movie without ruining one or more of the innumerable great jokes... so I'll just suggest you see it. Seriously, if you enjoy Kubrick's sense of humor as seen limited in his other movies, you're going to enjoy this film. Maybe not as much as I did, but you'll most likely laugh. A lot. I recommend this to any fan of Kubrick, black comedies, Peter Sellers or just comedies with a dark basic theme to watch this. I can't praise it enough. See it, unless you are offended by the themes the film presents. You won't regret it. I know I didn't. Not by a long shot. Hilarious film with a provocative plot and basic idea. 10/10"
RufusT,"Jan 19, 1999",10/10,"One of the best films ever made, this remains timeless despite changes in technology, foreign policy and world politics; the military/political madness remains the same.  Gets better all the time, with successive viewings and its luster has not dimmed since its first release.With three show-stopping performances from Sellers (amongst his best work, if not THE BEST), and an unexpectedly hilarious turn by George C. Scott (if Sellers weren't SO dead on-target, Scott would easily steal the show), STRANGELOVE is filled with cartoonish, over-the-top characters that, despite the lunacy, still ring true.  Special mention must be made for Sterling Heyden's controlled, brooding paranoia as General Jack D. Ripper.  He's funny, he's scary.All-in-all, a brilliant piece of work by all involved."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Sep 17, 2023",7/10,"A somewhat unhinged US General goes rogue, and orders a bombing raid on The Soviet Union. His actions send The War Room into a panic, various personalities clash, as they try to avoid a nuclear holocaust.I have really enjoyed reading the reviews, especially the numerous 10 star reviews, it's clear that this film is loved my many, personally I enjoyed it, I'd say it's a very good film, I'm not sure I see it as a great.When it comes to Kubrick I still think 2001 is my favourite, followed by Clockwork Orange.The acting is phenomenal, Peter Sellers gives one of his best (and let's be honest there are many) ever performances, he is phenomenal, each character he plays is so different.I enjoyed the cleverness of it, it's very sharp and witty, I thought some of the laughs were a little flat, and at times it was just a little too clever for its own good.I loved the visuals, it looks so sharp and polished, the black and white fits the story incredibly well.How gloriously unexpected that moment where Dame Vera Lynn comes blasting out with we'll meet again.Sellers is a joy to watch.7/10."
IamTaylor04,"Mar 30, 2025",10/10,"I have a complicated relationship with Stanley Kubrick. However, I have nothing but praise for Dr Strangelove.I have scarcely seen such a cleverly written comedy film, mainly because many attempts try to be too clever and appear pretentious or unfunny. Thankfully, I can absolutely say the opposite of Dr Strangelove. It is a wonderfully written satire of the Cold War and highlights how ridiculous war is when you break it all down.His brilliant sense of humour is one crucial aspect lacking in all other Kubrick films. Fortunately, you will find it in abundance in this film. If Dr Strangelove is Kubrick's vision for the comedy genre, I must say it's unfortunate that he didn't visit it often.This is a hilarious anti-war film worth your time and my favourite of Kubrick's works. Enjoy."
josephrygaard,"Sep 9, 2019",6/10,"""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) is an iconic satire about the consequences of nuclear war and arms race. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:It is important to remember that Dr. Strangelove is a movie from 1964 and was thereby released soon after the culmination of the Cuba Crisis two years earlier. At its face value, it is a slow-burning feature filled with a unique, dark and time-stamped humor when all things are considered. Expect a lot of dialogue with over-the-top patriotism and prejudice against communists, with a few scenes and conversations sprinkled with a hint of sexuality.Going deeper into the movie however, this was a very real threat that was closer to explode than what most people think, and it that light, Dr. Strangelove is... quite something. Some will find it tedious with clumsy special effects, and other will find it an intriguing reflection of a tense era, capsulated in an hour and a half.My personal grade: a peculiar 6/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."
comradechairmanobama,"Feb 26, 2025",10/10,"Certainly one of the best films ever made, and certainly the best satire ever made. The entire cast of heavy-hitting Hollywood greats is in top form. The satire; the irony; the amazing acting; the story; the sheer comic genius; Stanley Kubrick's masterful directing: it's all there. Give it a whirl, and you'll find yourself coming back to this gem again and again. From Sterling Hayden's bat-crap crazy General Jack Ripper, to George C. Scott's General 'Buck' Turgidson, to Peter Sellers' President Merkin Muffley/Group Captain Lionel Mandrake/Dr. Strangelove, and, of course, Slim Pickens as Major Kong, the performances are just incredible. There's a reason this has remained my favorite movie for over thirty years."
Quinoa1984,"Feb 13, 2000",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick always likes to try something new with each movie he does, and this proves it. This is truly one of the grittiest, and best dark comedies I've ever seen with some crude moments and some odd ones (who'd think to have Slim Pickens riding a bomb on it's way down). It turns into a flat out masterpiece though with the spectacular acting by Peter Sellers (in three separate roles), George C. Scott (his facial expressions are a crack up every time), and a supporting cast of crazies in a government of loons, the most impressive of these being the incomparable Sterling Hayden in his best dramatic/funny role. It contains a resonance as well that sticks till today, as corruption and pig-headedness rules in all sorts of governments, but most of all in those with the most power. It's almost worth it just for the opening credits and end sequence with ""we'll meet again""."
reaper1800,"Feb 11, 2003",10/10,"Entertainment Weekly called this one of the funniest 100 movies ever made. It also happens to be one of the most disturbing movies made. The humor is right there in your face, however, there is always an underlining political critique under every character, every line, and every government representation. Slim Pickins is the never quit Airman. He is a representative of our entire military system of the time. The president, played beautifully by Peter Sellers, is a demure, calm presence trying to deal with the Russian premiere. His perfect counterpart is a war hungry General, ready to accuse the Russians of any small infraction. This leads to one of the funniest lines in the whole movie. Sellers also plays a British airman who has to deal with the crazed general in the usual polite British manner. Seller's third role is that of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, a former nazi and weapons designer for the Americans. He represents the scientific community of that time period; those who worked tirelessly to build a better bomb. These characters, all of them strongly parodying a cross section of society make for an odd story. The final scene, while played for laughs, is actually a frightening image of a communist future. The final moments are frightening in their truth leading one to put themselves in a position of the characters. Dr. Strangelove is the funniest disturbing film I've ever seen."
smatysia,"Mar 12, 2002",9/10,"This film must have really stuck in a lot of craws when it came out. Kubrick's black comedy of the Cold War (right in the middle of it) is notable for a number of reasons. In many ways the film seems to make light of the menace posed by Communism, when later events proved that that menace was utterly real and extremely dangerous. There were tremendous acting performances by George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. It was interesting to see Sterling Hayden working with Kubrick again, some years after ""The Killing"". Some parts of the film dragged a little bit, and some were, of course, way over the top. A complete classic, though. And isn't it interesting how Seller's Strangelove was eerily evocative of Kissinger, years before he was widely known. Grade: A+"
Coventry,"Jun 5, 2003",10/10,"Who else than Stanley Kubrick could take a serious subject like the cold war and tell the story like a comedy ??? He proves his genius in this film more like in any other film of his. It's the story about one general ( with the very appropriate name Jack D. Ripper) gone mad and he launches an attack on Russia all by himself. He's mad, but still smart enough to prevent that anyone can stop him. He's got this strange ( but very funny ) theories about body-fluids, but his men respect him and do everything he says. So 34 fully-armed plains are sent to as many targets. Meanwhile his Colonel, Mandrake, tries to talk sense to him and the president and another General are trying to warn the Russian prime minister. You can have nothing but great respect for Peter Sellers. He plays three roles in this film and every single one of them is flawless. The doctor Strangelove character is hilarious and creepy at the same time. His appearances as the doctor are, along with the telephone conversations between the president and the Russian Prime minister the funniest moments in the film... Also the classic bomb-ride of Major Kong off course. George C. Scott is clearly having fun in his role and the debut of James Earl Jones is also definitely worth mentioning. Like I said already...a must see film if you're a film lover in general."
martinvonmartian,"Jul 4, 2021",10/10,"It's slow, old, boring and not exciting.That is what most people who dont watch a lot of movies probably think.You dont watch this unless you love movies, you definitely dont watch this with a date or casual friends.A movie for movie lovers full of humor and exaggerated characters.Watch it, you won't regret it."
billso,"Nov 30, 2003",6/10,"I can only shake my head at some of the fawning film-school comments here. Yes, Sellers' performances are brilliant, you'll laugh out loud at his Dr. Strangelove, and the rest of the cast is excellent. Yes, it was an especially daring satire for its time, making light of a subject that was deadly serious in 1964.  And yes, you'll enjoy the Kubrickian touches and details - the contemplative camera, the ""cold"" lighting, the political sarcasm, the signature ""head bent, eyes up"" expression from George C. Scott which we later saw in Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket et al; and the final scene set to intentionally light and inappropriate music, a precursor to the evocative use of ""Blue Danube Waltz"" in ""2001"".  For all these reasons, see Dr. Strangelove.But the whole is less than the sum of its excellent parts. It's simply not a great movie. The set pieces in the war room and Keenan Wynne's office drone on and on towards modest punchlines, the B-52 scenes are interesting mostly to electricians, the attack on the military base resolves awkwardly, and the movie's climax is clumsy at best (and yes, I ""get"" the intent of the final cut away from the warroom). The movie as a whole hangs together poorly.Although not a great film, its an important film, especially for its time. See it, but temper your expectations."
thechildrenscrusade,"Dec 29, 2004",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick once again, dazzles and amazes. Dr. Strangelove is simply revolutionary, witty, entertaining, funny as heck, and of course, with a powerful message underlying it all. Kubrick felt that so many of the absurdities of nuclear war (etc.) had to be left out in order to make the film a serious piece, but he also felt that they were necessary in order to get the full message across, so he decided to make the film a satire, unlike the book, which it is based off of. The result of this, is nothing short of extraordinary!Each character's name has sexual connotations and such. If one delves deeply enough into the matter, and begins to take notice, the entire film has a sexual underlining. From the first scene of the aerial ""re-fueling"" to the matter of ""precious bodily fluids"" with General Ripper to the ending idea of the underground society, primarily made up of men - sex is all around! Also at the center of the film is the idea of ""mutual assured destruction"" and the ""doomsday device"" - there is so much hidden between the layers of this film - its impossible to do it justice in a short comment.I urge everyone to take notice of every aspect of this film, from the differing camera shots and angles, to the dark humor, and of course, the message that lies underneath it all. For, in a Kubrick, only if one does this, can one achieve the full affect! =) Peter Sellers does an amazing job in his three roles. The immortal line ""You can't fight in here, this is the war room!"" shall live on forever in every film buff's mind. And of course, Dr. Strangelove being hardly able to maintain his hail Hitler arm - simply fabulous and extremely funny.The only fault might be in the fact that Kubrick cut out a final pie throwing scene which would tie up some loose ends (i.e. the Russian taking a secret picture of the large map on the screen) but Kubrick didn't like the final outcome, so he cut it from the movie. Still, this is movie magic and film at its best! Stanley Kubrick, master auteur, does it again."
KaseGauner,"May 26, 2005",10/10,"This film is absolutely brilliant. It's one of my favorites.Kubrick is the master of satire. He turns something as serious as the threat of global thermonuclear war and turns it into one nonstop two hour joke.The dialog is excellent. The story, cast and direction is amazing. Peter Sellers is at his best in this film.General Ripper's Fluoridation monologue is hysterical.They really do a fantastic job of showing the stupidity of the cold war.10 out of 10!Best film of the decade"
sudhirkumarpal8,"Aug 9, 2020",8/10,"What art of movie making can do, is visible in this movie. Even a serious topic as war can be satirized if the skills are perfect. That's what the perfection does, anything as perfect as the edge of a sword. Peter playing three different roles, and I had no clue of this untill I read an article about this. I took me hours to get fully convinced about the oneness of him in those all three roles. I would say the make up was to its perfection. The movie even being monochrome was more colourful and entertaining than the modern CGI mess."
rmax304823,"Jun 9, 2002",9/10,"The best black comedy ever made. I could watch it a thousand times and still laugh. Oh -- dated, sure. There no longer is a Soviet Union, although there are plenty of people willing to barbecue one another nuclearly -- as in India and Pakistan. I'd like to mention the writer on this, the late Terry Southern, who had lots of input into some pretty funny movies, not to mention his short stories or novellas. He's the guy who came up with ""pre-version."" Kubrik did a fine job. He lost his sense of humor afterward.The acting couldn't be better. George C. Scott embeds himself in one's brain as the general. And Peter Sellers. ""Look, Mein Fuhrer -- I can VALK!"" They wanted him to play King Kong, the pilot, but it didn't work out. Doesn't matter. It's hard to imagine how he would have improved upon Slim Pickens. ""Two pairs a nylon stockin's. Two pair a prophylactics. Shoot. A fella could have a good time on this in Vegas."" Sterling Hayden as the mad general gives his best performance ever, even managing to inject a note of pathos into his delusions. For what it's worth, the final target they attack, ""the missile complex at Laputa"", comes from Swift's satire, ""Gulliver's Travels,"" in which Laputa is the name of a flying island.After the Doomsday Device has gone off and begun to irradiate the entire globe, Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove, opines that it might be possible for selected humans to survive in the deepest of mine shafts. I wanted to make some reference to a Mine Shaft Gesellschaft but couldn't figure out an easy way to fit it in. So I'm shoe-horning it in here. Not that it makes much difference because so few will twig.The final scenes. Credits roll. Atomic blast follows atomic blast whilst Vera sings ""Keep Smiling."" DO NOT MISS THIS ONE. If you miss it, you will miss something worth seeing."
vinnie-79062,"May 20, 2021",7/10,I just don't find this movie very funny. I chuckled at a handful of lines and scenes. But overall I just did not like it very much. Peter Sellers and the rest of the cast were great but overall the movie is not.Sorry.
imseeg,"Dec 15, 2018",9/10,"Slowburning, satyrical nuclear war comedy about an american general who goes bananas and starts a nuclear attack on his own.The bad:
This movie is dated. And it shows: the special effects give me headaches, because they are so clumsily done. And there are lots of those clumsy effects. But it is a comedy, so who cares? Most of the jokes are completely silly, which sometimes irritates me a bit. But hey, it is a comedy, so who cares if it is completely silly now and then. The speed of this story might be way to slow for some viewers, but acting is really great and hilarious, so that evens things out a lot, for me personally.The good:
Despite all of these minor flaws that are mentioned above, ""Dr Strangelove"" is still an impressive movie about the total madness of nuclear war. However silly this comedy might be, it has got a serious message for all us viewers: a nuclear war will mean the end of all of us. There are no winners, only losers in a nuclear war, however hard some try to convince us folks of the opposite. This movie is about all those people who think that nuclear war can be good IF we strike first. Because IF WE DON'T have nuclear powers, THEY will have them. These twisted paranoid ideas could mean the end of the world as we know it and director Stanley Kubrick made a great classic comedy about it.When watching this classic movie, one must not forget that the director made this movie in an era in which the americans came close to nuclear war with the russians during the ""bay of pigs"" conflict in Cuba during the sixties. However silly this movie might be, it has got a very serious message about the dangers of nuclear power. THAT particular message is what makes ""Dr. Strangelove"" a timeless classic."
ma-cortes,"Jan 30, 2014",7/10,"Classic black anti-war comedy with magnificent acting by all-star-cast , lavish production design by Ken Adam and masterfully realized by the always original Stanley Kubrick . It deals with an insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden was patterned after Gen. Thomas S. Power, LeMay's protégé and successor as Chief of the Strategic Air Command) triggers a path to nuclear holocaust that a war room full of politicians and generals frantically try to stop . There intervenes a motley group of offbeat characters such as a scientist (Peter Sellers was paid $1 million, 55% of the film's budget ,Stanley Kubrick famously quipped ""I got three for the price of six"") whose artificial arm repeatedly makes Heil Hitler sign as an involuntary reflex action , a hawkish general named Buck Turgidson (gunchewing militarist excellently performed by Geoge C Scott , this character was patterned after the Chief of Staff of the Air Force, Gen. Curtis LeMay, who was renowned for his extreme anti-Communist views) and the US President Merklin Muffley (inimitable Peter Sellers , this role was patterned after Adlai Stevenson II, who lost two presidential elections to Dwight D. Eisenhower )to deal with consequences a nuclear attack .This splendid film contains unforgettable scenes such as a soft drinking vending machine dispute , sketches involving a phone call to the American President and the movie's funniest the notorious Slim Pickens's wild ride on the bomb . Based on the novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George, and originally conceived as a tense thriller about the possibility of accidental nuclear war. Stanley Kubrick was working on the script when he realized that many scenes he had written were actually quite funny , he then brought in Terry Southern to turn the story into a satire . This was the final collaboration between controversial Stanley Kubrick and his producing partner James B. Harris , as he left to begin his own directing career. Harris was involved in the early development stage of this production. It was during this stage that, according to Harris, Kubrick began to toy with the idea of turning it into a comedy .Very good acting by Sterling Hayden as a crazed general initiating a nuclear attack on the Soviets and George C. Scott was reputedly annoyed that Stanley Kubrick was pushing him to overact for his role , while he vowed never to work with Kubrick again, Scott eventually saw this as one of his favorite performances and many fans consider it some of his best work on-screen . And of course, the great Peter Sellers who plays a tour-de-force triple role , as he improvised most of his lines . Sellers plays Dr. Strangelove , a wheelchair-bound adviser who apparently suffers from agonistic apraxia, also known as ""alien hand syndrome¨ , an useless President and General Ripper's assistant . As Columbia Pictures agreed to provide financing only if Peter Sellers played at least four major roles , in their eyes, Sellers playing multiple roles was one reason Lolita (1962) was so successful. Peter Sellers was the first actor to be nominated for a single Academy award , best actor , for a film in which he portrayed three different characters in the same film . Furthermore , an awesome support cast with triumphant acting from Keenan Wynn as Col. 'Bat' Guano , Slim Pickens as Maj. 'King' Kong , Peter Bull as Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky , Tracy Reed as Miss Scott and film debut of James Earl Jones.This was apparently one of the first films in which the US Air Force's new B-52 Stratofortress bomber was featured. It appeared in a number of films afterward, notably A Gathering of Eagles (1963), and By Dawn's Early Light (1990) and the first Bombers B 52 (1957) . In fact , in the early 1960s the B-52 was cutting-edge technology. Access to it was a matter of national security , the Pentagon refused to lend any support to the film after they read the script , as set designers reconstructed the B-52 bomber's cockpit from a single photograph that appeared in a British flying magazine. Atmospheric musical score by Laurie Johnson , including some classic songs . Brilliant Cinematography in white and black by Gilbert Taylor , being Stanley Kubrick's last black and white film. . The motion picture was stunningly directed by Stanley Kubrick , as research, he read nearly 50 books about nuclear war . This is probably the most famed picture -with the possibly exception of 2001 A space odyssey- of the relatively infrequent movies directed by this extraordinary filmmaker."
ken_vandenbussche,"Dec 20, 2001",1/10,"Regardless of the many classic films Stanley Kubrick made over the years, he started out his career with a very bad one.  The same goes for James Cameron who, after his debut with a disastrous Piranha-sequel, only made superb films since the year 1984.Even though I respect everybody's opinion regarding this film, I find it very hard to believe that ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a brilliant and hilarious masterpiece.  Personally, I think it's one of the worst films I've ever seen.  And since there wasn't a single joke in this film that amused me, it simply has to be one of the most boring comedies ever made.  The acting was below average, but that's because the film is filled with many tiresome characters.  Peter Sellers, normally a good actor, also fails in saving this picture.I've tried to watch and enjoy this film twice, but in both cases it was too monotonous to finish it.  It would have been so much better if Kubrick had left out those stupid jokes that ruin the movie and make a war-drama instead.  The one and only interesting thing about this film is Kubrick focusing on how it's possible for one man to start a war after going completely insane.  Unfortunately, this quite original idea does not work well in a bizarre comedy such as this one here.  With a slightly better storyline and less boring characters, ""Dr. Strangelove"" truly might have become worth watching.And that explains the very good reason why this is Kubrick's first and only comedy.  He's one of the best directors of all time, but he's not capable of making a decent comedy; so much has been proven here.  Of course you can't blame the man for trying out different kinds of genres.  As far as I know, Stanley Kubrick is one of the most varied film directors of all time."
Prismark10,"Nov 8, 2019",9/10,"'Gentlemen. You can't fight here this is the war room.'Stanley Kubrick is not someone who immediately comes to mind as a director of an absurdist black comedy. Yet he co-wrote and directed Dr Strangelove at a time the cold war was raging in the real world.General Jack D Ripper (Sterling Hayden) who sees a communist plot everywhere has flipped his lid. He has executed a plan that allows him to override the American president and launch a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union.In the war room, the hawkish General Turgidson (George C Scott) sees a tactical advantage on a nuclear first strike against the Soviets. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries to placate the Russian president in a phone call and prevent an all out nuclear war. Although the conversation is always one sided, we never see the Russian president.Colonel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) a British executive officer attached to Ripper tries to stop him but Ripper has gone bat crazy.Finally former Nazi German Dr Strangelove (Peter Sellers) now a scientific advisor to President Muffley has an idea to survive in underground mines and eventually repopulate the planet.It is spooky to think that there are several people like Ripper and Turgidson about serving in various governments around the world. Even Dr Strangelove comes across as real, even with his arm trying to do a Nazi salute. Many ex Nazi scientists were employed by foreign governments after the second world war.It is a grim black comedy about paranoia and it works because everyone is playing it straight. Slim Pickens as Major King Kong was not even aware that this was a comedy.George C Scott plays it broad but still makes Turgidson scary and silly at the same time. He gives a great performance, Sellars gives a better one in three different roles.The film has some great lines, wonderful set design such as the iconic war room and well known scenes such as Pickens sitting on a bomb as it is dropped from a plane."
Ragorn,"Feb 5, 1999",9/10,"The absurdities of war, both to be taken literally and as a metaphor of life, have rarely been more eloquently displayed, in any media. The message is that we can chase invisible Commies and arms gaps all we like, but in the end, annihilation awaits Capitalists and Commies alike. The absurdity of the arms race is shown with amazing clarity twice. First, when the Russian ambassador says that they built the Doomsday device to close the ""Doomsday Gap."" Second, in the end, we are shown that nothing was learned, as nothing is ever learned, and that there is still talk of beating the Russians in the Coal-Shaft-Race. The coal shafts, of course, represent a return to primitive living. We are shown that parinoia is universal, in all societies, in all civilizations. The level of living is irrelevant. I also see a lovely parallel between the Nazis hiding in their bunkers, during the last days of the Third Reich, and of the American Leaders' desire to hide out underground. This is of course emphasized by Dr. Strangelove's compulsions (calling the President ""Mein Füher"" and his uncontrolled right arm). Was the Cheyanne Mountain Complex built/known of when this movie was made? If not, then I see a great deal of irony there. Also, when was the incident when the return codes to the Strategic Air Command were not sent (see my note in the goofs section)? Talk about prophecy, once again, if it was after the movie was produced. Oh, and the link I mentioned (Camus, Beckett, and Kudrick) is that of absurdism. But then again, I see that everywhere:) -Scott"
basilislabr,"Aug 26, 2020",10/10,"Yes this movie is amazing, an absolute must see, especially for the young.But be warned, this movie is NOT a comedy. Its a surealistic approach to historical events that took place, mostly in the 60's.Operation ""chrome dome"" lasted for almost a decade and it had b52's flying 24/7, around the soviet union, armed with thermonuclear bombs, ready for a preemptive strike.
During this operation there are, six confirmed accidental plane crashes, in locations around the globe, in which the crashed nuclear bombs contaminated the environment with radiation. In 1966, one of them took place at the coast of Spain.Also, the madman strategy was later proved to be an actual diplomacy doctrine, conceived by henry kissinger and nixon and actually used by the nixon administration.Lastly, the ""fantastical"" character of dr.strangelove, depicts the nazi scientists that was recruited by americans to help them with their advanced knowledge in weapon technology, such as Von Braun, father of the american missile program.Knowing all this, one can only be disturbed and alerted by this movie and at grasping how close the world came to a nuclear holocaust, due to the madness of a handfull of people. In this point, the sureal elements of the movie set in, to restore some balance and remove some of the bitterness that reality holds."
lachezarmatneshliev,"Feb 27, 2024",9/10,"A masterpiece... The genius of Dr. Strangelove is that it's possible to laugh -- and laugh hard -- while still recognizing the intelligence and insight behind the humor. The film is a model of barely controlled hysteria in which the absurdity of hypermasculine Cold War posturing becomes devastatingly funny--and at the same time nightmarishly frightening in its accuracy. More lethal than a nuclear waste dump, Kubrick's komedy at least kills us with laughter... It's one of the greatest - and undoubtably the most hilarious - antiwar statements ever put to film. Seen after 30 years, Dr. Strangelove seems remarkably fresh and undated - a clear-eyed, irreverant, dangerous satire. And its willingness to follow the situation to its logical conclusion - nuclear annihilation - has a purity that today's lily-livered happy-ending technicians would probably find a way around. Kubrick's comic gem sparkles with enduring relevance. The hard-charging originality of the screenplay the equivalent is Dr. Strangelove Kubrick's best movie? Briliant story's crisis as a means to argue for total annihilation of Russia offers a top performance, one of the best in the film. Yet some of the laughs come too easy and linger too long; for the film's message to have maximum impact, the laughter has to stick in your throat. The ultimate touch of ghoulish humor is when we see the bomb actually going off, dropped on some point in Russia, and a jazzy sound track comes in with a cheerful melodic rendition of ""We'll Meet Again Some Sunny Day."" Somehow, to me, it isn't funny. It is malefic and sick..!?"
hanson_tristan,"Oct 22, 2003",N/A,"Easily Kubrick's best film, this satirical romp is not only funny but poignant. Sellers is perfectly cast (in one of the best acting performances I have seen) in three roles. The supporting cast is good, with Hayden giving a wonderful performance as the psychotic General Ripper. Kubrick is able to illustrate the contradictory nature of the Cold War, and of war in general, by making us laugh at life-threatening, intensely serious situations. The sets are amazing, with the interior of the B-52 and the massive War Room standing out. Overall, arguably the best film I have ever seen.Just remember ""gentleman, you can't fight in here, this is the War Room!"""
A_FORTY_SEVEN,"Oct 27, 2018",6/10,"My Rating : 6/10Led by the always zany Peter Sellers this film takes a satirical look at the cold war and the threat of nuclear war. A general (Sterling Hayden) perceives a false threat from the USSR and sets planes carrying nuclear bombs to attack soviet targets while politicians as well as high ranking military men try to stop it from escalating. With a supporting cast coming from a lot of fantastic actors, most memorably from George C. Scott, this film will keep you laughing from beginning to end while looking at the absurdity of those who are in charge of the worlds fate. There may not be fighting in the war room, but there are laughs aplenty."
alehaf-38127,"Jan 6, 2024",9/10,"Stanley Kubrick's 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' tells us a lot about the state of our world and who is controlling it and who has the power.This film is about the turning of a US generals mental state, practically becoming a sociopath and ordering 35 planes to drop bombs onto the Soviet Union causing a detonation of the doomsday device causing the world to end and it is the US governments job to prevent this as well as the Soviet Union.This film is about corruption, power, control, the state of our world, and its fragility and sensibility. Just like that could we be put in a situation like this. The current president of the United States is no more of an intellectual than the US general who ordered these bombs to the Soviet Union which says a lot about what we are doing with ourselves today, and take note that this film came out in 1964.Stanley Kubrick is a master at his work and for him to be topped is something I don't see being achieved ever. Whilst I do want to praise him for this movie, there wasn't a lot in the film to work with for it to be noticed and praised about. If we're being honest here, the majority of this film is about people sitting down and talking and though it is possible to make such a scenario interesting, this did not really stand out to me. But for what this movie was and what Kubrick had to work with from his own screenplay, I love it, I love the concept, I love the ending, and so I don't take anything away from it.The screenplay, in my opinion, is very impressive. The overall concept of the film is so brilliant to me and what it means really resonates with the way the world has been working since the modern ages. The characters are unique, they contribute and each have their own traits. The progression, development, and following of this film also stands out to me as we go back and forth to where the problem originated to the doers of the problem, which is just one example of what I am talking about. Also the ending is so incredibly brilliant to me. For me, when it comes to endings with music that don't make entire sense and just have a bunch of random clips is incredible to me (Babylon) and I feel like this had the same or similar effect.The cinematography isn't overly impressive. But for what they were working with the script, it was as good as it could get and I believe it truly enraptured each and every moment to its absolute fullest. From close-ups to angles to the framing and even the working with the black and white, all share one thing in common which is that it has been worked with brilliantly.This film deserves a watch and I will most definitely be re-watching it again sometime in the future. 'Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is what could be a true tale and brilliantly represents what the state of our world is and what it could lead to."
MovieKen,"Dec 23, 2006",6/10,"I just watched this movie for the first time last night, after having heard for several years about how great it is. Obviously, you can tell by the title of the film that this will have a pretty strong anti-military and anti-nuclear bomb political stance.Like another IMDb member said, it often seems that films that try to make a political statement are rated higher than they otherwise deserve to be. If Kubrick tried to make the opposite point (in favor of nuclear bombs, for example), I seriously doubt anyone would have seen this movie at all.I tried to set aside my own political views as I watched this film so that I could better judge it on its own merits. Those who do the same will probably find out that this is only a mediocre film, filled with wafer-thin characters and overacting. The script is sometimes witty, sometimes funny, but often it misses the mark because it overshoots its intended target.Peter Sellers' portrayal of the President of the United States seems to be the only characterization that makes its point without needing to go to the extreme. The rest of the actors (and characters) are way over the top in their performances, and I usually don't find this type of acting to be very funny or particularly impressive.In summary, this film was just OK. I've seen better movies and better satires, and I don't agree with its current rating on IMDb. All things considered, I think this film deserves a 6/10."
Bored_Dragon,"Nov 4, 2018",5/10,"I understood sarcasm and the message this movie brings, but the idea doesn't make a good movie. This was one of the most boring movies I have ever seen, and I've seen thousands. In what universe this may pass as a comedy?! Besides a few mediocre jokes, most of it wasn't funny at all. I barely endured to the end and I wouldn't watch it again even if my life depended on it. For entertainment qualities I would rate it zero out of ten, but because the essential idea is good I'll compromise with4,5/10"

William_E_Hunter,"Aug 7, 1998",10/10,"Without a doubt one of the greatest comedies of all time. Probably the strongest testament to the brilliance of this film is the fact that even though it was made over 30 years ago, the film does not seem dated at all and its various comments on the insanity of nuclear war are just as relevant as when it was first released. Sellers delivers an absolute tour-de-force acting job in his triple role as bumbling US president Muffley, the stuffy-yet-courageous Col. Mandrake, and the lunatic genius Strangelove. And as with all great films, the supporting characters are just as strong, including George C. Scott as gung-ho commie-hating General ""Buck"" Turgidson, and Slim Pickens as patriotic redneck bomber pilot Major Kong. Strangelove, like all of Kubrick's masterpieces, just gets better and better upon repeat viewing. Do yourself a favour and check this one out.And take care of your precious bodily fluids! POE"
thinker1691,"Nov 1, 2008",9/10,"In all the years of film making, Peter Sellers never disappointed an audience. No matter what the part, he always seem to find the perfect voice and therefore, his character. If you put him together with other equally great character actors like, George C. Scott who plays maniacal Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson and Sterling Hayden as the insane Brig. Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Jack The Ripper?) and the Slim Pickens as Maj. T.J. 'King' Kong, James Erle Jones as Lt. Lothar Zogg, the bombardier and Peter Bull as the Russian Ambassador Alexi de Sadesky, then you not only have an award winning film, but the secret formula for a Classic. The story is set in the sixties, during the Cold War and a lunatic Air Wing Commander intentionally gives the ""Gold Code Signal for his wing to attack Russia. What follows is a dramatic minute ticking film, designed to illuminate the military's ignorance, stupidity and final acquiescence of the doomsday, 'Fail-Safe' device. The entire movie is a comedy of errors and one reflected of Standly Kubrick's genius. The one sequence where Major Kong rides a nuclear missal to its target is synonymous with the mentality of the pentagon. Through the passage of time, this superb movie has not only become a Dark Classic, but a possible statement of the future reality of the human race. ****"
joseangel,"Feb 24, 2004",N/A,"First off, why would they put this sap-like slow director's ego trip in the comedy section? I laughed a grand total of 3 TIMES the whole movie! This movie is confusion between a badly scripted thriller and a stale black humor comedy. Anybody name more than three parts of this movie when you laughed and why you think it was funny. The one positive of this movie is Peter Sellers acting. The character development was terrible. The scene definition was pale. The ending was a horrible attempt at ""different"". I can probably name 10 movies from the 60s that are decidedly better than this movie and I could probably name 100 comedies that would make the majority of viewers laugh harder and more often than this flick. If only I didn't feel horrible for spending any more time critiquing this film. This movie is an utter disgrace to all other top 100 movies to IMDB and a definite waste of your time.

moonspinner55,"Dec 4, 2005",7/10,"From Peter George's book ""Red Alert"", turned by writer-director Stanley Kubrick into a movie signpost of the paranoid times. Plot has the American President trying to assimilate and explain unprovoked A-Bomb attack by the U.S. on Russia. Peter Sellers (in three wonderfully different roles) is amazing, George C. Scott just as good as matter-of-fact sergeant. Dark-humored essay on the craziness of war is troubling, disturbing, often highly entertaining.

mdarrenu,"Apr 13, 2019",9/10,I just watched part of it again today (April 2019) and actually realized that there is a fundamental flaw in the plot of the script compared to the reality of the last 30 years. It is not the general that are crazy and want to make war - it is the politicians. I like intellectual material but I have never found this movie very gripping or perhaps its satire like much of sellers is too broad for me. I appreciate his work - but I always find him a bit flat. I can't rate it less than a 9 - or I will lose credibility. But overall the movie still doesn't hit me as much as it does other people.

gbill-74877,"Apr 19, 2019",9/10,"Marvelous satire from Kubrick, and one that clicks on all cylinders - visually beautiful, lots of funny moments, and sharp commentary on the military, cold war, and threat of nuclear annihilation. A perfect encapsulation of the period, and yet ahead of its time as well. Brilliant performances from Peter Sellers in his three roles, George C. Scott, and Slim Pickens. The imagery is so biting - that cowboy hat, ""peace is our profession"", and the third reich salutes. The sexual overtones throughout the film add another layer of commentary, starting with the plane refueling and in many references to virility, signaling an aspect that has always been part of the military and those who would make war (perhaps the ultimate 'toxic masculinity' ... and making me think of the George Carlin bit about it not being manly to 'pull out' of Vietnam).We see the risk to humanity from our own selves in various 'big' ways - someone going rogue, the depraved indifference over 'only' 10-20 million dying, and the irrational fear of the other side being ahead, of there being any kind of ""gap."" We also see it in our little foibles, like pettiness, jealousy, and lust, and in the ignorant belief in conspiracy theories like that around fluoridation (which was a real thing). And interestingly, we also see the risk to humanity from automation and computers getting into an irreversible, destructive state, perhaps prefetching HAL in 2001, and the concerns of AI decades later. Mostly of all though, it points out the idiocy of the arms race, prompted by living in fear - messages which are still so important today - and it does this in way that is both delightfully over the top, but also includes the essence of truth."

Scott (many remember him as gen.Patton), Slim Pickens (with one of the most justifiably famous scenes in cinema history), Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn.. Due to the masterful hand of Kubrick, the film is perfectly staged; not a moment is wasted and every scene contains wonderful dialog and black humor.

ThomasGlebe,"Oct 23, 2025",10/10,"""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" from 1964, directed, co-written, and produced by Stanley Kubrick, remains one of cinema's most audacious and incisive satires, skewering the absurdities of Cold War paranoia with razor-sharp precision and black humor. Released at a time when the threat of nuclear war felt disturbingly real, barely a year after the Cuban Missile Crisis, following the assassination of President Kennedy, and during an election year shadowed by fear and uncertainty, the film captured the world's jittery unease with eerie accuracy and outrageous humor. Where Sidney Lumet's Fail Safe, released the same year, treated accidental nuclear catastrophe with grim seriousness, Kubrick found in the same premise a kind of cosmic joke, transforming doomsday into absurdist farce. Shot in stark black and white by cinematographer Gilbert Taylor, the film exposes the lunacy of military logic and political hubris with deadpan brilliance. Peter Sellers delivers a tour de force in three unforgettable roles: the befuddled British officer Mandrake, the ineffectual U. S. President Muffley, and the titular ex-Nazi scientist Strangelove, each representing a different strain of bureaucratic madness. George C. Scott's manic General Buck Turgidson and Sterling Hayden's deranged General Ripper embody Kubrick's critique of masculine bravado and ideological fanaticism. Slim Pickens is also unforgettable as Major T. J. ""King"" Kong, bringing cowboyish charm and darkly comic energy that perfectly complements the film's satirical tone. Ken Adam's iconic War Room set is striking, and the screenplay co-written by Terry Southern is filled with quotable dialogue and memorable scenes throughout. The true genius of this masterpiece is that it is an antiwar film disguised as a comedy, a rare commodity at that time. It would go on to influence many other anti-war comedies soon thereafter, because the Vietnam War was about to get really unfunny. This marked a major turning point in Stanley Kubrick's career, establishing him not just as a skilled craftsman but as a bold and original auteur. Having already directed acclaimed films like Paths of Glory (another anti-war marvel) and Spartacus, Kubrick used Dr. Strangelove to forge his own distinct voice, blending satire, precision, and philosophical irony in a way that would define his later films. This movie is historic in its own right, not only for being hysterically funny in ways so subtle that one almost needs to rewatch it again and again. Fortunately, it is so sharp and on target that watching this classic never grows tiresome. Both a time capsule of its era and a timeless warning about human folly, this amazing movie endures as one of the greatest political comedies ever made and perhaps the only one to make the end of the world seem both inevitable and absurdly funny. Not to be missed."
chera_khalid,"May 10, 2025",8/10,"Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964) is a bold, darkly comedic exploration of nuclear war, absurdity, and human folly. With your 8/10 rating, it's clear that you appreciate the film's sharp wit and its ability to balance absurd humor with chilling political commentary, making it a timeless classic that transcends its Cold War setting.Set against the backdrop of an ever-impending nuclear disaster, the film takes us into the tense and farcical world of military officers, government officials, and scientists who are caught in a crisis of their own making. The plot kicks off with a rogue American general, Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), ordering a nuclear strike on the Soviet Union, which sets off a series of increasingly absurd events as the U. S. government scrambles to stop the attack. With tensions mounting, the characters' incompetence, paranoia, and bizarre egos collide, making for a uniquely surreal satire of the Cold War mentality.The acting in Dr. Strangelove is, without a doubt, one of its greatest strengths. Peter Sellers, in a tour-de-force performance, plays three distinct roles: the bumbling, pacifist British officer Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the U. S. President Merkin Muffley, and the eccentric, ex-Nazi scientist Dr. Strangelove. Each performance is a study in contrast, from Mandrake's nervous, by-the-book manner to the President's nervous diplomacy, and finally, the outlandish Dr. Strangelove, who teeters on the edge of madness and genius. Sellers' versatility is absolutely mesmerizing, and his ability to portray such distinct characters with equal parts humor and humanity makes the film feel alive with energy.George C. Scott, as the over-the-top General Buck Turgidson, brings an extra layer of absurdity to the film. His performance is flamboyant and ridiculous in the best possible way, capturing the manic energy of a man who believes that nuclear war is just another military operation to be managed. His character provides some of the film's most memorable moments, especially in his increasingly comical, yet chillingly earnest, discussions about the need for ""preemptive"" war.The direction by Kubrick is masterful, blending farce with deep cynicism in a way that only he could achieve. The film's tone walks a razor-thin line between comedy and horror, with the absurdity of the situation becoming more apparent as the stakes get higher. Kubrick uses visual motifs, such as the bizarre, sterile sets of the war room and the claustrophobic, tension-filled moments between characters, to reflect the artificial and cold nature of political and military power. His tight, deliberate pacing and sense of timing make the absurdity feel all the more real and terrifying.The cinematography by Gilbert Taylor is stark and precise. The wide shots of the war room, the tight angles in the bomber cockpit, and the surreal imagery throughout the film all serve to highlight the madness of the situation. Taylor's framing underscores the themes of confinement and helplessness, emphasizing how the characters are trapped in their own absurd beliefs and actions. The visual design, including the iconic imagery of the B-52 bomber and the war room, has become etched in pop culture, further cementing the film's lasting impact.The screenplay, written by Kubrick and Terry Southern, is sharp, biting, and filled with memorable lines. The dialogue is an intricate blend of satire, dark humor, and biting commentary. The characters speak in deadpan tones, which makes the absurdity of their situations all the more hilarious. The film is filled with witty one-liners, such as Dr. Strangelove's ""Mein Führer, I can walk!"" and President Muffley's calm, diplomatic voice as he tries to manage a global crisis over the phone. The cleverness of the script allows Kubrick to explore serious political themes while simultaneously mocking the very systems that lead to such catastrophic decisions.The film's score, composed by Laurie Johnson, is surprisingly light and playful, which contrasts wonderfully with the dark and serious themes of the movie. The use of classical music, especially the cheerful, almost whimsical pieces that accompany some of the more absurd moments, helps heighten the film's satirical tone, reinforcing the irony of the situation. The music adds to the feeling of unease, suggesting that even in the face of impending destruction, life continues with a disarming lack of seriousness.At its core, Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant satire that exposes the absurdities of war, particularly nuclear war, and the dangers of unchecked military and political power. The film ridicules the bureaucratic and mechanized systems that led to the nuclear arms race, portraying a world where the people in charge are often more interested in posturing and maintaining control than in resolving the crisis at hand. It's a scathing commentary on the Cold War and the terrifying potential for self-destruction in the hands of those with power but little common sense.Your 8/10 rating likely reflects the film's successful blend of comedy and tragedy, its spot-on performances, and its eerie relevance even decades after its release. Dr. Strangelove may occasionally feel dated in its historical context, but the film's core themes-human folly, the dangers of blind authority, and the absurdity of war-remain as pertinent today as they were in 1964.In conclusion, Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant, darkly comedic masterpiece that skewers the political and military systems of its time while providing timeless insights into human nature. With its memorable performances, sharp writing, and satirical tone, it's a film that will leave you laughing while also making you reflect on the fragility of global peace. Kubrick's genius shines through in every frame, making Dr. Strangelove an essential watch for fans of cinema and political satire alike."
ccthemovieman-1,"Jun 15, 2006",7/10,"Like ""Cool Hand Luke"" which followed several years after this and then other films of the mid-60s, this was another milestone in Liberal advancement in Hollywood movies. Here, instead the rebel, anti-authority hero exemplified in the above-mentioned film, here we see another theme that have been repeated endlessly since the '60s: the military as the enemy, as a bunch of gung-ho war-bent trigger-happy idiots who get sadistic pleasure out of needlessly killing the enemy.Terry Southern, one of the big protesters of the '60s co-wrote this story with Stanley Kubrick and Peter George: not exactly three ""moderates."" The movie also pokes fun at those who opposed Communism, which helps explain why they investigated Hollywood in the first place.Nevertheless, once you get past that agenda of the film, it's very entertaining thanks to funny characterizations by George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn and others and by some excellent black-and-white cinematography. Peter Sellers plays three roles in here, but is best as the President of the U.S.Scott, with an outlandish Patton-like performance (no wonder he got that role later on), is particularly good with his facial expressions as ""Buck Turgidson."" Hayden, meanwhile, was always a favorite from the 1950s film-noir days. There are some good facial closeups of him, too.The ending of this movie is quite memorable, with Slim Pickens riding shotgun on a nuclear bomb as it descends. Now that is good, dark humor, punctuated by the tune ""We'll Meet Again"" as atomic bombs go off.Very biased, but a funny and entertaining 93 minutes and photographed so well it's fascinating to watch for that alone."
noahcooperider,"Jul 13, 2009",10/10,"When I first watched Dr. Strangelove, I was confused why it was in the top 250 at all, but now watching it a second time, I realize the true hilarity of the movie, and how it pokes fun at the most serious matter of all, doomsday.Everything about this movie screams serious, but also at the same time is one of the best examples of subtle comedy. It also is hilarious that the main characters, are mostly played by the same actor, Peter Sellers. (Mandrake, The President, and Dr. Strangelove)Also, I would have given this movie a 9 if it was not for the very last line in the entire movie, which was so hilarious that I bumped it up and entire number. It literally is that funny.This is not THE BEST movie ever made, but it is certainly one of the best, and it is a proud member of my collection."
leplatypus,"Feb 6, 2018",7/10,"In a cold war time and right after JFK assassination, what does Kubrick is indeed original: it's like if today we did a comedy about terrorism and while America keeps tight, only France did it so far with Youn and Vive la France.
Here the premise recalls what happens in Wargames (the human element to launch a nuclear attack) but in a reverse way (the attack is launched!): It's funny (and comforting) that the path to the actual detonation is very complicated and not limited as a single red button to push like we are told. The military sets and equipment looks very accurate and in this cold, serious world, it's very unusual to find indeed comedy: I remember Hot Shots but here there's no really patriot feeling but frightening humans behavior: the military mind to look for an enemy to attack, the amoral and amnesic use of Nazi scientists for the arms race... There is also a lot of hidden things to notice: I like the army tagline Peace is our profession because it parallels our french name of military forces: Defense Ministry while in fact we keep attacking!
Scott is really good as a obsessional general (wilder than Patton) and Sellers is indeed a master of disguise because I didn't get he was also playing the President (that's explain why I found this character a bit soft!). Watching him is a bit like watching another comedy genius, our french Les Nuls: he acts like Chabat with the look of late Bruno Carette."
Alan D,"Jan 29, 2002",10/10,"I love this movie. IMHO it the the best work that Kubrick ever did.  While the others all have great ""moments"". By this I mean that I can watch and enjoy every moment of it from begining to end - which is more than I can say about the rest of his works. The opening ape sequence of 2001 is too long and the ending is too ""enigmatic"" for me. Full Metal Jacket is a film of two halves, the first being far more interesting than the second. Clockwork Orange is overated, Eyes Wide Shut has Tom Cruise - hence I can't ever get beyond the the first few minutes, etc. etc.I know that some of the model work is a bit shakey and that the special effects are somwhat suspect. Nevertheless, from the point of cast, performances, script, storyline, humour, intelligence, painfully funny imagery, Dr, Strangelove surpasses the rest.Even though it is nearly 40 years old, the film is still relevant - the B52's are still flying and I could easily see Good Ole boy George W. sitting astride that bomb at the end. Ye Haw!"
kerwin-3,"Nov 9, 1998",10/10,"Forget about Citizen Kane or Gone With the Wind - this Kubrick classic is the best movie ever made. The movie alternates between the deepest political issues of the day and pure farce. Its ""messages"" about the dangers of nuclear war should speak louder today than in 1963. As the English writer Martin Amis concluded (regarding nuclear war), it is thinkable!"
ericjg623,"May 29, 2002",9/10,"While this movie isn't quite in the same league for all-out hilarity as such comedy icons as ""Airplane!"" or ""Clerks"", it nonetheless is a classic in its own right. Quite simply, this film asks the question - what could possibly be funny about nuclear war? Well, as it turns out, quite a lot. We have an Air Force general who flips out and, on his own authority, sends his bombers to attack the USSR. At his side is an RAF officer who doesn't seem to know quite how to deal with the whole situation. On a larger scale, the president and his men are assembled in the War Room as they attempt to placate the Soviet Premier (who just happens to be drunk) in an effort to avoid Armageddon. Not that it matters, as it turns out, one lone American bomber gets through, thus triggering the Doomsday Device, and ending all life on Earth. Well, not entirely, for it seems that a mysterious Dr. Strangelove has concocted a plan in which all virile males can hide out in the nation's deepest mineshafts and reproduce (at a ratio of ten women to each man) so as to assure the continuation of the human race despite all the radiation on the planet's surface.On the surface, this sounds like a recipe for a mess, yet director Stanley Kubrick makes it work. To be honest, this is really Peter Sellars' movie; it is he who deserves the lion's share of the credit for this film's enduring success. For example, when I first saw this movie some 15 years ago, I had no idea that Sellars played the three leads in this film, I had him pegged only as the veddy proper British officer Lionel Mandrake, not having the slightest clue that he also played the geekish American president as well as the nutcase German scientist Dr. Strangelove. It is to Sellars' credit that he managed to play such different characters while making each utterly convincing. In addition, much credit is due to George Scott as the bombastic General Turgison. The scenes where he stares down the president while stuffing gum in his face are definitely priceless. And, last but not least, is the Soviet ambassador DeSadeski, who alternates from being menacing to being ludicrous. There are rumors that Slim Pickens (the B-52 pilot) was never told this was a satire, and was requested to play the role straight. This I find hard to buy; anyone who recalls the part where he reads off the contents of the survival kits, which include such items as lipstick, condoms, and nylon stockings, will find it hard to believe he could do that scene with a straight face without being in on the joke. Also, there are a number of acts of sheer farce, such as when Mandrake is forced to order Col. `Bat' Guano to shoot open a Coke machine in order to get change to phone the president to put an end to the nuclear crisis. There are some ""Airplane!"" style sight gags, most notably when the B-52 is flying low over Russia but its shadow is that of a World War 2 B-17. And the pacing is also dead on. At first, there is little evidence this is actually a satire, one could easily watch the first half hour or so and fully believe they were seeing a serious (albeit, rather corny and low budget) war film. But, in time, the humor builds, such that, by the end, the president and his men are contemplating the advantages of being holed up in a mineshaft with hordes of women chosen primarily for their sexually stimulating attributes when all the while Strangelove is trying (and failing) to suppress his rabid love for his `Fuehrer'.In the final analysis, this movie has a lot going for it, but it also has its flaws. Most notably, it is politically dated. Apparently the impetus behind Gen. Ripper's plan to attack the USSR is that he thinks the `Rooskies' have plotted to contaminate our water supply with fluoride. I guess, back when this movie was released, people could relate since the notion of flouridization as a `Commie plot' was popular among conspiracy theory nuts at the time, but to a modern audience, the reference just seems out of date. Also, it seems to suggest that opponents of communism were nothing more than paranoid knuckle dragging Neanderthals, a notion that has hardly withstood the test of time. Finally, there are the silly names and sexual innuendo. I guess having names like General Jack Ripper and Premier Kissoff has a certain entertainment value, but at the same time they seem childish, like something I'd have called my teachers behind their back in 5th grade. Quite honestly, Beavis and Butt-head came up with funnier names when they tried to join the army as Major Woody and Private Parts. And having Ripper ramble on about the loss of his precious bodily fluids was no doubt sexually risqué in the 1960's, but by today's standards it just seems, well, icky. But these are nitpicks. On the whole, this movie has stood the test of time and remains a classic from its era.9/10"
ShaneC-404,"Sep 28, 2025",10/10,"Dr Strangelove came out in 1964 during the height of the Cold War. A lot of the world was paranoid that nuclear annihilation would happen 17 years ago the USA dropped the bomb on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which killed millions and left a devastating impact on Japan which can still be felt today even now countries like Israel are dropping bombs on hamas and killing Palestinian civilians the movie Dr Strangelove showed the dark truth behind the Cold War.Something that makes Dr Strangelove one of the most brilliant satires is the acting,Peter sellers,George c Scott and sterling hayden are great in the movie their acting makes the movie amazing and the character of Dr Strangelove. A wheelchair bound general with a nazi side is one of the most scariest and tense characters in any movie. Geroge C Scott is Great at playing the general buck turdigson. Overall this movie is amazing 10/10."

When movies can make a really good point using humour, but without the humour being offensive or seemingly inappropriate, then it is a success in my view. I particularly liked Seller's Mandrake role, he had some very funny scenes. I would recommend this to people of all ages, it's funny and makes you think."

slokes,"May 30, 2006",7/10,"At Burpelson AFB, Gen. Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has decided the time has come to rid the world of Communist infiltration of the water supply, and sends his B-52s on a sneak attack against the Soviet Union. Months of drinking nothing but rainwater and grain alcohol, not to mention denying the women in his life his ""essence,"" apparently went to his head.On one of the B-52s Ripper sends out, Maj. T.J. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens) dons his cowboy hat and tells his men folks back home are counting on them to see this through: ""That goes for every last one of you, regardless of your race, your color, or your creed.""As Kong's plane approaches its target, his progress is observed worriedly in Washington D.C. President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) tries diplomacy with a drunken Soviet premier, while Gen. Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) suggests going through with a full-scale attack.""I will not go down in history as the greatest mass murderer since Adolph Hitler,"" President Muffley says.""Perhaps it might be better, Mr. President, if you were more concerned with the American people than with your image in the history books,"" Turgidson replies.""Dr. Strangelove,"" like the War Room where much of it is set, is a cold and imposing work of art, impressive though distancing. As a film of its time, ""Strangelove"" is arguably Kubrick's most important work, a cultural crossroads between nihilism and pop where anything goes, and everything does at the end. All that, and it's pretty funny, too.Sellers plays three roles, though his antic comic energy is largely tamped down with two of the characters, Muffley and a RAF officer assigned to Ripper's base. His third character, the titular Dr. Strangelove, is a wonderful Germanic riff and the film's zaniest figure, though the farthest removed from events at hand. He's all for war, but whether that's because he's as mad as the others or trying to make the best of a bad situation is left unclear.I don't love ""Dr. Strangelove,"" and there are things about it that grate, like the long inventories and protocols we see in the B-52. Scott has his great moments as the unwound Turgidson, but overacts shamelessly in others, which Scott blamed on his director. Keenan Wynn as a colonel named Bat Guano is stiff, too, but Sellers is very good and Pickens and Hayden even better, playing their roles straight with just the slightest sense of irony. (I think both knew they were in a comedy.)For a film about mutually assured destruction, there is a nice MAD magazine sensibility to this film, in the goofy names and outré situations, that fits the mood of the times and makes this an enjoyable black comedy. The jokes hit their targets, and points are made without deference to a particular ideology, as hawks like Turgidson and doves like Muffley both take fire. Kubrick made films liberals love, but he himself wasn't a true believer of any stripe, and it shows here.The best part of ""Strangelove"" for me is the titles sequence, showing B-52s refueling in flight. Even after you get the joke behind it, there's still something to those remarkable images, an aerial ballet perfectly synchronized with the Pablo Ferro titles and a violin-heavy rendition of ""Try A Little Tenderness,"" that strikes a chord deep inside.Maybe the chord struck by the rest of the film is not so in evidence anymore, but ""Dr. Strangelove"" is still a good comedy and valid social commentary worth watching."
Neil-900,"Nov 13, 2009",1/10,"Not one single attempt at humour for the first 32 minutes. That's a third of the film, After that the jokes come at about one every 5 to 10 minutes and at best made me smile but mostly made me cringe.This is another example of the Kubrick delusion. The faithful dogmatically believe that the lord Kubrick is all perfect and everything he does is utterly wonderful, every film he makes is the finest movie masterpiece there is.If Kubrick says it is a comedy then his worshippers announce it the funniest film ever made.This film is NOT funny however many deluded fools say it is. This is barely even a comedy by any definition I am aware of.If you are a massive Kubrick fan then maybe you should watch this film but go in with open eyes and accept that you won't laugh, not even once.1/10"
MickMalarkey,"Feb 10, 2025",10/10,"I'm writing this review after my fourth or maybe even fifth rewatch of Dr. Strangelove. This is absolutely not only my favourite comedy but also one of my favourite movies ever.One thing that I have to point out though about a movie like Dr. Strangelove is, comparing it to other comedies like Naked gun or Pink Panther, Strangelove didn't make me lose my mind laughing. But it did something that I appreciated even better.Strangelove is best described as a satire, and satirical comedy just works a bit differently from other types of comedies.The typical comedy, which aims to simply make you laugh as much as it can, would normally rely on you to anticipate a punchline and it would constantly have something random and funny happening in order to keep you entertained.Once you see the punchline or that random thing coming, it is no longer quite as funny. Just like a movie with a twist is less mind blowing the second time, and all the setups to the twist become less engaging.You can appreciate these movies on the rewatches, but then you are more focused on building a stance towards the films rather than experiencing the films, it just becomes naturally more difficult. This obviously applies to every single movie ever made, but a surprise is only quite as exciting the first time, the next time it isn't a surprise.But, I find it that Dr. Strangelove is engaging even if I know what happens next, and that is very interesting to me.I believe the strenght of Dr. Strangelove is in the fact it is, or rather works as, a character study. The surprises happen often, but they aren't where the humour is, by themselves, these surprises are pretty scary. The humour is in how these surprises serve the portrayal of the satirized characters. It is their very being that is funny, the rest of the movie is there to provide context for their behavior, and in turn, their personalities.And I would say, with that in mind, this movie brilliantly succeded. It had just the right, intense plot, that would create conflict between the characters and also conflict within the characters, individually, in order to have the characters manifest their satirized personalities on screen. The casting was fantastic, not only for the acting but also just the choice of how the actors look and their tone of voice.The movie has a great rewatch value. It is rich with details and underhanded jokes, and the characters mannerisms are so engaging as they always tell something more about the character.Each character carries a different message but each message compliments the greater theme. And that theme is scary, without these characters, this would be a horror movie. And the absurdity of this contrast only becomes more funny the more you can associate it with the real world.In here comes the title, or at least a part of it. 'How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb'. Learning to love the bomb is learning to identify and enjoy the humour behind one of the most threatening concerns worldwide since the end of the second world war, it speaks so well to the attitude of the film.I think it will forever be one my favourite movies, and I have to admit that compared to some of my other all time favourites, this one just doesn't seem to lose its charm on me."
Qwerty-6,"Oct 1, 1998",10/10,"In my opinion, this is the best movie ever made.  It mixes great comedy with a very serious and important issue.  Stanley Kubrick does an amazing job directing this film.  The ending is my favourite in movie history.  Peter Sellers and George C. Scott give fabulous performances as usual.  I have never seen anything as funny and as frightening at the same time before or since."
terrencejmorton,"Jul 16, 2025",10/10,"I of course watched through the Kubrick filmography as a teen, and upon first viewing of Dr. Strangelove, it was good, clever, but ultimately forgettable for me. Compared to many of the color Kubrick productions, I rarely thought about the movie, and never merited it a rewatch.Boy was that a mistake. While described as a satire or black comedy, my second viewing as an adult was a true mix of giggling fits and abject horror. Kubrick masterfully hides subtle warnings and serious commentary on the inclinations of the average American man to destroy the world for an ideal within absurd, hilarious, and obnoxious characters. The physical comedy of the title character, Dr. Strangelove, is at first not well understood, and increasingly becomes an on the nose metaphor for, well, you decide.While the film certainly appears dated to a 2025 viewer, there are the typical hallmarks of Kubrick's quality and attention to detail."
JJohnson-2,"Nov 7, 1998",10/10,"Peter Sellers genius reappears in his multiple protrayals of Captain Mandrake and Dr. Strangelove. He is just unstoppable, a brilliant character actor and a fresh wit.

Portis_Charles,"Sep 26, 2025",10/10,"It is the most perfectly absurdist and hilarious depiction of a demented process towards a final nuclear Apocalypse. The filming is hyper-precise and a beautiful watch in itself. There is always something of a quasi-documentary accuracy in Kubrick's films, even to the point of being a bit fastidious at times.I feel this is a lesson that has been forgotten by too many comedies. As their primary goal is getting the laughs, they concentrate on the humorous dynamics and tend to forget the rest. It might get them big scores at the box office, but no spot in the history of cinema. Kubrick was a different animal of course. This last scene with Dr. Strangelove planning a post-apocalyptic future is an absolute summit of acting by Peter Sellers and of cinema."
magic_marker,"Aug 2, 2002",10/10,"Who says this movie has dated?It is more relevent than ever with our very own Major Kong in the White House, ready to ride that bomb to glory, and Pearle and Rumsfeld as raging Tugidsons taking the hawkish mentality to the point of absurdity. And who can forget our own, lost Mandrake, Colin Powell, the outnumbered voice of reason.This film will never age because ultimately it is not about the Cold War; it is about the stupidity of absolute power. Why do humans feel the need to invest the power to destroy the world in anyone, let alone someone who yells about ""Mine shaft gaps"" or for that matter, one who thinks he was a small business growth.Kubrick, no idealist, understood the nature of evil better than most. He knew that evil does not eminate solely from charismatic individuals but rises like smog from the collective stupidity and madness of many people, some of whom may not be evil in themselves.In the knife-edge political climate of today, certain administrations would do well to heed his message."
dougdoepke,"May 5, 2017",N/A,"No need to repeat consensus on the movie's general brilliance. As I recall, Kubrick's withering black humor created quite a stir, coming in the midst of Cold War conformity. In loony jest, it even suggests our leaders might be no better (maybe even worse) than the perfidious Soviets. Needless to say, that appeared unpatriotic to many. Nevertheless, it's the inspired lunacy of the acting and writing that makes this bitter pill go down. What stays with me is the movie's obsessive attention to technical detail, whether switch flipping in Kong's bomber, communication set-ups stateside, or the War Room's big board. Lying at the core is that utter contrast between technological expertise, on one hand, and mocking lunacy of the guys in charge, on the other. What the movie seems to say, if you will, is that the same collective intelligence that can create technical marvels is too wacko to use them intelligently. I suspect the lesson still applies, as the movie cleverly implies."
gtjgw,"Oct 30, 2006",10/10,"It is a mark of quality that this film is perhaps as relevant today as it was when it was made. Even more remarkable that it has such power at all considering how silly it comes across, yet there is surely no other film that gets its message to the viewer in quite such a brilliant way. It is the fact that the characters are portrayed as so stupid that makes the message so powerful, alongside the pessimistic ending of the film. Peter Sellars proves what an exceptional actor he was by playing his various roles with aplomb. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden back Sellars up with similarly impressive creations who last long in the memory. As for the late legend Stanley Kubrick, this - closely followed by Full Metal Jacket - is his true masterpiece. There is most certainly no other film like it and to attempt to make a film with such serious issues and film it as a farce is obviously a difficult thing to do successfully. Finally, every person in the world should see this film because it has the simple but effective message that politics of fear is a bad thing for the world, a message that still needs to made today, perhaps more than ever."
rebeccalucy,"Dec 4, 2017",7/10,"Hyperbolic fun, with strange characters to highlight the point. Has a unique story that is executed very well and tries to show what could possibly happen if nuclear weapons were used.I enjoyed the characters of Buck and Mandrake, both are unlike any other characters I have seen before. Buck has a great delivery of lines with his booming voice whereas Mandrake has a likable charm. The president was very interesting too, his conversations on the phone are so absurd they become funny. However, sometimes I found it a little hard to follow the plot.The editing and cinematography are very good too, with a large long shot that is contrasted with an extreme close up later. This highlights the tension between the characters and is key to the understanding of the film. Overall, a great satire with great cinematography."
Skottbeers,"Jan 9, 2005",1/10,"Last night I noticed the best comedy according to IMDb was on HBO on-demand so I figured I would watch it and see how funny it really is.After watching it for about 30 minutes I thought to myself... ""Wow, when is the comedy going to begin?"" Before I knew it the movie was over and I had yet to laugh. I don't understand how so many people could of voted this to become #1, its amazing so many have a sense of humor this dull.Maybe it was funny when it came out 41 years ago, but I would not recommend it to anyone who is younger than 25 years of age.I could easily say that I would rather have watched any Adam Sandler movie, and we know how bad some of those can be."
juan_valdez_de_la_penna,"Sep 11, 2003",10/10,This movie is a masterpiece of it's time. It illustrates (ironically) the madness that was reality. Peter Sellers shines as never before in his roles and adds an outstanding comedic touch to this excellent movie.
cricketbat,"Aug 30, 2018",8/10,"What can be said about this movie? It's a classic. One of the great films. A silly comedy about a very serious subject. If you haven't seen this one yet, it's about time you did."
alooftrashman,"May 11, 2010",9/10,"The year is 1964. Communists are coming in at all sides, America's biggest fear is to succumb to the nuclear bomb and the Soviet Union. So a movie is made, and Stanley Kubrick is at its helm. The result is Dr. Strangelove.A movie about a meglomaniacal general wanting to foster a war, it starts with its dark comedy right off the bat. I found Peter Sellers in all of his various roles in this movie on the top of his game, I was laughing with every line and thinking about every other line. The framing of each scene was also exquisite, I found myself rewatching countless dialog scenes just to take in all the ambiance.The plot itself was a little tough to follow, with its abstract story structure. That being said, the plot itself I think was taking a backseat to all of the thematic structuring of the United States love affair with the atomic bomb and death and destruction.A fantastic movie, worth watching for any history major."
hydershahzeb,"Aug 8, 2016",9/10,"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is a 1964 movie directed by Stanley Kubrick. It is a brilliant dark comedy depicting the paranoia and fear surrounding the nuclear proliferation at the heights of cold war.The plot of the movie revolves around the arms race and cold war between USA and erstwhile USSR resulting in a nuclear fallout throughout the world. The movie starts with United States Air Force Brigadier General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) giving the go code to B-52 bombers of his wing for a nuclear attack on USSR without any provocation. He goes ahead and seals himself in his air-base and cuts off all communication knowing fully that it is impossible to recall the bombers without his recall codes.An emergency meeting is called by President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) of high profile generals of US Armed Forces at Pentagon. General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) briefs the President about the impending 'moment of truth' and tries to convince him for an all out attack on USSR which is ignored. Meanwhile back at the airbase, Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) finds out that General Ripper issued the go code for no good reason other than 'the commie boogeymen trying to pollute the natural fluids their enemies' and struggles to recall the bombers.People at Pentagon are also informed of the unstoppable Russian Doomsday device by Soviet Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) built to wipe out all life on earth in case Russia is attacked by Nuclear weapons. The combined efforts of Russians and Americans to stop bombers from reaching the target and the American adviser Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers) talking about steps to take in case of doom make the climax of the movie.Coming to the performances, Peter Sellers without a doubt shines brightly throughout the movie. He managed to play his three characters with equal finesse. George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden did full justice to their respective roles of General Turgidson and Brigadier General Ripper.However this movie solely belong to its director. Kubrick has managed to highlight the absurdity of the unfounded contempt of one towards the other and its consequences. He also brilliantly depicts the dangers of lack of credibility of elements of a power structure.This movie is definitely among the best political satire movies of all time."
robfwalter,"Mar 3, 2018",10/10,"This film is scintillating, excoriating, scorching...think of any violent word you can and it will describe this film. Forget action movies with their death counts of dozens or thousands of people. The stakes in this film are as high as they can be, with the world on the brink of nuclear war. The mechanics of military command are ruthlessly exposed and somehow I found the procedural details on B-52 bomber horribly enthralling.Oh, and it's very funny. Peter Sellars plays three roles and nails them all. The sequence of events is wonderfully absurd, except that there was a short talk before the screening I saw and the academic who spoke explained that declassified documents have revealed that the only false thing in the whole film is the disclaimer at the start (demanded by the airforce?) that says it couldn't happen. Alert to the prospect of a strategic strike on Washington that would destroy the only people capable of authorising a nuclear attack, the US government implemented a system just like the one in the film whereby individual generals could launch a nuclear strike.Similarly, the paranoia rings true - if the US had launched a nuclear attack, of course Soviet intelligence would have had every incentive to deceive those carrying out the attack into believing the order had been rescinded. And the fear of being left behind in any technological race rings true as well.Also it's hilarious: that music that plays every time the scene is on the B-52 bomber! But poignant and beautiful. The mountains sticking up above the clouds at the beginning are breathtaking and somehow sad and, particularly early on many of the shots of the plane flying are gorgeous. And the war room is such a brilliant set.So although satire can sometimes be distancing or alienating, with this film be prepared for lots of feelings."
Haziiiim18,"Feb 18, 2016",6/10,"One good thing in the narrative structure of the film is that there's no setup for the story; the film is one piece witch grabs you in the situation; it's an interesting tactic to tell such a story because it amplifies the dramatic tension of the film and it's so well adapted to this types of stories and sets it a great unique tone.The film is interesting and entertaining but I have some remarks on the character of the general Turgiston (very well played by the actor) who morphs sometimes into a clown witch is most of the time a rookie mistake for a satire and something that's i considered a beginner error; + Sellers portraying 3 roles in the films is bizarre, totally unnecessary and add to the clown show sometime this satire have."
mjneu59,"Nov 14, 2010",10/10,"Stanley Kubrick's end-of-the-world comedy was merely topical back in 1963; today the film is essential viewing. No other Cold War feature (and certainly no straight-faced drama) so accurately depicted the lethal absurdity of the arm's race, and the chilling consequences of one rational madman pushing the wrong buttons. The stark overhead lighting and low-level camera angles aptly illustrated the combined myopia of the military, scientific, and political communities, with all three represented by the versatile Peter Sellers in a characteristic triple performance. The supporting roles are no less memorable: George C. Scott as Air Force hawk Buck Turgidson; Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper (who initiates the apocalypse to ""protect and preserve our precious bodily fluids""); Slim Pickens as B-52 pilot Major Kong (riding the Bomb like a bucking bronco to oblivion). The giveaway names only underline the broad simplicity of the satire, but oddly enough the sometimes childish (black) humor makes an already frightening scenario all the more plausible."
paulclaassen,"Mar 17, 2024",7/10,"As you can probably gather from the film's full title, this is all about satire. General Jack Ripper (ha-ha!!) believes the enemy is approaching and issues an order to the B-52 wing carrying nuclear weapons to attack their targets in Russia.Convinced there is no threat, Captain Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers) requests Ripper to cancel the request, but Ripper refuses. Ripper is the only person who knows the code to cancel the attack. (The scenes involving these two characters were so wonderful!). Unable to reach Ripper or the planes, the President is trying to stop a potential disaster.I loved the film's presentation, the characters, and the dialogue. Pay careful attention to the dialogue; it is absolutely hilarious. I mean, dialogue like ""You can't fight in here; this is a war room"", and 'The self-destruct mechanism blew itself up""! The casting was well done and every single actor was perfect in their respective roles.The visual effects are not the greatest - in fact, even poor at times - but I believe this was intentional to coincide with the film's satire. I had an absolute blast with 'Dr. Strangelove'!"
HotPot,"Sep 23, 2010",4/10,"I do apologise: I'd somehow got it into my head that comedies are supposed to be funny. Then I remembered our greatest playwright's comedies and assumed that must be what Mr Kubrick was going for with this 'comedy'.I suppose he started off on the right track, getting Peter Sellers involved, but sadly (for a modern comedy at least) you tend to need a funny script rather than just a funny actor, and the script was certainly not funny. I'm sorry to say that Sellers' Dr. Strangelove came across as over-the-top and self-indulgent. He did as well as could be expected with the President character, given the mediocre script. I quite liked his English airman though: suitably snooty without being offensive.Many of the other actors (notably excluding James Earl Jones) were fairly rubbish, I thought; lots of overacting, presumably under the mistaken impression that this is what makes a good comedic performance.The story was original enough, although it basically fizzled out at the end, not knowing quite where to go and instead just stopping. It could have reached the end much more quickly too, if it hadn't been so flabbily edited; many was the scene I thought yeah, I get the point, let's move on...I'm trying to work out why I gave it as much as 4/10 now. It's ""of its time"" I suppose, so I shouldn't judge too harshly now.I realised, on reaching the end of the film, that I vaguely remember seeing it before at some point, but I suspect the vagueness of my recollection simply underlines what a forgettable film it is.I accept that far more people seem to like it than don't; I just can't work out why. But then I also can't work out why people think Kubrick is anything more than a below-average director. Sorry, Kubrick fans, but I'd have to recommend giving this one a wide berth."
kingstonsofia,"Mar 27, 2024",10/10,"I just watched this again after so many years and it works even better today than it did back then.The US military nutcases are still fighting the cold war by proxy through Ukraine, and all alternative methods are nixed by a coalition of the politicians and the media.George C Scott ( RIP, well I guess it's RIP to most of the cast as of today) gives a transcendental performance as a General, a performance that could be slotted in to any present day war movie.Sterling Hayden is fabulous as the deranged Brigadier General, hilariously named as Jack Ripper and you can just see so many avatars of him in the current collection of Pentagon Chiefs.Shining above them all is the incomparable Peter Sellers, playing three parts in a display of talent that hasn't been equalled in any movie since , he is just brilliant.I urge readers to just take a look at Scott's performance as Buck Turgidson (another fantastic name) when he is giving the President options for a first nuclear strike. The funniest part of the speech is when he forecast the number of deaths.... ""20 million max depending on the breaks "" It is just satiric genius.Remember, the same type of personalities are running today's weeping gelignite of an administration."
Kingslaay,"Nov 16, 2019",8/10,"Dr Strangelove does not take a breath from start to finish. At first you might think its a short or standard 1.5 hours but it covers a lot of content. The apparent dark humour is there amidst a very serious plot. It also shows the dangers that can unfold when people in command lose their minds. Also interesting that the President doesn't have as much power as you think. This is an intelligent film, great story and good performances. Peter Sellers shines in his 3 different roles. Kubrick carefully and meticulously shows the workings that lead to such conflict. A classic that can be watched again and a beacon of good film making. 8/10"
Ricc0,"Dec 10, 2016",10/10,"Considered to be one of the best dark comedies and political satires ever, Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the most amusing and brilliant films I have ever seen. The plot is rather simple.. an ill-minded and psychotic United States Air Force general launches a first strike ""preemptive"" nuclear attack against the Soviet Union exceeding his authority. The United States president then tries to stop the attack from the war room, communicating with the Soviets and their president to try everything possible to prevent a nuclear war that would destroy the world.One could say a lot about what makes this cold war classic among the best. The directing was ingenious with its various camera styles (Documentary, close ups, long shots - different styles for different locations)... cutting back and forth and keeping it consistent with the story... the varying pace (going faster and faster as the film gets nearer to its crazy, hilarious, and symbolic ending).The screenplay clever, innovative, and witty.. The acting superb.. Sellers, Scott, and Hayden had remarkable performances (especially for Sellers with his three distinct roles).. memorable phrases and jokes: ""Gentlemen you can't fight in here! This is the war room"". The score lovely and fit.Yet, the best thing about this movie is in its ideas, allegories, and metaphors. The film came in the mid 60s and that in itself is astonishing with what it held of its time's fears and the theories that all turned out to be true (as many critics and newspapers remarked).The film's major theory was connecting war with sexual desire. This was shown through various images (mating airplanes, spewing coke machines, ""impotent"" bombs, playboy magazine..), spelled out through words and phrases (""loss of essence"", ""Bodily fluids""..), hidden behind symbolic names (Jack Ripper: a killer especially of prostitutes, Merkin Muffley: female pubic area, Desadeski: perverted sexual love in the 18th century, and the same in Strangelove, Mandrake, Kissof..), and even presented in the only female character (Miss Scott) with her bathing suit or presence on the cover of a playboy magazine.Another important theme is how technology dominated human life. The film shows numerously how things are getting completely out of control and away from moralities. Also Capitalism gets its share of criticism through the memorable scene of Mandrake in the phone booth.. ""Shoot with a gun.. that's private property"". Moreover, the statement that has been used by many throughout history to justify massacres; ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more than ten to twenty million killed, tops, uh, depending on the breaks"", was brilliantly implemented in the plot.By focusing on the relation between war and sex, the film in return shows how the human conduct is leading to a lack of love. The only woman (that is a symbol of love and affection) is presented by one character and by sexual means.. also the theory of Dr. Strangelove at the end adds to it. This leads us to talk about arguably one of the weirdest characters in the history of cinema. His Nazi approach only points out that Nazism may occur in any of our acts, whether on the governmental, corporal, personal or any other level (and it is significantly present in the act of war); ""Mein Fuhrer! I can walk"".The anti-war (which is its overall theme) film succeeded in depicting the different aspects of the cold war from its politics to the paranoiac atmosphere that controlled the minds of nearly everyone. Throughout this feature Dr. Strangelove also succeeded in bringing philosophical theories that concern the human life. A masterpiece."

didi-5,"Jul 2, 2004",N/A,"This Kubrick goodie pokes fun at just about everything from war counsels to bomber planes, and includes a famed triple performance from Peter Sellers - he was to have been 'King' Kong, the Slim Pickens role as well, but this idea was eventually ditched.Aside from Sellers (for my money not at his best as Dr Strangelove himself, but as the President with the soothing voice 'now, listen, Dimitri ...'), there are some interesting names in the cast - George C Scott as the gung-ho general, Sterling Hayden as the mad brigadier Jack D. Ripper (ho ho), Keenan Wynn as the suspicious colonel, and the wonderful Peter Bull as the Russian ambassador.If you come to this film knowing little about it, you'll have a good time. And for once, even if you've seen the hilarious trailer, you'll be none the wiser.  Great use for Vera Lynn's 'We'll Meet Again', too."
JoshAndersonXLVIII,"Dec 25, 2010",7/10,"I haven't watched many movies from the 60's but found Dr. Strangelove to be witty & relevant. The conflict was an interesting situation birthed by Cold War paranoia and I was surprised by the hilarity of it all. It was interesting to note the limitations of technology & the part that played in a crisis involving the future of the entire planet! I also enjoyed the lackadaisical attitude the General had toward the whole thing and his typical American fear of the (at that time the ""Rooskies"")Commies.(I also finally found the sound clip the band Passifist used on their song Christ of the Nuclear Age!)"
coreymoquin,"Oct 20, 2011",7/10,"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb came out in 1964 during the height of the cold war. Kubrick's film has many recurring political themes such as improper leadership and nuclear war. It also has a deep theme of how pointless the tensions between the two factions were. Despite the film's subject matter the film is a comedy. Although, one could call it a dark comedy because it's almost impossible to take such serious themes and make them comedic. Kubrick was able to balance the line of seriousness and comedy to create a very intuitive film. 1964 and the sixties in general were a very tense time for the eastern and western world. Both sides were contending with a nuclear arms race, which terrified the public of both nations. This was most notably apparent in the Cuban missile crisis, which had just occurred a couple years before the film's release. This tension led to racism between the two worlds. In democratic countries this racism was connected to the ""red scare"". Both sides were very subjective of each other just because the country's governments were having issues with each other. The public was very frightened during this time. Kubrick took this opportunity to create a very controversial sort of film. He took a large risk when he decided to portray such a serious situation in a humorous light. The unique thing about this film is that mostly every thing is realistic and believable. The plot itself seems like something that could of actually happened during these times. A general who is so brainwashed into hating the communists so much that he becomes paranoid and finds a loophole to start a nuclear war. These circumstances seem true to life. Even the protocol the characters assume seems realistic. From meting at the war room, to contacting the leaders of Russia and hiring experts (Turgidson and Dr. Strangelove). However, despite having such a realistic and believable setting and plot the characters in the film create a large juxtaposition. This is where the film turns into a comedy. The characters are very tongue and cheek. General Turgidson, played by the late George C. Scott, is a perfect example of an unrealistic and ""goofy"" character. Turgidson constantly finds humor in dark situations, his girlfriend calls him during important meetings, and he is extremely racist. Then there is Dr. Strangelove who is supposed to be a genius scientist. He is an oddball character whose ideas and theories are only weirder than his need to call the president ""mien fuehrer"". All of these comedic characters add levity to the realistic situation that the film's plot has formed. One can say that Kubrick's characters are his ""weapons"". He uses his characters to poke fun at the cold war conflict. It's possible that the point of the film was to show how pointless the whole conflict was. The scene where General Turgidson is urging the president to create a mine so they don't have a ""mine gap"" is obviously alluding to the nuclear arms race and is showing the futility of such a thing. Perhaps Kubricks intentions were to ease the public's fear by showing the situation in a comedic light. It all depends on what the viewer takes away from the film. Dr. Strangelove was most certainly an intuitive film for weaving together serious issues and politics, and making it comedic, while still having a deep message to communicate."
mi2tere,"Jul 23, 2006",1/10,"One of my fav films is 2001 and I really like Kubrick's's films. My fav comedy has Peter Sellers in it. I like dark humour. But I found this film to be total crap, didn't laugh out loud once. This could have been so much more and if Peter Sellers was not in it this flick and Kubrick did not have his name to it then this film probably would have been placed in the correct chart ie the worst of comedy.On a positive note some of the characters are good ie the base commander, and Sellers as his side kick. Plus some elements of the war room were good and lets not forget the lad flying the bomber. But again, this could have been so much more. Big let down in my eyes!"
animal_8_5,"Jul 14, 2006",10/10,"My favorite line: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight here! This is the War Room!"" Peter Sellers at three times his best. George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and James Earl Jones made up this amazing cast.All I can say is that truth is stranger than fiction. In light of what is coming out about the secret societal connections of the U.S. President, Britain's PM and all world leaders, the writers appear to be dead on, suggesting a residual Nazi influence on the powers-that-be. Instead of having childish custard cream pie fights in the ""war room"", the elite who plan to rule the world are secretly dressing up like Santa Claus and whooping it up at the Bohemian Grove. Disgraceful.With the megalomaniacal powers out there making the blunders they continue to make, you wonder how we could all still be here today. There has to be a God!"
bobsgrock,"Jan 15, 2009",10/10,"For Stanley Kubrick, perhaps it was better to laugh at the problems of the world than to dread them. That certainly was the case here as Kubrick adapted Peter George's nuclear war novel Red Alert. However, Kubrick was wise enough to take this rather serious subject and force it under some very funny situations that for a minute take you away from the actual danger of the realities of nuclear war.From a cinematic point of view, this is just about perfect. The acting is spot-on, from George C. Scott's right-wing, hawk Gen. Turgidson, to Sterling Hayden's mad-cap General Ripper, to Peter Sellers' triple performance as Captain Mandrake, President Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove. Sellers, in particular gives one of the greatest performances in film as he flawlessly transits from character to character and is so believable as an uptight, downright British officer, a neurotic and plain American president, and a creepy yet brilliant former Nazi scientist. Nearly every line is memorable and perfectly captures an era where paranoid reigned supreme and you were instructed to trust no one.As for Stanley Kubrick, he is obviously poking fun at the sheer lunacy of this situation, yet he shows some deft seriousness as well. Sure, there is a better way to handle this, but there is no wrong in trying to save your own skin. Take it as you will, but there is no doubt that Kubrick has created one of the most inventive, memorable, and timeless films in American cinema. No matter what the state of world affairs is, Dr. Strangelove will always be significant."
roedyg,"May 1, 2013",10/10,"This is an absolutely brilliant movie. It may well be the best movie ever made. I first saw it in 1964. Dozens of its vivid scenes stuck with me over years. I saw it again just now in 2013. It was even better than I remembered it. It tackles the ultimate serious subject with perfect deadpan humour.The first time I saw it, I was tied up in the plot, and my frustration with all these idiots refusing to behave sensibly to save their skins. The second time I focused more on the human foibles it poked fun of, people reflexively concerning themselves with looking good, or seeking a petty advantage, even if the face of nuclear war. I carefully watched every gesture and eyebrow twitch, all as controlled as a renaissance painting.The first time, the scene that haunted me most was Colonel Bat Guano refusing to shoot a coke machine. The second time it was Mandrake trying to humour the out-of-his gourd Brigadier General Jack Ripper, and Dr. Strangelove selling his plan to live in mineshafts.The plot is brilliant. Everything crazy thing that happens comes with an airtight, plausible explanation. The technical mumbo jumbo and the ""advanced"" 1950s technology stands up very well. I was only jarred once by an erroneous explanation of half-life.This time I noticed a young James Earl Jones playing Lothar Zogg, one of the bomber crew. I did not notice him the first time because he had not yet become famous.The first time a saw it I remember thinking Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson (George C. Scott) and Major 'King' Kong (Slim Pickens) were quite elderly. This time they looked dewy-faced and even sexy."
dcerane,"Jan 19, 2016",9/10,"Funniest movie I have seen in my life (and for that alone, it earns my first review). There are moments during movie that you follow the dialogue and watch it progress and you feel fine, but then there are verbal 'bombs' (for lack of a better word) dropped on you and you can fall on the ground for laughing so hard.At some point in the move I was thinking: is it inappropriate that I'm entertained, and then I looked it up on IMDb to see the genre: and felt a bit relieved to see that it is indeed a comedy.The pace was so slow (and in the best way possible): you wonder how Kubrick managed to squeeze so much in so little screen time, yet nothing feels rushed, and everything gets enough time. Loved it! Recommend it to everyone!"
ajitmahadevan,"Jul 9, 2017",N/A,"This movie was released during the height of the cold war and it works because instead of inspiring panic or fear it uses satire and comedy to convey the sum of all fears.There are some great one liners... including President Merkin Muffley saying ""No fighting in the War Room""! It is Kubrick at his best with the genius of Peter Sellers and some great performances by George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden (Jack D. Ripper - what a name!). The chilling last lines of Dr Strangelove (including the Mein Fuhrer) are just writing genius.Today with North Korea again beginning to threaten Nuclear WAr - the ""Doomsday"" scenario - is again worth contemplating (tragically) - a truly memorable movie - one that will never grow old..."
beresfordjd,"Apr 29, 2007",4/10,"This film has always left me cold. Yes I do get it! No, I am no bored teenager with the attention span of a gnat.I am 59 and a lover of movies of all genres. When I first saw it I think I was too young to appreciate it and I have tried several times over the last few decades to see it with new eyes. However it just does not work for me. Peter Sellers is over used in this (and he is a favourite of mine) and it unbalances the whole thing. Slim Pickens and George C. Scott are great but cannot save this. Quite simply it bores me to tears, I find my mind wandering and am unable to enjoy it. I have seen most of Kubricks movies and find them cold and uninvolving with the exceptions of Spartacus(how much was him?) Paths of Glory and The Killing. Overrated is the term I would employ. I do think the cinematography is great and the sentiment of the whole thing is admirable. But as entertainment it falls down badly (and above all movies should be entertaining even when thought-provoking)."
mstomaso,"Mar 28, 2008",10/10,"Directed by Stanley Kubrick and written by the brilliant Terry Southern, Dr. Strangelove is a landmark film in many ways. While the film is normally classified as a dark comedy, it really consists of a hell of a lot of darkness made light of.There are plenty of great films which, in one way or another examine or evolve from the context of the cold war. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove is one of the best. A deranged paranoid General (Keenan Wynn) shuts down all communication at his base, orders his men to shoot at anything which attempts to approach the base and orders the dozens of B-52s under his command to drop nuclear bombs all over the Soviet Union. The rest of the film is mostly about how the United States' bumbling bureaucracy and megalomaniacal military attempt to 'contain the situation' while practicing the usual ass-covering.Sellers plays at least three disparate and challenging roles, and, not surprisingly, has most of the truly comedic scenes. George C. Scott and Keenan Wynn are frankly incredible as a couple of deranged generals respectively attempting to make the best of the situation and end the communist threat of fluoridated water. There are very few LOLs in this film. The humor is, in fact, somewhat uncomfortable most of the time, though it is definitely humor nonetheless. And yes, everything about this film is intentional and calculated.Stanley Kubrick used pacing in a somewhat unique way in many of his most well-known films. He sometimes created visual phrases with Shatner-like dramatic pauses attached to either end, and the result is always jarring and always disorienting - making the quotidian seem odd. Strangelove is the earliest Kubrick film I remember seeing this visual style in, but he took it to a new level in 2001 and Eyes Wide Shut. A Clockwork Orange exploits it as well. In Strangelove, he complements the alienating pacing with spectacular camera work and over-dramatic lighting. Visually superb film.Highly recommended."
adrian-43767,"Jun 10, 2018",10/10,"Director Stanley Kubrick made three films of absolute genius: PATHS OF GLORY (1957), DR STRANGELOVE (1963) and 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY (1968). The first two were on the subjects of war and treason, but while the former was extremely serious, DR STRANGELOVE is a dark comedy which tells many truths about the delicate balance of the nuclear bomb and peace, in contrast with FAILSAFE, a film which came out on the same year but which approached the subject of nuclear conflict from a much more factual and formal angle.I can safely say that DR STRANGELOVE made me far more aware of the world's perilous balance, because my guffaws at some of the film's funny lines caused my mind to imagine the real consequences much more realistically than the serious-minded FAILSAFE ever could. To that end. the acting was first class: Peter Sellers is very good as a feeble US president, a powerless British commander, and the mentally disturbed Dr Strangelove, who reminds me of Werner von Braun, with his SS past and trip to the Moon future. Sadly, Sellers gives Dr Strangelove a distracting Indian accent, otherwise he is a joy to watch. George C. Scott is marvelous as the US Armed Forces commander with side interests and an eye always firmly tracked on the military solution, conveying suspicions about the Ruskies and sending shivers down your spine with his mad eyes and his confidence in US military capacity; Keenan Wynn does well with a tiny part and his quip about Coca Cola Company's power is so outlandish that it is frightening; Peter Bull is superb as the Russian ambassador called to the War Room, who uses the opportunity to take spy shots; Slim Pickens, as commander of the aircraft which delivers the bomb, is memorable in his desire to serve his beloved country, to the extent of going down with the bomb; and Sterling Hayden is also at the top of his form as the base commander who loses his marbles and orders the air attack on Russia, and then takes the coward's way out.Great photography, special effects, fitting soundtrack, and fantastic dialogue, full of sharp one-liners, always pursuing the absurd and darkly comic angle, complete the bouquet. Masterpiece!PS: And so I learned not to worry... if not quite to love the bomb!"

Themes of nuclear Armageddon were quite popular, at least in my crowd, in those years.The last thing that I ever expected from the book was a comedy, albeit ""black"", If played straight it would have been another ""Fail-Safe"".In November of 1963 I was doing some routine comm maintenance at a Titan ll missile site in Kansas. Our comm team was getting ready to take our lunch break when the klaxon in the control center went off. Daily practice alerts were the norm so no one was alarmed until we tried to come up to the control center from the comm center (one floor below). The CO told us to get our asses below and stay out of the way. Thoughts of nuclear war and it's ramifications gripped us all. Our families in Wichita and no communications! About an hour later we were given the all clear. It was not until we got to our cars did we learn what happened that November day.Sometime later I learned that ""Red Alert"" was to be made into a movie. Since the USAF offered no assistance production went to England. I think there were several re-writes on the screen play before a comedy came to the forefront. I wonder if ""Fail-Safe"", which was released in the same time frame, may have helped determine the direction the movie was to take?""Alas, Babylon"", a nice little novel about the ""days after"" was a good read and would have made a nice little movie. Little would have been required of special effects since it's impact was more on the order of ""On The Beach""I realize that this is not a typical review. However, previous reviews said about all that could be said. I tried to add a little personal touch."
tomrito,"Aug 21, 2008",10/10,"This is without a doubt one of the greatest movies ever made. Stanley Kubrick has an insight into human behavior that no other person can match. Peter Sellers is beyond genius and George C. Scott and Slim Pickens fit right in with the rest of the cast to help produce the greatest satire ever made. This is the key to the greatness of the movie, it is not a just a comedy, it is a SATIRE, that is also very funny. If you understand the use of symbolism, irony, and ridicule to expose the folly of human behavior, you will get how wonderful and smart a film Mr. Kubrick has given us to enjoy.Anyway, I saw it again today and I have to say it is still one of my favorite movies and just great fun to watch. However, I do feel sorry for some of the people who are posting here that do not like the film. One person wrote; ""What the hell is this? Is it a comedy? It's not funny (at all). I did not even smile once, was I supposed to?"" Another wrote; ""real comedy to me is White Chicks and Nutty Professor.""I can only say that the movie is not intended to be a true comedy, it is a satire, in which human or individual vices, follies, abuses, or shortcomings are held up to censure by means of ridicule, derision, irony, or other methods, ideally with the intent to bring about improvement. Although satire is usually meant to be funny, the purpose of satire is not primarily humor in itself so much as an attack on something of which the author strongly disapproves, using the weapon of wit. Maybe, before you see this movie you should read something about the time it was made, about the cold war and the real fear people had about nuclear destruction. Or you can read the review posted here by tieman64 from United Kingdom"" called ""Ethnic cleansing, 26 July 2008"". It is a brilliant insight into what Mr. Kubrick was trying to achieve."
wal-btr,"Jul 29, 2017",N/A,"This wartime comedy is built on the contrast that rises from serious situations and absurd behavior - the US president small talking with the Soviet premier over an imminent airstrike, the sign that says ""Peace is our profession"" at the assaulted airbase, and many other details such as ""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room!"" The main characters are caricatured - Dr Strangelove is a physically diminished but brilliant former Nazi scientist, the anti-imperialist Soviet ambassador happens to be a spy as well, the US bomber pilot talks with a harsh Midwest accent and wears a cowboy hat. This coarse self-mockery is tempered by the sharp and exquisite dialogues of Peter Sellers who plays three roles - a phlegmatic British military, the US President and Dr Stangelove - and George Scott as a bold and gross American General."
oYSTERCHET,"May 2, 2007",6/10,"To call this movie a comedy. Is a mistake. Even the last comment giving this movie a 10 couldn't even call this movie comical. This movie failed to make me laugh. And i laugh at everything. But other than that this movie is pretty well done. Good cinematography. I guess. I didn't really notice because i was trying to hard to find a funny scene and everything was just kind of chuckle worthy MAYBE and then all of a sudden the movie was over.I know many of you will be screaming bloody murder at my claims. But seriously if this movie was showed to today's audience this movie would flop! Regardless of whether it was black and white or not. So i hate to be the voice of the stupid consumer but this movie just wasn't funny to me. And by all means you can debate this to death with each other and attempt and try to explain that the comedy is much more intelligent or character based or whatever, but in a society BUILT of oddballs and weird characters even Seller's over the top portrayal of common characters (President, Brit, Scientist) almost get lost in the wash of the kind of characters we have today: 40 year old virgins or Wrestling Monks included.Not to say that these movies are necessarily better. But i definitely laughed at these ones. And i believe as a stupid consumer i speak for most. This movie may deserve the small cult following it has... but greatest comedy of all time? Don't make me laugh!"
alexanderreznikov,"Jan 9, 2010",10/10,"""Dr. Strangelove..."" is such a unique movie for the 1960s. First, it was released in January of 1964. Second, the main subject of the movie is how to prevent a possible nuclear attack. Just less than two years prior to the release of this excellent movie, the Cuba missile crisis took place. Russia and the USA almost destroyed the world back then. OK, this was a very serious situation. But Stanley Kubrick did something unusual: he used a possibility of a nuclear attack and build a brilliant, smart, and very funny comedy on top of that. No details will be released in my review, but everybody should watch this movie. Yes, it was shot in 1964. Yes, it is white and black. But once you watch it, you gonna love it. Different critics and famous publications said that it is one of the funniest comedies ever made. I agree with them completely. 10 out 0f 10: excellent."
heracles74,"Sep 15, 2006",6/10,"Like many of Kubrick's movies, this movie is heavily overrated in my humble opinion (although I really like some of Kubrick's movies myself). I think that there are many Kubrick-fans out there who are enthusiastic about ALL of his movies and declare anything that he has made ""brilliant"", but quite frankly I didn't understand what's so funny about this movie. Maybe it's the kind of humor that I don't get, or maybe you have to place the movie in the time that it was made.The good thing about the movie however is that it's not a comedy like all the other comedies. If you're thinking about buying or renting it, expecting to laugh your way through this movie, then I wouldn't recommend you to buy (or rent) it.Kubrick was great in creating an uncomfortable, sinister atmosphere. It works out great in movies like The Shining and Full Metal Jacket, but in this movie it doesn't add anything to the humor in my opinion. It's hard to say if this movie should be considered as a comedy, a drama movie or a suspense thriller. I know that many people love it when you can't put a ""label"" on things, but this movie really misses focus. The actors in this movie are doing a good job and it is nicely filmed, but personally I wouldn't watch it for a second time."
Lejink,"Dec 15, 2018",5/10,"I came to ""Dr Strangelove"" after watching the alternative contemporary movie based on the same source novel, the super-serious ""Fail Safe"", which may have been a mistake on my part. It probably didn't help either that I've been lately tracking down and watching other Cold War political thrillers of the era. I think what I'm trying to say is that I didn't quite get Dr Strangelove, heretic as that may appear given its prestigious reputation.
I understand too that its anti-war message perhaps had more relevance and resonance to its original audience which had just gone through the whole Cuban Missile Crisis scenario, but for me the message here overcame the medium with Kubrick using a bazooka to crack open these particular nut(case)s.
I love Peter Sellers and of course he ably demonstrates his comic versatility and mastery of his craft over the course of the three roles he plays but just like Slim Pickens, George C Scott and Sterling Hayden his fellow-crazies, the characterisations used are just too broad, blunt and overpowering. I also found the running gags centring on sexual innuendo just too crude and obvious.
I do recognise that some of the scenes have become iconic like Pickens riding the missile down to destruction and Sellers gradually more deranged title character at the end plus I love the last line of the movie even if I suspect more of Sellers improvisatory skill than Kubrick's directorial hand in it.
However I can't escape my conclusion that the movie seems overrated and more of a museum piece at least to my eyes."
Arangalad,"Jan 10, 2002",10/10,"I first saw this movie a little over three years ago, when I was on a trip to Australia. I was very eager to get my hands of the Stanley Kubrick Collection, which by then was just released. The first one I watched was Dr. Strangelove. Never before had I even heard of this picture, yet it surpassed everything I had ever seen before. Do not miss this movie.I like everything about this movie. Peter Sellers, Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott are all supreme actors and do excellent performances. The story and the script are wonderful. And what can go wrong with Stanley Kubrick as director? Nothing. Yet I am surprised. Considering how amazing everyone who has seen this movie thinks it is (everyone I've talked to), there are a lot of people who haven't even heard of it. Do not miss this movie.I must admit I haven't counted: but I must've seen this movie around ten times, and I still find it amazing. In my world, this is the no.1 movie of all times. A crystal clear 10/10. Oh, and DO NOT miss this movie."
WriterDave,"Dec 29, 2005",10/10,"Just about everything in this brilliant satire of Cold War politics is perfect. Kubrick created his first template masterpiece with this hilarious comedy that sees military bureaucracy as a comedy of errors and a hot-line conversation between the President of the US and the Premier of the USSR as a snippy fit between quasi-lovers. You have everything you could ever want here: great dialogue, fantastic acting, flawless directing, cool sets, and timely political farce (that could still ring true today in this age of Bush America, Institutionalized Fear, and the War on Terror).Everyone deservedly raves about Peter Sellers in his multiple roles (as Mandrake, the President, and Dr. Strangelove), but I dare you to find a funnier performance than that of George C. Scott as the slapdash over-zealous General ""Buck"" Turgidson, especially when he falls over backwards in the War Room and gets up and continues his speech without missing a beat. Also of note is Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper. His riffs on the purity of essence, bodily fluids, and Communist infiltration through fluoridation are laugh-out-loud funny. With characters like Colonel ""Bat"" Guano, and Slim Pickens' Major Kong, great scenes naturally flow forth, and Kubrick's one take on pure comedy is simply genius. He was wise never to touch the genre again fully (although ""A Clockwork Orange"" will always be a comedy in my book), as he made the perfect example of the form here."
Kirpianuscus,"Jan 25, 2020",N/A,"""Fantastic"" is the fair word to define this black satire in which the genius of Stanley Kubrick is completed by the great job of Peter Sellers. A warning, more convincing for humor, a hypotesis not so unrealistic and a brilliant George C. Scott."
uygaronan,"Dec 10, 2005",6/10,"This movie is a good directed and performed movie ... That's OK. No words to say.. However, I can't understand how this movie got this rating. It's funny but not that much.. The sound during almost entire movie is really annoying, there are not that much funny scenes and not that much jokes. Most part of movie is far from being hilarious and funny,on the other hand it's really a good sample of cult. I think, it's not a good comedy and it was really surprising for me to see this movie on the first place in comedy genre. Nevertheless these never change the fact that Kubrick is a genius director and it's really a good cult movie but I should say that the movie didn't impress me much and not the best movie of Kubrick. I think this movie doesn't deserve this rating."
lastliberal,"Jun 9, 2007",10/10,"I am amazed that I had not seen this Stanley Kubrick classic before yesterday. I may not have appreciated it before, but it certainly is one of the best comedies ever produced. Even the title ranks among the funniest ever written.Beside the outstanding film Stanley Kubrick (2001: A Space Odyssey, A Clockwork Orange, Full Metal Jacket) has written and directed, there are stars that shine brightly throughout.Peter Sellers (Being There, The Pink Panther) was nominated for another Oscar for playing three roles in this film. He was just outstanding. George C. Scott (Patton) was over the top as Gen. 'Buck' Turgidson. Sterling Hayden, Keenan Wynn, and Slim Pickens all turned in outstanding performances. Who will forget that final ride that Pickens made. Yee Haw! This is the definitive film showing just how ridiculous the cold warriors were. A must see."
Shortee16,"Mar 12, 2004",6/10,"Dr. Strangelove shows an interesting strategy to make a prophetic hypothesis' of the rate that intra-countries competitions could become. Its original purpose was hard to grasp, yet this same confusion backs up the purpose trying to be shown. That the subconscious or even conscious reason for the existence of the competition of creating bombs more powerful than someone else's, is lost in the midst of so much politics. A comical example of this is the delivered line which prohibits the fighting in the war room. The way in which politics and international relations were represented was comically put. During a conversation between the Russian and American president, had the audience been ignorant of the speakers identities, an assumption could have been made that it was a conversation between husband and wife feuding. Dr. Strangelove is known for its immense amount of froid content, all throughout the film many references to this subject are portrayed by the dialogue of the actors and even minor things like the smoking of varied sized cigars. The purpose and manner in which this film portrayed its message was both subtle and bold. Even though at times lengthy and seemingly pointless dialogues were present, along with an excessive amount of sexual references, it was understood that this excess was what was desired and necessary to bring across its comical message of `international bomb envy.'"
grim_angel,"Feb 8, 2000",2/10,"I must confess that I love the work of Peter Sellers and admire most of Stanley Kubrik's library, but what the heck were they thinking?  Satire works if it's funny; this movie is simply boring.  The entire time I spent watching this film I wondered why I had anticipated it so much."
Pedro_H,"Sep 27, 2002",10/10,"A mad American general (Sterling Haydon) orders an nuclear attack on Russia that the rest of the US military machine finds hard to overturn.A film that has three major ""The's"": The best regarded cold war film, the film that crowned director Kubrick as a genius, and the role(s) that made Peter Sellers the comic actor of the 60's. Today the cold war is dead - as is Kubrick, Sellers and Haydon - but this film's skill and brilliance lives on.Only Kubrick could have chosen to make a comedy film that used such a harsh backdrop as the very future of the world. This makes the film even better - counterbalancing the ultra dark nature of the film. Thankfully he did not end the film with a food fight as he originally planned.(That explains the long table in the war room. In reality no food or drink is allowed in war room locations in case it is spilled in to the sensitive equipment.)Strangely a more straight version of the ""ultimate nightmare"" Fail-safe (1964) is generally forgotten, although it is, perhaps, better plotted and more true-to-life.Kubrick's admiration for Sellers allowed him to be cast in four roles (he only played three in the end): An RAF officer, the US President, the mad German scientist (Strangelove) and one of  the bomber pilots. He dropped out of the last role, mostly because he feared one of the stunts -  that could not have been doubled - that features at the end of the picture.(A picture - with Sellers dressed in pilots uniform - is still in circulation suggesting that filming of him in the role had even started. Replacement Slim Pickins was, allegedly, not told that it was a comedy, although it is hard to say this effected an actor not noted for his variety of delivery.)Seller's position in these three roles saved quite a bit of money on a film that required elaborate sets (that suffered from constant overheating). The film was only a modestly budgeted affair and therefore didn't feature Kubrick's over-the-top perfectionism that often grinds the actors to dust. At one stage George C. Scott falls over (clearly from losing grip on a shinny floor rather than a stunt) and the accident was left in. On the Shining (1980) Kubrick wanted 50 takes to get a door slam right!Despite having three shots at the prize Sellers doesn't come out of the film with the best comedy performance award. That goes to the constantly under-rated Sterling Haydon as the mad general who believes that fluoride in the water is responsible the world's plight!Dr Strangelove is in every way a classic and has another small footnote in history: It was Elvis Presley's  favourite film. According to friends he watched the film 40 to 50 times and would repeat the dialogue in time with the actors..."
MaxBorg89,"Jul 23, 2007",10/10,"The best satires are those that, while related to a specific period, may be applied to the modern days as well. One such film is The Great Dictator, which was explicitly aimed at Hitler but also works as a mockery of every kind of dictatorship; another example is Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove, a cold-war satire which has lost none of its power considering nuclear weapons still exist and, albeit less than in the past, constitute a threat to the planet's safety.Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (one of the longest titles in history, but also one of the most poignant) is set in a dystopic reality where the conflict between USA and Soviet Union has reached disastrous proportions, leading the mad Gen. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) to believe the Russians have poisoned the American soldiers'water supplies, contaminating their ""bodily fluids"" as he puts it, and orders an irrevocable attack on Sovietic soil: a series of nuclear devices will be dropped on the enemy's territory unless someone convinces Ripper of the insanity of his actions. This task is appointed to Capt. Mandrake (Peter Sellers), who desperately tries to reach President Merkin Muffley (Sellers again) while trying to persuade the crazy general to end the nonsense he has started. Muffley, in the meantime, having learned of the situation, attempts to have a peaceful conversation with his Russian counterpart (""Well, Dimitri, one of our base commanders, he had a sort of... well, he went a little funny in the head... you know... just a little... funny"") while his advisers, Gen. Turgidson (George C. Scott) and the titular scientist (still Sellers), think of what to do to keep humanity alive, given the Bomb on hostile soil will trigger a device called the Doomsday Machine (the name says it all).The genius of Kubrick's masterpiece derives from the exaggeration of typically clichéd elements of other war movies: the officers' incompetence, the paranoid atmosphere, the soldiers' selfless bravery et al. All of these, especially the last one, flawlessly depicted by Texan Maj. ""King"" Kong (Slim Pickens in what was meant to be Sellers' fourth role), are funny because, although overblown, they look real thanks to each character's seriousness and commitment to the job. All the physical comedy performed by Gen. Turgidson would have looked silly if he were played by the wrong actor, but Scott manages to make even the most ridiculous gesture an organic, necessary part of his role. The same goes for Hayden: what could easily have been a low-quality parody of war-related madness becomes in his hands a realistic depiction of paranoia and (extreme) patriotism.Neither of them, however, can match the brilliance and versatility of Sellers' triple act: the first (and one of the few) to get an Oscar nomination (Best Actor, more precisely) for playing multiple characters in the same movie, he successfully moves from pure slapstick (Strangelove) to typically British anxiety (Mandrake) and deadpan delivery (Muffley) without breaking a single sweat. Whether he is politely arguing with Hayden, discussing authority with Scott or struggling with his Nazi arm (one of cinema's most iconic images), he understands what will work in the right moment and shamelessly steals the whole picture. Without him, the film would not have been half as good as it is to this day, and that should be enough testament to his status as one of the greatest comedians of the 20th century.In short, a must-see comedy and essential viewing for fans of either Kubrick or Sellers. Hell, it's so good it even makes the expression ""Mein Fuhrer"" raise laughs rather than cries of disgust."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Feb 22, 2008",10/10,"Dr. Strangelove is widely considered to be one of Stanley Kubrick's best films, if not THE best, and it's easy to see why. I remember watching it several years ago and not really getting into it, but as I rewatched it a couple nights ago I realized quickly what I had missed back then. It is a remarkably simple film, an actor's film, obviously, but the crackling dialogue and the stunning performances (most notably from Peter Sellers and George C. Scott, of course), are what really make the movie work so well.That is, of course, a pretty powerful statement, to give so much credit to the actors, since the story itself is a compellingly realistic and plausible what-if tale that was released to the public in an atmosphere of frightening tension between the U.S. and Russia. So realistic, in fact, that they felt it necessary to including a disclaimer at the beginning of the film, in which the Air Force would like to assure the public that it has systems in place which would prevent such a thing from ever happening.The film begins with something that was news to me, that America kept a given number of B-52 bombers airborne 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, in the event that their destructive services might be suddenly needed, which itself is a sign of what the times were like back then.The story concerns a General who loses his mind and orders all airborne bombers to attack Russia, unprovoked. The men on board the planes are dumbstruck, of course, because they realize the meaning of this order. A brilliant Slim Pickens is in charge on board one of the planes, and there is a rumor that during the performance, he wasn't told that the film was a comedy, which may be one of the reasons his comic performance is so brilliant, because this is exactly the kind of comedy that Kubrick loves and excels with. As Roger Ebert once noted, a man wearing a funny hat is not funny. But a man who doesn't KNOW he's wearing a funny hat...I have three favorite interactions in the film. The first is the isolated interaction between the crazy general and one of Sellers' performances, Colonel Mandrake, who is stuck with the general and forced to listen with increasing agitation and disbelief to the general's explanations for why it is so imperative to strike the Russians immediately (""A foreign substance is introduced into our precious bodily fluids without the knowledge of the individual!""). This is funny to me because I have a close friend who's wife is absolutely convinced that the American government is doing this to its own citizens right now as I write this, in early 2008. She should watch this film.The second performance I love is Sellers' portrayal of Dr. Strangelove, although I'll admit that I remain a little confused as to why the film ended with his sudden exclamation that he can walk. I know there is something going on there that I'm missing but I just can't think of it. And last but not least, George C. Scott as the fanatical General Buck Turgidson. Scott's performance is so brilliant and in such deep detail that it's impossible to see it all in one viewing. I rewound all of his scenes two or three times and there is always something new. I think his might be the best performance in the movie.Watch, of course, for a young James Earl Jones on board the airplane, and of course Pickens' exit from the airplane and the movie, which is one of the most famous moments in film history.And of course, since in China I especially appreciated this - listen for Mandrake's hilarious comment about his experience being tortured by the Japanese! Only Peter Sellers could make something as real and disturbing as Japanese torture this funny!"
campbell-russell-a,"Apr 19, 2014",10/10,"This is without doubt one of the best films ever made. Its greatness can be gauged by the fact that it has never lost its punch even though it is set at the height of the Cold War. What keeps it so fresh?Firstly, there is the performances of everyone in the cast. Sellers is astonishing and the rest of the cast also seems to have been inspired by the prospect of creating a masterpiece. George C. Scott was reportedly angry with Kubrick because he used Scott's over-the-top takes rather than his straighter ones but I think Stanley's instincts and understanding of the overall dynamics of the film led him to make the right decision. Scott's performance as the highly dangerous buffoon, Buck Turgidson, is unforgettable. Turgidson was apparently based upon a U.S. Air Force colonel, Curtis Lemay, and is a comment upon people who decide the fate of millions by relying on statistics. Slim Pickens replaced Sellers as Major Kong and this is indicative of how circumstances beyond even the control of the director can capture lightning in a bottle. Sellers had not relished playing the fourth role of Kong possibly because it required a Texan accent. After Sellers broke his leg after falling from the bomb, Kubrick sent for Pickens because he needed a real life Texan not just an actor who could pretend to be one. Pickens rides the bomb to its target like a rodeo rider whooping and waving his cowboy hat as only he could do it. He is the embodiment of a generation of ""cowboy"" generals and politicians and no doubt a percentage of the general public who seemingly relished the thought of ending the world in an orgasm of dimwitted enthusiasm for destruction of Ruskies and evil empires.Perhaps what makes Dr. Strangelove most memorable and enduring is Ken Adam's sets – in particular, the war room. Adam was master of producing slightly ahead of their time sets and ones that isolated the subjects. They were little worlds which distanced their occupants and the audience from the rest of the world. Under the huge ring/dome of light the generals play a game of poker with the world at stake.I would suggest that it is the script, written or improvised, that keeps people coming back to this film. The one line that jars with me is the one most people like to quote: ""You can't fight in here; this is the war room."" I find it the one obvious gag line in a film that never relies on gags. It relies upon most of the characters delivering the lines with a deep sense of belief. It is Major Kong's sense of duty and destiny that makes his line ""this is it; nuclear combat, toe to toe with the Ruskies"" at once funny and frightening. It is the mentality of those involved that needed to be seen in the light of comedy in order to see the enormity of the danger. It is this fine balance of dark comedy that is struck and maintained with no let up that is at the core of this masterpiece."
talexander12599,"Sep 4, 2015",9/10,"Dr Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (I'll refer to it as Dr. Strangelove after this) is a political dark comedy directed by Stanley Kubrick (Clockwork Orange, The Shining, 2001: A Space Odyssey) and was written by he and Terry Southern (Easy Rider, Barbarella, The Cincinnati Kid) and Peter George (Fail Safe) from 1964. It stars Peter Sellers (Being There, The Pink Pather, The Pink Panther Strikes Again), George C. Scott (Patton, The Hustler, The Changeling) and Sterling Haden (The Godfather, The Killing, Asphalt Jungle)Dr. Strangelove is about a mad general (Sterling Haden) who begins the start of a nuclear war against Russia and the president of the United States (Peter Sellers) and his right-hand man (George C. Scott) and a lot of other politicians, including Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), who try to stop it.There are so many aspects of this movie that are great including the acting and writing, but I will talk about a man who does not receive enough recognition for his incredible work despite his two Oscars, this man is Ken Adam (Barry Lyndon, Goldfinger, Dr. No). Ken Adam did production design for Dr. Strangelove and he creates one of the best sets of all time in this film, and that is the war room. This set is enormous yet it is barely filled. It creates a powerful feel while being so simple. This set is so real that people thought it was an actual location and Ronald Reagen even thought it was real! When you watch this film you are in awe when you see the places they shoot. It is simply magical.How can you watch a Kubrick film without admiring the directing? Kubrick takes a quite serious novel and subject and successfully makes it a comedy. Who would have thought in 1964 you could've made a comedy about the end of the world through nuclear holocaust? Kubrick saw this risk and took it. He does some interesting camera work that looks like it inspired Spielberg while making Saving Private Ryan. Anyway, he does a great job directing his actors especially Scott and will be looked at as one of his best films.There is not much I can see wrong with this movie. It is hilarious yet portrays a serious lesson. This is probably one of the greatest dark comedies and comedies in general ever created."
rogierr,"Jul 3, 2001",N/A,"The best cold-war film there is.  It's a hilarious nightmare about the escalating arms race (and its consequences), in which Peter Sellers is obviously brilliant and George C. Scott is hilariously funny.  Is it a coincidence that the book 'Red Alert' was written by Peter George? (could it have been Scott Sellers who wrote it?) Also, this is the best performance by Sterling Hayden (Asphalt Jungle, The Killing) I've seen so far.  He has to be one of my favourite villains ever.I saw this film by accident at 2 a.m. on my own and I couldn't control my (hilarious) emotions and imagination, so I probably woke up some neighbours by laughing.  I simply watched it in one breath and dreamed about mushrooms. Those where black dreams about black sheep I assure you!BTW 'Two hours to doom' doesn't apply completely to this satire, because the film unfortunately only takes 93 minutes, but those were the best spent 93 minutes of my life. The cinematographer Gilbert Taylor (Repulsion, Star Wars) and ofcourse Kubrick make it possible to watch this film again immediately after you saw it, simply to see the whole thing start and escalate again.Why o why can't we vote 11  :("
occjph,"Sep 19, 2004",10/10,"It's sad to see so many people post negative comments about this great film.They hear it's a 'great comedy', watch it, and fail to see clowns, bright colors and hijinks. One person even complained it was not like a Mel Brooks film! May I suggest Austin Powers films for that person?Folks, it's a BLACK COMEDY. That does not equate to slapstick. It's a -bit- more intellectual than that. The best black comedies contain material that is at once both comedic and horrific. And -every- 'joke' in this film contains a huge dollop of horror. Riding a bomb down to the ultimate explosion, declaring 'Gentlemen, there's no fighting here, it's the War Room!', discussion of the ratio of sexually stimulating females to males in coal mines, etc. All of these references are made in the spirit of black comedy - funny, yet horrifying and tragic. Even the alternative title 'How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb' is based on the terrible worry most people had about atomic war in the 60's. Kubrick knew this and played with it, and did it better than most.As to the films impact, consider this: Every new US president since this film have asked to see the 'war room' soon after the inaugural festivities were over. There -is- no 'war room'. Kubrick/Terry Southern invented it. Sure, there is a 'situation room' at the Whitehouse, but no grand war room as seen in the film. No one can forget the 'war room' of Dr. Strangelove after seeing the film.In typical Kubrick fashion, the details of this film are overwhelming. The B-52 that Kong flew was still very much classified in 1964. Kubrick hired the best avionics experts to design what they thought would be a nice replica of a strategic bomber, filled with hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of control panels and real avionics devices. It was so real that Kubrick and Columbia had talks with the FBI about the release of the film. It was just a bit TOO accurate for the intel folks. Kubrick, Southern and Wally Veevers were determined to create a film that was as accurate as possible. 2001 continued this Kubrick tradition, with excessive attention to detail in every possible way.So, if you are looking for slapstick comedy mayhem and hijinks, try another film. This film was intended for adults seriously worried about the possibility that the world would be incinerated in an accidental war, in a world run by kooks and ideologues. Black comedy allows us to look at a terrifying subject without leaving the theater in a total funk. If you want a film about this subject with no black comedy, try Fail Safe, a film that premiered at about the same time. It's a great film, but lacks the charm of Kubrick and Terry Southern."
lifchez,"May 15, 2001",2/10,"I'm sorry but I found more to laugh at watching Battlefield Earth!!! This movie was just NOT FUNNY. Seeing it ranked so high on the ""100 funniest movies"" list, my wife and I figured it must be a Peter Sellers laugh-fest. Imagine our disappointment when we discovered we couldn't have been more wrong. 45 minutes into the movie, we literally looked at each other and said ""this is a comedy, right?"" 15 minutes later I fell asleep (that shows how boring the movie was) so it wasn't until the next day that I finally found 2 things to laugh at:1) The scene with Sellers looking for spare change and the subsequent shooting of the Coca-Cola machine.2) The bit with Dr. Strangelove referring to the president as ""Der Fuehrer"" and his hand continually attempting to raise in the style of a nazi salute.Those of you who have seen this movie know what I'm referring to. Those who have not... I would not advise spending an hour and a half to see these two gags.Seeing this movie has verified my serious doubts about the list of the so-called ""100 funniest movies."" Do yourself a favor... if you want to see a good comedy, ask a trusted friend to recommend a good one."
Hannibal_Chigurh,"Oct 28, 2007",10/10,"Dr. Strangelove came at a time when the Cold War came closest to turning hot. Both the United States and the USSR kept building more and more missiles in case of attack. Stanley Kubrick wanted to make a film pointing out the insanity of the Cold War. While adapting the novel Red Alert, he realized the best way to do so was to make a comedy out of it. Stanley drafted satirist Terry Southern to help turn the thriller into a black comedy. What resulted was the greatest piece of satire ever put to film.As if Terry Southern wasn't enough, Kubrick managed to secure Peter Sellers, the most talented and versatile comedic actor since Charlie Chaplin and perhaps ever. Sellers played three roles (it would have been four if he hadn't broken his leg trying to play Major Kong): the RAF officer Lionel Mandrake, US President Merkin Muffley, and the mad German-born scientist Dr. Strangelove.The film begins with General Jack D. Ripper (see if you can spot that joke), played by Sterling Hayden, sending the planes under his command to nuke their designated targets in Russia. He can do so thanks to a provision that allows officers to ordering nuclear bombings instead of relying on the president. Meanwhile the President meets with chiefs of staff in the War Room to countermand the order. The only general who really speaks is Air Force General Turgidson, played masterfully by George C. Scott. The only downside of having Peter Sellers in the movie is that Scott's work goes often unappreciated. His facial and body language is so animated, hilarious and perfect that I devoted three viewings to focusing on it.The film adds a third setting: one of the bombers sent into Russia. The captain of the plane is Major Kong, portrayed by Slim Pickens, who filled in when Sellers couldn't pull it off. To my knowledge Kubrick never told Slim it was a comedy, so he plays the straightest role in the film. The film constantly switches from the plane, the War Room, and Ripper's base, which is under fire from US troops trying to arrest Ripper.While the film has only a few quotable lines (chief of which being ""You can't fight in here, this is the War Room), every scene has something, either spoken or visual, that gets laughs. As Us troops fire upon fellow soldiers at Ripper's base, a giant sign that say ""Peace Is Our Profession"" stands behind the action. When the president brings the Russian ambassador into the War Room early on, it sparks many gems (including the aforementioned quote). He also sets up the phone conversation between the president and the premier of Russia, which is one of the funniest phone calls ever put to film. Taken out of context, none of it is amusing, yet when presented against the backdrop of the threat of nuclear holocaust, the trivialities and pleasantries are hysterical.While Mandrake and the president have more lines, the best character Sellers portrays is Dr. Strangelove, a former Nazi scientist who has since become an American citizen and a weapons researcher for the US. Sellers' mannerisms and inflections will have you gasping for air.Dr. Strangelove does retain the thriller aspect of the film's original intent. However, as the comedy darkens one can predict the outcome of the film. People call this Kubrick's only comedy, but I think that's not true. Stanley applied this kind of dark, vicious humor to nearly every film he made after that. Full Metal Jacket is loaded with it. A Clockwork Orange in a sense is a dark comedy, only one that deals with crime, punishment, and the government's symbiotic and mutually parasitic relationship with the media. Dr. Strangelove remains his pure comedy, though, and like all Kubrick films, pushed the genre it was made in to new heights. This was my first Kubrick film and I immediately became a fanboy after it. This remains my second favorite film behind Apocalypse Now. It's still just as relevant today as it was back then, and it's also just as funny."
talisencrw,"Aug 23, 2016",10/10,"Kubrick is such a remarkable director that only he could make a movie so revolutionarily hilarious about the Cold War and yet it's so difficult to even place it in my Top 5 of his works (and yes, his next film, '2001: A Space Odyssey' would be my favourite movie ever made), though for Peter Sellers, a rare actor whom Kubrick would work with more than once, this would have to be up there with 'Being There' and 'The Party' in terms of my favourite works of his.Slim Pickens often noted that this film established his career. Unfortunately, many so-called film aficionados of today won't bother either with black-and-white movies or films made before 1970, which is a shame, because this is clearly a wonderful work that more people today should see.Do yourself a favour and watch it if you haven't already done so. Since 9/11 I always wonder if something of this ilk could, in this era of political correctedness, ever be made about the present state of things."
godfreecharlie,"Sep 17, 2020",9/10,"Nuclear war is a deadly serious game. Near total lethality. Man made cosmic catastrophe. Worse than a cosmic apocalypse; the event that keeps on giving long after everyone is gone.
Kubrik eased the tension with his take on senseless annihilation, using realistic scenarios that most Americans would recognize thru the many PSAs and newsreel boasts of American prowess. The characters K cast were spot on, giving a comfortable realism that didn't cause consternation, wondering why so and so was chosen etc. Whether so and so was the first choice is no issue here, his final decision was the right one.
All that rolled up with the plot made for a film that is so much more in a multitude of ways. Viewing Strangelove at least 2, no, 3 times is my recommendation. Sellers' dominance is not in the least bit distracting. He was a master of his profession. The other cast members are made for their parts.
This honesty is what keeps one thinking ""what if this really happened?"" all the while laughing incessantly at the absurdity.
Damn, Stanley you have left a lasting impression on my worldview."
Moshe Kam,"Nov 30, 2002",N/A,"I fail to see the greatness of ""Dr. Strangelove"".  The movie was certainly timely.  It addressed, through somewhat off-center humor, a very serious and pervasive fear that the West has harbored in the 1950s and 1960s.  However, the execution here is crude beyond belief.  The tastelessness starts with the ""symbolic"" names, from the mad general ""Jack D. Ripper"", to the Soviet Prime Minister ""Kiss-off"".  It continues with a large number of rather gross jokes, some plain silly (the nuclear war starts, and the B52 pilot suggests that his crew is to enjoy some ""very serious promotions"" once this war of annihilation is over), most laced with infantile sexual innuendo.Especially grotesque are the scenes with the German Nazi advisor, Dr. Strangelove (""He changed his name; it was originally Merkwurdigliebe""). Yes, I know all about Wernher von Braun, but this series of Aryan slogans and Nazi salutes, again steeped in infantile sexual ""humor"", was just plain silly.So there are a few good lines executed quite well by George C. Scott, and the scene that has our pilot hero, Major T.J. ""King"" Kong, ride on the nuclear bomb on its way to the target is amusing.  Overall, not too much."
roderriusswann,"Nov 14, 2023",7/10,"This was an interesting movie to say the least. My favorite part of this movie, was towards the end of the movie. I found the man on the bomb that was dropping kinda funny and weird. Bro knew he was about to die, yet he went out screaming and yelling happily ever after. I liked how the man at the end finally stood up, that was truly amazing. I would recommend this film to people from the age 14 and up. Although this was a weird movie, I truly enjoyed this and would watch another film by Stanley Kubrick. The ending of this movie proved to me that if you actually try, you will achieve your goal."
crumjimmy87,"Mar 18, 2012",1/10,"I don't know if I'm just to young and didn't understand the movie,but I've seen a lot of older movies and a lot of comedies and I didn't get this one.First Its not funny I didn't laugh one time not even a smile.I like Kubrick I think he has made some great movies but this one I don't understand how it has a high rating and in the top 250.To me one of the worst movies I have every seen don't understand how it as a movie got a Oscar nod for best picture.Just my opinion not a critic not movie buff but I have seen good movies and this isn't one of them.I have to make 10 lines so I'm going to say again that this movie was awful and I'm not good at writing things but I just felt a need to write a review on this movie because it is classified as one of the greatest movies of all time and Its not. maybe for people that lived though the cold war and missile crisis era but I went to school and learn about all that and it still wasn't good."
estebangonzalez10,"Oct 23, 2015",9/10,"""Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room.""This is only my third Stanley Kubrick film, but so far it's my favorite. I can't imagine how funny this film must have been when it came out in the mid 60's during the height of the Cold War, because more than 50 years later this black and white comedy continues to resonate in today's modern political world. It's sharp, it's smart, it's dark, but above all it's funny. It seems after so many decades that we haven't learned a thing about the sharp ironies presented here through each character and situation because the story continues to be relatable. The script is hilarious and the delivery from each actor is perfect, with several characters standing out. Peter Sellers does an amazing job playing three very different characters, but I was especially a fan of George C. Scott's portrayal of Gen. Buck. The scenes in the War Room were by far my favorite in the movie, but almost everything worked to perfection in this sharp and tightly written satire. The effects are a bit over the top but I think it simply adds to the overall craziness of the movie. I know I still have a lot of catching up with Kubrick films, but I don't see how his other films will top this one, at least entertaining wise. Satires can become a bit heavy handed after its initial first half, but this film maintains the laughs throughout its entire runtime. I'm surprised that I found this political comedy hilarious considering I'm not into politics at all, but I found it impossible not to watch it with a smile on my face. Is there a better political satire than Dr. Strangelove? I doubt it or at least I haven't come across one yet. What makes this film so relevant is that we are laughing at a nuclear threat in a time when the fear was very eminent.In the opening scenes we are introduced to General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden), who is giving his pilots secret orders to bomb the Soviet Union. Jack has gone mad and is overstepping his authority after discovering a loophole which allows him to order the attack without having to ask for permission from the US government. He has cut off all communication with the pilots so no one can stop his insane plan. Jack is convinced the communists are poisoning the world and he must stop them. When the President, Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) is informed of the General's plan he immediately calls his advisers to the War Room in order to try to put an end to Jack's madness. His adviser, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), informs the President how Jack was able to overstep his authority and in a hilarious scene through the big board shows the location of every plane as they are approaching the Soviet Union. Against Buck's advice, the President decides to invite Russian Ambassador Alexei de Sadeski (Peter Bull) to the War Room in order to discuss what is happening and to prove he isn't responsible for the attacks. Among the men in the room there is also Dr. Strangelove (Peter Sellers), a former Nazi scientist who is a specialist when it comes to nuclear weapons. The interactions between these characters and their efforts to stop Jack's plan in order to avoid the world's annihilation becomes the focal point of the film.Peter Sellers delivers outstanding work here playing the President, Dr. Strangelove, and Lionel Mandrake, who is Jack's right hand man and the only one who thinks he can stop him from executing his plan. He delivers three very distinctive characters and I honestly didn't recognize it was the same actor. George C. Scott is the standout however in his overly dramatic and serious delivery. His character was the one I laughed the most at. The things he says in such a serious tone are absolutely hilarious. I don't know how much of the lines were improvised or how much of it was actually scripted from Peter George's book, Red Alert, but all I can say is that every line was executed perfectly by these actors. This is one of those films that has transcended its time and continues to make audiences laugh around the globe.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
huguesboisvert747,"Aug 4, 2008",9/10,"Dr. Strangelove is one of the rare movies that are so well done that they become great movies despite their astonishing simplicity. A simplicity that reveals by the same time a subtle complexity. The movie, part of Stanley Kubrick's most remarkable work, is gorgeous by the intelligence of the direction, the scenario and the cast.Stanley Kubrick had just begin his career of director/producer in the industry when he did Dr. Strangelove and, even if he was young at the time, we can feel the incredible genius of the director by the way he conducts the story along the movie. The shots and especially the lightnings make the scenes of that picture unforgettable and rich of quality.The tale is pretty simple, it turns around the situation of an unwanted nuclear attack of the USA in USSR. A situation pretty funny but that was realistic in those years and this is what make the movie so blackly funny. Many sides of the situation are shown with different settings and characters which is brilliant. Globally, the scenario is gorgeous, a so intelligent tale despite as it been said it's simplicity and subtlety.One of the major remarkable points about that film is the performance of the actors, all of them are astonishing including of course Peter Sellers, who is playing for me the greatest performance(s)of his whole career. James C. Scott and Sterling Hayden are also leading well played roles and are both wonderful.Dr. Strangelove is a movie that looks to get better by each passing year and, more than 40 years after it's release, we can still laugh and admire that wonderful movie that won't take a ride for the next hundred years. It is truly a universal masterpiece of cinema, and arguably one of the better movies of the cinema history."
BoSIzAlive,"Dec 23, 2015",10/10,"The point i accepted this movie as one of my all time favourites, was not the climax or the part when George C. Scott amazes us by his acting skills in the war room. The tiny Minny details that is explained about the altitude the plane fly and how the bombing is going to take place,and after it got hit the way the pilot and soldier respond to it, made me think how the director is seeing this movie. He makes us see the movie in the exact way the movie was made for. Something worth to learn for other directors out there.More than Peter Sellers it was George C. Scott whose acting carried the movie from the second half. A good movie to watch, excellent music, direction and script is outstanding. Watch this without getting distracted in between by friends or family, because the feel of the movie lies in the tiny details of the middle part of the movie."
PaulB65,"Jan 3, 2025",N/A,"""After"" 2001 A Space Odyssey, Dr Strangelove is a second unique work by Kubrick.There is like a link between the two films, and chronologically, they are not in the right order :). In Dr Strangelove (1964), Kubrick gave an answer to 2001 A Space Odyssey (1968): the extinction of human civilization by his own and unique hand, faster than we think. But we can also see 2001 a Space Odyssey as a zoom out of Dr Strangelove in space-time...Dr Strangelove, unlike other Kubrick films, has a damaging weakness: lengths that seem avoidable to me, in the exterior scenes which are the attack on the military base, but especially the follow-up of the flight of the lost bomber. The film lasts 95 minutes, and we can think that this short duration pushed Kubrick to a generous and ""inclusive"" editing, dressing the few key scenes of the film.In any case, it remains nonetheless a jubilant film by the dialogues and performances of Peter Sellers, but also that of Georges Scott. In this regard, the scene where he appears for the first time is in itself a little gem, with the theatrical opposition of ""Miss Scott"" (played by Tracy Reed) young girl with smooth skin, suave and measured voice, and Georges Scott almost redneck in his hoarse accent and his beach shorts.This opposition of verbal style will be reused (we imagine without hearing the Soviet president) during the telephone communication between the American and Soviet presidents.Jubilant ! This phone conversation, the stupidity of the Russian ambassador and George Scott in their confrontation, and of course the whole scene of Dr. Stangelove in his wheelchair.And the ending song, ""We'll Meet Again"" is a scene from the film, just like the one of Peter Sellers in his wheelchair.One last point that concerns Kubrick's films (a majority at least) : the place of women. They are either absent (or secondary roles), or at the service of men to satisfy their libido (Lolita, Clockwork Orange, and apparently Eyes Wide Shut which I haven't seen). Barry Lyndon is an exception. As for The Shining, whatever one might think, Shelley Duvall has a secondary role and is essential to the story (as Danny's mother). Dr. Strangelove drives the point home with his theory of women selected to revive human demography...."
thomas-hardcastle-2,"Jan 4, 2009",7/10,"Of all the Kubrick films I have seen, this is by far the funniest, although it was never the initial intention of the director to make it so, the preposterous nature of events contained within the script led it to be altered to a dark comedy after work had begun.In saying this, however, the film is not an out-and-out comedy. The subject matter would not allow it to be so. If anything, it is a very dark comedy.The events may be serious, but the characters who create the tensions and events vary in hilarity. Peter Sellers plays three of the characters exceptionally well. His comic timing and ability to ad lib help create a bizarre atmosphere and ultimately a classic film, devoid of too much seriousness.This is not in any way Stanley Kubrick's masterpiece, but it is definitely a memorable piece, with memorable performances and a unique slant on the events leading to nuclear warfare."

I must have laughed at most twice during the entire film!  I've been repeatedly disappointed with Kubrick's films, but somehow had higher hopes for this one.  All I can say about it is that it must have been shocking when it came out in the early 60's with talk of a real nuclear war going on.  Maybe it was funny then, but it sure isn't now."
a-c-kashtanov,"Feb 21, 2016",9/10,"I seriously think that one has to be north American to understand the humor of this movie.My humor is pretty dark, I'd a couple of laughs at some moments during the movie, but overall I can't find it ""hilarious"", as many of the reviewers describe it.The thing is, that there were a couple of analogue situations in real life(in both Russian and North American side), and maybe back then was funny to know via a comedy about how close could the world just end because of some human factors, but watching this today, it's the same feeling as when you watch the Network...And that's the dark side of all this circus - things like these do happen, and a lot."
omgfridge-670-64054,"Feb 24, 2010",10/10,"A movie that can make fun of nuclear warfare during the height of nuclear paranoia while being deliciously amusing certainly fills out the checklist of being a black comedy. Stanley Kubrick has not only made a movie that was great for its time but also is still funny, smart and memorable by today's standards. Still it remains one of, if not the bravest film productions to come out of cinema. The classic scenes, one-liners and performances from both Peter Sellers and George C. Scott launch this bizarre one of a kind movie into masterpiece status. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is essential viewing. Repeatedly I have came back to 'the hot line suspense comedy' and it only gets better."
LongTimeMovieLover,"Apr 7, 2019",10/10,"This movie is perhaps the greatest satire (and dark comedy) ever written, filled with hyperbole, irony and clever wit. Simply genius and no way around it. It's a political statement, wrapped in wry clever humor. This is why Stanley Kubrick is, in my own view, the best director ever. It's so intelligently rendered. George C. Scott's manly ""Commanding General"" persona wrapped in childlike goofy expressions are simply classic."
His_Dudeness74,"Feb 2, 2006",9/10,"After having the pleasure of viewing Dr.Strangelove for the first time, I felt compelled to comment on the sheer cleverness of it ...I knew going in that I was in for a cold war satire, but little else -The contrast between the serious, documentary-style direction with the at times over-the-top characters and dialogue works brilliantly to keep the movie in motion, and the sense of impending disaster is palpable, whilst still allowing the mostly subtle humour to play out.Fairly early in the film, we're given a close up shot of General Ripper's brooding face from an unusual angle, the camera looking up at his visage as if his face were a huge, insurmountable rock - as soon as this superb shot revealed itself I had the uneasy feeling that Ripper might be a bit 'funny in the head' as President Muffley later explains.In his apparent insanity, army base commander Ripper concocts a 'plan' to wipe out the threat of Communist invasion once and for all; unfortunately it involves nothing cleverer than tricking his men into nuking the unsuspecting Ruskies ...The only person in a position to get through to Ripper through his apparent madness is Captain Mandrake (an English officer stationed via the 'officer exchange program'), one of the three characters to appear in the film to be portrayed by Peter Sellers. At one stage Ripper confides in Mandrake as to the extent of the conspiracy theory that led him to his drastic course of action : the Commies are contaminating our 'precious body fluids', most likely through fluoridation of the water supply. How had he come by this umm, interesting theory, Mandrake quite reasonably asks at one point ? - Here, I believe, one of the films key themes and elements are revealed - Ripper tells Mandrake that he first became aware of the Communist 'conspiricy' ""during the physical act of love"" - Ripper goes on to explain (in rather cryptic terms) that after failing to become aroused, or perhaps losing his erection, he came to 'realise' that his bodily fluids were being taken or contaminated. He then goes to some pains to make it clear that the problem had *not* happened again, and that women still found him 'powerful'.In essence, Ripper's failure to cope with his own compromised masculinity led to his insanity and subsequent order to attack the dreaded Ruskies !!So a madman has potentially started world war 3. No real surprise there, as the focus turns to larger-than-life character General Buck Turgidson - the General is at first unconcerned over a phone call from a base commander, accepted by his bathing-beauty 'secretary', and continues his business in the 'powder room' for a painfully long time before finally deigning to speak to the worried base commander himself.Turgidson decides the situation is serious enough to warrant leaving his young, barely-clad lady friend in their hotel room whilst he puts in a little overtime in the War Room. In a later scene, Ms. Scott, his secretary, thoughtlessly rings Turgidson in the War Room - before hanging-up, Turgidson ever-so-briefly reflects upon the precarious situation at hand and thoughtfully advises Ms. Scott not to forget to 'say her prayers' ...Hilarity and double-speak ensues throughout the entire first War Room scene, Turgidson's zealousness to turn the accidental encroachment on soviet airspace into a full scale strike is demented logic at its finest. Somewhat fortunately, the President, once again played by Peter Sellers, is less of a war-monger than the General, and he enlists the aid of the reluctant and shifty Russian ambassador to contact the Russian Premier, the apparently drunk Dimitri Kissoff. Sellers one-sided conversation with Kissoff is a side-splitter, desperate not to offend the Premier whilst still trying to gently break the news of the impending air strikes. The Russians go one-up on the Yanks though, when it comes to light that they have constructed a 'Doomsday device', which is deadly enough to pretty much f*ck up the world - if the rogue B-52's commissioned by Ripper accomplish their illicit mission, they will unwittingly be activating the Doomsday device ! This is when Sellers' third, and most bizarre, character is introduced, the titular Dr. Strangelove. As he 'helpfully' points out, a Doomsday device is an excellent deterrent for Nuclear War - er, provided the rest of the World is aware of the *threat* first ! However, as the Russian Ambassador points out, the existence of the Doomsday device hadn't been announced to the world at that stage as the Premier had planned to announce it at an upcoming conference, due to his love of 'suprises' hehehe. And so it's all set-up for a tense finale, as Mandrake tries to obtain vital codes from General Ripper to recall the B-52's, President Muffley and his cohorts try to work with the Russian government to blow their own men out of the sky to avoid mass destruction, and a B-52 flown by Major 'King' Kong attempts to deliver it's mother lode upon it's intended target before they're shot out of the sky.I could go on and on about how much I enjoyed this film, it's sharp humour, it's psychological profiles of the egomaniacs that would end the world, their sexual insecurity, the petty bickering over relatively insignificant matters while the fate of the world is being decided - but I'll wind it up here and just urge anyone who enjoys movies that encourage you to think to seek out Dr Strangelove : or How I learned to stop worrying and love the Bomb."
gedhurst,"Jun 8, 2014",10/10,"The film opens with the most beautiful credits in cinema history - refuelling B52s as mating dragon flies. The satire starts with the descending chord sequence of the (hauntingly melancholic) orchestration of ""Try a little Tenderness"".Biting cynicism informed by the rueful post-war scepticism and distrust of authority in British society gave rise in Britain to the zany humour of The Goons. Peter Sellers was a founder member of this group and is at the centre of this film in the 3 characters he plays. Sterling Hayden is unforgettable, as is George C. Scott and Slim Pickens. All of them deliver superb lines in one of the best and most humorous scripts of all time.Dr. Strangelove himself makes one brief appearance just before the end, but it's the most devastatingly funny sequence of all in another matchless performance by Sellers, with maybe the funniest line in cinema history.As a kid, I was haunted by the closing sequence. Apparently from a suggestion by Seller's fellow goon Spike Milligan, this takes a popular wartime song and gives it an altogether more poignant and sinister feel.It's difficult to convey to anyone whose formative years came after the fall of the Berlin Wall just how paranoid the Cold War was. Everyone got on with their daily lives knowing that one false move and the world could be engulfed by nuclear Armageddon. ""Dr Strangelove"" attempts to reveal the insanity at the heart of the doctrine of Mutually Assured Destruction with mordant, biting satire. I like to feel that this film was part of a process which steered the world away from the apparent inevitability of Nuclear Conflict in the Cold War years, not least by pointing out just how banal and stupid it could be. Who knows? We made it this far, didn't we?"
MA$E,"Aug 16, 1998",N/A,"The first time I watched this film I thought of it as more serious than funny, most likely because I was young and nieve. The second time I watched it I saw the humor and enjoyed it more. I have come to learn that this was the first Dark Comedy. Stanly Kubrick is probably the best director of all time because he has a classic in ever movie genre. Dr.Strangelove for comedy, A Clockwork Orange and 2001: A Space Oddessy for science fiction ,The Shining for horror,Full Metal Jacket for War, and The Killing and Sparticus for action. Yet again Kubrick proves he can prevail in any genre including comedy."
Incalculacable,"Jul 1, 2006",7/10,"I have to say it: I was quite disappointed with this movie. I originally wanted to see it because of the fact that it is number one for comedy, voted by IMDb users. However, I found myself asking when will it be funny? Perhaps I am just not one for dark comedies, but I just didn't find it funny. That being said, I was especially impressed with the comedic talents of Peter Sellers (who plays four characters: Group Captain, Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, Dr. Strangelove), the atmosphere that is created and the message behind the movie. But I didn't find it funny. Sorry. Maybe it will grow on me.U.S. Air Force General Jack Ripper goes absolutely mad, and sends his bomber wing to destroy the U.S.S.R. He suspects that the communists are conspiring to pollute the ""precious bodily fluids"" of the American people. The U.S. president meets with his advisors, where the Soviet ambassador tells him that if the U.S.S.R. is hit by nuclear weapons, it will trigger a doomsday device which will destroy all plant and animal life on Earth. Peter Sellers plays the three men who might prevent this colossal tragedy: British Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, the only person with access to the demented Gen. Ripper; U.S. President Merkin Muffley, whose best attempts to divert a momentous disaster depend on a drunken Soviet Premier and Nazi genius Dr. Strangelove (who, in my opinion, was the funniest).I think there is a truly good message behind this movie: if we don't do something, this is what will happen. I was very much impressed by that. Comedy wise, I laughed a couple of times, but that was it. That's the problem with critically acclaimed films  you have high hopes for it, and when it doesn't live up to your expectations, it is twenty times more disappointing. Nevertheless, I appreciate the brilliant performances, the message and Kubrick's clever directing. I enjoyed it, but in my opinion it does not live up to the hype."
jameslinton-75252,"May 4, 2016",6/10,"This is quite possibly one of the weirdest films that I have ever seen. Partially a drama, partially a comedy, it is just bizarre. Granted it is funny at times- most of the humour is satirical poking fun at the inept bureaucrats of the time, but it's just so... weird. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, it was just very odd to watch. The humour did well to punctuate some of the darker moments of the film.Although at times I did feel that the humour was very out of place and was quite jarring to watch. Peter Sellers was great in this film. He plays three separate roles and really showcases his versatility as an actor.Read my full review here: http://goo.gl/iqajA4"
nbig868,"Apr 15, 2016",10/10,It is obvious from the rating that the film has something to watch. It starts with the misconception and miscommunication between the higher authorities. The film has a unique impact of mix commotions of horrific end of the world with the endless effect of dark comedy which makes you think that what would be if that be possible. Once again Stan has given the world the phase that what would happen if the two great nations will collide and the flawed results of the prolongation of the cold war and tends the world to use soft power game instead. The nail biting start till the endless horrifying effects in the middle and conclusive end makes this film the one of the best i have ever watched ever in my lifetime.
Kramer36,"Jul 31, 1998",10/10,"i am calling this the best comedy of all time because it was the funniest. I have laughed harder at many other movies but this one really made me think. Peter Seller's really shows his wonderful talent in three surprising role. As the memorable Dr. Strangelove, President Merkin Muffley, and Group Capt. Lionel Mandrake. It's one of the many films i can watch again and again."
drogers-18,"Jun 17, 2006",10/10,"Dr. Strangelove is a classic example of satire as an educational tool. When this film first came out, my gut reaction was that it was anti-American, disrespectful and a plaything of an elite, liberal movie maker. But, I was young, an Air Force veteran, and full of the conservative claptrap. Having the many decades of time between then and now, I view the film as remarkable in its structure, forceful in its message and memorable in the performances. As the B-52 is on its way to the target, for example, the litany of the crew as they prepare for the strike left goosebumps as my earlier experience in military aircraft of the time was nearly identicle is substance and complexity. We were then living on the edge of nuclear annilhilation and viewing this film, even as a satire, shows that the supposed ""Balance of Power"" concept of the time was in fact a ""Balance of Terror"". If Swift's ""A Modest Proposal"" was satire that energized the Irish to their plight, Dr. Stranglove was our energizing message. Surely, this is one of the best films of all time."
SpelingError,"Apr 10, 2016",9/10,"In mine and many other people's opinions, I feel like Kubrick is one of the best directors of all time. He has made many films which are widely considered to be the best of their genre. ""Paths of Glory"" (1957) is widely considered to be one of the best war films, ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" (1968) is widely considered to be one of the best sci-fi films, ""The Shining"" (1980) is widely considered to be one of the best horror films, ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971) is widely considered to be one of the best violent films, and ""Dr. Strangelove"" (1964) is widely considered to be one of the best comedies.After an insane general named ""Jack D. Ripper"" triggers a plan to start a nuclear holocaust, a room full of generals and politicians desperately attempt to stop him before it's too late.Before watching this, one would not expect for it to be a comedy since it's about a nuclear holocaust, a serious topic. However, I was very impressed with how Stanley Kubrick went and did it anyways. I feel like this is actually a very good topic to make a film off of. With that being said, it succeeds on different aspects of comedy.One of the reasons why the comedy in this film works so good is how they get delayed so much. While President Merkin Muffley is warning Russia of the attacks, their conversation gets drawn out, and it makes the audience ask ""Shouldn't they be trying to hurry?"" In most other films, this would be a flaw, but since this is a comedy, this can be excused as it represents more about the comedy. Another great scene is when the U.S. army tries to take over a base with Ripper inside in hopes of finding the recall code to get the planes to abort their mission. Kubrick takes advantage of every single way how this scene could be drawn out, and it leaves the audience laughing at how unlucky everyone is getting. I'm not going to spoil how this film ends, but it's a really great scene which uses this concept.Another great thing about this film is some of its dialogue. My favorite line from the film is: ""Gentlemen, you can't fight here! This is the war room!"" It's a simple line, but it's very effective. Also, some of the one-liners kind of take into effect its comedy where it delays scenes. For example, the scene where Gen. ""Buck"" Turgidson explains Ripper's plan to Merkin Muffley is full of many funny quotes like: ""Well sir, I would say that General Ripper has already invalidated that policy!"". Also, there is the classic ending quote.Finally, there are some jokes that you have to think about in order to get what they mean. Some of them are even left up to interpretation for what they mean. For example, the scene at the end where the Russian ambassador steps away from everyone, and does something with his watch takes a bit of thinking to determine what he's doing, and how that ties in with another scene. Also, the classic quote at the end: ""Mein Fuhrer, I can walk"" has a ton of interpretations that can come from it. Another ambiguous joke is the increasing level of ""Alien Hand Syndrome"" that Dr. Strangelove experiences throughout the film. Finally, there can even be discussion for what the title of the film, and its alternate title mean, and why Kubrick chose those 2 titles for the film.One thing I really like Kubrick for is how he tells simple, yet grand stories with his films. The comedy in this one represents that real well because the more I think about the comedy in this film, the more impressive and mind-blowing it seems.Another great thing I got to mention about this film is its great acting. It is actually very easy for me to decide who my favorite actor is in this film, and it seems like a very obvious choice. My favorite actor from this film was Peter Sellers. He plays 3 different characters (Group Captain Lionel Mandrake, President Merkin Muffley, and Dr. Strangelove). I don't think that his performance was weak for any of these characters, and he gave a magnificent performance for all of them. However, my favorite character that he played was Dr. Strangelove. He is able to act in a weird and goofy tone without ever being annoying. It's hard for an actor to successfully accomplish this, but he did it exceptionally well. His other 2 roles were also great and believable as well. Without a doubt, he stole the show.While Sellers is clearly the best, that's not to say that there weren't any other actors who blew me away. In fact, if I could give almost equal credit to another actor who did a great job as well, it would be George C. Scott as General ""Buck"" Turgidson. He also gave a convincing performance, and he stood out a lot as well. Other great actors include Slim Pickens as Major ""King"" Kong for his consistent, upbeat attitude that he maintained throughout the film; even at times of despair, Sterling Hayden as Jack D. Ripper for his way of sounding like this was a real life, serious film; not a comedy film, and Peter Bull as Alexi de Sadesky because of the suspicious tone he had which unintentionally gave him some charm.In conclusion, this is another masterpiece in Kubrick's brilliant body of work. It hits numerous layers of comedy that can sometimes be pretty deep - this evokes Kubrick's talent of making simple, yet grand stories. Also, the acting is really good as well, especially coming from Sellers who played 3 roles exceptionally. It's no wonder why Kubrick is considered to be so good by his fans, and he continues to impress me even more every time I watch another one of his films."
Vartiainen,"Jun 12, 2018",9/10,"Stanley Kubrick's pitch black satire about the nuclear threat and the ends of which mankind is capable of going to prove its superiority.The plot goes that a US general has gone rogue and ordered a nuclear attack against the Soviets. The radios have been disabled and there's no conceivable way to call off the attack. Men in the War Room argue back and forth, assigning blame, getting desperate, getting emotional. While on the skies the planes march towards Soviet airspace - undetectable, unstoppable.It's a beautiful scenario, made even more poignant by its sheer absurdity. It tells something about a movie when it opens with a message from US Air Force, stating that the thing showcased in the movie could never, ever, under no circumstance, no way, no how, happen. Now please crawl out from under your beds.And this could be an unbearably heavy movie. But Kubrick helms it as a satire. The characters are amazingly out there, as are the lines of dialogue, the sets, the music. But the subject matter is still so large, so huge, so scary, that horror lurks underneath all the comedy. It underlines every scene, every moment. Most of us now have grown up in a world where nuclear war has always been a possibility. And in this film that fact can never be forgotten.The acting is also superb with the MVP award easily going to George C. Scott, playing the role of one the president's military advisors.Fantastic scenario, fantastic film making, fantastic actors. You'll laugh, while also feeling the cold sweat dripping down your spine."
neigenoirejz,"Jun 2, 2013",6/10,"I get why people like this movie so much, I get the (scary) message it conveys by making us laugh at such a serious issue. What I don't get is the praise of G. C. Scott's performance. He was almost the only character that seemed to me somewhat boring and unlikeable (with the exception of a couple scenes, I'll admit). I very much enjoyed Seller's performance, though. Call me slow, but when I first watched this film, I completely missed the fact he played three different characters! Very solid and versatile acting, thoroughly enjoyable.As for the pacing, sadly the movie does seem to drag at times. And the moments I found myself genuinely laughing, although plenty enough, were stretched somewhat far apart from each other.Some elements felt a bit contrived or redundant, e.g. all the officials in the war room just sitting there like props while Turgidson and the president had a 10 minute dialogue. Some of the plane scenes were a bit lengthy and tedious. The terrible accent of the ambassador Alexi (when speaking in Russian) made me cringe, although this won't be an issue for those who don't speak or understand Russian.The movie is OK to watch once and perhaps deserves a rewatch for the superb comedy and the fantastic acting by P. Sellers. But I don't think it's the best in Kubrick's arsenal. It gets 6/10 from me."
leah-coakley,"Jan 28, 2006",1/10,"I love Stanley Kubrick. I love Peter Sellers. I even love James Earl Jones. But this movie is not a comedy. It's not funny. Someone falls down. Someone else gets shot in the eye with a spray of water. If you've seen Full Metal Jacket, don't expect that level of humor. The characters are poorly sketched. George C. Scott is awesome, but he's toned down for some reason (PG rating perhaps too cautious -- I'd go with G). This doesn't reflect the talents of any of the crew or cast. And you probably won't laugh once. War sucks. Granted. You don't need to have a shoddy accent and physical comedy to prove it. Oh and PS - irony should NOT make you laugh out loud. PLEASE. DON'T."
fischer-bill,"Feb 2, 2016",10/10,"This classic by Stanley Kubrick is not only a cracking good story but reflects the times in which it was released. A stellar cast combined with silky black and white production, this film has so much going for it, it is hard to know where to begin. This is satire at its best. Each fully developed character is played with gusto, especially Peter Sellers who has no fewer than three roles. George C. Scott as General Buck Turgeson is also granted some terrific lines that he delivers with a almost child like awareness, completely oblivious of the import of what he is saying. The film switches between artfully crafted, beautiful composed cinematography and a rugged hand held documentary style. There are scenes in a b-52 bomber that are so realistic that you feel you are right in the airplane. Anyone who wants to see a group of actors and a brilliant director, all at the top of their game, will enjoy this movie."
minabasejderha,"Sep 12, 2018",10/10,"I've watched this multiple times before. Once as a child, a few times in university, and this was the first time since. Every time I've enjoyed it more than the last.One of the times I watched it was for a joint event I organized for the MTSU Cinema Club and MTSU ACM Siggraph. The plan was double features that thematically paired a classic film with an animated film. I paired this movie with The Iron Giant, the theme being Cold War science fiction and paranoia.I had a disagreement at the time with the faculty advisor who felt I was essentially trying to turn Siggraph into Cinema Club, though no other officers of the club felt that way, nor did members. The event was actually quite a success. I'd have done more of them, but the advisor went behind the backs of the officers and canceled its advertising. As I'd said at the time, the point was to show that animated films could handle complex thematic material that we are comfortable admitting is in classic movies. I at one point nearly shouted at him that if it had been a purely cinema club event, I'd have paired Dr. Strangelove with Inglourious Basterds, the themes instead being black comedy and American xenophobia.And for years I couldn't get that movie pairing out of my head. So last night, finally, my partner and I watched them together. Both movies try and explore, in hyperbole, the ways in which we Americans have caricaturized the people's with whom we've had political strife.My major complaint about the film is one I shared with my partner, though she was the only one to verbalize, there are essentially no female characters. Well, there's one. Scott's character is sleeping with his secretary, and so she is in one scene. I'm uncertain where one could have been, given that the plot essentially all takes place in a few ""boy's clubs"".The best actor in this movie is certainly Peter Sellars, though George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden were excellent as well. Sellars plays multiple roles with different accents, costumes, and hair. (The first time, when I was a child, I didn't even notice they were all the same.) But the main reason I keep coming back to this movie is the morbid humor."
Elcasten,"Jan 9, 2006",10/10,"One of my favorite films. I never tire of it. The dark humor and the zealous insanity of the protagonists to avoid the ""doomsday gap"" never cease to elicit an uncomfortable chuckle from me. It is also worth noting that it does not seem much of a stretch to imagine our current world leaders playing their equivalent roles in the film. All of Stanley Kubrick's work is brilliant in one way or another, but this is my favorite of all his films, due to its satiric wit and edgy humor. I personally believe that this film should be required viewing, just to hopefully avoid a real-life situation that would parallel the one in the picture."
deepakahlu,"Jan 27, 2016",9/10,"Shooting the breeze with some close friends and fellow film enthusiasts a few evenings ago, talk turned to the cinema of Stanley Kubrick. Due obeisance was paid to 2001 A Space Odyssey, the possible long term psychological trauma induced by watching A Clockwork Orange at the age of 14 (as my son claims to have done) was chewed over, and 'what the hell went wrong' with Eyes Wide Shut was debated.My personal favorite from the Kubrick stable — the sharply intelligent and insanely hilarious 1964 cold war spoof — Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb. Three Peter Sellers, one George C. Scott, a loony general obsessed with contamination of bodily fluids to kick off the glorious madness, and the most hysterically funny phone conversation you will ever hear between the President of the United States and the Premier of USSR.The film is rated #49 in the top 250 films of all time on IMDb, so I'm not kidding!"
mrmystery99,"Apr 29, 2018",10/10,"I never really bought into the Kubrick hype. I mean: don't get me wrong; I like all of his films very much - but to me, they all feel somewhat ""over-constructed"" and lack a natural flow. And then I finally got to see 'Dr. Strangelove'. Wow. What a terrific, pitch black satire. This film is so wild and mean and funny - and Peter Sellers gives THE performance of his career. Unlike in any of Kubrick's later works, there's a sense of playfulness here that gives the whole movie a crazy kind of energy; I'm guessing that Seller's love for improvisation forced Kubrick to ditch his usual perfectionism to a certain degree (and the film is all the better for it). Sharp, outrageously entertaining comedy/satire by one of the most revered directors of the past century."
tatamata1,"Jul 25, 2007",10/10,"This is clearly a masterpiece, and probably one of the best movies ever made. A good laugh made out of a horrific theme. And the theme is not only the threat of the nuclear war - moreover, it's a threat of insanity and stupidity being infiltrated in the highest decision making circles, which literally decide the faith of the world.Both most important geniuses of this film, Kubrick and Sellers, very well know that when fighting stupidity, a good laugh can often be much more effective than a ton of serious warnings.If you are by any chance amongst those who didn't see this movie - don't wait for another second. Find it, watch it, laugh and think about it. It will entertain you, but it will also make you think about deadly serious matters."
jndgreer,"Jan 25, 2002",N/A,"As the son of a cold-war era B-52 pilot (who thinks burnt JP-4 smells good) this movie holds a special place in my heart.  Interestingly, the men of dad's squadron were ordered by the base commander to go see it!  It was an instant favorite of those Strategic Air Command warriors.  Despite director Kubrick's black-comedy approach, the dedication and professionalism of these men can't help but come through.While Sellers undeniably shows the most versatility (and sheer acting genius) of this great cast, it's hard not to fall for Sterling Hayden as the whacked Base Commander.  His cigar-chomping soliloquies on flouridated water and the Red Menace are priceless.  This movie is a must-see."
ales-mrak,"Aug 6, 2005",7/10,"This movie is very good. It shows (liked or not) the exaggeration in fearing of communism. I did not live then and there, and I can not imagine and feel the emotions and fear of American people to communism and cold war. But as far as I'm acknowledged with the history of cold war, this film had to be a very top in the film industry of its time. Its has very positive roll: its shows that, the nuclear weapon shouldn't be used at any cause, even thou if the enemy are Russians. Only the mad general would use the nuclear weapon and start a war. Nowdays just a simple black and white comedy, but in those days it had to be a black humor comedy and almost an horror movie. Its like in now days we would be seen a comedy of Bin Laden's attack on Europe or USA. Greetings"
DaveDiggler,"May 6, 2008",8/10,"Watching ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"" was a refreshing comedy on mass destruction and the insane predicament during the Cold War and the Nuclear arms race. ""Mr. President, I'm not saying we wouldn't get our hair mussed, but I do say no more then ten to twenty million killed, tops. Depending on the breaks."" is said by General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott). Turgidson says this to President Muffley (Peter Sellers- in his first of three supporting roles) in the ""War Room"" as Gen. Jack Ripper (Sterling Hayden) has gone ""psychotic"" and ordered 34 planes to Nuke Russia (U.S.S.R) because he thinks the commies are trying to spoil their ""precious bodily fluids."" He says the meaning is ""water,"" but the low angle shots, almost as if the camera is in Hayden's lap, of Ripper sucking on a large cigar only scream of something more than just bodily water. I don't know what to make of that. As Turgidson debriefs the President, some of the best scenes of the film are shot in this one room- the War Room and let's be perfectly clear, there's no fighting in the war room. Turgidson informs the President that Gen. Jack Ripper has complete control and has shut off all communications to the base and the secret code, that only he knows, that can get in contact with the planes pilots have no contact with anyone. So, the President has no way of stopping the planes from dropping the bomb because Ripper has shut off all communications- sounds like some of the stories you hear from the 60s. This leads to a great, one-sided, phone call to the head of Soviet Premier, Dmitri, that might leave younger audiences thinking this is some kind of impersonation of President George Bush, but it's not. Peter Sellers best performance of the three roles comes as the President. The scenes between Scott and Sellers are both electric and very funny that hit on all six cylinders. President Muffley informs Dmitri that he's very sorry that 34 planes are on their way to drop a bomb that will ruin the entire civilization in the USSR, so he orders his own plans to be shot down and assists in the attack giving it the okay. Turgidson disagrees with the idea and would love to wipe out the entire Communist regime, but US policy is not to Nuke first. We Nuke second. It's only proper. ""I'm sorry, too, Dmitri... I'm very sorry... *All right*, you're sorrier than I am, but I am as sorry as well... I am as sorry as you are, Dmitri! Don't say that you're more sorry than I am, because I'm capable of being just as sorry as you are... So we're both sorry, all right?... All right."" President Muffley sounds very sorry. Quite panicked as well (Not really, which makes it all the more funnier).I thought Sellers gave the best performances as the incredibly off-the-wall, enthusiastic General with more plans on his mind than destroying millions of people- like getting back to Miss Scott, who's in his bedroom on a countdown. Sellers, as Dr. Strangelove is exactly how you think he would look and act. Is it over the top? Yeah, very much so, but his ridiculous quirks and possessed right arm that seems to have a mind of it's own is very funny, especially when you couple that with his survival plan for when the ""Dooms Day Machine"" goes off. That's the really big nuke that will kill everybody on the entire planet if the USA pilots reach their targets and in order to save the human race, Dr. Strangelove says all the top generals and leaders of the world will have to live in a coalmine for about 100 years with a 10:1 ratio of women to men. This perks up the attention of General Turgidson and puts a smile on the face of Dr. Strangelove, even though he has a permanent smile on his face. The best scene in the film may come when the pilot of one of the planes is riding the bomb on it's way down to earth as if he's at a rodeo just living it up. That wonderful bomb has so many great advantages when you really think about it: A lot of sex with a lot of different women, you can ride on them like a cowboy, you can eliminate millions of commies there's just much good that can come of a bomb such as this. The fact that this was made right in the middle of the whole fire storm makes this film even more appreciable, now, more than ever. There are some great performances, good laughs, and a very engrossing look on annihilation and mass destruction as numbers are thrown around like numbers instead of human casualties. Other than the look of the airplanes resembling more paper planes on strings than actual airplanes, there's really not much to dislike. Very rarely do you see a refreshing comedy that was made over 40 years ago, but I've seen just that as ""Dr. Strangelove"" has some serious staying power. It's a near-masterpiece. This should be Kubrick's best film, but I certainly see why ""2001"" may be regarded higher."
dan-292,"Nov 9, 2001",3/10,"Why this film is so popular is beyond me, first and foremost because it is not really funny (yes the no fighting in the war room remains a great gag as does riding the bomb, but the rest of it....) the satire is about as subtle as an oil tanker and to be honest misfires. The camera work is average, acting average, but the use of music is good. Ultimately it is a film locked into time and place - and that is quite damning enough."
BroadswordCallinDannyBoy,"Jan 5, 2006",10/10,"At the height of Cold War tension crazed Air Force General Ripper orders his wing of bombers, which are circling just outside of Soviet territory, to attack the USSR. The Pentagon scrambles to put the situation back under control as Ripper has cut of communications from his base and his bombers will not respond to radio transmissions unless a mysterious code is first entered. The Soviet ambassador, called into tell the Soviet Primier that this is all just a mistake tell the Pentagon War Room, much to their chagrin, of a doomsday nuclear missile launching device that the Soviets built to counter any nuclear strike against the USSR. With the world just moments away from total nuclear annihilation, what is there too do that might save humanity?With this film Kubrick has crafted a brilliant look at not just the Cold War, during which the film takes place, but a look at paranoia, uber-patriotism, faith, and many other topics that are just as relevant in today's world as they were back then. Kubrick was an obsessive perfectionist with his films to make them work just right and this film, like many others of his shows that. Clever framing of objects in key scenes, most notably a big banner that reads ""peace is our profession,"" which is in the background of a raging shootout, and the impeccably directed performances of key players in the film -- George C. Scott as General Turgidson, a calculating general on the edge of losing his mind, who gives a terrifically over the top performance ;Slim Pickens, the captain of a B-52 and determined to rain hell on the USSR; Sterling Hayden, as General Ripper, is also great as an American Patriot brought to the frayed ends of sanity by paranoia and ""flouridated water in his bodily fluids."" ; also, Peter Sellers' triple performance as Captain Mandrake, the US President, and Dr. Strangelove (three voices of sanity, well almost) in an otherwise insane situation, is terrific.Cast aside, the film's real power comes in it's presentation of the world stage and the irony of it all and the fact that there are two sides to every coin -- war is both a nation builder and a nation destroyer, nationalism both creates trust and demolishes it, paranoia both helps to keep the military in top shape to protect their nation or it can destroy everything we now know and hold dear. Finally there is the film itself -- both shockingly disturbing and very funny. 10/10Rated PG for some violence and generally unsettling material"
agrawalmannu,"Oct 5, 2005",8/10,"Dr. Strangelove must be the best political satire to have come out during the cold war era. As the president puts it to the soviet premier ""one of our base commanders went little funny in his head and did a silly thing"". Apparently the silly thing that president is talking about is that this commander ordered his planes to attack Soviet Union and drop the hydrogen bomb. As a deterrent, Soviet Union has a doomsday device which, if attacked, will automatically get triggered ending the world and both the processes are irreversible of course.The conversation between the president and the soviet premier has to be one of the funniest that I have heard. The statement ""gentlemen, you cannot fight in a war-room"" should be taught in colleges as an example of irony. Peter sellers in a triple role is absolutely amazing. It is ominous, it is dark and it's hilarious."
gilbert_and_sullivan_pwn,"Feb 16, 2008",10/10,"Dr. Strangelove's only curse is that it is in black and white. The only reason this is a curse is because it will make it less interesting to younger viewers (for some unexplainable reason).Peter Sellers is perfect for the three roles he plays as George C. Scott. I am not a person who will laugh out loud easily, but in more than one spot this movie had me doing so.Aside from being a good movie to watch six or seven times Dr. Strangelove has helped me in my US History classes. After all hearing Dr. Strangelove explain just what deterrence is sticks in your head far better than a teacher explaining the same term. The last scene with Dr. Strangelove and co. sums up the Cold War as well as any history book could have and in a lot more memorable way."
sjb7,"Feb 23, 2006",10/10,"Each time I view this film I always discover something I missed at a prior viewing. This time it was the opening music soundtrack. It was such a perfect fit."" Try a little tenderness"" was such an appropriate choice to only add to the zany hilarity of this of' brilliant film. Peter Sellers,in his arguably best role(s) is a master of disguise and George C. Scott turns in a stellar performance. The rest of the cast is up to the task of making this one of moviedoms greatest. My favorite part is the war room scene and the discussion between the President and General ""Buck"". The banter between the two of them is most uproarious and the steadfast demeanor of Sellers is a true testament to his acting genius. This film along with ""A Clockwork Orange"" I think are Kubrick at his best."
Jimmy-63,"Feb 11, 1999",10/10,"In my opinion, Dr. Strangelove is truly one of the best movies ever made.  It is such a great satire about the intrinsic insanity of the nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union.  The genius of the movie is that it is not overtly funny - it conveys the situation in a plausible way in the context of the story, bringing out the lunacy of our doomsday scenarios and MAD policy against the Soviet Union, and theirs against us: the definition of the Cold War.  I also thought that in this movie, and I have seen a lot of movies, I saw the best acting of any movie I have ever seen.  Everyone played their roles perfectly, and I'm not just saying that casually.  I personally think that acting is very easy and nothing to celebrate, but Stanley Kubrick really found the best actors he could for those parts - they really could not have been acted better. Everyone was absolutely great, and I genuinely do feel that it should win the hypothetical best acting category for all-time movies.Dr. Strangelove was ingenious and artistic AND very entertaining.  Its cinematic value is immense, and I consider it one of the best movies, if not the best movie, that I have ever seen.  I exemplifies what artistic moviemaking should be."
gascichx5,"May 26, 2009",9/10,"This is an extremely funny film. But after my own analysis and reading some of the negative comments on here I came up with two reasons as to why people may not find this funny.1.) It's outdated. This movie was made with the backdrop of the Cold War and impending nuclear holocaust, and is a satire about just that. Kids growing up these days, or even ten years ago, have no concept of what it was like during the 50's and 60's.2.) It's such a great comedy, that other films and TV shows have stolen its jokes. Like all great works of art, they are imitated to some degree. Jokes from this movie have been used to death by other mediums, and I think that makes them lose their effect if seen in this movie.Having said those two things, I didn't grow up with the threat of nuclear holocaust and I've heard the retelling of Dr. Strangelove's jokes, but I found this movie to be absolutely brilliant. Peter Seller's jumped to one of the top 3 of my favorite comedic actors. Every actor was fantastic. The writing was brilliant, and all the characters add the hilarity that ensues in this film. The story was great and extremely ridiculous, but still plausible, especially for that era.Overall, a tremendous film by one of the greatest directors of all time.9.5/10"
Sandcooler,"Jul 13, 2012",6/10,"This movie used to be one of the most caustic satires ever captured on celluloid, which kinda shows how far the limits have moved since the 60s. Don't get me wrong, I do of course understand people took offense to this. Mocking nuclear warfare in the middle of the Cold War is daring no matter how you look at it, and furthermore it creates a thoroughly bitter-sweet atmosphere only paralleled in Chaplin's ""The Great Dictator"". But when it comes to the actual execution of the idea, the whole thing is sorta goodie two shoes by today's standards. Only Peter Sellers really manages to get in your face from time to time, and that's mainly because most of his material is improvised. The actual script seems pretty well thought-out and balanced, but the dialogues often just lack zest. Occasionally there's a decent one-liner in there (""There will be no fighting in the war room!""), but often the scenes just serve purely as exposition and go on way longer than they need to. Still, the movie seems to pick up steam around halfway and leads you to an absolutely hysterical ending that makes it all worth it. Not Kubrick's best, but far from bad."
joliet-jake,"Aug 24, 2005",10/10,"i finally rented this and i kick myself for waiting so long to see it. the movie is classic and if you love movies you should see this one. the movie is a spoof of the bomb scare and the cold war. everything about this movie is genius. although it has aged with time it is still up there in my opinion as one of the best, and definitely one of Kubricks' best. the movie is definitely funny and the plot is quite intriguing and somewhat scary. the movie though is a complete spoof and a great black comedy. the war room scenes are all classic and their plan at the end for survival is great but i am not going to spoil it for you. Kubrick did a great job of creating a classic piece of film and i highly recommend this movie to everyone."
lagudafuad,"Nov 17, 2012",6/10,"Did I enjoy this Stanley Kubrick film? Yes. Is it excitingly funny not really, although it rated as one of funniest movies out there, I will say one thing, which is Kubrick, did a good job of making a mockery of the cold war crises that was looming at the time of this movie's release.Dr Strangelove, is as captivating as the name, especially when you say it in full Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb, my favourite scenes in this movie were when the commander of the bomber Major T. J. Kong, was riding the nuclear missile and the other is where Peter Sellers as Group Captain Lionel Mandrake was begging for 50 cents and he had to ask someone to shoot a Coca-Cola vending machine.Peter Sellers was actually set to play four roles in the movie, but it was later reduced to three and Slim Pickens played Major T. J. Kong which was meant to be played by Sellers. So Sellers played: 1. Group Captain Lionel Mandrake (which was my favourite character of all) 2. President Merkin Muffley, the American President. 3. Dr. Strangelove, a wheelchair bound German nuclear war expert and former Nazi, who has a gloved right hand that is uncontrollable and whose heart is still Nazi.The movie plot is about a general that went rouge and decided to kick off the nuclear war. He arranged a strike on the Soviet Union, and then made sure that the call back code to end it would not be found.The US president and his cabinet tried all they could to get back all the 34 planes that were going out for the strike, but they could only reach 30 and the Soviet shutdown 3 but one was heading off towards the target and there was no means to call it back.The movie was set to be released around the time of the Kennedy assassination but was pushed back, because the producers felt the nation did not need to see a movie like that at that time, there was a pie fight scene that was cut, because the was a line that went ""Gentlemen! Our gallant young president has been struck down in his prime!""Dr Strangelove as i said is a lovable film, and it will keep you glued, but to me it is over hyped, so i can't fully say it is a most watch but maybe you should give it a try and give me a buzz about your thought.www.lagsreviews.com"
susan7,"Jul 18, 2002",2/10,"Dumb!  Really dumb.  The whole thing, from the base commander to Strangelove to the Russian Ambassador.  I can't believe this is in the top 250, let alone as high as #11.  Is there no one here who can think?  Tell me, please, what is there in this movie that makes it good?  I'd really like to know. It's not the music.  It's not the character development.  It's not the story.  It's not the comic relief.  My God, it's not even the absurdity of the whole thing.  And while the picture of Slim Pickens riding the bomb might be mildly amusing, surely everyone didn't vote this move so high just for that.  Or did they?  Hummmm."
girtholomew,"Aug 8, 2006",10/10,"I'll reveal my bias; I have always loved this film and I think I may even have loved it before I watched it because it is such a hugely irreverent and successful satire of what was and still is a very serious business. The film/book it is parodying, Fail Safe, is a good film in it's own right but has not stood the test of time in the way Dr. Strangelove has, despite its strong cast and script. I think this is because Dr. S delivers most of what Fail Safe delivers but adds to it with comedy and very well-observed satire - this film still provides food for thought about the sanity of high states of strategic nuclear readiness.The script is very strong and is delivered, in the main, by two talented actors on top of their game, George C. Scott and Peter Sellers (who plays 3 characters excellently). I always find myself laughing throughout this film at the dialogue and the situation and this owes a lot to the genius of these two men and their on-screen delivery.If you're at all interested in this film then I implore you to make it the next thing you watch!"
KI-16,"Aug 28, 2005",10/10,"Can you believe the original was lost in a fire. Imagine what that must have been like. I go to the film forum in NYC ever year to watch the annual showing of the film. It never disappoints. There are so many great lines and performances they can't be mentioned here.The late great Peter Sellers was hilarious, but the other late great George C. Scott was off the chart only because you didn't expect to see him play a comical role. There's a scene when he's sitting in the 'war room' with his head slightly lowered and looking across the room at the president. The look alone is hilarious, he grimaces and delivers a few moments later a comical line like, ""when the Russians look the big board, they are going to go absolutely Ape!"" Or something to that affect, I nearly fell out, he was dead pan funny.My top ten favorite movie are very difficult to choose but his one is in my top five...easily. Top five: Alien, Dr. Strange Love, Little Big Man, Taking of Pelham 1,2,3, Ninth Configuration and Catch 22."
NoArrow,"Oct 2, 2003",10/10,"""Dr. Strangelove"" is a very black comedy spoofing such things as patriotism, paranoia, and nuclear war.  The plot focuses on Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott), who mastermind a plan to create a nuclear holocaust and destroy the ""Ruskies"".  Behind it is Dr. Strangelove (Sellers) and defending the human race are the U.S. President (Sellers) and Ripper's officer Mandrake (Sellers).  The trio of roles by Sellers is simply hilarious, not to mention Scott and Hayden's A+ performances.The screenplay and direction are also remarkable, in fact, that word sums up a whole review: remarkable, 9/10."
Bokomaru,"Jan 24, 1999",10/10,"This is one of the funniest, darkest movies ever.  The humor is pure genius, suttle at times, outrageous at others.  The casting is excellent, especially Peter Sellers as Dr. Strangelove.  A perfect stereotype ""stolen"" German scientist.Although the effects are definitely outdated (the planes especially), the script is not.  The humor still works: the womanizing general, the infamous war-room scenes, the precious bodily fluids.I recommend this movie to anyone with a dark sense of humor or a pessimistic outlook on life.  Dr. Strangelove should brighten your day.  Though, the movie must be carefully studied in order to get the full effect.We must all thank Mr. Kubrick for not going the serious route as originally intended.  I would love to see the pie fight scene, which was initially intended as the ending, but the current ending is a little more high-brow."
gortx,"Mar 22, 2025",N/A,"DR. STRANGELOVE (1964) It's hard to wrap one's head around how much of an impact Stanley Kubrick's classic had on Cold War America. This was a hard slap to the bow, using satire as a weapon to shake up the world to the true madness of ""M. A. D.""- Mutual Assured Destruction.Peter George based his screenplay with Kubrick and Terry Southern on his more serious minded novel (Red Alert). The result is a no holds barred lampoon of the crazy world we lived in - and STILL DO. As great as the script and Kubrick's Direction are, it's the cast that propels the film to a different level, even above and beyond Peter Sellers' famous troika of characters. George C. Scott, Slim Pickens, Keenan Wynn and especially Sterling Hayden all deliver iconic performances. Hayden's Jack D. Ripper with his conspiracy theory obsessions with 'bodily fluids' is a indelible (is there any doubt that a modern day Ripper would be a hugely successful podcaster?). It's also great to see James Earl Jones in an early role. The only quibble is that Kubrick sometimes allows bits to go on a bit long including the title character. But, with Sellers et al. In such prime form who was to say ""cut""?DR. STRANGLOVE is a deserved classic that remains ever relevant."
avik-basu1889,"May 17, 2017",7/10,"In 'Paths of Glory', Kubrick attacked the military hierarchy system and the concept of war and blind patriotism from a moralistic standpoint. In 'Dr. Strangelove' he does somewhat the same thing in the form of satire. He managed to generate humour out of a disturbing scenario of a mentally unstable army officer starting a nuclear war without the knowledge of his superiors. Although personally I love 'Paths of Glory' much more than 'Dr. Strangelove', however this is the film where the quintessential Kubrickian style of direction and storytelling was born. One can notice the black comedy, the formal visual style(like camera placement, lighting and editing) and a distinctively deliberate coldness in 'Dr. Strangelove' that would become a staple in pretty much all of Kubrick's subsequent films irrespective of the genre.There are a lot of laugh out loud moments here. The satirical tone infused by Kubrick is overt and unavoidable. Pretty much every conversation scene is rich with sharp dialogue and scathing criticism. However I'd be lying if I say the film stayed with me and lingered in my thoughts for too long. I understand what the film is doing and I admire the technical precision involved, but 'Dr. Strangelove' didn't blow me away like most of Kubrick's later films do. The film tends to meander a bit with unnecessarily extended scenes where we spend time inside the fighter planes during which I genuinely found my interest waning due to the overabundance of technical verbal exchanges. I also think the film's ending should have been stronger.Acting wise I have to mention Peter Sellers, George C. Scott and Sterling Hayden. Sellers(in multiple roles) and Scott provide the eccentric and over-the-top comedy, while Hayden is the deeply intimidating psychopath.I do like 'Dr. Strangelove', but not as much as some of Kubrick's other works"
ambrosewriter,"Jan 3, 2009",10/10,"Most everyone in film, taking a film class, or a serious viewer knows the wonderful end sequence of this movie. For those of you who don't, I won't tell you, but suffice it to say it is a symbol of the death of the American and America. This movie is positively, absurdly hilarious, but comedy aficionados know that it doesn't contain any fantastic one-liners or puns, but it's a masterpiece of black humor. This film is one of Kubrick's best outings and it entertains. The more you watch it the better it seems, but like most movies it is best watched in one uninterrupted sitting. Great movie about MAD and a pessimistic social commentary (that makes you laugh). 'Dr. Strangelove' would be a good use of about $15 (depending on which version you purchase) and if you don't want to buy, rent!"
Seraphion,"Sep 4, 2014",6/10,"The movie does depict a scary story of the old Cold War era fear of nuclear doomsday and the subsequent stalemate of the nuclear deterrence between the two superpowers. I really like how the movie shows the subtle but crazy scenes right after it builds up the suspense of imminent nuclear or retaliation threat. The phone dialog, or should I say monologue, between the two presidents are just a sheer twisted laughable scenes. Like most Kubrick movies, this movie also leaves the audience with quite an incomplete movie, having them wondering about the continuance of the story after the movie's abrupt ending. The acting is just nice because most of the actors can successfully depict the madness under stress of nuclear threat and also the crazy funny scenes."
tjgoalie13,"Oct 22, 2015",9/10,"Out of one of the most tense times in U.S. history came one of the more crude and witty satires on the U.S. approach and policies. The film was a spoof of the entire American special forces, and their protocols. Dr. Strangelove was a witty satire of the paranoia towards communism, the overly complex emergency protocols, and the U.S. special forces leadership. It was also most likely a film that would predict the future culture of America. In the mid 1960's, when Dr. Strangelove came out, respect for the government was paramount to the masses, this trust would be violated just a few years later with the war of Vietnam. Looking at that maybe it's best to say Dr. Strangelove was slightly ahead of it's time, and maybe it even helped shape the future cultures opinions. Either way the irreverence that Dr. Strangelove showed towards the U.S. politicians and special forces was at the time, controversial, mostly because the most accepted idea was that these people and institutions were off limits. The film was brimming with irony, most likely symbolizing that Kubrick felt the cold war, and paranoia had an ironic air to it. The film seems to reinforce that Kubrick thought the whole situation was ridiculous, and the irony of the hysteria wasn't lost on Kubrick either. There are examples of this littered throughout the film, and Kubrick obviously found something funny about it all, it's easy to look back and laugh, but at the time this film was bold, because it was as scary as it was funny to those watching it. As was mentioned earlier the film's cornerstone is the ironic humor, for example the ironic scoring. Kubrick was a master of using music to further his movie, especially in 2001: A Space Odyssey, but in this instance the music was an extension of Kubrick's opinions. Used brilliantly the music had a peaceful scariness, as soft melodic music plays over bomb carriers flying through the sky. Another element Kubrick wouldn't shy away from, especially with irony, was the overly masculine posturing of both countries. Irony was also used to satirize the U.S. leadership, often showing the irony of the special forces. Good examples of this are the poster reading ""Peace is our Profession"", or Slim Picken's talking about promotions as they unknowingly go rogue, or the most famous quote of the film ""Gentlemen you can't fight here, this is the war room."" All of these are great examples of the overly militarized society that we were living in, something Kubrick must have hated. Coming at a time of change for the country, and possibly helping that change happen Kubrick boldly satirized one of the most respected organizations in the United States with reckless abandon. However, maybe in doing so gave the country exactly what it needed, a vehicle to laugh and poke fun at how ridiculous the countries were acting. Considering the opinions of culture towards the military, and other satirized organizations, it seems obvious that Dr. Strangelove was drastically ahead of it's time."
smorris-29,"Nov 14, 2007",10/10,"The film is brilliant, upon several levels. Peter Sellers portrait of Group Captain Mandrake is excellent, he slightly distrusts the USAF officers, but his comments about the Japanese...'but they do make such good cameras!' still rings true, nearly 50 years later. The film needs watching a fairly large number of times - try to look at the file George C Scott has on his knee in 'The War Room' (OK, it's 'World Targets In Megadeaths), or goggle as Col 'Bat Guano' refuses to use his M1 carbine to blow open the Coke machine to allow Mandrake to get change to phone the White House to try and avert nuclear holocaust. 'That is the property of the Coca-Cola Corporation...' As to water fluoridation? Well, I'm a dentist, so I think it's all a Commie plot, and I'll stick to 'pure grain alcohol'. Trivia...they had to re-record Slim Pickens' listing of the contents of the B52 'emergency kit'. Originally, he quipped 'a pretty good w/end in Dallas', but JFK's assassination occurred B4 release, so he went back into the sound studio and dubbed 'Vegas' instead. 100% recommend. My favourite film of all time. Dr Steve Morris"
justahunch-70549,"Feb 27, 2024",9/10,"I'm not sure how you review a touchstone film that is now 60 years old. Some of it is no doubt dated, but oddly enough some of it is very timely particularly the issue regarding the fluoridization of our waters and I say this as I moved to a state that absurdly won't allow it as they fear what it may lead to. We also live in a time that everybody is suspicious of everything most particularly vaccines. Odd days indeed, but they were for slightly different reasons in 1964 as well. This extremely black comedy holds up very well, though I didn't find the comedy part quite as humorous any more. The story of a rogue general who has lost his marbles who has sent a plane to Russia with a nuclear bomb just doesn't seem to have the humor it once did. The acting is superlative particularly by Peter Sellers in three roles, but in retrospect I'm amazed at how good George C Scott and Sterling Hayden are. Stanley Kubrick's only comedy is still an important film and it's still a unique film but it's being judged through new eyes and I'm not sure how relevant it is to everyone any more. Nevertheless this is still a unique and important one of a kind film by a master filmmaker."
pooch-8,"Jan 21, 1999",N/A,"Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick's masterful study of the foolishness of war and the incompetence of the men who start them, is blacker than pitch and funny in ways that most films can't dream of approaching.  Faultless direction, writing, and performing cemented the picture as a modern classic, making it hard to believe today that it was something of a wild card in its initial release during the chilliest days of the Cold War.  The incomparable Peter Sellers devours three roles, and is equalled by the sublime turns of Sterling Hayden and George C. Scott, never more brilliant or funnier than they are here (playing gum-smacking, belly-slapping, gung-ho dim bulb Buck Turgidson and paranoid, crazy as a woodpecker, ""precious bodily fluids"" loose cannon Jack D. Ripper, respectively).  Keenan Wynn and Slim Pickens are also top-flight."
asda-man,"Apr 22, 2015",6/10,"My immediate reaction to Dr. Strangelove once it finished was one of dislike. I thought it was talky, boring, plot less and overrated. However, since I've had time to let it sink in I've begun to like it a lot more on reflection. It's undeniably very well-made and beautifully shot, yet it still gives no inclination to Stanley Kubrick's colossal genius of scale and intelligence which he would later produce in 2001.To be honest I never fancied Dr. Strangelove. Watching a political comedy is my idea of hell, however I thought I'd finally give it a try as I'm venturing through every Stanley Kubrick film. It's not a laugh out loud kind of comedy; it's more of a lightly amusing one, although I must admit that some parts had me chuckling. I especially enjoyed the part where the president talks to a drunken Dimitri. Other bits of comedy fell flat for me, however such as the Nazi stuff, although I do understand that comedy is very subjective so it's just a matter of what you find funny. My favourite comedy film is Mrs. Doubtfire, so judge me however you like.I found the story surprisingly straightforward. It's basically set in three locations: The planes about to bomb Russia, the office of the mad general and the war room. The film is essentially just about trying to stop bombs landing on Russia in order to prevent a nuclear Holocaust. However, because it's such a bold idea it remains quite involving. The running time is also very tight so it prevents it from getting too boring.Strangelove is a film which I strangely liked, more than loved. I think that repeat viewings will help to uncover its hidden intelligence. However, for me it's a step backward from Stanley's previous three films (Lolita, Paths of Glory and The Killing) which I enjoyed more. I must say that Peter Sellers was fantastic in this though and it is definitely well worth a watch. Who would've thought that just four years post-Strangelove, Stanley would release such a masterpiece?"
Heiniken,"Feb 13, 2007",10/10,"Where do I start? This movie is incredible, I loved every aspect of it. Kubrick really was a genius, and this is one of, if not THE best picture he made(ties with clockwork). The movie is filled with great acting and memorable quotes, and you can't do anything else than love it!The story begins when general Jack D. Ripper gives the order of nuclear attack on Sovjet. He believes the communist are trying to destroy the precious bodily fluids with fluoridated water. To him everything is a communist conspiracy. He bases his belief on his recent impotence. Peter Sellers character(the British officer) is forced to stay with Ripper to get the call back code to the planes, which Ripper is in possession of and is the only one who knows it.When the president(also played by sellers)finds out what has happened he gets the idea to call the Russian president up on the phone and have a conversation. This off course ends in hysterical bickering back and forth. Quote: Well I'm sorry to Dimitri! I'm perfectly capable to be just as sorry as you are Dimitri!!.The very best part in the movie is the scenes with Dr. strangelove. Peter Sellers was a grand actor no doubt about it. Dr. strangelove is a nuclear expert and an ex nazi. He seems to have some disagreements with his fight hand which tries to choke him and shot out in nazi salutes. He is a hysterical character, and my favorite thing about the movie.George C. SCotts character is really funny as well. Not all the credit should go Peter Sellers, Scott acting is almost as brilliant as Sellers.All in all this movie is great. It takes a lot of talent to make a subject as serious as the cold war and make a comedy out of it, and a brilliant one at that. PS: please excuse my spelling, not the brightest of students!"
GiraffeDoor,"Apr 30, 2019",5/10,Kind of dated. I get what it's trying to say and it's not that it's subtle it's just kind of lacklustre. I'm a bit so what about it all.The multiple characters of Peter Sellers just feel self indulgent and it takes a long time for this movie to smugly come round to the revelation that not all politicians are the most admirable of people.It's not a comedy and it's not a dark comedy. They tack on a comedic tone to the familiar red scare paranoia caricatures and you can almost here the canned laughter.And of course you shouldn't fight in a war room. That's not ironic at all.
comicfreak,"Mar 5, 2010",10/10,"The movie Dr.Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb is a masterpiece in its own right if your like me this is your kind of comedy its NOT one of those comedies that makes you laugh so much then half-way in tries to be really serious this movie is very smart and clever well first ill talk about the reasons you should go see the good things about it well the acting is great on Peter Sellers part and George C. Scotts part i think the movie was well thought out and seamed to work perfectly the black and white is great i like it and if its ever re-made the remake will never be as good because of the actors, Stanley Kubrick and they wont use black and white which completes the movie their are no bad things i can find about this movie after i saw it i was amazed its one of my favourite movies a you have to see this movie to know how great it is rent it or buy it sometime and be in for a treat!

mtenga,"May 24, 2002",10/10,"Most people like me who are reaching their mid-thirties are likely to have watched thousands, or maybe even tens of thousands of movies. Unlike my parents, we are part of a generation brought up on television. That being the case with so many fine movies around it is difficult for me to pinpoint one as an absolute favourite. But this film would certainly have a good shot.Peter Sellers and George C Scott probably give the performances of their rich careers. After having now watched the movie 30 or 40 times I still find myself laughing at the deadpan and stiff English Officer Group Captain Lionel Mandrake. Sellers as the President is entirely believable and as the German scientist Strangelove both funny and frightening. Scott is hilarious as the paranoid war-mongering General. The scene where the President asks him ""have they got a chance?"" will live in my memory forever. Keenan Wynn, Slim Pickens, Stirling Hayden and the lovely Tracey Reed are all simply excellent in support even though Wynn and Reed only have cameos. The fact that some of the jokes are obvious and telegraphed and that it sometimes descends into slapstick, only adds to the effect.It is funny and a parody but it quite accurately portrays a number of serious points. 1, The paranoia of politicians and the military. 2, The fear that technology was starting to rule men rather than the other way around. 3, The well known, but not talked about much reliance that the American military placed upon recruited former German scientists.Whilst the film is a parody and meant as a comedy I believe it hurt the American political and military establishment so much that they banned it in the States for a while. Fail-Safe, that other excellent nuclear accident film was released around the same time and suffered by comparison to Strangelove.The film is a salutary reminder that at almost anytime our future and safety could possibly be in the hands of people who are unstable, or machines that are far from reliable."
muhon-nin,"Jan 1, 2007",10/10,"The smooth, cool, and funny way that Kubrick made a real issue feel. the fact that it had enough seriousness to provide a deep and emotionally layered story, bouncing back and forth from character to character till Maj. ""King"" Kong rides the bomb. Other movies like ""Fail Safe"", directed by Sydney Lummet, basically had the same message, but it didn't have the cool feel that Dr. Strangelove supplied. This movie should have won at the Oscars. Kubrick should have been noticed as the great director he is, and Peter Sellers should have won for playing THREE roles!! I believe that everyone should see this movie, and any who doesn't should shut their pie holes!! 10 outta 10!!!!!!!"
British_Revolver,"Oct 4, 2005",10/10,"If Peter Sellers is in it, you know you have something good. One of his greatest films was ""Dr. Strangelove Or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying and Love The Bomb."" (Also a Kubrick favorite.)I think that Sellers should've won the Best Actor Oscar for his performanceS in this movie. Who in the world can play three different characters in one film and do great as Peter?This is a well made movie and should be on everybody's favorite movies or must see list. George C. Scott and Stanley Kubrick also deserve more credit and more applause to this movie. ""Dr. Strangelove"" is a classic masterpiece about war and the consequences of it."
paxdriver,"May 18, 2015",10/10,"I enjoy it for the same reasons I did back then, but have a deeper appreciation for its significance now than I did when I saw it first. I strongly believe that this is Kubrick's magnum opus. The method of presentation itself is a socio-political message, but I won't elaborate any further to avoid the risk of spoiling it. A large part of the movie's genius is how it manages to function superficially as a comedy, an extremely dark satire albeit, but a comedy nevertheless. It also works quite effortlessly as a drama once you scratch beneath the surface; and finally, as a whole it is a masterfully orchestrated period piece, tiered with humor, humankind's gravitas to tragedy, and existential philosophy. It's brilliance is in its stratum, never mind the all star cast performances, writing, score and directing.It's not often in art people have to agree on a great work, but in this case it stands apart from contemporaries and classics no matter how the movie's viewer approaches it. It is a work of genius without a trace of exaggeration."
atifkazi,"Oct 13, 2004",N/A,"This is a great film, for its time, and it was introduced at the correct time (after the cuban missle crisis). It highlights the need for Weapons of Mass Destruction, to be rid off.The Background to the film: A renegade general of the US Air Force who is mentally unstable, triggers of the process of a wipeout of the USSR, his motto, hit them before they hit us.....and so it begins.

murali83,"Sep 18, 2005",6/10,"Guys, I am a big fan of Stanley Kubrick and I have seen all his movies so far except 'paths of glory'. Personally I feel Dr. Strangelove is a bit overrated. The movie has hardly 5-6 scenes were you can laugh or see through the sarcasm considering the fact that, that was the purpose of the movie.Story wise, it is definitely innovative as expected of Kubrick but most of the movie is a let down.Peter Sellers is impressive in all his 3 roles though ironically he played the role of Dr. Strangelove for the shortest duration among all 3.Definitely worth a watch but by no means a classic."
redeagle717,"Jan 15, 2006",9/10,"Dr. Strangelove is a true American classic that will always be one of the greatest movies ever made. It is a funny, satirical work that takes place during the Cold War. Peter Sellers delivers a classic performance as Dr. Strangelove, President Muffley, and Captain Mandrake- three performances! His acting wasn't as strong as it could be, but Dr. Strangelove is a truly classic character. George C. Scott delivers a strong, supporting performance along with Sterling Hayden. There are performances from James Earl Jones and Slim Pickens, as well. This is one of Stanley Kubrick's best movies and if not his greatest work. This is a must see for anyone. 9/10"
Theodevereaux,"May 19, 2017",6/10,"Words can't explain the high hopes I had going into this film. The premise was super intriguing, and the cast was great, not to mention the director. Unfortunately what became of that was boredom, and confusion. I really did understand the satire that was taking place, but being ""in"" on the jokes didn't seem to help make me laugh. The character of Dr. Strangelove really confused me, since reviewers are saying the performance was amazing and hilarious... I'm not sure what I missed there. Maybe if I knew to look out for how amazing it was supposed to be, I would've received it better, but on its own merits, I found the character to be bizarre, not in a good way, and overplayed when on the screen for more than a minute. I really really really wanted to like this film, but maybe only being 19 when I watched it, I wasn't born with the right mindset for this satire."
SoulPoet1818,"Oct 6, 2002",10/10,"This movie is a classic, not only its age and brilliant directing, but its original plot.  Stanley Kubrick did an amazing job with the characters and acting style.

If you are interested in film-making, etc. I highly recommend you watch this piece of art."

Mainly, this is due to Stanley Kubrick's direction, and the triad of hilarious characterizations from Peter Sellers, who plays stiff-lipped British ""Captain Lionel Mandrake"", deadpan American ""President Merkin Muffley"", and spastic German scientist ""Dr. Strangelove"". Sellers is at his best portraying the relatively low-key President, trying to calm down his hysterical Russian counterpart on the telephone.""Listen, Dmitri,"" apologies Sellers, after the US launches a nuclear attack on the USSR, ""I'm sorry too, Dmitri..."" Slim Pickens riding ""The Bomb"" into oblivion is an iconic image; it's the satirical apex of ""Cold War"" masculinity. This will undoubtedly sound blasphemous, but Mr. Kubrick should have given the non-war room segments (specifically, the office and cockpit scenes) a sharper edit. And, the inter-cutting ""pie fight"" ending, incorrectly dismissed as too farcical, should be restored.********* Dr. Strangelove (1/29/64) Stanley Kubrick ~ Peter Sellers, George C. Scott, Sterling Hayden, Slim Pickens"
FrankBooth_DeLarge,"Aug 19, 2005",10/10,"Cold War tensions are very high, and US bombers have been ordered to destroy the USSR. The plan has been started by insane General Jack Ripper, who fears that the Soviets will destroy Americans' ""precious bodily fluids."" A war room full of Generals, Politicians, the President, the Soviet Ambassador, and wheel chair bound genius Dr. Strangelove, must stop Jack Ripper from succeeding in his plan. If the bombers attack the Soviet Union, a doomsday device that the soviets have will be triggered and it will ""destroy all plant and animal life"" on earth.This movie's tagline ""The Hotline Suspense Comedy"" says a lot. There is a lot of suspense in this movie, and it is funny at the same time. This is a great political satire, as it pokes fun at the cold war and how Americans feared the Russians. While the movie is really funny, it is meant to be seen a couple of times. There is a lot of subtle humor present, that is hard to pick up on when you first see the movie. Much of the humor comes from the hysterical Performances by comic genius Peter Sellers. He plays three characters, but the most memorable character is the wheel chair bound Dr. Strangelove. One of the funniest moments with his character is when he has trouble controlling his hand, and it ends up choking him. Another character played by Sellers, The President, also has a memorable line, ""You can't fight here, this is the war room.""Stanley Kubrick is a genius. This movie shows how he has a sense of humor, and he also displays his masterful directing skills. There is one scene in this movie which involves military combat. That scene is about 20 years ahead of its time. The hand-held camera movements are very realistic, and this was made 24 years before Saving Private Ryan. The special effects involving the bomber flying are also great. The model of the bomber is realistic looking, unlike the fake models that often plagued black and white movies of long ago. And the background effects are also pretty realistic. I'm surprised this didn't win an academy award for Best Effects.The other actors are good, especially George C. Scott. It's kind of funny to think that he played General 'Buck' Turgudson, and then a few years later he played real life WWII General George Patton.Dr. Strangelove is a brilliant movie. Peter Sellers gives great performances(he plays 3 people, which makes the movie even more fun), there are plenty of funny lines, the direction is great, and the story is very good. The humor in this is a lot funnier if you know more about the cold war. Those who are kids and haven't learned much about the cold war might not understand this, and might not find it to be funny. Otherwise, Dr. Strangelove is a classic that I highly recommend"
jcombs1995,"Jul 24, 2014",10/10,"Hailing as my favorite movie, Dr. Strangelove is the greatest dark satire to grace the silver screen. On par with any works of Kurt Vonnegut Jr., Dr. Strangelove lampoons the Cold War. With three great performances from Peter Sellers, George C. Scott playing a patriotic(and often zany) general, Slim Pickens giving his best John Wayne impersonation as a pilot, and Sterling Hayden being Sterling Hayden there are plenty of laughs to be had. Kubrick doesn't stop at satire, spanning slapstick, visual humor, sexual innuendos, political humor; Dr.Strangelove has a bit of everything. Stanley Kubrick forces us to laugh at the mutual destruction of our planet, and shows us that in the face of Dooms- Day anything that can go wrong will go wrong."
Dethcharm,"Oct 15, 2020",N/A,"DR. STRANGELOVE is arguably the greatest example of pure black comedy ever captured on film. Such comedies are extremely difficult to pull off, considering that it involves making fun of ""taboo"" subjects and / or laughing at things that are supposed to be ""off limits"" for humor.It speaks to the genius of Director Stanley Kubrick that it started out as a serious tale of potential nuclear holocaust, evolving into this satirical masterpiece. Anyone looking on at the time might have thought that the whole idea was insane. Obviously, Kubrick knew what he was doing.Working once again with the incredible Peter Sellers, Kubrick has him play three roles this time. Sellers runs off with the whole show, improvising an RAF Captain, the US President, and the title character! He's in rare form here, proving his versatility and comic expertise.George C. Scott, who is not really known for comedy of any sort, is hilarious! His gruff, bug-eyed Gen. Buck Turgidson is the second -or fourth after Sellers' three- most memorable character.Sterling Hayden's turn as the utterly unhinged Gen. Jack D. Ripper is sublimely bonkers. As the man responsible for taking us to the brink of nuclear annihilation, his theory about ""communist vital fluid contamination"" is brilliant in its lunacy!Slim Pickens will forever be remembered for his fateful ride down on ""the bomb"". He and his entire B-52 flight crew are wonderful, including the one and only James Earl Jones.From the opening ""refueling"" scene, to the finale and ""mushroom cloud"" end credits, STRANGELOVE captivates the mind as much as it tickles the ribs..."
ttommy-1,"Feb 11, 2008",7/10,"Could not help but find correlations between this 1964 satire about nuclear holocaust and our present day war against terror and those with weapons of mass destruction, whether they have them or not.George Scott was excellent and funny in a strange way. It is not hard to sell danger and create a panic among others. One only needs to tell them they are about to be attacked. Whether the assertion is true or not makes no difference.The scene where the pilot of the plane climbs down to free a jammed door and rides the atomic weapon joyfully to its target reminded me somehow of our own George W."
MovieLoonie,"Oct 18, 2005",10/10,"I didn't see this movie for years, because the clips I had seen here and there didn't interest me. I finally saw it an realized I had missed out! What a brilliant, brilliant story. Very subtly witty and full of satire. Peter Sellers is amazing playing 3 different roles, each to perfection. One of the top ten best movies I have ever seen. I'm not Kubricks biggest fan, but for this one, he deserves all the praise he gets. Seemed to start a little slow, but stick with it. It gets more and more outrageous as the film progresses until you are mired in insanity. Peter Sellers has some of the funniest bits (although Slim Pickens has a great memorable moment himself) the one sided phone conversations of Sellers as the president talking to the premiere of Russia are a riot! a Must-See movie for any film lover."
kairingler,"Aug 22, 2008",7/10,"Peter Sellers plays 3 different characters in this movie,, now that's something you big Hollywood actors of today wouldn't dare dream of. I think that a first time viewer of this film won't get it.. i think you need to appreciate the classics before watching this film,, it is a black comedy that does poke fun at the military,, Sellers performance was nothing short of brilliant,, wish Strangelove character would have had some more screen time,, but all in all i was happy, George C. Scott wow, what can i say,, he stole the entire show for me.. James EArl JONes is in here also, basically a general goes loony, and orders his boys to bomb the crap out of Russia,, President finds out and all heck is breaking out in the war room, where the Russian Ambassador is waiting for them,, i think that this movie is funny,, kinda dark, hard to get at first. but overall good, although for me not quite an 8.7.. maybe a 7, but good nonetheless."
dan-896,"Oct 5, 2004",2/10,"Why is this movie rated the 16th best of all time, and the all time greatest comedy?I'd been planning to see this movie for a long time and after checking out the rating here on IMDb, finally decided to rent it. I thought the film to be less than average at best. The acting mediocre, the jokes dated. This could have been so much better - given the subject matter. I realize I'm in a minority here as the percentage of voters giving the film a low score is also low. Am I missing something? Best comedy of all time...tricky one? The Big Labowski maybe?"
parkinglot,"Feb 20, 2004",9/10,"A 20 year old won't relate to Missile Gaps and Commies but would surely appreciate the acting in this excellent film. When portraying the President, Peter Sellers' American accent is dead-on. George C. Scott is just hilarious as the paranoid General--his gestures and facial expressions bring my me knees with laughter every time I watch him. Even the dead-pan Army Colonel is funny. The director makes excellent use of B/W lighting and camera angles when on the actors.A good contrast to Dr. Strangelove is the film Fail Safe from the same era. Both have the same plot but tackle it entirely differently; no laughing in Fail Safe."
Jawa11182,"May 19, 2002",10/10,"When I think of Dr. Strangelove, I think of a Great, Hilarious, Well Thought Up Masterpiece, directed by the great Stanley Kubrick.  This movie had many great old time actors that make a great comedic performance (especially George C. Scott and Peter Sellers).  Most of the humor is dry which may not get everybody's attention but if you really listen to the jokes, you'll get them.  I thought this movie was not only funny but very well thought up especially that this was the only real comedy that Stanley Kubrick made.  I give Dr. Strangelove a 10 because it is just that good."
wesberger,"Sep 30, 2005",10/10,"An incredible mix of gut-curdling suspense, blacker than black humor and cosmic absurdity.Terrific performances by all the principles although Sterling Hayden and especially Peter Sellers deserve special mention. The scenes with the two of them in the crazed Hayden's control room are each masterpieces.One of the best anti-war films ever made and still terrifying and funny as hell today.I am a huge Kubrick admirer and I think this might be his very best film."
bmwbsa,"Jul 5, 2007",N/A,"A Merkin is an item of French origin. I am not sure at what point in French History it was developed but I would imagine it came about in the 18th or 19th Century.

charlesturner-75605,"Nov 4, 2022",7/10,"I found Dr. Strange love to be a hilarious film. It was very satirical and had a lot of dark humor to it. Whoever thought that Stanley Kubrick could make a hilarious film such as this. The whole premise that there is a plan to drop a bomb off in Russia by a psychopathic General at a base is insane. Everyone is trying to stop it, and is scrambling to fix this utterly horrible mistake. There are so many great moments in this film. I really enjoyed the moments in this film. One of the best is the dialogue in the war room scenes. It is utterly hilarious and the satirical nature makes it so funny. By far one of Stanley Kubrick best films."
strike-1995,"Feb 5, 2019",7/10,"Satire at its keenest, they sell sellers makes his picture. Hey are wring. George c Scott kept me laughing at this films absurdist take on the most deadliest of issues."
evaray107,"Feb 14, 2007",2/10,"I thought this movie would be a dark comedy. Toward the end, however, it tends toward stupidity for no coherent reason. the film was SO close to being thoughtful & inventive that it was painful to see it botched. The almost-funny dialog goes on and on and on and on and on and on (see where I am going with this?), in a most boring manner, with no purpose whatsoever. So you are left wondering why you just had to sit through 10 minutes of nothing. Then action scenes cannot redeem the movie, because the actors are not believable. Slim Pickens in particular made me roll my eyes in annoyance. Maybe it was supposed to have been funny - The only funny thing is that I couldn't tell. George C. Scott may have acted the only well-played roll. Peter Sellers attempted to overly-differentiate his various roles, and his Dr. Strangelove is portrayed with the finesse of a burlesque show. I must rethink my opinion of Kubrick movies. This should have been a very good film, but it was NOT. It could have been worthy. But instead, it was painfully awkward."
judealexharnett,"Nov 13, 2023",8/10,"Stanley kubricks Dr strangelove was a very entertaining movie but not the type of movie I imagined stanley kubrick making. It's a black and white, satirical anti war, comedy. I actually consider this movie to be quite funny but it really does highlight he ridiculousness of both nuclear warfare and the cold War itself. It shows how so few men, that you could fit into one room, have the power to practically destroy the world. And the odds of one of such men becoming obsessed or crazy is very high. Not only that bur Dr strangelove himself is very clearly a nazi similar to how another well know nazi Werner Von Brauhn was cleared of his war crimes and made head of Nasa during the cold War. Definitely an interesting movie."
evanston_dad,"Apr 29, 2005",9/10,"""Dr. Strangelove"" had to have seemed strange indeed to 1964 audiences. This came out in the same year as colorful, old-fashioned Hollywood fare like ""My Fair Lady"" and ""Mary Poppins."" Yet ""Strangelove"" is far from old-fashioned or even colorful. Kubrick's film is stark and cold with a documentary-like air to it. It's also riotously funny. Peter Sellers is a film treasure. This film is a an orgy for Sellers fans, since he plays no less than three different characters, stretching his chameleon-like acting abilities to the limit. The funniest of his three characters is the dead-pan president of the United States, and the film's funniest scene involves him trying to gently break to the Russian premiere that we are about to launch a nuclear attack on his country. His portrayal of the title character is also inspired, and the image of Sellers in that wheelchair wrestling his black-gloved hand into submission with that crazy shock of hair and crazier glint in his eyes is unforgettable.The film also sports a great supporting cast, most notably George C. Scott as Buck Turgison, who discreetly takes calls from his bikini-clad girlfriend during war room briefings, Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper, who wields his cigar like a dangerous weapon, and Slim Pickens, as the pilot of the plane that is about to end civilization as we know it.My only complaint with the film is its somewhat sluggish editing, especially in the scenes showing the fleet of bombers on its way to their Russian targets. At times, the movie actually drags slightly, even though it's only 90 minutes long.But this is a minor quibble about a film that has rightly earned a spot in the cultural conscience of America. It will never be irrelevant as long as the ability to wage nuclear war exists, and it doesn't look like that problem will be going away any time soon."
kent_tm,"Mar 26, 2017",10/10,"Nearly perfectly composed black comedy. From the bright glare of the war room to the hand held filming of the siege of the air force base, each scene is brilliantly staged by Kubrick. The stark black and white cinematography only contributes to the perfection. You will be laughing at Armageddon."
bennett-39,"Nov 3, 2006",10/10,"What does this film not have?Romance maybe, but in the meantime this Kubrick masterpiece, in collaboration with the quintessential Peter Sellers role of all time, delivers what could be said as a film that quite literally woke us up at time when the end was truly near. Absent this visionary creation, I have often thought that we may have not made it through the 60's, only to be now finding ourselves again facing the planetary peril of climate change, and sadly the very same dangers showcased in the film, still omnipresent and hair-triggered for the end of the world.The first time I saw this in the 70's it gave me hope that we can survive. I no longer know if that is true, but there is enough hope in this one to go around amidst its brilliant satire.This film is one that everyone who lives today should take the time to see."
Litefoot,"Jan 1, 1999",N/A,"Arriving in the culture around the same time as ""Fail Safe,"" Kubrick's classic probably does a better job of calling attention to the nuclear threat caused by our national paranoia because it makes us laugh.  ""Fail Safe"" relied on stark terror.  Often to the point that we were so frightened we turned away.Using a parody format, Kubrick allows us to see the lunacy without scaring us to the point of avoidance.  Excellent work."
helpless_dancer,"Apr 10, 1999",7/10,"I hope the people running things are not as stupid as the morons in this film. An insane U.S. general starts in motion the sequence to send nuclear destruction on the Russians. They, of course, begin their's. Then the 2 sides begin a conference of negotiations, culminating in the cessation of all hostilities. Or does it? A wild and wacky ride by a cast of unforgettable characters."

It was really bad I don't wanna disappoint people who love this but I really couldn't even watch it I could hardly stay on my seat.. ."
MisterBernstein,"Jun 16, 2004",10/10,"Unlike many movies, this one can be summarized in one word: Brilliant. It mixes black humour with contemporary issues like no other movie before it and since then, and has sustained the test of time by getting more hilarious and thought-provoking with each new viewing. This remains Stanley Kubrick's finest film. Particularly noteworthy as being the writer-director Kubrick's first and only venture into the comedic genre, Dr. Strangelove is one of the funniest films ever made. It appears that Kubrick got a bulls-eye on his very first shot.Other interesting anecdotes: The sets for this movie, designed by Ken Adam, were so convincing that people, upon visiting the White House, asked specifically if they could see ""the War Room"" as shown in Dr. Strangelove.This was also the screen debut of James Earl Jones, who plays a pilot on Major Kong's (Brilliantly portrayed by Slim Pickens) bomber.This was Peter Sellers' second movie working with Kubrick. Sellers also delved into the roles of Clare Quilty/Dr. Zempf in Kubrick's equally magnetic 1962 film Lolita.With Dr. Strangelove, Stanley Kubrick has created the masterpiece of the 1960's, and has hopefully created something that will be remembered in the annals of movie history."

Bernie4444,"Nov 11, 2023",10/10,"For those that have not seen the movie, which is highly unlikely, this is an improbable situation where a base commander is in the position to order an attack on Russia.This movie was originally supposed to be a serious movie based on the book ""Red Alert"" by Peter Bryant (Peter George). Now it is converted into a black comedy with many great stars including Peter Sellers as one of the characters. (It would have been four characters if not for a broken leg).The DVD (special edition) is worth purchasing even if you have earlier versions. There are also later editions with a different mix of goodies. Many DVDs contain what they call extras (I call them Goodies). In a lot of cases, they are just rehashed versions of the movie or just rattling. In this case, the extra ""Inside the Making of Dr. Strangelove"" rivals the movie itself for entertainment and useful content. You find out how the movie evolved from a serious piece to a seriously black comedy. You find that the movie is an aggregate of many talented people. It would take too long to describe the details that motivated the movie so you will just have to purchase this edition.There is also a trailer for ""Fail-Safe"" a rival movie on the special edition.Dame Vera Lynn's ""We'll Meet Again"" (1942)We'll Meet AgainWe'll meet again,

Ali_John_Catterall,"Nov 22, 2009",10/10,"On his first day in office, Ronald Reagan reportedly asked to visit the White House's 'War Room'. Much to his chagrin, it didn't actually exist, having merely been invented for Stanley Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove. (This was the same Reagan who once believed the Bomb could be 'recalled' after it was launched.) You can't really blame him; the funniest, most frightening take on mutually assured destruction ever dropped on cinemas, released a few months after the Cuban missile crisis, seems so authentic because it dares to articulate certain terrible truths. Strangelove, satire? You must be joking. This film is note-perfect, from Terry Southern's script to Peter Sellers's astonishing juggling act. And, of course, that war room."
Johnny V-2,"Dec 26, 1998",10/10,"This film is a classic for good reason. A satire modern for its time, and one that matures exceptionally well, it provides great insight into the inherent insanity of mankind. From the insane general who sets the wheels of nuclear war 'a churning (for the good of the ol US of A and the purity of his bodily fluids), to the apparently giant flaws in the strategies of both the americans and the russians, never has such an important lesson been expressed in such palatable manner."
bat-5,"Jan 6, 1999",N/A,"Dr. Strangelove, the name alone makes you giggle.  Stanley Kubrick's cold war satire is still one of the best black comedies ever made.  The movie basically states that all military officials are nuts.  You've got Sterling Hayden as General Jack D. Ripper who is obsessed with bodily fluids.  George C. Scott as gung ho Buck Turgidson.  Slim Pickens as bomb riding Major Kong and Peter Sellars as Mandrake, the President, and of course Dr. Strangelove, whose right hand still holds allegiance to the Third Reich.  Best thing to do is get a hold of the Criterion laserdisc and watch the film, then watch the actual films that were produced by the U.S. government about what to do in the event of a nuclear war.  They are just as funny as the film, plus they were serious!"
antonjsw1,"Apr 15, 2010",10/10,"Our political leaders would be well served if they watched this.It brilliantly highlights the stupidity of nuclear weapons. Kubrick's visual style is more obvious, but interestingly its performances that really shine. Sellers is truly magnificent, at his ad-libbing best. From the straight US President Merkin Muffley to the exasperated RAF Officer Lionel Mandrake, to the absolutely crazy Dr Strangelove. However, what is amazing about this film is the excellent performances by other actors, notably George C Scott as Captain Turgidson, Slim Pickens as Major Kong and of course Sterling Hayden as a hilariously unhinged General Jack D Ripper. Satire permeates the movie, from the character's names through to the whole situation itself of unauthorised use of nuclear weapons to the implied jingoistic attitude of the senior US Air Force officers such as the Turgidson character. The narration is clear and efficient, and the structure of the plot is incredibly well put together and moves along at great pace, with a variety of twists to keep the tension up until the films crazy climax.Technical credits are impressive, bearing in mind the films modest $2 million budget, and the fact that the film was made entirely in England. It grossed about 4 to 5 times that amount. Laurie Johnston's music though used subtly works very well, Gilbert Taylor's Black and White cinematography together with Kubrick's trademark camera-work, is excellent, as is Ken Adam's production design and Anthony Harvey's editing. Most notably creation of the cockpit and interior of a B52 is really impressive. Smaller parts, particularly the rest of the crew of the featuring B52, come across well, as does the Russian Ambassador played by Peter Bull. Optical effects by Wally Veevers are also solid.All in all a crazy but accessible comedy that gives you something to think about"
emilyginNYC,"Aug 5, 2022",6/10,"Different things characterize a Kubrick film: cold style, a languorous deep camera, intellectual humor. But for me, all of these pale compared his primary concern: investigating who the narrator is.He hated 'Sparticus' and struck out to do intelligent work. His collaboration with Brando failed, so he bought 'Lolita,' the most adventurous narrative literary experiment til then. It featured a narrator who is obsessed, possibly mad and surely not to be trusted. Kubric (rather radically) translated that layered presentation into the POV of Quimby, who assumes multiple characters, either driving or populating Humbert's worlds.He would later hit paydirt in '2001' with the idea of three battling narrators (human, machine, alien) for control over what we see. And later with 'Orange' about a film that indocrinates itself through film.Along the way, he tried this: four narratives all provided by Sellers. The idea was that each man imposed or reported his own reality and you really wouldn't know which to trust. Our man Peter broke his leg though and the whole thing shifted, but it was changing character throughout based on other accidents as well. Yes, I know there is a story, but it really doesn't matter. In fact it matters so little it changed every day, and so did the tone of the film.Scott turned out to be comically stronger than guessed. The president morphed into someone less fey, the pie scene (which was to be a Marx Brothers tipoff) failed.So I see this as minor Kubrick, a failure of what he intended. It is a great Sellers film for the Von Braun/Ed Teller bit, and for that it is appreciated. But if you want to see a master succeeding at something only he seems to be able to do, you'll need to look elsewhere."
seanlyden,"Jun 9, 2012",1/10,Watched this movie because it is supposed to be one of the best comedies ever and I did not laugh a single time. It was a struggle to get through and I kept thinking that something was going to happen that would make this movie a tiny bit funny but it never happens! I feel like I just wasted the last two hours of my life and felt I had to write a review so people would think twice about watching it. Please don't! Maybe if you are into really really dark old comedies you might enjoy it but otherwise stay away! The only funny character is General Buck and he is only mildly amusing. Terrible! I don't get why people like this movie so much. Maybe I just don't get it and I understand that it is supposed to show how stupid nuclear war is and the people that were for it but it is just awful. Please don't waste your time like i have.
petraktheman,"Apr 16, 2025",9/10,"A very sharp and quirky satire on the Cold War that cuts deep into the stubborn hubris of America's paranoid nationalism that scrapes so closely to the edge of global nuclear annihilation on a daily basis. The plot is spun into such a funny catastrophe as one crazy general sets the nuclear planes loose while everyone else scrambles to undo the mess before Russia and the world set ablaze. George C Scott steals the show for me and is hilarious in every scene he's in with so much energy and charisma. The wormy president's phone calls with Russian diplomat Dimitri were also a riot as they devolved into an old married couple constantly trying to reassure each other. The titular Dr Strangelove is used sparingly in the movie, but he's very funny and a deep cut warning about how fascism never truly dies, even after the nazis have been vanquished. Even a young James Earl Jones has a small role as one of thr pilots in one of his earliest film appearances. The final scene with the Cowboy tiding the nuke is so iconic and sharp that the satire just speaks for itself. It's a great farce and has aged brilliantly into the light of modern day globalist politics."
trogdor74,"Mar 28, 2010",10/10,"I remember the first time I saw a Stanley Kubrick film was 2001: A Space Odyssey. I was completely at a loss of words from the pure style of the film and it was instantly my favorite film.Stanley Kubrick also became instantly my favorite director because his style was so genius. However, I felt it odd that he be my favorite director if I'd only seen one of his films so I hunted down some of his other ones. Then, I saw Dr. Strangelove.The film is a black comedy where a man named General Ripper decides to send off a multitude of air-crafts to bomb Russia and kill them once and for all. These ships are unable to be recalled unless one has a special radio code to call them back with. General Ripper cuts off all communication with his base and throws the U.S. into a nightmare which they desperately try to avoid.The thing that really hits home about this film is that everything that happens during its course is possible, especially during the Cold War, during which the film was fabricated. The entire time you're laughing your ass off, you are suddenly being interrupted by how extremely terrifying the situation is. Nothing could possibly hit home harder.This film is brilliant on so many levels. One of its most notable aspects to me is how it so seamlessly the film blends absolute horror and absolute comedy. In fact, the film was so effective in its dramatic elements that I barely even recognized that it was a comedy at first. I mean, I knew that it was supposed to be a funny film but even today, everything in that film hit right at home and terrified me. When I saw it again, I felt like I was going to explode with delight and laughter. The gags are some of the most memorable of all film and for their time were extremely daring. Although, every time I watch it, there's still something about the pure situation that the story goes through that disturbs me.The gags, as I've said before, are purely brilliant. Perhaps the most brilliant is the running gag of General Ripper (Sterling Hayden) and his obsessive quest to burn down the ""commies"" to stop their evil conspiracy to polute ""our precious bodily fluids."" This man is so insane that you can not possibly take him seriously. He is a parody of the standard politician who somehow manages to tie together completely unrelated things and form some kind of disturbed conspiracy, leading to pure idiocy and collapse. In all actuality, he reminds me of Glenn Beck in several ways or at least what Glenn Beck would've been like during the Cold War.Another brilliant gag comes from the president trying to appease the Russian president while explaining to him that they've accidentally sent several ships to destroy their country. Not only that, the Russian president is completely hammered and unable to make reasonable judgments. The entire conversation proceeds like a train wreck from hell and is probably one of the most brilliantly written scenes of all cinema.There are so many incredibly funny moments in this film that I could not possibly list them all and part of what makes this film what it is is Peter Seller's excellent performance, or performances.Peter plays three people in this film; The President of the United States Merkin Muffly, General Ripper's group captain Lionel Mandrake and the hilarious Nazi Scientist Dr. Strangelove, from which the film derives its title. Every single one of his roles are funny for different reason. His president of the united states is just great as a mediator but a completely unsuccessful leader, him as Lionel Mandrake, the nervous officer who understands the complete absurdity of General Ripper but is unable to escape from it due to a lack of will and his memorable Dr. Strangelove is a ridiculous parody of the nazi scientists we paired up with during those times. Without him the film would've just been another comedy.George C. Scott also does a terrific job as a disturbed Military General whose only goal is to cover themselves up so they aren't hated by the entire world (""I'm saying only 10-20million killed, tops!""). Most every performance in this film is of grade-a quality.Dr. Strangelove is brilliantly written, directed and acted on all levels and is one of the best comedies ever made. It is also an extremely intelligent satire on politics and the several political issues of the time which, to an extent, still mirrors the political issues of today. I highly recommend this film."
karl_consiglio,"Nov 8, 2006",10/10,"Kubrick's first major success. Staring peter Sellers in three roles, as Dr Strangelove, President Muffley, and group Captain Lionel Mandrake. The film tells the story of General Jack D. Ripper who seals off the air base he commands, and orders a fleet of B-52 Bombers to strike the Soviet Union. The army is forced to storm the base, and Ripper commits suicide, taking the recall codes with him. Mandrake manages to decipher the code from the General's papers. Unfortunately, one of the planes is damaged in the attack, and fails to respond. The Soviet Premier, Pistoff, tells Muffley that Russia has recently installed a Doomsday Machine, which will automatically set off all the atom bombs in the world if the Soviet Union is attacked. The bomb is dropped with an American cowboy riding it all the way down and mankind comes to an inglorious end. This is black comedy of the finest kind."
btlqt,"May 24, 2003",9/10,"The first time I watched this movie I was in my high school film class and I couldn't stand it. I though how awful, boring and stupid. However after watching it a second and third time I realize how great it truely is. Every character and line is just perfect and I recommend it to anyone who has a sarcastic side to them!"
vovazhd,"Dec 20, 2007",10/10,"Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb is one of Stanley Kubrick's most critically and publicly acclaimed films. It is a political and social satire about nuclear war. When a United States general orders a nuclear attack on the Soviet Union, the President scrambles to cancel the attack and mutually work things out with the Soviet Union. Negotiations seem to work, until it is realized that there is a Doomsday Device implemented to automatically counter-attack any nuclear hits. Needless to say, things become complicated.The cast is one of the greatest strengths of the film; all the characters are finely crafted and acted flawlessly. Peter Sellers does his legendary performance in three roles (Dr. Strangelove, the President, and Group Captain Mandrake). I do wish that Dr. Strangelove had more screen time; seeing that he was the title character, I expected a bigger influence from him onto the plot. Mandrake was a solid comedy character and the President had a believable, political image. Performances from other actors were also great. George C. Scott as General Turgidson was commendable; his paranoia and fights with the ambassador were classic. Slim Pickens was simply fantastic as the bomber pilot Major Kong, seething with a heavily pro-American mindset.The technical aspects of Dr. Strangelove are also a strong point. The camera angles and cinematography are excellent. The scenes all have the same dark comedy mood in them. Although there was extensive dialog, it never felt overwhelming. The decision to use ""When Johnny Comes Marching Home"" as music for the bomber scenes (with no music used elsewhere) was a good choice. There are many nuances that fill even the smallest holes in the movie, and each character is meticulously detailed.The message is perhaps the most important part of the film, especially when focusing in the context of its release date (during the height of the Cold War). It is basically a satire of mutual destruction, but carries other intriguing implications. There is a lot of sexual imagery, although it is hidden as a second layer to the main plot (although it is mentioned in Dr. Strangelove's ending speech). The whole conclusion was epic and hilarious, and wraps things up just like it should.Dr. Strangelove is a masterpiece that is rightly praised. In my opinion, it is Kubrick's second best film, and perhaps the greatest comedy movie ever."
Movie Mac,"Jan 18, 2001",10/10,"I laughed from the sheer fact that this film was bringing to the surface things I had known for years. A film like this should not be taken seriously quite simply because it evokes such strange insights that after you've seen it, you'd better bury them all again or a demented monster will emerge. But, god, is it funny!Stanley Kubrick follows his own code of originality. His films are meant to be original ways of looking at the world. They are not designed to be pieces of entertainment. He is like the most art house of all Hollywood directors. He has this inane ability to allow people to take things seriously, whether it be about a doomsday device or a bunch of monkeys bashing skeletons with a bone. Let's face it. If Kubrick hadn't directed those films, without the symbolisim he applies, they would have been absolute messes of gargantuan proportions.Dr. Strangelove is the most insane, stupid idea. It's a spoof movie. It's like the works of the Zucker/Abrams/Zucker company or the Austin Powers movies. The ideas evoked are just as silly. But Kubrick knows how to direct an idea like this. His genius makes this not only watchable, but one the best films I have ever seen. People underestimate movies like these, because they take well-known cliches and turn them into statling works of originality. Why do you think people like George Lucas, Martin Scorsese, Krzystof Kieslowski and, yes, Stanley Kubrick, have never won an Oscar? The ones who are teased are the ones to watch, I think.One other thing: Peter Sellers. Good god. Who can possibly deny his genius?"

gamester9,"Apr 29, 2002",6/10,"I'll be honest, the only reason I saw this film was because it scored an 8.8 on IMDB (this site). I just got done watching it about 10 minutes ago and I must say that I wasn't overly impressed. Everyone was saying that this is a black comedy and even one person said that it was extremely funny. I don't think I laughed once throughout this film. It did keep my interest because of the actors playing such great roles. George C. Scott has always been a good actor and this movie really is no exception. He played an awesome role. Peter Sellers was fabulous. The story is great, but I think it would have been alot better as a drama then a comedy. I give it a 6 out of 10."
schenkenberg,"Oct 25, 2005",10/10,"Recently I had a great chance to see Stanley Kubrick's classic comedy ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb"". It is based on the novel ""Red Alert"" by Peter George.A crazy American General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) executes a plan which commands the US Air Force to launch atomic bombs at more than 200 Russian targets. The President Merkin Muffley (Peter Sellers) gets very troubled when he learns that the Soviet Union will protect itself against any attack with the Doomsday Machine that brings the 93-years-long nuclear winter to the Earth. The only man who can stop the General is a British 'exchange officer' Lionel Mandrake (Peter Sellers again).The movie was released in the 1960s when the Cold War had become extremely tense. Using the nuclear weapon was not only possible, but even likely to happen. In the times when the whole world is afraid of terrorists and 'evil countries', it is very refreshing to see a comedy about nuclear war. Kubrick combines this serious matter with an absurd plot and a witty dialogue. Colourful characters with strange names make this film hilarious. Sellers also plays Dr. Strangelove, a German nuclear scientist. His performance is absolutely spectacular. The phone negotiations between the president and the Soviet leader is one of the most memorable scenes in the history of film.""Dr. Strangelove"" is a film that you should not miss. It will provide you with the escape to the Cold War and with a lot of laugh."
CinemaSerf,"Jun 1, 2024",7/10,"Just as ""Seven Days in May"" was hitting our screens, Stanley Kubrick used a superbly over-the-top effort from Sterling Hayden to depict a rogue general who has decided to use all the checks and balances in place to defend the United States to his own mischievous advantage and launch a pre-emptive bombing campaign on those pesky ""Ruskies"". It's only his perfectly moustachioed British executive officer ""Mandrake"" (Peter Sellers) who smells a rat, but he is on lockdown in their air force base that is, indeed, being besieged - but not by the ""Reds"". Meantime, the American President (also Sellers) is only just finding out that he's about to start a nuclear war and nobody knows quite how to top it - not even his chief of staff ""Turgidson"" (George C. Scott). A call to his opposite number in the Kremlin reveals that the Soviets haven't been letting the grass grow, and that they have their own shield - and one that's use would make the effects of the Hiroshima bomb look like a damp squib. With all this mistrust and mayhem abounding, is it going to be possible to avert the destruction of humanity? Sellers has multiple parts and carries them out effectively, but it's the support from Hayden, Scott and the gung-ho, yee-ha, merchant ""Maj. Kong"" (Slim Pickens) - in charge of the heavily laden bomber that is likely to stat the conflagration, that demonstrate really entertainingly not just the faults in the whole principle of a paranoia-driven command and control structure, but also of the flaws of human nature when it comes to increasing reliance on technology and automation. The calculating eponymous character, who could have come straight out of a ""Bond"" movie, also quite cleverly points to the provenance of so many of the scientists who supported the West's military programming whilst their historical loyalties were dubious at best. It's only ninety-odd minutes, but packs plenty to think and laugh about as the ridiculousness and seriousness of the scenario are presented satirically and potently, at a time when the cold war was warmer."
daavaofthekeys-1,"Jun 29, 2008",1/10,"OK, let me first say this: I saw this for the first time in 2008. That might have been too late. Much too late. Or maybe not, since some of my all time favorite movies are Mel Brooks early works, Kurosawas, and some Orson Wells.So here is another timeless-classic I have yet to experience. Wow! I practically stared in disbelief through the whole movie. What the hell is this? Is it a comedy? It's not funny (at all). I did not even smile once, was I supposed to? Is it supposed to be funny or serious, because it is neither. It's just super boring and pretty lame and stupid in some regards as well. I think you've got to be a pretty old bastard to fondly remember this one, I am 28, and didn't get a thing. Well, I get the general idea, but it's not really a good subject for a comedy. If they would have treated it seriously, it might have worked, but who knows. I bet the book is better.Maybe it's just me, but I bet none of my friends would like this movie, they would think that I'd lost my marbles if I tried showing it to them. But on IMDb I am clearly in a majority so what are you gonna do? Check it out if you insist, and if you're around my age and have seen a lot of funny comedies and good political thrillers, there's a good chance you'll feel the same (that this movie should have the same placement on IMDb's bottom worst-list!)"
ZombiesIntheSnow,"Mar 2, 2005",10/10,"One thing that always struck me great about Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb. was its genuine humor about the U.S. air force and government! It blends ingenious comedic references with action and war. It also has hilarious war references to certain characters such as ""crout"" as a slang term for Nazi, or German. It's probably one of the best Kubrick films i've seen. I think he's one of the best directors in all time mainly because he can direct a good variety of movies (i.e. A Clockwork Orange, 2001: A Space Odyssey.) Dr. Stranglove or: How i learned to stop worrying and love the bomb is definitely in my opinion his greatest film. The acting is flawless and the characters are played really good (mad props to Peter Sellers, he rules at acting.)I would recommend this movie to anybody who likes GOOD movies. At first i was a little too eager to watch this movie (mostly because all my friends keep telling me it's so great) so i couldn't really concentrate but i eventually got sucked in, hehe. It's also one of those movies that you can watch over and over again without getting bored of it. Some people think it's flawed by the Black and White picture, but i couldn't see it any different then Black and White. Everybody should watch this at least once in their lifetime!"
mail4gus,"Apr 6, 2003",10/10,Kubrik's finest art. Incredible comedy about the cold war and the fear of a massive anhilation of the earth. More even when you think about the events happening at that time. Performance of Peter Sellers is flawless at every character the he played.
Shayshay101,"Jul 26, 2015",9/10,I watched in history class of my junior year of high school and was pleasantly surprised. The move initially didn't interest me much but after the first few minutes I couldn't wait to see what else would happen and went home that day and watched it instead of waiting until history the next day to finish the story. The plot of the movie was hilarious with enough historical background to make it eligible to be watched during history but was interesting and funny enough to make high school students actually want to watch it. While the situations were too over the top to truly have any real historical message the movie was very enjoyable for a classroom of high school juniors son close to summer break.
marissas75,"Sep 30, 2006",10/10,"""Dr. Strangelove"" is a comedy of errors with tragic consequences. It's both a freewheeling satire and a suspenseful story about what happens after the paranoid General Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) oversteps his authority and orders a nuclear attack on Soviet Russia. Little does he know that this will bring the world to the brink of annihilation because the Soviets have created a ""Doomsday Machine."" Disaster is narrowly averted, only to return againAnd yet this is also one of the most uproarious, biting, ironic comedies ever made, a parody of apocalyptic scenarios. The fate of humanity depends on a group of oddball diplomats and soldiers who are obsessed with destroying the ""Russkies,"" mainly, it seems, as a way of compensating for their sexual frustrations. Gen. Ripper is fixated on his ""precious bodily fluids,"" a Texan pilot (Slim Pickens) reads ""Playboy"" in the cockpit, General Buck Turgidson (George C. Scott) gets dirty phone calls in the War Room. The humorthose character names!is gleefully juvenile, but nothing better illustrates the absurdity of war. Hayden, Pickens, and Scott are all very funny, often playing their roles with straight-faced commitment.Peter Sellers excels in his three roles as a common-sensical British officer, the well- intentioned but ineffective American President, and the ex-Nazi mad scientist Dr. Strangelove. The former two characters have some very funny moments, such as Sellers' parody of the British ""jolly good"" stereotype, and the phone conversation where the President treats the Soviet Premier as if he were an obstinate child. However, they are basically ""straight men,"" meant to be more sane and sympathetic than the crazy figures around them. But Sellers pulls out all the stops in creating Strangelove, what with his weird smile, his mangled accent, his misbehaving hand, and the maniacal glint in his eye.Strangelove is actually a pretty minor characterhis first appearance must come about halfway through the movie. His arrival lifts the movie into new heights of absurdity, but it is always lively, sharp, and funny even when Strangelove is not on screen. And although he's not the central character, it's easy to see why the movie is named after him: he's the figure who most completely unites the hilarious with the horrifying."
nisitpav,"Sep 6, 2005",10/10,"Perhaps a comedy is made on purely extravagant levels. In making movies, and, evidently, watching them, I discovered that such pure emotions as: cry, laugh, fright, are quite easy to create. Comedies are made to make us laugh. Think of all the Billy Wilder comedies, like ""Some like it Hot"" and ""The Apartment"", great movies, with sharp, intelligent scripts and a stylish direction. But still, in a film like those, one laughs, but nothing more. There is no deep emotion, no symbolism, no major theme or thematology, and no thinking. In a sense, the only thing that makes us like those movies is the use of humor. Now, when it comes to Dr. Strangelove. What is it that elevates this film from all other comedies: it is not humor, it is wit. Never before have I watched a comedy where I am required to think as well. What I loved about this movie was the little details, the names, for example. Although I love 2001, ACO, Barry Lyndon and Paths of Glory, I think that DrS is the best Kubrick movie ever! Not only the brilliant, flawless script, of so many unexpected twists and turns, but the lovely satirical direction. Every aspect of this film has a humorous symbolic nature, such as the title sequence, with the two planes exchanging fluids. But one can't only view a film, and particularly this film, and like it as it is. One has to consider the time-frame in which it was made. In an era of desperation and general fear of a third world war, Kubrick dared to make fun of it all, reminding people to take it easy, and love the bomb."
