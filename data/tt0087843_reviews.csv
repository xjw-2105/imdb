evanston_dad,"May 22, 2023",8/10,"Oh, how to feel about this movie?I was mostly riveted by it, let's get that out of the way. It's gorgeous to look at with those Sergio Leone compositions, and gorgeous to listen to with that Ennio Morricone score. Like so many of Leone's films, it has a plaintive, nostalgic glow to it that makes you ache emotionally without even knowing exactly what you're aching for.And there's where I get conflicted with this movie. The character created by Robert De Niro is a repulsive human being. He murders, he rapes. The film cannot be forgiven for the way it handles rape. In one instance, the woman treats it like it was a naughty prank and comes back to fondle the rapist and his buddies in a scene played for laughs. In the other instance, the film at least has the decency to make it seem like something traumatic to the woman, but that woman is Elizabeth McGovern, who reappears later in the film and acts like she's full of regret over the relationship she and De Niro were denied, despite the fact that that relationship consisted almost entirely of him just stalking her and then taking her against her will in the back of a car when she tells him she's leaving for California to become an actress. We follow Robert De Niro both as a young man and as an older man looking back ruefully on his life, but we don't sense that he regrets any of the things he actually did. He just regrets what he lost. It's like he's sad that his days of murdering and raping without consequence are over, and that elegiac Sergio Leone tone left me wondering, what exactly are we supposed to be feeling nostalgic about?So I guess I understand both people who think this movie is something great and those who think it's reprehensible. I guess it's proof that things can be many things at once.Grade: A."
zeki-4,"Jan 21, 2020",9/10,"Make sure you watch the 220 minute version which is perfect. The butchered 139 minute version should never have been released and the added faded clips in the much longer 269 minute version aren't worth it.It's not an easy watch. The story builds patiently and jumps back and forth in time, spanning three generations. It's not the usual gangster flick, but a tale of forgiveness, betrayal, greed and nostalgia. The sets, the fantastic score by Morricone, De Niro at the pinnacle of his career.A beautiful epic swan song by the master Sergio Leone this is."
AlsExGal,"Jan 21, 2025",8/10,"Because there is an even longer director's cut and a short 130 minute version which was the version initially released in America, and is incomprehensible.The film traces the lives of four Jewish gangsters from a New York City ghetto through 60 years of 20th century history in an odd way. It focuses on three time periods - 1920 when the gang is in their teens, 1932-1933 as prohibition ends, and 1968 when Noodles (Robert DeNiro) returns to New York as an old man after he gets a letter saying his true identity has been uncovered. Noodles has been living with regret this past 35 years, because he feels responsible for his gang having been killed by the police back in 1933. He wonders if someone is planning to settle an old score with him.The Godfather this is not. There are no family ties binding any of these characters together, and they are extremely unlikeable and only vaguely characterized. Only Noodles is humanized even a little bit, and then he ruins that by turning out to be a rapist as well as covering the requisite thief/murderer territory that comes with being a gangster.What does it do right? The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli captures the gritty vibrancy of New York's Lower East Side, the glitz of the Prohibition era, and the melancholic decay of the 1960s. There is great attention to period detail, from costumes to production design, immersing the viewer in each era. Then there is that memorable score. As for the acting, De Niro shows the versatility that he always does, and James Woods as Noodles' best friend and gangster ally Max plays the part as ambitious and cunning. Plus Woods always injects just a little bit of crazy int his performances.What did it do wrong? Leone's last film has the same problem with editing that Scorsese has had with his later films. It's just too long and has lots of side stories about union bosses and strikes that add nothing to the narrative. Finally, there are a total of two rapes in this film, with one of them actually being played for laughs. Leone did this in ""Duck You Sucker"" and caused me to lose all sympathy for Rod Steiger's character as a result. Does Leone not get how such crimes are received in the United States?Overall this film actually transcends the gangster genre. It's not about family or the gangster lifestyle. It's about the passing of time, guilt/regret, memory, friendship and growing old. It's also just as much a mystery as it is a mafia movie, as there is much debate as to whether or not anything that happens in the 1968 segment is even real or is it a heroin induced dream of Noodles as he tries to forget his part in the death of his friends by getting doped up in an opium den. I'd say - You decide. It could go either way."
A_Different_Drummer,"Nov 6, 2013",10/10,"... Directors of all time. Let's start with a story. Many years ago, when your grandfather was still a boy, a failed, beaten-down actor named Clint Eastwood packed up his horse and saddle (speaking metaphorically here), left Hollywood forever (or so he thought) and headed out to Europe to pick up cash wherever he could. He ended up doing a film in Italy for an almost-unknown director named Sergio Leone and an almost-unknown sound guy named Ennio Morricone. The film was (as history would later record) an ""Italian Western,"" that is, as the iconic western drama was all but disappearing in the US, it was being ""re-imagined"" by Italian writers and directors, and then filmed in Italy, using mainly Italian actors. On the set, Eastwood spoke in English and everyone else spoke in Italian. (Dubbing later fixed all that). Filming now over, Eastwood took his cash and left. Weeks later, in a bar in another part of Europe, he overheard mention that a certain film was the leading box office attraction on the continent. The name sounded familiar but, frankly, during production, a final name for the film he'd just done had not even been selected. He investigated. Yes, this was the film he had just completed, now titled A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS. The rest is history. Sort of. Two sequels were done with Eastwood playing the same character. Monster hits.By this point the critics began to acknowledge not only Clint, but also the man behind the camera, Leone, who was one of the most promising directors of the era. HE DID THINGS WITH THE CAMERA THAT NO ONE HAS DONE BEFORE OR SINCE, especially his use of closeups, especially his ability to match powerful emotional orchestrals to key scenes. The fourth film in the series, done by Leone but by this time lacking Eastwood, was ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST. (Eastwood meanwhile had returned to America as a major celebrity, formed his own production company, Malpaso, and over time became a director as well as the #1 box office star. Over the course of his career, Eastwood subtly voiced his distaste for Leone's work by scrupulously avoiding all Leone's trademark camera angles, even in his westerns!)Back to Leone. While he lent his name to a handful of oddball productions, the last passionate work he left behind as his legacy was this film. OMG. What a film. Showcasing not only Leone's talent behind the camera, but also his musical magic as well as his ability to tell a complex tale like no one before him. It was by and large produced in obscure locations in NA, and the performances of the players, especially James Woods, and also de Niro, could possibly rank even today as the best they have ever given. (Also a performance from a young and charismatic Jennifer Connolly that by itself is worth the price of the ticket)The film is magical. But here is the catch. Very few people have ever seen it. Even people who ""think"" they have seen it, really have not. The studio behind the film went berserk when they saw the length and, fearful of losing dollars when they could be changing reels and selling more tickets, they brought in a butcher to shorten it. Now maybe the new editor was not a butcher by trade, but he was sure one by disposition. The late Roger Ebert said that, in his career, this was the most abusive re-edit he had ever seen. The actual film, the one that Leone left, was not seen until years later when the director's version surfaced. It is astounding. It is magical. It is one of the best films ever made. It is a must see. ((Designated ""IMDb Top Reviewer.""

philip_vanderveken,"Sep 19, 2004",10/10,"Many people compare ""Once Upon a Time in America"" with ""The Godfather"". In my opinion these two movies can't be compared. Both are masterpieces in their own way, but each of them has a different style. You don't compare a Picasso to Michelangelo's Sixteen Chapel either, do you?What is it that makes this movie a masterpiece? Well, first of all there is the director. Sergio Leone is a real master when it comes to creating a special atmosphere, full of mystery, surprises and drama... He's one of the few directors who understands the art of cutting a movie in such a way that you stay focused until the end.The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut.The second reason why this movie is so great is the music. Ennio Morricone, who is seen as the greatest writer of film music ever, did an excellent job. Together with the images, the music speaks for itself in this movie. From time to time there isn't said a word, but the music and the images on their own tell the story. He understood perfectly what Sergio Leone wanted and composed most of the music even before the movie was shot.Last but not least there is also the acting and the script. The actors all did an excellent job. But what else can you expect from actors like Robert De Niro, Joe Pesci... They helped making this movie as great as it is by putting there best effort in it. The script helped them with it. It took twelve years to complete, but it hasn't left any detail untouched. The writers really thought of everything when creating it.I can really recommend this movie to everyone, but especially to people who like the gangster genre. When you want to see the movie, you better be sure that you will have the time for it. This isn't a movie that is finished after 90 minutes. You'll have to be able to stay focused during 3 hours and 47 minutes, which will certainly not be easy during the first 20 to 30 minutes. Some scenes at the beginning only make sense when you have seen the end of the movie. But when you are able to stay focused, you'll find this one of the best movies you've ever seen. I certainly did and I rewarded it with a well deserved 10/10."
bob the moo,"Sep 21, 2002",N/A,"Noodles returns to the New York of his youth in response to an invitation to come and meet.  His return is his first for half his life having fled New York to avoid being killed for ratting out his gangster friends.  His return is mysterious and he doesn't know why he has been summoned.  His return sparks memories of his childhood and adulthood growing up in the area with his friends and eventual business partners.A three and a half hour movie may not be everyone's idea of fun.  On the other hand, many people who see a running time over 180 minutes immediately assume it is an epic that must be `the greatest film ever made'. In this case the time is worth the effort, even if it a little luxurious and overlong.  The plot is too sweeping to go into detail, encompassing 30 years in the main part and a further 30 by way of suggestion.  Basically it comes down to Noodles memories of his life when he was growing up, up till the point we find him now, as an old man with little but those memories.  As a story this is moving and involving.  There are maybe too many lingering shots of Noodles staring into the distance but these don't feel as lazy as they have in other films.Noodles past and the misery of him now is involving enough, but the main thread is Noodle's past, both childhood and adulthood in crime and love. The sheer detail that must be covered is well done.  The film not only includes many major events but also minor things like the scene where the boy is tempted to eat a cream cake!  This mix is very rewarding and makes it feel a lot more detailed than it actually is.  The story is a real feel of several generations of crime and is very involving.The cast make the film and hold the attention during the scenes that are longer than they should be etc.  De Niro convinces as youth and bitter old man and holds the eye easily as both.  Woods is much better than usual even if his character is the same.  McGovern is good considering she has a minor role, but as an `old woman' she looks the same as she was when she was young.  Actors like Williams, Aiello, Forsythe, Hayden etc easily fill out the gangster etc roles without falling into cliché or caricature.  Just as rewarding are the child actors who carry the first hour of the film.  Not only do they actually look like the actors in question, but they also do a very good job.  There are some bum notes but they do mange the innocence of youth with the emotional basis for the rest of the film.The direction is excellent  both gritty streets but with an affectionate slant of Noodles' memories.  The direction is made almost perfect by the use of Ennio Morricone's score.  It is at once haunting but slightly warming and `Debra's theme' has become one of my favourite tunes.  The overall effect is one of a rich tapestry that eventually weaves into a very personal epic of regret and loss.An excellent film that deserves to be recognised as both one of the great crime epics but also a personal and moving film."
RobertCartland,"Jan 17, 2000",10/10,"This film is a profound expression of truth regarding friendship and betrayal.  Noodles, played by Robert De Niro and Scott Tiler (during childhood), is a simple man and a thug with one credo: you can battle the entire world but you never betray a friend.  During the course of this film we experience various pieces of Noodles's life, from childhood, through young adulthood and old age. We learn what happens to his friends, his foes and the love of his life, Deborah.  The time span considered is long, including Noodles's childhood shortly after the turn of the century, through the prohibition era, and finally the 1960's.The film is about relationships; the many years Noodles spends away from his friends receive only a cursory mention. The film, like life and memories, unfolds slowly and reflectively. Sergio Leone's cuts are long and each scene is beautifully amplified my Ennio Morricone's haunting score.  The story is not told chronologically. Instead, the chapters of the story are slowly revealed like pieces of a great jigsaw puzzle. Each delicious piece might make us laugh, or cry, or smile, or feel shock.  But, as each piece falls into place, a mystery unfolds. When the final piece is revealed, the true essence of the story becomes clear and a sad and beautiful tapestry comes into view.This film is a true masterpiece, expressing a profound statement about friendship and betrayal, with fantastic acting, writing, directing and music.  There is a shortened, two-and-a-half-hour version of the film released that is a disaster.  It is like trying to understand a jigsaw puzzle with half of the pieces missing. The original four-hour film can be viewed and enjoyed several times and each time the viewer will see something new."
oldguybc,"Jan 11, 2005",10/10,"This movie was a masterpiece. It ranks as one of the very best in film history, if not the best. At Cannes people yelled and screamed, couldn't believe just how good it was. The profound atrocity was a combination of two completely brainless acts, the first being Zack Stienberg's hatchet job for US release, supposedly requested by either Warner Bros or The Ladd Company (one blames the other now) and the second was the lack of anyone (and everyone)to post anything in this great film for Academy Award consideration, of which probably as many as 14 nominations and 4 sure- fire Oscars went down the toilet.These atrocities were perpretrated, I believe, with two reasons in mind, the first to preserve the dim hope of ""The Killing Fields"" (Daly & Semel's baby) of garnering any awards... and second, to try to boost up the non- foreign chances. Warner Bros knew just how good it was, that goes without saying. The problem was... they already had their share of cash cows and they wanted a real star- studded showpiece to point at. The small minds already had their showpiece but, alas, it was an ""eye- tallyan"" flick with a producer/director who didn't communicate well. The hatchet job was carefully planned, I believe... the so- called ""sneak preview"" was done in Canada and not well received, probably due to the fact that the sound system was over- amped and the film 'broke' 3 or 4 times during the showing, what a farce! The awards snub started with the GGs and carried right thru. What a myriad of stupid and utterly pointless decisions! Must have literally tore Leone's heart out when he learned what they had done.Morricone's score was a sure- thing Oscar, no question about it. DeNiro and maybe even Woods would have fought it out for best actor, Tuesday Weld as supporting actress, any one of 4 or 5 other supporting actors & actresses, most notably William Forsythe, cinematography, film editing, the list goes on & on... (best picture...Amadeus???? give me a break!!) Just what in the hell were they thinking?Saw it in a theater 20 years ago and then again on TV about 1998 and finally in its correct format(on DVD) about two years ago and again last week at a friend's house. Stirred up all those angry thoughts all over again... sorry about that, getting' old & crotchety."
Quinoa1984,"Oct 19, 2003",10/10,"It's been said that when one watches a ""spaghetti"" western (one of the ""Man with no name"" films with Clint Eastwood) filmmaker Sergio Leone's trademark cinema style and flair for clear storytelling is instantly recognizable. This is no truer than in his most ambitious effort, Once Upon a Time in America, in which his usage of close-ups, concise camera movement, sound transitions and syncs, and the sudden change in some scenes from tenderness to violence. And, he pulls it off without making the viewer feel dis-interested. Of course, it's hard to feel that way when watching the cast he has put together; even the child actors (one of which a young Jennifer Connelly as the young Deborah) are believable. Robert De Niro projects his subtitles like a pro, with his occasional outburst in the right place; James Woods gives one of his first great performances as Max; Elizabeth McGovern is the heart of the film; and Joe Pesci should've had more than just a one scene appearance, thought it's still good.It's a story of life-long friends, in the tradition of the Godfather movies with obvious differences, and the story cuts back and forth to Noodles (De Niro) in his old age returning from exile, looking back on his childhood in Brooklyn, his rise to power with his partners, and the twists come quite unexpectedly. The pace is slow, but not detrimental, and it gives the viewer time to let the emotions sink in. The story is also non-linear, and yet doesn't give away facts to the viewer- this is something that more than likely influenced Tarantino (and many others) in style. By the end, every detail that has mounted up makes the whole experience rather fulfilling, if not perfect. Finally, I'd like to point out the exceptional musical score. Ennio Morricone, as it says on this site, has scored over four hundred films in forty years, including Leone's movies. This would have to be, arguably, one of his ten best works- his score is equally lively, saddened, intense, and perhaps majestic for a gangster epic. Overall, it's filled with the same spirit Leone had in directing the picture, and it corresponds beautifully- there are some scenes in this film that would simply not work without the strings. Grade: A"
tgdane,"Jan 6, 2002",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America, which bookends Once Upon a Time in the West as director Sergio Leone's best work, is a powerhouse of a movie. A gangster epic told in a very different style than the standard of the genre, The Godfather, it is in some ways (at least to this viewer) even more emotionally compelling. Although the movie was sabotaged upon release by an edited studio version eliminating about 40% of its original length, the version now available for rental is thankfully the nearly 4 hour version intended by Leone.  The story is at essence a basic one about friendship among thieves, telling the story of a group of Jewish kids in New York near the turn of the century who grow up to become powerful and ruthless mobsters, while maintaining (or trying to) their bond with one another.  As was most famously done in the taxi scene between Rod Steiger and Marlon Brando in On The Waterfront, the movie again makes the point that bad people can have good aspects to them, such as loyalty, devotion, and even love. I think this movie includes one of Deniro's best roles, and far and away James Woods best film work. The score, by arguably the greatest movie composer of all time, Ennio Morricone, is incredibly haunting in its beauty and sadness (with no fewer than three separate themes that are breathtakingly beautiful).  The non-chronological manner in which the story is told results in a wonderfully effective narrative device:  the movie begins and ends with the same scene.  The first time you see the scene, it is a frantic jumble, without meaning or context, and you do not know why it is so important.  When the scene recurs at the end of the film, everything has become clear, and the scene has an incredible poignancy and sadness to it:  although it occurs in the middle of events chronologically, you realize that, in a real sense, life stopped at this point for one of the film's main characters.  There is no other event that matters anymore to him. This is not a simple movie, and it merits repeated viewings.  Indeed, in my view one cannot fully appreciate the greatness of the film until the second viewing, when the full story is known, and the  events of the film resonate with knowledge of where they ultimately, and tragically, lead."
goggy turk,"Dec 25, 2000",10/10,"I decided, on Christmas Eve, to reacquaint myself with an old friend- Sergio Leone's heavyweight gangster epic, which I had previously watched in two sittings, 10 years previously, at Uni.I was rewarded with a movie of tremendous vision and creative style as well as emotional integrity. When you take an idiosyncratic, brilliant, stylish director like Leone, his composer counterpart, Morricone, and a cast including two of the foremost actors of their generation (de Niro and Woods) then you have an idea of the kind of quality this film has. In fact, the only gangster movie(s) I've seen that match it are the first two Godfathers (in fact Leone almost directed those too... now that would have been interesting).In contrast to earlier Leone Westerns, the characters are more fully developed- although the detachment of the characters in these movies made for a more rollercoaster, loose style of cinema, no one was ever going to win an award appearing in one, although they were all great movies.Although I could tell I was in a Leone movie almost from the beginning, what was different was the inner lives of the characters dictated the way the plot flowed in a pleasing way. I also think that the performance de Niro put in was the best of any film I've seen him in, and that includes any Scorcese picture. To make the audience actually care about a character who does such evil (including raping the woman he loves) is a towering achievement. The apparent effortlessness with which he achieves this is a mark of true greatness. Leone's style of filmmaking, with its long silences and pauses and (in this case) slow pace suit de Niro's style of acting perfectly. It's a real pity that they never had the chance to work together again.I think this a great film, and, at 3 3/4 hours, it kept me at least interested and often gripped all the way through. Why are Hollywood studios scared of movies like this? Some people out there love them."
guyzradio,"Oct 18, 2018",6/10,"Perusing Netflix, I recognized this movie title and the names Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone; I particularly enjoyed the music of Cinema Paradiso, also the work of Morricone. The line-up of actors pulled me right in, but to what? After watching for a little while, I looked up the movie and noted how 10 hours of film were sliced and diced to a disastrous 2h 19m for US release, whereas the 3h 49m release was the one to make everything right. Well, at least I had that going for me.At the end, it was still a disappointment. A movie that forces you to pay fanatic attention to detail to ""get it"" is not the product of good direction. It is the result of a riding on one's own name to varnish a deeply flawed product as ""art."" Even at 3h 49m, continuity suffered. The flashback method of story telling was clumsy and not handled nearly as smoothly as in its inspiration, Godfather II. The fact that these were kids from a Jewish neighborhood was inconsequential. Things happen in the movie often for no apparent reason and go nowhere, the opening 10 or 15 minutes being a prime example. Even the music of Ennio Morricone seems worn out by the end, as the same theme repeats throughout scenes where it seems misplaced or simply gets in the way.You might will dismiss this review as the ramblings of someone who isn't sophisticated enough to realize what a masterpiece this really is. My guess is there is a coherent, thought-provoking story somewhere among the frames that made it to the screen and what was left on the cutting room floor. This still isn't it. To suggest that less than a point separates this move from The Godfather I just doesn't pass the sniff test."
dicknerd,"Sep 3, 2024",5/10,"I invested nearly four hours into watching this movie, largely based on an IMDb rating of 8.4 and having skimmed user reviews and seeing headlines that used descriptors of ""best ever"", ""epic"", ""masterpiece"", ""wonderful"", ""profound"", ""superb"", and ""beautiful"". Now usually I find that my taste in movies aligns to the IMDb reviews, so away I went. Mistake. After around 2 hours I was still quite invested and enjoying it, but then....not so much....at all. The pace is slow, the musical score by Ennio Morricone is indeed classical but at times seems set a mood that is incongruent with the plot and characters, especially towards the end when Noodles and Deborah are looking at each other over soft romantic music, considering the atrocious way that he assaulted her. So by that point the score was just annoying me.By the end I was wondering what robust conversations must have been had when it was edited multiple times to run between 6 and 2 hours before deciding on just under 4 hours. At least I didn't have to sit through the 6 hour version. I mean if you're studying film and want to write a dissertation on the movie and the acting ability of DeNiro and Woods, there's lots of material there to work with, but if you just want to enjoy the plot and engage with the characters, then not so much. After 3 hours and 49 minutes I thought that was a waste of time."
jeanpaul-3,"Oct 29, 1999",N/A,"This is, for me, one of the finest examples of cinematic art. It isn't a simple, cut-n-dried 90 minute little package that gets wrapped up with a pretty bow at the end. You get pulled in by the enigmatic opening that unwinds the threads of the story to be found later. For many people having half an hour of purely visual story telling, of stories that are only mysteries at that point, before anything becomes truly linear is difficult to follow and discourages to many people. Our own memories are only snippets that only become linear as we concentrate on scenes from our lives. Once Upon a Time in America is like that as we follow Noodles through the `significant' part of his life - the times that formed him. When the story actually starts, we meet the girl that he always loved but could never have.David `Noodles' Aaronson (DeNiro) was a kid on the very mean streets of Brooklyn when organized crime was born in America and he grew into and out of it. That's the simplest synopsis of the plot. The reality is that this isn't a movie about gangsters. Being a gangster is the easiest way for Noodles to survive and get ahead, but it also alienates and ruins his one love. Whenever he is close to giving himself to Deborah he always gets pulled back into the gang, in some form or another.DeNiro's portrayal is of a gangster, through and through, who also has a conscience that, while not preventing him from being a ruthless killer, rules his life with regret, remorse and guilt. Leone takes a bit of poet/historic license by showing the Brooklyn Bridge being built in the background (the bridge had been built 40 years before), but it symbolizes Noodles' own growth. When the bridge is just pilings and incomplete towers, Noodles is just forming his future. By the time the bridge is complete, Noodles is nothing but a gangster and the bridge is majestic. When he returns 35 years later our view of the bridge is from under a freeway -- the world has moved along, but the bridge and Noodles are just as they were.The length: If you're looking for a brief distraction that you'll barely remember 30 minutes later, this isn't the movie for you. However, if you are prepared and able to be undistributed for the nearly 4 hours that this film uses to compress a lifetime -- you will be rewarded with many facets of thought and examination."
sebwalrusfr,"Mar 25, 2006",10/10,"Simply the best movie ever made. Dot.Life. Love. Friendship. Nostalgia. Souvenirs. Childhood. Adulthood. Betrayal. Children's dreams. Psychology. Sex. Manhood. Womanhood. Romance. Illusions. Acting. Ambition. Glory. Fate. Masochism. Sadism. History. Death...Some even say it's a movie on Italian Mafia...This movie is to cinema what ""A day in the life"" is to modern music : an evocation of what life is, in a global approach, with its darker sides and its epic moments, and in the end everything is vain and you die. Magnified as always by the superb work of Ennio Morricone, and the perfect acting of De Niro and Woods, it was for Sergio Leone THE movie of his life, his long time cherished plan, his masterpiece to end with. Additionally, it has become THE movie of the 20th century."
milanbaros_948,"Aug 28, 2005",10/10,"Leone's beautiful vision met with an epic story to create one of the most beautiful movies of all time. Four hours long but time melts away as you are transported into New York. In a movie where the importance of time is stressed, and how it should not be wasted, it is pleasing that this considerably long movie does not waste, rather enhance your time. Instead of regretting lost time we are instead left exhilarated and wondering. Performances all-round are fantastic right from the child performances, 'Noodles, I slipped' to the aged De Niro with a look in his eye that he has seen it all before. His weariness is astonishingly realistic and applause should be directed at De Niro and his method. A true masterpiece."
murtaza_mma,"Oct 23, 2011",10/10,"In order to cater to their everlasting lust for making money, the movie production studios have always endorsed the motto of quid pro quo – ""A favor in return of another"". Every movie-maker capable enough to be called an auteur—by the virtue of his knack for eccentricity and novelty—has had to borne the brunt of this naked opportunism: be it D.W. Griffith, Charles Chaplin, Orson Welles or Stanley Kubrick. Sergio Leone too had to pay collaterally by having to make five Westerns in order to get funding for his dream project, Once Upon a time in America (OUTA). OUTA is a masterpiece of epic proportions and is consummate on almost every level. The uniqueness of the movie is such that it can be looked upon from various angles with each perspective adding immensely to movie's substance and profundity. The movie not only transcends genres by making simultaneous forays into the realms of Crime, Drama, Mystery, Suspense and Fantasy, but also crosses on several occasions the fine line that separates Dream from Reality.At the beginning of his career, Leone got widely proclaimed as a master of technique and style as he added new dimensions to cinematography and screenplay. Leone's directorial debut was 'A Fistful of dollars'. Movie's success was marred when Akira Kurosawa sued the production house for plagiarizing Yojimbo. Leone bounced back with 'For a Few More Dollars'. He single-handedly reinvented the Western genre by providing a completely different perspective to the Old West, which was hitherto portrayed as the battle ground for the epic battle of virtue versus vice in the backdrop of chivalry and machismo. With 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly', Leone perpetuated what would become his trademark: Spaghetti Western. Leone's distinctive style included juxtapositions, super close- ups, long continuous shots, and the rotating camera shots. Leone's collaboration with master-composer Ennio Morricone gave cinema some of its most mellifluous compositions. Once Upon a Time in the West elevated Leone from the position of a showman to a serious movie-maker—an auteur capable of much profound works. Leone refused a multitude of projects, including the opportunity to direct 'The Godfather', in a bid to realize his dream project.OUTA is an epic crime saga based on the lives of Jewish gangsters from their humble childhood in the ghettos of New York to their rise in world of organized crime. 'Noodles', 'Patsy', 'Cockeye', and little Dominic struggle as street kids in the East Side of Manhattan in the early 1920s. They work for 'Bugsy', a local gangster, until they meet 'Max' and decide to start an independent operation, triggering a series of incidents which changes their lives for ever. Robert De Niro as 'Noodles' gives one of the most subtle performances of his career. James Woods is chillingly menacing as 'Max'. Young 13-year-old Jennifer Connelly as 'Deborah' serves as a pulchritudinous delight for the sour eyes, and I say this as a testament to her ethereal, nymphean charm that was evident even at such a tender age. The rest of the cast gives a great support to the actors in lead with special mention of Elizabeth McGovern, James Hayden and Joe Pesci. The music is composed by Leone's long-time collaborator Ennio Morricone, who once again works his magic by creating music that is so plaintively divine that even Mozart would be proud of it.The film poignantly explores the themes of love, lust, friendship, greed, betrayal and loss of innocence in the backdrop of the 20th century America. For the European release, Leone cut down his original version to 229 minutes to appease the distributors. However, for the US release, OUTA was ignominiously edited down to 139 minutes by the muddle-headed studio personnel against the director's wishes. In this short version, the flashback narrative was omitted as the scenes were put back in the chronological order. Many of the movie's most beautiful shots are not present in the shorter version, including the nigh magical sequence in which time-switching is indicated by the conjuration of a Frisbee. Movie's abysmal show in the US is attributed to this sabotage. Leone was reportedly heartbroken by the American cut, and never made another film again.The dreamlike screenplay of OUTA gives it a lyrical, almost hypnotic feel. OUTA is a tapestry of highly complex mesh work: the story depicts the lives of same individuals across three different timelines. The time-switching techniques used in the movie are so effective that the switching seems absolutely seem-less. The mystical ringing tone that the viewer gets to hear in the beginning of the movie provides a great subterfuge in unison with the dream-like finale, and adds surrealistic elements to the movie by raising doubts that the events depicted in the movie could well have been a part of a drug-induced dream that Noodles would have been experiencing under the hypnotic effect of opium. The movie has a multitude of unforgettable moments, which can be cherished again and again with the same levels of indulgence. The sequence in which little Dominic—caught between the want to satiate his newly attained puberty and the fundamental urges—buys a pastry to charm a neighborhood girl, but succumbs to the universal temptation and ends up eating it himself is pure gold. The scene which depicts Robert De Niro molesting his childhood love represents cinema at its most macabre. The make-up, set designing and costume designing are all top- notch. The make-up artists have gone about their business with such meticulousness that the actors seem to genuinely represent their character's age in each era.Overall, OUTA is a testament to Sergio Leone's dedication to the free spirit of Art. It succeeds at multiple levels and makes the viewer go through an entire gamut of emotions, keeping him engaged throughout. It is sanguinary and is surfeited with blood-cuddling violence that makes it unsuitable for the weak-hearted. OUTA, however, is as a must for the enthusiasts of the genre and the cineastes worldwide. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
ccthemovieman-1,"Nov 26, 2005",8/10,"This Godfather-type film was done by Sergio Leone, of spaghetti-western fame, so you know you will see and experience several of his trademarks. Namely: (1) a lot of facial closeups; (2) some slow-motion or slow-moving dramatic scenes; (3) good overall photography and (4) a unique soundtrack.The period sets here are magnificent. You get a real feel of the time, whether it's 1910, 1933 or 1967. The colors are awash in blacks, browns and grays and the DVD brings all these out very well, especially considering the film is over 20 years old.Despite some of Leone's slow moments, this is a fascinating film to watch for the story, too. There are numerous memorable scenes, some of them involving some downright shocking violence, even for today's movies. However, the amount of violence is less than what you see today.The movie also sports an interesting twist near the end involving the two major characters, played by Robert De Niro and James Woods. The story is not always clear, either, so be prepared to be possibly confused about a few things....at least on the first viewing. Confused or not, this film always is fascinating to view, especially with intense actors such as the two men just mentioned, along with Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Joe Pecsi, Burt Young, Treat Williams and more.The child actors in here take up almost half the movie and are excellent. What an injustice they don't receive any publicity for their acting, especially the kids who played De Niro and Woods as youngsters. One of the girls has become a famous adult actress: Jennifer Connelly. She was 12 years old in this film and was already alluring.This is Godfather-type crime movie that ranks right up there with that famous film, not taking a back seat to it at all."
boardertrash,"Oct 25, 2021",9/10,"You know what, I have to eat humble pie here because once upon a time, when I first saw this film as a young adult I didn't think much of it.I'd have reviewed it saying it was overly long, not enough action and a bit boring.How times have changed! Where once I'd have rated Goodfellas was the better film I now most definitely think otherwise. Don't get me wrong GF is a great film but it's not one of the greats, I think Goodfellas is more of a quick gangster fix, definitely the first of a modern breed of blunt instrument Gangland films, ones which are full of brash characters, lots of gruesome killing and a hit parade soundtrack.Once upon a time in America is the opposite, a carefully crafted and honed (near) masterpiece of cinematic character storytelling. You feel part of what you're watching, transported back to a different era. Just half a step behind The Godfather in my estimation.This is a joy to watch again and no doubt I'll watch it many more times. Ignore the negative reviews stating it's boring, no doubt mainly Millennials with the attention span of a Gnat."
highlander-22844,"Apr 25, 2020",6/10,"Beautifully shot, casted, acted film that the director and cast clearly had a genuine passion for but it's just too long, muddled and bloated.
Regarding the length of the Directors Cut - Lawrence Of Arabia and The Good the Bad and the Ugly are two of my favourite films and both are long in length so before anyone accuses me of having a short attention span that is not the problem here but some major cutting in the editing would have done this film a world of good."
davesraves,"May 12, 2024",1/10,"Well, here we are in the low rating filter and it really is a deep relief to me that at least a few people share my view of this dreadful mess, yet the insistent screech of acclaim reaches down and makes itself known in the downvotes every bad review receives. Not only is this film almost universally respected, acclaimed, held up as high art, it appears to be beloved?! Tell people you hate it in any online discussion space and they will absolutely dogpile you with hotly offended ridicule.A lifelong fan of the genre, I sat down to watch this thing for the first time maybe 20 years back, full of excitement, anticipating an instant love affair and many many happy rewatches.I was surprised by my own strong negative reaction, the sinking sensation at one dead scene after another, my intense irritation at the leaden pace and awful script, my revulsion at the meaningless sordidness, my growing shocked realisation that it wasn't going to somehow turn it all around in the third act and deliver magic. This is it? THIS?I told myself. Well, maybe it's a grower, maybe I'm immature, maybe I'm being too picky?So I went back and tried it again, and a third time, and my feelings were and are exactly the same. I despise this film and I believe I always will."
tenco,"May 16, 1999",N/A,"Sergio Leone's films are all love letters to America, the American dreams of an Italian who grew up at the movies, who apprenticed with Wyler, and Aldrich, signed himself Bob Robertson, and gave us Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Charles Bronson as we know them.  Sadly, America didn't always repay the compliment.  Leone's were ""spaghetti westerns"", money makers to be sure, but deemed  disrespectful of the great tradition of Ford, Walsh and Hathaway. Many critics and Holllywood insiders called his earlier Eastwood films cynical and violent bottom-line commercial exploitation.  By the time that they caught on to Leone's genuine popular appeal, the director had already moved on.  And, his Once Upon a Time in the West was damned as pretentious, bloated, self-indulgent: an art film disguised as a Western, the Heaven's Gate of its day. That film's canny blend of pop appeal and pure cinematic genius gradually dawned on the powers that be (or were), and helped give rise to the renaissance of American filmmaking in the early seventies. It is worth noting that The Godfather could have been made by Leone, had he chosen. Leone had been pitching a gangster film that would encompass generations, for a generation or two, himself.  Rather than do the Puzo version finally thrown back at him, he waited an eternity, and finally realized this, his last finished project.  That ellipse of a decade or so between conception and completed movie is paralleled in the film, itself, by Robert De Niro's (""Noodles'"") opium dream of the  American twentieth century, its promises, and betrayals.  Naturally, Leone was betrayed, once again, himself, by America, and this truly amazing film, with its densely multi-layered, overlapping flashback structure was butchered upon its release, becoming a linear-plotted sub-Godfather knockoff in the process. Luckily, the critics had grown up enough in the meantime to finally get a glimmering of what Leone was up to, and demand restitution.  Very few saw it properly in theaters, but the video version respects the director's intentions, more or less.  Ironically, Leone had foreseen television screen aspect ratios as determining home viewing of the future, and abbreviated his usual wide screen format for this movie, so this most troubled last project was the first released on video to most properly  resemble the true cinematic experience.  For diehard fans of the Eastwood westerns impatient with this at first, watch those movies till you want and need more.  This will eventually get to you.  For art film fanatics who don't get the earlier Leones, travel in the reverse direction, and you will be pleasantly surprised.  This is the movie that Leone spent a decade conceiving. It will deliver for decades of viewing to come."
Cunctator,"Aug 1, 2004",10/10,"This is one of the greatest stories ever told. Every time I see this wonderful movie I enjoy its special blend of melancholic romanticism and bitter, ruthless violence.Once upon a Time in America is neither fast-paced nor impeccably plotted, and it doesn't make you feel good, right then and there. The hero wins nothing, only grows old. This movie isn't easy to love. You see it once and you start asking yourself why Noodles doesn't make it back to New York before the late Sixties. How come he doesn't care about his money enough to track down his enemies. If it's really possible never to hear about Deborah becoming a famous actress and a star. These are the plot's shortcomings, the creases that should be ironed out. On the other hand, some character contradictions can be explained. You know Noodles dug a deep hole and buried himself in it for 35 years, because he tells you and you also get it from the tone of his voice and the way he moves. Then you see him young again, rejected by the only woman he's passionately loved. His woman, as Max still calls her in their final conversation. You see Noodles lose the friends who shaped his entire world and his very existence, and bear that responsibility upon his shoulders. He's alone and weary. He feels he can't shake off his ghosts with a gun in his hand, having had his fill of killing.Max always surprises Noodles. He soon learns what makes him tick and is secretly in competition with his partner in crime. Max's feelings haven't been straightforward since the day the two met. He terribly needs to put his life as a gangster behind him, to find success in the legitimate world. On the contrary, Noodles couldn't care less about all that. Our romantic hero is reasonably happy with what he's got or, better yet, he doesn't think there's a lot more out there for him to take. He's only aware that he can't have Deborah, the girl who never ages in his loving eyes. Nothing would ease that pain. Then he's cheated out of the money by Max, the sad, sad traitor. When the two guys meet for the last time, it's hard to say which one is the loser. Max has suffered more. He's horribly missed his old friend and now needs to show him his guilt and accept his penance. At that point, though, Noodles cannot be forced to rewrite his life history. He doesn't believe another version of the truth will help him. ""We're old men, Senator Bailey, all we have is our memories. If we lose that, we'll have nothing left.""We just learned a hard lesson. As our past poisons our present, truth doesn't have roots on firm ground. We'll live with sorrow and there's not a lot we can do about it. Are we ready to accept it?"
Xstal,"Sep 28, 2020",6/10,"It takes forty minutes to develop a sustaining head of steam and then proceeds to interject sub stories and plots that do little more than extend the feature to its epic length. I watched this a couple of times when it came out on VHS in the 80s and the only bit I could recall was the baby lottery, either confirms my senility or that it's just not that memorable a movie. Yes, the performances are great, believable and earnest enough but ultimately they fail to distract from the marathon placed before you and the stamina expected to make it to the end."
DrLenera,"Sep 13, 2005",N/A,"Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It's nearly four hours long,and demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.Reminiscent at times of some very old gangster films such as The Roaring Twenties,one will find almost every gangster movie cliché one can find-one can imagine Leone half remembering bits and pieces from films he saw as a youth. However,he never glamourises his protagonists-he may dare us to like Robert De Niro's 'Noodles'-a murderous thug and rapist who always seems to make the wrong decisions-but that's different from glamourising him. The notorious rape scene is all the more hard to watch because its painful to watch Noodles try to destroy himself and his girlfriend by going through with it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past. Therefore,starting in mid-plot in the 1930s,than flashing back and forth in time,was the right choice {if initially confusing!}. This is the culmination of Leone's increasing interest in the flashback structure-think especially of the parallel story told in A Fistful of Dynamite's flashbacks.There is action,but it's mostly quick and brutal,and there is also humour,such as a very funny scene set to Rossini's Thieving Magpie where the gangsters are loose in a hospital filled with babies. However,the broody,melancholic tone never really goes away,and towards the end,the film grinds to a virtual halt. Be warned,there is no action climax,just a series of somewhat oblique dialogue scenes and revelations.The expected Leone flamboyancy is hardly to be found,but the film still often soars most when dialogue is kept to a minimum and Ennio Morricone's gorgeous music takes over. Some of the most brilliant scenes just consist of Noodles seeing and reflecting. In one especially effective and poignant scene near the end,an old Noodles is leaving his love Deborah as her achingly sad theme plays,and he sees her son,who is the spitting image of,well,I try to avoid spoilers! As the music changes into the still sad but more majestic main theme,the camera slowly zooms,as it often does,into Noodles' sad eyes. We go to what is initially a blur,until we realise it's curtains. The person who holds the key to all this appears,like a ghost,through the curtains and goes onto a balcony,from where he sees the same 'son' with a girlfriend. Sheer brilliance,and not a gun in sight!Of course De Niro is great,but he's obviously very restrained and reflective. It's James Woods who really dominates,so dynamic here,this should have made him a big star. One must also mention Tonni Delli Colli,who photographs three time periods with slightly different hues but still subtly.Leone's original cut was five hours and if you want to be picky there are holes in the plot. Leone leaves a great many things ambiguous,but shouldn't all great art ask questions? Once Upon A Time In America is not necessarily easy viewing,but it IS great art,the final statement of one of the best filmmakers of all time."
Eye_of_Horus_,"Aug 17, 2001",10/10,"This Movie is absolutely amazing (only the long Version). I can't believe what I see, this Masterpiece of Sergio Leone is more than underrated (the most underrated Movie I have ever seen).What are the Important Things in a Movie ? Let me tell you, because I think this Movie has it all.An Amazing Camera work, the Music from Morricone is Godlike, the Story shows highly claim, the Actors Performance is Perfect, the Dialogues are brilliant.I watched the Godfather and rated 9/10 but Once upon a Time in America is much better. I would give this Movie 100/10.Enjoy this Masterpiece and you never forget what you see in almost 4 hours. The Pictures, the Dialogues and the Music of this Movie will solid burns in your Brain and reminds you from Time to Time at this Epic Movie.THIS IS THE MOVIE OF MY LIFE."
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 9, 2011",10/10,"I have seen many movies, good and bad. One thing for certain, Once Upon a Time in America is more than good. It is amazing, a true milestone in the crime drama genre. The cinematography, images, scenery and locations are all superb and quite sweeping, while Ennio Morricone's score ranks up there with his very best. While the film clocks in at nearly four hours long, it never feels boring to me while the pace is quite elegiac everything else just compels you. I will admit, this is another film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it.Sergio Leone's direction is also superb, the story is always compelling and rich and the dialogue is very thought-provoking. The characters are wonderful if different. Unlike The Godfather(not a bad thing by the way), Once Upon a Time in America doesn't make you feel sympathy for its characters, these characters are actually quite nasty people but the way they are written and acted makes them compelling too. The two rape scenes are very shocking and perhaps brutal, but again that's no flaw in any way, because this slant on crime and the like is quite realistic if you put it in perspective.The acting is another strong asset. Robert DeNiro and James Woods, both are great actors, and both give brilliant performances. So overall, extraordinary, not only of its genre but of film full-stop. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
dimosthenis-21413,"May 21, 2019",9/10,"An incredible film, very emotional coming with an astonishing acting especially from De Niro. The pictures are full of meaning and make you want to be there. Sergio Leone achieved to depict the mysterious and dismal atmosphere of the story. Additionally I need to thing for long time so that to find the right word for the soundtrack, It's just an unrepeatable one. I can easily say that this film is a masterpiece from all aspects."
GenghisKelvin,"Jul 30, 2019",9/10,"A really good cops and robbers prohibition movie, De Niro and his fellow desperados are of course the baddies, James Woods plays the baddest of the baddies and Elizabeth McGovern plays the sexy female in an intriguing tale of children who run a gang who mature, sellout and fallout. This is a captivating and entertaining almost two hours of the best of Sergio Leone's direction with very convincing sets, cars and costumes which are great as a backdrop to the unfolding events, accompanied by evocative melodies by maestro Ennio Morricone."
goferba,"Jun 11, 2011",10/10,"For me this is the best film ever but i can understand people who didn't like it. 4 hours for a gangster film is hard to bear. But this film has a record of unforgettable scenes, an epic narrative, an extraordinary score, so many layers inside, an unique use of time, classic themes like loyalty, friendship, love treated using mythology and legendary close ups like the enigmatic smile at the end. I want to remember only the scene that explains perfectly the characters when the young Deborah, played by a spectacular teen Jennifer Connelly, read in a personnel way the Song of Songs to Noodles. Speechless. If justice can come late this film could be re-release nowadays with the more than 4 hours director's cut and participate to the Oscars and win whichever the competition is"
lee_eisenberg,"Feb 26, 2006",10/10,"After so many years of westerns, Sergio Leone made ""Once Upon a Time in America"", about several friends forced to abandon their loyalty as they age. This is one of those movies that's too hard to simply describe; you really have to see it to understand it. And you may be disappointed if you expect something exactly like ""The Godfather""; they are gangsters, but they're Jewish, so that changes things a little.If absolutely nothing else, this disproves the notion that we have nowadays that historical epics are always pieces of drudgery (blame ""Alexander"" for that stereotype). ""OUATIA"" is the sort of movie that could only star people like Robert DeNiro. It also stars James Woods, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Treat Williams, and Jennifer Connelly (in her debut), and they all do a great job. This movie is a masterpiece in every way. But don't take my word for it; see for yourself."
guenterfmang,"Dec 26, 2018",6/10,Up to this point it is a really good and enjoyable movie but then it gets mediocre and dull. The last hour I was just eagerly awaiting the end.
patherto,"Mar 22, 2004",6/10,"Like the curate's egg, OUTIA is good in parts. The sets are evocative, the camerawork masterful, the actors excellent. But there's got to be a plot here somewhere, boys and girls, and it's just not in evidence. Things happen, of course, and there are flashbacks to titillate the critics, and as I said the thing looks and acts beautifully. But there is no point to the whole, no compelling storyline to cling to through four hours of mishmash. My expectations were high, admittedly--OUTIA carries a lot of critical weight--but even if I had come into this movie cold, I would still have found it wanting. And I never, ever want to see it again."
rmtrott,"Apr 30, 2023",3/10,"As a Sergio Leone fan, this 4 hour american crime saga with the eminent crime cast should have created an all time classic, taking its place in the new world, 20th century Hollywood cannon.Sadly - what should have been a dead cert, meanders its way into a confused, unrealistic tale of unsympathetic characters with next to no thematic development. A hard edged upbringing interspersed with bizarre episodes involving any and all female roles looks like Direction by Committee, and one bent on adolescent self-gratification and misogynist quota/ box ticking.Leone should have cut the script, tightly edited, cut the artificially inserted, gratuitous episodes, mapped character arcs, and found something (such as dramatic tension of gang members avoiding their personal demise) to drive the film on. Scorsese, De Palma or Coppola all understood this - sad to see such a missed opportunity from Leone."
darth_sidious,"Jan 3, 2001",N/A,"My title sums up the film, albeit cliche, the film is a masterpiece. The story of a gang's rise from the prohibition years to the 60s. The film's main 2 character's are the focus of the picture. Without trying to spoil it, the film addresses 3 distinct eras in their lives.The film explores the heart, Noodles soul. A man struggling with himself, someone who plays evil acts, a man who sees the pure in his childhood sweetheart. A man never at peace.The film is directed by Leone, a master of his art. I'm a huge fan of his work. Each of his films got better and better, and Once Upon A time In America was a picture which had all the experience which he achieved in the 60s. It's almost a gift to himself.The film's locations are stunning, authentic and dirty.The screenplay is excellent, but the direction makes the film. Maybe one or two characters were underwritten, but it seems that the director wanted us to talk about the picture, discuss the possible loose ends, make up our own minds. Leone's methodical pacing is stunning.The acting is tremendous, can't praise James Woods and Robert De Niro enough, awesome!The photography is beautiful, it lacks colour giving it a gritty look, perfection!Morricone delivers another masterpiece, his score adds further depth and backups the director's story.See it wide-screen, this film is a stunning piece of cinema. Leone, you were the master!"
Catfish-3,"Jun 1, 2006",10/10,"This film is masterfully made. View only the directors cut. All other versions fail. There will be a time when Leone's family releases an even longer version, restoring over 45 minutes more of this film.Through paced story-telling, Leone reveals the tender and tough underpinnings of America's Mob-Labor-Politico history. This is the story of how the immigrants arrived, and succeeded in the tough streets of New York. All are heroes, all are bad guys, all are trying to make a living.The teaming of DeNiro, Woods, Pesci and Weld is perfect. Vulnerability show through all of these tragic figures. This is one of DeNiros finest roles. James Woods shines as the brains of the gang. Treat Williams has never been better.The soundtrack is incredible. That it was never submitted for an Oscar is one of the largest oversights in films history. Perfectly scored.I cannot wait until I see the rest of the story. Truly one of the best films ever made.10* out of 10*"
BA_Harrison,"Dec 6, 2015",9/10,"Director Sergio Leone is best known for his classic spaghetti westerns, but for my money, his final movie, gangster epic Once Upon A Time In America, is his most accomplished work. With a running time of 229 minutes (more if you're watching the Extended Director's Cut), it's longer than either Once Upon A Time in the West or The Good The Bad and The Ugly, and it's pacing is just as measured (some might say 'slow'), but the time passes far less painfully, so engaging are the characters and the drama that unfolds.Spanning decades, the story is truly monumental: it opens in the late 1960s with ageing gangster Noodles (Robert De Niro) returning to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty-five years in hiding, and then proceeds to cut back and forth between the present and the past to show his life as a young boy in an impoverished Jewish ghetto, as a tough gangster during the Prohibition period, and as an old man reacquainting himself with old friends. This skillful technique helps to keep the viewer engrossed long after their bum has gone numb, but fine performances from a stellar cast (which includes James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello, and a young Jennifer Connelly), excellent cinematography, and some brilliantly executed scenes of brutal violence, all accompanied by a wonderfully haunting pan flute score by the brilliant Ennio Morricone, help to ensure that nodding off is unlikely."
iqlpd,"Feb 11, 2007",10/10,"One of my favourite films of all time! This is one of those films that changes the way you view movies. The characters are profound, both in youth and in adulthood, and so well developed, the storyline so complex, and yet simple; this is the kind of film you can come back to, time and time again -- and you really will see something different, something new, each time you view it. (The fact that there is more than one version of this incredible film, adds to its complexity. There are different scenes in the short version, that are not in the long version, so it is beneficial to see both.)IMDb lists two running times, but I believe I've seen at least three versions: one a 5 hour version in French in the middle of the night! After viewing the long version, presumably the Director's Cut, I was particularly confused. I re-viewed another version, a shorter one, some time later, and finally understood the ending. While I love Mr. Leone's version (with his work I tend to feel the longer, the better) I found I didn't 'get' the ending until I saw the 'chopped version'. Needless to say, I've seen the movie many times through the 80s and 90s, first in the theatre, thank goodness, and later on television.I don't want to imply that the understanding of this film is a cumbersome task. I cherish films that make me think of them long after the final credits have rolled. The director weaves a tapestry, where we see some of his intentions easily. Others times, we move in closer, or view the piece from a different perspective. His talent allows us to believe we're seeing something 'new'. That's partly because we ourselves change over the years, and see things differently as we grow in our own experiences, but credit is also due the film-maker, who pulls us out of our reality and totally immerses us in his story.I have only to hear the score of this film, and my mind carries me back to New York at the turn of the LAST century ... I see the texture of the bricks, I recall the stunning beauty of both actresses who played the character Deborah Gelly, I see again the cream cake that was even better than the hope of sex, for one of the adolescent boys ... a scene that tells us there is still a child, a hungry child, in this young thug apprenticing to be a man and a gangster.I don't want to imply that it's a difficult movie to understand; just that there are so many levels, so many interpretations, each compelling and intriguing. Most movies of this length would deter many from seeing it, I'm sure. But never once did I feel that this film was 'too long'; I was never even aware of time passing. I would happily sit through four-hour films if they were as well made as Mr. Leone's. (Sadly, there are few of his calibre.)Beyond the script, the directing, the acting, ""ONCE"" is a visually stunning work of art. The music mesmerizes. The colours, textures and light in harmony with the score, are stamped in my memory, as clearly as my own recollections. This is great cinematography! The acting offered some of the best performances of many of the actors' careers. The timing is often impeccable (you'll know what I'm referring to when you view it), and a risk few directors would have dared to take. The writing is nothing less than brilliant, because of course, without a exceptional script, there is no film.Once Upon a Time in America belongs in the 'greats' list of film-making. The most shocking detail, in this film's history, is that it never received the recognition it deserved (in awards), and that it is less known that many inferior films. I feel privileged to have seen it on 'the big screen' a few times, back in the 80s. Some films translate well to DVD, but films of great cinematographic stature are always best appreciated on the silver screen.You can't consider yourself a film-fan, a movie-buff, if you haven't seen this one (or two or three) in each of its versions, several times. I defy you not to love it (them?), too!(Canadian spelling in this review)"
preston-6,"Sep 29, 1998",10/10,"Best creative structure to a film. One of the best film reflections on the American Dream and the nature of memory and regret.  The opium scene ending, in combination with the hypnotic soundtrack, provides more lasting emotional impact and psychological reflection than any other ending in film save Godfather II, which the film resembles.Plus James Woods is an acting deity in it.  Now if only Elizabeth McGovern knew how to act.Watch only the director's cut."

In Europe we had a chance to see that director's cut. As it was said in documentary movie about Sergio Leone, he collapsed after movie of his life was cut like it was done in USA in 1984. I can't even imagine what scenes were cut out. But the worst thing THEY changed the order of appearance of all shots going from the youth scenes to Noodles coming back from Buffalo in 1968. I saw that movie so many times, now I have DVD's, both European and American releases, that are now fortunately the same. Best CV I've ever heard? ""Fat Moe: What have you been doing all these years? Noodles: I've been going to bed early."""
andrei1981-1,"Nov 24, 2006",10/10,"I have read several comments on this film across the internet ""Best movie on prohibition"" ""Comparable only to Godfather"". I believe the movie is really about friendship and sacrifice. What is remarkable about this film is not only the screenplay but the remarkable ability of director Sergio Leone to create three movies in one with disregard to any chronological sequence of events. I have seen the movie two times in one week and I still have to watch it over a couple of times to fully understand the message.The most dramatic part of the movie is towards the end, when Noodles decides to call the police hoping that Max would be arrested and therefore give up his plan to rob the Federal Reserve Bank, a complete suicidal act. Upon his call the police comes and his friends are killed, than Eve, his girlfriend is murdered by the police.The movie begins in 1933 and ends with the same scene, with Noodles played by de Niro smoking opium on the bed at the Chinese place. This led a number of critics to the conclusion that actually Noodles is fantasizing about his future and I think this interpretation is correct. His devilish smile at the end of the movie is probably one of the most enigmatic pieces in filmography. Why is he smiling about? He just called the police and gave-in his friends who died in a shootout. is he smiling because everything is over, like some critics argue? I don't think so. He didn't seem unhappy up to this point, or at least not that desperate to explain such an emotion. Is it because he failed? I think this could be a possible answer. He was telling Fat Moe"" You can always tell winners and losers"" and he thought himself a loser. So the hysterical smile can be connected to a resignation in face of his fate. Logically, the movie should end in 1968. In a way or another. But it ends, strangely in 1933 with Noodles on a dose of opium and with a mysterious smile on his face. I think he dies that night along with his friends, the rest being just a premonition of what would happen if he stayed alive. The fact that Max survives in his fantasy is only one more reason to see it as a fantasy. Max was more than a friend, they seemed connected in life and death and the fact that Noodles was seeing him again in 1968 is just a projection of this close relationship, his brain refusing to accept that he practically murdered his best friend along with his other two childhood friends and his girlfriend Eve.The fact is even more dramatic and striking as you see the friendship of these boys starting in a harsh neighbourhood in the 20s and you see them sticking together ten years later. Noodles tries to save them but instead he kills them. His smile is only an ironical resignation of his failure. In his premonition, he meets Fat Moe once again in 1968 and at a point Moe says: ""I would have bet everything on you"" ""You would have lost"" comes the reply from Noodles. This is the essence of the movie...and it is a true masterpiece"
yavkaconsult,"Dec 17, 2023",3/10,"This film is not only super long and boring, but on top of that it contains one unrealistically annoying character - the character of Robert DeNiro, who by the way is also the protagonist of Once Upon a Time in America (1984).I don't want to deny Sergio Leone's directing skills, but at least with this project he failed in my opinion. It's not shot very memorable, and the story he set out to screen contains dull epitomes of drama, criminals and characters. There isn't anyone very memorable character, I'd even say most are an unpleasant sight.Kudos to Tuesday Weld and James Woods for the superb and perfect acting they represent, but it's a shame they stand out so much in this film and not so much in others.Final score: 3/10."
bbeach3,"May 31, 2001",10/10,"Where to begin? This hasn't always been on my list of favorite movies. I first encountered it when I was 9 or 10 and my parents let me watch the first videotape (first half) before deciding it wasn't appropriate for me. I didn't see it complete until five years later. Since then, I have seen it about half a dozen more times including once in a theater (crappy print, but still). I wrote an essay about it for my entrance paper to get into the graduate program at NYU and since I got in, OUATIA will always have a particularly special place in my heart. I now throw it out as my favorite film when people ask and the reasons that I love it are perhaps best encapsulated by Leone himself in the biography Something to Do with Death that came out last year:""I make fairy tales for grown-ups. I pay scrupulous attention to detail and making the setting realistic so I can focus on making the story mythic.""In a nutshell, that's all his films, but in particular the one that took fifteen years to get off the ground and ate up three full years of his life. OUATIA is above all else, for film lovers, with its spiderweb plot drifting through the decades and back and its deliberate, dreamy pace. It is also the finest gangster film ever, precisely because it focuses on the lowest rung of criminals and succeeds in never making the gangster life look glamorous. The friendship between Noodles and Max surprises with its refusal to paint one as the ""grounded"" half and the other as the ""loose cannon."" They're both given to violent outbursts and both capable of (increasingly diminishing) moments of tenderness and compassion. This makes Noodles'(DeNiro) betrayal of Max (Woods) all the more haunting, and since Noodles's guilt is what drives the entire film, it's crucial for that to come across.Much has been said about whether the film is a simple story, told out of sequence, a flashback, a flashforward, or an opium dream/ nightmare. I opt for the latter interpretation and without spoiling any of the film's surprises, consider this: Move the last shot of the film to the very beginning and everything else falls into place. The beauty of the closing shot (and it is one of the greatest closing shots in cinema) is the way it reveals nothing and everything.There isn't even time to go into everything else that moves the spirit (Morricone's mythic score, Tonino Delli Colli's cinematography that finds the right tone for each of the three decades portrayed, the art design, particularly in the 1923 sequence with the children). I am not automatically a fan of long films but Leone creates a world that is worth falling into for 227 minutes)A note about the running time: the bio reveals that the film runs 229 minutes outside the US, the extra two minutes being from the rape of Deborah. No longer version exists. Leone had wanted the film to run for 250 to 265 minutes but the footage that exists to make it longer was never dubbed to do so."
arsaellb,"Jul 14, 2019",10/10,"I dont write reviews often, but this time I felt I had to.The reason being that many of the earlier reviews of this film meant that this movie is too long and not worth seeing. I totally disagree. The film is long, I give you that, but the slowness gives you the right mood and it tells a very intriguing story and I really loved it. Cinema magic!"
Yakhalz,"Oct 29, 2004",9/10,"Of course it's very hard to make up the minds of someone else. That's why there are always some rough discussions being held about the rating of a movie. Everyone has a personal opinion, and you have to respect that. Besides that it IS possible to rate a movie on technical aspects. You may not like a film, but in a good movie there are always things you do like.Once upon a time in America is a fantastic movie. At least that's my opinion. The story is fantastic, because you're following three different threads, which in a way has much to do with each other. The Godfather Part II, another favorite of mine, tried to amuse the audience with two threads, and it succeeded very well. The huge difference of the Godfather II is it's speed, it's rhythm. I know a couple of people that don't like it, and that's because it's too slow. But not by far as slow as Once upon a time in America. That's probably one of the main reasons it's not being loved as much as other great films.You have to like Leone's style, but his Westerns are admired, although they're very slow too. But in a way I think people didn't expect it in a Mafia film, and did in a Western. Leone plays with switching to another storyline in this movie, and he does a fantastic job. The way some remarkable objects (the missing brick, the wall at the station) are used to remark a flashback is extraordinary.Another good aspect of Leone is that his scores are composed by Ennio Morricone since A Fistful of Dollars. Good music is the thing that gives a movie more weight, and makes you remember it. And again in Once upon a time in America Morricone succeeded compose one of the best scores ever made for a movie.Unfortunately this movie was way too long for theaters, so they made the biggest mistake possible. Instead of dividing it in two pieces, they deleted an amazing amount of scenes, what raped this movie. The latest DVD release will hopefully give some of it's beauty back, because this movie is a masterpiece. The only movie I've seen that could compare with this is The Godfather Part II, in style and supremacy. If you don't like slow movies, it's a pity, because a movie like this will not be made anymore. And perhaps that's good, as almost every succeeded movie has an equivalent or remake. Once upon a time in America still is a unique performance."
chron,"Nov 19, 2000",10/10,"This is an exceptional movie.  The progression throughout the lives of these people makes for a compelling, well-written movie.  The acting and direction are fantastic.Most people consider ""The Godfather"" to be a definitive gangster movie, but I liked this more.  It was a more interesting story and considerably more violent.If you look for this movie, ensure that you get the long version.  The American version cut out several minutes and ordered the story in chronological order.  The long version requires more from the audience to track what is going on, but makes for a more interesting movie.Why isn't this out on DVD!?!"
pdmarsay,"Jan 3, 2006",10/10,"This film is an amazing cinematic experience. Sergio Leones final film is in my opinion, also his best. The story is so deep, and so rich. The themes, love, friendship, betrayal, morality, memory, life, etc... are so poignant and universal that it is hard not to relate to the characters and situations in this film at least in some way. All the performances are exceptional, James Woods being the highlight in my opinion. I have watched this film three times now, and I plan on re-visiting it even more in the future, as I now own the DVD. To describe this film it is hard to know where to start, as the story is told almost completely out of chronological order; it is a film which literally requires you to watch it more than once. Basically, it is a film about the life of a man, played by Robert De Niro, from his boyhood, right through to his old age, and about the friends and enemies he makes, and all the major issues he encounters. But more specifically, it is about his relationship with one main friend, the adult part of whom is played by James Woods. I can't think what else to say but to recommend this powerful tale to you as strongly as possible, and to wish you several equally enthralling viewings of it!"
ssolkoff,"Oct 3, 2021",6/10,"Here's the deal. You have great actors and actresses. They give moving performances with a weak script. Nothing makes up for the messy, unfinished plot line. The producers and director were caught up in the film noir predilection for hiding the ball from the viewer. With a weak story, the idea is to simply ""leave it to the viewer to decide,"" a device that can work very well with a string story but is contrived and bothersome here. Add to the weak story some endlessly annoying direction which has the camera, for example, on the back of a briefcase for forty-five seconds because it seemed so avante grade when, in reality, it is just stupid. The first American release is a disaster because not even the strong acting can make up for that level of incompetence. The European release and the common streaming version are just better enough to allow the great performances to come through. This movie should be watched, appreciated for the great acting (and soundtrack) and appropriately dissed for not tying everything together. Yes, sometimes it's great to leave pieces for the viewer to knit together but not when there is no basis of possibility. I'm not going to the list the impossibilities but start with the fact that DeNiro doesn't even know who this national political figure is, even though he has been in the papers, radio and TV for at least the last five years prior to the denouement. Huh?"
j.dawson,"Oct 5, 2006",10/10,"One of the very best films ever made. Period. If you haven't seen it - see the full-length 4 hour version. All other versions are trashed travesties. If you're reading this, it's because you're interested in films. If you haven't seen it, you owe it to yourself to see one of the few grown-up masterpieces of American cinema. There's no point in trying to describe the story or even the themes. Suffice it to say that this is on a bigger scale than you even realise watching the film the first time. It's about the formative years of the American Empire, and has much to teach us that is relevant still. It's very much a European film - the equivalent is probably Bertolucci's 1900 - but it deals with a uniquely American history. Violence, rape, union-breaking and assassination: it's the perfect American History X."
Cinema-canabico,"May 4, 2025",2/10,"Once Upon a Time in America is a grand epic from the incomparable Sergio Leone, where his meticulous direction builds a nostalgic and melancholic portrait of gangster life over decades. The cinematography is impeccable, utilizing light and shadow to create an atmosphere that oscillates between dream and reality. Ennio Morricone's soundtrack adds a deep emotional layer to the film, with compositions that reinforce the feeling of lost time and fragmented memories. The performances are memorable, with Robert De Niro and James Woods bringing depth and complexity to their characters, and Elizabeth McGovern offering a striking presence. The way Leone structures time, blending past and present, makes the experience even more immersive and hypnotic.However, I was deeply disturbed by the way rape is portrayed in the film. Two long and uncomfortable scenes of sexual violence, the first being used as a joke and the second as a narrative element that, instead of explicitly condemning the act, ends up somewhat romanticizing the victim's suffering in a distressing and surreal reunion with the rapist. Although Leone is a masterful storyteller, this aspect of the film, for me, can be seen as a moral failing that ruined the experience and the empathy toward the characters."
jean_the_critic765,"Nov 17, 2024",N/A,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (C'era una volta l'america) is often hailed as a masterpiece of epic storytelling, but beneath its sprawling runtime and lavish production design lies a film that struggles to justify its ambition. While undeniably ambitious, the movie's flaws in pacing, characterization, and thematic coherence overshadow its artistic merits, leaving it more of a slog than the gripping crime epic it aims to be.At nearly four hours, the film's runtime is an endurance test. Leone's decision to tell the story non-linearly, jumping across decades, feels more confusing than compelling. While nonlinear storytelling can add intrigue, here it dilutes the narrative momentum, making the film feel unnecessarily disjointed and cumbersome. Many scenes drag on for far too long, testing the audience's patience and diluting the emotional impact.One of the film's most glaring issues is its depiction of women. Female characters are either relegated to stereotypes-mothers, temptresses, or victims-or exist solely to serve the male characters' arcs. The portrayal of violence against women, particularly the graphic and exploitative scenes of sexual assault, feels gratuitous and undermines the film's supposed depth. These moments aren't explored with the gravity they deserve, leaving a sour taste that detracts from the story.While Robert De Niro delivers a solid performance as Noodles, his character-and the relationships he forms-lacks emotional complexity. The supposed friendship and betrayals between Noodles and his gang never feel fully fleshed out, leaving their interactions cold and unconvincing. Moments that are meant to be poignant, like the tragic ending, fall flat because the film fails to create a meaningful connection with its characters.The film attempts to tackle a multitude of themes-loyalty, regret, the passage of time, and the dark side of the American Dream-but it spreads itself too thin. Leone touches on these ideas without delving deeply enough into any of them, leaving the film feeling thematically unfocused. Instead of a profound exploration of morality or memory, we're left with a collection of loosely connected ideas that never fully coalesce.While the cinematography and production design are undeniably stunning, the film often feels like it prioritizes visuals over storytelling. Beautifully framed shots and Ennio Morricone's haunting score can't compensate for the lack of emotional resonance and narrative drive. The result is a movie that feels hollow, more concerned with its aesthetic than its substance.Once Upon a Time in America is a technically impressive but deeply flawed film. Its sprawling ambition and visual grandeur are undone by self-indulgent pacing, shallow character development, and problematic thematic elements. While it remains a landmark in Leone's career, it's far from the masterpiece it's often made out to be. For all its cinematic flair, the film fails to deliver a compelling or cohesive story, leaving audiences exhausted rather than inspired."
Scoopy,"Nov 19, 1998",10/10,"I first saw the two-hour theater release, and felt this was a lame movie, a waste of great talents.That's because that version should never have been shown. It was some kind of marketing-oriented concept that the movie needed to be short and have a chronological narrative. Well, that concept not only failed to market the film successfully, but it butchered a great, great filmI don't like to throw around the word ""masterpiece"", but that term is valid for the 227 minute version of the film with the complex interweaving of time periods. However many stars there are in your rating system, this gets them all. Could easily rank among the 100 best films ever made, and may be the single most underrated movie."
davidmister,"Jul 23, 2005",10/10,"i first saw this film when it was on 1 of the movie channels,showing the first half of the flick on the 1 night,followed by the second period on the next.to that point i'd never seen a DeNiro film and as i had nothing better to do i thought i'd give it a bash.I'm usually 1 to commit myself to a film once i'm comfortably seated and after about 40 minutes i found i was totally drawn in to what i was watching and by the end of the first half had no intention of missing the concluding 2 or so hours the following night.My whole opinion to film has changed since seeing this movie.Once Upon A Time In America has a certain aura about it that no other film has ever had upon me.There was nothing i could fault about it.From the story,to the music,to the exquisite acting this film will go down as the greatest film i've ever seen and nothing else has come close 2 comparison since.Its ranking of 120th in the top 250 list to me is a surprise to say the least.DeNiro and Woods performance as the mysterious Noodles and the fiery Max respectively is second to none.The child actors who play the leading characters in the 1920's also do a superb job.Ennio Morricones haunting score was fabulous and its a crying shame that the soundtrack was never given the real accolades it truly deserved.Once Upon A Time In America is a film that sticks with you long after the end credits come rolling,which very few films manage to achieve.I wasn't too sure the next day whether i'd just seen a masterpiece or whether it was simply a film i wouldn't forget about in a hurry.There are many memorable scenes that truly moved me.Such as the young Patsy eating the cake,Noodles meeting with Max after his 35 year exile and the dramatic scene in the 1920's when the gang lose,as the epitaph puts it 'their youngest and strongest'.OUATIA isn't a film i'd recommend anybody to see.It is portrayed as a gangster film but once viewed it is actually also seen as a story of love,hate and betrayal.You'd need to give the film your full attention as the complex storyline and the constant flashbacks can easily cause confusion.Those who prefer more action packed gangster films would probably lean towards Goodfellas but those who appreciate the lesser known fine films should not live without seeing this masterpiece."
paulcannon,"May 16, 2005",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America is my favorite film. It plays like a live-action novel, and at 229 minutes, it would probably be faster to read the book (it's loosely based on ""The Hoods"" by Harry Gray).Sergio Leone uses his classic filming style in which broad landscapes and wide angle scenery shots are juxtaposed against close up shots of character's faces. Everything is meticulously edited and every shot has something important to say.The strong point of the film is its meaning, which is generally overlooked by most critics, who are typically more interested in plot. The plot is convoluted and at times uninteresting, but the message that the film sends is far more important. This movie is ultimately about the individual versus the collective. Using the idea of the ""American Dream"" as a catalyst, Leone employs themes of friendship, love, crime, and nostalgia to illustrate why individualism is overrated.Max (James Woods) gradually takes over Noodles' (Robert de Niro) childhood gang. As they grow older, Max acquires more and more of what Noodles once had: his lover, his money, his friends, and, ultimately, his life. Max discovered that he could use his close-knit friends to catapult himself into a better life, while destroying Noodles' life and getting his other friends killed.Leone assumes that the American Dream has to do with our focus on the individual. He shows the flaw in our belief that individual happiness doesn't require collective contentment by showing it in an individual case. What's interesting about this film is that it takes the perspective of the man who lost everything, unlike most American stories, which tend to illustrate a struggle to success. Noodles is left without money and exiled from his home for 35 years. Max climbs to the heights of power, but is left regretful and unhappy.In the final scene, Noodles is seen smoking opium and smiling in a drug-induced haze. Through the complex sequence of flashbacks, it's possible that everything in the movie after a certain point was nothing more than a dream of Noodles'. Leone is suggesting that the American Dream itself is nothing more than a dream."

I watched it with not so much excitement; expectation was mild. My head was blown off, not by huge special effects or big explosions, there's nothing of that in the movie, but from an amazing story, beautifully told, and lots of detail. You really need to turn off from the world to see this masterpiece. It has great acting, great plot, awesome music, long silent scenes where music is the only story teller. This is not your normal movie hit, it's a deep, slow movie. I won't even try to tell you what is it about, because you can't reduce it like that."
w-71474,"May 15, 2020",10/10,"Years later, the desperate noodles returned to New York. In the bar of an old friend, loyal and foolish, he slowly asked him: ""How have you lived in these 35 years?"" Quietly answered: ""I just go to bed every morning."" It's hard to say a word, full of vicissitudes. His temples were covered with white hair. He was no longer a gangster on the street, and he was no longer a gangster in the sky. He was just a calm, stumbling old man. He had nothing but memories ...His life was about several brothers who were born and died, and a beautiful girl; about friendship and dreams, about youth and love, and about loyalty and betrayal. In those years, when a person was silently displaced and traveled far away, what was he holding in his heart? Is it the betrayal of the ringing phone reminder after years? Is it a girl who is ignorant of the angelic dance peeping through the teenager's doorway?
Years later, he finally realized that he had been guilty for 35 years, which was originally pure loyalty and friendship; the brother he devoted to and maintained for life had deceived him for 35 years.There is nothing new under the sun, and the key to good movies lies in the way they tell stories. The yellowish color of the film seems to be covered with a layer of mist, so that each lens is like an old yellowed picture; the high and distant pan flute is awkward. The music and the plot blended together to complement each other, and several transitions were made to happen. In the four-hour movie, the plot is clear when you see the second pass. If you watch it a few times, you will find that almost every shot is instructive and indispensable. The people behind the camera used Noodles to vent the concept: the void of the void, everything is the void."

liamfarren-09503,"Jan 8, 2020",6/10,Can't really say that this movie is bad but I wouldn't call it a masterpiece either. It is worth a watch but you won't go back a second time. All in all I find this director over rated and rather dull for this day and age. In a time gone by these may have been good movies but I think that was due to the lack of actual decent movies made. I'll probably get slated for this but really the Godfather was probably one of the most over rated movies I have ever watched and I'd put this in the same league.
suzys-82488,"Jul 13, 2022",3/10,"I don't know what the director was thinking when he directed this movie.As others have mentioned, there are many unnecessarily long scenes that should have been cut down. I get that the early 1900s was a different time but some scenes with kids and women were disturbing, particularly the rape scenes. What kind of a driver continues to drive when a woman is obviously getting sexually abused in the backseat? Why did the writers/director choose to do this? And the overall treatment of women were terrible, as they were treated like sex objects and not human beings. This kind of made me wonder how the director himself viewed women??Overall, I do not recommend this movie, I only stuck around to see the ending but I was ready to quit after the glorified rape scene and it made me see Robert De Niro in a different light.I only gave the movie 3 stars because of the 1900s aesthetic."

MaikiIMDb,"Dec 28, 2019",10/10,"This is NOT a gangster movie. This movie is about love, friendship, childhood, nostalgia, loyalty and betrayal, and about how good or bad decisions determine our success or failure in love/life. And YES, all this in the context of a group of friends and Gangsters of the 20/30's.Hence, it can't be compared with classic gangster films such as the Godfather or Goodfellas. It won't have the same amount of action of such movies, because OUATIA is not about that. The Gangster mood is just an attrezzo used to explain a really sad story (the life of the protagonist), full of good memories and success, but with an unfortunate -and too early- ending.For those rating 1 and 2..., they were probably looking for a typical gangster movie, with plenty of shots, blood, gangs fighting, etc, etc, and they probably didn't realize that the movie is not about that. Otherwise they're just offended haters and depraved after seeing some female nudity.If only looking at the graphic aspects, the film is a masterpiece. Every each frame is meticulously and thoroughly thought. The deliberate extremely slow pace of the entire movie is needed to transmit all the passion and drama. For this reason, this movie requires to be watched with the same tranquil and relaxed mood, and with all five senses put on the movie, in order to catch every detail.Of course, get the director's cut. Because the commercial was an atrocity."

prrthead-791-753963,"Oct 15, 2021",10/10,"This film is truly spectacular! I always remembered it as being good but just rewatched it. The story is great! The acting is even better! Add in the scenery, the costumes, the music, etc. And it's a masterpiece! It definitely had some despicable moments against women that are very hard to watch but that shouldn't detract from an incredibly well done movie!"
moonspinner55,"Mar 18, 2017",6/10,"Stylish, perceptive and violent crime drama from director Sergio Leone, an epic-scaled adaptation of the book ""The Hoods"" by Herschel Goldberg (aka Harry Grey) about the lives of four gangsters in the years 1921, 1933 and 1968. Former street kids from the Jewish ghettos of Manhattan's lower East Side graduate from petty crimes and bootlegging to robbery and rape, to providing muscle for a union boss. Initially crippled by the film company's decision to hack the U.S. release print down to 2 hours and 15 minutes (the current extended director's cut runs 4 hours and 18 minutes), ""Once Upon a Time in America"" took many years to garner its now-sterling reputation among admirers of the gangster genre. Still, even in its mammoth original state, the wan subplots involving the ladies (Elizabeth McGovern as an actress and Tuesday Weld as a lascivious moll)--and a penchant for vulgarity and the exploitation of women in general--lessens the overall impact of the tale. The art direction, the score (from Ennio Morricone), the cinematography (by Tonino Delli Colli) and Leone's rhythm are each florid and outstanding in their individual respects, while the performances by Robert De Niro and James Woods (and, in a smaller dimension, Joe Pesci) are dynamic. **1/2 from ****"
DCFansAreDumb,"Sep 21, 2019",1/10,This is a garbage misogynist movie that plays rape scenes for laughs.
noodlescorleone37927,"Mar 5, 2021",10/10,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a total masterpiece and one of those films that is well-crafted in every possible department. The storyline is complex yet masterful, the screenplay is extremely well-done, the direction by Sergio Leone is top-notch, as well as the cinematography. What's more is that the music by the legendary Ennio Morricone is arguably the greatest in movie history, plus the editing is superb.For the superb editing, that is for the 229-minute European Director's Cut (which I own on both DVD and Blu-ray) and the 251-minute Restored Director's Cut (which I only own on Blu-ray), not the shortened, chronological-ordered American version that's 2½ hours long. The shortened American cut was a box office bust when it was first released in the U.S. in 1984, whereas the European Director's Cut was a big hit overseas in the same year, especially at the Cannes Film Festival. I've never seen the shortened American cut, but from what I've heard, it's a sham! Therefore, I don't think I'll ever watch that version, because it's impossible to find it these days. Despite the film's modern critical acclaim, the original shortened American release was panned by critics and audiences, plus it didn't receive any Academy Award nominations. If the shortened American cut hadn't existed at all, I suppose ""Once Upon a Time in America"" would've been nominated for some Oscars, including Best Picture, Best Director (Sergio Leone), and Best Original Score (Ennio Morricone).Martin Scorsese's ""Raging Bull"" is regarded as the best film of the 1980s, but I pick this film as the best of that decade, with ""Raging Bull"" ranking in second place. Set in the 1920s, 1930s, and 1960s in non-chronological order, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" has its themes of life, love, memories, opium dreams, regret, greed, friendship, betrayal, revenge, and the rise and fall of a group of four Jewish gangsters from the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York. Moreover, it has an excellent ensemble cast consisting of Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Treat Williams, Tuesday Weld, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Danny Aiello, and, of course, the very young Jennifer Connelly.I really love watching some gangster flicks, including ""The Godfather"", ""The Godfather: Part II"", ""Goodfellas"", ""Pulp Fiction"", and ""Scarface"" (Al Pacino version), plus Sergio Leone movies, including ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", but ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is the best and my favorite, plus it never gets old. It's one of those films that is hard work and not for children to watch, because of the R-rating, but ultimately a very rewarding experience and an epic gangster tour de force.Regardless if I like the European Director's Cut or the Restored Director's Cut better, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" holds a special place in my heart and makes a strong case for the best and my favorite movie of all time."
douglascharles-72527,"Oct 4, 2021",10/10,"This is quite simply one of the best movies I've ever seen. As far as mob style movies I'd put this in the top 3 of all time. For the first 15 minutes I actually got close to switching it off, and I'm glad I didn't, because over the next 3.75 hours I kept saying out loud ""what a movie this is"" as it kept getting better and better. The impact of the movie kept me up all night and I was in somewhat of a shock for several days. You'll need to watch it in 1-2 sittings and without distraction as this is movie gold! No one has the screen presence of De Niro in a movie like this. Sergio Leone flexes his muscles in this one and sucks you into the emotion and drama."
cubinator,"Jun 6, 2002",10/10,"I just saw this movie and I always wanted to see it.  It was on AMC so I deicded to watch it.  I thought that it would be your ordinary Godfather like mafia movie, but it was way better.  This movie might not have the best editing, but it has a great story and Acting.  De Niro is good as always, But James Woods is the one that stands out in probably the best performance of his career.  Like most Mafia movies it deals with the American Dream, but while Adding to the American Dream story there is also a theme of loyalty, friendship, and love.  The love story between Noodles and Debroah is probably one of the best love stories ever on film.  The scene where the youngest member of the gang dies and Noodles' retaliation is beautiful.  I have seen alot of Gang/Mafia movies and probably this is my 2nd favorite (Behind the Godfather.)  I thought the film would move slow but it moved fast un-like Godfather part II in which there was all this extra dialoge that the film didn't need.  There is great direction from Sergio Leone, and a great Musical score by Ennio Morricone.  I recommend all people to see this movie, it is a wonderful story.  I would also like to buy this on DVD and see the original 6 hour film.  I saw the 4 hour.  10/10"
EHEHL,"Apr 22, 2003",10/10,"A perfect film that never loses it's touch. Beautifully shot (you will never forget the lighting), incredibly acted. Great sets, great production design.  Director is a true master with the genre.  If you haven't seen this film and you're looking for a classic, this is one to see.  Highly scored, but still way underrated.  A master in the glorious winter of his life."
SeriousJest,"Feb 6, 2012",6/10,"This is a high-quality gangster flick, with a good story, interesting characters, and an outstanding cast. It was cool to see Jennifer Connelly shine so brightly, even at a young age, and in her first feature film role. The makeup artists were also impressive. In aging De Niro 30 years, they made him look pretty similar to his appearance now, almost 30 years later! The movie was extremely long, but there weren't many boring moments. While I initially thought that more of the film should have been cut, I later learned from its IMDb trivia page that:(1) Leone was contracted to deliver a 2-hours-and-45-minutes-long movie.(2) Upon completion of filming, the movie ran 8-10 hours.(3) Leone and editor Nino Baragli originally cut it down to 6 hours, and planned to release two 3-hour films.(4) The producers forced Leone to cut it down to 3 hours and 49 minutes, leaving 45 minutes that he considered essential on the cutting room floor, including: further explanation of the mob/labor relationship, Noodles (De Niro) meeting Carol (Weld) in 1968, and a good deal of footage featuring Noodles's relationship with Eve (Fluegel).(5) The film premiered at the 1984 Cannes Film Festival in its original running time of 3 hours and 49 minutes.(6) The Ladd Company heavily edited the American release, against Leone's wishes, down to 2 hours and 24 minutes. This version scrapped the flashback structure Leone used, and instead arranged all the scenes in chronological order. Most of the major cuts were in the childhood scenes, making the 1933 scenes the most prominent part of the movie. The conclusion was also altered.(7) A few days before the film's premier in 1984, Williams found out the 2-hour version would be shown in theaters. He was heard to have said that no one would understand the movie in the shortened version.(8) The 2-hour version flopped in the U.S., and many American critics, who knew of Leone's original cut, attacked the short version viciously; some critics compared shortening the film to shortening Richard Wagner's operas (some of which run over 5 hours), saying that works of art that are meant to be long should be given the respect they deserve. The movie was shut out of the Oscars, with no nominations.(9) When the 3-hour-and-49-minute version was released on video and DVD, the film ultimately found commercial and critical success.(10) According to Woods, a critic dubbed the movie's 2-hour theatrical version the worst of 1984; years later that same critic watched the 3- hour-and-49-minute version and called it the best of the 1980s.Based on the foregoing, I believe the studio should have let Leone put out two 3-hour films, or at least it should have added the additional 45 minutes that Leone wanted (and then split the movie into two). The script contains many complex relationships and sub-plots, which developed over the course of half of a century, naturally begging an unreasonably long run timeeven after 4 hours, some significant relationships, characters, and sub-plots still needed more development. At first, I thought that maybe the answer would have been to eliminate those complexities altogether, instead of partly depicting them, but the widespread disdain of the 2-hour version suggests that the movie is much worse without them. Therefore, I think that the best answer would have been to embrace the complexity and give Leone the time that he needed to best develop this film.I also would have liked to see the film explore more of the differences between Jewish and Italian mobsters. Other than a few camera shots of Jewish food, Yiddish expressions, the Star of David, and Hasidic Jews walking around New York, these characters could have been written as Italian, with no difference.This movie is an 8 in pure quality, and I respect its ""it is what it is"" depiction of its protagonists, but I found De Niro's character so morally despicable that I had some trouble staying engaged. I was also a bit disappointed to learn of several historical inaccuracies in this film, according to its goofs page on IMDb."

shanakeemedia,"Jan 12, 2007",10/10,"The Greatest Movie ever made.I have studied this movie time and time again and never tire of either watching or listening to Ennio Morricone's fantastic score.I also admired the way Sergio Leone moved from timescale to timescale by using music. Once you heard a certain piece of music you knew what period it was set in and the characters involved.The one week point was the ending. I know it is left to our imagination as the garbage truck passes but I would have liked to have seen a little more closure, other than that I can only give it the praise it deserves.Pity Sergio Leone never lived long enough to see his masterpiece become the cult movie it now is."
yihong.yao,"May 30, 2000",10/10,"Godfather is probably more entertaining. However, this movie makes you want to cry and think hard about life.  I have watched this movie about 10 times. Everytime after I watched it, I felt exhausted and extremely sad.  There is just so much stuff in this movie and it's basically impossible for me to compare this movie to any other single movie, maybe a string of Fellini's or Bergman's movies. Remember I am using the word string. A lot of people just do not like this movie. People I think (or used to think) had good taste think the movie is too long, too dry, and basically just a big waste of time. But some people who have seen it agree with my view that it is an enormously rich and rewarding film. The problem is that the film is almost four hours long, and can be somewhat confusing with its layers of flashbacks. However, the full story of the film is a large one, and Leone's style is so operatic at this point that it takes much longer than the plot demands. There are many slow crane shots of various streets in New York's lower east side, and many awkward silences and pauses where nothing is physically happening. The action, however, does not seem slow to me. None of Leone's movies seem slow. Leone keeps everything moving quite nicely, yet he pauses to establish the mood with, for example, a crane shot of the bustling New York street, or a scene where Noodles stirs his coffee for a couple minutes, letting the mood become extremely uncomfortable. None of Sergio Leone's Western characters seem to have much emotion in any of his movies. There is emotion, but it tends to be emotion that is extremely repressed, hidden beneath a calm, tough exterior. This film is different. Noodles (Robert de Niro) does not seem to have any emotions, extremely odd for the protagonist of a movie. When Noodles comes home and visits Fat Moe after 35 years away, his first words after seeing Moe are ""I brought you back the key to your clock"". There is a reason for Noodles loss of affect, as the psychologists call it. His emotion has been buried under the memory of having inadvertently killed his best friends, his soul has clearly died. After meeting Max (James Woods) as a kid, Noodles, Max, Patsy, and Cockeye form a gang. After spending mostof his childhood in jail for avenging the death of a friend, Noodles rejoins Max and the gang,to find Max starting an ambitious climb to the top of the organized crime ladder. Eventually,Max becomes too ambitious, and after prohibition is repealed, seeks to rob the Federal Reserve. To stop him from an obviously suicidal heist, Noodles turns Max in. However,Max and the rest of the gang get into a shoot-out with the police, and Noodles soon hears of the death of Max, Patsy and Cockeye. Noodles can't stop thinking about the call made that killed his best friends, and soon has to flee New York because the crime syndicate he worked for now is trying to kill him. Thirty-five years later, he is still haunted by the memories of his dead friends. He is mysteriously summoned to New York by an unknown person for unknown reasons, and soon discovers a trail of clues that will lead to a great revelation. At the end, there is the final smile by Noodles, doped up on opium, the only time in the movie that he looks completely happy and at peace. Even though this is an earlier Noodles, this is Leone's way of depicting Noodle's return to normality after 35 years of grief. It is the perfect conclusion to this movie. This is a story of a man at war with himself. Noodles is criminal, savage, ruthless, and is sexually animalistic (as demonstrated in the various raping scenes). Yet he is also tender, loving, down-to-earth, and honorable. The center of this conflict is Deborah, who loves Noodles, and tries to turn him away from his criminal side. Deborah is the one pure thing in his life, the one thing that he loves, and when she is about to leave for an acting career, Noodles rapes her. He rapes her because he is mad at her, he is confused, and realizes that this is probably the last time he will ever see her, so he must have sex with now or never. Besides, that is Noodle's instinct, and his sudden moves on Deborah would be quite acceptable with the kind of girl he normally sees. Perhaps he rapes her because he sees in her a purity that he can never have, tries to take it and in the process destroys it. When Noodles' realizes what he has done, he starts on a slow recovery process, gradually becoming less and less criminal, which forces the rift with Max, who is determined to build a huge organized crime empire. When Max and the others are dead, and Noodles flees New York, his bad side has vanished. And when he comes back, he is a changed man. The reason that I feel this is the best gangster movie is because none have the combination of style and substance that this films brings. It's not just about gangsters, its a look inside the soul of Noodles. Robert de Niro gives such a wonderful understated performance that the character of Noodles sticks with you. I can still remember Noodles just by a certain look in de Niro's eyes, a sort of calm depression, a look that has the weariness of the world in it. This is a movie where the mood of repressed sadness will linger long after the film has ended. Very few films are as powerful."
ctowyi,"Mar 24, 2016",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America is a 1984 Italian-American epic crime drama film co-written and directed by Italian filmmaker Sergio Leone and starring Robert De Niroand James Woods. Based on Harry Grey's novel The Hoods, it chronicles the lives of Jewish ghetto youths who rise to prominence in New York City's world of organized crime. The film explores themes of childhood friendships, love, lust, greed, betrayal, loss, broken relationships, and the rise of mobsters in American society. It was the final film of Leone's career and the first feature film he had directed in thirteen years.The runtime of the film is 3h 50min and I didn't even go to the toilet all through it. It may be too long for most people but I can tell you that my wifey and me weren't even bored in the slightest. This is Sergio Leone at the height of his game and his direction is masterclass. His sketches of the characters are brief but underscored with verve. Words cannot begin to describe what he has accomplished here. The opening sequences kept me spellbound - a scene of violence, a sickening death, leading to De Niro at an opium den. You know the dragnet is closing in on him, then the fricking ringing phone that never stops ringing. I kept looking for an elusive ringing phone but it never comes. We are treated to images like three dead bodies which makes no sense at all, but dammit I couldn't tear my eyes and ears away, and then we flash forward 35 years and we see the bloody phone. What audacity! What spunk! The opening had me on the palm of its hand. I was minced meat, ready to be pounded, tenderised and moulded to become a viewer Sergio Leone wants. Such opacity in the images but you will instantly know you are in the hands of a master and have complete trust in him. Every scene is handcrafted to perfection with such a high level of meticulosity.Don't get me talking about the ending. This is an ending that is impossible to shut up about. You will want to discuss with someone with at least some measure of acuity WTF was that about. For me there are two ways to look at the ending and what it means for the preceding over 3 hours you have just seen. This is as good as a mindfcuk but with such brilliance. I can say this is not a film for all tastes but it is definitely for cineastes out there"
sauravjoshi85,"Apr 28, 2021",9/10,"Once upon a time in America is an epic crime drama movie directed by Late Sergio Leone and stars Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Tuesday Weld, James Hayden, William Forsythe and Treat Williams with Larry Rapp.This movie must be termed as another Gem by the great Leone and in this movie he depicts the from early to middle of 20th Century pure perfectly be it the vehicles, dressing style or buildings the changes has been depicted superbly.The movie showcases the life of two friends, their friendship, their rise, fall, betrayal and greed for power. The characters are introduced very nicely by the director and since the movie is 3.49 hours long the director has ample time to showcase all the details and trust me neither the movie nor the direction or the screenplay will disappoint you.Acting is superb and once again Robert De Niro steals the show in the character of Noodles, he is a talented actor and a seasoned director like Leone has just adored the talent. James Woods has also been quite effective, rest of the cast were equally impressive.Screenplay of the movie is slow but effective and will not loose the grip from the movie, most of the scenes are so beautifully shot that it looks realistic. Climax of the movie is strong. Another strong aspect of the Leone's movie is it's music and the music in this movie is quite amazing.This was the final movie directed by the great Sergio Leone and we can witness the greatness of his work till the last movie he directed. The great Leone is now not between us but he will always be immortal with his stupendous work. My tribute to him."
ktappe,"Jun 29, 2002",6/10,"As a fan of Leone's spaghetti western trilogy and of Robert DeNiro, I was very much looking forward to finally seeing this film. Quite a letdown. Despite good direction and acting, the story absolutely d-r-a-g-s. How anyone can comparethis to the Godfather trilogy is beyond me--that series has movement,development, continuity, and lives up to the emotions its characters express. This film has characters constantly being deeply introspective ... and that's about all it has. There are a few fun to watch moments such as when the boyscatch the crooked cop having sex and shake him down, but they're all too rare. This is a wistful film that might interest those who were there but like home movies, it won't interest anyone else. Two and a half hours of watching DeNiro long for the olden days in discontinuous flashbacks is two hours too much. If you want to see a good DeNiro flick set in NYC, see ""A Bronx Tale"" instead."
SoulPoet1818,"Jun 15, 2003",6/10,"I thought this movie would be amazing, but the scenes that added to the long length were not needed and did not propell the movie in any way. The directing was horrible. Coming from a directory straight out of the Dirty Harry series. The editing was choppy and the camera angles did not detail enough to where you could get more information. A waste of 4 hours. The story is very weak as well, it never goes anywhere, but just fills in the blanks of what was shown to you in the first scenes. Sergio Leone should take notes from Christopher Nolan on how to tell a story from the past, etc. A disappointment and waste of time. I give this film a 4/10 and that is giving the film leniancy."

It has nothing, but too much blood, sex, more blood, more sex, child molesting, more blood, more child death, child sex, more blood, more slow talks, more long shots, more blood and more molesting. Raping, killing, talking, sex in a car, more fights, more sex... I am not a sick person. This film did make me feel sick. Why was it made? No one plays here, it drags 4 hours, it leaves a heavy heart and empty brain. Not for kids, not for those who idolizes De Niro or Woods, not for Leone's fans. This is just a bad, tasteless, vapid, senseless, soulless, heartless, clueless rape of our brains. Very bad."

Cloud20,"Feb 4, 2006",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America (1984) Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Danny Aiello, Larry Rapp, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, Scott Tiler, Jennifer Connelly, Rusty Jacobs.Spoilers herein.At the start of the 80's decade, cinema had already gotten a strong start for making great films. Surrounded by tons of mindless and idiotic films from the Comedy and Horror genre that nearly ruined the decade, films like Raging Bull (my favorite of the 1980's), The Empire Strikes Back, Ordinary People and The Elephant Man were some of the best to come out of 1980. Throughout the years, others like Platoon, Rain Man, and Do the Right Thing have been hailed as some of the best of the decade. With one of the best films that has ever been brought to the screen, Once Upon a Time in America, has been constantly ignored and forgotten.Like Midnight Cowboy, The Wild Bunch, and A Clockwork Orange, Once Upon a Time in America is a turning point in its genre. It's the only film that I've seen that captures the atmosphere and tells the story so differently from others. Sergio Leone's final film, Once Upon a Time in America is actually one of the hardest films I've ever critiqued. It is all around astonishing in the sense that the film is extremely well made by Leone, in the longest film of his career.The story begins as a mystery, with several men on the search for Noodles, a Jewish gangster on the run from the men for ratting out his ""friends"". As he escapes the city, we forward to thirty-five years later to him as a senior. There, he comes back to visit a friend and look back on the regrets from his past, from his childhood to him as a younger adult, where he and his best friends rise together in the mob ranks.Leone, a perfectionist, took many years to write the screenplay. He went through script changes and re-writes many times, and never could get it exactly as he wanted it. When he was finally finished, he acted the film out himself. Objectively, Once Upon a Time in America is possibly the greatest gangster film I've ever seen along with The Godfather and Goodfellas. And it is that reason why I give him credit for giving one of the best directions in a film. His techniques obviously inspired Tarantino to go on making Pulp Fiction, and somewhat even for Martin Scorsese with Goodfellas.Leone is probably most famous for making films such as the Dollars trilogy (Fistful of Dollars; For a Few Dollars More; The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) and Once Upon a Time in the West. Here, he uses a similar storytelling like ""West"" did, except here it is far more personal into the depths of the characters. The cast is fantastic. De Niro seems rather different in this role, but is still very good. James Woods, Tuesday Weld and Elizabeth McGovern give their best roles to date.A 139-minute version was brought to the United States for a theatrical release, and was found disappointing by many critics and Leone fans in general. This version showed the film in chronological order, with many important (if intense) character pieces cut out. Ennio Morricone's (who also did the score for the Dollars trilogy) musical score is among his greatest. It is performed in haunting and beautiful ways, and it perfectly matches the film.The scenes with De Niro's behavior toward women are the ones that give the film a disturbing feel. The scenes with rape may offend some, but you have to understand why he does it before you can go on with the film. I think he did it because he never grew up learning how to treat a woman with love, and after raping the woman who he did love, he looks at the ground with guilt, and wondering to himself, what had he done wrong? Also, the character development in the film is horribly unappreciated. This is a film I just adored from the very beginning- one to expand my imagination on the characters as I did in Cinema Paradiso and City of God.I won't lie. The content in Once Upon a Time in America is extremely brutal. There are several scenes with shootings, beatings, stabbings- some even involving kids. If you can endure violence and some language- great acting, amazing directing, terrific writing, stunning cinematography, beautiful music. What more could you ask for in a great film? In the end, I would call it the greatest film of the 1980's along with Raging Bull and The Empire Strikes Back. It is an incredible cinematic masterpiece that's greatness within every year that passes. This is Leone's greatest, and sadly last, film. 5 stars out of 5."

mavilez-27907,"Dec 22, 2021",10/10,"It's too bad there were many versions released. I always believed to appreciate this movie you have to be one who enjoys a slow but meaningful movie-the Director's Cut is the best.There is so much to absorb in this movie that it compels you to see it over and over again, and by doing that it rewards you with things you missed the last time you saw it.The soundtrack is also exceptional. Ennio Morricone, may he Rest In Peace, is a genius. The music in this movie and other movies is so great they play it in orchestral concerts.The main title song is loved by my gf so much that she sometimes asks me to play on my Korg KRONOS keyboard. I love the title song too and the pan flute song, ""Cockeye's Song."""
raulito_343,"Sep 5, 2004",10/10,"Once I saw for the first time this movie, I actually didn't know anything at all of Sergio Leone, what really attracted me to watch this movie is my passion for gangster films. This movie is actually in my opinion far superior than any of the Godfather movies, movies that actually were my favorites before I saw this film (and continue to be in some sort). I discovered a new way of creating a movie by a director, that actually was not so much involved in Hollywood style cinema (from what I have read).Once Upon a time in America, its a tale of friendship, love, passion, crime, betrayal and history. I don't have that much experience reviewing movies, as a movie watcher I could tell you that there are many great movies out there, but once you encounter this masterpiece, there is no way you can compare it with other ""gangster"" films.As far I could say I have seen better movies, but no other movie could have catch my attention, this is truly one of the best movies ever made. The score, I could say was wonderful, I can't understand why this movie didn't get any Academy award, at least the score, I think that Sergio Leone had to win an academy award for best director. But the fact that this movie has some scenes that are for some people ""ugly"" like the rape scenes, this movie had a lot of bad reviews when it was first displayed.When you see this movie, and finish seeing it you will by a fact consider it too short, knowing it is 3 hours and a half, the time passes really fast, and its because its intrigue, its plot. This is actually a not very typical Hollywood movie, you could feel this is a very sad movie with an ending that won't give you a happy ending (like most of Hollywood films).Sergio Leone was by much the best director of his era, I have seen a lot of Martin Scorsese films relating to crime, but let me say it again: Not even comparable to Leone's work.Just to note, you have to see this movie twice or more to understand it, because of the changes in time, but this makes it more interesting!!10/10 2 thumbs up, 5 starseverything you have give it to this movie!! truly a masterpiece!!"
Alligator_80,"Apr 26, 2004",10/10,"""Once Upon A Time In America"" is an awesome movie to do with four Jewish men who turn from childhood thieves to adult bootleggers. This movie has a excellent cast featuring such talents as Robert De Niro, James Woods, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Larry Rapp, Joe Pesci, Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld and so on. When you do see the movie, see the ""original uncut version."" This full version runs for about 219 minutes. The Director(Sergio Leone) also directed the ""Dollars"" trilogy featuring Clint Eastwood. To sum up my review, I have created a formula for the movie: Good action sequences+ Great cast+ Excellent acting+ dramatic and touching storyline= ""Once Upon A Time In America"" (The Classic Gangster Epic- a 5/5 motion picture)!"
Powerslave-4,"Mar 14, 2004",6/10,"In a rainy boring night, I was looking some DVD´s in my living room, and by coincidence, I found Once Upon in America DVD. I´ve seen it many times, but yesterday I thought, today I will take 3 tiresome hours to evaluate this movie. In the beginning, something already doesn´t smelling good. De Niro looks meanless to me, even the young Noodles actor passed more vibration to me than him in this movie. Other characters, like Dominic, and the other boys (except the scene which Patsy eats the cake in the stairs, waiting Peg, that is wonderful) have no charism. I mean it, another mafia movies, you become friend of the criminals, in this movie, I sensed a completely lack of sense, a non-tight direction, a cold environment from the actors. Other great names, like James Woods, and even Joe Pesci, act in non-significative roles, in part, I think the screanplay was like a bad-made-puzzle, with weak explanations, bad tied, no consciousness between parts. It´s an long-movie complication, I agree. But this kind of try give a several ways to make it up and accomplish another goals, like create familiar characters, and make a lot of great drama scenes, what I missed in this movie. I unfortunately misscalculated the fame of this movie, seeing the ranking position in this site, but, in my opinion, it´s another movie to forget in my closet."
martymoves,"Aug 21, 2022",5/10,"I'm not sure what to make of this film. Maybe to properly follow it and get the full grasp, we need the entire ten to tweleve hour version. A movie with mass potential, that became a very unapologeticaly (and unnecessarily) dark and convoluted mess.I read a critic said upon original releasse it was horrible. After the 3h49m version some ten year later, was ""the best of the 80's"".There were three movies that came out in the same weekend in 1989 that were all better than this film. Critics are full of bs.This film was a horrible waste of time that I will never get back. Easily one of DeNiros worst roles. James Woods crushed it but the script and dialogue were a hot mess at best, so you have no real feel for the characters, at all.Incredibly disappointing, don't waste your time. The worst edited film I have ever seen....honestly, just horrible.A very gracious 5/10 would never watch it again!"
kerownynn,"Dec 19, 2002",N/A,"The lives of a group of Jewish gangsters from childhood to adulthood.Once Upon a Time in America is dismissed as an overrated film by many, which I can understand.  It's very long, lacks dialogue and characters seem less engaging than in other gangster flicks - certainly not the kind you might see in a Scorsese picture.  These are not necessarily large flaws in a film created by the master Leone, however.Once Upon a Time in America is an exercise in cinematic brilliance.  Each scene is memorable and extracts the desired effect from the viewer.  I was enthralled with each moment.Over 200 minutes might be a stretch for the attention span of today's viewing audience, but not for those who have a strong interest in film, and know Leone's career.Once Upon a Time in America is not only a classic film, it is a summation of every gangster film before it.  A pitch-perfect movie, and one that definitely ranks among the Godfather."
mak_600,"Jan 12, 2010",10/10,"I first saw this film back in 1985 as an 18 year old and was simply blown away by it despite parts of it leaving me in the dark as to what the hell was going on! Since then i've watched it many times and over those repeated viewings i've come to understand more and more what the film is about and what the characters and story represent. But that is my take on it and as such, one of the beautiful things about this film is that people, i feel, will take what they want from it depending on how much time and attention they want to put into it. In simple terms this is not a film you can watch just the once - if you do you will feel confused and probably let down. Persevere, watch it again though and most likely you will start to ""get it""...Because of this i think OUATIA could truly be a unique cinematic experience, something you really have to delve into and immerse yourself in otherwise you will not come to recognise and spot the nuances or the messages contained within. It's not so much a gangster flick in the obvious sense, more a story told of love lost and lives wasted, friendships forged and ultimately betrayed. Much has already been said about the cinematography, the score, the sets and the acting of which all are truly first class even allowing perhaps for my slight reservations on McGovern. The child actors for me are every bit as good as the seasoned pros and Jennifer Connelly is simply wonderful.The film has flaws absolutely, but what again makes this a unique experience is that those flaws (for me anyway) just add to the mystique of the film rather than take anything away. It's not mean't to be a historically correct story-telling anyway and the reviewer elsewhere who bemoaned the bridge not being the Brooklyn bridge or some such is so missing the point, as do the few who from their words you can tell have just not taken the time to really watch and involve themselves. Maybe some people will just never get it anyway...!To sum up this is a film for those who are prepared to give more of their time, thought and effort to it than just your normal 120 minute Hollywood banality ride demands. If you truly love cinema and have the patience to give it the attention it deserves you will i'm sure be richly rewarded. In the 25 years since first seeing this masterpiece i've yet to be as affected by any other film in quite the same way..."
PCT1970,"May 8, 2019",8/10,"Leone helms a virtuous epic film in the crime / drama genre. This film has excellent direction, screenplay, editing, cinematography, score and acting. There are many famous artists involved in this film and they deliver superlative and realistic performances. De Niro and Woods in particular are superb. The plot revolves around a former gangster, Noodles, who returns to New York after disappearing four decades earlier to start a new life and for other reasons. The plot initially hints as to why Noodles left New York, but after his return we learn the entire story as seen through his own flashbacks. We see Noodles and his friends growing up in a Jewish slum in New York's Lower East Side. Noodles, a natural leader, rises to bootlegger and ultimately a Mafia boss. This does not come without violence, betrayal and remorse. The film does a magnificent job examining all of the characters and what makes them tick. The plot is gripping, intense, violent, gritty, bloody, duplicitous and has a cathartic ending. This is a sprawling story and thus turns into a lengthy and entertaining film which Leone is known for to begin with. It is a masterful work of art, memorable, timeless and a classic. This film takes a different path, as far as the storyline, than most traditional gangster films which is refreshing. This viewer has revisited this film many times and in my opinion it is bravura in it's genre and holds it's own with the other celebrated gangster / mob films."
marshall_hill_bruce,"Jan 29, 2020",10/10,One of the best movies I've ever watched. Seeing a lot of negative reviews lately - as if people nowdays can't sit trough something longer than 90 minutes.But this movie is masterpiece from legend director Sergio Leone.
cianbalfe,"Aug 3, 2022",10/10,"Wow.I did not expect it to be that good. The music throughout the film is brilliant, the story was superb from the start.The duration of the film was daunting because I really had to free up my day to watch a 4 hour film. Well I got covid so I had a lot of time on my hands.People this is not a drill it is well worth the watch, James Woods and Robert de Niro are outstanding together in this film and really captures the brutality of New York in those troubling years."
bladerunnerd-1,"Aug 5, 2004",6/10,"I think Leone took a great amount of water over his head on this one. The cuts get annoying at times, and the 'flow' of the story gets 'chopped'. I enjoyed it at some amount, but this does not stand out to be the best of Leone. The movie struggles to keep me interested at times... and thats not a good sign. All the actors do a good job, but I have seen them all better... I don't think I'll watch this one again in a long time... but should be watched once by all, if nothing else, just too have seen it. The playing time should also have been cut by half an hour. I gave it a 6/10. It's is all in all average. Maybe I expected too much.Peace . Out."
serpentetriste,"Nov 4, 2002",10/10,One of the best films every time. There are two versions of this film. The USA version was a disaster whereas the european one (240 minutes length) is a very masterpiece. This is the best film of Sergio Leone. To understand the film in all parts I suggest to view it twice.
hwm-05554,"Sep 19, 2021",6/10,"Super slow pacing, unnecessary brutality and multiple rape scenes. The plot is mediocre at best and confusing. Some of the characters reactions in certain situations are unrealistic and overall there are multiple scenes in the movie that aren't convincing.I recommend you go watch ""Once upon a time in the west"" instead, which actually is an excellent movie."
jack.hunter,"Dec 24, 2003",5/10,"What a disappointment this film continues to be.  The first time I viewed the film many years ago I attributed its failure to being too severely edited for time constraint reasons.  I was wrong.  This new extended version just adds another hour or so of more confusion and general boredom.  What a waste.  This film has some of the finest production values you could ever hope for.  Some of the sets are like time capsules. However, unfortunately for the this viewer the movie comes off as often incoherent and self-indulgent.  Some reviewers seem to like Morricone's soundtrack.  I personally found it to be extremely grating.  Don't be mislead, ""The Godfather"" trilogy this isn't.  A true waste of a lot of time for the viewer and a collossal waste of movie making talent."
oneflewovertheapocalypse,"Apr 3, 2004",N/A,Sergio Leone already had about 5 films before this which were masterpieces and as it was his last film we expect nothing less and that's what we got. Once Upon a Time in America is quite an unusual tale of Gangster's growing up.   It was one of it kind for it's narrative story being chopped up into different parts so we don't really get meaning of the plot till the very end.The story has to be one of the most beautiful stories I have ever heard and a depressing one at that.   It has everything you want in a story as it keeps you guessing and wondering throughout it's nearly 4 hour run but without it being that long it would have never have been that good.   This was different for Sergio Leone as we usually expect to see all his characters living in the west and wearing ponchos but what he brought to the screen in 1984 was probably the greatest gangster film of all time even beating the likes of The Godfather and Scarface.   I once said that Goodfellas was the greatest gangster film ever but that was before I saw Once Upon a Time in America.   Before this was released on DVD did anyone find it hard to find the original copy?  I couldn't find it and it was becoming incurably frustrating as I ran sacked all the Car Boot Sales to try and bag myself a copy and I then come across this man on a market stall and asked if he had a copy and he said he's got one at home and he'll bring it in for me next time he is there.   I agreed to this and asked him what his price was and he said £20 and this is for a VHS which in my opinion a classic or not is daylight robbery so I was back to square one.  The angels were listening though as a couple of weekends later they showed it on BBC 2 and I got to witness one of the greatest films ever made but it just astounds me that this movie was so rare to own after it was released in the mid eighties and even then it was a cut version so I had to rely on the TV to come up trumps with it's full version and lucky for me it did.There are some heartbreaking scenes here especially when Noodles rapesDeborah only because he knows he can't have her any other way but I think it's great how Leone let's us get to know Noodles for him to then turn his back on us and show us his evil side by raping her or attempting to I couldn't really tell if he did or not.   There is no future as far as love goes for Noodles as he doesn't know how to feel it after so much rejection. He is a broken man and is desperate for Deborah to love him but she resists only for him to do that to her.Robert De Niro's performance is one of the best of his career especially when he is an older man because his eyes do all the talking as his age goes and his movements from place to place when reminiscing is just brilliant as the more he moves the more guilt runs through him.   He is a lost soul and doesn't see anyway of putting his past behind and getting one with the future.  His past haunts him and he won't let it rest as he grows more suspicious trying to find out why he was invited back to his hometown after being obsolete for the past 30 years and whilst that is happening he is trying to find out the truth and while this is going on we see how his life has come upon him in flashback.   De Niro is not the only reason we should watch this but James Woods also as he gives the performance of his career as Noodles best friend Max.   Once Upon a Time in America may come across slow in parts and when it's your first time it may not even make any sense to you anyway as it did me.  It took me at least three watches to get what happened and what was De Niro's smile all about but once you have got past all that and have really taken it in you will see that Leone didn't make a great film before he died but he made one of the greatest films ever made.
mjg32,"Mar 3, 2007",10/10,"Sergio Leone's last film was also his best, with this epic life story of two best friends who work together as gangsters. Whether it is a real life story, or simply Noodles' drug-induced dreams is never resolved, but this and the film's non-chronological order add to its effectiveness. The usual brilliant camera-work of Leone's films, and the wonderful musical score by Ennio Morricone are a wonderful accompaniment to the strong violence and character's emotions. The story takes you through all the emotions, but ultimately leaves you feeling happy that you have viewed such a masterpiece. The acting of not just De Niro and James Woods, but all the characters, young and old, is superb and at no point does the storyline become overlong or boring. At 220 minutes, it takes some watching, but believe me it is well worth it. This is one of the best ever gangster films, a true masterpiece from one of the world's greatest directors, and was a perfect sign off for Leone."
aaraanb-16534,"Aug 2, 2021",9/10,After so many years of people recommending me to watch this movie I finally decided to watch it. I watched the 3hr 49 min version of this film as this was the only one that was available to me.The first half of this film with Noodles and Max as children was very good and quite enjoyable. My favorite shots were during this section of the film. The second half as adults played by Robert De Niro and James Woods was still good but not quite as enjoyable as the first half. De Niro and Woods were both great in this film.Sergio Leone did a hell of a job creating this film. The cinematography by Tonino Delli Colli and the musical score by Ennio Morricone were fantastic. My favorite shot is the one where the child gang were walking past the street with the bridge in the background. My favorite piece from the soundtrack is Poverty.This film isn't without its problems though as I felt the pacing was a little slow at times as this film is over 3 hours and some plot holes in the story. Like what happened to the police officer who was blackmailed by Noodles and Max?I've seen a lot of people saying this film was better than The Godfather and Goodfellas and I can see why but it's a no from me. By the end of this film I was exhausted. I don't even want to watch the directors cut after finding out it is 4hrs 19 mins. I've seen the LOTR extended editions but they were far more enjoyable than this film and didn't feel like long. This movie could've cut off at least 10 minutes of footage.Overall great movie but too long.9/10 the cinematography and music brought it this high. If those were mediocre this would've been a much lower score.
Soumay_Bansal,"Jun 1, 2019",10/10,"It is one of the best movies of all time. And the greatest crime movie of all time. i saw 251 minute edition. Each and every seen is incredibly moving. Sergio Leone was overlooked on each and every occasion. He deserved every directors award that is in existence, for this movie. Long live Sergio Leone's art, talent and directing skills."
mentalcritic,"Jun 20, 2006",10/10,"Don't get me wrong, I love The Godfather and all, but the story does not suit Sergio Leone's unique and distinctly European style of direction. Once Upon A Time In America, on the other hand, was a story practically made for the man. Running at over three and a half hours in the most complete cut known to exist today, its pace might be leisurely and its action incidental, but one other thing it has in common with other Leone films is that it is never slow or boring. As a film about gangsters, it is a fine example. As a film about looking back upon the twists and turns life can take, it is a masterpiece. Although there are moments when its sets or props reveal the time the film was shot in, OUATIA is a timeless exploration of how the bonds between boys stretch, alter, and even break as they become men. The tagline (""As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did."") is surprisingly accurate in summarising the film in spite of the fact that it gives very little away. It was Leone's last film, and a more fitting memorial simply does not exist in the medium.Ironically, for a film directed by a man who has yet to be equalled for using the 2.35:1 frame in a dynamic fashion, Once Upon A Time In America is the first film Leone shot in the 1.85:1 ratio. I have to confess the cinematography disappointed me somewhat, with this narrower composition clearly allowing fewer opportunities for creative crowd shots. However, there still are fine examples abound of why a film should never be pared down to fit the box-like television that is now thankfully on its way into the kind of nostalgic past that this film spends a lot of its time depicting. Complementing the visuals is a score by Ennio Morricone that, while recalling shades of C'era Una Volta Il West, also provides a more subtle, emotional undercurrent for the visuals. The strings and choir heard when a rather young Jennifer Connelly is visible remind one of the haunting soloist heard when Jill McBain steps out into the train station being built at the end of the aforementioned C'era Una Volta Il West, only it is just as good and far more restrained.Of course, no film can be what it is without actors, and Once Upon A Time In America has some of the best. The featurette included with the DVD-Video edition features James Woods describing how privileged he feels to have worked with Leone, and his performance in the film indicates he felt that way from the first. De Niro is also impeccable as the adult Noodles, portraying a young man, a middle-aged man, and an elderly man filled with regret using equal levels of skill and artistry. But in a contrast to Leone's other films, the surprise here is in the bit parts, where even the small walk-ons are portrayed with aplomb. Also surprising are the performances of the youngsters who portray our heroes during the earlier stages of the story. The aforementioned Connelly is a delight to watch, but Scott Tiler and Rusty Jacobs excel as youthful versions of De Niro and Woods. Even if you dispute Leone's composition and writing skills, one thing this film erases all doubts about is his ability to choose the right actors for the roles. Or perhaps he just brought out the very best in people.Roger Ebert has said that editing is the soul of the cinema. He also said it was The Brown Bunny's salvation. In the case of Once Upon A Time In America, excessive editing was its damnation. For some reason too illogical to contemplate, the distributors chose to cut OUATIA from its intended length down to a little more than two hours. As Ebert has also mentioned, this decision, as well as that to arrange the scenes in a chronological fashion, made the film seem far longer than the more complete 229-minute cut, and also deprived it of that critical ability to make sense. If you hear someone telling you that this film is lousy or not well-paced, make sure to ask them which version they have seen. Leone has said that he would have liked the film to be anywhere from 250 to 265 minutes. One can only wonder what this other footage would have revealed, but alas, it is in a raw and possibly unusable state. Leone reportedly wished to finish these scenes for a future release, but we all know what happened next, sadly.The use of transitions is also nothing short of brilliant. Early in the film, we hear a telephone ringing quite persistently, and the first twenty or so minutes feel quite disjointed. It is a testament to how well the film comes together that not only do all the pieces fit together like a sports car, the sound of a telephone ringing later in the film feels quite ominous. It is also a testament to the makeup artists' skill that Robert De Niro and James Woods appear at the chronological end of the film looking so old and ragged. About the only slip-up is that several of the main characters change eye-colour when they switch from their adult to child incarnations, and vice versa. For a younger cinemaphile seeing the film for the first time, it can be fun simply to see actors we have been taught to revere in the roles they played before they made portraying mobsters seem routine. After seeing OUATIA, I have developed a whole new appreciation for James Woods as an actor.Out of ten, OUATIA is an unqualfied ten. Were I asked to choose a hundred films to send to an alien planet to demonstrate the creativity of mankind, at least two of them would be Leone's work, and OUATIA is certainly one of them."
irajoel,"Apr 4, 2001",10/10,"Its inconceivable to me, how anyone viewing this great film in its 4 hour version could not be moved, excited & ultimately overwhelmed by it. From the opening with that Goddamn ringing phone, to the last shot of a smiling stoned out DeNiro this film is a true work of art. Complicated & personal, Leone weaves an epic tale about a bunch of Jewish gangster-friends from their criminal childhood on New York's lower eastside in the 1900's to the 1960's. And like many films of the genre,Once Upon touches on the themes of friendship, loyalty & betrayal but does so in what some find an unsettling structure. The film constantly weaves from past to present and back again & I think that this form of filmmaking makes some American moviegoers uneasy. They like their films with beginnings, middles & hopefully happy endings. Now this is a film that is all over the place, with characters that come & go impolitely & age without aging. Leone the artist takes a sacred genre and does marvelous tricks & turns to it. Its also a very violent & sexy film, a little too ""European"" for a mainstream American film, so the film is butched down to a 2 hour version that gets bombed by critics, and hated by audiences who came expecting another Godfather sequel, because hey after all DeNiro is in it. Also in the film is James Woods & the always great Tuesday Weld. The music is by Ennio Morricone & the beautiful cinematography is by Tonino Delli Colli. I'm delighted to see how many positive and interesting comments this film has gotten here, and I too can't wait for it to be on DVD. There is also a longer version than the 4 hour one, in which Louise Flecher has a part, I've seen the stills."
apzijlstra,"Feb 1, 2012",7/10,"The 229 minute version of Once Upon a Time in America is too long because there is a repetitiveness in the presentation of the themes. Having said that, it is also true that the attention to detail and the lavish sets make the nearly four our of watching never a chore. Then there is also Robert De Niro who lifts the movie above an ordinary gangster flick. Arguably, one of the best things about the movie is the music, but since God Bless America was used so movingly in the ending of The Deer Hunter (also with De Niro), it was in poor taste to use it as the final song six years later again so stridently. The actors playing the gangsters as boys and those playing the gangsters as adults are all fine. With all that, what a pity that the movie finally fails. It does so in the sense that the ending is a farce, something that sits poorly with an epic movie, and it does so in the sense that it makes the mistake of practicing alchemy, of distilling friendship and love and sensitivity from a group of extraordinary vicious men, murderers whose sense of humor is expressed in swapping babies in a nursery. The viewer is asked to believe that these cockroaches are capable of great sensitivity. Deborah calls one of them a cockroach early on and she should have taken herself more seriously for she could have known she was right. The director wanted it both ways, violence and love undiluted from the same source. Kiss kiss, bang bang: it can be done, but not like this."
du_man,"Jun 5, 2003",10/10,"Rating  * * * 1/2Sergio Leone made no movies from 1975 until this film came out... and it was his final classic.  Before, he had virtually created the Spaghetti Western-- along with Clint Eastwood and composer Ennio Morricone.  In fact, Leone turned down the chance to direct ""The Godfather"" in order to make this.And he made a true masterpiece.The plot is, as usual for Leone's films, extremely complex.  It starts in 1933, flashes forward to 1968, then back to the earliest days of the 1900s.  It concerns four Jewish friends who are involved in crime even as children.  They stay friends until adulthood, when two of them, Noodles (Robert de Niro) and psychotic Max (James Woods) begin to have differences, though they were the closest as children.It's hard to think of anything wrong with this film.  There is one, however.  It goes on for 227 minutes.  Not that it's ever boring.  It just has too much of a few things.  Example: was all the stuff with prostitutes absolutely necessary?  Still, the fact that you can still respect Noodles after he rapes a woman is one show of Leone's brilliance.Other than too much sex and violence, there really isn't much wrong with this film.  It did certainly deserve its R rating (for more than just those reasons), but it is still a classic.The performances are outstanding.  De Niro and Woods are two of the best film actors alive today.  De Niro matched Marlon Brando as Vito Corleone in ""The Godfather Part II,"" was incredible in ""The Score,"" and was absolutely hilarious in ""Meet the Parents.""  These are only three of his best.  But Once Upon a Time is America is his best.  Ditto for Woods, who actually saved one of Sylvester Stallone's worst films, ""The Specialist,"" with an incredible performance.  And this here is his best.Some of the scenes are truly touching, others horrifying.  The final half-hour, where an aged Noodles tries to find out who ruined his life thirty-five years earlier.  The final meeting between Noodles and Max is one of the best filmed scenes ever.Still, it would not be a classic without Ennio Morricone's score.  He is probably the best one out there, and this is probably his best.  It is absolutely beautiful and one of the greatest film scores ever.Also helping is the incredible production design.  It really captures the period, nearly as well as the score.This crime drama is stunning in every way.  Every way.How this did not sweep the '84 Oscars is beyond me.This is a true masterpiece, and Leone's last.You have to see this film."
caspian1978,"Dec 16, 2015",6/10,"Once Upon a Time in America is the perfect example of a Hollywood film that you hate to love. An obedient film lover will make a list of many reasons why this movie is great. Why it should be on your list of movies to watch and why it should be considered an important work of cinema can be debated and defended time and time again. Still, many will agree that the movie falls short in many ways to be considered a classic. Fans and critics will both agree that Once Upon a Time in American will easily confuse its audience without hardly any trouble. A period piece that jumps around from decade to decade will alone make the time-line confusing to any audience. Throw in character motivation and you have a roller coaster of confusion and endless questioning. With a blockbuster cast of some of the most talented names in Hollywood, and a legendary film maker, it's hard to acknowledge that the end result would be anything less that great. With Once Upon a Time in America, it is just that. Many will support the imperfectness that the movie is by showcasing the several different edited versions and why the final version came to being. Then again, whether or not each version tells a different story, the overall structure of the story still remains. No matter if we have 3 hour or 6 hour version, we are still left with empty characters from the very beginning. With all its faults and mystery that both versions have, the plot, the theme and many of its characters have holes. The potential Once Upon a Time in America had with its reach as a cinematic triumph, falls short from anything spectacular. What could have been one of the best 'American' films, falls among the many mobster flicks which does not do this movie justice. Although the cons do outweigh the pros, the movie holds up with many moments of beauty."
unixgeek13,"Jul 10, 2003",N/A,"I have a category of movies in my life that I call ""accidental movies"". AM's are flicks that I never really intended to watch, never heard of prior to seeing, etc. OUATIA is such a movie to me. I had never heard of it, was up way too late one night and this showed up on HBO starting at like 2am. I was blessed by the HBO-gods that they were presenting what used to be called ""the long version"" or ""the European version"". Of course, I watched every minute of it. It was fascinating. I couldn't figure out how I had never heard of this movie. So many of my favorite actors in one place! DeNiro... Woods... Pesci... Williams... Because of this movie, I fell in love with Elizabeth McGovern... rediscovered Tuesday Weld, and was introduced to William Forsythe.The movie is a marathon at its full length, but well worth the time invested to watch it. It provides a reasonably faithful historical backdrop to the action of the main group of childhood friends, and sees them through many stages of their lives.Are you familiar with the Bruce Springsteen song ""57 Channels and Nothing On""? Well... the reality of digital cable is that it's 257 channels and STILL nothing on. On those nights, I go back to my old standby, OUATIA. I have now seen this movie at least twenty times. The beauty of an epic is that even at the twentieth viewing, you can find little nuances that you previously missed. I really think of this movie as an old friend that is always there to visit with. I once watched a cable broadcast of the edited version, and even with my knowledge of the movie, found it impossible to follow.If you have never seen this wonderful movie, you owe it to yourself to gather up your best snacks, plant a full cooler next to your best movie chair, send the kids off to their grandparents AND ENJOY!"
DhavalVyas,"Aug 27, 2004",10/10,"'Once Upon a Time in America' is quite simply the best gangster movie I have seen and is one of the greatest movies ever made. The entire story is like a long, beautiful, haunting, and scary dream. By the end of the film, it feels like I've witnessed the entire lives of the characters. It feels like I understood their every joy and sadness, triumph and frustration. The picture presented by Sergio Leone is bleak, but it is appropriate considering the subject matter. It manages to cover over 50 years of time, but the movie does not seem long at all.Robert DeNiro play Noodles, an aging man who can't forget the sins of the past. Just by looking at his face, I could sense the burden of a lifetime of mistakes, lost livelihood and friendships. An all around brilliant film and quite possibly a masterpiece."
nihao,"Jun 17, 2012",9/10,"Injustice. This film deals with it, this film suffered it. Leone and his team never saw a single Oscar for what is, undoubtedly, one of the GREAT movies of film history. Supposedly the reason was that HIS version was far too long, and 'unapetizing' for the American public. Years later, this seems ridiculous. American cinema has topped the record for gore and 'unhealthy' material. And DVD finally gave us O.U.a T. in A. in its glorious entirety. And complexity. Yes, because this script is so perfect, so stimulating and so bewitching, that although I have seen the movie 3 times in the last 30 years, it still surprises me...adds nuances and revelations to it's original story. truly admirable! The facade of good ole, healthy America is severely battered by this story of unhealthy ambition, betrayal, revenge and power. 'Noodles' De Niro (the nick-name of our 'positive' protagonist reminds us that Leone was the king of 'spaghetti' westerns), returns, twice, to the site of past crimes... risking his life and ideals in the process. The savagely bitter finale remind us that he does so, simply because he is 'curious'. Because he NEEDS the truth. And this need, although painful, is necessary. Guilt, it is implied, is a powerful corrosive agent, however icy James Woods' character may be. There is , whatsmore, a sub-text which Sergio Leone works on here, and it is the role of DRUGS in society. In order to bear the injustice and treason, the violence and solitude that life has dealt out, Noodles resorts to Opium, as a source of relief; of contemplation. Could it be that the director is reminding us that Heroin's reign in Italy and in the U.S. during the 70ies and 80ies may closely reflect 'modern' Society's degradation? As always, Leone blends his political criticism of the American way with a strong misogynist vein. His women are few and far between in the westerns, but in the two 'Once upon a time..."" movies they are increasingly present, and increasingly foxy. The are either prostitutes or cock-teasers with a strong masochist element. And it seems he prefers the 'honest whore'. This film could be reviewed by a psychoanalyst, a priest, a gangster or a politician , and all, I'm sure, would offer a different reading, as in Kurosawa's 'Rashomon'. But Leone is NOT a subtle film-maker. And maybe this reputation of his as something of a gangster in the, very selective Italian league of the 60 ies and 70ies, cheated him out of the credit he receives only now. Somewhat like Ken Russell in the British panorama, Leone's stylish but brutal approach to the realities of life, hurt the shyly hypocritical sensitivities of public and censors alike... let alone the distributors' in Hollywood. Technically the movie is breathtaking, especially Pescucci's wardrobe, Rochetti's make-up (the aging jobs are almost all superlative, and fundamental in helping us deal with such a complex game of 'flash-backs'), the Greg Tolland-style photography and shots by Tonino Delli Colli, the sets, editing and...of course, dulcis-in-fundo, Ennio Morricone's timeless score which, once again, is part and parcel of the film, an emotional bomb which Leone knowingly 'drops' in all the right moments. Deborah's theme is crushing. And the brilliant use of music and silence in Noodles' visit to his friend's mausoleum... comic and audacious. So, it's 9 out of 10, given that the perfect film may not exist (Jean Vigo's 'L'Atalante' ?), and the nearest thing to reading a GREAT novel, but with the whole 'caboodle' of the art of our time. Il Grande Cinema.p.s. It is absolutely extraordinary that an Italian,a ROMAN, with a VERY limited grasp of the English language, should endeavour, and pull off, such an ambitious American fresco. His great talent, and that of Mr. Brian Freilino (who helped him coach and survey the realism of nuances in both languages), and of the dialogue writers, greatly surpass the occasional hiccups that we encounter, especially in the childhood scenes. and by the way, ALL praise to the young actors who unjustly precede De Niro and Woods, but only chronologically."
axismladen,"May 11, 2010",10/10,"Once Upon A Time In America is, as Leone hoped it will be, his best movie! It's perfect!Many of you might wonder why this movie wasn't present at the ACADEMY AWARD'S. It's because of the producer's and Warner Bros, who ordered Leone to cut more than one hour of the movie for it's theatrical(original) release. It really ruins the movie. My most honest recommendation is that you see the ''director's version''! That version of the movie is simply magnificent! The director's version is the biggest rival The Godfather has and will ever have! It's simply perfect! True, it is long! But the movie is so good that the time will just fly! Trust me! I've seen it more than ten times and i'm still not bored. It's simply perfect! Not that the theatrical version isn't good, it's just that it's not even as close as good as the director's cut! And literally, not as close as good!!! It takes away the movies structure and leaves a lot of holes in the script! It ruin's it! It's still good, but it's no longer brilliant!I don't think it's necessary to say anything about acting! Just look at the cast!This movie is for everyone out there. This movie is a brutally honest story of a couple of friend's growing up together in a society that gives 'em no other choice but to become gangster's. Also there is a beautifully written love story in the background which comes to most unexpected twist. And i have to mention characterization! It's flawless! Simply perfect! -- Just as the entire movie is in the director's version!"
Thanos_Alfie,"Feb 1, 2015",8/10,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a crime movie which shows a former gangster who returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan after thirty years. He has to deal with some changes that happened and he missed all of those. We watch also the past of him and how all of these start and of course all of that has to do with the mafia and the gangs of New York.I really liked this movie because of the plot which I found magnificent and the direction of Sergio Leone which was outstanding. About the interpretations I have to say that the interpretation of Robert De Niro who played as David Aaronson (Noodles) was for one more time great, equally good interpretation made by James Woods who played as Maximilian Bercovicz (Max). Another good interpretation that has to be mentioned is the beautiful Elizabeth McGovern's who played as Deborah Gelly. This movie reminded me plenty of movies with the same plot, gangsters, mafia etc but this movie was simply one of the best in this kind.Finally I believe that ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is one of the best movies that a crime movies fan wants to watch. It gives you many emotions and this happens because of the interpretations of the cast but also from the great direction of this movie."
moviefiend!,"Aug 29, 2010",6/10,"I've seen better gangster movies. The artistic style of the director drags some scenes along waaaayyy too long. At times it seems as though you're watching a daytime soap opera. The rape scene wasn't just hard to watch because of the content. It was hard to watch because after about 30 seconds I'm thinking to myself, ""enough already, we get it!"" The other issue I had with this one was the flashforwards and flashbacks intertwined with DeNiro's character. At times it was hard initially to recognize which time period the film had shifted into from one scene to the next. This is especially true at the end of the movie when one female character appears to not have aged a day.It's not worth your time to watch the director's cut. Rent/Buy The Godfather, Casino, or Goodfellas instead.-moviefiend!"
alfstadj,"Nov 11, 2021",N/A,Good story/music. I like it better than most Gangster movies. Probably would bump it up to a 9 if there was a consistently ringing phone for 5 minutes.
Quentin_Tarantinno,"Sep 6, 2005",10/10,"Once Upon A Time is a great epic about the life of a Jewish gangster. It is a story about friendship and betrayal.The first time I watched this movie, I was so confused and frustrated, disturbing opening scenes, complex and detailed plot and a shocking end.For a second view, I got the whole picture, the opening and ending scenes began to make sense, the chronological order of the story was comprehended.I needed a third view to begin feeling the music of this film, and then the magic of ""Once Upon A Time In America"" caught me. I was fascinated by that wonderful soundtrack, the long scenes, regarded by some as boring, became more meaningful now, thanks to a great background music, which set a unique, intense and charged atmosphere, and that's what is so special about this film. It would have never been a masterpiece without Ennio Morricone's work.Once the story is understood, you feel more the intensity of it and some of the scenes become more emotionally involving. You will be attached to the atmosphere of the film to an extent that whenever you decide to watch a scene you'll continue to the end of the movie. I entered a whole new world for a week, the world of the American dream.OUATIA is a great cinematic achievement to be compared along with the great ones, one of the movies that resemble to myths, they grow in debate from generation to another, but the important thing is that you give the movie the time it deserves, because if you're not emotionally involved and focused on it you will be lost, frustrated and you'll probably hate it. But, if you concentrate from the beginning till the end and give the experience the adequate state of mind, you'll be amazed by what you'll get through.10/10. A must see movie, A great experience."
slimecity-38663,"May 2, 2018",9/10,Its a bit dated with some of its treatment of issues including how to treat women properly (!) But it as a nice slow pace and a great story.

This film is god speaking to us through art."
Spondonman,"Jun 16, 2007",9/10,"This is an unforgettable roller-coaster ride, a mammoth 217 minutes (UK TV runtime) of love, hate, friendship and memories (Leone's words). And routine bestiality. Leone brought to the American gangster movie all he had given to the American Western movie in the preceding two decades, leaving this stuck out somewhere between The Good Bad And The Ugly and The Godfathers. I've only ever seen the full European cut (still well edited down from Leone's original), I assume the original cut US cut is the one that draws the bad reviews.Disjointed story set in 1968, 1923 and 1933 has handsome chap Noodles played by DeNiro being called back from self-imposed exile to his old stomping ground by someone after decades of hiding, he wants to find out by who and why. Although he turns out to have been a vicious murdering rapist gangster when young we have to root for him as he's really the best of a bad lot. We're treated to lengthy arty flashbacks and many heavy poignant moments, softly tender scenes giving way to scenes of brutal sadism  all in the name of so-called Realism. This, remember, is via persistence of vision viewed on a two-dimensional screen, with a fictional plot contrived to fit logically into a timeslot complemented by a stirring orchestral soundtrack you'd never get in Real Life. Leone himself said he never tried to make realist films, so why pile on the violence and smut? And to crown it all, within is a woman who apparently ""age cannot wither"". Morricone excelled himself with his score for this  like Cinema Paradiso, the film could simply not stand on its own without it, the repetitive and relentlessly moving and melancholic main themes, especially Deborah's Theme can leave you in tears and yet sometimes you don't know why. And they ""forgot"" to enter it into the Oscars nominations  Doh! Also the lush orchestral version of Amapola in the dinner for 2 sequence can give you a lump in your throat, though make the most of it because the dreamlike spell is ruthlessly broken in the back of the car come the dawn. DeNiro was perfect for the role of Noodles, his highly visible semi-intelligent thought processes struggling along but almost creating a few longueurs at times. The climax seemed a bit fast with all that had gone before  you might even call it a rubbish ending (hem)  but it still fitted in well. Even the static 6 minute end credits with Morricone's music is worth watching!A helluva lot happens in these 4 hours, good and bad and happy and sad  overall brooding melancholia spurred by memories of mistakes made. I love it with all its faults, and even though at times it makes me wince it's definitely a masterpiece."
FloriMajlen,"Feb 23, 2021",10/10,"I came across this film last year and I constantly delayed watching it, because I thought I didn't have enough time and patience to watch. Oh, how foolish I was. This is the last film by master Sergio Leone, whose filmmaking knowledge is almost god-like, and what a way to finish one's career. It contains probably the cruelest depiction of mafia I've ever seen and it is as realistic as it should be. One of the themes of this film is friendship and bond that these guys once had. As their bond was broken, nothing remained the same. This is a valuable lesson, indeed. Shame on WB studio which cut this masterpiece and made blurry and tragic version without any flashbacks, which ruined Leone's reputation and career. Again, this film is an absolute pleasure and I can't wait to see it again!"
keanep619,"Jul 30, 2009",6/10,"I think this film scored so high on the ratings due to the cast, makers and the yet another mob film.Put simply this film is incredibly long and incredibly tedious.As always cast are great, but you can only work with what you are given. Not even in the same league as good fellas, untouchables, godfather, Donnie bras co etc etc.Not 100% sure on length but if i remember correctly it is in the region of 4 hours, and for a film to be of this length AND keep the audience interested takes a lot. The story could have been told in half the time.I gave this film a rating of 10 as I believe it is far from justifiable to reward this film as highly as it has been."
BleekersPorkSword,"May 8, 2004",9/10,"The other review was so off I had to say something. First off this is a gangsta film of epic proportion. It is rich with drama, dialogue and the most beautiful score ever written. Although the length of the film is intimidating I strongly encourage those who enjoyed it to watch it again. There is just so much happening here you wont pick everything up upon the first viewing. The main character Noodles (De Niro) is everything you could want. He is a hero and a dispicable person at times. I use the word hero because of my fascination with the crime genre. You must respect the drive of a man who rises from poverty to success no matter how it's done. Similar to Michael Corleone in the Godfather you cant help but to love the blurred line of Good Guy/Bad Guy in the complex character that is Noodles. You will swear you are in the 1920's or 30's Leone is a genius director and this is not only his finest achievment but one of the greatest motion pictures ever made. Ive seen Once Upon a Time in America over 20 times and it never gets old orloses its effect.Also ask yourself one question after the movie... Why is Noodles smiling at the very end?...keep watching and thinking, you'll figure it out. - Ben"
brfeitosa,"Aug 31, 2023",4/10,"Long scenes that don't add to mood, character arc, motif, aesthetic or anything else that I would expect from a film. Mostly reticle acting, some OK. The story itself just seems to me like a bunch of bros dealing with their stupid ideas and regretting some of them, but mostly just acting like total a**holes. The rest of society seems to think that they're cool or something, and they don't seem to have very good reason to even survive in their own world, so they basically drift between intensifying chaos and doing whatever they feel like. I didn't hate the movie, but I did hate wasting more than 3 hours watching such nonsense just to get some obvious metaphors that have been drilled on any other b-movie. Not worth it."
david-good-1,"Jun 27, 2003",N/A,"Once Upon A Time In America is my favourite film, bar none of all time.. This picture is, in my opinion, Sergio Leone's finest achievement -his masterpiece. The movie can be viewed in several different ways and on quite a few different levels. For what it's worth these are my thoughts: This is the second loose trilogy that Leone made (The first being the Dollars trilogy - A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly)**The second trilogy being Once Upon a Time in The West( The building of the railroad between the East and West coasts of America ) A Fistful of Dynamite or Duck You Sucker or as it was called in France, Once Upon A Time The Revolution ( the Mexican Revolution ) and finally Once Upon A Time In America ( the Prohibition Era of 1920's and 1930's America.) These were in Leone's opinion the 3 most important periods in the history of the U.S. The film starts and ends in 1933 - although goes forward to 1968 and then back to 1923 - then back and forth throughout the story. Time is the most important character as the story unfolds. It is a fairy tale for adults...if you want the film can be viewed an an opium dream in Noodles' (Robert De Niro's) mind. If the film is looked at in this light, the fact that Elizabeth McGovern's character does not seem to age between 1933 and 1968 makes more sense. Another clue to the film's use of dream imagery is that the number 35 appears on the garbage truck at the end of the film (This is the number of years that Noodles was hiding out and spending the intervening years between 1933 and 1968.) Also when Noodles first returns to New York's Lower East Side and meets Fat Moe (Larry Rapp)-he gives him back the key to Moe's clock. This is then used to wind up the clock (and start time moving again so that the rest of the story can be told) In many ways the film is only told from Noodles viewpoint...we only find out that during his 35 years in hiding he was ""..going to bed early.."" Ennio Morricone's music score is haunting - about 2/3 of the music was composed prior to the film being shot - and, as was common on a lot of Leone's film shoots -the score was played while the actors were making the film - in one early 1923 sequence 'Dominic' is heard and seen whistling one of the main themes from the picture (Another use of dream imagery in this film) The use of flashbacks in many of Leone's films is important to the storyline - this film is almost entirely made up of flashbacks and flash forwards. It rewards repeated viewings and never fails to amaze me with its detail and sweep and scope."
rbn_lrk-1,"Oct 24, 2013",10/10,"Next year this movie will have anniversary.Back in the 1970's and up to the 1990's the mob movies had it's heydays.Including movies like Once Upon A Time in America.If you have 4 hours go watch this.This is the story of a man that had been in a part of some New York City gangsters for decades ago.We follow them from their first crimes as kids, and up to our time where our hero finds a hidden suitcase from way back then.The movie is so long, but worth a watch anyway.But even a star filled cast in this epic could not save this movie.If you like thrills, romance and stories from a vanished era watch this.Ennio Morricone spices this movie up with his trademark music.Now go out and find this movie that are easily found in the discount stores and Blockbuster.10/10"

Shilo_R_A,"Sep 24, 2021",8/10,"This film is almost 4 hours long.I've watched it twice, the same week, in order to keep up with my IMDb top 100 poster rating. Yeah, twice the same week.So, why did I do that, you ask?Well, the first time I've watched it, I thought that the film was pretty good. The score is great, the cinematography felt decent, the story was interesting for me overall. But still, I've felt like I've missed something crucial - the ending didn't make sense at all for me, and the unorthodox structure of the film confused me. So, I've read about the film a little bit, and HELL did I miss something big. So, a rewatch it was, and I'm glad I did it.Once Upon a Time in America follows Noodles, a Jewish mafia man, throughout different eras of his life. I don't wanna spoil anything, but let's say that this film felt to me more like a character study than anything else - much like Citizen Kane - but yet, without giving up on an epic tale, full of motifs, symbolism and foreshadowing in a truly artistic way.So, tbh, I don't have any major problem with this film. The length makes it a tough film to watch without breaks, but on the second watch it went by way faster, really. The pacing is pretty good. Still, this movie may be a little exhausting at times - it truly takes its time to dive into characters, even side characters, in ways that may seem too long for the unpatient viewer. Even so, I wouldn't change it, since I do think that it adds a lot to the story.And about the things I love here - most things, I'd say. The cinematography is awesome, and the way that Leone meticulously built each and every scene is truly impressive. I love the motifs and the symbolism, and I find this film extremely intellegent (though on the surface it may appear as one that glorifies or normalizes abuse, but trust me, it ain't). As said, the score is great, very fitting, and I like how most tunes are built around the same recurring melody. The concept is also quite interesting, both on surface level and on a deep dive. Also, the acting. The acting is so damn good, and I was super impressed with the acting level of the child actors (well, one of them is Jennifer Connelly, so I should've known). Adult Moe and Deborah maybe feel a little rough acting-wise at times, but it has a good explanation imo (if you got the ending you might know what I mean.)To sum it all up - this film is so meticulously made, so smart and epic. It didn't blow my mind in any point while watching, but still, I had a good time and I'm totally impressed with the film. It truly is a work of art, despite its length. Feeling an 8.4/10 on this one."

lewsimo,"Mar 29, 2024",6/10,"Really nicely shot for then. I think they needed a director who could understand
American dialogue , which is where I net out . Even with DeNiro and his supporting cast , the dialogue falls flat.The Williamsburg sequences are not very realistic or buyable. It's slow paced and really needed a Scorsese or a Coppola to pull off these sequences. It's far from a spaghetti western and pandering at times. It's poorly cut and some of the dissolves are not well used. It could have been a half hour shorter.I'm watching it now for the fourth time or so and really have not changed my mind about it. Still worth watching."
Weathership,"Jun 23, 2003",10/10,"Leone's epic tale. Cinematography from heaven. Directed with meticulous detail. Acted with passion and reverence. BUT....see the entire film now fully restored on a 2 disc dvd. DO NOT confuse this version with the hacked up one released in the USA in 84. It was edited chronologically. This is not what Leone envisioned. See it the way the European audience did at the Festival de Canes. And they left cheering. The film is as great in its original cut as the butchered one is horrible. Make no mistake: Once Upon a Time in America is in the top fifty films of all time. See it. Take 3 hours and 45 minutes out of your life and experience the way Leone shows us details, anticipation, and sudden violence. And then try not to think about it. Unforgettable. Thank God it's been restored."
Steffi_P,"Mar 5, 2011",7/10,"The old genres of classic Hollywood were bundles of convention and cliché, familiar in their tone and romantic in their recreation of an idea. And while Hollywood itself would change massively in the modern era, those movie stylings lingered on in the memories of those who had grown up with them. Hence it was just as likely to be European filmmakers who were documenting America's history on screen, albeit through the haze of genre-tinted spectacles. Once Upon a Time in America is celebrated Italian director Sergio Leone's tribute, not to prohibition-era America, but to the classic gangster genre which once claimed to portray it.Perhaps the most striking thing about Once Upon a Time in America is its wealth of detail and compelling atmosphere. The production design is really impressive, with sets to feast the eyes on and realistically thronging street scenes. Leone and his art director Carlo Simi have struck a balance between throwing in stuff that makes sense in context and stuff that conjures up a certain feeling in the scene. A good example is when Noodles flees the opium den and makes his way to Moe's, and the streets are strewn with streamers for a forlorn, after-party appearance. Many of the 1922 scenes feature billows of smoke rising up from vents, for that dreamy, wistful look. Sound design plays an important part here, the creaking of a lift creating a tense build-up to a shooting in the way that one of Ennio Morricone's dirges might have done in a Leone Western. Morricone's music is still a key presence of course, tying various thoughts together across the decades, for example the eerie honky-tonk Yiddish theme that plays to introduce Moe's place in the opening scenes and again in the first set of 1968 scenes.The principle cast for this one are chosen from the front ranks of contemporary Hollywood talent. Robert De Niro was by this time the archetypal New York mobster, so clearly the obvious choice, even if he has to swap his trademark Italian American accent for a Bronx one. He is however a little more serene and meditative than his usual exuberant gangster acts, and the quiet dignity with which he portrays the older Noodles is especially good. James Woods provides excellent support. I love his spontaneous anger in kicking Tuesday weld out of the office after a few words from De Niro. Character actors Burt Young and Danny Aiello do the job of making a memorable impact during their brief appearances, Aiello in particular giving us some great comic relief. Tuesday weld is very good too. A handful of the other cast members are guilty of a little overacting, but I'm not in a vindictive enough mood to name names.Once Upon a Time in America may be a far cry from the surreal expanses and moustachioed bandidos of Leone's Westerns, but much of the director's visual style has survived intact. He's still just as in love with the gritty close-up as ever, bringing an unusual prominence to the mole on Robert De Niro's right cheek. For some of the actor's roles this would be covered by the make-up department, or at least the director would favour his left profile. Here however not only is De Niro's juvenile counterpart given a conspicuous mole for consistency, Leone even shows De Niro at three-quarter angles against a dark background, highlighting the mole in outline, for example when he looks at the photo of Deborah at Moe's. It's pertinent, adding an obvious flaw to those otherwise handsome features. And then of course there is Leone's painstaking slowness and protracted non-dialogue scenes, which are what make this the 230-minute behemoth that it is, since there's only really enough script here for a two-hour movie. As usual, Leone makes these unspoken moments a dance of tense mannerisms and darting eyes, which (just about) renders them watchable.But perhaps it is Once Upon a Time in America's gargantuan sprawl that is its undoing. There is nothing wrong per se with a 3hr+ movie, nor is there necessarily a problem with slow, methodical pacing. The trouble is that this picture sacrifices narrative clarity for its stylisation. I don't mean the confusing timeline-hopping; that's nothing that a repeat viewing won't sort out. However there is clearly something missing and in spite of their length some segments of the movie seem horribly truncated. There ought to be at least one more 1922 scene that brings out the comradely warmth between the boys, and between Max and Noodles in particular. It's not enough that we see it – we as an audience have to feel it. Instead we seem to be hurrying from one key incident to another with no time for character development. And in 1933 Max and Noodles seem continually at odds – there is not enough evidence that their friendship is still strong despite their disagreements, and this means the final scenes in 1968 do not have weight they ought to. Some parts of the story seem to trail off into nothing, for example the reappearance of Joe Pesci at the end of the hospital sequence. Instead the screenwriters have focused on working little bits of symbolism into the dialogue and imagery (for example, ""the key to your clock"" and ""I'll do something with your time""), but have not worked nearly as hard on the emotional continuity. As a result Once Upon a Time in America is an interesting and occasionally entertaining collection of references to gangster movie history, but it is a failure as a work of cinema."

If you are looking for a movie that has its ups and downs, highs and lows, then see ""Once Upon a Time in America""!"
MichaelJohnMartin,"Mar 2, 2003",10/10,"One of the Academy Awards great injustices,cruelly ignored round Oscar time,much in the same way that Forrest Gump stole the limelight away from the vastly superior ""The Shawshank Redemption"" at the Oscars in 1994,this tale of gangsters features one of De Niro's finest ever performances to date,and was Leone's final masterpiece,but to this day is relatively unheard of,and is overshadowed by many other gangster type films,of which in my opinion,there are very few better."
sundancekid26,"Nov 8, 2006",9/10,"Once Upon a Time in America was originally released in 1984.It starred Robert Deniro, James Woods, Joe Pesci and Jennifer Connelly. Directed by Sergio Leone, the film featured an alumnus of Leone's crew who had worked on all of his films. This included Enno Morricone's musicality as well as Carlo Simi's production design and Tonino Delli Kelli's masterful and creative cinematography. Once Upon a Time in America is a complex tale about New York City Pals who grow into gangsters and live their friendship throughout prohibition. Near the end of prohibition, a bank heist gone wrong becomes the focal point of the story. A subsequent reunion of the surviving friends 30 years later primarily involves Noodles (Deniro) revisiting his past. The movie itself is almost four hours long and its 1.85:1 ratio shows off Leone's unique visual style. For instance, at one point we may see a crane drop down from the top of the frame like some sort of giraffe to catch Noodles entering an old pub or we may watch in awe as the Brooklyn Bridge is reconstructed right before our eyes. These are just two amongst many commodities that really do reinstate this as Leone's pinnacle masterpiece. It would also be his final film. Deniro delivers the goods as usual. His method style of acting that we are so used to seems to be replaced by a more complacent and tranquil demeanor in this film. James Woods's character has a hint of ambiguity; at the end of the film I both admired and hated his character. Joe Pesci has a minimalistic role as a small-time hustler. Another mentionable fact of OUATIA would be the quality child acting portrayed throughout the film. A young Jennifer Connelly nails her role as Noodles lost childhood sweetheart in the early scenes of the picture. Throughout OUATIA we are treated to Morricone's breathtaking compositions. Perhaps it is the orchestrated version of The Beatles' 'Yesterday', or any other of his musical motifs. Not since, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' has Morricone been so luminous. Overall this film is pure cinematic art. From time to time there isn't a word said but the music and pictures on screen carry the story forward. OUATIA was released in three different edited versions - apparently the full version created a quandary for Warner Brother's executives and it was butchered down two hours. This broke Leone's heart and he would never live to see the full version be released many years later on DVD. I would recommend Once Upon a Time in America to anyone who has a deep passion for movies. It contains gratuitous use of much Leoneism and will be talked about for many decades to come. However, it does take an average of two viewings before the plot begins to make complete sense, but when it does prepare to be engulfed in Leone's most enduring creation since the sixties. A gem of a film indeed!10 out 10!"
gkimmarygleim,"Oct 14, 2021",9/10,"37 years ago ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA was released. I have read where there are apparently several different versions, so for clarity I am writing about the 3 hrs 49 m version running on Netflix this month. A CLASSIC film. Yes, the casting was impressive. Yes, funny how Deborah doesn't age. (I think her Cleopatra makeup is supposed to hide it. And I think she wipes off what is her masking of her feelings for Noodles.) The musical score is haunting beautiful. I did watch the film twice in a row. The cinematography was spectacular. Throughout the characters are seen through glass, cut glass, plain glass, mirrors; over & over they have the choice of this door or that, many hidden doors, hidden corridors. Noodles especially has these choices; keep going, go back, disappear? A beautiful example is in the hospital when after voting against Max about an upcoming opportunity, Noodles leaves by one elevator, headed Down. But in the lobby both elevator doors open, Noodles come out one and Max comes out the other. They make up, and leave arm in arm. Simple. They were split, then come back together, their friendship seemingly taking precedence over anything else. Even their initial meeting takes place with a large glass prismed light fixture. Max says help me hold it, and Noodles does.There is so much more to discuss about this marvelous film. If you haven't seen it in awhile, watch it again.Leone was a genius."

grantss,"Mar 11, 2015",6/10,"OK but not great.Interesting story, well shot with some fine performances, especially by Robert De Niro and James Woods.However, overly long and slow, to the point of tedium and boredom. Could easily have been edited down to two hours or so, from nearly four hours, without losing anything.Nothing new for director Sergio Leone, however: his westerns tend to be overly drawn-out too.Pretty lame title too. Leone was probably trying to score some points with fans of his spaghetti westerns by referencing ""Once Upon a Time in the West""."
mist,"Sep 14, 2003",10/10,"The easiest word for this film is BEST - It is the best (or one of them).It´s Sergio Leones best film; It´s one of both Robert De Niro and James Woods best films; The soundtrack is one of Ennio Morricones best (Why did it Not get an Academy Award???).The script and the photography is brilliant. The story is sad, but great.And don´t miss Jennifer Connelly, who is so cute in this film.I love it; A Masterpiece!!!"
zarthcritic,"Oct 24, 2024",N/A,"I still don't understand many of the high ratings for this movie. It's so unreal.The cast is terrible, and I don't care if De Niro is in it, because in all honesty he does a terrible job, and the character that he's playing is so despicable. It's just not worth wasting almost 4 hours of your life. I've seen it, so that you don't have to.If I could rate it -35/10, I would. That's how awful it really is. In fact, just looking at a television not turned on is infinitely better.I wouldn't even show this to my worst enemy, the devil, because I know he hates the movie himself and he only wants us to view it just so he can destroy us all.Don't ever listen to him."
SnoopyStyle,"Jul 22, 2016",8/10,"David ""Noodles"" Aaronson (Robert De Niro) is a gangster on the run after his bootlegger comrades Patrick ""Patsy"" Goldberg (James Hayden), Phillip ""Cockeye"" Stein (William Forsythe), and Max Bercovicz (James Woods) are killed. Noodles goes to the bus station but finds his money missing. He escapes out of town. Years later, he returns as an old man after being notified about his friends' burial. He recalls his childhood as a young troublemaker with his friends. His great love is Fat Moe's sister Deborah (Jennifer Connelly, Elizabeth McGovern).This epic, especially the longer versions of around four hours, is a legendary Sergio Leone gangster movie. It is memorable. De Niro is amazing. That's not a surprise. I do wish for a scene of the four friends together in the opening. The first time watching the first act can leave it a little cold and confused. Nevertheless, it's a compelling story and a worthwhile repeat watch."
rchrdshelt,"Jun 27, 2006",10/10,"I originally heard of this movie about 2 or 3 years ago and didn't really know much of what it was about or who it starred. However, about 8 months ago I stumbled upon a review of John Ulmer (an IMDb critic I generally agree with and respect) who believed it to be a forgotten gangster flick that was just as good as The Godfather and Goodfellas.After hearing such praise in his review and on IMDb I knew I had to find out more and try to see it when I could. Being a fan of Gangster films, Robert DeNiro and non-linear movies (such as Tarantino films and The Godfather Part II) I knew it must be worth seeing. Having finally got it last Christmas I had high expectations and perhaps that was the reason I was disappointed on my first viewing. I didn't have a problem with the running time. It was that it was that I found it a little too hard to understand and what messages it was trying to convey. Otherwise I thought the film was brilliantly made. However, I thought it would be unfair to judge the film after one viewing. Moreover, it seemed it was a movie that required several viewings to realise its full messages.Today, 5 months on, I gave the film its second chance and was absolutely blown away. Having seen it before, I understood more about the characters and their situations. The film is absolutely outstanding and warrants every minute of it 3 1/2 hour running time. I can understand why so much anger arose from it being butchered into a mess on its release. It is not a quick 90 minute action or comedy flick. Its much deeper than that. I'm of the opinion that its a dream of a man looking back at his past and into the future- looking at his good times, bad times, regrets and what could be coming in his life. I think the deepest message of the film is to choose the life YOU want to lead and live it to the full otherwise you may live in regret. Perhaps I'm wrong but I don't think thats the point. I think Sergio Leone has left the viewer to make up their own minds about it. I have done so. Perhaps I'll find other messages each time I watch it. Thats the sort of masterpiece this film is.On the subject of the film itself it's virtually flawless on every level. However, there's two particular things that stand out for me and I feel should be mentioned slightly above the rest - Ennio Morricone's truly outstanding score and the brilliant production design of an early 1900 New York which, in my opinion, tops that of The Godfather Part II flashbacks. I had never heard of Morricone before I saw this film but his score for it could well be THE greatest I've ever heard. As pointed out on the trivia section of IMDb it was criminally unable to be considered for an Oscar because of another mistake by the distributors. The score beautifully captures the films tone, particularly in the scenes between Noodles and Deborah. He also has several others which also work perfectly throughout the film. As far as the Production Design is concerned New York looks absolutely outstanding in the 1900's scenes and also in the 1930's ones. For the former in particular, every shot (like in Coppola's Godfather Trilogy) is beautifully designed and contains all kinds of early 20th century aspects you can think of such as smoke, horses, shop signs etc. Even in the indoor scenes, all the buildings and designs look very contemporary and every effort has gone into making you feel the film is taking place 70-100 years ago. They succeeded, and I honestly found it impossible to believe this film was shot in 1984.Other aspects of the film are tremendous as well. DeNiro (in what appears a largely forgotten role) and Woods are both outstanding in the leads along with the others such as Tuesday Weld, Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Elizabeth Mcgovern and others. However, some of the real scene-stealer's are the child actors featured in the 1900's scenes- my favourite section of the movie. Scott Tiler matches DeNiro as Noodles and a truly beautiful young Jennifer Connelly (who has deservedly gone onto bigger things and is now an Oscar winner) in my opinion upstages Elizabeth Mcgovern. The rest of the child actors all do good jobs as well.Leone's Direction and vision really shine through here with the use of Tonino Delli Colli's photography. It is particularly evident in the 1900's scenes featuring the young Deborah walkthing through crowds.Don't be put off by the 3 1/2 hour running time. This film is one of the few such as The Godfather Trilogy, The Green Mile and Titanic that warrants its running time. Both times I've watched it, it moved very fast and I was never bored. Leone always keeps you interested and I never looked at my watch or felt uncomfortable. In fact I honestly felt as though I'd been watching a 2 hour film instead of nearly 4 hour one when I watched it today.If I had any criticisms they would be of one or two distasteful scenes. I didn't have a huge problem with the disturbing rape scene as i think it was trying to tell you more about Noodles' character. However, I heavily disliked the baby switching scene, finding it incredibly distasteful and unnecessary. I know the characters aren't very likable, but that scene went too far for me.Otherwise, there's nothing else that can be criticised about this masterpiece. It is now one my all-time favourites alongside Seven and The Green Mile, and I believe as John Ulmer rightly said, ""No-one should go a lifetime without seeing this wonderfully moving film"".10/10"
MikeK-7,"Sep 26, 1999",10/10,"The running time would make most people say they don't want to see it, but don't let that stop you. Robert De Niro and James Woods give their greatest performances, and Ennio Morricone's music is fabulous. I would not recommend the 4-hour version for mainstream movie-goers. Start off with the short version (which is still about 2 and a half hours), then save a day for the long version."
amlobato-03474,"Feb 27, 2021",10/10,"If this movie was realeased in director's version, will be the most awarded movie ever, for sure. Best score (Morricone), best director, best actor in a leadind role (Woods), best movie... One of my top 3 of all time. It's a beautiful, emotional, violent, poetic story . Bravo, Mr. Leone. Thank you, Mr. Morricone."
MB_West_Lafayette,"Jun 1, 2022",6/10,"The first half is very good. The young actors are excellent and the staging is superb. The second half is so so. The shot by De Niro at Marlon Brando is obvious but it doesn't work because the end of the movie is absurd, and also because it is not original like the Godfather. Good acting is not enough. Where the Godfather was epic, this story comes short. There are also some unnecessary vulgar scenes that are there because the movie was shot in the 80s. Again, the Godfather uses vulgarity with less frequency and more art."
calebcalebwhitney,"Dec 22, 2023",1/10,"The ten minutes of a ringing phone at the beginning was probably meant to warn me that if I continued to watch I'd be in for Four hours of this pretentious dreck. So much stupidity is simply uncalled for and this film is yet another example of Leonel's ridiculous self indulgence. I made it to about the 20 minute mark but it seemed like 20 hours. I feel like I'm owed some sort of award for being able to withstand the torture. Please don't say it's because I'm prejudiced against Italian directors. Some of my best friends are Italian after all.If I had watched a couple minutes more I would have had to kick the television off its stand, and my mom doesn't deserve that. Watch this movie if you will, but you'll rue the day."
fciocca,"Sep 26, 2021",9/10,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a really rare movie. It was a passion project directed by Sergio Leone and I could see that he put a lot of love into it. It is a different take on the whole mob genre, as it focuses more on the characters' personal lifes, what they feel, their weaknesses and their friendships. There is also a good dose of violence, but it is definitely used as background. In short, do not expect a movie such as ""The Godfather"" or ""Goodfellas"".I have watched the extended director's cut that lasts over four hours, with additional restored scenes, that honestly does not add much to the extended European version. The movie is undoubtedly long, but you need also to understand that it portrays the origin and the evolution of a Jewish criminal gang, since they are teenagers, until basically their latest years, and it does this by really deepening every single aspect, without ever being boring or repetitive. Obviously the film is really slow paced, there are some scenes where the director focuses on a look, or on some details, that are functional to the story. Everything feels just right placed. The narration is non-linear, and we jump constantly between past and present, adding dynamicity to the whole plot.From a technical point of view, the film is perfect. The photography is stunning and there are many iconic shots that inspired countless of other filmmakers, photographers and artists. The Brooklyn Bridge shot is probably the most notorious one. The lighting and the color correction are wonderful. The director managed to give a realistic depiction of the 20s, 30s, and the 60s. Three different eras, with three completely different settings, societies and values. The film portrays these changes really well. With a cast composed by Robert De Niro, James Woods and Tuesday Weld, you cannot really get wrong. Very disappointed by McGovern. She was the only one that I could not really stand. I don't know if she got better over time, but personally I think that here she is awful, as she could not carry any kind of emotion. The score composed by the maestro Ennio Morricone is simply unforgettable and will live forever. It really immersed me in the story and it was always placed in the right moments. Tracks are so diverse, there is one in particular that is heavily inspired by Spaghetti Western, a brave choice that works.This Movie left a legacy that only very few films can claim. I would stay hours to write about the amazing scenery and the well crafted screenplay, but I believe that enough has been said. If you love cinema, or you aspire to work in the film or video industry you must watch this absolute masterpiece."
sokrtsan,"Feb 6, 2021",10/10,A level Music. Amazing acting. Brilliant Photography. Top level direction. Godlike Plot. Godlike character development. Creates a psychological loop once you realize the script structure. Breaks the cliché of the gangster genre. More tragedy than drama.
thetyvonlesure,"Aug 16, 2019",8/10,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America (3 hour and 49 minute version) is a beautifully paced art piece. The film jumps between time periods, masterfully blending three different zeitgeists. The detail placed in this film is brilliant. The story takes its' time to get where it needed to be. While the film is long, it feels as if there's more than one movie within this film. Leone makes the film feel like a trilogy or bilogy of sorts, when he tells different stories from multiple eras. The set/environments of the film are very stylish. The set and environment expand and become more vibrant with the story overtime. Leone successfully transitions us from a period of immigrants in New York in the early 1900s, to the prohibition era, to a more modern period. The film tells a different story of America for a specific group. As these characters grow, so does the country and its' conflict. The characters within this film are very relatable, in the sense that their lives represent our elevation or descent into our later years. Despite their deplorable actions, the characters are all charismatic and engaging. The dialogue between characters is natural. The acting in this film is great. The younger cast and their older counterparts transition these characters in a cohesive manner. It's as if you're actually watching the younger cast grow into their older selves. Robert De Niro and James Woods do a fantastic job in their roles. Their acting is phenomenal. The cinematography is great, with shots that feel as if they were ripped from a Picasso painting or a Michelangelo sculpture. The shots in this film are masterful, with few exceptions. The storytelling keeps you engaged for the most part. The only exception is after the intermission. After the intermission, the film feels a little boring and fruitless at times. It could have been done in a manner of ease, however it feels crammed in with the rest of the film. The film is very long (depending on what version you watch). However, it's a great film. Overall, Once Upon a Time in America is a classic mob movie that encompasses an artistic vision with timeless storytelling."
supertom-3,"Mar 18, 2005",10/10,"Sergio Leone's final master-piece and a swan-song to outdo all swan-songs. Once Upon A Time is a purely magical film, as good as Sergio's other Once Upon A Time film, set in the West. A great debate rages as to which film of Sergio's is his best and that is a question I can't answer having not seen all his pieces. There is no doubt he has done several classic films, with his best Westerns and this gangster epic. What makes Sergio's films so magnificent is their timelessness. Leone's visual eye is astounding and while watching some old films can sometimes feel stale, past it. Leone is a director whose use of the camera was revolutionary, dynamic and iconic. Leone is perhaps one of the most inspirational and mimicked directors ever.This is a movie of pure cinematic beauty. It is wonderfully shot and the lighting is fantastic. The sense of timing Leone's films have is amazing with each scene and captured performance magnificent. America is a marvellous movie to behold and never drags, even at near 4 hours. The narrative is told in a Tarantino-esque (I don't like referencing Quentin and make him sound like the inventor of a non-linear plot but he is the most famous user) with the action switching from the end of the 60's when it is set, right back to the 20's. The story is a recounting of the life story of Noodles, growing up from a young street hood, to a big time gangster to a kind of tragically lonely old man. The film focuses on his development through a 50 year period of his life about his friendships, loves, and guilt and betrayal. Noodles is magnificently portrayed by Robert De Niro in a role that a lot regard as one of his all time greats. Like every other aspect of the film, De Niro was tragically ignored by the Academy that year, and the film didn't receive one nomination. That's Oscar politics for you though, the film flopped and was as such ignored. The film shows the absolute pinnacle of perfection in acting (on several fronts, but particularly De Niro and James Woods), directing, cinematography, writing and perhaps most memorably the career best score of Ennio Morricone, Leone's long time collaborator.So the story is great as are the technical and artistic merits of the film, but what of the supporting cast? Well as I said De Niro is outstanding, with James Wood's coming a very close second. Other noteworthy performances arrive from Elizabeth McGovern, Tuesday Weld, Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, Burt Young and many more. What works so brilliantly in this piece is the amount of memorable side characters portrayed by ""name"" actors. Brief cameos delivered with memorable class, for example Joe Pesci and Treat Williams who come and go quickly leaving an indelible mark in the film. Special note also goes to the young cast playing the main roles in the early years sections. They are faultless and excellent. Younger actors can often lack polish and maturity in their performances. There aren't a whole load of Dakota Fannings and Haley Joel Osments rolling off a production line. Finding a young actor who can move up from giving an acceptable performance to having the ability to captivate is quite rare, and so for Leone to have found a lot of brilliant young actors who look remarkably like their adult actors playing the older versions of the characters is truly amazing. While most of these young actors didn't go on to bigger and greater fame, one did: Jennifer Connelly. She plays the young Deborah before Elizabeth McGovern (who is the spitting image of the young Connelly). Jennifer Connelly has of course developed into an Oscar winning and excellent actress and in her screen debut here she shows those early signs of excellence at a very youthful 12 yrs of age. Her performance is excellent, and in an integral and key scene that many actors of her age, and indeed older would have buckled under, she is superb. The scene has her giving a recital to the young Noodles (Who is in love with her). The performance is given with such maturity and with such a sense of timing and delivery that it is truly amazing. It was one of the best performances from a young star to ever grace the big screen in my opinion. She was a superb young actress, who developed into a superb actress and her performance here shows genuine talent and of course kudos to Leone for harnessing that ability and extracting it correctly.As I said Morricone's score is marvellous and of the best scores ever. The music of the film has also appeared in the Kill Bill movies as well. Morricone a composer of such a prolific CV manages to deliver a career best score at a stage in his career when he had been around for years. However he found and continues to find, the inspiration not to let his work become stagnant like some composers. Overall this is a film that is regarded as a classic, mentioned in the same breath as the Godfather films and Goodfellas. It is epic, beautiful and in all counts, masterful. *****"

My initial impression of the incoherent, choppy and messy delivery was quickly put to rest once I realised the inner intelligence of Sergio Leone. This is his masterwork and I'm glad I watched it.Classic stuff. Francis Ford Coppola could never pull this through as brilliantly as Leone.I'm taking 'Childhood Memories' from Morricone's soundtrack to my grave."
Mulder-58,"Sep 16, 1999",N/A,"This is probably one of the greatest and most underrated gangster movies of all time.  Although the movie is non-linear, it still manages to flow really well.  It is a really great story about a group of guys that grew up together and got involved in organized crime.  The performances by each actor are superb, and the directors cut ending is incredible.  Don't watch the movie if your not watching the director's cut though."
Leofwine_draca,"Sep 22, 2016",7/10,"A human drama masquerading as a gangster story, this, the last and perhaps most epic film of Sergio Leone's career, is a story that takes three and a half hours to play out. During the running time we are subjected to a lengthy, complex, and utterly compelling drama that charts the rise and fall of love, friendship, and betrayal in the life of Noodles, a Jewish gangster as played by Robert De Niro. Only true fans of the cinematic experience need apply, who have the patience to sit through many slow scenes and watch the story play out on its own without any rush or contrivances. Once you realise that every moment that plays out on screen is important in the life of the central protagonist you'll realise what a good film this; there is no excess baggage, no extraneous characters, just realism and heartfelt drama. The whole gangster aspect of the story and the setting is just a backdrop for emotions and relationships to play out. Despite the lack of action (fans of Leone's westerns will find the shoot-outs and fights in short supply here) there are many shocking moments in the movie, many involving sexual violence of one kind or another which is tough to watch but still compelling.It goes without saying that the cast is wonderful, and packed with the usual suspects doing their thing. De Niro excels and has the best old-age makeup I've ever seen, James Woods is on the edge as usual, and Elizabeth McGovern is Deborah, an intense object of desire for De Niro. Did anyone ever think that the reason she hasn't aged at all at the end of the film is because we're seeing reality through De Niro's eyes, and in his eyes she is still as young and beautiful as she ever was? Anyway, plenty of familiar faces pack out the rest of the cast, from Treat Williams, Joe Pesci, and Burt Young to Danny Aiello as the hilarious police chief. William Forsythe, Darlanne Fluegel, the list is endless and also includes Jennifer Connelly in her first acting performance.Leone's cinematography is as great as ever and he has a lot of fun crafting some classic moments. The never-ending ringing telephone is a great element to the story and I never realised I could be captivated by the sight of a man stirring a cup of coffee. But there you go. It wouldn't be half the film it without Ennio Morricone's typically evocative score which in many ways surpasses that of ONCE UPON A TIME IN THE WEST with its character themes and solemn, tragic, yet beautiful music. Many elements run throughout the story, many involving the flawed character of De Niro, and without rushing the story gradually evolves in jigsaw-like segments with fall together for the nostalgic conclusion. This is a film that demands close attention throughout to capture all the little nuances and unfolds into a sometimes amazing film as a whole."
Andreas Jung,"Dec 22, 2001",10/10,"I saw this film about five times now. And it is always a great pleasure. I recommend it every time and nearly everywhere, because that movie is outstanding. I know, it is not easy to follow the plot, because there are a lot of timeline´s to come clear with, but it is worth it. I like movies in which there are a lot of ideas (story and screenplay) guiding you to a final climax at the end of it all. In OUATIA you are told the story´s of a bunch of kids, becoming the mob. It is entertaining the whole time (yes, a little bit slow sometimes,okay) and it leads to the point where it´s obvious that all the lives are just wasted. No friendship and no love does exist in the life of these guys. The way that the movie tells you that, makes me love it. Yes, Noodles is only a character, and the character is a killer, smuggler and whatever, but beholding the wasted life of this man really makes sad! The film creates emotions, and that´s what movies and music are made for in my opinion. If you´d ask me - I would watch it! (Please excuse my bad knowledge of the english language)"
isantistao,"Jan 30, 2020",6/10,"This movie is good...could be great...but it is just way too long and it is also too disturbing. It is 4 hours long, which would be find if that time wasn't filled with excessive gazing and staring off into space, and scenes where it just felt like the movie was taking a long pause. So much of it really needed to be edited out, the film really should be half as long.And whats more, is that there are 2 rape scenes in the movie. And done by the main character, not a villain, but someone who you are otherwise supposed to be empathizing with. One of these scenes is very disturbing as well. I really think that the film could do without all of that. So if you are going to watch this do so at your own risk."

dlmkennedy,"Jun 24, 2007",10/10,"Just an all-around fantastic piece of artwork! The acting was superb. The cinematography was outstanding. The direction was unbelievable. The non-linear storyline is second to none. Though on the surface, it appears to be another gangster movie, I see it more as a love story. Leone did a superb job of portraying the relationships of Max and Noodles, and Debra and Noodles. James Woods' performance was stellar, and Robert De Niro as always, is on top of his game. The Godfather is definitely the best of the genre. I would rank Once Upon A Time in America as the best gangster movie of all-time had the supporting cast been more visible. Though the supporting cast performances were right on, having some established Hollywood ""names"" might have helped. The Godfather offered a supporting cast that had more household names that the audience could ""connect"" with. That being said, Once Upon A Time in America is a true classic, in every sense of the word! Great start, great middle, and super ending! Absolutely the shortest 4 hour movie experience that I have ever had!"
thatcherman-25698,"Nov 18, 2018",10/10,"Don't believe the 1s and 7s, they clearly just came back from watching Star Wars recently, anyway this is Sergio Leone's true masterpiece to the world. The story is more epic and sadder than GoodFellas, and Godfather. Robert Di Nero gives his greatest performance in his entire career, right next to James Woods and everyone else. Set in the prohibition era ""Max"" (aka Robert) grows up as a street punk and later as a man, grows up to be a murdering gangster and the story turns into something much more greater than any story in history. Watch it with your father/uncle some of the content maybe too much for the ladies to handle. 10/10 should've won an academy award."
Dan C.,"Sep 24, 1999",10/10,"I rented this movie back in 1985 and thought it was one of the best crime dramas I had ever seen. The story was great and so was the acting. But what I liked the most was the way it was directed. Long stares, the way scenes jumped from past to present, and the way it all ties together at the end. I like the way that it makes you think about some of the things that happened without just making it obvious. There are some different versions of this film, one which was originally shown to american audiences was a 2 hour mess, a horrible film that made absolutely no sense. Then there is the almost 4 hour movie that Leone originally wanted and is a masterpiece, See this one it is a great film. Also the movie has a great cast, DeNiro,James Woods, Burt Young, Joe Pesci, James Russo, Danny Aiello, and also those kids."
bwiseman50,"Sep 18, 2021",9/10,Slow moving but can be appreciated after several viewings.
daralad,"Apr 2, 2022",N/A,"I watched this recently and it is long and slow. The attitude to women is neanderthal, the music is scmaltzy and over sentimental and James Woods seems to be a dreadful actor.It probably doesn't help that this movie will inevitably be compared to once upon a time in the west and the good the bad and the ugly, two of the best films ever made, but if feels like this was from a different director. It tries to be sentimental but the times it flashes back to are elaborate boring pieces unlike the clips from his other films that imply better times rather than painstakingly depicting them. Let's be honest the section with the kids is too long and too bugsy malonish. Disappointing."
theshanecarr,"Feb 7, 2021",7/10,"I have mixed feelings about Once Upon a Time in America. I love Sergio Leone's work. The Dollars trilogy is endlessly enjoyable, and Once Upon a Time in the West is one of my favourite movies of all time. So I pressed play believing I was about to see a movie that would wrap itself around my heart, and which I would be thinking about for years to come. I guess I can't say yet if I'll be thinking about it for years to come, but I can say it didn't wrap itself around my heart the way I hoped it would.Leone does not lack for ambition. One area he has not skimped on is the length. At almost four hours, I assumed I would need to break my viewing up, but such was my fascination, I watched it straight through, and felt I would have liked more. (There is apparently a six hour version which I think would be a positive thing. The two hour twenty cut released by the studio in 1984 must have been a butchering indeed.)With such scope for story, I had expected the brassy, bold myth making about the founding of America shown in Once Upon a Time in the West would be replicated here, but transplanted to a toned-down, Godfather-influenced gangster milieu. Detailing the survival of an immigrant community amidst the changing skyline of New York seemed like epic material, but the story is much more interior than that.It may be wrong to judge a film for what it was not rather than what it is, but I was expecting something Leone wasn't interested in giving. This does indeed have the striking visuals I expect from his work. Not just the eye-catching beautiful shots such as the one used for the poster, but recreations of 1920's New York streets, and those near-trademark Leone close-ups of faces. There are sweet, smaller moments too like a character admiring themselves in a mirror, or a girl dancing amidst detritus. Beautiful and evocative.He is helped by a marvellous, and instantly recognisable, score from Ennio Morricone. As the notes swell, and young men skip beneath the shadows of immense structures, it is impossible not to marvel at the combination of sight and sound, and at what Leone has achieved.Yes, Leone plays those big notes beautifully but subtlety, psychological realism, forensic examination are not Leone's register, and the film suffers. The screenplay is working against the visuals all along. That's not entirely surprising as it's credited to 6 writers (including Leone), plus a seventh ""additional dialogue"" credit. That did not bode well.Our point-of-view character is Robert DeNiro as David ""Noodles"" Aronson. The film is mostly structured as a series of extended flashbacks told from the point of view of an older Noodles in 1965, returning to New York, and remembering his life there; the hard scrabble start, the enduring bonds of loyalty between his friends, their rise in the underworld during prohibition, the woman he loved, and his flight from New York.The tone is one of elegy and lament; for lost friends, for a simpler time, for mistakes made and paths not taken, but the film never engages with the adult Noodles as a person. The script does better with the young 1920s Noodles (played by Scott Tiler), who we are able to see as a charismatic leader among his peers. Once Noodles ages, and DeNiro takes over, much of what is happening is driven by others (Mostly James Woods in great form as the unscrupulous Max), while DeNiro is left to look on inscrutably.DeNiro often plays characters who don't give away much but the screenplay almost loses interest in him after 1920 except as a witness to ongoing criminal enterprises.
Even in his personal life, Noodles is stuck in the patterns established early in the movie. His love for Deborah (played by Elizabeth McGovern as an adult, and the radiant Jennifer Connelly as an adolescent) is set in stone. Why he feels anything for her years later, why she should like him at all are never explored. When we meet Noodles, he is already entranced by the princess-like Deborah which we can understand given the glimpse she gives him of something beyond the grime and grind of his life - but she remains a cypher, and his lover for her just an unalterable fact.This brings us to the outrageous sexual politics of the movie. Twice we watch Noodles rape a woman. At least the second time, the film recognises it for the horrific violation it is. The first time, it is suggested the victim was more or less complicit, and encouraged/enjoyed it. Tuesday Weld as Carol is a welcome spark in the film but that scene's ugliness and the use of rape as a plot point is a mis-step the film can't overcome.There are other tonal inconsistencies which hurt the more somber side of things. (A scene where the men whip out their penises to see if Carol can recognise which man raped her toy fondling them particularly stands.) Some of the dialogue is painfully on the nose, and the gangs rise is depicted as ridiculously easy. The four boys come up with ingenious inventions, conveniently come by blackmail material, and can take out any opposition they come across while bullets (mostly) glance off them. All of that contrivance pales compared to some final act plot revelations which stretch credulity way past breaking point. There are holes wide enough to drive several hearses through.These final scenes of a man reckoning with his past are intended to provoke an awestruck recognition of a man realising who he is, but instead produce eye rolls.
I love how this films looks, and its ambition in depicting a slice of New York through the decades but the film only ever skims along the surface of these people's lives, leaving beautiful ripples but a sense we missed the deeper currents beneath."
dave_wlogan,"Feb 3, 2009",10/10,"This is a movie that I had heard about and was told that it was something special. To be honest I was a little skeptical. I've seen to many Robert De Niro films and can almost predict how hes gonna handle the role after seeing a few minutes of him in character. Im never exactly right but I'm usually pretty close. Ask my stepdad. But he did this in a way that I didn't expect. This performance is Immortal. And I don;t want to ruin it for anyone so I'll say no more on it.Now the film itself is a film that could be great with the worst cast. But because each cast member gives a sublime performance, the film is all the better for it. I was especially impressed with James Hayden who I thought was the best actor during the ruthless scenes but you never thought he was overly ruthless as a character out of those scenes.The film is like a long visual poem. Each segment is beautiful, sometimes haunting and seamless. The lighting captures the emotion perfectly, sometime appearing contradictory to the mood but that bolsters the audience's unease. Overall the camera-work is stunning.Forget every great script you've read or heard in film. This one is terse, occasionally taciturn and highly entertaining. Words cannot describe something full of them.This is a masterpiece. No Godfather comparisons please. Different types of gangster films which are incomparable."
david__T,"Apr 14, 2008",6/10,"Whilst this film does have a fairly interesting story to tell (although not as interesting as Goodfellas) there are far too many things wrong here for the film to be hailed as a masterpiece as some people are doing...First there is the length. At 4 hours long, this takes patience beyond tolerable levels. Whilst films like Dances With Wolves & 2001: A Space Odyssey consistently give the viewer many great things to look at & listen to even when the story isn't moving, this film is far too pedestrian with none of that polish. Obviously the Director has used the run time to fully indulge himself - and some shots do work quite well - but we don't get anything approaching the beautiful docking scene in 2001 to justify the long run time. Obviously the studio tried to hack the film down to 139 minutes (which was even less successful), but a more sequential film would have been shorter - which leads nicely on to...The jumps through time. These didn't add to the experience much for me - and judging by many reviews, just served to confuse a lot of people; just watch Pulp Fiction to see how this should be done. Also this unnecessarily complicated the plot...If even the people giving this film good reviews are saying that it needs to be watched 2 or 3 times to fully understand what is going on, then how can that be a good thing? Films like the Sixth Sense which take on a new light when watched again (after you find out certain key points) are far different from films that you have to watch twice just to understand them. This film could be 2 points higher as a result of better editing & a tighter grip on the story. I for one sometimes get annoyed when I listen to directors saying that they chopped things out for pacing or purely just to reduce the run time - especially in films like Terminator 2 or Leon which are better in their Directors Cut guise. However this film could have benefited from that process.Overall, the acting was good, as was the casting - the younger versions of the main characters even looked similar to their older counterparts. The Direction, Cinematography and Music have their merits (these saved me from rating the film an average 5/10) and there is much to enjoy in spells, but as a whole, I think the film lacks enough visual punch & originality to outdo the Godfather et al. Gangster movie? Yes, but this is no Goodfellas."
rcolayco,"Jul 22, 2005",10/10,"I first saw ""Once Upon a Time in America"" quite by accident, twenty years ago. I was visiting the US to attend business meetings. Late one night, after a long, long day, I returned to my hotel room and turned on the TV while I got ready for bed. There was this movie that seemed to have just begun. I sat on the bed for (what I thought would be) a moment to decide whether to keep it on. I started to take off my tie and shoes as I did. . . Nearly three hours later, I realized I had not got beyond that. I had become totally captivated by the violent tale that unfolded on the screen. I've never quite figured out what chord this movie struck within me. Perhaps the terrible waste and regret that arises from the virtually mindless, unbridled pursuit by Noodles and his gang, of their extraordinary appetite for pleasure and wealth? Why I would resonate so strongly with that, I have not tried to fathom."
SILKMAN342000,"Feb 14, 2005",10/10,"i have seen the movie over and over and i have come the following conclusion. This movie was a lock to be a great one. I don't try to analyze every scene, every line spoken, why do that. To me the test of a good movie is are the characters believable? If you can answer yes then you can view the movie with real eyes and not critic eyes. Look at the characters in the movie who gave the movie weight such as Sally the girl whore who grow up to be a woman whore. Fat Moe a slob as a child and a slob as adult, these are real people we see every day and most of us know of these people. See the movie and look carefully and you will be surprised at what you will see and like."
Aapox3,"Jul 5, 2006",10/10,"This is honestly one of the best movies of all time. Although it's quite lengthy, it is continually entertaining, thrilling, and even a little confusing. The scenery of the film is magnificent, as is the way the story is told. Robert DeNiro, as always, is fantastic, but James Woods plays an amazing role that has gained my certain respect. I wished Joe Pesci would have been worked into a bigger role because he is outstanding and hilarious in mob movies, but his minimal screen time and rather insignificant character role can be explained. He would doubtfully fit as any of the main 4, and beyond that are only a couple other key characters and he wouldn't work as any. Overlooking his small role, the overall quality of this film has me thinking it may be second to only GoodFellas in true mob/gangster epics."
TinoXmr,"Oct 29, 2018",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America takes time. To view and to understand.
So many are giving low ratings because it is too slow and complicated. Personally I never found myself bored in 4 hours of runtime and I really appreciate a film that leaves some elements to personal inerpretations. I loved the setting, the photography, the cast and how this epic story unwinds beautifully reaching all aspects of life: friendship, love, betrayal, business, greed,....
It is not easy, so take your time and watch carefully. If you are a casual film watcher who can't stand more than 120 minutes long works, just leave it. It requires some effort.
But It's worth it. Watch it."
theonereviewer-55820,"Feb 5, 2023",N/A,"This review is about the director's cut that I've seen on the Internet and on DVD.First of all, I had a review here the last time, but it was removed. There are still some people who are trying to make me see this absolute junk! I think that the whole movie is just cringy, disturbing, disgusting, violent and/or boring. The book may be better. But after seeing this, I'm not going to bother reading it. The book doesn't seem promising enough to me.If I want to review something, then I think that I'm entitled to my own opinion. I'm not going to praise junk just because some De Niro-fanatics want me to. I'm going to review it as it is.Why waste almost four hours, when there is other more productive things that you can do with your time?If you haven't seen this and you seriously care about your life, then skip this movie entirely. It's extremely overrated! The negative reviews are the most honest ones here on IMDb.Note: It's the first R-rated movie I'm giving this low, and it's because it deserves it! It's the worst movie I've seen in a long time, and I will not back down until people get it! Even if I have to write this review again, I will do it.And I'm not being rude either, this ""movie"" is absolutely awful!My rating: 0/10."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Jun 5, 2020",6/10,"Leone's last film is also his longest, at least in its widely accepted 'complete' version, and it represents his most drastic shift in terms of tone, time-period and, in some ways, theme. 'Once Upon A Time In America (1984)' isn't a western, nor even a proto neo-western, and it shares much more in common with 'serious' 70s movies such as 'The Godfather (1972)' than with its own, often partially light-hearted predecessors. Still, that isn't an inherently bad thing. Neither is the picture's length, which is primarily a product of Leone's desire to take his time with each and every shot while also covering around fifty years of the protagonist's life. Though it does feel a bit baggy and, at times, aimless, taking a pair of scissors to it wouldn't solve anything (as evidenced by the reception of the apparently nonsensical two-hour cut originally shown in the US). For a film that's nearly four hours, it remains surprisingly engaging. It isn't energetic, by any means, but it's always interesting and feels like it knows what it's doing. The movie's most entertaining moments actually come from, essentially, an extended flashback (though, its general time-hopping structure doesn't have a definitive jumping-off point). This part depicts its characters as young teenagers, portraying their initial descent into crime as one of circumstance and naïveté. It's an engaging segment that carries with it a sort of coming of age, and it does a lot of the legwork for the rest of the picture. Once the characters become adults, they're a lot more callous and, as a result, a lot less empathetic. We're aligned with the lead as he's reintroduced to his old friends and is inducted into their new line of work, but he soon slips away from us to become a pretty unlikeable guy. I mean, his instantaneous willingness to rape is enough to prevent any real attachment between audience and character. However, he's still an interesting persona and his journey is one worth watching, especially as it moves into his later years. By the time the ending rolls around, you might have become somewhat numb to the storytelling. It's for this reason that the final act doesn't quite work as well as it, by all rights, should. Don't get me wrong, the ending is good and the moments leading up to it are arguably the flick's most intriguing. It's just that much of the movie - in the second act, especially - kind of stays at one level of intensity, which creates a sort of monotone state that can't be broken simply by a slightly more entertaining sequence. This is perhaps the picture's biggest problem; it simply isn't all that gripping. However, it's enjoyable enough for its majority and it deals with some interesting, if underplayed, themes. Plus, Moriccone's melancholy musical score doesn't disappoint. Ultimately, it's perhaps Leone's weakest major effort, but it's still a good film. If you don't mind its length, it's worth watching once. 6/10"
charlesbrian-03440,"Nov 4, 2018",10/10,"It's a film that is an epic gangster and friendship story all in one. Sergio interweaves timelines with the finesse of a master and all the acting is superb.The film starts in earnest with the cast as children. The friendship built up at the start makes the developments throughout the film that come all the more heartbreaking. It also shows both a real and gritty side to New York and the adolescents themselves. These are children from effectively the ghetto and it doesn't hold back on showing that.What's also brilliantly done is the rivalry between the two leads Deniro and Woods, but also the great friendship and love each of them has for each other.This film though is also a gangster film and what's so well done here is it shows the whole spectrum of a gangster's life. So you see the consequences of their choices which you rarely see in one film.Then there's the actors themselves. This us one of Deniro's best films as noodles is a very flawed and human character. He is both a monster and relatable in the same breath.James Woods is also exceptional. He is the best friend and protagonist all in the same breath. Theirs very much a sibling vibe to his and Deniro's relationship.Then there's McGovern who is the escape for and potential downfall of Deniro's character all at once.The child versions of all these characters are also brilliant especially the young Jennifer Connelly.The final main character is the music. It sets the scene so well and conveys some of heartbreak and the joy just as well as the actors.Overall the film is epic in every way and deserves any plaudits it gets. One of the greatest films of all time."

MJB784,"May 29, 2018",9/10,"It's a great mobster movie. It's about the life of this gangster through his childhood and adulthood including him imagining his future through a dream state of inhaling opium. I have a feeling that all the scenes taken place before his opium smoking intro were real and he was hallucinating the scenes when he has grey hair. For one explanation, the phone kept ringing as a sign that something is off. He's slowly heading into the dream world from the opium. The story is told through memory and dreams and how the two begin and end similarly. For every time a scene ends, a similar image begins. It's 3 hours and 49 minutes, but doesn't feel long. I usually find Leone boring because a lot of scenes go on too long where we wait until someone says or does something. Once Upon a Time in America is smoother and better paced and the story pulls you in more."
Loo-2,"May 11, 2003",N/A,"Sergio Leone and Marconi have brought us some of the most beautiful scenes of cinematic beauty in their Italian made Western's.  They showed a more real version of the wild west then American directors dared to show.  The West was wild and lawless. We felt that all had no choice but to work outside of law as it did not exist.  America, from the 20s to the 60s and 70s, is a modern world of Democracy and Law.  Those who chose to be gangsters, did so out of their own choice.  Especially the Jewish ones, as they could all have gone to school and become successful in a totally acceptable manner.   This is the main difference between the world of ""Once Upon a Time in the West"", and the world of ""Once Upon a Time in America"". Two different worlds and two completely different films.  Both mesmerizing.   We see the world and life of two Jewish Gangsters (Deniro and Woods) being Noodles and Max.  We see them from school children, to old men.  All parts important and shown in various forms of flashbacks.  All the flashbacks edited with music and scenery as to blend together in a dream.  The Actors who play the children, look like child versions of Deniro and woods.  The attention to details is wonderful.   The music is part of the characters and part of their lives.  At one point one of the charactors plays the main movie theme on a wind pipe.  We are watching a poetic fairy tale of gangsters in love.  They are in love with their image, themselves and their friends and sweethearts.  The movie is about temptation.  In one of the childhood scenes, a 12 year old boy is waiting to have a sexual experience with the local girl tramp.  Her price is an ice cream Sunday.  He has to wait until she finishes with someone else.  While he is waiting, the ice cream starts to melt and the camera pans the boys face.  He licks the melted cream and watches it.  After a little while he has forgotten the girl and finishes the ice cream.  He is just a boy after all.  His real temptation the ice cream and the sex just a result of peer pressure.   The scene is without dialogue and is beautiful.This is a Leone film and our hero is still thoughtful and silent.  Here he is played by Deniro and we are in awe as to how a great actor can convey the silent hero with expressions and emotional force.  Deniro is superb.The constant flashbacks in this film should make it hard to follow the story line, but instead sucks us into the characters, their motives and their life.  It sucks us in and we are captivated.  This captivation this interest allows us to follow the story with ease.  This is brilliance of the movie.Leone has made a different film then he has made before and he has kept his style and reinvented the Hollywood version of the Gangster film.  There is no glamour in our thugs.  Even Deniro does not know how to make love to a woman.  After all he was in prison for many years.  He is a thug.   This is not ""The Godfather"".   It is real and stunning.The ending is perfect as it makes you think.   A smile give out the last fact in the story that is missing, but it lets you figure this out for yourself.     Remember the smile.   Remember Deniro in his greatest role. Remember Leone.Great film.  A must see for all who love what is good in the movies."
Horror_Flick_Fanatic,"Mar 10, 2021",6/10,"It's a fine film, but it is quite long. At least the restored version with the deleted scenes I watch felt that way at 4 hours and 11 minutes long. I found the second half more interesting than the first. On YouTube, some tubers referred to this film as a Masterpiece of Cinema. I honestly haven't seen it that way but I am not hear to contradict the gatekeepers. Only to share my opinion."
nfedean,"Feb 15, 2020",10/10,"This is a masterpiece of cinema it has its flaws don't get me wrong don't even go near the much maligned cinema cut ,the 3 hour plus cut is the closes to Sergio's orginal vision.Anybody giving this film under 8 simply doesn't understand cinema and to start attacking the sexual content and violence in this film is just the sad state of affairs with live in today , films are not moral compasses somebody even criticised the fact that it's about Jewish gangsters as laughable just shows you the level of knowledge and brain cell count of some of the people who have marked this film down. From moricone's epic score probably his best work to the lush New York framing ,Brooklyn bridge shot is one of my all time favourites of cinema a must see for any true fan of cinema"
dexter-vane,"May 17, 2015",7/10,"I'm a great fan of Leone's work, and this is probably my favourite movies of his. It is a very modern Sergio Leone, without losing his style.It might be long, but worth every minute without ever dragging. There are hardly any movies that handle non-linear story telling better than this one. The beautiful cinematography and always fitting music emerges you in almost every decade of the first half of the 20th century. The great story is brought to life with a great cast, especially with an alway great Robert DeNiro. It has every aspect of a good Gangster movie. So take an evening and watch this movie. A must see for any movie fan."
JuguAbraham,"Feb 21, 2006",9/10,"Not many realize that Sergio Leone was offered the chance to direct Puzo's ""The Godfather"" but opted to make ""Once upon a time in America."" They say he regretted this decision later in life--but it would be pertinent why someone like Leone would have made such a decision.Any Leone fan would know the importance the director gives to music, structure of the story, the importance of money and how it corrupts many values. All these elements are underlined in this gangster film. In Coppola's work, the story afforded more importance to social details, character details and fabulous camera-work. Both works are monumental--but I preferred Leone's work, truncated to less than 4 hours than his original cut of 6 hours.The music. Leone's favorite Ennio Morricone provided one of the finest film music for this film and he won awards for this film as he had won praise for Leone's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" and a host of other spaghetti westerns by Leone. But the real contributor of music was a Romanian flute player called Georghe Zamfir who plays the brilliant ""Pan's song"" just as Zamfir played the same tune equally effectively in Australian Peter Weir's ""Picnic at Hanging Rock"" made 9 years before Leone's film. Weir and Leone both know their music and both need to be complimented for picking up this obscure Romanian to enhance their films. Leone's cinema does not limit to brilliance of music--he uses sound to give effects that surpass the camera eye. The ringing telephone--a telephone ring that persists before the number dial moves on the instrument--provided a stamp of Leone that no viewer will easily forget--and no director had accomplished so effectively. Of course, the telephone call was so central to the film's plot. If the telephone was not enough, the sound of the lift moving up (without a passenger) plays another aural reminder of Leone's cleverness behind the camera.The structure. Leone's screenplay of switching from the present to the past and vice versa increases the entertainment value. Coppola's work was linear and less demanding of the viewer. In many ways Leone's work comes very close to the Coppola's third ""Godfather"" film--his least appreciated Godfather film, which mixes pathos, irony and closure to intrigues. Leone's film is many ways quite philosophical as was Coppola's ""Godfather III""--far removed from the brutal and power-hungry Godfathers I and II. Leone was able to add a dash of comedy--scenes with antics of the Artful Dodger in Carol Reed's ""Oliver!"" are copied in the sequences of the early years. Leone's comedy can span from a simple act of hungry boy eating a cream pastry that he had bought to impress his love interest to a young girl taunting her boy lover that ""his mother is calling"" when his male friend whistles. Coppola's cinema rarely dealt with comedy, unless it was a precursor to tragedy. Several sequences where Leone switches time--the eyes of the protagonist changing from the old to the young man, the appearance of the protagonist in the railway station, and the Frisbee hitting the protagonist as he walks the lonely cold street--makes the film more exciting and colorful. The long film is suddenly less boring as it entertains you while unfolding the saga. The switching of the female child with the male, the corruption among the law enforcers, and the obvious dwarfing of the female characters against the male parts for Leone appears more pronounced than in Coppola, because the intent is to underline the weakness of male folly at the height of their power.The film is Leone's essay on American's interest in getting rich and powerful at the cost of simple values of honor and friendship. At the end the director emphasizes the importance of honor and friendship even among gangsters and even women who often ultimately seek the rich guy to live with rather than the true lover.The effect of De Niro's final laugh at the camera can be interpreted in several ways. Who is he laughing at? The camera? The audience? The irony of his life? Is the chase for money worth it? It reminds me of Richard Burton's character, a vicious bank robber in the final shot of the British film ""Villain"" (1971) turns around at the camera and shouts ""Who do you think you are looking at?""Leone could not have made ""Godfather I or II"", but he could have dealt with ""Godfather III"". And Coppola could never have made ""Once upon a time in America"". Leone's decision to change the name of the film from the novel's name ""The Hoods"" gives an indication of where the director is leading the audience.The more you see the film you realize the film is a robust one that will stand the test of time because Leone did not want to merely present an interesting saga on screen but entertain intelligently."
danielmusicone,"Aug 8, 2021",10/10,One of the most important movies of the cinema history. It got all the ingredients a movie need to succeed for the test of time. Ennio Morricone delivers a masterpiece score - in my opinion one of the best soundtracks of the century. The cast is superb. The directing is beautiful.
kurciasbezdalas,"Oct 23, 2008",10/10,"This movie is unbelievable. It's much more interesting and effective than The Godfather. This movie is about the life of one gangster and it's told so perfectly that I feel like I experienced it myself. It's a crime movie but what's different about it is that we get to know everything about main character, like who was his first love, how did he met his friends, what was his first experiences with girls and many other details about his life so it seems like Noodles is a real person which you know all your life. It lasts only 4h but it seems like a life time and not because it's boring but because there is so many twists that it's hard to believe that all this could fit in 4h movie. There is some black humor and violence but that of course is not the most important thing in this film but still makes it even better."

Artimidor,"May 27, 2012",10/10,"Sergio Leone's life-long struggle to make the perfect picture would eventually culminate in a crime fairy-tale on Jewish mobsters, aptly titled ""Once Upon a Time in America"" (1984). And it would hold its ground despite heavy competition of Coppola's well received ""Godfather"" films and the critically acclaimed Scorsese's gangster epics. Made 13 years after his previous picture, Leone's interlude as a producer didn't take away his passion to get the ""America"" project that was in the pipeline finally going. Eventually it bore fruit and would also turn out to be his ultimate one, and maybe his best. In it the former master of spaghetti westerns takes the time to tell a multifaceted story and crams several whole gangster lives into a nearly four hour long epic, still complaining about essential 45 minutes that he was forced to cut. Well, that's Leone for you...At any rate the result is an operatic classic based on the quasi-autobiography of a gangster turned informant, packed with period details of the 1910s, 30s and 60s. It's a nostalgic trip through half a century with time as the key player that washes over the viewer like a mesmerizing, beautiful dream in an opium den, however at the same time feels like a violent nightmare commenting on themes of past vs. present, memory vs. dream, love vs. desire and above all betrayal vs. friendship. Add to the extensive script that was honed for years an array of beautifully photographed scenes, breathtaking Technicolor cinematography and a truly numinous score, and you've got yourself a masterpiece. For it all is married with such a tremendous amount of meticulousness for details that one can't help but get lost in the gangster world of Lower East Side of Manhattan. Aside from Leone's superb visuals, the accompanying music that links times and suggests themes needs special mention as it single-handedly raises the aesthetic level of the whole production by another notch. Created by Ennio Morricone, the famous memories evoking melancholic pan pipes not only fit the film's emotional ride through passing time, but also help to transcend it.The flashback story, with bits and pieces falling into place like in a jigsaw puzzle, is what makes the films so overwhelming, so emotionally intense. This time around a Leone picture however is not so much about landscape and close-ups, but about characters and their environment, the area they live in and their history. De Niro, James Woods, Joe Pesci, Danny Aiello let it all come alive. And at the side of the young Jennifer Connelly the 13 year old unknown Scott Schutzman Tiler plays the young version of the protagonist Noodles and nearly steals the older one's thunder, which is no other than De Niro. On the one hand the street urchin's lightheartedness shines in the character's youth while the veteran actor immerses himself so completely in the aging gangster that the weight of his past becomes almost palpable.Sergio Leone not only made Henry Grey - the man on which the story is loosely based - a larger-than-life monument, but also himself as a grand narrator of adult fairy-tales. Actually, ""Once Upon a Time in America"" is two movies in one, and the overarching flashback structure makes it an unforgettable experience. All that of course was butchered on US release that sank the picture - even more reason to re-discover it as it was intended to be seen, in all its nostalgic glory."
d1494,"Jun 12, 2002",N/A,"I can only say I'm stunned by the poetic beauty of this picture, the incredible haunting music and the terrific acting. The Godfather? Although it has been a longtime favorite, it has been dethroned by this movie. The comparison might be likened to a domestic asiago cheese versus the real thing. ( why such a comparison? For many years I lived above the butcher shop where Francis Copolla would buy his imported asiago and spring goat and home made sausages) This movie is one of those rarest cinematic gems, one of the very few deserving the ultimate accolade, of masterpiece."
diego-armando-gallardo,"Aug 11, 2019",6/10,Some important parts of the plot don't make sense. Doesn't come close to The Godfather...It's a good picture for a Saturday night at home though...The performance of the actors is quite good I shall add.
Nahid_15,"Dec 3, 2020",10/10,"This film is so poetic and beautiful. I'm a huge fan of Robert De Niro and I love gangster films, but for some reason, don't exactly know why, I've been putting this one off for so long. It's such a massive film but everything is so precisely done that you can't help feel absorbed by it.The story's about two best friends Noodles (Robert De Niro) and Max (James Woods) as they rise to become a group of deadly Jewish gangsters from street thugs in New York City, spanning over 50 years or so. As Noodles returns to the city 35 years later who once had to flee following an incident, is now confronted with the life he left behind. The first thirty-nine minutes of the film has mystery, thriller vibe, I was wondering what was going on. Then it goes to the childhood segment of the film which contains some of the best stuff I've ever seen. The entire film has this nostalgic feel to it, growing up and loss of innocence, reaching a certain point in someone's life where they look back to their past, sometimes with regret.The characters are written in a way that they're all flawed human beings. Some of the stuff these characters do really wouldn't set well with you. I was conflicted time to time, seeing these characters doing all these horrible things. As the film has three timelines and it tells the story in a non-linear way, which actually servers it a lot, it tackles different stages of characters' lives rather smoothly. Everyone in this film gives great performances, Especially Robert De Niro and James Woods. I can't say enough about De Niro's performance. His character doesn't say a lot in this film, I mean there weren't like any screaming your lungs out scenes, but his subtle expression lets you know what's he thinking. Ennio Morricone's score is so perfect that it hits every note. The cinematography is magnificent, some of the shots where they captured the landscapes, the old architectures of New York City, the whole look of the film feels authentic.Sergio Leone's Once Upon a Time in America is undoubtedly one of the finest films ever made and calling it an epic is no exaggeration. If it wasn't terribly butchered at the time of its release I think it would've gotten a lot more recognition, which it clearly deserves. You can tell it was unlike any other project he took on as he spent more than a decade to make this film happen. If you do decide to watch it though, don't even think about watching the other versions, just go with the extended cut. It's 4 hours long, it takes its time to take you in, but it's so masterfully constructed that rarely a scene feels irrelevant and it's totally worth it."
johnny-143,"Jun 28, 2001",7/10,"I've seen the short version of this, and the long, and believe me, youmust rent the long version. The short one doesn't do it justice. This isan epic and deserves to be seen as such. It's got great performances byDeNiro and Woods as childhood best pals, and the women areextraordinary- Elizabeth McGovern proves again to be an Americantreasure, and Jennifer Connely- yes, that's her!- is perfectly cast asthe child Elizabeth McGovern. This film also has one of the best scoresyou'll ever hear."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 16, 2023",9/10,"I was so sad to hear the news yesterday that Treat Williams has passed away, so what better way to spend my day off than watching him in this great movie.It must be over a decade ago that I last watched this film, and maybe my taste has changed somewhat, but I felt like I had a greater appreciation and understanding of this film.The one thing I'd forgotten, the running time, I'd this isn't your kind of movie, it's worth remembering that it's just under the four hour mark, and that is too long for some, I was happy to settle down for the afternoon and immerse in this great film.From the get go it doesn't hold back, it's violent, it's brutal, it's not afraid to show the horrors one person can inflict on another. It's pretty much a signal of things to come, some scenes are quite graphic.The story is truly engrossing, there's technically no neat start, middle and end, it's more complex than that, what it does show is some real character development.The visuals are stunning, this is one of the most exquisite looking films ever made, clearly a labour of love for all concerned. The accompanying music is perfect too, it's totally right and fits the flavour of the film.DeNiro at his absolute best, he's in good company here with Woods, Pesci and many others.Great film, just a little too long for a casual viewing.9/10."
garydiamond,"Jul 10, 2007",10/10,"I often go into the viewing of a long film thinking that my patience may not hold out for long enough to see the creative scope and vision in full, that I might forget how the story began. However, having recently seen two movies of similar length - Das Boot and Seven Samurai - both of which I enjoyed, I was willing to put the effort in to see if this critic's favourite could justify it's seemingly endless supply of accolades. The short answer is, it does.It all starts so inauspiciously. We see Noodles (De Niro at the pinnacle of his abilities) a broken, thoughtful man retreading his steps through the town he grew up in. At this start point we have no frame of reference with which to judge this man, no way of telling what his motivations are. Through longer and longer flashbacks we are able to piece together all the moments that define his life, and through those, get a feel for the man, to follow his triumphs and tribulations.As we do so, everything feels smooth and well considered in all aspects of the picture. The pacing is relaxed but never unnecessarily so, and when it does suddenly jolt and change it still feels right, never forced and contrived. We see the way people change and grow in the same way the city around them does. Simple, honest motivations of childhood wealth are traded for conniving betrayals as Noodles and his mobsters reach adulthood. Through the excellent dialogue and subtle expressions and body language of the actors, we are able to see how Noodles and his friends make difficult, character-defining decisions that are often advantageous but always come at cost. The character development from children to successful adults through to the melancholy situation of later years, complete with the many strings attached, is entirely believable.Leone has created a picture so compelling, so consistent, so beautiful and at times so very ugly, that it becomes it's own world. It mirrors aspects of our own life so perfectly that the three and a half hour length is of no consequence. It simply had to be that long in order for the rich fabric of the story to take hold effectively - so that the events of the first forty five minutes can be returned to with what we have learnt enabling us to make sense of it all.An extraordinary masterpiece through and through, and perhaps the only film I'll ever give top marks to. 10/10"
Shambaby,"Nov 17, 2010",10/10,"If you don't understand this movie, wait until you are at least 35 and watch it again. There are so many youngsters writing about ideas they couldn't possibly understand yet. That said, I understood this film on a gut level when I was 20 years old. I saw it four times in the theater on a great huge screen in Chicago. It was and still is one of the greatest movies ever made. The four hour one is the only one approved by Mr. Leone. There is talk of a 41/2 hour version which Leone arranged early on that may still see the light of day. The six-hour version will never be seen, nor will the eight hour version! The atrocity version that Hollywood made can't and shouldn't be seen. There is much to learn about life, children, so give yourselves time to grow up. do some reading and some exploring of life. Crawl out of your little Christian cubicles and learn something new."
ongoam,"Aug 2, 2021",10/10,"Many People think that this is An American Films but It not. This Films was a 1984 English Language Italian Crime Epic directed by the iconic Sergio Leone's, How I like this films, this films was telling the story of Friendship, Love and death and this is the greatest Mafia films that I ever watched of all times."
spex,"Jan 12, 1999",N/A,"One of the great moving pictures of our time.  Actually, I believe it's too short at 226 minutes.  Six-to-eight hours would have allowed for the necessary character development, and would have elevated the work to a new level.  The director's cut, however, is phenomenal.  Leone's re-creation of 1920s Lower East Side street life is breathtaking; the child actors are captivating (some feel they outshone Woods and DeNiro); the score will haunt you long after the closing credits.  No need to feel angry at Warner Bros. for the marketing disaster that clouded this film's original release (they sliced it to 88 minutes -- Danger, Will Robinson!  steer clear of this version -- secure a copy of the 226-minute director's cut at all costs!) -- we have the director's cut and we are happy. The fact that Once Upon a Time in America did not score big at the box office has no bearing on the quality of what you'll find on the video tapes.  Trust me."
perica-43151,"Jan 25, 2022",7/10,"While the 4 hour cut of the movie is nowadays celebrated as one of the greatest movies ever, it falls far short of masterpieces like Godfather, or other Leone's work. Sure, it has some nice childhood growing-of-gangster-age story, has a few memorable scenes, but the whole 60s section of the movie, which might be a pipe dream, is not so great, and the story, however you interpret it, is not as remarkable. It also all but celebrates rapes done by De Niro character (well cast as rapey gangsters fit his overblown persona nicely, and especially delusional self-absolving and lets forget about my misdeeds and stupidity attitude whilst judging others, in a self-righteous, with zero basis in reality, way). The gratuitous rape sequences and plenty of nudity fit somewhat better into Felliniesque European film tradition, Leone is not Fellini and thus the whole narrative seems to glorify mobster immoralities in a way more subtle works, like Godfather, never do. Subversive element is all but lost and all that is left is not so great, but still solid, ponderings of the older Leone. If you expect a masterpiece on par with Godfather or the best of Leone's own work, you might be quite disappointed. If you expect an overlong movie with some amusing growing of age story that celebrates rape and speaks of rationalizations of the corrupt peoples, with great film music and nice shots, it might be quite OK."
shinrisen,"Feb 19, 2023",7/10,"I've just spend 4 hours watching the director's cut of this film, so I'll be keeping it brief.Once Upon a Time in America has great acting performances, an iconic soundtrack, dynamic camerawork, brilliant set and costume design and I can understand that it's a 'classic' movie.However, it feels very drawn out. I don't mind slow movies but I feel like there were some scenes that could've been shorter without losing any of its impact. Some of the 'added' DC scenes were pretty great though and added some context to the ongoing events. The script is good and the movie is good, I just think that I could've loved this film if it was half the length.7.5/8."

Bill-309,"Feb 1, 1999",10/10,"This ranks easily as the best film ever - 10 of 10; an all-star cast led by Woods and DeNiro with strong support from Burt Young and Tuesday Weld. Don't EVER see the U.S. original version- it was cut to pieces - the Director's Cut is perfect.Some effort is involved to follow the story line, but becomes clear as the movie progresses.  The haunting theme song will stay with you a long time and the character development is excellent.If you like action and drama, don't miss this one!!!!"

user-805-903788,"Jun 15, 2016",10/10,"This is my first review on IMDb. I feel so emotional about this movie that I need to write something to recommend this movie.Frankly, this movie is a bit too long. For the first hour, I have no idea what the movie is talking about. But as the story unfolds, I am more and more attracted to the amazing gangster world. De Niro's acting is wonderful. With so few words, he manages to convey so much. As for the plot, the story is very unique in its design. It doesn't follow the time-line. Rather, it unfolds like memory, with a poetic beautiful touch. Another great aspect about this movie is the wonderful melody, composed by Ennio Morricone. It is indeed an indispensable part of the whole story.For post-95 like myself, Once Upon a Time in America is unlike any movie commonly seen today. It takes time to get into the setting, but it's definitely worth the effort."

ajzaza-26448,"Oct 4, 2022",10/10,"I stayed up to watch this masterpiece. It's almost 4 hours. But it's probably the best movie I've ever seen. It's without doubt Sergio Leone's greatest work.It's by far the best gangster movie ever made. By comparison movies like the Godfather or Goodfellas seem like a juvenile and superficial glamorization of violence. This movie shows the glamor but also the regret of this part of American history.It has some of the most interesting editing showing how strange memory and the passage of time is. It's a movie about regrets about the past, but it also reminds you of how like a dream our life is."
popart,"Jun 12, 2003",N/A,"What makes this movie better then the Godfather films - The storytelling structure of the way the film is put together. The way time and space are overlapped with one another is just sheer brilliance. Kubrick in his film `The Killing' made a great attempt at it and it worked very well in that film but here in `Once Upon a Time in America' one sees and experiences it in it's most pure and perfectly conceived form as of yet ever done in any film that has been made to date. The Director frames his shots most uniquely and everything becomes interesting and important. I have never seen or experienced another film quite like this one. Being almost 4 hours long it seems to pass by like a well paced 90 min feature. That's just how good this movie is. I have seen this film many times on Video, Laser Disc, and now the long awaited DVD release. (More on the DVD in a moment) fantastic character development like the Jennifer Connelly/Elizabeth McGovern girl, the two blend so well that when I first saw the movie I thought it was the same girl, and the mythic way that Elizabeth McGovern moves thru the film, she stays the eternal myth that never ages as all else ages around her, this is conveyed brilliantly in her old age make-up - She still looks like a young girl and yet you can see the age wrinkles, it is simply genius. Then there is the back-story when they are kids, it's a film in it's self and so wonderfully presented. So many other aspects of this film have been talked about by others I will leave that and talk of the DVD release - I couldn't wait until this DVD came out, I rushed to Virgin Records and bought a copy the day it came out, it look beautiful except for the glitches and the fact that disc one ends right in the middle of a scene and does not match the index at all. Well I thought it was just a bad disc so I returned it for another DVD of the film and when I watched that one it was the same, So I'm going to return this on in the morning. Looks like they rushed this one out. Beware. Get the Video (if you can or better yet the Laser Disc)  Major disappointment over this DVD. Someone Goofed on this. I hope the next DVD that I get after I return this one will prove to be better."

skepticskeptical,"Jan 26, 2020",7/10,"I am aware that those who rave over Once Upon a Time in America will find my gentle reproach a clear sign of the ignorance of philistines. But let us be perfectly frank: many of the scenes are larded with fat which could easily have been cut, increasing the pace and even leaving space to set up the surprise ending rather than dropping it in like (the filmmaker´s cardinal sin) a deus ex machina.The scenes of the youngsters in New York City evoke immediate memories of The Godfather, part 2, but that comparison did not help but harmed this viewer´s reception of Leone´s alleged chef d´oeuvre, because similar scenes in Coppola´s work are so much better plotted and paced. The true accomplishment of this work is to persuade viewers to sympathize and identify with murderers and rapists--pretty impressive that we find ourselves not hating but liking the main characters at the end. Both Robert DeNiro and James Woods gave excellent performances.I do not have a problem with extra-long films, if there is a reason for their length (Lawrence of Arabia, Apocalypse Now...). As far as I am concerned, the surest sign that Once Upon a Time in America is not a bona fide masterpiece is that I had to watch it over three nights to get through it. Good, but not great."
Petey-10,"Dec 20, 2004",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America depicts the lives of Jewish gangsters starting from their childhood.Sergio Leone directed this long masterpiece twenty years ago, in 1984.This was his final direction.As usually, Ennio Morricone made the score for this movie, like he did to numerous Leone movies.The cast is something to remember.There are people like Robert De Niro, James Woods, Elizabeth McGovern, Burt Young, Danny Aiello, William Forsythe, James Hayden, Estelle Harris of Seinfeld and the young Jennifer Connelly in her movie debut.Those three things combined make this movie a masterpiece; Leone's direction, Morricone's score and the acting work.Some may say this epic is too long for them, I'd say you just have to have patience."

shardik,"May 8, 2000",10/10,"I think this movie would break IMDB's top 50 if all the viewers saw the REAL version of this movie - the 224 minute epic that was Sergio Leone's directorial swan song.  Ennio Morricone's music has always been at its apex when Leone was involved and it's the same right here - the music is stunningly moving and enhances the passage of time.  Frame by frame scenes, the quality of the film, the music, the acting (brilliant - with my main man Deniro ..aka GOD) and a volatile James Woods makes you feel like you've lived an entire life of someone when you see this movie.  Although The Godfather and the trilogy are my favorite movies of all time - this movie along with the GFather trilogy are perhaps the only ones who make the viewer well and truly feel like they've taken a lifelong journey - literally living a life. But this film gets credit for doing so with 3.5 hours - without any sequels.  A brilliant, sad, moving and enriching experience."

soundoflight,"Jun 5, 2018",5/10,"Is ""Once Upon a Time in America"" praised because of what it is, or because of who made it? I would argue that it is the latter, as Sergio Leone has been raised to a mythical status due to his unique directing talents and the success of the four western films he directed. Despite what Leone brought to this film (and his signature techniques are all at work here), that alone does not make a great film, and unfortunately ""Once Upon a Time in America"" suffers from several key shortcomings.The main one of these shortcomings is simply the plot, which is too cumbersome, and once put through the wringer of the pacing and time-jumping, simply doesn't hold up as interesting enough to justify the 4 hour runtime of the extended version (the version Leone intended, apparently). By the end of the film I was deflated and bored, and the ending itself did nothing to change that. There was a gem of a good story in here - Leone knew that - but I don't think he succeeded in bringing it out. And many of the scenes seemed to be there only to provide shock value. Leone's earlier work was much ""tighter,"" where every shot seemed to matter.The music and soundtrack are also a bit jarring. I think this was Leone's weak spot through most of his films. His repetition of musical themes in a film worked OK for his westerns, but in this film in particular, it becomes wearisome to hear the same cloying theme for the 50th time over 4 hours. I found myself distracted by the music and wishing it wasn't there behind the dialogue much of the time.So despite some glimmers of brilliance, even the fully restored version of ""Once Upon a Time in America"" rings flat for me. Due to the years of delays in getting this film off the ground, he missed his window and the ""gangster"" genre was already tired when this film came out (and arguably it's even more tired today). And unlike his westerns, which were sort of meta-films as they came after the hay-day of the format. ""Once Upon a Time in America"" just feels like one of the pack."

y-14459,"Mar 28, 2022",10/10,"Despite the film being almost 4 hours long, I was never bored during the film, with the beautiful score and cinematography, the great writing and characters, the themes of regret, desire, betrayal, etc. Without it feeling disjointed, this film has it all and I don't think there should be any scene that should be omitted. This is honestly my favorite Sergio Leone film, which considering he's the director of the Dollars Trilogy is saying a lot, and one of the greatest gangster movies of all time. Also the theatrical cut does not make any sense because it cuts out half of the film's runtime and is in chronological order, which ruins the films pacing, so watch it in all it's glory with the 4 hour long cut so you can experience Sergio Leone's magnum opus."
aattanas,"Jan 5, 2003",10/10,"Sergio Leone's film ""Once upon a time in America"" is a movie that can not be compared with any other. It tells a lengthty but fruitful tale of jewish gangsters from the early 1920's through the late 1960's.  Sergio Leone has created a completely authentic visual representation of a time that has long since past. The film has tremendous acting courtesy of, Robert De Niro, James Woods, Tuesday Weld, Elizabeth McGovern, and Jennifer Connelly (who would go on to win the best actress oscar for 2001's ""A beautiful mind."") Even the smaller roles were equally impressive. To name a few: Joe Pesci, Burt Young, Scott Tiler, Rusty Jacobs, and the most entertaining, Danny Aiello. The script leaves no stone unturned in the tragic lives of the characters. The directing is as beautiful as Ennio Morricone's unforgettable and mesmerizing score. This movie may be a challenge for those who have difficulty sitting through long films. ""Once upon a time in America"" clocks at 3 hours & 47 minutes. This is the long version. Steer clear of the horiffic shorter version. Despite the films length, this film does not drag at all. As there is never a dull moment. This film is a complete masterpiece and it deserves a rating no lower than a 10."
solom84,"Jul 24, 2007",6/10,"This is my 1st comment here I noticed that any movie containing & praising god's favorite people(as they think) doesn't go under 8/10 but i couldn't let this one go because it's really disappointing.In short,this movie concentrates on sex more than needed& it doesn't need to be 3 hrs long.So if u haven't watched it,u didn't miss anything at all.i know that my comment is short but i really regret wasting my time on this movie.it lacks suspense& even good action is rarei give it 6.0"
aimeksa,"Apr 5, 2004",10/10,"One of the few films I've seen that has a strong romance mixed with violence, friendship, loyalty, tears and gunshots!This film was originally released in the US in a format that destroyed it's sense and ultimately destroyed the movie. In other countries we were able to see it as the director Sergio Lone, intended.Now the mistake is fixed and the released DVD shows the movie as it should have always been.Don't be fooled by the length of this film, you will be left wanting more.The cast is impeccable the story is perfect and the music is just magic.It's really a masterpiece..."
mafberthold,"Nov 30, 2023",1/10,"Very strange movie that seems to have been made by competent people but is totally anti-moral. All of the people you follow as the heroes goes on unmotivated rape escapades that seem to be just there without comment or analysis. Never seen this in a movie before and i am both bewildered and appaled. Wtf was going through their minds when they produced this?The message seems to be that all women on earth are scum who not only should expect to be treated like sexslaves, they deserve it to...I would not recommend this movie to anyone under any circumstance since i would be branded as a rape lover, and rightfully so. If you like this movie, there is something seriously wrong with you: seek help and dont mention liking this movie to anyone."
rafaelherschel,"Mar 6, 2011",10/10,"Once Upon a Time in America is a great film. A true classic.Once Upon a Time in America is a great film. A true classic. A grim and sometimes confusing fairytale with gangsters. The film can be ugly and (deliberately) confusing, but is also mesmerizing and beautiful.Avoid if you want to see a traditional gangster film or a fast paced action film. See it if you are willing to view a film that offers no definite answers, features ambivalent characters and has a dreamlike representation of time and memory.The movie is full of historical detail, but at the same time an interpretation of the myth of this period in American history (20's and 30's of the 20th century). Likewise, the story is not always realistic but an interpretation of what has happened, of what might have happened and perhaps of what is going to happen.Some scenes are very unpleasant, but necessary to explain the true nature of the characters and the world they live in."

whitelodge-541-232399,"Dec 1, 2020",10/10,"This is Sergio Leone his masterpiece. But we live in strange times, it's almost 2021. Reading most reviews from 2019 on, this absute amazing epic doesn't get the love anymore as it used too. Its not the films fault, it's the damn kids of today, most, not all, who have no patience for a long film or like to pen down Deniro stuff because of their lust object, President Drump. They can't be taken seriously though, everything in this movie is brilliant, and I mean everything! But those millennial a... holes will always be as...s, so they are irrelevant, they shouldn't even be allowed to write about this absute classic film. It's better than any gangster film because it's not a gangster film. It's a thriller, it's a dream, it's reality, it's about life and death, it's about love, it's about betrayal, it's about not so sympathetic people but yet we are fascinated by them, it's about America, a strange place, corrupt, yet its also fascinating and beautiful, filled with gangsters, hoods and the American dream that is an illusion. The music is by Ennio Morricone and is one of the best scores of a time. Neither of those kids or republican 2020 seem to mention this. Politics today made those little rascals trols 2020, a bunch of pathetic people with Internet, penning down stuff they secratly like but write a bad review because they like penning stuff everyone else likes. That my friends make you a not very serious film reviewer and makes you irrelevant. Once upon a time in America is a classic and will be here for a long long time to enjoy."
byhofes,"Jul 21, 2021",8/10,"Successful gangster film by the director famous for his wester films. The first 30 minutes of the movie may seem meaningless, but if you make it to the end, you will see it again. The looks and silent scenes are a bit long. Overall enjoyable movie 10/8.6."
marosari00,"Nov 25, 2007",10/10,"The film stirred memories of my childhood as I walked the streets of NY. The friends made in the streets, and the brownstones alleys and roofs. The expressions, the mannerisms, voice inflections are perfect. As you watch it over and over (the 4 hours version) more and more can be appreciated and new things just come clearer. The visions of young love (lust)through the wall cutout. The sadness of watching the young lad waiting for Pegola as he ate the whipped cream cupcake. This movie made me happy, sad, brought the proverbial lump to the throat especially when Bugsy kills the youngest of the gang, while feeling the hatred of Bugsy's payback from the hands of Noodles. Enough cannot be said about this film.This movie is a personal favorite."

Paul-65,"Oct 16, 1998",N/A,"Superb, the only word I can think of to describe this film.  It is, from start to finish nothing short of outstanding.  To think that it is as long as it is is unbelievable as the film fairly flys past whilst you are watching.James Woods gives an incredible performance and the remainder of the cast don't do too badly either.  The plot is captivating (if a little controversial at times - rape is a hard thing to watch) and along with some excellent direction, you are drawn into the world of the film with ease.I would recommend this film to anybody, except before you watch, you must be prepared to be shocked at times."
ma-cortes,"Jan 5, 2023",7/10,"Sergio Leone's three-hour, forty-minute epic masterpiece starring Robert de Niro dealing with a group of mobster from infancy to adultness. This is an epic and powerful story of an unforgettable era providing terrific interpretations and surprising happenings . Concerning the group of good friends from growing up in the rough Jewish neighborhood of New York's Lower East Side in the 1920s to the last years of Prohibition in the early 1930s, through to the late 1960s, where an elderly Noodles (Robert De Niro) returns to New York after many years in hiding to look into the past .The film takes place in 1920, 1932, 1933, and 1968. As boys, they made a pact to share their fortunes, their loves, their lives . As men (Robert De Niro , James Woods , William Forsythe, James Hayden) , they shared a dream to rise from poverty to power. Forging an empire built on greed, violence and betrayal, their dream would end as a mystery that refused to die. It starts in 1968, David ""Noodles"" Aaronson, returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan, New York City from a prolonged absence. He has been called back under strange circumstances: he's received a notice from a local rabbi telling him that the cemetery in his old neighborhood is being closed and the remains of those buried there are being moved , while he attempts to rekindle his old flame (Elizabeth McGovern) .Crime, passion and lust for power - Sergio Leone's explosive saga of gangland America !. In the 20's he was a street punk , in the 30's he was a crook. In the 60's he is the key to a lifelong mystery !. As boys, they said they would die for each other. As men, they did.Italian director Leone's richly rewarding and breathtaking gangster epic . A forty-five-year saga in New York City that's told from the perspective of De Niro's Noodles as an old man looking back at 40 years of love , crime , death and along the way confronting the ghosts and regrets of his old life. This release culminates ten years of planning and false starts for the filmmaker and it was well worth the wait . A big production about 30 million dollars with excellent production design , impressive scenarios , and the greatest actors . There are various versions , of course the best is the uncut retelling of director Leone , a 143 minutes runtime , others are heavily edited. Enjoyable sense of a complex drama , Carlo Simi's stunning settings , Tonino Delli Colli's colorful cinematography and Ennio Morricone's sensitive musical score make this big-budgeted tale highly effective . With special mention for Morricone soundtrack , in fact , to establish adequate atmosphere , bits of Ennio Morricone's music were performed during filming . Rated R for profanity , nudism, suggested sex and violence.The motion picture was competently written/directed by Sergio Leone and narrated with a sweeping and violent elegance. This was Sergio Leone's final feature movie and his first in 13 years since Duck you sucker !. It takes part of the 2ª Leone trilogy formed by : Duck you sucker ! , Once upon a time in the West and Once upon a time in America . While 1ª Leone trilogy is formed by : Fistful of dollars , For a fistful of dollars more , and The Good , the Bad abd the Ugly . For Leone enthusiasts with his usual trademarks , it's full of which made his films so memorable, others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of world-wide popularity . Rating : 7.5/10 . Essential and indispensable watching ."
j.dawson,"Aug 25, 2000",10/10,"One of the best movies ever made? Yeah, cliche comment you've heard before. But here Leone operates on every level a movie can, it exemplifies what the medium offers for possibilities. You can read it on many levels; a mythical gangster epic, or an allegory of the rise of American capitalism perhaps. But mostly, it's a truly masterful piece of direction. BTW - whatever you do - see the full 4 hour version, not any studio-butchered shorter versions. Laugh, cry, and think."
asd29,"Feb 28, 2019",7/10,"This epic gangster flick is mostly entertaining the story is plausible enough to keep you watching but most of the violence in this film is aimed mostly at women and theres elements of sexual degrigation towards women which will be quite disturbing for some viewers especially women! but all the star performances in this movie are all above par and does hit the mark on a narrative scale its interesting and it makes you bothered to sit through its afternoon long running time, its stands alone opposite other films in this genre including the godfather, goodfellas, scarface, its a different animal. 7/10"
bbernstein68,"Jun 2, 2001",1/10,"Don't be fooled by the cast - even DeNiro and James Woods couldn't save this screenplay. I am very surprised so many people seemed to give this movie a good review. The story and dialog was contrived and unbelievable. Even a scene with a young boy dying, which normally would cause a viewer to feel empathy or loss, was made comical by the ridiculous acting. A huge waste of time in every way. Nothing redeeming about this movie at all."
ericgw46,"Jun 12, 2011",10/10,"Brilliant! If ever a film depicted the highs & lows of 'gangster' time in the USA this is the one. The right scope of actors were used for this, & of course they acted to express their emotions explicitly! A truly wonderful film that was never acknowledged by the powers that be.......! The score was also marvelous, whenever i feel like chilling out, i just play the soundtrack with a double espresso & a large cognac & when Deborah's theme is played, WOW, i get goosebumps, its so haunting! i can see the beautiful Elizabeth McGovern every time! I understand the film is gonna be edited to the original time band of 269 minutes, well i cant wait to see what we missed!"
moose_malone,"Oct 19, 2003",10/10,"People who complain that this film is slow and that it's self indulgent should stick to films more suited to their tastes, such as xXx or other such plotless action drivel. You think this is slow?! You try cramming 50 years into 4 hours! Leonne fought for ten years to get this film made, only to have it unceremoniously butchered at the hands of some half-wit hack. Now we get to experience his true vision, and what a vision it is. Once upon a time in America is a fitting final creation from one of the greatest film-makers of all time, as it is one of the greatest films of all time-***** out of *****"
eamon-hennedy,"Nov 3, 2003",10/10,"Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In America is undeniably a masterpiece. A superb film on every level, it feels like the brother of The Godfather Films. While both this film and the Godfather Part II make use of the flashback structure and both feature Robert De Niro, all comparisons end there as this is a vastly different film. Yes they are both gangster films, but this is a different kettle of fish. Whereas the main theme of the Godfather films is that of family, here we deal with the role of friendship in the life of the gangster and how betrayal can lead to bitter recriminations and heartache. However it doesn't just tell the story of gangster betrays friends, oh no, it goes deeper than that. We go into a world where you question the events depicted and the role many characters play. This is a film with no easy answers and with it comes difficult questions. This is essentially the more deeper cousin of The Godfather films. We come to question whether or not the sequences in the 1960's are real. Is it just a dream concocted  by De Niro in the Opium den. It this a possible future, but one that is only possible. What about the brief case. Whereas in Pulp Fiction the case is more of a running joke, here it seems like a plot point that we have missed all of a sudden, while one also has to question why Noodles goes on to rape the woman he supposedly loves in one of the film's most shocking sequences.To be honest I don't think Once Upon A Time In America is as good as The Godfather films, but it is a worthy film to be lined alongside Coppola's legacy. The story by Leone and his direction are first class, De Niro shows us why he is considered by many to be the finest actor working in American cinema today, while James Woods proves that no one can play a psychopath like himself. Then there is Ennio Morricone's music. Sublime and perfect, like The Godfather films, Once Upon a Time In America is complimented with a fine music score that adds gravitas to an already fine film.Every part of this film is superb. The origin of the friendship between Max and Noodles is wonderfully done, the middle time frame sequences were we see the release of Noodles from prison and his reintegration with his friends and how it all leads to the ultimate act of betrayal and the later stages were an older Noodles reflects in the 60's all work well together. This film could have been a long, meandering sprawling bore fest, but instead it is one of the finest films committed to celluloid. However, it is not a film that is easily recommended. Nearly four hours long, very violent, containing a horrifying rape scene and an ending that  only leaves you with more question, I'm not surprised that many have been divided over it, but I love it. It is quite simply a work of art."
id9877,"Oct 1, 2020",10/10,The only problem of his masterpiece is that Sergio made a movie far beyond the understanding of his audience
robfollower,"Mar 20, 2019",10/10,"A former Prohibition-era Jewish gangster returns to the Lower East Side of Manhattan over thirty years later, where he once again must confront the ghosts and regrets of his old life.The way the movie was cut is also the reason why a lot of Americans don't think this movie is very special. There are three versions, but only the European version is how the director imagined it to be. He didn't want his movie to be shown in chronological order (1910's - 1930's - 1960's), but wanted to mix these three periods of time. The studio cut the movie in chronological order, loosing a lot of its originality and therefor getting a lot of bad critics. If you want to see this film the way Sergio Leone saw it, you have to make sure you get the director's cut 4 hours & 11 minutes running time.Once Upon A Time In America is the crowning achievement of director Sergio Leone. It demands total concentration from beginning to end. However,those willing to submit will find it more than worth it.What really makes this film different is it's overwhelming melancholy. Leone's favourite loyalty/betrayal theme is there,but the film is also a study of memory,of a lost soul coming to terms with his past.The acting in this film is an absolute joy to behold. This is one of the best De Niro performances.While an unlikeable character, Noodles is a very interesting study of a broken life. He is matched every step of the way by an exceptional James Woods as Max. Woods has said that this is his favourite performance of his. The younger cast members, including a 12 year-old Jennifer Connelly, are especially effective during the flashback sequences.The combination of Sergio Leone and Ennio Morricone is epic and the mix of actors are outstanding. Sergio Leone's epic crime drama is visually stunning, stylistically bold, and emotionally haunting."
Richie-67-485852,"Nov 6, 2017",10/10,"Bravo! Everyone connected with this movie should take a long well-deserved bow. Most excellent entertainment across the board bar none. All my favorite actors are at their peak plus the supporting players came through as well. If that is not enough, treat yourself to one of the best scores you will ever hear too. The music when applied to certain scenes just tugs and pulls on you until you give in and you are glad that you did too. There are different versions out there to experience. I found the blue-ray 251 minute version which Leone had a hand in and it made good sense. I have seen the other versions and I couldn't quite figure out what was going on even after I was captivated. Imagine that if it held you when chopped up it will spellbind you when complete. It does! Let us not forget that the story itself of gangsters, murders, robberies prostitution etc. can never be glorified and encouraged as a way of life in real life. Quite the opposite. It is a life misspent even it is exciting and dangerous to live in a perverted way. It reminds me of The Godfather movie where we fall in love with Don Corleone but lets be clear he was a bad man. What comes through here in this movie is the magic of growing up, having friends, doing things together, first loves and adventures. What hurts is seeing all those things fail or not complete themselves. This movie gives you both and then some. You have to stop and think about what Tuco said in the Good, Bad & Ugly to his brother. In this town, in order to survive, one becomes a priest or a bandit. Same with this movie only minus the priest part. These kids growing up on the streets have nothing worthwhile to look forward to accept trouble that brings excitement or jail. In between they hope for money, food, a better life and that it gets easier not harder. Street life is like that. You get to glimpse very well this no where type of existence courtesy of expert directing here. It would take someone who knew about this type of growing up to present correctly and more importantly with deep feeling and genuineness. This movies delivers that and more. Haunting, reflective, deep, pain, sorrow and mystery rolled up altogether using peoples lives to make the points. That's why the viewer can relate so well. It could have been and in many cases was...your life too. Recommend a meal while watching with a tasty drink and a decent snack. Make sure you have enough for three plus hours. I have seen this at least three times. I am not through either....."
PlanecrazyIkarus,"Sep 16, 2002",N/A,"The story of the movie takes place in three different layers - each being a certain part of the main protagonist's life. First, there is his adolescence, where he slowly turns from rascal to junior gangster. Then there is his adult life in his gang, and finally, his return as old man to his old home city, after 30 years of hiding in excile.The movie begins with a crucial scene: The death of his gang. The rest of the movie tries to tell the story of that event - how it came about, mostly.But all of this does not capture the spirit of the movie: The summary of the story pretends that there is some sort of development, some movement. Yet the movie manages to slowly ooze from set to set, from time layer to time layer, without ever generating excitement, without ever feeling as if the story was progressing. There is painfully little dialogue - and whatever there is is slow. How many times does one character ask a question, only to receive the answer after a long break, during which his opposite pretends to be lost in thought or emotion or just lost? As a consequence, none of the characters seem real. Given the cast and director, it is probably considered a sacrilege to point this out: But whatever they were doing for this movie, they were not in the least succeeding in portraying life, or lifelike performances. Perhaps on some other planet, frozen in liquid nitrogen, there are life forms with reaction times similar to those depicted in the movie - but on earth people tend to talk, and act, and live, a lot quicker. Stealing well over three hours of our lives for this movie is way too much.The only explanation is that this movie tries to be a piece of art - not entertainment. Which would make it a fairly ugly piece of art, showing prostitution, sex, drugs, violence, perverted sex, rape and almost every element that could shock or thrill, but without thrilling. And there are only two scenes in the entire movie that manage to shock. If it is to be seen as art, then perhaps they should have told the story as a long series of still images, as opposed to a movie (i.e. similar to the French ""movie"" that inspired ""Twelve Monkeys""). That way, the entire thing would not have felt so awkward and out of place, and perhaps, it could be more appreciated. Especially the soundtrack, as background to a series of images, would have made this a piece of art. In this movie, it feels oddly dominating - where there is little talk, the music is very noticeable. It is the only character that won't shut up...In the end, the movie tries so hard to be a classic, it feels obvious and annoying. The ending is confusing, and everything between start and end is boring.3/10"
said-buet10,"Oct 5, 2017",8/10,"This movie is huge. I've seen the massive 229 min cut. And surprisingly it did not feel that boring! The pace was slow but for this story it was absolutely necessary. Otherwise the story wouldn't fell the way it felt. I was tired but also satisfied when this ended.The acting was fitting. The child actors did an amazing job. In some cases I think even better than their adult counterparts.One might get confused at the way this movie is shown. The constant switching between present time and the past might seem weird but its a massive buildup for the last segment. Once a person sees it all, he/she would understand why it was shown that way and would for sure appreciate the making.The long shots and the enthralling musical score that shows and makes sure channels all the emotions into the viewers was expected from Sergio Leone. I always enjoyed his work and this didn't underperformed at all. It's sad that this was his last movie.This was an epic tale and one of the best crime dramas I've seen so far. Too bad that it was a commercial mess due to a trimmed version being released in theater. I would recommend the whole 229 min version to anyone anytime."
JayWolfgramm,"Jan 6, 2025",6/10,"""Once Upon a Time in America"" is a tricky movie to review. The film had various production issues, mainly surrounding the runtime of the movie. The version now released is 3 hours 49 minutes. The theatrical release was cut down to a 2-hour version. Leone's original plan had the footage at 6 hours, planning on it to be 2 movies. It says something about the film, that I would be interested in seeing those alternate versions. But I will try not to speculate about what could have been, but instead focus on what we got here, the 229-minute version. And what we have here... is a mixed bag.Starting with the positives, the music by Ennio Morricone is, shock, really really good. The soundtrack is able to capture a specific melancholy reminiscing feeling that only Morricone and Beatles songs can do.Also, when the movie focuses on the 4 gangsters using their street smarts to outdo the law and rivals it leads to some very creative and clever scenes. The solutions rely less on money and manpower, but more on simple ingenuity.It might be obvious, given the reputation of those involved, but it's worth mentioning. The actors all do a great job. De Niro feels like he was born to play a gangster. James Woods has a lot of emotional explosions that he has to sell, and he delivers on these big reactions.Now it is time for the negative side. I will concede, some of these are personal gripes, but this is my review, so these are my problems. This movie has a lot of scenes that are just hard to watch. The world is unpleasant. And I get it, the director is not glamorizing the gangster life. The feeling of regret permeates the story. That doesn't mean I want to see a sexual assault. I won't go into all the grizzly details; you can check the parental guide if you want to know.About the first 100 minutes focuses on De Niro and the gang as 12 year old kids. This whole section of the movie is dull. And at some points I feel like I should be on some sort of watchlist for looking at this stuff. The section of the movie that's ""GoodFella Babies"" is not what I'm looking for.Likewise, the section of the movie that has old man De Niro, is overly long. Once again, I get why they needed to frame the story in this way. But every time they cut to him reminiscing, any momentum is killed, and it just an old man wandering around.Overall, there is a lot of good parts in the film. You just have to sit through a lot of middling stuff and some filth in order to get to it. Some may disagree, but that's what is great about America, you are free to have your own opinion."
aidankilburn,"May 8, 2021",1/10,I was really looking forward to watching this film. It was such a disappointing experience.Left me feeling flat.Four hours 9 minutes of torture.Quite how this film was given a rating of 8.4 is mystifying. I will never get those four hours back.
mahmus,"Mar 20, 2020",10/10,"It sits alongside the Godfather trilogy amongst one of the greatest, most ambitious gangster epics of all time.
Robert De Niro gives a complex and multi-layered performance (after all, he's an expert at playing gangsters), the cinematography is beautiful, the direction is fantastic and the score by Ennio Morricone is, as always, perfection.
Did I mention this movie is long?
It's nearly four hours long.
Apparently there is a two hour long version that was originally released in theaters, but apparently it's also pretty bad.
If you're intersted in watchig this, watch the longer, true version. It's a masterpiece."
OferShabi,"Jan 26, 2022",10/10,"This review is probably redundant given this is an all-time classic . I'm no cinema expert , but do consider cinema created between 1975 - to about the late 90's the gold era of cinema . Once Upon a Time in America is no doubt one of the greatest films of that era .This film has it all . Distorted childhood , crime & violence , love , corruption , friendship , patriarchal America (and world) to borderline and direct abuse of woman abundant at those times , to old romance , and evolving characters which the film accompanies from childhood to old age . The film achieves all that in about 3 hours , a feat hard enough that even TV series's features today with many seasons don't deepen to .The film jumps from the character's life's in the 30's , to the 50's ( just guessing ) and to the 80's with beautiful and unique visual appearance of both place and character , which makes it one of the most authentic feeling films ever . Those times are presented at times in a shocking unapologetic way , which only contributes to the film's realness . Once upon a time shoves the old poverty , crime and those cruel and confused , but still beautiful times in the viewers face in the most direct way . The criminals , the violent ,the rich & corrupt , the rapists , and those caught in between are presented without hesitation and without deviation , in a bustle of a city of colliding interests both cruel , criminal and humane .In contrary , with some characters the film does present a lot of gray lines and margins for the viewer . Can a criminal killing , stealing and raping be somewhat good ? Is his actions more understandable because of the time , place or the people involved ? Once upon a time has the viewer jumping from love , to hate , to pity , to understanding them . By the time the film is finished , you will be pondering for days about the special characters , and your affection & hate and understanding towards them . It says allot about life at that time , maybe you can feel all of those towards the characters ? And maybe after days you have a headache from overthinking about it , and feel little of all of those feelings ? In the end , I think personally I just accepted the story , the characters and the good and bad they went trough as it is , like they were real .To sum it all , the acting by all is epic , all aspects of the film are detailed to an uncompromising level . The characters involved feel real , deep , and the film leaves you with a very high level of perceived acquaintanceship with the time and characters , to an extant you find yourself missing an era , place and people you never knew , lived or experienced .Yes , it's a must watch , no doubt about it ."
OldTimer-6,"Sep 18, 1999",10/10,"First of all, avoid the shortened version like the proverbial plague. The only one a serious moviegoer should invest his time watching is the full length film, which clocks in at 227 minutes.Secondly, to attempt to summarize this film would be to do it an injustice. No matter how well intentioned, there is no way a capsule review could begin to properly illustrate how powerful, moving and ultimately surprising this movie really is. Robert de Niro's ""Noodles"" is quietly understated...yet, it is his story that we follow from start to finish. A truly outstanding performance from a master of the genre.James Woods gives his character, Max, his usual intensity. Beyond this, he also fleshes out the individual so we feel we know him at many different levels. Still, the question ""do we REALLY know Max?"" constantly confronts the viewer throughout the film. His quick shifts from shrewd wisdom to angry confrontation rings true. The end result is that the story of these two criminal friends, covering the years from youth to old age, is believable every step of the way.The other cast members are all up to the task. Far too many to name individually, suffice it to say that ""the gang"" and the adversaries are equally outstanding. Director Sergio Leone, who had already created several masterpieces (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly; A Fistful of Dollars; Once Upon a Time in the West) surpasses them all (in my opinion) with this opus.Hint: Approximately the first half hour of the long version (again...do yourself a favor and don't waste your time and money on the short one) makes no apparent sense. Or so it would seem, as we time-hop back and forth from era to era. DO NOT GIVE UP! When Noodles takes a look through a hole in the wall at a dancing girl, you can be assured that the story is finally beginning to coalesce. Everything you have seen prior to that is foreshadowing, and will make complete sense by the time you've reached the conclusion."
Paco-39,"Jul 11, 1999",10/10,"This movie is really shocking, beggining with ENNIO'S MORRICONE MUSIC, I THINK AND MAYBE SOME PEOPLE WOULD AGREE, that this is the greatest music written for a film ever, pieces like AMAPOLA, that gives the MELANCHOLIC, sad feeling to the movie.The Sergio Leone's crude epic-drama of a group of friends, that would do everything to get to power, in the 1910's Manhattan.A history of betrayal, ambition, friendship, poverty, that cast of Hollywood's greatest: De Niro, Wood, Pesci, Burt Young, mixed with Sergio Leone's genius to direct, and make a excellent portrayal of the dark side of the american dream.A very shocking, strong, powerful film, combined with Morrocone's music, make this film ONE OF THE UN-NOTICED GREAT FILMS OF ALL TIMES, ONLY COMPARED WITH GODFATHER, but the difference that ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is too DARK."
dodo_41181,"Aug 16, 2018",10/10,"Is the film too long? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that it takes real concentration to understand Leone's story construction, in which everything may or may not be an opium dream, a nightmare, a memory, or a flashback, and that we have to keep track of characters and relationships over fifty years. No, in the sense that the movie is compulsively and continuously watchable and that the audience did not stir or grow restless as the epic unfolded."""
mifamily6,"Jan 9, 2004",10/10,Nothing more to be said than that ONCE UPON A TIME IN AMERICA is the best long movie I have ever seen and I have seen a lot of movies.  Sergio Leone is the best director that ever lived and the saddest to go.10/10
