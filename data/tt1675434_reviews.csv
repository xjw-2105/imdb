bakor24-1,"Dec 28, 2011",9/10,"It has been 9 weeks now since Intoucblaes has come to the movie theaters. I did not give it much thought at first, but the universal acclaim I have heard convinced me to go see it. I don't over-stating the universality of the acclaim, people of various races, classes, colors & countries told me it was a must see. I had no expectations, and I was floored.Intouchables, directed by Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache, starring Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy is possibly the best French movie of the year. This is not because of a lack of worthy contenders, but truly because Intouchables is that profound. It touches on themes of presumptions, social class difference, health, and as naïve as it may sound, the universality of humanity.The story is not as important as is the relationship that is displayed between the two protagonists. Philippe (played by Cluzet) a rich aristocrat that loves adrenaline rushes finds himself a paraplegic after a paragliding incident. Driss (played by Sy) is, in appearance a typical hoodlum from the ghetto. The two are brought together and wonders happen.The audience then sees how the men affect one another as they engage in a truly honest relationship. Driss is charismatic, lighthearted and funny, helping make Philippe's life enjoyable again. In the process the traditionally cold French aristocracy around Philippe warms up and lightens. He is like a hot knife through cold butter.Again, it is not so much the story that is important as is the social commentary. The commentary is not judgmental and is very subtle, revealed only in the contrasts the director chose in the story and its contexts. His method reminded me of a sort of Zen approach to comedy. One example you can catch from the trailer alone is the contrast between the able bodied black Driss and t the crippled white man, etc.The audience is also given wonderful sights of Paris and France as we go through the Pyrenees, Cabourg and the various streets of Paris.On paper the review does not make the movie justice. It is hilarious in a way that is true, honest and by which anyone can relate to. Most importantly it is revealing and comforting in its reminder of the essential in life : love. It's approach is simple, pure and honest and that makes it worthy of the title of ""best movie of the year"".I cannot say more; the film must be experienced. My friends tried, they failed, so I trusted them and I saw it. It floored me. Go and be floored.PS - I heard American studios have purchased the rights for the film. They will need a brilliant director, screenwriters and perfect actors to make the original justice in the way ""The Departed"" did for ""Infernal Affairs""."
bipbip2222,"Nov 25, 2011",9/10,"This movie surprised us. We checked on IMDb and saw 8/10 for a french movie, without hesitation we went to the movie theatre to watch the movie.The subject is hard but the movie is really funny. In a few seconds you are fully projected within the film from the beginning to the end. There is no special effet but the actors are playing very well and the movie is based on a real story.If you are skeptical for French movie don't be for this one ... it is a must see movie.Enjoy the movie."
vincent_spano,"Oct 19, 2011",8/10,"I have seen this movie tonight at a preview session as the official french national release is set on 2011, November 2nd. Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakashe, accompanied by the lead actor Omar Sy were meeting the audience and cheerfully answering questions.The movie is very well written. Although opening on a flash-forward, it is fairly classic comedy about the meeting of two opposite people who were very unlikely to meet. The first one is a paraplegic white middle aged very rich and lonely man, the other one is a young black, poor, unemployed, coming from poor suburbs and a very large family.What makes the quality of the film, beside the humour present in every scene in which Omar Sy appears (actually most of the film), is the emotion you can feel, through increasingly attaching characters.The story is based upon a true story, and real characters.If you want to watch and enjoyable comedy, with very touching moments, this is a must go.There are interesting insights about arts as well (paintings, classical music, and funk music). What is art? What is its use?"
OttoVonB,"Nov 27, 2011",10/10,"Do not look at this through the prism of ""Foreign Films"". You'd be wasting your time and miss something far too important.Hollywood does scale like nobody else, leaving the competition gasping in its wake. France does intimacy, and brutality. Nothing is sacred. And rather than try to revive the New Wave or emulate Hollywood like most widely seen French films of late, ""Intouchables"" harnesses its core strengths - ease with intimacy, willingness to ridicule anything and brutal honesty - and delivers one of the funniest, most honest and touching films I have ever seen.Sy is a failed robber, going through the motions and playing the stereotypical jobless émigré. Cluzet is a romantic and melancholy mind trapped in a useless body. The circumstances that bring them together are too funny to spoil here, but meet they do, and an awkward relationship quickly blossoms as they bring out the best in each other.The film's simplicity is delightfully misleading: the script is a masterpiece of comedy writing, and however good the rest of the cast is, the central duo is magical. Sy's comic timing will have you in stitches, but it is his honesty and vulnerability that make you fall in love with the character. Cluzet isn't your typical sad-sack, instead, much of the finest pleasures in the film consist in watching him use his keen mind to mess with the world around him (a subplot about an abstract painting really takes the biscuit, you'll know it when you see it).This is one of the most unique, beautiful and honest friendships ever committed to film. It will make you laugh, it will make you cry... a delightful celebration of everything in life that makes it worthwhile."
n-buenning,"Jan 10, 2012",10/10,"I am now trying to find words to describe this movie for an hour. I couldn't.You've seen it, or you haven't. It's monumental and outrageously good.The cast is brilliant. The jokes lovely. The story and the idea behind the movie is beautiful. Especially when you've worked/lived with handicapped people. The music is such a perfect choice, it is unbelievable.I hope this movie makes a plenty of people think about how good their life is and how bad it could have been.Bottom line: Oscar-worthy. Period."
ElMaruecan82,"Jan 17, 2012",10/10,"In less than two months, ""Untouchable"" became the second most successful French film by number of spectators, such an event by itself that people went then to see it, not because they thought it was good but to see what was so good in it: that's the virtual circle of success.My biggest disappointment in 2011 was with ""The Tree of Life"", a movie I sincerely wanted to love but couldn't, and I left the theater before it ended with a bitter taste of frustration. Proportionally, my greatest positive surprise came with ""Untouchable"" because it was the opposite expectation: I was sure I would dislike it, figuring the movie manipulated viewers through the overused device of the improbable friendship. Why such preconceived negativity? Well, when a young black guy from French suburbs, darkly depicted in Mathieu Kassovitz 'Hate' and infamous for its occasional riots, befriends a rich quadriplegic, I immediately think of 'good feelings', 'mainstream populism'  unaware that I apply to myself a cynical judgment that can undermine my very way to enjoy not just this film, but any film. After all, why getting ready for hatred when it's so relieving to give the benefit of the doubt and get ready for appreciation? Especially since more than 15 millions of French people, from different ages and backgrounds liked it.So, I saw it  and loved it.The story of ""Untouchable"" is the kind of unintentional masterpiece that only movies can provide every once in a while, it has no other pretension than to depict a magnificent and inspiring friendship story starting as a simple job. A young man with a Senegalese background, Omar Sy as Driss, only needs a signature to prove that he attended an interview for a live-in carer job. For some strange reason, Paul, the rich man, played by a wonderful François Cluzet, gives him the job, with a one-month trial period. The reason of this choice is smoothly handled by the script: the film starts with all the job applicants, every one of them unnaturally posing and getting mixed in prepared answers. Then, Driss casually enters, without waiting for his turn or knocking on the door, he's got enough problems to deal with, unemployment, an experience in jail, being a pariah for society, and undesirable even in his own family, especially her adoptive aunt. Driss' attitude pleases Paul, because after his paragliding accident, he can't feel his body from neck to toes, and needs caring almost 24 hours per days and 7 days per week, so he really doesn't have time for bullshit either.And this is a remarkable aspect in the script written by the two directors Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache: it doesn't waste time cementing the friendship, the two leads rapidly get fond of each other, a feeling illustrated in the poster with both posing with natural smiles. The film shows Omar's struggle to learn how 'needy' Paul is, which provides some priceless comedic moments, but ""Untouchable"" goes immediately to the core, an eye-opening message about the life endured by a handicapped person, making all the wealth in the world pointless and the richness of heart and mind, priceless. Through Driss and Paul's interaction, the film explores the real needs of people in life, respect and understanding, acceptance and love. Maybe if it was handled by other directors, it would have been predictable but in ""Untouchable"", the complicity between the two heroes feels absolutely real. There's one scene when Driss shave the bushy beard of Paul, well, I won't spoil it for you, but the part was a clever mix of realism and comedy because anyone would have done what Driss did at one moment, and that's the secret of the film: it feels real.Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances, in ""Untouchable"", it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. And I don't get the complaints: why they didn't respect the original story where the carer was an Arab, or how they 'sugarcoated' the handicap? I even heard that in America, they were accusing the film of racism because Driss was portrayed as a sort of (I quote) 'helper monkey'? Seriously, this is getting old The way handicap is approached never flirts with an exaggerated pathos, nor the opposite, which is the most intelligent achievement. There's a sort of heart's intelligence in the way Omar teases Cluzet with his own handicap, and the film provides the extraordinary message that pleasure and thrills have unlimited media, whether they come from pot, an ear-massage or even paragliding.Many of Paul's friends criticizes the presence of Driss in Paul's life, but Paul doesn't care: Omar is a man full of life, big, tall and strong, and when he uses violence to teach a man the respect of a parking sign, Paul admits this is the right method. Both are in the same wavelength. I wondered if the title ""Untouchable"" referred to the lowest caste in India, echoing the two men's conditions, both outcasts physically and socially, but I guess, their relationship evolves into a friendship precisely because they're both strong-minded, and together, they become even stronger, until getting untouchables ... in the noblest meaning of the word.There are real people in ""Untouchable"", nothing works as plot devices even if some situations are so cinematically appealing: Omar inviting everybody to dance during Paul's birthday, his learning of the aristocratic world, the art of abstract painting, and the way he breaks the conventions with an unconventional charisma reaches a level of energetic comedy that reminds of the greatest days of Eddie Murphy, with Cluzet as a perfect straight-man not deprived from a sense of humor. ""Untouchable"" is simply an inspiring story of friendship with whatever defines this beautiful virtue.And yes, it's one of the best French films ever, and certainly one of the best of 2011."
fionadliliane-cross,"Nov 14, 2011",N/A,"Being french and a film maker myself, I have high standards for ratings, and this one definitely deserves in 10/10. I've not seen a film showing our world with such humour in a long time. The jokes are absurd and possibly, with a touch of British humour to them. The directing is beautiful, the acting is incredible, the shots are somehow truthful, if I can say that about a shot. It may be Omar Sy's first time in a leading role, for a major production, but he really delivered, and not just in the funny parts, the delivery of emotions was just spotless. Francois Cluzet was also just as brilliant, as he usually is. I will be recommending this film to everyone, and seriously hoping it will be released in the UK soon enough for me to see it again! Only negative aspect... the Americans are thinking of doing a remake... why do they always have to? I mean would you reconsider remaking the ""Joconde"" or the Sixtine Chapel to American standards? Film is an art like any other, it travels the world as it is... no need for remakes..."
jo_steins,"Nov 20, 2011",10/10,"Well, I've just got out of the theater and i must say that all the reviews are right. this is an amazing film! The actors are simply the best, Omar is not only a great comic but also a great actor.The filming has a certain touch that brings to mind ""What's Eating Gilbert Grape"" in the way the director was able to capture not only the suffering of Phillip but also the joy.Not wanting to spoil the film for others, i highly recommend seeing this in the theaters and with a loved one.It is also a good film for teenagers as it holds a few wonderful life lessons.Enjoy."
temudjin82,"Jan 7, 2012",10/10,"Just seen last night, amazing movie, great performances from actors, particularly from Omar, and Cluzet is great as usual. Photography of images are great, supported by good choice of locations supporting actors are all good and natural so doing a great job to give a great solid base to the story. RIch of emotions on a simple story where ordinary people become extraordinary. Good representation of social differences in France without being too heavy on it. Simple, beautiful, efficient, like a good French cuisine, making a great dish full of tastes magically mixed :) Most to be watched and even more emotional when you know its based on true story !"
jvdesuit1,"Dec 11, 2011",10/10,"It's not because I'm French that I appreciated this movie which I've seen twice. Too give the really infamous appreciation of the reader from Toronto to the French public, qualifying us of a segregationist country is difficult to gulp especially coming from north America which has not a very glorious past on the matter even in recent years. Perhaps the commentator should see the movie ""The help"" to refresh his memory... But what I'd like to say here apart of praising the fabulous interpretation of both leading actors is to remind that this is a true story, it did not come out from the directors and scriptwriter heads.Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo born in 51, got a dramatic para-glider accident in the French Alps in 1993 being totally deprived of movements from the base of his neck to the tip of his feet. 3 Years later his wife died and he was helped out of his depression by Abdel Sellou his life-aid assistant. He published his terrible story in 2001 under the title ""the second breath"" (in French ""Le second soufflé""). The directors have had the compliments of Di Borgo for the way they adapted his story. If in any way this was biased he would never had accepted the film to be left in that state. The Di Borgo family is a very old and wealthy family whose origins goes far back in the history of France, and their residence in Paris is considered to be one the jewels of the capital at the same level as The Hotel de Sully in Paris. What is shown in the film is exactly what happens everywhere in the world as far as handicapped are concerned: tendency to overwhelm them with pity which is more diminishing them as if their fate is not enough for them to swallow every minute or second each day. The way the racial problem is viewed is properly demonstrated. The police behaves in different ways depending of the color of your skin or your country's origin and sorry to say North America is a very good example of this so perhaps is not a proper judge on this matter.The authors had the courage to state this straightforwardly. The film shows on the contrary how a man with a very limited education at the beginning, a former convict, is capable progressively to change his views, and find in himself at the same time the good Samaritan aspects and help with humor and punch, his handicapped boss to find a new belief in his shattered life at 42! At the same time the boss demonstrates an open-mindedness which was not obvious to get not only because of his handicap but because of his origins and his wealth at first. Let's not illusion ourselves on the matter, everywhere in the world few wealthy people would accept to have as an aid an ex convict whichever color his skin should be! It's a fantastic lesson of tolerance, and friendship. For just those reason this movie would deserve an Oscar or Golden Globe awards.09/07/2013 : I've just seen that under ""Crazy credits"" is mentioned that 5% of the revenues of the film will go to an institutions caring for disabled persons. I just don't see what's crazy about that! I find this kind of remark particularly shocking and insulting both for the producers and the actors especially in this case where the story told is a true one.I suggest the administrator to delete that remark or change its qualification."
schwoni,"Feb 21, 2012",10/10,"I CANNOT BELIEVE that ""Bridesmaids"" is nominated for an Oscar, just like Brad Pitt for his completely boring and not convincing part in ""Moneyball"", when in 2011 such a great movie was made!!! Did the Academy even see this?It's a shame and in my opinion proves that the ""Academy Awards"" are just ridiculous and have nothing to do with good film and acting.Francois Cluzet's performance is outstanding, as is Omar Sy and the story is just lovely and touching in a wonderful non-Hollywood way. (REMAKE? ARE YOU KIDDING ME?)Spread the word and enjoy this beautiful movie!!!"
jessie-39,"Jun 3, 2012",10/10,"This is one of the best movies we have ever seen. My wife and I see 3 movies a week on average over The past 40 years. Saying it is one of the best is quite a statement. This French movie with sub titles is simply Spectacular. The storyline involves a man crippled in An accident, his wife has passed away and he cannot Find adequate help which he requires 24/7. Until he meets the Most unlikely of people to care for him. The acting by Omar Sy & Mr. Cluzet Is the very best. The movie has everything you want in a Movie. It has compassion and is spectacularly Funny. Run to see this movie. The two prime Actors must be recognized for a whole host Of awards. Wow!"
rightwingisevil,"Apr 2, 2012",N/A,"wow, what a wonderful movie!! full of love, friendship and laughs. just like i always said, when a french movie is good, it's not just good, it's great! and this movie simply explains it. no wonder this movie would have won some international awards, it really deserved it. with these two great actors of two generation, the performances of both is just a perfect casting job. this is an absolutely feeling-good movie, warm up your heart without any intention. in this movie, you will see how it's like day and night that the extreme poverty of the immigrant families and the extreme prosperity of the french rich people. by contrast, this movie used it to prove that oil and water could have mixed together and evolved into a very heartfelt social structure.i enjoyed it 100%."
RoshanJG,"Mar 27, 2012",10/10,"Intouchables is a true story of Philippe ,a rich aristocrat who is paralyzed from neck down and Driss ,an unemployed man coming from a poverty stricken family..Francois & Omar as the lead cast give a superb performance .. The charismatic Omar (Driss) is just amazing..His very presence on screen is powerful as he juggles between rib-tickling comedy and some serious drama...Francois (Philippe) is on par with Omar...He gives a very controlled performance and is able to hold strong against Omar's contrasting character.Considering,Francois had to act as a quadriplegic, he has done an amazing job..His expressions itself substitute any needs of dialogues.. The bond the two develop is pure gem.Story is smooth and never drags..It could have been an intense drama movie,but the directors usage of comedy made it stand out from other similar stories..Direction is sharp & the movie doesn't rely on any over the top scenes..The music is beautifully blended into the movie and it enhances the effectiveness of many scenes...The Intouchables can be described by one word..Beautiful...The movie is a must watch for all..Acting- 5/5 Story- 5/5 Direction- 5/5 Comedy- 5/5 Drama- 5/5"
claudio_carvalho,"Jan 10, 2013",9/10,"In Paris, the aristocratic and intellectual Philippe (François Cluzet) is a quadriplegic millionaire that is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his red-haired secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Phillipe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance.Philippe challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Phillipe and his employees. ""Intouchables"" is a beautiful and uplifting story of friendship based on a true story. My daughter had watched this movie a couple of months ago when she was traveling on vacation and recommended it a lot to me and yesterday I saw it on DVD.The screenplay is excellent and the directors and writers Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have a magnificent work. This theme in the hands of a weak director could transform the uplifting story into a corny or melodramatic movie. But they succeeded making a funny and touching comedy.The cast is also fantastic, and the chemistry between François Cluzet and Omar Sy is amazing. Anne Le Ny is also wonderful and Audrey Fleurot is a very beautiful woman and excellent actress in her ambiguous role luring Driss. In the end, I went to bed late but feeling good. My vote is nine.Title (Brazil): ""Intocáveis (""Untouchables"")"
mau-zi,"Feb 6, 2012",9/10,"This was for sure one of the Top5 or Top10 movies I've ever seen. The actors, the ambiente, the story ... simply everything was in a perfect combination. This film is for me in a league with films like ""The Elephant Man"", but for a much wider audience. And as the title say, after this film I really have to consider to reduce my ratings for several films, because it seems a bit unfair to put them on the same level as this film, although I don't have anything to criticize on them at all. All the persons in the film are very authentic played. And both main characters surprised me with a brilliant performance. I would say, that both actors are really what they are playing in the film. If I would see François Cluzet in the street, I would be surprised not seeing him in a wheelchair. The emotions shown in the last sequence of the film are so brilliant."
Hellmant,"Jan 17, 2013",7/10,"'THE INTOUCHABLES': Three and a Half Stars (Out of Five)A French comedy-drama film that has become the third biggest foreign film and biggest foreign language film of all time. It's also received rave reviews and a great deal of award recognition, but no 2012 Academy Award nomination (due to the fact that the foreign language division was afraid it would win). The film is beloved the world over but perhaps just a little over-hyped. It's a good movie but it is clichéd and somewhat simple and unoriginal. It's been criticized for being another tale that revolves around rich white people being enlightened and finding happiness through poor black people. It does seem like the type of movie Eddie Murphy might have starred in in the 80s, perhaps with Dustin Hoffman (because the lead white actor in the film bares a striking resemblance to Dustin Hoffman).The film stars Francois Cluzet as an aristocrat, named Philippe, who was paralyzed in a paragliding accident. He's somewhat depressed and has lost most communication with his adopted daughter Elisa (Alba Gaia Kraghede Bellugi). He also has phantom pains which keep him up at night and still mourns the death of his wife greatly, who died before they could have any kids of their own. He maintains romantic relationships with women only through written letters and fears actually meeting or speaking with them. One day he's looking for a new caretaker and a man named Driss (Omar Sy) enters his home just looking for a signature so he can continue to collect welfare checks. Driss lives with his large family in a small flat in a Parisian suburb. So when Philippe actually does offer him a job as well as a room in his mansion, that has it's own large bathtub in it, it's quite a culture shock for him. Of course Philippe is inspired by Driss and both men's lives are forever changed.The film was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. It is nicely directed and looks beautiful. It also has a nice combination of both comedy and drama and both elements are done well. It's just that the film isn't that funny or that emotionally moving. The performances are fine, it has some good laughs and it's a good well intentioned story but it's nothing we haven't seen before and far from anything spectacular. It's enormous success does puzzle me a little but I'd much rather see a movie like this do really well than something like 'TWILIGHT'. So it's definitely a decent crowd-pleasing film, just not a great one.Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OcoZRlVFMzA"
kosmasp,"Apr 3, 2012",9/10,"A comedy like that is tough to master. Balancing the funny and the dramatic stuff and still keep enough character development inside. And while I wouldn't say that both characters really redeem themselves (wholly), it gives them nice touches. Touches that include quite a lot of non-PC behavior (be alert and do not watch, if you are sensible to that sort of thing).It is a french comedy with heart. And it was a sleeper hit in Germany. Word of mouth made this a big success. A bit of credit has to go to the people who dubbed it I guess (I watched the original version with subtitles), because they must have done a phenomenal job. It is not perfect, but that fact makes it even weirder and more adorable"
jonsefcik,"Nov 4, 2018",6/10,"I feel like I need to say something. Not only is this in the IMDb top 250, its very close to the top, sitting at #38. This means its higher than Das Boot, The Shining, The Pianist, and more than 80% of the other incredible films on this list. I don't think every movie in the top 250 is a masterpiece, but most of the ones I've seen attain a certain level of quality that sets them apart from your ""average"" movie. I rented this movie hoping it would at least be good, but I didn't even get that.There's not much to say other than every aspect was competently done but nothing exceptional (that goes for the story, performances, production value, and direction). My only real complaint would be that our two leads are a bit one dimensional. Why are rich people always stereotyped as loving classical music and listening to nothing else? Driss is a bit too erratic and clueless to be believable, but that's just me.Clearly I'm missing something because everyone seems to love this movie. If you want to check it out, I won't stop you. It's put together well enough to be enjoyed, but for me personally it left little impact, and I can think of literally hundreds of films more deserving of such a high spot on this list. I give it a 6/10, and a generous 6 at that."
willwoodmill,"Apr 19, 2016",2/10,"One of the most wonderful things about the art of filmmaking is that it is incredibly good at getting an emotional response from the people that consume it. Now that was a really pretentious way of saying that films are great because they can make use feel happy, sad, scared, etc. I know for me personally that a lot of my favorite films are the ones that are able to make me cry. And I think that we can all agree that it is truly a wonderful thing when a film is made with such devotion and passion that it is able to make its audience shed tears over fictional characters and events.Unfortunately filmmakers know that audiences love when a film makes them cry, and some filmmakers will try and take advantage of that fact. They will make films that are filled with overdone clichés and over dramatized acting/dialogue in hopes of making the audience cry, because if you can get someone to cry at your film it's very unlikely that they will forget it, and they will probably like it. This is exactly the sort of film the Intouchables is, a cheap, insincere, artificial cluster of scenes that will do whatever is necessary to make the audience get emotional. These cheap films that target and exploit sensitive topics just so they can receive acclaim and attention, are in my opinion some of the worst films out there. They represent all of the worst aspects in filmmaking, and deserve to be called out for what they are, and they are detestable piles of complete s***.I'm entering my third paragraph and I haven't even mentioned the acting, plot, cinematography or really any of the actual specifics of the film yet, and that's because regardless of whether you've seen it or not you can already predict everything that happens in the entire film. The plot is so structured and formulaic that it feels like it was copied and pasted from a text-book. The cinematography is at best dull, and at other times so bad I actually can not believe it was in a film with a 9.5 million euro budget. (which comes out to roughly 10.8 million dollars.) All of the actors give exactly what you'd expect from a movie like The Intouchables, and honestly I can't even remember a thing about any of there performances. Which is a compliment for a movie like The Intouchables.The Intouchables received mixed reviews from critics, and was nominated for best foreign language films by the Golden Globes. Even though critics were split on the films quality, general audiences loved it. At the time of writing this review it is the 38th highest rated movie on IMDb, coming ahead of films like Apocalypse Now, 2001: A Space Odyssey, The Seventh Seal, Ikiru, Vertigo, and even Citizen Kane. And I won't lie this upsets me, at least more than it should. The idea of a film as terrible as The Intouchables coming ahead films like the ones previously mentioned, (not to mention the dozens of other better ones in the top 250, and hundreds out of it.) just really destroys my faith in the film industry. I can not recommend that anyone watch this film ever. But even though I've been basically calling this film an indefensible offense on cinema. There are things out there that are much worse than it, so I won't give it the lowest rating possible.2.1/10"
karlo_v,"May 2, 2012",9/10,"This movie does not really need another review, but after seeing what Daily Beast's (Marlow Stern) and Variety's (Jay Weissberg) critics have written about it, I feel that one thing needs a serious clarification. It is somewhat disturbing and, at the same time, really telling a lot about USA's culture that American reviewers see this movie as ""race-relations"" feature.I've read all of the 38 reviews written here on IMDb until now and I would suggest to both Stern and Weissberg to do the same. Maybe they could learn something. Most of the reviews here were written by non-Americans and, tellingly, most of them do not even mention race or race relations or anything similar. To me that shows how deep anything to do with a difference in color of skin has been intertwined with USA culture when even in this film - where nobody from, let's say the rest of the world, does not see any racism or anything similar - the only thing USA critics do see is the difference in color of skin. Sad, very sad.I'm, therefore, afraid that, if it shares Stern's and Weissberg's opinions, most of the USA audience will not see the real beauty of this film and will, probably also under the influence of critics' reviews, see the movie as a race-relations feature when that's the only thing it's not.And what it is? It is (I can't believe I'm gonna write this) a carefree comedy about a quadriplegic and his personal aide. The movie does not at any moment come even close to apathy or pathetics which is a success on its own. The movie also has just about the perfect amount of black humor and political incorrectness and does not cross those borders at any time. I think this is the only movie about a disabled human where, after seeing it, you will go out of the theater laughing. And I can't remember any movie which approaches such a difficult theme with such ease.Additionaly, the soundtrack - both Einaudi's score as well as selected tracks - is fantastic.A lot has been written here about cast and I would just like to add that along masterful performances of both Sy and Cluzet, the rest of the actors are equally great, especially Anne Le Ny and Audrey Flerot."
dii_rajneesh,"Jul 24, 2012",10/10,"My my where do I begin.To start with I did not want the movie to end at all. Its becoming more and more rare for movies as this one to come by. This movie completes the circle, as far as movie going experience goes. The movie has left me with a sort of warm feeling in my heart that cannot be said in words alone. There is something about the way French movies are made, when they get it right they are simply par excellence. Hollywood kisses concrete.Anyway, I feel most of us humans are quadriplegic though not physically but emotionally in someway or other. But what one may agree is that when you cry you cry alone, but when you laugh the whole world laughs with you.If just by the word ""quadriplegic"" you are expecting it to be a dark, heart shattering, emotionally overloaded movie then I would passionately defend against such a prejudiced opinion. One is not the physical form alone. One can have a beautiful body but a black heart and vice-verse.A very well written, full bodied script and an exceptionally well directed movie. Characters cannot become more real than this on the silver screen. Omar Sy in my opinion has done a very good job. He lived his character and not played it. To contrast him we have François Cluzet who kept the sparks flying. Omar Sy's comments on Bach, Vivaldi etc classics had me in splits. And also do not miss out on the singing Human tree, the very mentioning of which is having me in splits.Wow !!! that was some movie. Go get this movie guys and see it today, no now."
criirsara2000,"Mar 23, 2012",10/10,"I love French movies, so different from typical Hollywood stuff full of special effects but often with lack of depth in stories.This movies is so simple, humane, deep. It's about what should happen more often, great friendship between two so different persons who are able to go beyond prejudices and stereotypes. It's not a sad movie at all, like it could sound to some people, and it's absolutely not racist like I have read somewhere else in the comments. I suggest to all people to go and watch this, you will go out of the cinema with something great you have learned and seen. It's definitely the best movies I have seen this year so far."
TrusTinsanity,"Sep 20, 2024",9/10,"The fact that this has a 57 on Metacritic is insane to me. Who knew that having very weighted reviews was a bad idea. I went into The Intouchables with low expectations because I thought it wasn't my type of film but it's obectively great for pretty much every demographic.Also, the real life Philippe died last year in 2023 Jun. Abdel (Driss in the film) is currently alive and is 53 year old.In a nutshell, a very rich man gets paralyzed from the neck down and needs to hire a caretaker. He chooses Abdel because he doesn't give him special treatment and is more of a friend to him than a caretaker. Over the course of the film they become friends.10/10."

He is absolutely a great actor.Great comedy. Great story. Great sequence. Great music. Great acting. Great fellings.Great film.This film overwhelmed me if it's the GOAT movie or the second.
yellowgixxer750,"May 17, 2023",10/10,"I watched this film as part of my French degree course. I didn't want to - I'm tired, I have too much work with my day job and I'm not motivated.Well I am now. It's 0300 and I'm buzzing.This film is wonderful. The first 30 seconds had me hooked. The dialogue is fantastic, the acting is astonishing, the acting is sublime. The story has exactly the right amount of humour, pathos, conflict and social commentary. Very subtle social commentary - Disney could learn a lot from this film in how to get a message across without resorting to shmaltz.Oh, the cinematography. That alone deserves an oscar. Not a single duff shot, and a lot of jaw-dropping wonderfulness.Ultimately this is a love story, but not like that. It's a rite of passage story, but not like that. It's a story of redemption. But, um, not like that. It's a story that you can't help feeling good about at the end.And isn't that what makes a truly great film?"
rangdetumpy,"Jul 20, 2012",N/A,"This is the story of friendship between a quadriplegic (Phillipe) and his black attendant (Driss). At the surface one has the impression that the film will be a tearjerker with oodles of sentimental scenes coming one after another. Being from India and having witnessed such films of dying person or disability which are meant to titillate the sentiment of the weak to my mind I perceived one that of a contrived, loud, excessively melodramatic ""Gujarish"" which was also about a quadriplegic person. But as I started watching it how I wished to see such a film being made in India. The movie is a lesson to live life with full vigour amidst adversities. The film starts with two persons in car with one in the wheel driving it crazily through the busy roads of France when they are stopped by the police. Driss challenges Philippe that the policemen wouldn't arrest him but on the contrary would escort them. Thus they put a bet of 200Euros.Driss faked a drama about how he was taking quadriplegic Philippe to hospital for emergency and thus he had no option but to opt for rash driving. They succeeded in creating guilt amongst the policemen thus assuring them to escort Phillipe's car. As they start the car again there is an immediate smile in my face that this will be film full of life. From there the movie goes back to where the hiring process is on for a caretaker. Driss, an outlaw leaving in the black community of suburbs took the job. Unlike the other caretakers Philippe become connected to Driss easily because of the Driss's lack of sympathy towards him. In fact the film works at this level which makes us feel that people with certain problem needs affection rather than sympathy. Driss is an outlaw, rude and brutally honest and somehow there seem to be a connection with Phillipe who is a rich loner losing his lower half to an accident. The zeal for life is still there but the support is missing. From having food to shower to everything he needs someone else's ""hands"" not out of sympathy but out of compassion and he found it in Driss. Driss on the other hand learns the art of living from Phil's quadriplegic existence. He learns to respect life, family and more than that Himself. He gains confidence in life and tries to induce that to Phillipe by trying to re-marry him to his lady love. The climax is one of the best I have seen in recent times. It is honest, sweet, touching yet there is no forced melodrama. The simplicity brings down tears of happiness as we learn the real characters that inspired the reel version are living a happy contended life overcoming their individual short comings at physical as well as psychological level. There have been several films on friendship between a black and white but there is nothing contrived in the plot. Director duo Olivier Nakache & Eric Toledano's intention is as pure as the friendship portrayed.Their success lies in their usage of subtle humour to tell this touching story.The wide angle of camera reflects a contentment which the protagonist is having with his surroundings. The gradual bonding has been kept subtle with small sequences like Driss taking Phillipe to open air around 3am and then offering cigarette. These are the small things which help in taking the bigger step. The usage of light has been apt as the shade gradually shifts towards brighter shade. Dorian's editing gels with the character transformations. The long cuts in the initial reels changed to short cuts reflecting the happiness and youthful exuberance within. Ludovico's soft background score suits the mood of the film. The occasional use of orchestra uplifts the mood after prolonged calmness which fits Phillipe's characterization. François Cluzet and Omar Sy as Phillipe and Driss respectively are flawless. Veteran actor Cluzet fits in perfectly as Phillipe and brings out the hopelessness yet the desire to live with perfect conviction. The clumsiness of a quadriplegic comes from his mannerism. And then there is the young talent Sy whose comic timings are more than perfect. His range of expression helps in showing the change in the curve of his character as he softens down on his basic mannerisms. His initial mockery to the aristocratic existence, to his understanding of their behaviour and thus a change in his own expressions are put across with perfection. ""Intouchables"" celebrates life and the reason it works is one can identify with the basic emotion. Someway we all are saddled in our existence fighting all odds and struggling to overcome adversities of life. This film brings in hope; it throws light to the darkness in our existence. It teaches us to love through tales of true friendship, a virtue that is losing its value in this materialistic existence. It tells us to believe in our strength and never lose hope which we tend to even in minor setbacks. Without trying to sympathise on bygones the film subtly teaches to look forward and use every precious moment of our life to be happy. The movie is a must watch for everyone who can breathe.P.S : This year a great tragedy happened in my life for which I was mentally down. But this movie really helped me to have faith in life and all to a certain extend. I really want to thanks the director duo for making this film"
ddelamaide,"Apr 29, 2013",6/10,"The actors give good performances here but the script, and the movie, ultimately is ridden with clichés and not terribly sympathetic. Anyone paralyzed in this manner deserves sympathy, but if you have a vast fortune, an army of caretakers, and every imaginable comfort and resource you may need less sympathy than some others. Why did the filmmakers transform a North African (Muslim?) caretaker into a Senegalese? Why is this black African's conformity to every cliché -- pot-smoking, violent, rap music, he even dances well -- supposed to be refreshing, either to Philippe or the viewer? So much was simply artificial -- dressing Philippe like a doll, playing with his beard and hair, the caricature of the other applicants, the behavior of the adopted daughter -- or further clichés -- e.g. the police. Mildly amusing at times, way too long, just watchable."
Maheegan,"Dec 6, 2020",9/10,"You are,Brilliant movie, absolutely brilliant.
Best I have seen in a long time."
david-meldrum,"Dec 30, 2014",6/10,"A French-language based on a true story drama, The Intouchables is ... touching ... but not as good as it likes to think it is. In the mind of its creators it seems to be a comic drama of immense human significance; in reality it is powerful and affecting and funny at different times. It's also clichéd, patronising and predictable.It's the story of a rich, privileged quadriplegic man who needs to hire a new carer. He picks a young man with no qualifications and no experience from the Paris housing projects. What follows is a predictable but still effective clash of cultures and expectations, with mutual learning taking place on both sides of the divide. The films seems at pains to not offend with its sensitive subject matter, the overall effect seeming to be at times patronising to the poor and the disabled alike. All poor people like hip-hop, it seems; all the rich, classical music. The quadriplegic man struggles to feel, you see. Yes, really. All a bit trite at times.At others is affecting though. It chimed with me at points; it encourages an engaging, counter- cultural lack of safety and wisdom the better to actually build meaningful lives and relationships, to break artificial barriers and self-limitations. It's encourages a kind of holy recklessness on its viewers, that you suspect will get lost amidst the worthiness for many. If only the film itself had shown a little more danger and a little less safety, we could have had something more special and less crowd-pleasing."
Boba_Fett1138,"May 31, 2012",9/10,"This movie so easily could had become a forced and melodramatic one but luckily it's one that got made with lots of tact and skill, making this one fine drama, with a comical touch to it as well.Guess that I really like contrasts in movies. The two main characters are complete opposites of each other, in about every way imaginable. Driss is poor, Philippe is rich. Driss is vibrant, Philippe is a quadriplegic. Driss is black, Philippe is white, etcetera. They are a complete mismatch on paper but yet they become best friends, which forms the central point of this movie and works out so well because it gets made believable.They don't just become good friends, they also learn from each other and I believe that they also become better persons because of that. This is were the movie its warmth and soul comes from, in my opinion.It doesn't ever dwell on it that Philippe is bound to a wheelchair and can only move his head, or that Driss is poor and also has a poor relationship with this family. If anything, this movie is a celebration of life, rather than than a movie that will bring you down. The effect of these sort of movies often is that it actually strengthens its drama because you feel far more involved with it, also since the movie doesn't shoves its drama down your throat constantly.There are some small side-plots in the movie but the good news about them is that they don't distract from the main theme and storyline of the movie and the movie never puts its emphasis too much on any of the side-plots or its secondary characters. It keeps a great and effective focus on its main subject, throughout pretty much the entire film.It's a great movie, in every way. It has a good look to it, that isn't cheap or rushed. It's a respectful and professionally made movie, which all paid off for it.Also the acting is just great. Everybody seems perfectly cast in their roles and know how to handle their characters and manage to fit within the style and tone of the overall movie. Of course François Cluzet and Omar Sy carry most of the movie and they did a more than great job with this.It's just a movie I can't say anything bad or negative about. It's well made and effective, which makes this one of the better genre movies out there!9/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
planktonrules,"Mar 17, 2013",8/10,"According to IMDb, ""The Intouchables"" set all sorts of box office records--the second most successful French film in history in France as well as the number one film for 2012 in Germany. So, because of this very impressive pedigree I was perhaps expecting a little more. Now this is NOT to say it's a bad film--it's wonderful. It just didn't seem quite THAT wonderful. But it IS well worth seeing.As for the plot, this movie is a true-life account of a quadriplegic man (François Cluzet) in search of a new aide. However, all the folks who apply for the job seem the same--boring and sterile. On an odd lark, he chooses an unqualified man who doesn't seem interested in the job at all (Omar Sy). And, oddly, they form a friendship that seems to reinforce the old adage that opposites attract.While the plot is amazingly thin and seems to be missing chunks of the story, the film is masterful in several ways. The acting (particularly by Sy) is just terrific. But even more terrific is the artistry of the film itself. It takes a somewhat ordinary story and injects it with class--including some wonderful cinematography and one of the nicest soundtracks I have ever heard. It is a lovely film."
yris2002,"Mar 18, 2012",8/10,"It's quite rare to find and have the pleasure to enjoy a genuine movie, blending comedy and drama with such naturalness: that's why ""Intouchables"" is undoubtedly a rare authentic picture and the fact that the story is inspired by a true one helped make the movie more involving. Funny and touching at the same time, the picture evolves with simplicity but strong pathos, with the merit of avoiding every pathetic or melodramatic attitude: there's brutal honesty in representing the real condition of Philippe, as well as Driss's initial uncompassionate attitude. There are touching moments, there are true amusing moments, both accompanied by a forceful soundtrack. Acting proves brilliant, to say the least, and the pairing between Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy sparkles and captures the viewer's attention. I was swept away by Dryss's genuine smile as well as by Philippe's melancholic eyes, and the moments when they are together filled me with an authentic feeling-good sentiment. Definitely, a must-see picture."
luiscarvalho,"Apr 4, 2012",10/10,"This movie completely brought magic to my life. I don't remember the last time I've seen such an awesome movie.At the moment, this is my favorite movie.I had a bad opinion about the French people but after watching this movie my opinion has changed. I've learned a lot after watching it. What did I learn ? Holding everything I have to the most, loving everyone I have on my life and really living your life.This movie makes you want to get out and breathe, loving your world, how beautiful it is.I completely recommend it, I've rated it 10 out of 10.I'm sorry for any mispelling as English is not my primary language."
aasenindahouse,"Jul 24, 2012",10/10,"By just looking at the front-cover for this movie, I could imagine this would be something good. The beginning really got me into it and I just wanted to see what would happen later in the movie. It did not take long before I actually felt that I was in their lives. From start to the end I was just stunned by all emotions this movie gave out.I had never thought that I was both going to laugh and cry at the same time, just to mention I am not that guy who easily get affected by a movie. This was something really impressing! To all out there who not have seen this movie, I really recommend doing it. You may be thinking this is a another boring drama, but after seeing it I can tell it is more than drama. Comedy mixed with love, feelings and friendship makes this movie something out of its own."
Michael_Elliott,"Aug 5, 2012",N/A,"The Intouchables (2011)**** (out of 4)Terrific comedy-drama from France about Philippe (Francois Cluzet), a rich man who was left paralyzed from the neck down after an accident and Driss (Omar Sy), a man from the ghetto who hasn't had much going on in his life until he gets the job of taking care of the handicapped man. THE INTOUCHABLES has been breaking box office records around the world but I decided to stay away from it because of some rather lukewarm reviews. I'm certainly glad the trailer kept telling me to go see it because no matter what the critics say, this here is a complete winner and it's easy to see why so many people have fallen in love with it. I'm really not sure why so many critics have bashed it for being a ""crowd winner"" or ""too happy"" because neither makes much sense. I thought the film was quite remarkable because the pre-credit sequence is just so touching and funny that you can't help but fall in love with these two characters and the journey of their friendship that follows was incredibly touching and best of all is that it felt real. A lot of credit has to go to the two leads who deliver remarkable performances and I'd be willing to bet that you're not going to see better from anyone the rest of the year. If so, more credit to whoever is better. Cluzet and Sy are simply so terrific in their roles that you really do feel as if you're watching real people with real issues. The way to two play off one another is so remarkable to watch that once you've seen it I don't see how you could forget them. Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano do a remarkable job balancing the comedy with the drama and in the end they really create such a special atmosphere that it's impossible not to get caught up with it. THE INTOUCHABLES is without question one of the best films of the year and hopefully the strong word of mouth from around the world will get more people to check it out."
TheNabOwnzz,"May 7, 2018",6/10,"Ofcourse the entire premise of The Intouchables is a bit of a cliché these days with the strong black man helping the weak white man, yet it is not a film of irrelevant political propaganda and steers clears of this subject quite well.The better parts of the film is primarily that it has some great shots, an incredible piece of piano notes music by Ludovico Einaudi & some great acting by especially Francois Cluzet ( Phillipe ) as the invalid aristocrat. Unfortunately however, the bonding of the two cultures of the main characters make little sense. Driss ( Omar Sy ) does not seem like a particularly nice guy and even his family isn't all too keen on him for reasons that he has caused on his own. Somehow for reasons unknown this eventually changes causing Driss to seemingly even care and freak out about things in Philippe's life that seem to be a bit out of character for him. Yet even though their relationship seems far fetched, it does still have a certain charm to it which makes it convincing enough as a piece of entertainment.The acting is mostly good, especially by Francois as stated before, who does a great job of facial acting too. Omar Sy is a bit inconsistent as Driss due to some weird outbursts & a couple of cringy scenes ( the dancing or the consistent flirting with the secretary becomes quite a cringe to watch ) featuring him which kind of makes me think he is the French Chris Tucker. The film isn't as emotionally powerful as it would like to be. The music by Ludovico Einaudi is a splendid emotional piece, so that is not the problem. The problem seems the movie feels a bit too much like a 'feelgood' movie due to the buddy relationship that the mixes between emotion and light hearted feelgood scenes are hard to make. However, a couple of scenes especially near the end do manage to succeed in this aspect, helped by Einaudi's score and some excellent facial acting by Francois Cluzet.The movie is mostly quite grey and not very pretty, and a lot of shots follow Driss closely from over the shoulder resulting in quite an ugly bouncing camera kind of shots. However, there are a couple of shots where the cinematography really shines. Most of these shots come from the position of the camera behind the two men, with Driss left and Phillipe right, which is a pose used many times during the film. Especially the one right before the parachuting scene is a beautiful one, yet this is followed with quite a weird shot in the parachuting scene itself from some kind of onboard camera like it is a documentary, which is unfortunate since there truly are many great shots in the film, but also a lot of uglier ones.It is a film with some great acting and some lesser acting, some great emotional scenes and some cringy scenes, and some beautiful shots and some ugly ones. While overcoming its cliché concept of a story on a splendid manner, it is not quite as great as it wanted to be."
costounet2-1,"May 12, 2012",10/10,"I'm 21 and have lived in France nearly all my life. My cousin recommended this film to me and when I saw that Omar Sy was one of the main actors, I just laughed. For those of you who don't know, Omar Sy is one half of a famous Canal + sketch comedy show called Omar & Fred. To sum it up, it is very light hearted, even silly, comedy. However, to see him perform at this level and with such ease simply amazed me. The relationship & chemistry created between the two characters in the film would make you believe that Omar & François Cluzet were best friends in real life.François Cluzet is also excellent in this film. To a certain extent, his performance reminds me a bit of Dustin Hoffman's in Rain Man. This role shows how versatile he is as an actor. The last film I saw him in was ""Ne Le Dis à Personne"" (Tell No One) and his role in that is, literally, the complete opposite, yet he pulls off both wonderfully.I have seen my fair share of ""touching"" movies but this completely blew me away. If you have 1 hour 40 minutes of your time to spare, please, use it to watch this film. You will not regret it."
estebangonzalez10,"Jun 5, 2012",9/10,"¨Sometimes you have to reach into someone else's world to find out what's missing in your own.¨ Intouchables is a remarkable ¨feel good¨ French film mostly about friendship, but there is a little bit of drama and a love story included as well. This film with relatively unknown directors and actors has managed to make some big noise in Europe, and especially in France where it has become the second highest grossing French film of all time. The key to the success of Intouchables relies on the great chemistry and performances from Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy. They are just absolutely great in this film and their friendship felt authentic and real. The movie mixes the drama with the comedy really well and it works better than most films have in the past when combining two different and sometimes opposite characters together. Sy and Cluzet play totally different characters who come from very different backgrounds, and although we've seen this play out in hundreds of films in the past it works really well here thanks to their terrific performance and a great script from the directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Cluzet has a sort of a Dustin Huffman vibe and he says so much with his expressions without having to say anything at times, while Sy plays a more outgoing character who isn't afraid to speak his mind. This odd pairing reminded me a lot of another film which I really loved, Goodbye Solo which follows a similar premise at times. Intouchables is a feel good movie, but it transcends the term at times and becomes much more. An absolute must see, especially if you've ever had to work or live with a handicapped person.Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a very rich quadriplegic who lives in his mansion with several servants and his teenage daughter. He is hiring a live-in carer once again (since most only last a couple of days with him). Driss (Omar Sy) happens to be applying for the job, but actually just wants to get rejected so he can live on welfare without having to work. He's been in prison for the last 6 months and away from home, but Philippe decides to actually hire Driss for the job considering he is someone different who doesn't look at him with empathy and actually treats him like a normal person. Driss and Philippe come from very different backgrounds, but they seem to complement each other very well. Philippe is a millionaire who's interested in art and classical music; while Driss comes from a poor African background, who's interested in pop culture mostly and in bands such as Earth, Wind, and Fire. Driss is really outgoing and becomes really close friends with Philippe. Together they share various stories about their past and end up helping each other solving some present conflicts. There are some other secondary characters whose names I don't even remember because they are not very important to the story, but mostly revolving around other house servants.Intouchables is actually loosely based on a true story involving a quadriplegic and his Arab carer who ends up befriending him. The directors actually came across a documentary about these two men and decided to film a movie about it. One of the greatest things about the film beside the inspiring story was the casting. Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet were really the perfect match and they had me laughing real hard at times and at the border of tears during others. It is truly an emotional and powerful film, a story that will stick with you long after the film ends, and by the time the credits role you will have a smile on your face. It is a feel good movie, but never feels cursi or anything like that. I was really surprised with Omar Sy and hope he gets many more roles. This is really a great French film, very different from Le Prophet but just as good. I had a really good time watching this movie and recommend it to everyone.http://estebueno10.blogspot.com"
Chuba63,"Feb 2, 2012",10/10,"A typical, wonderful, french film, full of surprises that grip the mind and the heart, being an Englishman living in France and having a good grip on the French language this film enveloped me like a cozy blanket on the sofa on a Sunday.The Acting is marvelous, the scripting is genius, and the Paris 'decor' helps to give it a certain romance between the 2 principal actors.A must see even if you can't understand French get yourself an auto-translator or take some french student with you that can translate ""en-direct"".Go watch it!"
requiem_andrey,"Jun 9, 2012",9/10,"I saw this title and I was really skeptical to the storyline : ""Another comedy drama that will neither make you live the story alongside the characters (feel their emotions) nor will it make you laugh"" that is what i thought. But men was i wrong. I love the way François Cluzet and Omar Sy play in this movie ; so natural , so good. I lived every second of the movie like it was my life. I came to like Driss and Philippe as real characters and now at the end of the movie i wonder where did they go. That is the kind of emotion this movie generates. It has everything you could expect from a great movie : story, characters, laughs and cries, tension and so on. You won't regret seeing this movie alone or with someone. I appreciate great work when i see it and this film made me take into consideration seeing more french movies as it improved my opinion on them. Enjoy this movie and every frame of it :D."

It shook me and made me realize that when you have nothing to lose then you have all to earn. It start with two mans that are in the lowest points of there lives. They are so different yet so connected.

It is funny, it is serious and has a story to tell which won't leave you intouché.First I though this is going to be more or less a cultural film for a selected audience. But this wasn't true at all. This is a film for the broad audience, and I think it can be appreciated by everybody.I don't know if this film has been dubbed in English, it will certainly lose some of it charisma. If you understand french, then get it in the original voice.Give it a try, you won't be disappointed. It is a beautiful movie."
aamilsyed,"Apr 27, 2019",6/10,"Western filmmakers tend to make stories where someone poor who has zest for life meets someone really rich, but tired of life and turns their life around. In such movies, one often sees the impact that the poor person has on rich person's life, but seldom do the filmmakers try to tell the story from the poor person's point of view. The focus is the rich man and his boring life and how it can be turned around by a poor person who sees it in a different light. Towards the end of the movie, the poor person gets little or nothing out of the exchange, but the rich guy walks away with deep insights and a newfound will to live. It's really unfair how such films portray poor people (recurring trope of them being awestruck by bathrooms) and paint them as incapable of doing anything unless aided by the money from the rich person. I think that's because the target audience is rich people who will pay to watch a movie which gives them some hope."
axb,"Aug 12, 2012",5/10,"This french film starts with a Dustin Hoffman look-alike actor being driven by a black driver (Omar Sy) who is fond of Earth, Wind and Fire music and has a swagger made popular by many a black Hollywood actors including Eddie Murphy. In the typical Hollywood fashion he comes from the wrong side of tracks (think of Murphy in Trading Places), but ends up living in a Paris mansion (again echoes of Trading Places) taking care of a quadriplegic (François Cluzet). Somehow he learns to take care of his patient and in fact becomes quite an accomplished male nurse. The transition is mildly amusing, and won't bother you if you checked your skepticism at the door before entering the movie theater. If you have any doubts about whether or not this film is in the genre called Hollywood fantasy, you have to see what our tough man with heart of gold does next. He decides to teach his boss how to be a good father and ultimately becomes cupid for his boss. The film plays on the obvious disparities between expectations and attitudes of the privileged and under classes in ways that are funny. If you wish to enjoy this film, please keep your expectations low and ignore the obvious visual and other tricks. One of the early scenes shows a row of shoes and socks of the candidates waiting to be interviewed for the nurse's job. As the camera pans, all candidates are wearing shiny shoes with clean socks, but one pair stand out for being dirty and incongruous. Of course, they belong to Omar Sy's character and he gets the job at this super-rich household. How fuuunny!! I predict that in two to three years there will be a Hollywood clone of this film with Dustin Hoffman and Chris Rock playing the main characters. And it will be a box office hit."

You would be foolish not to see this film.I have read that they want to remake this movie in America, however, I don't see why they should do such a thing. It is perfect exactly the way it is. Nothing about the movie needs to be changed one bit. Absolutely Oscar-worthy - saddens me that it was made in 2011 and this is the first I had heard of it. It leaves you with a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.Don't miss it - you will be sorry!!"
rubytuez,"Nov 20, 2021",9/10,"I loved this film. It was sweet and charming. The comedy is well placed, the acting is warm and realistic. And as a former CNA this was a welcome cinematic reminder of the clients who feel more like friends."
panosflor,"Nov 8, 2022",10/10,"It's a movie that touches your soul.In the midst of difficult situations a friendship is created,
a person who has not accepted his disability finds a person who looks him in the eye for who he is and not for what he shows,
between twists, comedic situations and tears.There are people who, when they see this movie, might recognize themselves among the characters.We will see moments where you will feel intense moments
It's also a good teen movie as it contains some great life lessons.I have seen this movie many times and it always gives me a beautiful feeling to see a much better side of people."
view_and_review,"Jan 4, 2022",9/10,"""The Intouchables"" took a tried and true formula, tweaked it a bit, and made a sensational movie. The idea of ""The Odd Couple"" has been around for ages. We see it most in buddy cop movies, but it also rears its head in other genres. I, for one, have gotten tired of the idea of polar opposites becoming friends. It's not that I don't appreciate or like the idea, it's just that it has been done so often. The very thought of having to watch two people get to know each other and appreciate their differences makes me roll my eyes. ""The Intouchables"" takes the idea, guts it, and gives us a gem.Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy star as Philippe and Driss. Philippe is a wealthy, paralyzed, white Frenchman who is in need of a caretaker. Driss is a poor, somewhat hood, African Frenchman who is just looking for a job. Driss has no passion for healthcare nor is he at all sensitive towards Philippe's condition, he just wants a paycheck. What you don't expect is that Philippe admires this about Driss. Philippe doesn't want a caretaker who feels pity for him, he wants one that treats him like any other able-bodied human being. And I think that's where the movie distinguished itself. Instead of us suffering through a contentious relationship that slowly transformed into something special, they were practically friends from the start, even if they didn't recognize it. Philippe wanted Driss as a caretaker and Driss wasn't going to pass up a good paying job.Their relationship grows over time from one of employer and employee to friendship. It's a funny movie that seems to hit all the right buttons. Driss is not so hood and criminal as to repulse you while Philippe is not so steeped in self-pity so as to depress you. I think their personalities were perfect for each other and perfect for the big screen."
Billy_Boy_,"Jul 1, 2025",7/10,"First of all, The Intouchables is a movie that's just very easy to enjoy and very watchable. The two main actors have great chemistry, the story's sweet, and it's got a good mix of laughs and heart. It's the kind of film that leaves you smiling by the end.That said, it didn't really blow me away. It's a solid feel-good movie, but pretty predictable and plays things safe. You kind of know where it's going from the start, and that's fine - just don't expect anything super deep or unique.Overall, a good time and definitely worth a watch, especially if you're in the mood for something light and uplifting."
simonpery,"May 30, 2016",9/10,"When I first saw Intouchables I thought it was great! I really loved the environment and the outstanding performance by Omar Sy and François Cluzet! The second time, I thought it was even better! All the details and the story itself.and the expressions of François Cluzet, is really breathtaking! He deserves an Oscar for his performance!(!!!) and I think the movie itself is worth an Oscar for 'Best film', 'best actor(s)', 'best photo' and 'best director'! I really recommend it for all kinds of people, exceptionally you with a sense of details and acting!You can't walk untouched from this movie!"
jose-cruz53,"Sep 29, 2012",4/10,"Its a harmless clichéd ridden comedy. Its identical to Hollywood films in pacing, plot and structure. Its well executed and may be entertaining for someone who doesn't have a sophisticated taste for movies.The fact that one of the main characters is quadriplegic doesn't affect the basic plot by any measurable degree. Its a traditional story of a rich guy meets a poor guy and the two become friends. The rich guy likes classical music, the poor guy likes pop music. The rich guy likes art, the poor guy, prostitutes. Etc The cliché goes on and on. Only someone who has watched few movies will be impressed by this story: its extremely conventional.The jokes can be funny sometimes. Specially the ones where the characters exploit the fact that he is quadriplegic. Since one cannot find these jokes in other comedies. But overall the film is okay, but not good and is not worthy of being viewed in a theater."
MnicaB-2,"May 17, 2025",10/10,"This movie was truly captivating from beginning to end. The story unfolds in a way that keeps you emotionally invested and eager to see what happens next. The actors delivered outstanding performances that felt genuine and powerful. The direction and cinematography were visually stunning, making each scene a piece of art. The soundtrack also added depth and emotion to key moments. It's the kind of film that stays with you long after the credits roll. I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys quality storytelling and strong performances. It's not just a film - it's an emotional journey that leaves a lasting impression."
lindasmith-14374,"Nov 13, 2024",9/10,"From the moment I sat down to watch ""The Intouchables,"" I was swept away by the film's unique blend of humor and heart. The story revolves around two men from vastly different backgrounds-Driss, a young man from the projects, and Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic. What struck me most was how effortlessly the film navigated the complexities of their friendship, avoiding the typical tropes of sentimentality that often plague similar narratives.Omar Sy's portrayal of Driss is nothing short of phenomenal. His charisma and comedic timing had the entire audience laughing, but it was his genuine warmth that really resonated with me. I found myself rooting for him not just as a caregiver, but as a friend who brought joy and spontaneity into Philippe's life. François Cluzet, on the other hand, brought a depth to Philippe that was both poignant and relatable. His character's struggles were palpable, yet he approached life with a sense of humor that was infectious.The chemistry between Sy and Cluzet was electric. Their banter felt so natural, it was as if I was witnessing a real friendship unfold before my eyes. One scene that stood out to me was when Driss introduces Philippe to the world of modern art. The way they navigated the absurdity of the situation was both hilarious and touching, showcasing how they learned from each other and grew together.The film's soundtrack was another highlight, perfectly complementing the emotional beats of the story. Each song felt like a character in itself, enhancing the moments of joy and reflection. I found myself tapping my feet and smiling during the uplifting sequences, while also feeling a lump in my throat during the more somber moments.What I appreciated most about ""The Intouchables"" was its ability to tackle serious themes-like disability, class, and friendship-without descending into melodrama. Instead, it celebrated life in all its messiness. It made me reflect on my own relationships and the importance of connection, regardless of societal barriers.As the credits rolled, I felt a mix of emotions-joy, sadness, and an overwhelming sense of gratitude. ""The Intouchables"" is not just a film; it's an experience that lingers long after viewing. It reminded me that true friendship knows no bounds and that laughter can be a powerful tool for healing. This film is a beautiful testament to the human spirit, and I left the theater feeling uplifted and inspired."
lucaswgondim,"May 29, 2022",9/10,"Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, the duo who wrote and directed ""Intouchables"", made a clever creative decision by setting the movie's goals up right away in the first scene through a break of expectation. The viewer is initially induced to assume that the pair of main characters - Driss (Omar Sy) and Philippe (François Cluzet) - is dealing with some kind of emergency, but the soundtrack, actors' facial expressions and the general tone of the scene suddenly change when it is revealed that the characters were faking the ""emergency"" and merely having fun. This is deeply related to what the film is about: The lighthearted, comic and happy moments of a friendship tale. Even though ""Intouchables"" doesn't completely ignore melancholy, suffering and tension, it doesn't give excessive attention to them like most films about people with disabilities do.Additionally, the fact that the movie is full of hilarious scenes makes it a fairly good option for those viewers who merely want to watch something for fun. There are even some moments which mix sadness and comedy up, in order to not make the story feel utterly depressing at any point. Besides that, the plot also deals with some serious social criticism regarding privilegies and socioeconomic inequality (a factor which is creatively enforced by the colours and scenarios).Ironically, the film's main negative aspect is also related to oppresion and minorities. Driss makes a few mean jokes about overweight people and other groups throughout the movie and frequently takes some annoyingly sexist attitudes towards a female side character. However, although such unnecessary moments might make the viewer mildly uncomfortable, they don't even remotely ruin the full experience. Also, Sy's character doesn't become detestable, given the fact that he is presented with a lot of likeable and relatable personality traits.In conclusion, except for a mildly offensive line here and there, ""Intouchables"" is a great movie with a phenomenal and diverse soundtrack, sympathetic characters, splendid performances, and a creative use of colours and scenarios, so it certainly deserves to be watched."
sexyladyjen,"Jul 31, 2024",10/10,"It has been long since I laughed, cried, and more over, felt over a movie. And this has given me all the feelings to be acquired by a man in just two hours. I have to say, I wasn't expecting much. But after watching this movie twice in one go, I have to say it now.... This is a great movie, a wonderful work and a beautiful tale as it is.The story, from the very start to the very end, is so beautiful. And the performances were mind blowing. This movie can teach you the true essence of life and friendship.I have nothing more to say, except one thing. Its a10/10 for me. What a beautiful story."
barry_mooney,"Oct 10, 2012",9/10,"It was very exciting to hear that 'Untouchable' would finally be shown in the UK after appearing in so many other countries first. Having read plenty of hype about this film I was preparing myself to be disappointed but, luckily, the film felt engaging from the very beginning and went on to be a wonderfully touching and funny experience. There is also a fair amount of excitement and romance thrown in for good measure!Despite appearances, Untouchable is not really about race, disability or class; it's about friendship. The two main characters both feel disconnected from society for various reasons, yet the connection between these two outsiders is so genuine and believable that you are drawn into their relationship. In fact, the performances from Omar Sy and François Cluzet are simply incredible. The massive amount of meaning conveyed in the slightest look between them is acting at its very best. On many occasions, you find yourself laughing with them and the fact that one is a rich white guy in a wheelchair and the other is a poor black guy fresh out of prison ceases to be an issue.One of the most interesting themes for me was the effect that Driss's lack of pity had on Philippe. I understand that the film has been applauded by many disabled groups and I can see why. Pity is a very selfish and unpleasant emotion and I can imagine that the effect of such pity would be quite destructive on a person in Philippe's situation. Driss simply reacts to him in natural and honest way, which is extremely refreshing to see and a lesson for all those who would look down on anybody with pity.The film is not without flaws however. It is a little 'lightweight' in places and there are a few clichés here and there (even though the film manages to avoid most of the more obvious stereotyping). The subtitles are also not brilliant in places and some of the meaning is slightly lost on occasion, but I guess that happens all the time. Overall, I would have said that this was a lovely 8/10 'feelgood movie' but the superb quality of acting easily bumps it up to a 9. Unmissable."
Ladigue1,"Oct 18, 2012",9/10,"After watching this beautiful film I felt two things. Shame at my prior laziness for avoiding any non-English speaking films and excitement for the wealth of films I am about to discover. There is a film world outside of the UK and USA. Anyway I haven't much to say about the film, you'll get a good incite into it by watching the trailer. From the subject matter I assumed at some point during the film I would need tissues to dry my tears which would have made reading subtitles difficult but thankfully I didn't. At times its sad but is also uplifting throughout. Its just a lovely film and may throw caution to the wind by watching it again without the subtitles!"
bob the moo,"Dec 4, 2013",N/A,"I'm not sure how I came to be watching this film; I had heard of it some time ago and added it to the queue without knowing too much about it other than it was successful in its home market. Supposedly based on a true story, the plot sees a rich quadriplegic employ a rather colorful young man to be his new live-in caretaker. We open the film with a flash-forward but quickly go back to the start of the relationship and quickly are let in on the ground floor regarding how this film will be. Basically Philippe is uptight and locked within himself mentally almost as much as physically, while Driss is carefree and very different from those in Philippe's world. Will the odd-couple become friends and perhaps benefit one another's lives somehow? Well, only time (and the genre) will tell.Of course this is pretty much what happens but you know this from the odd-couple comedy/drama feel that it has from the getgo and it is fairly shameless about doing it. There isn't really a depth to the film but rather a superficial but entertaining pace and plot. It feels cynical for the most part but yet somehow it works if you can get through some cringe-inducing ""heart-warming"" moments. A big part of it working is plain and simply the two actors in the lead roles. Neither gives a brilliant performance individually but together they have real chemistry and their banter and shared moments do have a certain genuine and intimate feel that is all down to the delivery. By themselves Cluzet is solid and Sy clowns it up for all he is worth, but yet both are quite charming and likable all the way to the end.Ultimately it is fairly shameless crowd-pleasing fare which airbrushes life into a series of fun set-pieces. It really never touches a real nerve but it is still enjoyable thanks to the warm tone and strong chemistry between the two leads."
EddardWinterhammer,"Apr 2, 2012",6/10,"When I first saw ""Intouchables"", it hadn't become the French box office hit it is now, in fact I hadn't heard of it or watched a trailer before seeing the film. Members of my family who were there with me were absolutely enchanted when we got out, but I merely shrugged.I remember thinking, early on in the film: ""It seems they sort of know what they're doing"", what with the very expressive visual choices in terms of setting and photography. But as the movie went on, all traces of artistic flair were lost for good.The characters are flat and are only here so that the audience can have a good laugh and be forced to accept the old fallacy that a movie with disabled people can only be good. Then again, I found myself smiling at various points of the movie, but I only think it is sad that the movie abandons its interesting story and social context: by the end, it does not consist of much more than a long thread of random jokes. Francois Cluzet is too distancing in the role of a jaded paraplegic, but Omar Sy makes the most of his (very) limited part. It is only through this character that the film manages to take a stand against prejudices without feeling divorced from reality or from the cinematic necessities of storytelling and character development.Let's sum things up this way: the movie had a great beginning in which it properly introduced the world of the story, Omar Sy's performance is really engaging, and yes, the film is VERY entertaining and beautiful, but it is not realistic enough nor ready to put its many jokes in context."
Sanou_san,"Apr 28, 2012",10/10,"It's been a while since I wrote a comment for a movie. I rarely find the luxury of time praising a well crafted movie that doesn't give a damn of any social issues. And it's totally rare for me to have the lucky chance finding a foreign movie that doesn't need to tell its masterpiece beauty. First of all, all the time I was watching the movie I thought I was staring at Dustin Hoffman playing well a disabled nobleman being taken care of by a straight-thinking commoner. I know the overreacted dire issues this movie is being pestered, but I don't really care what other people say how the movie should have been. It's an obvious sign already that this movie topped 111 (and may still elevate) in IMDb top 250 movies that a lot of sensible reviewers appreciated its simplicity. The reason indeed probably why the crew casted a black man instead of Arabian to portray the character because maybe simply Omar Sy just had the skill to fit in to the character's delicate vessel. Why so locked with the racism issue? Other may had been suggestive but it's not an extreme case to horribly condemn the movie of its simple choice. I just don't understand people who can't keep their bloody mind open. Well either way the movie had its story straightforwardly rendered and its worth approving rather than condemning. I even laughed so hard when Driss (Omar) just naturally cackled all over the man dressed like a tree singing at the top of his voice, man that was really a humorous punch. The drama Well done.Ten stars would be more than it deserved."
askeland89,"Sep 6, 2022",10/10,"Still struggling to understand why this masterpiece didn't receive a single Oscar nomination, not even for best foreign film. And Omar Sy should have been nominated for best male actor as he practically stole every scene he was involved in. It felt natural, as if there were no acting involved. If it was made today it would sweep the ceremony, no question. At times it made me laugh uncontrollably, and the humor comes naturally rather than through telling jokes as with most comedies. Although this is not strickly a comedy, it falls more under comedy/drama. It tends to get serious at times. The fact that this is based on a true story makes it even more incredible.This is an absolute ""Must see!"". If you haven't already, do it now!And by all means stay away from the soulless American made remake called ""The Upside"". This is the only version you will ever need."

Watch it to see how to live your life even when you think it's too hard sometimes. Watch it if you still don't believe life is wonderful. Watch it if you're bored with your life, if you think there's no point or no hope. Watch it if you've stopped enjoying simple things. The plot is simply thrilling, the acting as well,with a large amount of extremely good humour plus a great deal of equally amazing music. You have to be careful, however, as once you've watched the movie for the first time you will not be able to keep your mind off it and the beautiful music makes it even more difficult... Watch it. :]"
StefanHighlander,"May 6, 2012",10/10,"This flick is as touching as it is intouchable.I rated it a ten and keep in mind that it didn't catch my eyes nor ears in the beginning. However, the overall feeling I'm having after having watched this rather lengthy masterpiece; is a calm and thoughtfulness that I haven't felt since I watched the almost six hour long Italian film, La meglio gioventù.One would think that the main two characters, Philippe and Driss, had been living together for 20 years before the recording of this movie. The chemistry between the two of them is something extraordinary. Something intouchable.Together, they complement each other in a way that is unusual in today's films. Driss, who embodies a ""'pragmatic'"" African french youth with lots of temperament and a great deal of emotional luggage. Philippe, being in the state that he is, can't use his body language the way that Driss can. He has to rely on his facial expressions. Something he is mastering very well.I didn't want the film to end. I wanted it to continue as a TV series, one can come home to and watch after a stressful day at work.I don't want to say anything more about this lovely 112 minute long touching movie without spoiling the experience for the ones that still haven't seen it.But, who could not love this one? Yours sincerely /Kristoffer"
Niejan,"Jun 5, 2012",10/10,"The Intouchables (2011) is one of the best movies I have seen in a very long time. There are no action heroes or good-looking women necessary to make this film perfect. It's all about the story and the development of its characters. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy did a great job there. Their performances were memorable and well fitted. The story as in the real life story has been portrayed, in my opinion, brilliantly. Of course we can expect a lot of things to have been added to the entertaining production, but nevertheless a lot morally correct life lessons are included as well. This movie makes you search for humanity within yourself as it illustrates how a guy from the low, social classes in Paris can be a true friend and ally of this rich, handicapped person. Subsequently, the writers and producers have creatively played with this and have 'covered' the seriousness of the movie to seconds while the major events have been coated in a fun and inspiring way. The movie is enjoyable for all ages and backgrounds. So I strongly recommend all of you to watch this movie - try to enjoy the jokes, but also take note of the messages conveyed by the movie. Totally worth every second! 10/10"
matanelrox,"Apr 3, 2016",7/10,"Let me start off by mentioning what I liked about this movie. The casting was great, and both Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet did outstanding jobs, and the relationship between them seems natural. It was also a very funny movie- though watching with subtitles, i couldn't help but fall for Dris's charm and laugh out loud. Unfortunately, the above-mentioned just isn't enough to qualify this movie for being considered great.I expected a sensitive, understated French film- what i witnessed was nothing but a feel-good Hollywood movie with little to no substance. Where was the point of conflict? Philip and Dris's relationship, which was- I believe- the point of the movie, suffered no breaking points, no hardship. There were a few points of conflict in Dris's life, which never really resolved themselves.In addition, the frequent use of jump cuts and short takes, while useful for comedic effect, blocked this movie from being anything but a group of amusing anecdotes about the relationship between invalid and reluctant caretaker and finally between two friends. There was very little substantial storyline, replaced by various amusing scenes.I mentioned before that this was a feel-good Hollywood movie, and that in my opinion is the worst part. The film was full of unrealistic scenarios and characters, a sort of la la land where very little struggle is revealed to us.Look, I did enjoy Intouchables. But I don't think it deserves to be in the IMDb top 100, and I believe it was a wasted opportunity."
mgdonker,"May 9, 2012",10/10,"This movie is so good that we watched it twice in two days. Such friendship honest, true and natural is something to be jealous about in the most positive way. A big surprise, so it needs a lot of very positive comments because you do not want to miss this one. Although you may think this is a dramatic movie, it is actually more a very warm movie loaded with very good humor. The trailers, advertisement and also the Dutch tittle actually first put us of to watch this movie. Then it is also a French movie so normally that comes with a lot of not too positive expectations. This all is easily overwon within just the first few minutes of the movie but gets totally shattered the longer the movie lasts."
wokepeopleareacancer,"Feb 22, 2022",1/10,"How this is in the 57th highest rated position on imdb is beyond my understanding Too much cliche, too much recycled plot, the wheelchair user's performance is the only thing that can be saved this same type of movie has been made countless times and any one is better than this version!

theonewithallthecontacts,"Jan 5, 2013",10/10,"The Intouchables has already been awarded tons of awards and made over 400 million dollars, making it the most successful French film to date... Everything is deserved. First of all, this is a movie where you will end up laughing maniacally. The film has a lot of humor, some with a nice British edge to them, and everything is so real and cheesy as it would be in real life. And that is the best thing about the humor! I must pay my gratitude to Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet! Both manage to create a realistic and moving friendship on-screen! The thing is that they are two entirely difficult individuals, Philippe (Cluzet) is a wealthy man in a wheelchair, Driss (Sy) is an ordinary, poor guy with a lot of siblings! You follow how a friendship can evolve between these two entirely different persona's, and what their ordinary day would be like, together. Cluzet and Sy gives humanistic and brilliant performances, worthy of an Oscar nom for the both of them! The film is a masterpiece from start to finish, with deep messages, humor and remarkable performances! This movie would be my pic for ""The Best Foreign Language Film"" at the Oscars! Heard that Weinstein bought the rights to the film, with the intention of doing a remake. Dear Hollywood: Don't bother..."
Luigi Di Pilla,"Sep 9, 2012",10/10,Another great film from the French film industry that made a great echo all over the globe. All this with a low budget and a story inspired by true events. The tetra person was played very convincing by François Cluzet. Omar Sy delivered a surprising and respectable performance. I find that the Intouchables should deserve at least an Oscar. I laughed a lot about all the funny jokes and adventure scenes. Each one of the sequences had lot of emotions and every detail of the handicapped man was well studied. The running time was not too long for me. I didn't expect such a beautiful happy end. Just see it and let you surprise how nice it is. 10/10.
abrahovic,"Aug 10, 2022",10/10,"I watched it in french class in school and I have to admit that it was one of the best french film I ever watched. INCROYABLE.How the protagonist change through the film isn't something new, but how they played it and how they showed us the difference between these kind of groups in the world, or in our example France, it's just magnifque. If you haven't seen this film yet, what are you waiting for then?"
gabrimelul,"Mar 1, 2020",10/10,"This review is mainly a critique, not of the movie, but of the American Movie Reviewers.To start off, i'm not from the United States, I'm from Spain. There have been good TV shows and music coming out of spain for years, but films is the one thing we cannot do, due to all films having to be comedies which a part of them are not understandable by international (specially American) audiences due to the politics and very vast culturl differences.You may think that had nothing to do with the critique, but it does more than you think. Just like Spain, France does have a very different culture, being even one of the European countries with most differences to the United States. Most of the critic reviews i've read about this film state things that are true in the states when talking about social class levels, but when it comes to France, it is completley different.This films is very captivating, and incredibly emotional, one of the best foreign fils I've seen in years, comparable to 2019's Parasite (not as good), and 2018's Roma.
Also something that may bias me, it that i have seen this movie religiously, and knowing a basic french understanding helps.If i were to reccomend 3 french films these would be the order:
1) Intouchable
2) Le Choristes
3) Les Miserables (2019) {Not the musical}"
dionnemking,"Oct 6, 2012",N/A,"The fantastic, life-affirming comedy Untouchable, from Writer/ Directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, is a breath of fresh air that surpasses the hype.From the opening roar of a Maserati pursued by police along the Parisian périphérique, Untouchable captivates. At the wheel Driss, (Omar Sy) a young, Senegalese street hustler, bets his passenger, Philippe (François Cluzet) a middle-aged, bourgeois Parisian, he can escape. Cornered but not defeated, Driss ups the ante to secure a police escort. With Phillippe aping a potentially fatal fit, Driss races to A&E with Earth, Wind and Fire blaring above the attendant sirens.Flash back to Driss, fresh from a prison stretch, unwelcome at his Mother's overcrowded flat on the sprawling Berlioz housing slum. Living on benefits conditional on attending interviews, Driss applies to care for Philippe, a rich quadriplegic confined to his first arrondissement mansion. Devoid of pity or reverence for Philippe's rarefied world, Driss's open about his motivation optimistically coming on to Magalie (Audrey Fleurot), Philippe's assistant. Although totally unsuitable, Philippe withholds his signature to satisfy the benefit agency. Forced to return, Driss around his expansive quarters and homeless, Driss reluctantly accepts a trial recoiling at the indignities expected of him. Despite initial tantrums and ineptitude, Driss develops an unlikely relationship with Philippe that transforms the entire household.Untouchable, contrary to the tragic set up, is one of the funniest comedies of the year. Creative collaborators Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano have produced a string of popular and critical successes since 1995. They took France by storm when Untouchable, based on a true story, was originally released in November 2011. The films worldwide release has broken box office records for a French language film, racked up awards, contending for an Oscar and already scheduled to be remade in English by The Weinstein Company; it will need a brave director to try and live up to the original.Untouchable's casting is superb. Cluzet plays Philippe, a former adrenalin junkie born to entitlement but paralysed in a paragliding accident and mourning his wife. His performance, with the physical limits of Philippe's condition, is an expressive master class, his comic timing perfect. Sy, who emerged from the working-class suburbs of Paris himself, is authentic and effortlessly charismatic as Driss, the aimless, street smart, opportunist whose overwhelming vitality is infectious.Their cultural clashes drive the comedy. Philippe fills his life with intellectual stimulation; poetry, art, opera and classical music repressing the physical pleasures he can no longer feel. Directionless and irresponsible, Driss grasps all life has to offer living in the moment and, forgetting or dismissing his employer's disability. For Philippe Berlioz is the great French composer of the 19th Century; to Driss Berlioz is his family's housing project. While Philippe has poetic epistolic relationships, Driss collects hooker's flyers and constantly propositions Magalie. For his birthday Philippe's extended family gather for a dour classical concert but Driss gets them all grooving to Boogie Wonderland.It's an education for both. The odd couple overcome the barriers of class and race, sharing honesty, humour and contempt for bourgeois pretension. Through Driss' ignorance and innocence, cajoling and challenge, Philippe's rediscovers the pleasures and possibility of life while Driss matures, developing empathy and a knowledge of classical cultural denied his social class.Untouchable avoids sentimentality touching on the deeper issues of social class and discrimination poignantly reminding the viewer to live life to the fullest and embrace our common humanity."
Shilo_R_A,"Nov 7, 2022",7/10,"I have a feeling that I'm writing another short review here, but we shall see.The Intouchables is a French comedy/drama film, based on a true story. The movie follows the relationship between Driss, a young man with unstable life and low economic status, and Philippe, a rich disabled man who's sick of getting looks of pity. As time goes on we see how their bond tightens, and how they manage to help each other grow and evolve.I'll say this: the film is super straight-forward, accessible and simple. The pacing is quite fast and solid. The soundtrack is fun, the cinematography is actually better than I expected, beautiful shots here and there. Some of the jokes fall flat, but some made me laugh out loud. I had a decent amount of emotional investment in the characters, though nothing truly moving. Just enough to keep me interested, to get me to care.Yeah, I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, but it's genuinely so...I don't know, basic? That I don't have much to say here. Nothing in this film is truly special, the way I see it at least, but The Intouchables still has solid amounts of charm and memorable moments. Just enough to make it a good movie, actually. It's not an extremely rewatchable film, but it was definitely a fun, good watching experience overall, with a couple of heartwarming scenes. I'm feeling a 7.0/10 on this one."
120watts,"Apr 18, 2021",9/10,"This is a film that works very well at the core. It's true that many scenes were crass and felt played up for mass-market appeal. I can see why some film critics gave it a lower rating. That, however, seems to me to be missing the forest for the trees.The acting is superb from both Sy and Cluzet. They deliver force, touch and humour, and have strong chemistry. Although they act out stereotypes frequently, they never become the stereotypes. I think this handling is the correct way both to acknowledge and overcome stereotyping, which is something that is all around us and cannot simply be wished away, but must be overcome through force of character. The leading duo (and for that matter the supporting characters) are both believable and likeable.Intouchables is full of light-hearted humour and adventure. Aside from keeping up the flow and entertainment level, there's also a strong life message within. Life is something to be lived, not passively observed. Themes of curiosity, self-awareness, courage and responsibility come across strongly. In this sense, the film is more than just a buddy drama about a quadriplegic and street guy. If these guys can expand their horizons, find joy and adventure, laugh a little at themselves, and take charge of their life and families, then surely we all can.Finally, there are strong metaphorical elements in the storyline. Old aristocratic France is stuck, and relies on immigrant France to keep it moving (literally), and perhaps to bring some life and liveliness too. The two don't often come into such intimate contact, or invade each other's space. But if they did? Lots to think about."
Quinoa1984,"Nov 5, 2015",6/10,"I don't doubt the reasons that people have given for liking very much/loving this film to the point where it became one of France's biggest hits in years and then, not surprising in the least, became a Weinstein Company release in the USA. The Intouchables is the epitome of a ""feel-good"" buddy movie, the kind of movie starring a big black dude that you can show your 90 year old grandmother and she'll take a liking to it as well (unless they have an aversion to, say, pot or Faberge eggs). It's the case of a movie with the kindest, inherently liberal message there is: a man from the projects lucks into a job (via Earth, Wind & Fire and Kool and the Gang as his 'references' at a brief interview), and it's taking care of a very rich man who is a quadriplegic. Over the course of this story they'll grow and become best friends and while the rich white guy can learn to relax a little more, smoke some weed (no, really) and listen to that Kool & the Gang, the dude from the projects gets some Vivaldi, makes an abstract painting that sells for 11 grand, and goes paragliding.Other stuff happens as well, but suffice it to say there's no surprises in this movie. That may not be an issue for most out there. For me, as the movie went along, it was just a little too... safe. That may be a word that doesn't really give much critical credence to what's here, and to be fair the actors really help to ground it in a number of scenes. Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy keep things at a good, even keel as far as making the material work for their equal levels of charm and (sometimes) dismay. Sy especially shows that he can take what could have been a super-typical ""magical negro"" stereotype and not let us forget he's from a slightly less educated background (and a little rougher - see his comments about the rich man's adopted daughter when she mouths off). So on the acting front it's perfectly fine and in the first half I was interested in where this would be going.When I say 'safe' I mean to say that nothing really dramatic is left out there for any of the characters. Any possible conflicts get swept up and resolved even before the third act begins (it almost seem,s like Driss gets some time off working just so he can resolve his small conflicts, or those with his sorta-brother, and then come back). Even with the overriding emotional beat of Philippe's correspondent-love-interest, I never felt any sense that these people would not be together by the end; there's one little bump in this road, maybe two, though it's only with the sense that 'hey, I'm quadriplegic, can't let her see that'. I get that it's something to make us feel for him, that he needs to overcome his fears. But I think a big part of it is an overall 'light' touch; yes, Driss may have a criminal background, and yes he has a big family to support in the projects (not that we see much of them, which seems like an odd choice that they just accept this), and sure Philippe has seemingly all the money in the world (where does he get it from, who knows, rich family, they never say).So in other words, there are stakes here, but given that this man can't walk or move, or that Driss has an upward climb in life, it all comes back to just... silly jokes in a lot of scenes, playful flirting between Driss and a woman in the main house not having it, life lessons learned in montage. It's a movie that has a heart in a good place, I can't question that, and being that it's based on a true story (and boy does the ending remind you!) it's hard to say this wasn't credible in the sense of it coming from real life in a certain way. It may be a certain feeling like it's running through things I could see in a lessor TV movie, the beats of conflicts that one might see on a sitcom even (again the teenage girl plot, where she never feels like a character, just a thing that gets used from time to time to move little events forward). Even the moment where the third act gets into gear, a little conflict as Driss has to go away to fix some things and they call it quits, it's just... OK.If you love this movie, I'm happy for you. For me, it just didn't win me over completely - not so much manipulation or pulling at the heartstrings (though it tries at times), just an overall feeling like it's missing some things that could make it FEEL more important, more substantive."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 25, 2025",9/10,"""The Intouchables"" is a beautiful and heartwarming film that tells a truly inspiring story. What makes it so special is the incredible chemistry between the two lead actors, François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Their performances are brilliant; they have such a natural rapport that their friendship feels completely real and earned. The film's humor is also a major highlight, perfectly balancing the serious themes of disability and loss with moments of genuine joy and laughter. It's a testament to the power of human connection, showing how a friendship can transcend class, race, and physical limitations. It's a film that leaves you with a big smile and a full heart.Is it a remake of another film? No, ""The Intouchables"" is not a remake of another film. It is a French film based on the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver, Abdel Sellou. It was later remade in the United States as The Upside (2017).Is it worth watching? Yes, it is absolutely worth watching. It's a feel-good film that is both funny and deeply moving. The performances are fantastic, and the story is so uplifting and human that it's an experience you won't soon forget."
ksmabach,"Nov 3, 2020",10/10,A beautiful movie. A true heartouching movie about two different people from two different worlds. My favourite movie by far
oonagh-tierney,"Aug 15, 2022",10/10,"I loved this movie. I laughed out loud on many occasions. Driss is infectious and it is such a sweet interaction between Driss and Philippe. Excellent acting, witty lines, heartwarming story. Best movie I've watched in quite a while. If you are happy to read subtitles, this is totally worth it."
Laura_Ratings,"Apr 13, 2022",9/10,"Truly a great movie. I don't watch a lot of French movies but this is just an age-less fantastic movie. It touches lightly on some serious topics but also knows how to implement humour in it. It's a beautiful movie about an unlikely friendship, which is even based on a true story too! A must-see."
homeedition-05705,"Jun 1, 2022",10/10,"I've seen the film more than 20 times and I love it every time. The plot, the actors..., a thoroughly brilliant film. Big respect to everyone involved!"
SnoopyStyle,"Sep 6, 2013",6/10,"This is a feel-good French movie full of all the stereotypes based on a true story. I won't rate the real story. But how does it stand as a movie? Philippe is an aristocratic quadriplegic white millionaire living in Paris, and he's interviewing for a personal carer. Driss is an arrogant African who is only interviewing to get a signature for his social assistance form.The characters are truly stereotypes. On top of it all, I don't particularly like either characters. Philippe is uptight but his paralysis really restrict his acting. Driss is Arrogant Without Reason. Add a stereotypical large immigrant family, and you've got the standard street hustler.When Driss draws a painting, everybody is surprised. Why? I didn't know black people can't draw. Are the French really that racist and ignorant? The actual man this character is based on is a Muslim. That would have been a fascinating in-depth character rather than this simplistic caricature. There was one possible great moment. Driss stole a Fabergé egg from Philippe. When Philippe brings it up, there were many different ways it could have gone. The film chooses one of the least interesting. That's indicative of the whole movie. I don't hate the movie. I'm just ambivalent. Definitely no more than 6/10. It's insane that this is a 10 in anybody's rating."
BeoBaxter91,"Jun 21, 2022",9/10,"This film is great and a long, complicated dissection is hardly needed. What makes this film, put simply, are the performances. The story is straightforward, familiar with just enough unique elements to give it a freshness. But even if it was a retread (and there are parts of the film that keep it from being a perfect 10) the acting would still make it a must watch. I highly recommend."
Vartiainen,"Feb 13, 2018",6/10,"The masterpiece of directors Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. A story of a ghetto black man (Omar Sy), who ends up getting a job as the life-in caregiver for a wealthy quadriplegic aristocrat (François Cluzet). And what do you know, the black man ends up teaching the aristocrat some fantastic new things about life. Think Driving Miss Daisy in modern day Paris.This film feels and looks nice. The cinematography, all the technical aspects really, look, sound and feel great. It's definitely a professionally made film. I also have to praise the performance of the two main leads. Cluzet's character is a very reserved, very stoic gentleman, which means that he doesn't have quite as much room to really let loose acting-wise, but even still he gives a praiseworthy performance. But it's Sy who's the star of the movie, with his boundless energy, his ever-ending optimism and his streetwise manners that give none and expect none.All that being said, the story is clichéd. Based on a true story, sure, but the fact still remains that daytime TV is filled with films just like this one. This is no doubt better directed, better filmed and better acted than any of those fluff films, but you still end up feeling like you're being pandered towards.Still, it just might be that I'm biased towards these kinds of stories. It is a well-crafted film, after all. If the premise interests you, by all means, give it a watch."

mihajlotarasenko,"May 25, 2022",8/10,"I am not a big fan of movies in whole, nevertheless ""1+1"" expected me. It turned out to be touching comedy drama, that took place in real life. Besides, film Omar Si stars, nowadays is also popular and has demand.The plot based on rich man,who name is Filip, whose body is paralyzed due to unhappily accident. He needs in helper who must always be care with him. Every people who comes to Filip, gave up. However, one day someone comes ot him for an interview. It is Dell-a former prisoner, released from prison, who. Needs work, moreover , they completely find common language. And Filip becomes see on life on the other hand.I just found this movie absolutely amazing. It expected me by plot, by this history about two different persons who help each other to change outlooks on life. It shows brightly how important is supporting in our live. There are now effects no blood or exposions, it seems to be very easy but we cant get away from the screen while watching this masterpiece. The bright beauty of this film is added by the fact that it is based on real events that took place in real life and this makes this film even more attractive and interesting.On top of that, artists, who played in this film are professionals of their doing. Omar Si, who played one of the main roles, is excellent as always. He is also hilarious, sometimes sad, for example, when he asked another assistant to go on a date with him and she denyed, sometimes even angry when he had arguments his family, in particular, a mother who didnot realy love her son for his criminal past. Fransua Kluse also is very professional artist
All in all, I was amazed that, that I like this movie, because its realy rare thing.I recommend this picture to everyone."
vincenzoangeloni,"Feb 2, 2021",9/10,"I can't really pinpoint exactly what gives this movie the feel that it has. It's goofy and feel-good yet touching, all without being a definite genre. I've never seen a French movie before I watched this, and I only watched it because it's so highly rated. Prior to viewing, I was minimally interested in the plot, a little doubtful, and kinda iffy about having to read subtitles. But now I'm so happy I saw this. Just listening to the beautiful piano pieces at the beginning and end of this film fill me with emotion that isn't sad nor happy, just one that gives me that feeling of a long quiet night on the road, silently enjoying the company of a great friend. This film doesn't have huge questions to ponder, and it doesn't have melodramatic characters and subplots, at least not too obviously. This is a caring, charming movie that can calm a restless mind, bring a spark of hope and fun to anyone's life, and make you think about it a lot. I'm glad I didn't give up on this movie just because it's in a foreign language!"
IulianI-2,"Apr 7, 2025",10/10,"The Intouchables is a funny, warm, and beautiful movie about friendship. It tells the story of Philippe, a man in a wheelchair, and Driss, a young man who becomes his helper. At first, they are very different-Philippe is calm and serious, and Driss is full of energy and jokes. But soon, they become great friends who learn from each other. Driss helps Philippe enjoy life again, and Philippe shows Driss how to care and be responsible. They laugh a lot and do fun things together. The movie is based on a true story, which makes it even more special. It shows how friendship can change lives, no matter how different people are."
paulmorrison2003,"Jan 16, 2021",10/10,"Take some Comedy, add a little understanding, throw in some Earth Wind & Fire and you have a wonderful, superb top Five Movie, I promise.... I watched this film with my daughter and now every year we have our moment together losing ourselves in this so uplifting movie. It's a movie that is so warm to the heart and serious but also very funny. Squint your eye and for a moment you might think you are watching Dustin Hoffman but that's not being fair to the wonderful French actor Francois Cluzet, who gives an outstanding performance. Omar Sy is excellent playing the rough and ready Driss, whose character makes you laugh so much..... Honestly I'm probably waffling on too much but this movie is in my top Five.... Enjoy...."

As if scenario take from real life.Subject of film is a man who are millionaire meet and a man who lose everything. these mans have different life and different characters but they have very a strong friendship day by day. so film is showing their friendship and their good adventure. And film is nice sample for showing should not be human and race distinction. Moreover every people can make friend with people who have got different life and race.i am regretful for why i did not watch this film in more earlier time, and i suggest this film to every people as permanently :)"
den_quixote,"Feb 13, 2023",6/10,"Other than screaming can't we all get along I really can see absolutely no purpose in this film. What everyone else seems ti interpret as high comedy I am seeing only moderate amusement. As we must know by now the main character is extraordinarily wealthy but as we all know nobody has everything (except for those who do.) The protagonist is wheelchair bound, a quadriplegic or worse, as a result of a hang-gliding accident, which might have been predicted because he risked gliding in bad weather. His wife is almost certainly dead of an unnamed illness (I did not quite understand that part) but that is doubly calamitous since she was the most wonderful woman ever to have lived. He has a spoiled adopted teenage daughter who is involved in a bad relationship. As we meet him he is interviewing for a caretaker/companion and the successful candidate is a Senegalese man who has jumped the line in order get his unemployment form signed so he can leave. The star tells him to return the next morning to get the signed form back, so he leaves, stealing a Faberge egg on the way out. Surprise, surprise when he comes back the next day he has gotten the job. The perks include room and board at a Paris home that Jackie O would have been quite comfortable in. The rest of the movie is so cliche ridden and cloying it is actually insulting to the viewer. Do not waste your time. (And the editing sucks as well.)"
Daevyy,"Sep 22, 2023",10/10,"I just finished this movie, and he surprised me a lot, I am through a tough time in my life, where I see sadness everywhere, but this movie made me look at the world in another way, even though I would love to have a friendship like that, which I don't have, I had someday and reminded me of the good time we had. This movie made me laugh a lot, when I am not laughing I am with a smile on my face.All in this movie is great, the acting, the directing, the songs, there are a lot of bangers in this film, and the cinematography is absolutely one of the best I have seen i my life.

This is a great movie, a wonderful work and a beautiful tale as it is.The story, from the very start to the very end, is so beautiful. And the performances were mind blowing. This movie can teach you the true essence of life and friendship.I have nothing more to say, except one thing. If you are looking for a movie that can melt you literally, you should watch this one."
lorene-bar,"Jun 4, 2012",9/10,"After having broken box office records in its native France and across Europe, The Intouchables is brought to American screens.It's a story about a white man and a black man. The white man is rich and paralyzed from the neck down; the black man is an ex-con from the projects. The former needs a caretaker; the latter needs someone to turn his job application down, so he'll be eligible for unemployment benefits. They meet. They clash. And, against all odds, they become friends.That's the plot of The Intouchables (based on a true story), and that storyline has prompted many American critics to label the film ""racist."" Maybe it's coming from a misunderstanding of some journalists, or from a cultural difference between USA and France, but race is absolutely not the subject.Indeed, the French title Intouchables which translates literally as untouchable, refers to the 5th Indian caste, these people ostracized by society, as the two characters. Philippe is rich but quadriplegic from a paragliding accident. Opposite, Driss is full of life, but he is poor and comes from the suburbs. His disability is purely social. Using humor to explore the sensitive topics of class inequality, and quality of life for handicapped individuals is a tall order for filmmakers of any country. However, directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano accomplished all of this.An irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility, The Intouchables depicts an unlikely camaraderie rooted in honesty and humor between two individuals who, on the surface, would seem to have nothing in common. A great film!"
henry8-3,"Jun 30, 2020",6/10,"Extremely rich, disabled Cluzet hires street smart ex con Sy to help him. They learn from each other and much fun is had by all.Despite rather typical messages about learning from each other which doesn't make for hugely original cinema, there is no denying the fun, witty script and the delivery of it by the 2 leads who certainly bring chemistry to this thankfully unsentimental journey."
charlottevgl,"Jul 25, 2013",10/10,"This movie is kinda like your first love, you will never forget it or what it gave you, and when you realize it's over you just sit there numb and full of emotions, unable to actually fathom what just happened.I have rarely laughed so wholeheartedly or with my soul as much as I did when I watched this masterpiece of a movie. There are few characters, and the main focus are on two men, who very obviously come from two different life's and struggles, but develops a friendship I have never seen anything like on a movie screen. I almost have trouble describing what this beautiful story does to you. You feel like you wanna run down to the streets and hug a stranger and let them know that whatever they are facing in life that it's gonna be okey.The reason i LOVE this movie is because of the story and the people portraying the main characters. They have really done an excellent job both on the cast and the script. You can relate to the characters, they suck you in and you have no other option but to listen and laugh(and cry)with them. The story is unique and original, it touches you in ways you didn't think possible. Don't mistake this movie for a sob-story because it's anything but.If you haven't seen it, and think for a second you are not going to either - well then, the jokes on you. Because it doesn't matter where you are, who you are or what kind of situation you are in, it will bring light and love right smack into your little beating bloodbox."
Jithindurden,"Feb 3, 2018",7/10,The chemistry of the lead actors and the overall fun mood keeps us entertained and the intentional avoidance of some usual formula is a plus point. But the film never really rise much above that either which I had been led to believe from all the great reviews and ratings.
dbogosian-1,"Aug 15, 2013",9/10,"This is easily the best and most memorable movie I've seen in a very long time. Its formula is simple: the juxtaposition of two people from two radically different backgrounds who, with time, become the best of friends. And oddly enough, there isn't the initial suspicion or antagonism; they hit it off right away. But the relationship grows and deepens until they become inseparable.The real strength of the film lies in the characters and the men who play them. One is a sophisticated, literate, older white man who is paralyzed and confined to a wheelchair; the other a young, lanky, street-savvy black man with naught but the clothes on his back. They have such charisma, such chemistry, it is a tour de force from beginning to end. Particularly the younger man, whose infectious smile and boisterous humour keeps the mood light even in the darker moments.It's set in France, and you do have to endure subtitles (which are not well done; occasionally the punch line of a joke comes up too soon), but it's well worth it nonetheless. This is the first time I've seen a French film that didn't leave me depressed and suicidal by the end. I hope many more like it will follow."
AurelienA21,"Dec 15, 2012",9/10,"This is a truly excellent french film which highlights themes from love to comedy. I really enjoyed the music which went with the movie as it captured the mood of the (based on a true story) storyline. The main piece was Fly by Ludovic Einaudi. The actors play a splendid role to depict the life of the real paralysed man and real carer.I only watched this last night and i watched the original - in french. It is a very recent film filmed in Paris and i find this film suits any watcher for the reason that it contains both high-up, posh lifestyles compared to ""chavs"" smoking and speeding Maserati's. The Humour is captured best in the original version as i would imagine a few humorous jokes may not work in translated English. I Loved it."
metalpixies,"Sep 6, 2012",10/10,"I hadn't expected too much of this film because of the carer/wheelchair storyline. It just didn't sound very interesting. So I was pretty much astonished to find myself watching a truly marvellous and entertaining movie.It's a unique storyline which is apparently based on true life.The two guys at the centre of the plot keep bouncing jokes off each other leaving you in fits of laughter. But it's not just a comedy; there's a lot of sad, moving and beautiful stuff in there as well.Script, direction, filming and acting are all of the highest standard.This is a very sensitive treatment of human relationships; sad, funny and involving. It's simply a great movie. I can't recommend it highly enough."
TheSquiss,"Sep 20, 2012",8/10,"Intouchables / Untouchable **** 10 September 2012 I hate having to start like this but, based on the discontented grunts from the morons who walked out in the first minute, I regret I must begin with: Intouchables is a French film. Which means it's in FRENCH. Which means there are subtitles!!! Arrrggghhh.For the readers who actually have a brain, Intouchables (Untouchable for those who can't work it out) will almost certainly end the year as one of the most tender, beautiful films of 2012. Yes, it was released in France last year but this is no place for such pedantry.Intouchables is the true story of Phillipe (François Cluzet), a wealthy, aristocratic quadriplegic and his relationship with his caretaker-cum-care assistant, the reluctant, defiant Driss (Omar Sy). When Driss turns up for an interview at Phillipe's home it is with the sole intention of failing in order to qualify for unemployment benefit. Phillipe, however, sees in him a man who will challenge and inspire him and, much to the annoyance of Magalie (Spiral's Audrey Fleurot), hires him on the spot.And so begins a clash of culture, class and conduct from which both parties will surely emerge richer, softer and sharper.There are no surprises in the broad story; if a true-life tale is worthy of the big screen treatment, there's a very good chance it sticks to the formula, although don't dismiss Intouchables as merely formulaic. The surprise here is how effortlessly engaging, inspiring and downright funny it is. No, it isn't specifically a comedy but I laughed out loud more often and with less control than I have in any films billed as such this year so far.There's no great villain, no huge love story, no major tragedy, just a simple story of friendship where two men, though apparently diametrically opposed in every aspect, are absolutely meant to share their lives and have more in common and so much more to give each other then either could have considered.Cluzet, in a welcome return to British screens after last year's superb Little White Lies, is huggably dour as Phillipe with an outer crust and a rod up his backside that are begging to be shattered. Sy meanwhile, in his most prominent film for English-speaking audiences (other than a supporting turn in Micmacs), storms into frame with a demeanour that would make most of us back away and cover our throats. But though we get the measure of both men fairly quickly and there are no road-to-Damascus conversions, each of them evolves and when the inevitable tug at the heartstrings arrives, it brings a hollowness that you'll hope desperately can be filled. Soon.I really want to award Intouchables another couple of stars but it misses out on perfection for being too swift and not allowing itself the time to unveil the arcs of a couple of supporting characters that could have added greater depth to the film. Although we meet members of Diss' family at various points, there is another plot line with them that is never fully explored and there is more that occurs in Phillipe's household than we are allowed to fully enjoy.But these are minor quibbles. See it. See it before it disappears from your local screen. See it if The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel left you hankering after India, see it if The Chorus made your heart skip, see it if Oh, just go and see it. It's beautiful, warm and very, very funny."
tnt-tarun,"Dec 12, 2012",9/10,"Wow. That's all I can say about this movie. The fact that it's based on a true story is all the more amazing, and I immediately looked up the people the movie was based on as soon as it ended.Once in a while, a movie comes along that elicits emotions from deep within the heart. You don't know how it's going to end and you are smiling when the movie is over, wishing there was more. I usually don't laugh out loud while watching a movie but found myself doing so because even the jokes in this movie were so genuinely funny without being crass.Both the lead actors did a wonderful job. The chemistry between them can be felt and you really feel as if you are watching the story unfold in front of you and not on the screen. All the characters were well developed in their own roles and there were no loose ends (something most movies neglect to tie up).Watch this movie. You will surely recommend it to others as I am doing right now."
Prismark10,"Jun 9, 2019",6/10,"I was surprised by Untouchable. I did not think that a French film about a wealthy quadriplegic and his black working class carer would be a comedy. Instead I thought the film would be bogged down with race, cultural and class issues.Francois Cluzet who looks a lot like former F1 world champion Nigel Mansell plays Phillipe. A wealthy widowed aristocrat living in a fabulous Parisian mansion paralyzed from the neck down in a paragliding accident. He needs round the clock care and none of them last long.Philippe meets Driss (Omar Sy) who is of Senegalese origin. He only attends the job interview to get a signature so he can get his unemployment benefits. Despite being a small time criminal, Philippe likes his irreverence and verve and employs him.Driss is physically strong but he also brings Philippe to life as he drives him around in one of Philippe's fast cars rather than his adapted disabled friendly van. Driss's lack of stuffiness is exactly what Philippe needed.Untouchable is a feel good buddy comedy of two men from different tracks of life who bond. It is really a simple story based on true facts, although the real life carer was a French Arab. It is an engaging enough film despite its stereotypes. There is a scene where Driss steals a Faberge egg that was given to Phillipe by his late wife.The film decided to go for the funk feel of Earth, Wind and Fire. It helps that both stars have an easy chemistry together."
asda-man,"Apr 4, 2013",9/10,"Prepare yourselves for one of the most touching relationships ever brought to screen! Forget Fred and Ginger, forget Humphrey and Ingrid, because now it's all about Phillipe and Driss. Most French films I watch are nasty (but brilliant) shockers like Inside and Martyrs. Of course I've seen the odd gentler one like, I've Loved You So Long but even that's depressing. The funniest French films I've seen are Jean-Pierre Jeunet's, Amelie and Micmacs, but Untouchable just about betters both of them. It's not just one of the most funny and touching French films I've seen, but just films in general. Only a seriously bitter and cynical person could hate Untouchable.The film opens with wit and energy as we see Phillipe and Driss trying to out-run and out-smart the police for speeding. It's a funny and clever sequence and just a taste for the even more amusing shenanigans to follow. But of course we can't just jump into the middle of the film! We need what Midge calls, ""a flash-back"" so we can see how they got there. What Untouchable does so well is build up its characters so we can care about them. Driss comes from a working-class background, living in a tiny and over-crowded flat. He's also a thief and his Mum has kicked him out, and although Driss is a thief we can still care about him, especially as the film goes on and we see just how funny he is.Phillipe is the opposite. He's a hugely rich invalid with silly money to spend on paintings that look like ""a nosebleed"" as Driss puts it. But like magnets opposites attract. Driss is obviously attracted to his lavish quarters, already bigger than the whole flat he used to live in! The film takes time building up their relationships, as we see them bond through some very funny and touching moments. The directors make the audience feel as though we're bonding with them, so in a sense it's a three-way relationship and becomes all the more personal. Untouchable is also a comedy, there are some hilarious moments which I won't spoil, but it had me and the audience laughing pretty much all the way through.The directing is really well done, and I also really liked the music which made some touching scenes even more touching! It's no wonder that Untouchable was a huge hit in France, because it's such a light-hearted and entertaining film, yet is also quite memorable too, thanks to the wonderful performances, witty screenplay and classy directing. Untouchable is a sort of rom-com but Jennifer Anniston is no where in sight! It's one of those 'buddy movies' which shows a touching kind of platonic love similar to that of Rain Man. It's a relationship we can all relate to and care about the couple involved.Untouchable is a French classic and one I hope to watching in years to come. I defy anyone to watch and not to become involved in Phillipe and Driss' wonderful relationship. An endlessly funny and moving film which those with a sense of humour can enjoy. It's a wonderful feel-good film!"

The story not to mellow, and for some quiet reason it's just a nice movie like it's to good to be true or maybe it's just me but it's feels like that and the story is really cute but what I like the most is the character boundaries they have good chemistry, the chemistry seems not to deep or just like friends but they're more than just friends like i would simply say brother but they're not there yet..."
MichaelHur,"Feb 3, 2015",5/10,"Everybody said that this movie was awesome, so I gave it a shot.Iusually don't like France movies so I didn't expect a good movie, and I didn't get a good movie. The scenes escalated way to quickly. Why would the handicapped man want him to take care of him. The acting is either overacted or there is no act in the scenes. In short the acting is bad.The writing It's just off, awful, Scenes either contain Way to much information or no information at all, and that confused me a lot. It didn't feel realistic, I'm pretty sure no one would react like that in real life situation. My recommendation is not to watch this movie."
myungjahigh,"Mar 31, 2012",9/10,"In these days, in my country, the movie Intouchables is ranked very high in box office. Usually French films are not that popular or familiar in this country's movie industry. Therefore it is quite surprising to see that people are very eager to see Intouchables, a film from France. At first, it was not famous to people at all because promotions were not big for the movie. However, as time goes by, Intouchables is getting bigger and bigger. Almost every person who watched the movie tells to friends or writes review on the internet that Untouchables is a amazing film. And I think that is a real and successful marketing.I also watched it today, and I definitely recommend this film just like others did to me. So fun, moving, beautiful. While watching the movie, the audiences including me burst into laughter or tears for every single second. very priceless moment."
StevePulaski,"Jul 31, 2012",10/10,"Now here is a film that perfect defines the word ""wholesomeness."" The Intouchables is a moving parable about a wise but poor black man who becomes the caregiver and mentor for a wealthy tetraplegic in a series of unlikely but not unbelievable events in modern-day France. The film begins by showing the man's assistant, interviewing candidates for the job of being the man's hands and legs, but as the man sits close behind her, he becomes increasingly unsatisfied with the candidates due to their lack of motivation or their mundane nature.The man, named Philippe, played by François Cluzet, is brought to a smile when he is acquainted with Driss (Omar Sy), a man who has been through relentless struggles with money and social-status, but still manages to push through it with a smile. Driss is only looking for a signature on his unemployment checks so he can continue receiving welfare benefits and has absolutely no ambition to get this job.The next day, he is called up to begin the trial period as the role of Philippe's caretaker, and while Driss is clearly unqualified for a job of this nature, Philippe casually accepts him because he finds the man to be charming and good-natured. While both men come from the Parisian-area, Philippe lives in a heavenly mansion, while Driss inhabits the lowest end of the slums. Despite this setback, the men have an incredibly easy-going friendship, with deep, touching talks of inspiration and motivation throughout the picture. Subplots involve Driss demanding that Philippe maintain better control of his only daughter, Elisa, and trying to get the man back on his dating game with a digital lover.I'm aware the story sounds like cliché-after-cliché, but the film perfectly abides by my law of films with a seemingly cliché premise. The Intouchables knows its story functions with moments of incredulity and utter sappiness, but it doesn't try to overcompensate and milk those moments for more than they're worth. It also does more than give us contrivance, but inflates its moments of sentiment with wit, charm, attitude, style, and poignancy, making this for a very emotional experience on every level. Sometimes, we are greeted with a film we know is relatively simple, cliché, and unassuming, yet we are mesmerized unconditionally up until the final frame.The film became a colossal hit in France, selling over nineteen million tickets and is currently the second highest grossing film of all time, in France. Due to its very minimal promotion in the US, I could see some people going into this film expecting a somber, relatively monotone film depicting the life of a tetraplegic tragically and with a numbing aftertaste. The Intouchables has a talent much like the Alexander Payne film, The Descendants, which is depicting a relaxing environment, which includes making a character out of the setting, handling tragedy with a sustainable amount of poignancy, and providing touches of extremely funny comedy throughout its entire runtime.As of now, French cinema is one of the strongest cinemas in the world, as it has been for decades now. Rather than try to recreate the New Wave it experienced many years ago, try out a gimmicky, self-indulgent style, or even worse, replicate Hollywood formulas, it is at a stage now where it can take even the most basic storyline and rework it into a magnificent portrayal with humanity and lavishness subtly and majestically. The Intouchables is a beauty that will definitely be taken for granted.Starring: François Cluzet and Omar Sy. Directed by: Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano."
adambenjamingibbons,"Oct 2, 2019",10/10,"This is an amazing film of friendship and it is very funny.At its core it is about someone who wants to be treated normally who meets someone that treats him that way. They get on like a house on fire, have a few ups and downs and a whole lot of fun too.Everyone moaning about this film is banging on about stereotypes and racism. I don't care, it was a film, stereotypes come about for a reason, some people do fit the stereotype.Unless you're a mardi little overly PC snowflake then it's a must watch."
jtprint,"Nov 29, 2020",10/10,"A beautiful film, I laughed a lot with it, one of the best films I have seen in my life and one of the few that really deserves a 10/10, it must have won best international film in The Oscars. I feel that the central message would be friendship, understanding, compassion ... 100% recommended. And should be on the top 30."
Calicodreamin,"Jan 28, 2021",10/10,"This film instantly draws you in with a real emotional connection to the characters. There is a good mix of humor and reality. The storyline has good flow, great acting, and vivid cinematography. Overall a well made film."

The rapport gels from the moment they meet. The whole cast performance is delicious from beginning to end. I've probably watched this film 3 or four times a year, and still it moved me to tears at the end."

lastliberal-853-253708,"Jul 20, 2013",9/10,"From the moment I see François Cluzet and Omar Sy, I know I am going to love this film.Driss (Sy) is a homeless loser that is hired as a personal attendant to a quadriplegic (Cluzet). He is crude, insensitive, and incredibly funny with superb dialog by writer/directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano.Both Philippe (Cluzet) and Driss grow by leaps and bounds in the relationship that develops. Phillipe says that with modern medicine, he can live to 70. Who would want to live one more day as he is? Driss shows him how to really live no matter how long he has.Both men, and those around them, really start to live, and that is what makes this film so special."
selena5222222,"Nov 30, 2015",10/10,"This is the only film I manage to watch 3 times in 24 hours. I was so thrilled with the originality and humor that I couldn't stop watching and talking about it for days. Both characters are genuine, witty and original. Scenario has enough of intelligent humor and it is such a refreshment in the ocean of bad comedies. The film has the tragic note but also it shows we should use every moment of our life. The fact that the film was based on real persons and events makes it even more special. I would recommend it for every audience : each person can learn from the film. Its a story of life, love, daily problems, tragedy but it shows that we can change our perspective and experience the maximum. Also, it shows how two totally opposite people can build an amazing relationship. We just need to forget the prejudice we have about each other. I'm planning to watch it for the fourth time in short notice - that's how good the film is."
keithdonegan,"Dec 7, 2012",10/10,"A film that is so beautiful and sad at the same time, it really makes you think about everything: life, love, death and tragedy. I am a big fan of these type of 'minimalistic' movies and in particular, french film so this ticked all the boxes and I'm very glad I stumbled upon this.The movie grabbed me from the very start, it is a well made title that has a great story line, actors that fitted their roles perfectly, the production is top notch and don't get me started on the soundtrack. 10 out of 10.I won't go into too much depth but I absolutely loved the relationship between the main characters. They complimented each other very well together (you will understand when you watch it) and the other cast of the mansion too.Just a masterpiece for film lovers, please watch it."
Marchand_ryan,"Feb 23, 2013",10/10,"Knowing this movie had great ratings and reviews going in, I was hoping for something just enjoyable that I could agree with.After spending my time watching this film, I was smiling from ""ear"" to ear the entire time.Both characters come from a different neck of the woods but it's their friendship that blossoms into something more than words can explain.Art, Poetry, Friendship, Loneliness, & the Human Relationship is something that this movie goes over the top with.I highly recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a heart-warming story, a great film, or just something to enjoy to pass their time."
ThomasinWestHollywood,"Jul 3, 2022",N/A,"Inspiring film! We need more powerful consequential films for today. I would have thought that people who spend their working lives watching one violent film after the other punctuated by mindless horror, teenage pap and worse would find a film like Untouchable a pleasant antidote but that doesn't seem to be the case and the fact that it's all true - we learn in end captions that both men remain close - appears irrelevant. So much for hacks; the International public have already embraced it and it's more than likely the UK will follow. For many non-French audiences Francois Cluzet appeared on their radar first only six or seven years ago when Tell No One was an International hit. Jazz buffs had registered him as far back as 1986 when he co-starred with Dexter Gordon in 'Round Midnight' (coincidentally another 'true' story based on an unlikely friendship between American Jazz pianist Bud Powell and a young French fan). I personally have yet to see him give even a mediocre performance let alone a bad one; as for Omar Sy this is the first time I've heard his name. There are, of course, precedents for unlikely male bondings in fact Francis Weber, the French writer-director, specialized in the genre in such titles as Le Chevre, Les Compreres, Tais-Toi etc, Daniel Auteuil has also joined in at least twice (Mon meilleur ami, Apres Vous) and so on but despite it being well-worn Untouchables applies a new lick of paint to the genre and delivers a feel good title to remember."
amit_imt2002,"Jan 8, 2013",6/10,"A rich aristocratic Frenchman Philippe played by Francois Clouzet, who is quadriplegic is perpetually looking for a caregiver.He is a tough cookie and taking care of his fragile health and erratic temperament mean that most don't last more than a week.We see interviews happening.There is a train of inept candidates even we know won't last long.They already see Philippe as a dead man. In the middle of all this, in walks a giant of a black man.He is well built and full of raw energy.He does not want the job, just a signature attesting that he tried to find a job so he can qualify for social security.He is out on parole, a stock character from the Paris housing projects, the grim underbelly of which has been superbly documented in La Haine.We know immediately he will be hired.Its an immutable law of films, even if the posters and trailer have not given it away already.What follows are a set of adventures the two embark upon turning conventional wisdom on its head. Driss played by the gregarious Omar Sy, has immense physical energy and a love of life that is infectious, he has a mind of his own and is not cowed by the splendor of the mansion in which he finds himself in.Of course he tests the springiness of the mattress and practices his bathroom singing in a luxurious gold rimmed bathtub but those are not too important for him. Philippe indulges him, despite the protests of his friends, he trusts his instincts, probably his last act of rebellion against life which has suddenly been so unfair. The two are polar opposites but begin to share a bond.Phillip likes the fact that Driss does not treat him like a vegetable but a real human being even to the extent of making fun of his disability.If all this sounds like a series of clichés from many other films you are right.But then, cinema thrives on telling the same story again and again because our lives too follow predictable patterns, no matter how hard we try to assert our individuality.What ultimately matters is whether cinema is able to sweep us away in its arc and its joy of telling that story and makes us forget our own dull life. This is what this film does, takes an old premise and infuses raw energy in the narrative.Sy dominates the screen like a giant, his love of life and his refusal to become a part of the vicious cycle of the Parisian immigrant suburban housing estates which are a sad model of exclusion and ghettoisation, sets him apart.Driss shows Philippe a good time."
lee_eisenberg,"Jan 5, 2015",10/10,"Olivier Nakache's and Éric Toledano's ""Intouchables"" looks at the friendship between people of dissimilar backgrounds. Philippe (François Cluzet) is a paraplegic tycoon who hires African immigrant Driss (Omar Sy) to be his caretaker. That paragliding scene made me want to go paragliding.Beyond the obvious plot, I see the movie as a look at France's - and much of Europe's - growing diversity. Even if a person in France or Germany doesn't like immigrants, he's still bound to have exposure to them (much like how racist southerners in the US are going to have exposure to blacks whether they want it or not). Of course, most important is the different backgrounds that the men have: Philippe is a modern aristocrat, while Driss is from the ghetto. Both have something to teach each other.Anyway, it's a really good movie. I recommend it."
rahuldeep-37247,"Dec 18, 2024",7/10,"""The Intouchables"" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world."

Omar Sy and Francois Cluzet is the perfect choice of actors. What really touched me was the sort of honesty their relation proceeded in and that its not always the conventional way who is the best way to go, you always have to understand that all people are and should be treated as who they are and not by a manual.The change in Omar Sy,s character is wonderful to watch and he, well deserved, won a Cesar for hes performance.All the characters in the film are very likable and i strongly recommend this movie for all ages, this is a feel-good movie with a ll the right stuff in it!"
ferguson-6,"Jun 4, 2012",8/10,"Greetings again from the darkness. Sometimes acting elevates material to a level far beyond what a film might have otherwise deserved. Such is the case with this based-on-a-true-story effort from co-writers and co-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano. Despite the elements of truth, the core material here is a sentimental tale that we have seen before. Francois Cluzet (Tell No One) as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss turn it into an extremely entertaining story with characters we quickly connect with.Philippe is a wealthy quadriplegic widower who is interviewing candidates for a caregiver. Driss is a recently released from jail street hustler who is just trying to qualify for state benefits by going on the required interviews. Philippe is struck by Driss' direct approach and energy level, and chooses Driss over the room full of more qualified types.The rest of the movie is really a buddy flick where the polar opposites bring much to the other. Philippe slyly gets Driss to use his sharp mind a bit more effectively, and Driss taps into Philippe's hidden lust for life. Though the supporting cast is fine, the film's best scenes are those featuring Philippe and Driss.This is a film from France and much as been made of the filmmakers' decision to change the caregiver from the real life Arab to a more cinema-friendly Black man. The Earth, Wind & Fire dance may be a bit too much, but I choose to believe the casting of Omar Sy was the deciding factor, not his race. He lights up the screen and draws us right into his world and his choices - some of which are better than others.The film shares much with The Sea Inside, Scent of a Woman, and The Diving Bell and the Butterfly, but this one has much more humor and bonding than any of those. It doesn't shy away from the melodramatic moments and isn't above trying to generate tears in viewers. There will be a US re-make of this one, but the two lead actors here (especially Mr. Sy) make this one worth seeing."
DICK STEEL,"Dec 23, 2012",10/10,"Just as how Jack Neo's Ah Boys to Men Part 1 finally took over the box office crown held by Money No Enough more than a decade ago, so did Intouchables take over the French box office equivalent from the quirky comedy Amelie, which was the champ over about the last decade. As the French entry for the Oscar's Best Foreign Film picture next year, I was glad I held out against watching this while on a flight, patiently waiting for it to make its big screen bow here, which it finally did outside of the 2nd Rendezvous of French Cinema earlier this month.There were many moments that made it so easy for me to identify with the movie, especially coming from caregiving, which is never an easy thing to do. Those who have never done it, I'm talking about full time, real time, on the job alertness, and doing everything you can to make things comfortable for the other party. There's no Off button you can use, and anyone in this for full time employment, gets my utmost respect. And watching how the characters here go about their routine, bring back memories that are forever dear to me, and needless to say, these routines and close contact interaction, bring about a new level in relationships.Lifting someone up from bed in back-breaking fashion, it brings new meaning to ""He ain't Heavy, He's my Father"". Tucking someone into bed. Did that too. The gloves for the toilet visit, nothing new, gross that it may be at first. Wheeling someone out to soak in sights and sounds outside of one's home, well, it may be the most inconvenient, but seeing someone's face light up for the rare trip out, is priceless. And these life-affirming, relationship building events may seem to stem from mundane tasks, and tasks we take for granted, such as bathing or just sheer presence to interact without distraction, but to the physically infirm, it means the world.And this is what The Intouchables is about, the story of two men thrown together by fate in what would be an employer-employee relationship that develops into firm friendship, a bromance even if you'd like. Inspired by a true story, Francois Cluzet plays the rich aristocrat Philippe, who is quadriplegic from the neck down from a paragliding accident, and has to rely on an army of helpers and assistances to get through every day. But his primary caregiver never lasts more than a week, given his rather stiff (pardon the pun) ways, until Driss (Omar Sy), a young man with not the most polished resume - he responded to the ad just to chalk up mileage to get welfare - gets hired despite verbally crossing swords during the interview, and soon, a bet turns into what's life-changing for them both, bringing out the best in each other.You can half expect writer-directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's story to contain the usual clash of cultures and background, with one refined in the arts and the other being quite the rough and gruff, obviously no time to enjoy the finer things in life when one has to worry about bringing home the bacon for an extended family, with trouble brewing when members trying to stay in line with the law. But their story is tinged with so much sensitivity and truth, that it's hard to quibble with the loads of humanity on display, going by the adage that one shouldn't judge a book by its cover, or by one's background or resume. One may be rich, but getting someone else to wait on you, even if providing him or her with a comfortable life, is a different ballgame altogether, especially when one is not kin or kith.But throughout the story, one cannot deny that life can still go on quite comfortably in a material way, with wealth on display, and if there's a minor grouse about this, is how old money gets flaunted around, with Meseratis and private jets being part of the arsenal to enjoy life. Then again, this is part of the true tale, so it's not debatable. Not forgetting the extended ensemble cast of assistants in the form of Yvonne (Anne Le Ny) and Magalie (Audrey Fleurot) amongst others who pepper the scenery, the former serving to fill in the blanks for Driss as he tries to gather background, while the latter coming in as an object for Driss' romance, with a little surprise up in store.There's no qualms The Intouchables is a delight to sit through, being a story of hope and friendship. And in some ways, even for the most able amongst us, this is a tale that reminds us of the importance of humour, which is medicine enough to get us through some of the toughest situations we'll encounter from time to time. Both Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy put in amazing performances, and their delivery of their characters, screen charisma and banter, are more than reasons enough to catch this. A definite recommendation!"
hassnawi2111,"Apr 13, 2012",9/10,"My wife was frightened when I was suddenly burst laughing at Omer Sy's spontaneous acting scenes. I enjoyed watching this masterpiece. Omar Sy is a great actor and he deserves an Oscar for his role in this movie. I found Omar Sy's role much more challenging and unusual than Jean Dujardin's... of course, few people make silent films today, but the character itself was incredibly stereotypical. As for The Intouchables, I really liked the film and found it entertaining and thoughtful at the same time .The chemistry between the two leads is wonderful. Not quite as insufferably retro as it sounds, the formulaic film gets a boost from the endearing performances of its leads — particularly Sy, whose ex-con-turned-servant instructs his cultured boss on the pleasures of '70s soul classics and pot-smoking before cleaning up nicely. The racial politics remain as sketchy as the sitcom-style jokes, and Harvey Weinstein smells a hit, having bought both the movie and, alas, the rights to remake."

This is the best movie I have seen in years and it made me laugh, it made me sad, it made simply a better person I can say. I will say I was little skeptic at the beginning because I usually watch American/English movies mostly and I usually don't like non-English movies, I found them almost every time boring and I lose interest very soon, but this one kept me watching without a brake. Its just a WONDERFUL story about friendship and courage of two men that came from totally different backgrounds, but they fit together in this movie PERFECTLY. I gotta say Omar Sy performance was Oscar worthy, he was just great, he made me laugh through the whole movie and he was incredible, and François Cluzet, what can I say about him, he was just great, playing such hard role, I think no one would have done better job then him. Two of them together carried the whole movie and made it PERFECT. The story was based on true events and I believe that fact made the movie even better because it has one thing that most other movies don't have and that is REALITY. When I think about this movie and these two guys and I realize somewhere in the world they exist it makes so happy I just want to be a better person, better friend, better man...So if you ask me this movie is MUST SEE, believe me you will not regret it..."
albanr,"Aug 16, 2012",7/10,"The critiques in Metascore did not do their homework. They qualify the film as a feel-good fairy tale, which means they completely miss the point that it is a true story. The latter point and the unusual real life story are the reasons behind the huge success. Yes, it was filmed with actors but the real life protagonists vetted every point and the final product was not cooked and edited the ""Hollywood"" way to please audiences as it did not need to be. We are not talking about a recipe- based product here. The lazy American critiques watch too many American commercial romantic comedies and other ""romanticised"" genres to even suspect this was a true story...so, shame on the critiques of this film.You should see this film because the feel-good you come out of seeing it, is not made up."

Oh my God, I'm weeping right now, while I write these lines... NOT! This film is pathetic and the only way to explain the high ratings and its success is through the fact that most people are easily touched by stories that are sentimental and about friendship and moral values. Similar to why Paulo Coelho's books are bestsellers, for example.To compare: Little Britain's Lou and Andy are funny exactly because they are not trying to teach you a moral lesson or show you how important it is to have a friend or help someone.Simple story. Cliché. Sentimental. Boring."
jackie-barchilon,"Sep 1, 2012",10/10,"I've never submitted a review before, but this was absolutely outstanding. The dialogue is excellent, with many unexpected responses, especially in the beginning. The characters are exceptional, especially in their social contrast--but when the inevitable social comparisons are made, they are either handled with genuine surprize, or else expertly buffooned. Some of the obvious exchanges are handled so well, and so unexpectedly that there are guffaws from the audience. The story is wonderfully touching, without any syrup. That it is a true story makes it even more surprizing and appealing. I don't know which other contemporary movie I would rate a perfect 10. Well done."

Now its one of my favorite movie . brilliant acting by every one of them not too much sentiment or comedy. My rating is 10/10 . this is one of the movie you should watch before you die..! Thanks to its strong cast and some remarkably sensitive direction,A movie or rather true story of two men who should never have met--a quadriplegic and a street con.François Cluzet as Philippe and Omar Sy as Driss make you sit tight on chair for the whole movie because it's a plausible enchantment."
fliesbeth,"Aug 28, 2012",10/10,"Just saw the movie now and I'm just blown away.This movie manages to make you go really quiet at times and laugh out loud 5 minutes later.From the very beginning until the last minute I enjoyed every bit of this beautiful story.The actors are perfectly cast and just simply amazing. Before I started watching I was a little bit afraid the story would be too sentimental and corny and too 'American', but nothing is less true. What I loved about the movie is that the director and the actors just bring you the story without laying it on too thick and obviously trying to work on your emotions or spelling it out like you're an idiot. I don't know how else to explain it, it's just a wonderful movie. You must see this one, that's all I can say.Must watch!"
josh71983,"Sep 29, 2012",10/10,"To be honest I didn't even know this was a foreign film, till I started watching. I saw it on IMDb's best since 2011 list and decided to give it a shot.This was a fantastic story that was portrayed brilliantly. It left me smiling nearly the whole movie.Any person that just likes a good story about life, friendship, hardship, and man overcoming his fears(no matter how small), this is a movie for you.still smiling...:)"
powell-yendi,"Mar 21, 2014",10/10,"I have been so annoyed by movies about miserable black people from the ghetto who are transformed by sweet, gentle Caucasians. Finally, the roles have been reversed! Finally the media is graced with a movie about a miserable Caucasian who is transformed by a sweet, gentle black person from the ghetto. I love to see the underdog maintain a positive outlook, a childlike exuberance, and an optimistic approach that is contagious. Yes, ""The Blind Side"" had a similar theme, but ""The Intouchables"" supersedes it, because a black person from the ghetto does not need to be mentally delayed to have a good heart. I recommend this movie to all those who don't mind reading captions for a good story. The acting was phenomenal and the fact that it is a true story just enhances the beauty of this movie."
Jonathon_Natsis,"Nov 24, 2012",8/10,"Feel-good French film The Intouchables tells the true story of the burgeoning friendship between an old, aristocratic invalid and his young, impoverished caretaker. Sounds pretty lame, doesn't it? It sounds like the kind of film that, at some point, seems destined to travel down one of two paths, descending either into a lecture on the class differences between certain socioeconomic groups or a comparison between the relative hardships of near-poverty and living with a severe disability.And therein lies the excellence of this film. Not only does it avoid both topics and, in so doing, keeps itself from becoming overly melodramatic, but it actually subverts audience expectations by persistently looking, as those Monty Python boys suggested, on the bright side of life. A big part of the film's charm is the effortless interplay between Omar Sy (caretaker Driss) and Francois Cluzet (Philippe), who clearly have a lot of fun with their roles while concurrently displaying total immersion in their characters.If managed poorly by directors Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, Driss's avalanche of one-liners and practical jokes at the expense of his handicapped friend could've come off as misplaced and in poor taste. However, the acting pair's wit and comic timing turns virtually all hit-or-miss jokes into gold and contributes greatly to making The Intouchables...well...just plain funny.In the same way that 'fun for the whole family' has comes to be interpreted as 'a living hell for anyone over six' by contemporary viewers, the classification of a 'dramedy' has come to imply a meagre handful of humour, quickly pushed aside to make room for a sob story. The Intouchables gets the formula right, injecting varied forms of comedy in between a genuine, emotionally investing subplot involving the lovelorn Philippe's pen pal Eleonore (Dorothee Briere). A toe-tapping soundtrack brimming with disco classics serves as the icing on the cake for this potentially Oscar-winning delight.*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review. If you're looking for a writer for your movie website or other publication, I'd also love to hear from you.*"
FilmCriticLalitRao,"Oct 20, 2014",6/10,"The concept of popular cinema has undergone considerable change in France. In the past, it was a device used by film journalists to define films made by directors namely Gérard Oury, Georges Lautner, Claude Zidi etc. In recent times, one sees a new breed of directors especially Dany Boon, Michel Munz, Thomas Gilou etc whose films have had tremendous commercial success. The team of Eric Toledano and Olivier Nakache is a new entrant to this group. Their film ""The Intouchables"" can be classified as a 'feel good' film with elements of 'popular cinema'. It sacrifices its elements of realism to portray an imperfect world of ""the haves"" and the ""haves not"" through the depiction of how black people are somewhat forced to live in suburbs whereas their friends live in expensive areas of Paris. As a character study of people from different areas, it shows why only a handful of black people are able to mingle with white people. ""Intouchables"" has broken all box office records in France as it honestly portrays a poor man's entry in the life of a rich man."

It never once veered from the storyline. Everything flowed well from start to finish.Throughout this movie you will laugh, expect true laughter. The music was wonderfully matched and was not overpowering.Usually one shy's away from predictability as we yearn for a mental challenges, especially through movies, truly this was not the case as you would not expect such touching representation.Congratulations to all involved!"

MrAkimbo,"Nov 16, 2014",9/10,"Rare do you watch a film where the energy just bounces off the screen leaving you with a warm glow. I felt after watching this movie one of those life affirming moments - a clear summer sky where the clouds are full, loaded with health and the warm light that seems to last forever showing off the land about you typical of summer evenings.This 'glow' is because the principal casts are excellent. I cannot direct a negative to any of the casts, pinpoint a scene where the acting was forced or lacking in motivation. Omar Sy is infectious as a performer. He struts. He dominates with his energy. Whoever cast him deserves praise, as he is the right balance between cock sure attitude and understanding. Francois Cluzet pedigree dates back decades, and his assured but restrained performance is the right level of rebound compared to Sy's exuberance. Trust in a maestro to deliver a seasoned performance. It would be easy - and a major oversight - to read the synopsis about the movie and believe the subject matter depressing. Funny, moving, idiosyncratic, unexpected, real, intimate, soul praisingly positive, and many other adjectives could be used to describe this excellent film.I stumbled upon this movie knowing little of its release or background, and its a gem of a film. One of them films you watch and yell, 'yesssss to life'.The fact that its based on a true story is inspiring in itself. The production value fulfilled the necessary parts to realise a wonderful and life inspiring story, achieving for once, the medium of film to rank in the spheres of great art. An aesthetic tonic for the soul."
limnashali,"Dec 14, 2012",10/10,"This movie just flows. The friendship, the warmth, the feel good factor, all of it sums up The Intouchables. How awesome should a movie be if someone can give a rating of 10 by just reading the subtitles?It takes you right into the story without much ado.The acting is excellent as well as the cinematography. The emotional connect is a very important factor in any movie. This film gets full marks for the emotional connection it is able to make with the audience. Rather than seeing it, we actually feel it. The comic moments are also handled very well. It makes us laugh but the thread of the story is never fiddled with.This is my first French movie and I am not disappointed. I recommend everyone to watch this flick as it is worth the 2 hours."
jblayton-51094,"Oct 3, 2025",N/A,Beautiful story. Beautiful soundtrack and score. Beautiful filmmaking. Beautiful script. Beautiful performances. One of the best films ever made. There is a CRIMINALLY high amount of people who have never even heard of this movie before. It's easily one of my favorite movies ever made. Driss is the perfect picture of a friend. The chemistry between each and every actor in this movie is unreal. Do yourself a favor and watch it. You will not regret it.
K3nzit,"Jan 4, 2020",7/10,"Great acting & good story. No masterpiece, but I enjoyed it a lot."
lifenharsha,"Jun 5, 2013",9/10,"The movie revolves around 2 people, a quadriplegic aristocrat and a black guy hired as his care taker. The movie showcases the turmoil, a quadriplegic faces in his life and shows how little things in his life bring about great joy. It also stresses on the point that how the small things we generally ignore, provide with relief n happiness in times of adversity when focused upon.The acting in the movie is brilliant. Francois Cluzet has given an outstanding performance as the quadriplegic. As far as Omar Sy is considered, I couldn't say he was acting at all. It was as though I was actually seeing things happen in real life as they unfold. He was deeply in character and has delivered an award winning performance.Overall, the movie is thought provoking one, rich in emotion n detail. I give it a 8/10."

dharmendrasingh,"Oct 4, 2012",8/10,"After missing last year's 'The Help' on principle (the principle being: black people have moved on; why can't Hollywood?), I couldn't help but approach 'Untouchable' with similar trepidation. My preconception was a misconception: It is one of the best films I've seen all year, and is by far the best foreign one. It's about platonic love between polar opposites. It's about hope and happiness.Set in Paris, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano's heart-warming film stars François Cluzet (a dead ringer for Dustin Hoffman) as Philippe, a wealthy quadriplegic widower and Omar Sy as Driss, a brutish ex-offender from a Parisian project.Looking for someone who will not pity him, Philippe hires Driss as his carer. Driss almost leaves until he sees his lavish quarters – and Magalie, Philippe's sexy auburn-haired secretary, who Driss makes it his mission to bed. Driss does pity Philippe, but never makes the mistake of showing it. Instead, the two make jokes at each other's expense and a bond very quickly (and believably) develops. They introduce each other to their worlds. One is replete with operas, art and literature; the other with girls, spliffs and street knowledge. By the end of the film they are inseparable.This could easily have been a tale of race, like 'The Help' was, but that is inconsequential in this film. It is purely coincidental that Philippe is white and Driss is black. When Philippe's personnel look disapprovingly at Driss, they do so because of his rough manner, not his colour. One of the film's strengths is that it doesn't mention this detail, which is after all as irrelevant as it being set in France. One thing that ought to be mentioned is that Omar Sy is not just the help in this film; he's the star, commanding the screen with confidence, charm and credibility.What cautions me from classing this as a perfect film is the few but prominent clichés. Philippe has a daughter who's so much the stereotypical spoiled little girl, and Driss's own family hates him. Also, the setups are overly familiar. Driss scoffs at Philippe's love for classical music and abstract art, but then learns to love Vivaldi and Bach, and then, astonishingly, creates a painting of his own which sells for 11,000 euros! This film is based on real people (Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his carer Abdel Sellou), so these things may be accurate, but this isn't a documentary of their actual lives.However, I can easily forgive these clichés because they are outnumbered by the many wonderful laugh-out-loud moments. Returning from a hiatus, Driss insists on shaving an unkempt Philippe. He snips away leaving Philippe looking more absurd upon each stroke, leaving him with a hitlerian moustache!Already 'Untouchable' has achieved a phenomenal level of success. It is making and breaking records across the globe, and is beating such films as 'The Artist' to awards. It has rightly been entered as France's entry for next year's Oscars. It is sure to win.www.moseleyb13.com"
camelia-chollet,"Dec 5, 2012",10/10,"One of my favourite films is THE INTOUCHABLES with the famous actor Omar Sy who became popular because of the TV show 'SAV'. A wonderful and emotional story about Philippe, a rich quadriplegic who requires a live-in caregiver.One the plus side, the movie is funny and sensitive at the same time. In this role Omar keeps his trademark hilarious attitude. He gets the job to work for Philippe, played by 'Francois Cluzet'.Philippe loves Cedric's behaviour and attitude (Omar Sy) because he treats him like a normal person without mercy or sympathetic. In this movie you will discover a story of love and close friendship.Moreover, this movie is taken from a true story which make the plot even more real and attractive.Go and see this film. You won't be disappointed."
Jory1993,"Oct 29, 2014",10/10,"The Intouchables is an amazing movie/experience for anyone to partake in.Whether you have a great and easy life, or a sad and hard one, this movie will help you to find the in-between. Laugh, love, cry, and feel connected to each and every character.This movie is a diamond in the rough. Where so many movies have failed to show every aspect within living with disability, whether it be yours or someone else's, this movie delivers it flawlessly. With laughter, it will bring you in. Then you start to see the realism of this world within disability.So beautiful. So heartfelt . So sad. So funny. So perfect.I strongly recommend this movie to all of society."
madisonlboehm,"Dec 1, 2018",10/10,"Truly a masterpiece; The Intouchables is a heartwarming and heartfelt story of a remarkable and true friendship between a quadriplegic and his aid. With some genuine laughs and thoughtful drama thrown in, The Intouchables is a touching movie that will leave you will the feel goods for a long time to come."
Playbahnosh,"Jul 13, 2012",9/10,"Okay, so my first concern why I didn't want to watch The Intouchables was the story itself. Like it was scavenged from a Hollywood studio's thrash can: ""A disgustingly rich quadriplegic guy hires a down-on-his- luck young man from the projects to be his personal aid. The cool dude shows the stuck up old man how to have fun and in return the rich guy teaches him about arts, manners and whatnot. Initially they have a few quarrels that mostly derives from the social, racial and age difference (and that the man is actually paralyzed from the neck down) but in the end they grow close and live happily ever after."" That really sounds like something Hollywood might cook up. Like Scent of a Woman or Flawless.But here's the catch: This movie is based on true events. Not in the sense as Titanic for example, where the only historically accurate fact was that ""the ship sunk"". It really how it happened in real life as depicted in this movie. Philippe Pozzo Di Borgo (the real life billionaire who this movie is about) personally oversaw the making of this movie to make sure it depicted the story of him and Abdel Sellou (his aid) as realistically as possible. Sure, they took a little artistic license here and there, but it's mostly accurate.The thing about cripples and terminally ill patients is that most people don't know how to handle them. Dr. House said it best in the series, that once people know you have cancer, from then on everything will be about cancer. People will feel obligated to feel sorry for you 24/7. They will be overly attentive, overly helpful to the point of annoying and will be really careful about how they talk to you. They will never ever just be themselves around you. Even if you've accepted your condition a long time ago, and sometimes you just wanna forget your debilitating disease, you'll be reminded every single time by these people who cannot NOT see the cripple or the person with the death sentence when they look at you.What this movie offers is a unique insight into a relationship that defies this. Driss is brash, brazen and completely disregards the notion of feeling sorry for Phillip. He acknowledges the fact that he is a quadriplegic, and he slowly learns to take care of him, but he seemingly refuses to be the gloomy oh-I'm-so-sorry kind of hypocrite society wants him to be. Instead, he makes fun of Phillip's condition on many occasions making even Phillip himself laugh. He introduces a fresh and invigorating energy into Phillip's life, which makes him see the world in a new light. Instead of wallowing in the sad and painful past, he starts to look to the future, take chances and make the best of what he can of what he still has.All in all, The Intouchables was a really positive surprise. It's not a perfect movie but it's a perfect story."
gigicottrell,"Aug 18, 2013",N/A,"This went straight into my top 3 films ever seen, just such an evocative and believable storyline, and masterfully crafted as only French films are. There is an inexplicable beauty to some French films, such as Amelie and ""Untouchable"" was of the ilk but so much more powerful given the context and nature of the two main characters. I cannot recommend this enough, I saw it alone, then took my 15 yr old son who also found it moving and wonderful, Nd then saw it with my boyfriend, whose 30 yrs as a hospital doctor have made him harder and more cynical than I, but he too was moved by this delightful, lighthearted approach to what many would see as a tragic story, and is raving about it to his friends too. I cannot recommend it enough it is a 10/10 without a doubt and it is an absolute travesty that it has not received the acclaim it deserves."
HelenMary,"May 27, 2013",7/10,"Amusing heartwarming drama about a quadriplegic millionaire who looks for a carer, but all the ""professional"" applicants are condescending, unfeeling and all about their paper qualifications and academic knowledge reducing Philippe (Francois Cluzet) to an object. Driss (Omar Sy) is at the interview just to get Benefits but his irreverence and dismissive laissez faire attitude actually meant that he treated Philippe like a person. A heartwarming relationship grows with it's ups and downs, bringing in more about each of their pasts and hopes for the future.The film is simply filmed, with a witty and gripping script (subtitled into English), which isn't lost in translation. The actors Cluzet and Sy were brilliant in their respective roles with Cluzet brilliantly portraying quadriplegic, only able to move his head and face, but his acting is a commitment to trust in that he has to remain still and inflexible. Sy was exuberant, fun and wild but also showing sensitivity and well-portrayed comic-stupidity. There's music, art and dancing, love and sexuality, fast cars, adrenalin sports, laughs a-plenty but also desperation, struggle and prejudice.It's well acted but whilst the plot is based on a true story, and has something for everyone in true 'underdog makes good' or 'Rainman-esque' style, the screenplay is lacking something. I'm not sure what it is, I think perhaps it's that there are holes in the characters, and in the plot and you are left with questions; you feel it's going to go a certain way... I expected more with Philippe's daughter 'Uncle Buck' style but liked how Driss lightened the mood of the house and brought joy and friendship to the story but ultimately there was something unfulfilled with his character, there wasn't enough depth and finish. I felt that use of Driss played to stereotypes, especially finding out that the original carer wasn't from Senegal but North Africa/Morocco and I wonder whether the story was exaggerated for the screenplay.I liked this film a lot, highly watchable and enjoyable and a very good cinematic experience. I can see why this was lauded but it's not particularly original and did play to stereotypes and didn't feel exactly finished. I was glad I saw it though, and it is apparently France's second most successful film after Welcome to the Sticks. A wonderful soundtrack, the Chamber Orchestra scene was great."
jeanette-ye,"Dec 22, 2012",10/10,"This movie is brilliant. It is about two men from different background, interest, class, and culture developing a close friendship and lighting up each other's world.It touches your heart, it is not emotional but it takes you on an amazing emotional ride about what it means to be human, dealing with the tragics in life, the things we feel helpless about, anger, fear, passion, love, beauty, intellect, and hope.It leaves you feeling a mixed of emotions and just speechless.It is sooooo real, and using Driss's favourite quote, it is ""pragmatic"" and it is life.It is also entertaining and funny, from the beginning to the end. The music is amazing, and love the irony about art.Very smart indeed!!!"
talexander12599,"Jul 29, 2015",7/10,"The Intouchables is a French comedy/biography from 2011 and stars François Cluzet (Tell No One, Little White Lies, French Kiss) and Omar Sy (X-Men Days of Future Past, Jurassic World, Samba). It was written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano (Samba, Those Happy Days, Tellement proches).This film is about a quadriplegic millionaire named Philippe (François Cluzet) who hires a lower-class man from the projects called Driss(Omar Sy). With help from Driss, Philippe finds humour in his situation and Driss reminds him how to appreciate life again through setting him up on dates, listening to funk music and even giving him a joint.This film is propelled by the performances by François Cluzet and Omar Sy. François gives his performance purely through dialogue and facial movements. Surprisingly he gives a great performance filled with emotion and humour. Omar Sy plays an incredibly likable character who can really make you laugh at points and at others make you feel very compassionate about his issues. Whenever the two are on screen together it is gold. I would compare their chemistry to those of buddy cop movies although this relationship is a lot deeper.Another aspect of this film that I admired was the dialogue. Since there is no real plot other than the story of two men, the film is carried by a lot of good dialogue. For example, when the two are looking at a piece of art, Philippe asks Driss why he thinks people are interested in art, Driss replies with because it's a business when Philippe tells him it's because it's the only thing one leaves behind.This film is basically the French version of Driving Miss Daisy, that is not to say this film is bad. This film's strongest points are writing and acting, but after that it's pretty thin. Directing or cinematography isn't anything special and the piano soundtrack sounds like something that would be added to an amateur short film. Yet this is still a heartwarming film it seems like it is a little overrated."
anderssonvilma-36677,"Apr 26, 2022",1/10,"Not my type at all! Have seen it too many times and it honestly gets worse each time. The first time I saw it, I have to admit it was an ok movie. But after having to watch it more than once, I've realised that there's not really that much going on in it at all."
gradyharp,"Mar 7, 2013",10/10,"Films such as THE INTOUCHABLES come around far too seldom and when they do the public should somehow be advised that here is a cup of magic that could alter the manner in which we relate to each other and to the world tainted by schisms of societal errors. Written and directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano the film was inspired by the true story of Philippe Pozzo di Borgo and his caregiver Abdel Sellou, discovered by the directors in 'A la vie, à la mort', a documentary film. Of note, the book version of the film's story was written and released after the film enjoyed great success. Written by Abdel Sellou the book 'You Saved My Life' tells the extraordinary true story of the charming Algerian con-man' friendship with a disabled French aristocrat. Sellou's book shows the real man behind Sellou/Driss's smiling face. The book takes us from his childhood spent stealing candy from the local grocery store, to his career as a pickpocket and scam artist, to his unexpected employment as a companion for a quadriplegic. Sellou has never before divulged the details of his past. In many interviews and documentaries, he has evaded or shrugged off the question of his childhood and his stay in prison, until now. He tells his story with a stunning amount of talent, with humor, style, and--though he denies that he has any--humility. Abdel Sellou now lives in Algeria with his wife and three children, where he runs a chicken farm. He remains close to Philippe Pozzo di Borgo, who lives in Morocco with his second wife and two children.The cinematic version of this relationship is an irreverent, uplifting comedy about friendship, trust and human possibility. After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident the aristocratic intellectual Parisian millionaire Philippe (François Cluzet) is interviewing candidates for the position of his caretaker with his secretary Magalie (Audrey Fleurot). Out of the blue, the rude ex-con African Driss (Omar Sy) cuts the line of candidates and brings a document from the Social Security and asks to Philippe to sign it to prove that he is seeking a job position to receive his unemployment insurance. Philippe, impressed that Driss is the only candidate who does not look at him with pity, challenges Driss and offers a period of adaptation of one week to him to gain experience helping him. Then Driss would decide whether he would like to stay with him or not. Driss accepts the bet and moves to the mansion, changing the boring life of Philippe and his employees, especially under the watchful and compassionate eye of the head of the house staff Yvonne (Anne Le Ny). As Driss reluctantly learns to move, feed, and clean Philippe, the two men discover a blunt but vital humor that not only bridges the cultural and class divide between them, but gives Philippe a renewed joy in life - and a chance to turn his passionate epistolary relationship with one Eleanore whom he has never seen into a chance at a second go at life.The only aspect of this film that is somewhat distracting is that the film opens with a car adventure involving both Philippe and Dris which is terrific film making and very funny but does make the film's beginning (after the credits) seem less surprising. A very minor point, especially when the film ends with the same activity but this time drives it to an incredibly touching completion. Highly recommended on every level: both François Cluzet and Omar Sy are brilliant!Grady Harp"
christian-tesfaye,"Jul 24, 2013",9/10,"Their is a reason why this movie is rated higher than Lawrence of Arabia or 2001, just for the same reason the Shawshank Redemption is rated higher than Citizen Kane and the godfather. Because this is a movie about hope, love, patience....and all the characteristics we all hope we have. And what's wrong with that???The movie is about two people who can not be any more different. One has his health, he is tall, strong and playful but no money and education what so ever. The other has all the money in the world but everything below his neck is paralyzed, he is reserved in manner. After they meet they quickly connect. It is as if they both find, in each other, the things they have been craving for a long time.The movie was a hit with audiences when it came out but it is not that popular with critics because according to them it is too stereotypical. Well i don't agree with that one bit. I thought the movie handles all the moral issues very correctly. I was also sad to learn that this movie wasn't even nominated for a best foreign language film award, it is such a shame. Anyways, if you haven't seen this movie please do, because it is one of those movies that make you feel good from the very inside.As for the technical stuff, i thought everything was spot on. the movie is put together in a way that makes you wonder if their even is anyone behind the camera which is a good thing because it shows how the actors are so natural in their rolls."
Bill-stricker,"Feb 24, 2013",10/10,"This is a don't miss film if there ever was one! Any age will find this film to be one of the best films they have seen in years. Even teenagers, who typically only want to see action films, will be drawn to this film. One does not even remember the film was subtitled. This is the story of a quadriplegic who continually needs to find new caregivers because of how badly he treats them. He finally finds the most improbable candidate and hires him. This begins a fantastic and very funny relationship that kept me spellbound for the whole movie, as it did the entire audience. When it ended, the audience all clapped loudly. See this movie if you want to laugh a lot and if you appreciate the development of a true, unique friendship."
Searsino,"Mar 18, 2017",10/10,"This was one of the first titles I watched after taking a deep dive into the foreign film market. And as a result, I have never looked back in the endless search for more and more ""foreign hidden gems"".The Intouchables is a movie which comes out of France. A passionate story directed by Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano which ultimately would become one of the most successful French films to ever hit the box office. You may also know there work from another film titled Samba, another hit which also starred Omar Sy (has also played several smaller roles such as Barry in Jurassic World - 2015).The general premise is that Philippe has been a lifelong paraplegic who is searching for an everyday caretaker to help him with menial tasks such as showering, shaving, eating, and any inconveniences that he may encounter on a given day. Driss happens to apply for the job, desperately in need of a new source of income. While many would have tossed aside Driss on his past alone (criminal record and seemingly never ending impatience for people), Philippe wants a person who will look at him as more than a handicapped man. He wants a friend and someone who will treat him like he is just as capable as the next.I quote a line from the film where Philippe is approached by a colleague who is concerned that hiring someone like Driss, a person with a rough background:Colleague: These street guys have no pity. Philippe: That's what I want.Antics ensue.I claim this to be one of my favorite films and gems for several reasons:1) The chemistry between the two leads, Omar Sy and François Cluzet is perfection. You truly believed these two individuals from polar opposite upbringings had becomes the closest of friends having discovered the beauty and benefits had from learning about one another. And quite frankly, chemistry of this magnitude is a rarity in film nowadays.2) The imagery was beautiful. Every scene from the nights at dinner or concerts, visiting private art galleries together, snowball fights (that humor could be drawn from having a snowball fight with a paraplegic speaks volumes), Driss helping Philippe with his everyday health needs, all the way to merely feeling like he's just a normal person who also wants to have fun once in a while.3) The story was told in such a way that keeps us wanting more. Both directors cleverly scatter humor throughout in order to offer the viewer some relief from the dark drama which is drawn out of these two characters with equally different struggles and rough pasts.I think what ultimately made this entertaining for me was thus: in situations where you have a helpless or handicapped lead (in this case a paraplegic), the first thing I wanted was for a physically capable person to stand up for them in situations where the other is not able to do so themselves.For example, early on in the film we are shown a situation where Philippe has a neighbor who constantly parks in the front of his drive way. It clearly bothers him but he can't do anything besides wait for the ignorant guy to move out of the way. Driss is now Philippe's right hand man, and upon recognizing the situation, jumps out of the car and gets in the drivers face, yelling for him to move his car and never park there again. You get a sense of satisfaction from this kind of relationship, as well as the developing friendship these two develop for one another as they learn to depend on each other.I won't ruin the ending for you, but rest assured that it won't disappoint. This is truly a hidden gem for any American, and I cannot recommend this title more highly.----- 10/10 STARS -------- Review by Searsino -----"
patryk-czekaj,"Jun 15, 2012",8/10,"Intouchables is probably one of the best French movies of the last few decades. It's not hard to see why it raised such a tremendous furor in Europe, and now it's creating an even bigger fan base for itself in the United States. It's so utterly pleasurable and heart-warming. Don't look at it as a foreign feature, though, or you will miss ale the excitement. It's a movie simply made for the viewers to love and remember. Films like this one don't come out too often these days, so just sit back and enjoy it while it's still out on the big screen.Intouchables presents a truly touching story about an unlikely friendship between an older, extremely rich, but severely paralyzed white man and a black man, who just got out of prison. Philippe is in need of a caretaker and as soon as Omar steps into his house he realizes that he might be the right person for this specific role. The plot doesn't concentrate too much on the way that those two guys connect over time, but quickly shows how they got so fond of each other. It was as if they were meant to work together and, in the process, become 'intouchable', in a very profound meaning of the word, and inseparable by any outer force. It's fantastic to see how people from completely different backgrounds are able to form such a strong bond and spend so many wonderful days and nights together. Even though at first it might seem that Omar may be overly vulgar, disrespectful, ignorant, and simply inadequate for this hard job, Philippe is still eager to give him a chance. What's more, many of Philippe closest friends don't approve of his new companion, but that doesn't discourage him.It is simply remarkable, how Omar is able to bring warmth, enthusiasm, and so much fun into Philippe's life. They actually operate on the same wavelength, as it might seem, sharing the same views and opinions on various topics. Through Omar Philippe understands that sometimes all it takes to achieve pure happiness is to let go and do what one feels like doing, as if nothing really mattered, even if you are attached to a wheelchair.And with that moving tale the movie creates a very powerful message, showing that all the wealth and money isn't capable of making a man truly happy, when he doesn't have someone to share it with. It's the richness in heart and mind that really matters, not the abilities of a body blessed with fortune and power.Through his brilliant, funny, and very real performance, Omar Sy will probably give his career a fantastic jump start. He is able to show the transition that his character goes through, from a cold man living on the streets, to a deeply compassionate and art-loving protector, in the most convincing manner.The amount of clever, laughable, and sometimes insulting (but timed very adequately) jokes is simply overwhelming. Also, notice the amazing mix of classic music and 60's soul and the way it enhances the visualization of this very peculiar friendship between the characters.I don't think that if someone would've come to me with a script and said: 'Listen, I got a story about a young black guy who makes fun of a handicapped man and gives him weed to smoke just to make him feel more relaxed' I would've bought it.It's a simple exaggeration, but through that straight statement I want to show that the movie has yet so much more to offer, making the marvelous Intouchables a true stand-out movie of the last few years. Highly recommended."

fortionat1,"Jan 10, 2013",6/10,"I NEVER post a professional review BUT now - - ROGER EBERT reviewed this and said exactly what I felt and wanted to say about this film. Rather than trying to paraphrase his review I am simply posting his original review found on his web page: (since links are not allowed i have put spaces in the link. you need to remove the space to follow the link)http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/ apps/pbcs.dll/ article?AID=/20120530 /REVIEWS /120539995/ 1023It might help to think of ""The Intouchables"" as a French spin off of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" retitled ""Pushing Monsieur Philippe."" A stuffy rich employer finds his life enriched by a wise black man from the Paris ghettos and takes lessons in funky music and the joys of marijuana. This is a story that has been told time and again in the movies, and sometimes the performances overcome the condescension of the formula.The film was an enormous box-office hit in France, and indeed, it is easy to enjoy. Philippe (Francois Cluzet) is a millionaire who was paralyzed from the neck down in a para-gliding accident. Driss (Omar Sy) is a man out on parole for robbery, who applies for the job of Philippe's caregiver only so he can be rejected and get a signature on his application for unemployment benefits. As Philippe interviews one boring job applicant after another, we begin to understand that he needs not only physical help but someone to cheer him up. Driss' cheeky irreverence is refreshing, and Philippe astonishes him and his own household staff by offering him the job.The movie tells the story of a growing relationship between these two likable men, based on Driss' confidence that Philippe will improve if he escapes his stuck-up lifestyle and samples the greater freedoms of an immigrant from Africa. There may be a certain truth in this, but the education of Philippe proceeds in a series of essentially insulting clichés. Driss, you see, has rhythm and soul, and if only Philippe can absorb some of that, he'll be a happier man. He'll still be a French millionaire surrounded by a protective staff, he'll still be paralyzed, but he'll be happier. How many times have we seen the scene where an uptight square inhales pot for the first time and a smile slowly spreads across his face? ""The Intouchables"" has an element of truth that it never quite recognizes. The role of a good caregiver is hardly limited to lifting, bathing, grooming, dressing, pushing and supplying medicines. The patient is faced with a reality he finds it difficult to accept: he has been deprived of all he once took for granted, such as the simple ability to walk across a room. A caregiver can't provide that, but he can provide something more valuable, companionship. Philippe's wife is dead, his teenage daughter is a snotty brat, and his staff is preoccupied by their salaries and status. Driss comes from a different world.The success of the film, despite its problems, grows directly from its casting. Francois Cluzet, who acts only with his face and voice, communicates great feeling. Omar Sy is enormously friendly and upbeat. He reminded me of the African immigrant played by Souleymane Sy Savane in Ramin Bahrani's ""Goodbye Solo"" — a film that avoided the traps that ""The Intouchables"" falls into.The appeal of a film like this, and it is perfectly legitimate, is that when we begin to feel affection for the characters, what makes them happy make us happy. Caught up in the flow of events, we allow many assumptions to pass unchallenged. The writer-directors, Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, are cheerfully willing to go for broad gags, and their style is ingratiating. But at the end, by looking through the foreground details, what we're being given is a simplistic reduction of racial stereotypes.That was also true of ""Driving Miss Daisy,"" but it was a period picture set in the South in the late 1940s, with older characters who had been shaped by their times. There was a plausibility there. ""The Intouchables"" is more of a soothing fantasy.by Roger Ebert - May 30, 2012"
PipAndSqueak,"Sep 23, 2012",7/10,"This a straight-forward and simply told tale of two men discovering a mutual co-dependence based on physical need. Not what you might suppose! This is a tale of a poor immigrant man trying to keep heart and soul together whilst suffering various forms of social exclusion and another man trying to experience life whilst trapped in a paraplegic's body. They are poles apart ethnically, socially, culturally and pretty much every other way too. Nevertheless, the pair bond together through their common pragmatism. The wealthy invalid wants no pity and gets none from his unlikely carer. The outcast finds he has a social as well as an economic value. A heart warming tale and beautifully performed by all the actors - striking a very authentic note, even though we can see some 'facts' have been changed in the telling of this tale."
verrucktcarlos,"Oct 21, 2016",5/10,"I've heard about this movie and how good it is for so long. So I finally decided to watch it, And I did not enjoy it, I did not laugh once, the film was filled with super clichéd jokes.This is purely subjective of course, but Driss was unbearable and super dislikable, he was just a complete idiot, I mean, the way he referred to women???? The part were the man is talking on the phone with the woman he says ''don't forget to ask her about her weight'', was that supposed to be funny? Literally nothing in this movie was funny, there were just the same old repeated unfunny conventional jokes. And I know that a rating below 5 is something bad, a 6-7 is good, and something over 8 is excellent(most of the time), so one may think this is next level, but it wasn't, just from seeing the poster I knew how this was going to be, and I hoped I was wrong, but I wasn't. Not a bad film whatsoever OK, but nothing special."
placebotonic,"Apr 10, 2012",9/10,"Before watching, my only expectation was, that it really is a comedy, not a drama with two laughs in it. Turns out, it was a comedy with very subtle touch of drama, it is a movie worth every second of your time... does it have flaws? I don't know, I was too busy enjoying every minute of it. Captivating actors, beautiful script and great sense of humor. This is one of those very rare movies that make a tiny change deep inside you and you'll know it happened when the movie is over. Watching this, you can laugh at a tetraplegic's shortcomings without feeling bad, because it is in absolutely good spirit, you can laugh at the serious things in life, because they can't kill you and somehow can always find a way to have some fun no matter what."
nikolova-assya,"Apr 21, 2012",N/A,"At first I thought - they say it's a comedy, but I don't see this story about handicapped person finish in other way but in tears. And I was right...only they were tears of pure joy! Both actors Omar and Francois deserve great acclaim for their roles. The chemistry between them is so flawless that by the end they convince you that you are rather looking a documentary then a movie inspired by a true story. Special honors to Omar as his role is what makes the movie. Though he may appear having the happily ever after end of a Cinderella story he fails to fall in the cliché and makes the audience twist and turn till the very end, most of the times laughing out loud. I very much liked the humor - fresh, well pitched, never overboards. So if you are seeking to lighten your spirit yet entertain yourself - try the nice touch of Les Intouchables!"
diaradaisy,"Apr 27, 2017",7/10,"Foreign Films are often disregarded when choosing a film to watch. Foreign Films can also be associated with 'black and white films' which tends to have a negative stigma with young people.On a lazy Sunday afternoon when I would be scrolling through the net looking for a flick I myself would ignore the foreign sector as I would want something light and that wouldn't require too much effort.I then came across 'The Untouchables' I started to watch and the first few minutes in I knew it was going to be a lifelong favourite of mine so I went downstairs and got a drink and snack and snuggled up in bed ready to enjoy now one of my favourite films.If anybody is wanting to get into foreign films this is one that will defiantly let you ease into the genre, I guarantee you'll enjoy it. The genre of the film is so wide that I can recommend it to anyone."
Sergeant_Tibbs,"Jul 10, 2013",7/10,"The Intouchables is one of the popular foreign movies of the last couple of years, rocketing to a comfortable position in IMDb's top 100 and succeeding the European box office. It is a really charming film, but charm doesn't make a film. It's one of those films built on unconventional friendship and culture clash (also a true story and people it's based on appear in the end credits, similar to 127 Hours), but the difference is that the quadriplegic, Philippe, and the caretaker, Driss, have minimal conflict and bond right away as soon as they adjust to each other. Rather than disapprove or be irritated by Driss interfering or being a nuisance during things Philippe likes, he immediately finds it amusing and refreshing. It's nice to see, but it hinders growth of character, which instead they reach effortlessly by sharing the experience of music, hookers, drugs and paragliding. It is quite entertaining and sometimes moving, but there's not really a story or strong narrative here besides two people improving each others lives through a few light situations.Unfortunately the film doesn't have a particular style or it tries things which feel jarring - such as the montage split screen music video style opening credits after a very strong thriller theme. The cinematography is nothing special and the editing is quite distracting with some scenes with time jump cuts that really didn't do it for me. It does focus on its strongest aspects which are the eccentric and charismatic performances, writing and soundtrack (a mix of R'n'B and classical to fit the characters). All the situations are things we've seen before and it's never dealt in a way we haven't seen before (such as Philippe having a long distance lover that Driss pushes him towards), it is the chemistry of the central friendship that makes the film. It is very pleasant. But those pleasant ideas only work for the 2nd act, after an awkward 1st and 3rd that doesn't really satisfy or close itself. It trades potential for genuine conflict or dilemma for directionless despair due to crisis of confidence and ultimately renders the film not making much of an impression. Granted, as a buddy film, it's pretty damn good and it certainly has its strong feel-good moments.7/10"
arabnikita,"Feb 11, 2015",10/10,"Growing up in Russia, I was no stranger to movies from other places besides Hollywood. European cinematography is different when it comes to making Drama and comedies as it enriches movies with a soul and not just superficial emotions. This movie has been no exception.The Intouchables is incredible from the first minutes up until the closing scenes. It displays the aspects of drama by showing a connection between the two worlds that the main characters live in and when the two worlds merge together, the story manages to keep you smiling throughout the duration of the film. The beauty of the film is that it does not force the jokes and humor, the moments kind of happen on their on thanks to the brilliant play of the main characters who have good chemistry.Last but not least, when I rate movies I tend to give 9/10 and usually that last 10th star depends on the music and job that the composers have done. In The Inouchables music fits perfectly into the settings and the emotions... 10 out of 10"
bradencn,"Aug 8, 2014",10/10,"Watching movies with subtitles have never scared me, as several international movies have been a great inspiration to my life (Bon Voyage and Downfall to name a couple). Francois Cluzet is a very believable quadriplegic who is suffering spiritually and emotionally because of the death of his wife and the shame that is associated being paralyzed, while Omar Sy is also the believable ""welfare""-needy man that tries to also care for his several siblings.The one main reason I loved this movie was because of it's classy and genuine humor. Everything was real in this film and it was so easy to relate the themes expressed within it in my own life. There isn't a minute or two that passes by without genuine chuckles or laughter (and a good hearty laugh at that). You learn to love people for who they are, to see the good someone can bring to the world, and to live life always looking forward in the future."
abdelgulabkhan,"Oct 12, 2012",10/10,"This movie is about humanity and friendship, based on a true storyThe disabled man has all the money but he is sad and empty and his life is so boring and routine, he is trapped in his body inside his huge mansion.He employs a guy from the streets, used to hard life in gangs and no money. However this guy is down to earth, simple, and fun.It changes his whole world from boring, to living life on the edge, making the most out of things, having loads of fun. He cuts through all the formal rubbish in the disabled mans life to tell him just do it and go for it. This is the case when he writes love letters for 6 months and he finally gets the big push to meet up with the lady and be happy.It is a story of friendship and how people from two opposite ends of life meet up in order for a care job to be done. In real life it proves people from all backgrounds, money, handicapped can all be good to each other and make a big difference to each others lives.This film is so funny you will laugh so much, it maybe in subtitles but his movie is simply superb.Forget Hollywood £400 million pound blockbusters, this film is not about money it is about true friendship and it beats all them other films by miles"
ketgup83,"Jul 15, 2012",9/10,"The Intouchables had cult status written all over it. It is definitely worth watching thanks to the stupendous performances by Omar Sy and François Cluzet, superb direction and astounding background score.Philippe becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident and is in search of a care-taker to look after him. Driss turns up for the interview , not to get the job though but to get a signature for the welfare trust. Impressed with his attitude, Philippe hires him as his care-take. Over a period of time , a rich white mid-age, filthy rich quadriplegic and an unemployed,poor,care-free black guy become good friend and earn mutual respect for each other. As the story progress, we see how two different people from different background becomes close friends and develops a strong bond.Directed by duo Olivier Nakache and Eric Toledano, The Intouchables, based on true story, is a classic comedy blended with high- octane drama and brave performances. The introductory scene is itself is so impressive that you get engrossed in the film right from the beginning. Hats off to the director to develop the each character effectively which blemishes with film scenario. The script is so tight that you would not feel bore for even a single second in the film. Couple of scenes are hilarious in the movie. The scene where Driss dances to his own tune on Philippe birthday party , the scene where Driss warns Bastein to stay away from Philippe's daughter are just like icing on the cake. Even the emotional scenes have shot so well coupled with beautiful background score. Coming to the performances , I was totally floored by Omar Sy's gallant performance. He makes the film alive the moment he steps in the scene. His care-free , straight from the heart , funny-loving character will stay with you even after leaving the theater for sometime. François Cluzet puts in powerhouse performance as Philippe. It takes guts to sit on chair through the entire film and still act well with just the expressions. Brilliant !!!I kept on hearing about this film for long time and am glad I took the decision to watch the film. There are so many reasons to watch this film - Nice Storyline , strong direction , fantastic performances and above all superb background score that gels with mood of the film !!! Highly recommended : 4/5"
sarlja,"Aug 29, 2023",10/10,The score is brilliant The pace is electric. The Masarati flies. Omar Sy is magnificent as caretaker of millionaire Francois Cluzet who is quadriplegic from an accident in a glider. The scenes gliding are wondrous. My favorite scene is Sy dancing to Earrh Wind And Fire.Most of all this film escapes it's plot. The characters's chemistry does it. The subplots do it. The other characters are all charming. There is humor throughout. The writing is quick and clever. The biggest surprise is the film is never dull but a multi faceted tale of a great friendship between two extremely different men whose main connection occurs because each treats the other as an equal. Great writing and great acting abound.
vicky-769-545306,"Aug 23, 2013",7/10,"When I decided to rent Intouchables on DVD, the store manager told me that it was the best movie he has seen for 3 years. Unfortunately I didn't agree with him. Of course I had a nice time watching it and the fact that the movie is based on a true story is very touching. Both actors were great and especially Omar Sy who was just delightful to watch. But in my opinion it was just a nice, sweet movie nothing more. I think that is very easy to make audience 'emotionally attached' to a film that has to do with a quadriplegic and his life and this is why I believe that it was a safe path for the production and there were not something new, something different, something that can make you wonder and admire the creativity of director or writer."
CineCritic2517,"Feb 6, 2012",4/10,A film about a wealthy paraplegic and his less than obvious choice for a physical aide. The aide is some guy from 'the hood' who gets the job because he shows no pity for the condition of the paralyzed man. From the premise up we get treated to a repetition of the same joke with the paraplegic at the center. I can't remember the last time I saw such an array of unfunny clichés posing as a film. Omar Sy does well as the French version of Will Smith and other actors perform on par. The film's impact just relies too much on the obvious humor excavated from situations involving a man who due to an accident can only move his head. Would perhaps have been funny as an episode of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Quite a trial to sit through.
guney-sadik,"May 30, 2013",10/10,"A man who has,a lots of money,attendants,a nice big palace and unfortunately a body which is good for nothing.Yes he has everything but he need a real friend,he need to meet with somebody who will love and take care of him not just for his money.And there is an another man who had lived a poor life,and who has been living a poor life,who knows the difficulties of life,who came from mean surroundings.And you will see this two different man in the same picture,you will see their unbelievable friendship.You will love this excellent movie.You have to watch this emotional,creative film if you didn't done it yet.Honestly it was,maybe the best film I have ever seen. Thank You."
cianb,"Apr 26, 2013",9/10,"I was slightly pessimistic going into this movie as it was French with English subtitles, but as I got into it the french didn't make any difference. This movie was a brilliant heart warming story and I really enjoyed it! It kept me entertained throughout and I was really disappointed when it finished. The acting was really brilliant and there was numerous very funny parts too. There is also a lot to learn morally from this movie, such as not to judge a book by its cover and so on..Overall I thought it was a very clever film and I would really recommend it. I rated this movie 9 out of 10 because it was very entertaining from start to finish!"
nolandalla-447-695930,"Aug 11, 2012",8/10,"A French movie with English subtitles enters the finicky American movie market with two strikes against it.It's French -- strike one.It has subtitles -- strike two.Which is a crying shame, because one of the year's most enjoyable and uplifting films has pretty much come and vanished from theaters, unable to garner much attention during another summer filled with mindless action adventure ""thrillers"" and sleep-inducing ""comedies."" The Intouchables is a marvelous film. Carried by two outstanding lead performances by Francois Cluzet (who bears an uncanny resemblance to Dustin Hoffman) and Omar Cy (who deserves an Oscar nomination for a movie-stealing performance), this film has wit, candor, humor, sadness, and ultimately great inspiration. The film's credibility is boosted by it being based on a true story.Cluzet plays a quadriplegic, which means he is confined to a wheelchair unable to feel any sensation below his neck. If there's any upside, it's that he's also very wealthy, giving him considerable options that would not otherwise be available to a person of lesser means.Cluzet is utterly bored with his life, not the least of which has anything to do with his physical impairment. One senses that even if he were not parked in a wheelchair, he would still need something more. A great deal more, in fact. What Cluzet needs is stimulation, excitement, and most of all – someone he can call a friend.He finds all of this in the unlikeliest of places.Omar Cy plays the part of unemployed street thug to absolute perfection. He's a Senegalese immigrant languishing in the slums of Paris burdened with typical urban family difficulties -- poverty, drug abuse, lack of hope and opportunity. One can imagine that there are many Omar Cy's living as second-class citizens throughout the modern world. In fact, the city here may be Paris. But it could just as easily be Sao Paulo or Chicago. He meets Cluzet in what can only be described as an unexpected encounter, and the two men begin to engage in an uneasy, but captivating friendship.Everyone can see what's coming next. And that's perfectly okay. Initially indifferent to Cluzet's condition, Cy will ultimately come to care deeply for the man who is not just an employer, but a pathway out of pointlessness. The man in the chair becomes a muse and means of escape, an emotional and spiritual home for a foreigner who instantly resumes the role of ""immigrant"" once he steps back beyond the threshold of Cluzet's luxurious apartment and back onto the streets of Paris.The two men desperately need each other, in completely different ways. Eventually, they engage on a bucket list of activities, bonding in the process, allowing the rest of us to go along for the ride. And what a joyous ride it is.Critics have correctly pointed out this film gives a somewhat sanitized depiction of what being without the use of one's arms and legs must be like. While most of the film focuses on the role of caregiver, we are constantly reminded (or perhaps, I simply could not get it out of my mind) that not every quadriplegic receives such meticulous physical care nor emotional support. It helps to have money, no matter who you are.But I was willing to overlook this and enjoy a film full of energy, comedy, and ultimately of happiness.Admittedly, the conclusion of the film seems all too neat and tidy. But again, I am going to give the filmmakers a pass here for reasons you may understand only if you see the film, which enables audiences to come and appreciate how important people are to other people. After all, we are allowed to enjoy an uplifting film every once in a while. Never mind that it's all somewhat contrived.One of my barometers in judging a film comes with a fundamental question. Namely, do I think about the film the next day, and perhaps the next.I did. I must admit I was moved emotionally by this film. So was everyone else in the audience, from the reactions I saw. I laughed. I teared up. And, I rejoiced in the end.Call me naive, but I wish all life ended just like it does in the movies. I know -- it doesn't.But that won't stop me from dreaming and enjoying the fantasy."
robbeaus,"Oct 3, 2012",10/10,"This is not just the shoe in for the best foreign language film at the 2013 Oscars, if there was any justice in the world the Best Film, Best Actor and Best Supporting Actor, it is that good. I have no intention of spoiling anybody's enjoyment of this film by spoiling it. But this film does jokes the way you and I eat the popcorn in the cinema. From the soon to be classic dance sequence, to the down right hilarious in a wicked bad taste way tash monologue. What should be a dour tragic tet a tet between a down at heals Algerian immigrant and a upper class French billionaire, is nothing of the sort, it's uplifting its got a heart and above all it propels French Film into the super star bracket.

ggk-34-546807,"May 26, 2012",10/10,"I saw this movie today and It's really, really hard to say to what wasn't said before. This is just a perfect movie. A simple story about a poor black guy taking care of old paralyze man. It's simple, sweet and at moments very, very funny. The actor who plays Driss makes excellent job by portraying character as street-wise and amusing. It's just a short of person who you would want to hang-out with from the very first second.Some of my favorite parts are the comedy which often take you off-gourd but drama is perfect as well. There where few small moments when movie felt manipulative (playing sad music in a scene that otherwise would be happy moments)but my only honest complain is the fact that the movie Driss doesn't look a thing as the historical one, and the fact that they show the footage of actual Driss during the credits doesn't help much."
peter-462-12592,"Feb 21, 2013",10/10,Im not a fan of french movies at all but i must say this movie surprised me. The acting is superb and realistic as if they really were these characters for real.Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy had a great connection they fit very well together in this movie. I think anybody would like it as its just not an ordinary french movie. It is also a very funny one that will definitely make you laugh and feel happy. I really recommend this movie.So if you are looking for a movie that will inspire you then this is what you are looking for.

Its extremely unrealistic, and i guess i dont like these types of movies, Especially not when its suppost to be one of those ""deep deep"" movies about life, friendship, poverty etc. Not sure if its because im not french, but i didnt like the humor in the movie either. Its not a very exciting movie either. I would have liked some more depth, a deeper story, and to see more of Driss challenges. We never Saw which problems he had with his new job, comming with no experience etc. It was just so painfully unrealistic which is annoying, when its suppost to be a deep meaningful movie. So not my cup of tea, and frankly i Think its Way too overrated. I dont get the High ratings."
august-malsawm,"Mar 14, 2013",8/10,"Before watching this movie, I was a little apprehensive as the movie was in French (although I find the language romantic). I was also pulled by the two smiling faces on the movie poster usually these things means a lot to movie addicts like myself. As one go deeper into the movie, it gives an understanding of how life truly is and how people sometimes are not what they really seem. 'The Intouchable' is truly a fun, entertaining and meaningful movie.The actors are great and unlike other movies I have watched recently, there is no over acting on their part. Every character adds to the colorfulness of the movie and the movie obviously was sure how the plot would go from beginning to end like most great novels. Since it is based on a true story, it makes you wonder how two people from two totally different world find a friend in such condition. I do not know how much this movie achieved, award wise but I am positive, it is a movie for all people who watch movies for all reasons.This movie may not make the adrenaline going like Skyfall but no doubt about it, it is just as good. This movie is worth every penny & time."
BeneCumb,"Sep 18, 2012",8/10,"Although the plot is based on real events, it must be very difficult to balance sorrow and joy, wealth and poverty, constrained disability and (hyper)activity in such a way that the result is not rude and/or embarrassing. In spite of several teases and jokes related to disability, they are included in a logical and realistic way into Driss 's character (splendidly played by Omar Sy). No wonder that the film has received so much warm welcome and has become one of the biggest French successes all over the world. Opposites, even antipodes have several things in common, but there are a few occasions triggering the events to understand them.The film could be recommended even to those who have disabled persons closely around. Perhaps it is then possible to find new angles to deal with them and bring more joy and variety into their lives.And last but not least: I hope no Hollywood remake is made, although Eddie Murphy and Dustin Hoffman (just my guess due to their looks and similarity) could be tempted to go for it..."
sweetboyy_99,"Mar 22, 2013",8/10,"So, i saw this movie in french class. And i don't regret i did. It's got to be one of the best french movies i've ever watched. It's a really great feel-good movie. It's full of laughs, tears and emotions beyond anything. And i'm really impressed, as this is Omar's first lead role in acting, he played it off really well, not just in the funny parts, but as well in the emotionally acted parts. This is defentily a movie i would watch over and over again and recommend to all my friends. Definitely one of the best french movies i've seen in a while. I'm so glad i saw it. You should too. Everythings good. The storyline, the screenplay and the directing. The acting is great as well, and the humor would probably go well in all countries, not just France. It's worth a watch and deserves an 8!"
Lucy_Rose84,"Feb 9, 2013",9/10,"So many movies and TV programmes involving disabled characters are saccharine and patronising in an effort to inspire or hammer home a message of triumph over adversity. Not so the Intouchables. This movie finally gives an honest portrait of disabled man, at once gruesome and humbling, while keeping the focus firmly on his relationship with his carer instead of dwelling on his disability. Indeed this is a story as much about overcoming class divide as it is about overcoming physical disability.Down and out Driss, part of Paris's disenfranchised and unemployed black youth, applies for a position as millionaire quadriplegic Phillipe's carer in order to get a signature for his jobseeker's benefit. Phillipe, appreciating the young man's honesty and frank attitude towards his condition, hires Driss and simultaneously resolves the Driss's poverty and his own boredom.The genius of this film, in spite of its dark subject matter and themes of disability, class and race, is that it is genuinely hilarious. Omar Sy as the no holds barred Driss oozes cool and yet is heartbreakingly affectionate towards Francois Cluzet's Phillipe.I laughed and cried in equal measure - what more can you ask?"
jgcorrea,"Jun 23, 2024",N/A,"After he becomes a quadriplegic from a paragliding accident, an aristocrat hires a young man from the projects to be his caregiver. Sy and Cluzet give their parts more conviction than they deserve, but their energies can't revive a corpse this dead, this corny, this calculating , this condescending and this commercial, a kinda wishful drama about the friendship between a rich, white quadriplegic and a penurious black job-seeker. Scripters Toledano and Nakache delivered an offensve film. The moments when they are together fill us with inauthentic feeling-good sentiments. Not a must-see picture."

quinnvine,"Feb 8, 2019",9/10,"A touching story about 2 very unlikely friends turns out to be one of the best films I have ever seen. Before this I had never seen a French film and was worried about being lost in translation and unfamiliarity with the cast, but the language does not at all take away from the experience and the acting is phenomenal. Although no art form is perfect, this film is a masterpiece and deserves every 10 stars I have given here. It hits the mark in every area. The music is excellent and very well fitting, the humor is absolutely hilarious and relatable, the cinematography is on point, and the story itself has good structure and is very well fitting. This is an experience you won't forget."
ExtremeCloseUp,"Mar 1, 2024",N/A,"Intouchables' message is simple but powerful and touching nonetheless. People need companionship. And when they find themselves in a dark place, that's even more important. Even though the plot develops like a typical Hollywood-y romantic comedy (two people meet, they have a good time, then they break up and finally they are together again), in this case it's about a different kind of relationship, the friendship between two men, a quadriplegic, Philippe (Francois Cluzet) and his caretaker, Driss (Omar Sy). Driss' role goes way beyond helping Philippe overcome his physical limitations, he shows him how to have fun and enjoy himself. The movie's biggest asset is the performances and the great chemistry between the two leads. The comedic aspect is stronger than the dramatic, as the latter can get too simplistic, plus it can lose touch with reality due to its excessive optimism, not to mention it doesn't avoid various cliches."
maltafahmad,"Mar 7, 2025",10/10,I have finished watching it right now and i am unable to describe in words how great this movie is i have never watched a French movie before actually i am from Pakistan and i grew up watching just Hollywood Movies or British but recently I've came across intoucables on IMDB and i decided to watch it and just now as I finished watching it. To be honest i have never enjoyed so much watching a movie ever before like this one part of me so pleased with movie and other part of me just feels upset because genuinely i feel like it's too short i wish it could be more lengthy like 4 or may be 6 hours so on I've could never be bored of it watching it's just Exceptional incredible beautiful Movie. Im just finishing it here but i can write about it as long as it goes!!

Bofsensai,"Dec 31, 2016",5/10,"* i.e. as in black hero's name in the movie.I came to this unusually for me, through the trailer, coz it seemed to be such potentially feel- good 'based on a true story' inspiration: and perhaps it was: but for me the ultimate betrayal was to see in the final credit sequence the two it was truly based on, the one who the real hero was  (da, da, da credits plot spoiler alert) NOT BLACK!! He was white and of mid Europe descent: Apparently, the directors just preferred the black actor; nothing to argue with there (if he's good - and he is) but, beware, that particularly relevant factor then, is NOT BASED ON THE TRUTH. The original inspiration has been marginalised/ 'white'washed outta da movie public's knowledge/appreciation/enjoyment.Then - as several have here also well noted - the (French?!) attitude portrayed towards women is positively neanderthal! Did they mean that? Or is that automatic to French storytelling? Even to excuse one women's (sensible) brush off of the black helper's unsophisticated bathroom overtures, in the end they make it all alright she declined him, by inferring the only reason she would turn him down is coz .. (da, da, daa) she's lesbian! NOT because she thought he was immature arrogant chauvinistAs in spreading the fact that it was 'based on truth', then certainly as uplifting as the Omar Sy character is shown doing for his paraplegic saviour (he's saved from a downtrodden marginalised poor life by his 'service'): otherwise, 'based on' bordering a travesty of the truth."

belkabuh74,"Jul 4, 2023",10/10,"""The Intouchables,"" also known as ""1+1,"" is an emotionally captivating film that effortlessly blends comedy, drama, and the strength of human connection. Directed by Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano, this French masterpiece takes audiences on a profound journey that touches the heart, challenges societal norms, and celebrates the beauty of diversity.Based on a true story, the film introduces us to Philippe (François Cluzet), a wealthy quadriplegic who hires Driss (Omar Sy), a charismatic ex-convict, as his caretaker. Initially, their relationship appears to be an unconventional pairing, given their starkly different backgrounds and circumstances. However, as the story unfolds, we witness the transformative power of their friendship.One of the film's greatest strengths lies in its ability to tackle serious themes with a delicate balance of humor and sensitivity. The script masterfully navigates the challenges faced by Philippe, his physical limitations, and his emotional struggles, while shedding light on the less privileged world that Driss comes from. The juxtaposition of their lives creates a thought-provoking narrative that challenges preconceived notions of class, race, and disability.The performances in ""The Intouchables"" are nothing short of exceptional. François Cluzet delivers a nuanced portrayal of Philippe, capturing the vulnerability and resilience of a man confined to a wheelchair. Omar Sy's performance as Driss is both hilarious and heartfelt, as he brings an infectious energy and unfiltered honesty to the role. The chemistry between Cluzet and Sy is palpable, and their on-screen dynamic forms the beating heart of the film.Beyond its powerful performances, ""The Intouchables"" is visually stunning, with elegant cinematography that captures the beauty of Paris and the contrasting worlds inhabited by the two protagonists. The film's soundtrack, featuring a combination of classical pieces and contemporary tracks, adds another layer of depth to the storytelling, enhancing the emotional impact of each scene.At its core, ""The Intouchables"" is a celebration of the indomitable spirit of the human soul. It teaches us that friendship knows no boundaries and that compassion and understanding can bridge even the widest gaps. The film invites us to reflect on our own biases and perceptions, urging us to embrace empathy and embrace the transformative power of human connection.In conclusion, ""The Intouchables"" is an absolute gem of a film that will make you laugh, cry, and ultimately leave you feeling uplifted. With its poignant storytelling, remarkable performances, and a powerful message, it transcends cultural boundaries and resonates with audiences worldwide. This heartfelt cinematic masterpiece serves as a reminder that life's most profound moments are often found in the most unexpected places and through the most unlikely friendships."
petarmatic,"Mar 16, 2014",5/10,"I will not share enthusiasm for this film. I saw other reviews. I know it is politically correct to help people. And I did not think of the disabled people. I was thinking about millions of Africans and other immigrants trying to come into France, specially Paris and trying to find a job. How many will succeed, one per cent? This film focuses on a aristocrat who hires a poor African from the suburbs of Paris. How often that happens in the real life? Not that often.Plot is, well OK, but not that realistic, and that is what I hate. I like realistic plots not improbable ones like this one.Acting is excellent, actors are really trying to make something out of this film. Many people liked it. I did not that much."
ianharrison747,"Jan 12, 2021",8/10,"Omar Sy is superb. The cast is perfectly balanced. Unpredictable yet warm and humorous. Really fascinating providing a link between the rich and powerful with the poor yet powerful. So many different levels. The main man Driss doesn't understand political correctness yet exudes care and an almost insane sense of responsibility. More than the loveable rogue yet looking for that impossible square hole. Great music, photography and a fab car that matches Driss's personality. Is the egg Kinder or Faberge ...?"
Korimei,"Jan 8, 2021",10/10,"This film manage to craft a story about friendship which I feel very few movies were able to portray. The film does a good job creating character development and the natural transition to friendship that doesn't feel force at all. I really like Driss interaction with Yvonne, which I feel no one is talking about."
Low7ren_Ngabia,"Nov 18, 2025",9/10,"The true story of Driss and Philippe is captured beautifully by directors Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano. The special bond between the two protagonists is just amazing. The directors went deep to help us truly understand their connection, portraying their personalities in a way that feels personal and authentic.Both Omar Sy and François Cluzet are incredibly talented actors. I love how naturally they fit into their roles, which made the film not only entertaining but also emotionally moving for me.The duet of the two actors created one of the most beautiful films I've ever seen. Their acting made me truly enjoy the story of Philippe and Driss.The movie features enjoyable & funny scenes and in spite of it being a French film, no no no because it's a French film, it had such a unique charm to it :)I truly enjoyed the journey of Philippe and Driss. This is just a solid 9.7 for me."

ssssgelojun,"Aug 27, 2020",9/10,"At first, I just couldn't understand why Desis, who was so rude and even nasty, had been chosen by Philip. But Philip was lonely and fragile at heart, with a strong sense of pride, and the professional nurses could not give him spiritual equality, nor could they give him the peace of mind to face his happy pen Pal as a disabled man. DE Assis was an accident of Philip's orderly life, but a late consolation in the spirit. There was no class, no color, no race but mutual understanding.Mutual redemption requires no sympathy. Can not describe that kind of feeling, probably is the warmth of the long run. In terms of love, friendship, the best relationship is mutual achievement."
Motion-Picture-Watchmen,"Dec 25, 2022",7/10,"The titular characters are what make the movie. The visible chemistry of their friendship despite their sociocultural and intellectual differences is simply lovely.The ""légérété"" with which the film progresses is so quintessential French.Furthermore, the multiple thoughtful messages of this movie-tolerance towards the incapacitated, not trying to be reduced to a social background- are also notable as they are laudable.I just think it's marvelous that we live in a time where we can provide extensively to people with serious disabilities. Humanity still is befallen with imperfections, but it's trying.The recurring piano theme is beautiful. Especially it's use at the end is striking.All in all, this is another testimony of French cinemas timeless place in the world."
alarech-,"Jun 6, 2024",10/10,"I don't know where I should start. This film is always number one for me. No matter how much time I watch, it always impresses me. I must give thanks to the cast for their perfect acting. The harmony of these leading roles is excellent. They complement each other perfectly. You can feel their bond while watching. As for the scenario, they've designed it perfectly. It is really gripping. The plot of the film is based on a real-life story. You should read the real book, which I strongly recommend. In this way, you can better relate to the film. You are always going to be my favorite, Intouchables."

patr1ck_bat3man,"Jan 16, 2021",9/10,The Intouchables is film about a quadriplegic millionaire who hires a man who is not suited for the job to take care of him. The film is a masterpiece its funny and really makes you appreciate life more and more. I though if I ever was a quadriplegic I will want Omar Sy to be my assistant definitely. I always think that the worst feeling to have for someone is pity what ever the situation is. The scene most magical scene is at the party of Philippe's birthday - that music by the orchestra was not to dance-to everyone thought that if the music is danceble is going to make Philippe uncomfortable but when Driss decides to dance everyone just started to dance with him and Philippe really was happy despite that he couldn't. The film was based on a true story and ITS A MUST SEE for everyone.
lilagajanyan,"Mar 9, 2023",10/10,"The first time I watched Intouchables was back in high school. We had to watch the film in English in order to improve our listening skills. Since then, I have watched this movie a few times and it has become one of my favorite films ever. Intouchables is a heartfelt story about friendship. The film is about the relationship and prejudice between two races. The film is loosely based on the true story of Abdel Sallou's friendship with a paralyzed millionaire, Phillipe Pozzo di Borgo. In the film, Phillipe hires a young man from the projects named Driss to take care of him and they both develop an unlikely friendship.The story is very interesting and shows that two people from different races can confront their obstacles in life. The main leads, Francois Cluzet and Omar Sy, are fantastic and share great chemistry together. It also has great moments of humor that brought a smile to my face.I love how the relationship between Driss and Phillipe develops from two people arguing against each other to becoming true friends. Some movies can work with a good story but they need good performances; in Untouchables, it's almost impossible to determine who carried the film, both Cluzet and Sy were great. The soundtrack of the film is also brilliant and adds to the emotional scenes in the film.Great movie, it's a must-watch 🙂"
olivier-zueri,"Apr 15, 2014",7/10,"For some reason I wasn't so into all the hype about this movie. I feel like I've seen this story before. Think Rain Man, I am Sam and so forth. My wife wanted to watch it and I bought it for her as a gift and to be honest, I was pleasantly surprised.First of all...I do not understand French...but I won't watch dubbed films. So we watched it in French with English subtitles. The humour does come across, although I'm sure I missed a bit of it. Referring specifically to some possibly French or Parisian in-jokes.The flow of the movie was good, the translated script funny - even witty at times. The acting was better than what you generally expect from your standard Hollywood movie.What I did like about Driss's character is that he doesn't dance around the fact that his new boss is a paraplegic...at all. The bond that evolves between the Philippe & Driss is brought across genuinely...for the most part. I think a 90 minute movie will have a tough time to bring across the core of the relationship between these two characters, but they actors and the directors do a good job.Overall it's a movie to watch and feel good about yourself, whilst at the same time you are reminded to appreciate the things you have; served with a healthy dose of humour, a dash or two of romance and a smidgen of those earnest, emotional realities of life. A feel-good movie, one can actually feel good about having watched.Cheers, OlivierZ"
claudiusdominique,"May 19, 2021",9/10,"The Intouchables / The Upside (remake of ""Intouchables"")The Upside is a movie directed by Neil Burger. The writer is Jon Hartmereis but his screenplay is based on The Intouchables, inspired by a true story. The two original writers of ""Intouchables"" are French writer/director duo Olivier Nakache & Éric Toledano. The American version is staring Kevin Hart (a well-known stand-up comedian turned actor) as Dell Scott (the caregiver of Phillip Lacasse), Bryan Cranston (from Breaking Bad fame) as Phillip Lacasse (a paralysed person on a wheelchair), Nicole Kidman as Yvonne Pendleton, (Phillip's devoted personal assistance), Golshifteh Farahani as Maggie (Phillip's attractive physical trainer).Dell and Phillipe have a good relationship between music, women, etcetera. In their relationship a lot of ups and downs happen. Phillipe has a surprise party organized by Yvonne, but Phillipe wanted to have nothing for his birthday. Phillipe ask dell to break things for him because he was mad and uncapable from his quadriplegic condition. I found this scene emotional and heartbreaking. This scene was one of the best improvements to the original French version.Olivier Nakache and Éric Toledano are a duo writer. Their 3 other popular film are C'est la vie! (2017), The Specials (2019) and Tellement proches (2009) which they all made together! Intouchables is the most well like by the public. The English version is funnier at times, while the French version is more emotional between the two main characters.The Upside is a comedy. A lot of moment in The Upside has humor. The Intouchables and The Upside has still a lot of differences. In The Intouchables Driss (Dell in The Upside) likes Magalie (Yvone in The Upside) and flirts with here a lot. In The Upside Dell (Driss in The Intouchables) is making a lot of joke but Phillipe is more serious. But in The Intouchables the both are laughing and telling jokes more equally which makes for the stronger bond. It is a touching story, and fun that is based on a real life unlikely friendship like the Green Book.I will rate both 9/10. I recommend them.The Upside

Maybe it's the fantasy it spins on racial/social/cultural mores, much as Driving Miss Daisy did 20-odd years ago – uptight rich white employer learns to love through black employee's life-force. That was set in the segregationist America of the 1940s. What's this film's excuse?""While ""the Independent"" is right to call out the film's unrealistic portrayals of race and class, perhaps it somewhat misses the point. This film is obviously humorous, clearly not based on reality, and is probably not meant to be taken seriously. The movie has very much the same spirit as ""The Birdcage"" (at least the American version, if not the French one).Now, this means the film also happens to be overrated, currently (November 2014) sitting high on IMDb's Top 250. A good comedy, yes, but not a film that offers any sort of deeper meaning or one that will remain important over the long term. While popular and a box office record holder, this is not a title one expects to be considered a ""classic"" later on."
grahamf-55542,"Mar 25, 2022",8/10,This was the perfect antidote to watching a rather dark humourless series. No great depth in the plot but it was amusing and well-acted by the two main characters.I'd certainly recommend this.

He gets a care taker who not only proves to be black but also seems to have no respect to the man. And since he does not struggle to please him he treats him a as a normal guy!That is a story of a friendship and bond created between two unique men. They fit. They complete each other. Their energy is filled with will of life.Lots of wonderful sense of humor. Watch for the moments when Omar Sy plays barber and makes fun from his ""helpless victim"" who gets most of the fun of it actually ....Watching this movie is like a powerful pill of life motivation.

lutkinart,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"Each of us sooner or later begins to complain about life. The film talks about the main character, in the past he was a businessman and was seriously injured, as a result of which he became disabled. The second main character also featured - a black man from a poor family who was looking for a way to earn money.In short, the plot of the entire movie is that our second protagonist takes a job as a nurse for the first.Enjoying life and living every moment has become significantly problematic for our businessman. Having a lot of money, a wonderful mind and a huge number of hobbies, he was left without the opportunity to enjoy it to the fullest.The film really makes you think about your own life, or rather about its value.Dramatic and comedic in places, he harmoniously presents the main idea - you can't give up and you need to be able to find the positive in any situation!"
JayWolfgramm,"Dec 22, 2023",6/10,"""Intouchables"" is a very unique movie. If I were to describe all the events that happen in the movie, you would think it was a TV mini-series full of episodic misadventures. But, with the way the movie edits its scenes, it moves along at a clip, never wasting a minute. Hearing that, you may think that the film is action packed. But no, it is a very mellow movie. The film is at its strongest when our two main characters are just hanging out. Whenever Philipe and Driss are sharing screentime together, it is a good time. It is whenever the movie jumps to a conflict it is less interesting.I'm glad to see that so many people enjoyed this relatively small French film from 2011. I genuinely wish I would have liked it more, I just found the conflicts with the kid, the egg and the family to be draining. But the time our two leads are just hanging out, it is a real good time."
dierregi,"Mar 1, 2025",1/10,"Untouchable is the cinematic equivalent of lukewarm tea: inoffensive, predictable, and inexplicably beloved by millions. A true mystery.The film follows the tired trope of the ""unlikely friendship"", this time between a wealthy quadriplegic and a streetwise drifter, hitting every cliché along the way. Groundbreaking it ain't. Allegedly based on a real story, though the filmmakers decided that real life wasn't clichéd enough and sprinkled in every stereotype they could find.Omar Sy's Driss is an exaggerated caricature, from his jobless status to his obligatory petty theft when casually pockets a Fabergé egg while being interviewed. Naturally, only to give it to his overworked mother, who is drowning in an excessive number of children. Cliché.The film sticks rigidly to the ""unlikely buddies"" formula. At first, Driss is inappropriate, brash, and completely unfit for the job. But wait! Just when you think Philippe might give up, a miraculous transformation begins. Through a series of manufactured heartwarming moments, the two start to bond. Driss, with his street smarts and carefree attitude, teaches Philippe how to really live. Philippe, in return, introduces Driss to art and classical music - because, naturally, he's never encountered culture before.Safe, shallow, and designed to make audiences feel good without provoking real thought, The ""Intouchables"" is not terrible, just profoundly unoriginal.But apparently, if you slap on an uplifting soundtrack and sprinkle in some ""deep"" life lessons, people will eat it up. Given its absurdly high praise, a rating of 1 feels entirely justified."

I was in the mood for something I had already seen before and something easily digestible and this was the perfect choice. Not only was it still funny and deeply satisfying, I was, once again, amazed by the sheer simplicity and subtlety. There is a light tone of drama and emotion, a great sense of humour, and just an all-round wholesome film that stands on itself. Even if Omar Sy is undoubtedly the magic ingredient."
