keving4241,"Oct 11, 2018",10/10,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is.War is hell and this movie not only shows that while being an entertaining experience but also captured what soldiers are left behind with. My grandfather was not afraid of anything. I've seen this man walk into a cellar full of black widows to get firewood and not even shake them off. The only time he ever experienced fear was when he went to bed. His nightmares of his time during the war would haunt him in his sleep. This movie helped me understand why."
j-a-julian,"Dec 31, 2019",10/10,"The first 23 minutes of this film is rated at a 12.My good friend and I took our sons, 17 at the time, to see this in a theater. I am a senior military officer who experienced combat in 1967 - 68 - 69. We wanted the boys to see the horror of war, the slaughter.I have had to pack up the personal effects of my comrade to send back to his mother after he was killed in the Viet Nam war. Those of you who have not done this cannot even comprehend.After the opening combat scenes the film was an 8. Well done.War is hell and to those of us who have been there ... well I don't know what to say.Neither of our sons joined the military ... thank God."
bigmikeh-59467,"Sep 12, 2019",10/10,21 years ago this movie was released and I finally watched it in 2019. I really struggled to watch and I cried and I wept through most of the movie. I did two tours in Nam. This movie was like being back in country. I will never watch it again. It's just eats my guts out.
dedjim,"Jun 10, 2001",N/A,"I know it's fashionable to trash successful movies but at least be honest about the trashing... Pvt. Ryan was fiction but it was pretty good HISTORICAL fiction. The details were well thought out and based on reality.There was nothing stupid about the portrayal of the German army... Rommel DID blunder in his placement of force, The high command DID think Calais was going to be the invasion spot, not Normandy. Hitler didn't wake up until noon on that day and his aides were afraid to wake him. The Rangers did come in right behind the first wave and did take a beach exit by sheer will to get the hell off the beach. The bluffs were the scene of heavy close fighting. The german defenders were mostly Eastern European conscripts from defeated areas. (note that the 2 men that tried to surrender were NOT speaking German). There WAS a young man rescued from interior Normandy after his brothers were all killed. He WAS an airborne trooper (the difference was that he was found by a chaplain and was removed from the front.)The battles inside Normandy were small actions town to town, street to street, house to house. Small actions like taking the radar station happened. Small actions like a handful of men defending a river bridge against odds happened. Small squads of men, formed out of the misdrops banded together ad hoc to fight. There were all enlisted groups and all officer groups. A General did die in the glider assault. FUBAR aptly described much of what happened that day.And there were only Americans in the movie because the Brits and Canadians were many klicks away in a different area... this was Omaha beach. The story was an American one. And Monty DID bog down the advance and everyone knew it. And as for ""American Stereotypes""... well those pretty much define America: my college roomie was a wise-ass New York Jew. My best friend was a second generation east coast Sicilian.  My college girlfriend was a third generation German. My first wife was French and English. I'm Irish, my boss is Norwegian and I work with a Navaho... you get the point?So much for it being bad history. It was in fact an excellent way to let a jaded and somewhat ignorant-of-their-past generation *feel* something of what their grandparents (LIVING grandparents) went through. It is perhaps less important that the details be exact as the feel be right. Even now the details are not fully known or knowable about that campaign... it was too big, too complex and too chaotic to be knowable. There is not even an accurate casualty count of D-Day itself.Now as to the depth of characters. What I saw there was the extraordinary circumstances into which ordinary people were thrown and what happened to them. I saw the things that would mark a generation (I have heard in my elderly male patients sentiments similar to what Cpt. Miller was expressing when he announced his ordinariness) I saw the dehumanization that occurs with war and its mitigation moment to moment, man to man... Cpt. Miller didn't know anything about Ryan and he didn't care... until Ryan revealed his humanity to him with his story of his brothers. Pvt. Reiban was ready to walk out of the situation until he discoverd his captains ordinariness and his humanity. Then he began to look to him almost as a father. Pvt. Mellish rightfully delights in his revenge for all the times he's had to take it because he was Jewish by telling German captives he's ""Juden!"" Nerdish Cpl. Upham can stand alongside his bigger, stronger, braver Ranger compatriots and describe the poetry and melancholy of Edith Piaf's song... then face his cowardice, turn around and stand up in the face of danger and finally demonstrate the dehumanization of the enterprise he was enmeshed in by executing Steamboat Willie... even though Willie had no more choice about being there than Upham did and in other circumstances would have made a friend.I could go on and on with this but enough already. OK, perhaps it is not The Best Movie Ever Made but it is still a good movie. And if one will take the blinders of fashionable negativism off they will see it. Finally, this is not a patriotic story... if anything it is an acknowledgement and thank you to all those old men still out there that did so much for us. To them I say a deep and sincere thank you."
weiz_one,"Nov 17, 1999",10/10,"I have never been affected by a movie the way Saving Private Ryan affected me.  That movie really took me out of my seat in the movie theater and practically had me believing I was really in the battle with John Miller. When somebody was dying in that movie, it felt as if you could almost feel their pain.  Speilberg did an unbelievable job of putting realism into this movie with the camera-work and everything else.  Simply amazing.  An all time great."
lc-2,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"It gives a million reason why no one should go to war and one very powerful reason to go to war. It is a soul numbing realistic depiction of what our grandfathers, fathers, uncles, brothers and sons have faced in humanities darkest moments. Not just in WWII but in any war. No one can see this movies without being altered in some way. No one should miss it with the EXCEPTION of those war veterans that have already been there. The surround sound puts the audience in the middle of the battle.Steven Spielberg has out done himself and effectively held up a mirror to civilization for events to which we should all be ashamed of, rather than appalled at the movie for its real life depictions. I suggest that this movie be made standard view for congress as well as the President each and every time the question of war comes up. This movie would not stop future wars but I would hope the objectives would be much more clearly defined. I say this as a US Marine."
adammfeeley,"May 12, 2015",10/10,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.
janesbit1,"Jan 25, 2000",9/10,"It's been over a year since first seeing Saving Private Ryan -- it's a worthy effort by Speilberg--his best since Shindler's List by far. You've probably heard about the amount of violence, blood, and gore and that's all true--it's got the Viet Nam movie style violence (and then some) but it's not gratuitous. Were it sanitized like early WWII movies, modern audiences probably wouldn't take it as seriously.The movie has that trademark Speilberg style--the structure is all tied up and unified from beginning to end, the emotional symbols abound, the music swelling when he's working at your emotions, the hand held camera that worked so well in Shindler's List to give you a feeling of participation, camera angles and periods of silence to disorient you (like Shindler), suspense techniques learned from Hitch... It's a movie that stays with you for a period afterwards.Hanks will be the early front runner for Oscar after this flick--Academy members like him AND it IS his best acting job ever. While Speilberg will likely be criticized for attempting to manipulate the audience's emotions while keeping a distance from the inner core of his characters, Tom Hanks reveals a really complex military leader in this story, and does so without overacting--somehow it comes from within. While you may not empathize deeply with many of the platoon, you will still feel something because of the relationship that is formed with Hanks.After the initial set-up, you will have the opportunity to participate in the D-Day operation and experience the horror of it. Those who have been in a real war can comment about how realistic or not Speilberg captures its chaotic horror in this scene.In my case I again feel very lucky that my draft number was high, so I never had to face Nam like many of my classmates. Speilberg reminds us brutally in ""Saving Private Ryan"" that we All have a debt to pay to the brave souls who have sacrificed so much for us. What Tom Hanks does with his performance is to remind us of this debt in a very personal way."
wheatley-20230,"May 13, 2021",6/10,"You can't fault the production or the acting. So why does this film fail to live up to its promise?I think it is perhaps the episodic nature of the story. Each episode is fine but they don't add up to something greater. Instead the initial power of the film, built on those opening scenes on Omaha beach, is gradually dissipated.The great war films - Paths of Glory, The Dam Busters, Glory, All Quiet of the Western Front - have a driving force in their plot that does not let you go.But then again - 1917 is certainly a great war film and is also episodic. But the director keeps us hooked in a way that Spielberg does not manage here."
morales123,"May 17, 2000",N/A,"To think that this movie did not win Best Picture is a crime. Director Steven Spielberg uses all of his talent and resources to give to the world the greatest war film ever made.Though it's true that this is not the type of movie you want to sit down with the family and eat popcorn, the emotional drive of the picture, the story's poignant messages, and the fantastic acting of the cast draws you into a world that is both dangerous and unpredictable.Spielberg is able to take you into action and make you feel as if you are a participant in the movie and not just a viewer. This is Tom Hanks' best movie he ever did. Forget his performances in Philadelphia and Forrest Gump (though they were also good); he should have received another Oscar for the role of Capt. John Miller, a leader who must act strong in front of his men, but must also hide his emotions from them.  It would have been well-deserved if he won again.I give this movie my highest recommendation. Saving Private Ryan is a movie that makes you realize how life is precious and how honor and duty, though they are deep philosophical concepts that are praised in war, can put you in jeopardy of losing your life for something you may not believe in."
Nazi_Fighter_David,"Oct 26, 2008",9/10,"Steven Spielberg makes a unique motion picture in regards to the D-Day invasion of World War II just in the gritty reality of the detail For more than twenty minutes he revives for us the landing at Omaha beach No one was prepared for how horrific it really was No one understood what was going on: The terror, the chaos, the maelstrom of bullets, the near-deafening explosionsYou really got a sense of what these guys had to go throughWithin that perplexity, the focus settles on six soldiers under the command of Capt. Miller (Tom Hanks) after they've survived their terrible hours breaking through the first line of German defense, they're given a strange perilous mission, to find one man, Pvt. Ryan (Matt Damon), a paratrooper who's somewhere behind German lines For them, it's an abstruse order, but they have to get it doneThroughout the film, Spielberg's attention to detail is amazing For me, the most chilling scene in the movie is the death of an American officer It's one of the most intimate It's also a slightly confusing moment because two German characters resemble each other so greatlyToward the middle, a German soldier called ""Steamboat Willie"" is introduced By the end of the film, he has become the 'bad' German Later in the movie, another German is involved in the final fight He takes part in an exceedingly painful scene of hand-to-hand combat with the American soldier The two German soldiers have similar short haircuts and black uniforms Because they looked so much alike, many of us have believed that they're one character They're not, and the distinction of the two is very significant"
ccthemovieman-1,"Feb 27, 2006",10/10,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film.It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."
TheLittleSongbird,"Mar 15, 2009",8/10,"This is definitely one of the more powerful war films out there, if not the most powerful. I will admit, when I first saw it at school, I found the first half-hour extremely upsetting to watch.The acting is outstanding. Especially from Tom Hanks and Matt Damon, and the music alongside Schindler's List is John William's most haunting score I've heard.It does drag in the middle and the dialogue doesn't always flow as well as it should, but what we have is a historically accurate, extremely well made and directed and unashamedly brutal film. I mean, in the stabbing scene, towards the end, my English teacher had to leave the room. It was like watching Frankenstein's monster tearing out Elizabeth's heart.8.5/10 for a truly emotional and appropriately sombre war-film, that is a little slow at times. But it deserves to be in the top 250, really it is that good! Bethany Cox"
helpless_dancer,"Apr 15, 2000",10/10,"The opening beach assault sequences were the most violent, realistic, and upsetting filming I've ever seen; looked as though the thing was actual combat footage. The shushing noises of rounds cutting through the air was the most chilling part of all. Perfect portrayal of the insane stupidity of war and the anguish of all who enter this most foolish of enterprises. A must see."
Xophianic,"Feb 2, 2000",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan is, without a doubt, the best war movie ever made and one of the best movies of all time. I wasn't sure what I would think of this movie before I saw it. I heard the gore and carnage was too much, and I heard the story and action was great.When I finally did see it, I loved it. The gore wasn't as bad, in my opinion, as everyone said it was. I thought the battles scenes were fantastically done. They were entertaining to watch, but with a certain sadness to it. I also think the moments of reflection among the soldiers was very good too. You got to hear their thoughts about the enemy, the soldiers and the war itself.The acting was great, especially by Tom Hanks. Tom Hanks certainly deserved the Academy Award for best actor, even though he did not get it. Matt Damon also did a great job as Private Ryan. Watch for a great cameo-like performance by Ted Danson.The storyline was interesting. Most of all, it showed what the war was like and how horrible it was. Some of the American soldiers were killed before they even entered the battlefield, some before they could even fire back, and some went down in a blaze of glory. Either way, you felt pity for the Americans and hatred for the Nazis.The mission the soldiers were on was to find a single man, Private Ryan, and bring him home, because all of his brothers were killed and he was the last male survivor of the family. You, along with the soldiers in the movie, will always be thinking about whether it is worth it to risk eight lives to save one man. Many things happen through the film that will keep changing your mind about it.If blood, guts and gore bothers you, you really should not watch Saving Private Ryan. Otherwise, I recommend going out and buying it right away. You will not be disappointed."
AnimeChica,"Mar 21, 2006",10/10,"This movie is so powerful. I couldn't watch it without crying, jumping, gasping, screaming, laughing, and cringing. It brought you through a whole array of emotion.I couldn't help but give my entire being over to each character as a stunning performance was drawn by each actor. Simply amazing. I can't describe it any other way.Easily the best war film I've seen. None was more realistic... Amazing amazing amazing.Recommended to anyone who enjoys historical fiction.LOVED IT!"
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Mar 16, 2004",10/10,"I'm starting to think that everything that Speilberg touches turns to gold. This is probably considered one of the greatest movies of all time and it is directed by Speilberg. The movie is incredable. The beginning was horrifying. I couldn't believe how accurate it was and painful it was to watch. When I studied WW2 in high school, I thought no one could ever re-create the Beach of Normady. But Speilberg did. I felt like I was there with the soldiers. I felt their fear, pride, and love for their country. I couldn't believe how much dedication our armies put into fighting and winning the war. And whenever I go to visit Washington D.C., I have more American pride then ever. I am more than proud to give this movie a10/10"
lee_a_scott,"Nov 3, 2007",7/10,"When I first saw this film at the cinema I was, like everyone else in the world, blown away by the opening scenes and then mostly entranced by what followed. Upon re-watching it these years later, the overall effect has been lessened by familiarity and, possibly, by being Speilberged out after watching Munich last week! The battle scenes are still excellent  visceral, terrifying and all too real  conveying the calamitous confusion of war in a way seldom matched in the movies. When the action slows down, so does the film, and this often leaves you feeling a little disinterested as the characters lack of back-story and overly obvious attempts at making them look good (Woo! I've saved a child! Boo! I've been shot!) seem to jar with the realism attained elsewhere. It's still a cracking film though, and the weaker bits have actually stood up better than the strong bits in my opinion (although maybe I'm just more tolerant of schmaltz as I get older)."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 24, 2000",8/10,"There's violence and there's violence. With the huge numbers of personal reviews of this movie, I'm hard pressed to add much. The first half hour affected me like no other in recent years. I wondered as the boys threw up on the amphibious carriers whether they were seasick or scared beyond belief. When one uses the expression ""cannon fodder"" so casually, do we realize that this means the second wave makes it's way to the beach over the dead and dying bodies of the first wave, like ants sacrificing themselves to ford a puddle. The ones that get through, get through because there are only so many bullets and so many people. They are exposed, disoriented, helpless--they have no place to go but ahead. I will be haunted forever by the soldier searching, then finding his dismembered arm in the carnage. I will remember those trying to get above water, only to be cut down below the surface. If anyone has a heart, his or her attitude toward war should never be the same. How can we who have never been there have a hint of what it must have been like. Like Schindler's List on the Holocaust, this should be a training film on war."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Dec 18, 2025",10/10,"Following the deaths of his three brothers in combat, the U. S. Army authorises a dangerous rescue mission to locate and bring home Private James Ryan, the last surviving son of his family.The film shows the different coping strategies men employ in the face of extreme danger: humour, bravado, tears, quiet stoicism. The characters feel genuinely human. Tom Hanks is brilliant, trying to unite an unlikely team while justifying a deadly mission to save one man. From the physical - the tremors and weariness - to the emotional - sheer despair and quiet anguish - Hanks is simply amazing. The supporting cast are excellent, with Giovanni Ribisi and Tom Sizemore standing out among many top-notch performances.The atmosphere is exquisite. You can almost smell the gunfire and feel the mud and rain clinging to your skin. The film is oppressive, tense, and immersive. In spite of the serious tone, there are occasional sprinkles of humour, such as the squad's first effort to brief Private Ryan. The fight sequences feel coldly realistic, not swashbuckling. Every shot conveys danger, exhaustion, and the randomness of survival. Despite running close to three hours, the film never lags. The music is wonderfully fitting - quietly sorrowful and understated, adding to the tense tone.The production values are superb. Sets feel like they've been lifted from a history book, and the clothing looks like it was manufactured in 1944. Most filming was done in Ireland, with Curracloe Beach standing in for Omaha. Village scenes and interiors were filmed nearby and at Pinewood Studios in the UK. Budget clearly was no issue - Spielberg spared nothing.While the story is fictionalised, it's inspired by the real-life Niland brothers, giving the mission a poignant human dimension. The moral hook - risking lives to save one - drives the narrative tension throughout.There's a touch of American chest-beating - the mission to save one man while risking many others is treated as unquestionably noble. A British viewer might quietly think: 'Sorry for your loss, have some tea, and get on with the mission.'The opening twenty minutes are the standout - a brutal, unflinching portrayal of the Omaha Beach landings. Later, the squad hunting through the dog tags of fallen soldiers is chilling, but what really hits is the disgusted looks on the faces of passing soldiers, witnessing this grim task.If you're wanting an epic war movie or simply a piece of cinematic brilliance, this film delivers on every level. It amassed a tonne of awards and acclaim over the years, deservedly so. I can't help but feel sad that some of the values on display here are somehow lost today, gone for good.10/10."
MrsRainbow,"Mar 2, 1999",N/A,"I went to see Saving Private Ryan twice in the theatre. I was very impressed the first time I saw it, and the battle scenes were so haunting that I felt it would be worthwhile going again. While I again enjoyed them, they obviously did not have the same impact as when seen for the first time and this caused me to give greater attention to the remainder of the film. It didn't hold up well.I feel it would have been best for Spielberg to have begun this film right off in the boat. No advance warning, no sentimentality. It would have been perhaps the most amazing first scene in cinematic history. But he had to overdo it. The first graveyard scene can be accepted, though it is undesirable. But the second was insulting, not just to me, but to the film itself and the message it had attempted to convey. He can understate well, as the scene in which Mrs. Ryan is told of the fate of her sons proves.(The rule which is so often broken by film makers today is don't tell, show. But they are so used to talking down to the audience that it is seen as desirable and normal. I see it as manipulative and condescending).It also seemed as if I could actually see the seams in the movie, the transition from one scene to the next. It was obvious that it was _written_. Yes, of course, all screenplays are written. But a truly good film can draw you in to the point where it IS reality. SPR did not do that for me. I'm sure there has already been sufficient comment on the stereotypicality of the characters. And of course the scene in which there is an argument over whether or not to take the child along with them.There is a sense in which films like this are protected from artistic judgment because it is felt that the message they are conveying is so important. I believe this is part of the reason it has received as much praise as it has. While the battle scenes and cinematography are truly magnificent, those things alone are not enough for a film to be considered the greatest film of all time, nor even the greatest war film of all time."
stevenblackburn,"Nov 13, 2001",10/10,"An amazing and compelling insight to warfare. Umbelievable camera shots/angles bring World War 2 to life especially for the US troops on D-Day. The use of flash bullets, and color saturation just add to the effect of a killing ground that not many people survive to come back from."
comstockbd,"Jun 18, 2015",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan is a military movie based during World War II. The movie starts with the invasion of Normandy at what is now known as D Day. Captain Miller, who is played by Tom Hanks, leads his troops onto the beaches of Normandy against the Germans. Once they are able to take the beach, they learn of story of Private James Ryan. James and his other four brothers are scattered throughout Europe battling in World War II. The United States Headquarters learns that all of James's brothers have been killed in action, leaving James the only sibling to survive. The United States Military learns that his mother will be receiving all news that all three of his brothers have been killed in action. In a plot to give his mother some type of comfort, the Military sends Captain Miller and his troops on a hunt to find Private Ryan and tell him what had happened and to get him back home.The theme of the film is courage. Throughout the film the soldiers show tremendous courage in their journey from the beginning until the end. The soldiers had to go through one of the most horrific and bloody battles from World War II and had to show tremendous courage to make it and take the beach. After they took the beach they had to go on a journey in order to find Private Ryan. They had to search throughout Europe to find Ryan while going through several battles and their own battles with each other. They lost many men including Corporal Caparzo. All of those men lost, just so that they could get Private Ryan and send him home to his mother.Lighting and sound effects were two major techniques used in the movie to enhance and capture the attention of the viewer, and to create a very lifelike impersonation of what those scenes were like in real life. When Caparzo was shot by a sniper the scene was very dark, it was raining and there was little visibility for the soldiers due to fog. The surround sound of the rain made it very intense and made it feel as if you were right there. The sound of explosions going off at every corner captures the moments of war that make it horrible to be in. It makes you after these scenes make you think to yourself what it would really be like in a war like that and if that's how it really was.Saving Private Ryan is one of the best military movies of all time. The courage that these men faced with themselves and to find someone that none of them knew was extremely heroic. They made it possible to help with a grieving mother who had lost not one but three sons in the heat of battle in World War II. This movie is a must see so that we can try and understand what these young men and women had to go through and sacrifice in order for us to live in freedom."
beejer,"Aug 20, 1999",10/10,"Together with ""Schindler's List (1993) and ""Platoon"" (1986), ""Saving Private Ryan"" ranks as one of the greatest war movies of all time. Like ""Platoon"" it gives the viewer an ""in the trenches"" experience.Spielberg has hit another home run with this one. The battle scenes are so realistic and gut wrenching that the viewer is left with the impression of what the real battles were actually like. Spielberg conveys the uselessness and futility of war as we follow Tom Hanks and his squad in their search for Private Ryan following a devastating battle on D-Day.Spielberg's two World War II masterpieces, Schindler's List and Saving Private Ryan should be required viewing at the high school level in order to instill in our youth a sense of the sacrifices that were made over a half a century ago in order to preserve our freedom."
hollywood_natedogg,"Aug 28, 2018",9/10,After scrolling through alot of the reviews I see you guys giving. 1/10 HERE ..1/10 THERE..I asked myself how the hell can you be so ignorant..Or maybe the doctor dropped you on the floor when you came out your mommas womb. Saving Private Ryan was not only a well casted work of art. It is one of the only movies to existence that visual provides the horrible anguish of war. DRIVEN by an outstanding performance from Tom Hanks. Its Brutal...Violent...and undoubtedly the most realistic demonstration of war we have ever seen on the big screen. Though this story in the war may be fictional. The war in this story is not. 9/10
Gandalf-2,"Oct 11, 1998",6/10,"Before I saw the film, I have read the comments. Many of You liked Spielberg's new movie. But some of You, mostly from the U.S., write things like ""proud to be an American"" or ""part of American History"" or ""every American should see this movie"".First of all, I want to say that this war must have been pure terror. National Socialism was an indescribably evil disgrace to humanity. Many of You have grandparents who fought proudly against the Germans in World War II, but I (as a 25-year old German) and others have Grandparents who were bombed out of their homes at night and could not get a whole night's sleep ever since. My parents were born during the war, their first baby-impressions were gunshots and explosions - for years! Nowadays, in Germany it still is common to find old, still explodable bombs when building a new house.Second, this is not American history, it is not German history, it is World history - Our history. It is the blackest spot ever to be found in the history of the human race.Third: I don't mean to be rude, but I think that many people have lost the connection to reality. In the first place, making a war movie has two major aspects: Making money (bad) and Reviving History for educational purposes (respectable). But then, feeling history is completely different. In my very neighbourhood, there was a Concentration Camp, only some 53 years ago. I have been to that beach in France, and let me tell You: Just seeing the sea, the sand, the dunes really scared me rigid. Talking with my grandma (she led a baby nursing home in that time), that's history. Just sitting in a movie theatre, listening to SDDS and watching Tom Hanks cry is a different experience.What I want to state here is that there is quite a difference between a movie (may it be as realistic as possible) and real history. This really happened! Millions of people were slaughtered in the most cruel ways! By other people! When I go to my University building, I see the holes in the wall which have been there since the war. They have never been repaired in order to give people something to think about. From exactly that building, Sophie Scholl and her friends threw Anit-Nazi papers into the crowd and got executed only a short time later.I think the film is quite accurate, actually. It is not the most impressive war film I have ever seen (that's  ""The Bridge"" from 1959), but it shows how the war was like. In all aspects. Anyway, how can war films be ""good"" or ""best""? ""Saving Private Ryan"" is an exceptional educational masterpiece, it should be recommended together with ""Schindler's List"", but it is only a movie. It cannot replace reality.So, I recommend this: Watch the movie, everyone! But also think about the real people of any nation that were cruelly murdered in those years, and think about those who lived through it. Even think of those who were with the regime and still walk the earth. Then, book a ticket for Europe, see the Normandie for yourself, see Berlin, see Dresden, see Munich, see the wounds of history. And see that being German is not the same as being a Nazi. After You get home to wherever You come from, I promise, You then will have a different view of reality."
auuwws,"Jun 3, 2020",10/10,"A very cool movie that contains the best movie editorial, a shocking ending, characters that the viewer has to watch, and a great acting representation"
Tony-Kiss-Castillo,"Jan 31, 2024",10/10,"Numbing shock...on a cellular level...motivated me to return to the theater a week later, to experience it again. I was not in the least disappointed. Indulged myself by acquiring the DVD soon after its release and reliving the experience on numerous occasions!In RYAN, Spielberg succeeds in getting inside the viewer's head by immersing us in his ingeniously structured cascading time-lapse glacier of chaos, resulting in a 2½ hour free-fall rush into overwhelming impotence! RYAN seers the hell of war into every pore of your psyche, like no other war movie before or since. Watching it is a delightful exercise in masochistic pleasure.Certainly, anything but war friendly, Spielberg's 1998 classic, the highest rated war themed film in the history of cinema (#24-IMDb Top 250 today), only makes oblique reference to the diabolical nature of the Nazi juggernaut. RYAN tenaciously and consistently drives home the only ""shades of gray"" nature of the nuts and bolts, day-to-day, moment to moment decision options available in the heat of battle! I offer, as an example of this, various moments of onscreen interaction with German prisoner of war, nicknamed ""Steamboat Willie""...Just watch, eventually you will understand!Also, I think a special note of recognition is due to Denise Chamian...If the name doesn't ring a bell, don't feel bad...she did not register with me either! Her name appears for The CASTING Credit of RYAN. Superb job, Ms. Chamian! (Minority Report/Big Fish) She has been nominated on multiple occasions by the Casting Society of America...but RYAN seems to be her only win! (An extremely well deserved one, in my opinion)The Ensemble cast also received a Screen Actors Guild Nomination in that category. After having seen RYAN at least 10 times, I stand firmly by this accolade: One of the BEST Ensemble performances ever!To anyone out there who hasn't seen RYAN, maybe because of its War or Action genre label...This is one hell of a humanistic Greek tragedy that you simply must see! To those of you who have seen it once or twice, but who haven't in years.... Please give it another look...You won't be disappointed in the least...RYAN only gets better with each viewing!ENJOY! / DISFRUTELA!Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are most welcome!"
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 25, 2025",10/10,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is a truly stunning and powerful war film. The thing that struck me the most was its unflinching realism and visceral intensity. That opening D-Day scene on Omaha Beach is a legendary piece of filmmaking; it's a terrifying, chaotic, and completely immersive experience that feels more real than any other war movie I've seen. The cinematography is gritty and raw, putting you right in the middle of the battle. Beyond the action, the film is a deeply emotional and human story about the bonds of brotherhood and the cost of war. It's a gripping and respectful tribute to the soldiers who fought on that day.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is absolutely worth watching. It's a landmark film that completely changed the way war movies were made. It's a powerful and unforgettable cinematic experience that is both a thrilling action film and a deeply moving drama."
CG89gc,"Jan 23, 2022",10/10,"I love Tom Hanks. Just in general. But he is just sooo good at being his character in This movie. The war is just heartbreaking, But they manage in This movie to captivate all the aspects of it. Every character represents some personalities who participated. We Can feel it all through them through the screen. Undescribable. Just beautifully made."
Moocow-3,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,I believe that SAVING PRIVATE RYAN was one of the best war movies ever made because it shows what war is really about.  I have seen tons of movies where violence is portrayed as a cool shoot-em up blow-em up thing.  This movie has a lot of violence but shows the reality of what happened a half -century ago and the horrible brutality of war.  The actors were fabulous in recreating the war.  Not to mention the battle scenes were perfect.  Steven Spielberg has done an excellent job of recreating the events of Omaha Beach in the first 24 minutes of the film.  This movie shows war in its most truthful sense.  It made me stop and think just how many people died horrible deaths to save our country.  It made me want to cry like few movies do.  This movie is the closest you will get to seeing what life was like during WWII.
memy,"Mar 10, 2005",10/10,"This is truly the best war movie i've ever seen!!! Eerytime I watch it I cannot stop crying, I get goosebumps only by thinking of it; what makes it so special is that ""Private Ryan"" seems to have learned the lesson: ""EARN THIS!"", it seems that he truly respected a dying man's wish. About the scenes in the movie, I played the computer game ""Medal of Honor - Allied Assault"" and I was surprised to see a lot of the movie scenes in the game (Normandy, Sniper city - Caparzo, The bridge) or vice versa. I don't have to tell you that MOHAA is my favorite Computer game ever. All the respect to the genius of Steven Spielberg (I mean it's like he was there)Bottom line: if you haven't seen it yet, YOUR GREAT LOSS"
Hustle-Informer,"Mar 27, 2023",10/10,"Alright, folks, gather 'round because I just watched ""Saving Private Ryan,"" and oh boy, do I have some thoughts! Directed by the legendary Steven Spielberg and released in 1998, this movie is a jaw-dropping, heart-pounding, and tear-jerking depiction of World War II. Let me tell you, it's like no other war film I've ever seen.So, the story is about a group of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (played by the ever-impressive Tom Hanks), who are on a mission to find and bring home this guy, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). This poor dude has already lost all his brothers in the war, and now he's the last one left.Now, let me tell you, the opening scene is an absolute doozy! It's a no-holds-barred, in-your-face portrayal of the D-Day invasion of Normandy. It's intense, gory, and downright horrifying, but it's also incredibly gripping. I was on the edge of my seat, eyes glued to the screen, heart pounding in my chest.Tom Hanks is, as always, a freakin' treasure. He plays the role of Captain Miller with such depth and vulnerability that it's impossible not to feel for the guy. And the rest of the cast? Top-notch! They bring these soldiers to life with such raw emotion and camaraderie that you can't help but root for them.What I loved most about this movie was the balance between edge-of-your-seat action and heart-wrenching character development. I was totally invested in these characters, their stories, and the friendships that were forged in the crucible of war. Spielberg nailed it, showing us the devastating emotional toll war takes on the human soul.Oh, and let's not forget the phenomenal cinematography and sound design! The camera work is chaotic and disorienting, perfectly mirroring the confusion and terror on the battlefield. And the sound? Let's just say you might want to make sure your neighbors are cool with the sound of gunfire and explosions because it's that intense!Sure, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has its flaws. The pacing can be a bit slow here and there, and some of the characters' motivations could be fleshed out a bit more. But honestly, these are just minor gripes in an otherwise spectacular film.In conclusion, if you haven't seen ""Saving Private Ryan"" yet, what the heck are you waiting for?! This movie is a gut-wrenching, heart-stopping, and unforgettable experience that'll leave you speechless. It's a must-watch, folks, so grab some popcorn, brace yourself, and get ready for one heck of a ride!"
yeti-28,"Apr 18, 2006",10/10,"i first saw this movie on T.V. one night with my father, but only saw bits and pieces. I decided to rent it one night and watched the whole thing in my basement. From the start to the finish i thoroughly enjoyed the movie.i had seen a couple other world war two movies, but none of them compared to this. it was interesting how Spielberg made everything look like it was back then, with the costumes, weapons and scenery!!! overall, this movie seemed like one of the best out there, and i personally think it's spielbergs best. If you haven't seen it yet, then i HIGHLY recommend you go out and rent it some time. It's a great movie and definitely worth watching!"
clong_clong,"Jan 23, 2004",8/10,"I really liked this movie ! the realism was extreme, what is, I think a good thing. I do not like Spielberg (since i was 14-15 yrs old anyway). I think this guy would be better in doing commercials for TV than making movie - just my humble opinion. But if we forget some flaws the movie is pretty good ! T. Hanks was also very good in it ! he got my respect.now, some stuff was bothering :near the beginning, why spielberg was making the little french girl say "" i don't like those american soldiers ! -sob- "" Are those US dudes will stop one day to think that the french are genetically antiamerican ? that's ridiculous ! I hate set ideas !The german soldiers look dumb and wanting very eagerly take some US slug in the map ! Come on, guys ! The germans are just there to be shooted, they act stupidly what cost them their life, they have no survivng instinct ... i don't buy it !The landing scene seemed ended a little too fast and easily to match the reality i think (IMHO)Of course, there may be a little too much US patriotism for the average european viewer, we are not used to it anymore in our countries (self-glorification, i mean) but after all it's an american movie and they did change the fate of Europe and the world, so ... let them do it.anyway good movie, i give it a 8/10.= you should at least see it once ! >"
london-adrian-1,"Sep 9, 2005",8/10,"...if Spielberg had resisted the urge to tack a big set piece on to the last 30 minutes.Imagine watching the same movie except this time it ends at the point that they catch up with Private Ryan.Up to that point Spielberg had shown such restraint and subtlety it was disappointing to see it had been thrown away for a silly crowd pleaser. The first 30 minutes of Saving Private Ryan clearly demonstrates the sheer horror of war as well as the lives that are wasted in a way that no previous movie had even attempted.The last 30 minutes on the other hand seem to follow the usual approach, glamorising the whole experience with all the usual heroics and bittersweet sentimentality that we have seen in a thousand war movies before.Still having said that, this is still an excellent movie and is well worth watching."
tarunjg,"Apr 11, 2005",10/10,"This movie will rank in the top 100 movies of all time for years and years to come. Why? Because it helps shows war with real decency. No one would want to watch a movie with only killing, blood and gore. No one really does. This movie manages to let us, the viewers, watch virtually a firsthand take of what veterans went through.The acting was phenomenal. Tom Hanks was at his best yet, with superb realism which he displayed. Good job to others: Tom Sizemore, Edward Burn, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, and of course Vin Diessel.The Director: Steven Spielberg directed the best movie he ever made. This movie was unbelievably realistic. I know that throughout this movie, I did not and could not possibly think about anything that might take me away from the movie. In fact, the whole time I imagined that this was not a movie, that it really occurred.The music director: John Williams made one of the best of Alltime. The beautiful piece: Hymn to the Fallen Soldiers raises the goosebumps from your arms. Extremely good job with that. Revisiting Normandy and others also were profoundly beautiful. The sound was amazing. The sound of the tanks rolling, warfare, bullets under water, etc. really super sized this movie. The sound tanks in this movie got me scared.This movie clearly should have won best movie, and best actor.I loved it and watch it once every month, which I simply can not elude."
cannibalsnowman,"Mar 19, 2005",10/10,"Up until this day, there had never been a time where I was awestruck or shocked or amazed after seeing a movie. Never. Then, I saw Saving Private Ryan. This movie, without a doubt, is the best movie I have ever seen.Saving Private Ryan is a very accurate presentation of World War 2. In a lot of the parts, I felt like I was actually there. It was all thanks to Spielburg's camera-work, which showed some scenes of the movie from the view of a soldier. I felt like I was running along the beaches of Normandy. I felt like I was with them in the final battle (won't reveal specifics). That's how good it was! Now, even though this movie is really good, it is not for the faint of heart. The first scene of this movie (D-Day) contains gratuitous amounts of violence and gore. They do not hold back on the violence. So, unless you think you can handle it, I would not recommend seeing this movie, because it does have some very disturbing moments. Another thing they do not hold back on is swearing. If soldiers shouting out the f-word constantly doesn't appeal to you, then you might want to skip this movie.Besides all of that, this is a great film! I can't think of anything wrong with it at all. I would definitely recommend this movie (if you can handle the gore and language)."
gottogorunning,"Aug 9, 2005",10/10,"I can not understand those who view it as an 'America win the War' movie. That is not the point of most of the war movies out there. Yes, they may use American actors and show American fighting, but look past that and see the terrifying experiences of war and the fear of the people back home who suffer the emotional trauma. 'Saving Private Ryan' I felt gave a visual look at war, it gave the best feeling of what war would be like that any movies have given, but I don't think that any movie ever will be able to to give the exact fear that is within the people when they are in the middle of a battlefield.An excellent movie, dignified, moving and intelligent (not a word used with many Hollywood movies) acting with a director that has shown everyone how it SHOULD be done."
Trashman-4,"May 8, 2000",N/A,"Very good film - the landing sequence at the start was phenomenal. The acting was of a uniformly high standard. A couple of things spoiled the film a bit for me.The Germans are treated as 'Nazis', even when most Wermacht soldiers were just serving their country like everybody else. Also they seemed to be targets that got mown down in droves and were generally portrayed as less than human. I thought that went out in cinema a few years after the war ended.Finally the only mention of the other allies is one disparaging comment about Montgomery's failure in front of Caen. Firstly he was facing most of the German armour that was dug into strongpoints, and secondly on D-Day and for a period after the British and Canadian troops out numbered the Americans. I wouldn't normally bother but Americans seem to view these films as historically accurate representations.With the release of U571 this trend is getting even worse. The capture of the Enigma machine was carried out by a British destroyer crew - before America even entered the war!The new Colditz movie is following this path. There were very few American POW's held there, and none of those escaped by the war's end."
jnaradzay,"Jul 1, 2005",10/10,"D-Day. Operation Overlord. What we say here cannot do justice to what they did on that day. Tom Hanks and his patrol must recover Private James Ryan before his mother gets her fourth flag delivered by an Army chaplain. It all makes perfect, illogical sense to kill many to save one.After surviving the Normandy landing, Hanks is volunteered to put his men in the line of fire again and again. Just to save one man.Or is it?A bridge is saved, a town is secured, a bigger battle is won..All because Hanks saved one shoe for one horse...Beautifully realistic to make the atrocities of war invade, assault, and overpower all five senses. You feel the bullets whizzing past your head. You see the man looking for his arm after it was blown off is shoulder. You smell the burning hatred for the Nazis as one US soldier yells to his comrades ""Don't shoot them..let them burn.""It is too much to watch..but you have to see it."

Wuchakk,"Jul 7, 2016",6/10,"RELEASED IN 1998 and directed by Steven Spielberg, ""Saving Private Ryan"" (SPR) is about the Normandy invasion and its immediate aftermath from June 6-16, 1944. The focus is on a Captain (Tom Hanks) and his men who are commissioned to find a paratrooper (Matt Damon) whose brothers have been killed in action.No one's supposed to say anything bad about SPR. To do so is considered sacrilege, but I have to be honest about what I like and don't like about Spielberg's popular WWII war flick. The initial beach landing (shot at Curracloe Beach, Ballinesker, Ireland) is outstanding, as is the closing half-hour battle at the crumbling village of Ramelle.In between these two great bookends are a few quality sequences, but I didn't find a lot of the drama all that engaging or convincing. The cast is notable (also including Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Vin Diesel, et al.), but the characters never struck me as real for the most part. I've seen the film three times and each time I was too often conscious of the fact that I was watching actors portraying WWII characters in a movie. When you see a truly great picture, by contrast, you completely forget you're watching a movie, e.g. the original ""Apocalypse Now"" (1979).Moreover, too many of the situations in SPR, including the dialogue, simply struck me as unreal or annoyingly treacly. Exhibit A is the moronic dog-tag sequence, which was supposed to be emotionally stirring but just made me roll my eyes. But, like I said, no one can criticize SPR and get away with it, even if the criticism is legitimate. It's like you'll be accused of being un-American or something, which is far from the case with me since I love America; I just can't stand the corrupt government & politicians, particularly the loony DemonKKKraps.In light of my criticisms, I simply don't get why so many praise SPR as ""the greatest war movie ever made."" Again, the opening and ending battle sequences are great but the dubious dramatics leave quite a bit to be desired.I've heard SPR hailed on the grounds that much of it was taken ""verbatim from first-hand, eye-witness accounts of the real Normandy invasion."" I'll take their word for it, but this isn't what I object to. I object to the contrived, sappy, questionable way Spielberg depicted the dramatics and the fact that I was unable to buy the characters as real. The aforementioned dog-tag sequence is just one example, others include the French father's stupefying actions and the forced fight at the radar station and how it's resolved (ooh, the Captain's a high school teacher, whoopee).Nevertheless, there IS a lot of good in SPR that makes it worth viewing. You can't beat the battle sequences, the cast and the convincing WWII visuals throughout.THE MOVIE RUNS 2 hours, 49 minutes and was shot in Ireland, England and France.

dfloro,"Jun 7, 2024",9/10,"One of, if not THE single greatest movie Steven Spielberg has ever made (the only other motion picture even in the running is ""Schindler's List,"" his other dramatic epic set in WWII). I just saw it on TCM for a 3rd or 4th time (I had originally seen this in a giant-screened movie theater at its premiere), and I'm always moved by the final scenes. First, a dying Capt. John Miller (played by Tom Hanks) pulls in Pvt. Jimmy Ryan (played in the June 1944 scenes by a young actor, Matt Damon) to his lips to whisper his last words in his ear, ""Earn this!"" Then Director Spielberg morphs the 25-year-old face of Damon into an elderly face at the French cemetery for U. S. war casualties 50-60 years later, where James Ryan emotionally hopes aloud that he's been a good enough man over the lifetime of his extended family to be able to say to the Captain that he's ""earned it."" I never don't cry at this scene, and for this, along with numerous other reasons (not the least of which is the handheld camerawork in the opening Normandy beach landing scene done by Director Spielberg himself), I reiterate my firm belief in this film's sublime greatness! I rate this revered film as a strong 9.5 out of 10!"
ascofield,"Nov 17, 2001",10/10,"Winning 5 Academy Awards Saving Private Ryan is without doubt one of the greatest war movies of all time. Director Steven Spielberg does an excellent job with this film. The choreography,  film editing, sound, and directing are superb. Specially the D-Day scene, which veterans called a precise re-creation of the real landing on Normandy. Along is the powerful cast of Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg and Vin Diesel which makes the movie even better. The greatest war film of all time and one of the best films over all."
eslam4330,"Aug 28, 2018",10/10,This film is an absolute masterpiece. It shows that war isn't always glamorous. Steven Spielberg won a Best Directing Oscar for his work on this film and the film went on to win four others. It is gritty and bloody and it shows that wars aren't won by weapons but by soldiers. The cast shine as the group of soldiers tasked with finding Private Ryan. Along the way they encounter the harsh truth and real meaning of war. It boasts impressive battle sequences and the stylish cinematography makes the film truly beautiful. The opening beach sequence is possibly the greatest opening scenes in movies. Tom Hanks is spell binding as the commander who has no idea about the harsh truth of war. Overall a truly amazing film.
kreth,"Jan 2, 2000",10/10,"This film is absolutely the most realistic war movie ever made.  Some people have panned it because it doesn't show enough of the efforts of the other Allied Forces.  It wasn't about the Allied effort, it was about Saving Private Ryan.  Some people even called the Allies the Axis.  How can you take their comments seriously, when they don't know the good guys from the bad guys.  Tom Hanks was remarkable as the Ranger Captain, although it is hard to picture a forty something Captain leading an assault team on D-Day. 10 out of 10."
rkeaney,"Apr 12, 2006",9/10,"I will just start off with saying that this is an excellent movie. Tom Hanks' character is superb as he again proves that he is one of the best actors still going today.The direction is magnificent, bravo Steven Spielberg who shows that war is absolutely not glamorous. Spielberg can enthrall audiences like no other.The battle on Omaha beach was powerful ,extraordinary stuff.We start this movie with the attack on Omaha beach, D-day 1944.Captain John.H.Miller(Tom Hanks)leads his regiment up on to the sands meanwhile being bombarded by Nazi gunmen.When Omaha Beach is seized by the American and British forces John is asked to embark on a mission to save a soldier who's three brothers had just died and who now has a ticket home to his grieving mother.John agrees and begins the task of saving Private Ryan all the while his regiment wonder why they must risk their lives to save one man.This is a great movie but very intense and powerful.The battle scenes are superb.A definite must see for any lover of great movies.Go watch this movie one of the best in its genre. 10/10 - Unmissable"
ReelCheese,"Feb 18, 2007",9/10,"The genius of Steven Spielberg is that he always knows exactly where he wants to take his audience, and then takes them there. If he wants to tug at our heartstrings, he'll make us fall in love with a brown and wrinkly space visitor we might otherwise find grotesque. If he wants to make us inch the blanket up over our eyes, he'll crank up the grim orchestral music and put us face-to-face with a toothy Great White. And if he wants us to truly understand an entirely different kind of horror, he'll show us small children leaping into a pool of outhouse waste to escape their murderous Holocaust captors.Spielberg continues what he does best with SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, a film so graphic in its Second World War battlefield depictions that many veterans have called it the closest thing to being there. The explicit scenes of gushing arteries, severed limbs and faceless corpses come fast and furious, numbing us into the reality of the setting. In fact, if we didn't know Spielberg as a serious artist with noble objectives, we might be tempted to call him a shock artist obsessed with blood and guts and gore.But we do know about Spielberg. We know he would not take us down such a rocky road without a reason. In SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, the obvious rationale is to help us understand not where he's coming from, but where the men we will ultimately spend nearly three hours with are coming from. It's in this hell on earth that Cpt. John Miller (Tom Hanks) and his small group of soldiers (fine actors like Edward Burns, Tim Sizemore and Barry Pepper among them) must not only survive with sanity intact, but carry out orders. And not all of those orders make sense at the time, if ever. Case in point, Hanks and his men are sent to locate one Pte. James Ryan (Matt Damon). Pte. Ryan is no POW, but a soldier still serving somewhere within the vast U.S. Forces -- if he's still alive, that is. During the Second World War, with a communication system that is a technological dinosaur by today's standards, it's a mission ordered said than accomplished.The mission is a tough sell not just logistically, but emotionally. Pte. Ryan is sought so he can be sent home to his mom, who has just lost her three other sons virtually at once. As he himself admits, Pte. Ryan has displayed no more courage than his fellow soldiers. Why should he get to leave? Indeed that question crops up in the minds of Hanks' soldiers. Why is one man's life worth risking those of a group of men? they ask. It's an interesting angle for a film about heroes. We often think of soldiers doing the job with no questions asked, happy to put their lives on the line for their fellow GI. We forget they are rational humans.And therein lies one of the biggest strengths of SAVING PRIVATE RYAN. It's a very human story told in extreme circumstances. It covers all the traditional bases -- inner turmoil, terror, carnage -- but has a level of sophistication absent from most other war films, particularly those inspired by The Last Great War. Hanks isn't Patton, but a schoolteacher who secretly cries at the enormity of it all. The enemy fighters don't have horns, but uniforms and feelings just like the Americans. The soldiers are heroes, but reluctant ones.Spielberg is a master at telling the story of war and men. SAVING PRIVATE RYAN is not his best, but it certainly comes close."
highkite,"Jul 25, 2006",9/10,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies you can't believe didn't win the picture Oscar. That didn't stop it though from reaching such a huge audience and touch the lives of millions. The movie has one of the best introductions ever put on screen. The attack on D-Day is immensely powerful and painfully well directed. Steven Spielberg knows exactly how to make this movie strong and action-driven while focusing on the psychology on the characters and the cruelty of war.The movie is about 8 men searching for a soldier by the name of James Ryan (Matt Damon), who's the last of four brothers still left alive. After the attack of D-Day most of the soldiers still suffer the war syndrome and seem very doubtful of finding one person in a whole war-zone. Back at home, Ryan's mother gets a letter about three out of four of her sons dying in war, and begs the soldiers to find her last one.It's a beautiful film that depicts war as it should be. Vicious, disgusting, violent, heartbreaking, unfair, and tragic. Spielberg's use of the hand-held camera is almost breathtaking, as he gets right into the action and swings left and right to create a sense of realism and panic. His incredible editing and beautiful cinematography is unforgettable and is strongly influential.Tom Hanks gives an incredible performance as Captain John Miller, a dedicated and loyal soldier who's on the verge of losing his mind. The pressure from being a captain and enduring the worst attack in history sends him in mental torture, trying to covering his pain and suffering from the rest of the soldiers.The story doesn't focus on the heroic aspect, but rather the truth about war. Spielberg knows that even though you get to know the characters, they have a chance of dying. There is a unique subtlety in that these characters seem to have the drive to save private Ryan so they could go home.Definitely one of the best directed films in a long time, ""Saving Private Ryan"" is a bright gem in recent film-making. Robbed of the Picture Oscar, the movie is a true representation of D-Day and post D-Day. It's a movie that inspires above all else."

If it were to come out present day, I would believe it to be a substantial contender for Best Picture.This film is just as thrilling now as it was when I first saw it in theaters. It's also a pleasure to see once emerging actors now excelling in Hollywood, such as Vin Diesel and Tom Hardy!"
langerston,"Aug 9, 2021",10/10,"A Massive Success
When Saving Private Ryan originally released in late summer of 1998, it was met with a massive amount of critical acclaim, even winning 4 Academy Awards . No movie before had ever come so close to capturing the horrific nature of modern warfare on screen. Even now, twenty-two years later, the film is still considered to be unparalleled in terms of both the authenticity of its battle sequences, as well as the grand scale that they are depicted on. Today I want to talk about why this movie is so beloved by both the veterans who have served our country, and the everyday people who never have: to explore in depth why so many consider Private Ryan to be one of the greatest achievements in American filmmaking, and to reflect on why movies like this have a place in our society.Reverence for The Fallen
When watching Ryan for the first time, there were several things that immediately stood out to me. The very first image you see is of the American flag waving about in a slight breeze. This serves to remind us that without what we are about to see, life as we know it would be vastly different, and that without the knowledge of how much we went through to attain our freedom, we run the risk of forgetting the price we paid, and the lives lost in pursuit of that freedom. Instead of jumping immediately into the opening landing sequence, we are given a chance to watch a veteran walk about slowly in a graveyard with thousands of tombstones; a less personal look at the horrors we are about to experience. Before the movie was released, a select group of surviving veterans were taken to screen the film. Not many of them were able to finish. In fact, almost 75% of them walked out within the first 20 minutes, all of them unable to handle what they were seeing, as it reminded them so strongly of what they had experienced more than 50 years prior. As sad as this is, it speaks to the films ability to communicate the awful reality of war.No Holding Back
And man, does this movie show that reality.Within the first half hour of this 3 hour long film, you come to understand what Spielberg was setting out to do with Saving Private Ryan. The second these brave men land on Omaha Beach, they are absolutely annihilated by enemy fire as they desperately run to try and find cover. Men dive over the sides of their boats and end up drowning in an attempt to escape the withering, laser-like accuracy of the evil above them, situated inside impenetrable concrete bunkers. We see a soldier calmly walk over and collect a severed limb. We see a man blown in half, blood pouring out of a massive chest wound. Hundreds upon hundreds of brave soldiers lose their friends to the merciless machine-gun fire. But they keep going. They keep gaining ground. They will not be stopped whatever the cost, because they are fighting for something bigger than themselves. But the horrors continue. A soldier is relieved to find out that a near fatal round merely grazed his helmet, only to be immediately shot in the head when he takes it off to inspect it. Two field medics try desperately to rescue a wounded soldier, only to fail when the man is hit in the head even after their attempts to help him succeed. No other film about war has quite reached the same level of intensity and realism depicted in this sequence. And even as the film continues on and creates fictional stories, the heart and soul of its mission is to depict the incredible consequences of armed warfare, and it does so flawlessly.Incredible Filmmaking
But while noble intentions are respectable, they don't always signify a great movie. Thankfully, Saving Private Ryan succeeds on the front of expert moviemaking. The cinematography is absolutely stunning to look at. Wide shots lend a sense of epic scope, while close ups and slow motion in the opening and closing battle sequences serve to highlight the claustrophobic feeling of combat. Beautiful vistas are never far away from the eye of the camera, and neither are scenes where grit seems to seep through the edges of the screen. Spielberg utilizes a handheld camera in certain sequences to add to the shaky, stressed feeling of terror that the soldiers no doubt possessed. The weapons, equipment, and tactics throughout are totally authentic as well, adding to the sense of immersion. The sound design only adds to the phenomenal presentation, with extremely realistic effects. Every time a grenade goes off, a cacophonous explosion will make you flinch, and the gunfire (especially in the opening sequence) serves to heighten the tension even more. Because of this, Ryan won the Academy award for ""Best Sound Editing/Mixing."" The writing too helps to lend a sense of authenticity to the dialogue. The acting in the film is absolutely spot-on, and won Tom Hanks the Academy Award for ""Best Actor in a Leading Role"" for 1998.A Serious Subject
Along with heaps of critical praise, Saving Private Ryan was also criticized by some as being ""Too violent."" Allow me to reiterate that this is not the do-a-roll-while-shooting-a-guy-in-the-eyeball glamorized violence of something like the John Wick movies, but realistic war violence on a realistic scale depicting real battles. Yes, the movie may be rated for ""Intense prolonged realistically graphic sequences of war violence"", and that is because it is realistically graphic and intense. The intensity of the combat depicted is meant to make the viewer appreciate the monstrous cost of the lives lost at the allied beachhead, and I think it does so effortlessly.In Summary
Saving Private Ryan is a modern classic, depicting war how it is while breathing life into a time period that is often hard to capture on film. While not to be encountered lightly, Private Ryan is an exemplary showcase of modern day American filmmaking, and shall be appreciated for decades to come."
bilirof,"Dec 4, 2021",10/10,"Steven Spielbergs ""Der Soldat James Ryan"" spielt in den Tagen der Invasion der alliierten Streitmächte in der französischen Normandie am 6. Juni 1944, die zur richtungsweisenden Schlacht auf dem Wege zum Sieg gegen das nationalsozialistische Deutschland werden sollte. Die ersten dreißig Minuten des Films konzentrieren sich auf den Moment der Landung in der Normandie und zeigen ihn aus der Perspektive der amerikanischen Soldaten, die als erste ihren Fuß auf französischen Boden setzten."
ewancallan,"Feb 22, 2021",10/10,"This movie is just one of the best I have ever seen! The scenes are just soo well shot and they managed to really capture the reality of war and how horrific it is ! You are constantly on the edge of your seat as the group set out to find private ryan, going through many obstacles for just one person... no spoilers ! It's a must watch film. hanks is just unbelievable and fits his role perfectly! I honestly can't think of anyone else that could have done his role as well as he did ! If you haven't seen it, then I highly advise you take the time to watch this cinematic masterpiece !"
ala-49478,"Jun 17, 2021",10/10,"This is one of the few movies I can rewatch a million time and still have an emotional reaction.I've watched many war movies, especially the classics and this is up there with all the best. I'm glad it wasn't made now as the war films in 2020's have all had too much CGI."
dbdumonteil,"Sep 14, 2003",6/10,"War movies have often been one of Steven Spielberg' specialities. This one achieved a huge public and critic success. What drew the attention in this war movie are fight sequences. They're extremely violent and bloody. We have been rarely so far in the reality of fights. It's difficult to forget the first half an hour of the movie during the Normandy landings. Spielberg's sober and showy directing increases the phenomenon.However, you must admit it, the movie is based on a trite, plain even conventional story. You could use this last word to describe the famous Ryan soldier. Indeed, he's told that he can go home because all his brothers have been killed. Instead, he wants to keep on fighting.Apart from this and in spite of a few weaknesses, ""saving private Ryan"" is a thrilling war movie."
I.K,"Aug 31, 1999",1/10,"Visually, the best WW2 movie. In other ways, far from the best. The movie is loaded with errors and falls into demonizing the German soldier and praising the American. A few examples, far from the reality the combat scenes show the Germans acting like cattle without ANY strategy at all they just run and shout, one funny part is the behavior of the German tankers, they drive in a ruined village in a VERY narrow street, like they have never heard of ambush! -One starts to think if the script writer has ever heard ofthe capabilities of the German panzer crews, SS-Captain Michael Wittmann attacked and destroyed 48 armored fighting vehicles alone in a single action! The most absurd part is the -""Macgyver/Rambo scene""-when Capt. Miller and friends start to throw the mortar grenades slaughtering a few dozen Germans. The most unforgivable error is that there were NO SS-units with Tiger tanks operational in Normandy at this point of time. This movie is way overestimated."
pct03,"Jan 6, 2023",10/10,"I remember when I watched the infamous opening scene of the Omaha beach invasion in my Grade 10 civics class in the spring of 2019, and seeing and hearing the reactions of classmates around me. It's a moment I'll never forget, as much as I have finally seen the movie in it's entirety recently. Seeing such a beautifully grim but brutally realistic action sequence put to film awestruck me, and I always had a burning desire to see this movie.Well after playing a few classic Call of Duty campaigns and ultimately gathering more knowledge (and humbling myself) about WWII, I can say this was a tremendous experience. Yes this film has some inaccuracies, but the pure heart, passion and history radiating from this production turned me into a huge fan of war movies, and being keen about learning of war and the sacrifices of our soldiers more than before.I always stood with everybody in the Remembrance Day assemblies in school and I knew of the sacrifices of my fellow citizens in participating in the wars of my country's past, however it wasn't until my latest binge of WWII related medias which truly exposed my eager mind to the terrors of combat, and the ultimate price our world had to pay for our human conflicts. And this amazing film is one of the things that has helped me formulate my utter respect and gratefulness for every man or woman that sacrifices their humanity and potentially their life to fight for victory."

matthewscrugham,"Jul 28, 2021",10/10,"This movie literally has you crying before it's 5 minutes in. From then on, it shows you raw, unrestrained war for the next 2 hours and 45 minutes.

The movie gives you such a real look into each soldiers life that it feels like you know each one personally. The entire cast gives amazing performances, and Spielberg does his thing to make yet another masterpiece.I don't have a personal story involving me or a family member regarding the events of this movie like many people do, so I can't relate to it in that way.

antonperehodenko,"Jan 25, 2022",10/10,"Without looking, I am sure other reviewers here have headlined their article ""Best War Movie Ever Made"""" and I agree. However, before briefly discussing the film, let me just say if you don't have a decent 5.1 surround sound system, you aren't going to fully appreciate this movie (DVD).It's a great film to start with, and sitting in a room surrounded by five speakers with bullets flying from all directions around you - as in that spectacular 22- minute opening scene or in the final 45 minutes of action against the Germans in tanks - is an astounding movie experience. The sound in this film elevates it even higher.The visuals are outstanding, too. I've never seen so many grays, beiges and olive-greens look this good: perfect colors for the bombed-out French city where the last hour takes place, perfect for the faces and uniforms of the gritty soldiers, for the machinery, the smoke-filled skies, etc.My only complaint is the usage of Lord's name in vain 25-30 times, but, hey, when you consider it's tough men in tough times, that's what you are going to hear. In real life, the profanity probably was worse than the film.It's hard to picture the brutality of war being any worse than you see here, but it probably was. This is about as graphic as it gets. The violence and gore was shocking when this film came out in 1997 and still is when watched almost a decade later. It's unbelievable what some of the WWII soldiers went through, but that can be said for any war. I believe the purpose of this film was to pay tribute to the sacrifices these men made, and it succeeds wonderfully. Hats off to Steven Spielberg and to Tom Hanks, the leading actor in here, both of whom have worked hard for WWII vets to get the recognition they deserve, not just on film but in a national memorial.Anyway, language or blood and guts aside, this is still an incredible portrait of WWII. The almost-three hour film is riveting start-to-finish, especially with that memorable beginning action scene, probably the most dramatic in the history of film.As ""entertaining"" as those action scenes were, I found the lulls, if you will, to be even better. Listening to Hanks and his men discuss various things as they look for Private Ryan, was fascinating to me. Hanks is just superb in here and once again shows why he is considered one of the best actors in his generation.The most memorable and powerful moment among the ""lulls,"" is the shot early on of the Ryan mother sinking to her knees on her front porch as she realizes she is about to get disastrous news from the war. Moments later, Harve Presenell, playing Gen. MacArthur, eloquently reads a letter by Abraham Lincoln that is so beautifully written, so profound that it is quoted near the end of the film, too, and I never get tired of hearing it.This is a man's movie, and shows the horrors of war as few others ever have. To say it is ""memorable,"" just doesn't do it justice. It is the greatest war movie ever made....period."
theskylabadventure,"Feb 6, 2007",7/10,"The best thing I can say about this movie is that it is passable entertainment which, if you know anything about The 'Berg's intention for the film, was not the point. This movie was released to overwhelmingly consistent reviews which frequently referred to it as ""one of the best war movies ever made"". Imagine my disgust when I saw it...The opening battle is undeniably brilliant in terms of putting you in the middle of the action/horror, but it relies solely on Spielberg's ability to push the right buttons and is almost totally ineffective on second viewing.Personally, I knew this film was going to be a disaster pretty early on. To be precise, I knew it when, in the midst of this mind-blowing battle sequence, Spielberg thought it'd be fun to throw in a joke about Sizemore being Hanks' mother.WHY?!? He had everyone on the edge of their seat (literally, I remember looking around the theatre and every jaw was dropped) and he decides to lighten the tone by dropping in a fricking JOKE?!?From here the film goes from bad to worse to utter garbage, as we are dragged through a war-is-hell-by-numbers affair. Never one to miss an opportunity to manipulate, Spielberg makes us endure some pretty feeble philosophising, Ted Danson trying to be serious (yes, Ted Danson), a token ""death of the youngest soldier"" tragedy and some of the most sentimentally contrived dialogue I have ever suffered, which never really stood a chance coming from the worst group of two-dimensional characters ever assembled for a movie.Then there's the premise; a group of men is sent across the country to find one guy because good ol' compassionate Uncle Sam thinks the titular soldier's poor Ma has suffered enough in losing her other three sons. Is this a joke?!?""But it's a true story"" I hear you cry. Wrongo! It may have been inspired by a true story, but that doesn't mean that anything beyond the name James Ryan actually existed. The words ""inspired by a true story"" don't mean a thing these days and, let us not forget, this is Spielberg.Let us not forget indeed, as Stevie does inject some excitement and tension into the action set pieces, even if they are overlong, predictable, and dangerously close to many a scene from many a war movie that came before it. The final sequence falls on its arse before it even begins due to the hilarious, A-Team style montage that precedes it, in which we see our apple-pie heroes create a stronghold from various items they find lying around a conveniently deserted village, before the six or so of them defeat an entire platoon of those nasty Germans.Perhaps the worst crime this film committed was being released against Terrence Mallick's 'The Thin Red Line', and subsequently taking the two Oscars which by right belonged to the latter (Best Director and Best Cinematography).'Ryan's Privates' pales in comparison not just to Mallick's film (as well as to Spielberg's other ""classic"" manipulative-therapy session, 'ET') but to almost every war movie I have seen ('Cross of Iron', 'Apocalypse Now', 'Platoon', 'All Quite on the Wetsern Front'), even those which do not profess to be the greatest war epic of all time or even take themselves seriously ('Mash', 'Kelly's Heroes', 'Where Eagles Dare', 'The Eagle Has Landed'). One great battle scene does not a great war movie make, but try telling the Academy that.Bottom line? Don't expect more than a sub-par Spielberg offering and you won't be disappointed. Expect a profoundly moving war classic, and you'll be choking on your rage like I was when I left the cinema nine years ago."
Fiona G.,"Jul 9, 2000",1/10,"This movie serves two purposes: a) glorify the American soldier from World War II and the American nation in general and b) help Mr. Spielberg overcome his own neurosis about being Jewish, a task he started with ""Schindler's List."" That probably makes him the envy of anyone who ever saw a psychologist: to get paid for spreading out your psyche instead of having to pay for it.The first 20 minutes of this movie are amazing, indeed. Very well captured is the sheer horror of landing on a fortified beach; the disorientation, the killing etc. But after that, this movie drops on the level of ""Armageddon"": a mother has a number of sons, all of them died during the war, except one and the US military surely puts the life of half a dozen soldiers into peril to save that last one. Of course, that is completely logical.The German soldiers, in the contrary, don't seem to have mothers or anyone who cares about them, they are ugly, lean-mean-killing machines, shouting incomprehensible things and should be killed wherever possible. They are also not just as scared as any other simple soldier on a battle field, they don't have any feelings at all.So, what could have been a great movie, with all the money spent for and stars on it, playing in the same league as ""All quiet on the Western Front"" gets to be completely pathetic, unrealistic, super-patriotic and one-sided. Steven Spielberg once said that he often didn't feel he was a ""real"" American and was left-out because of him being Jewish and that the past of his family haunts him. It is ok to feel that way and I wish him he will finally get rid of both feelings. But on the other hand he also was left out of getting an ""Oscar"" until ""Schindler's List."" That was a well done movie, but on the long run it seems it didn't do Spielberg too good. Somewhere he must have come to the conclusion that doing movies about WWII helps him overcome his problems and making them patriotic will help him getting an Oscar.If you are interested in a realistic look on war, watch ""All quiet on the Western Front"" or ""Das Boot."""
vasilievniki,"Jan 19, 2022",10/10,"A large-scale military drama showing all aspects of human existence in the conditions of world chaos without a transparencies.Attention to small details, historically accurate - such as the stunned bodies of fish on the shore, shown during a fast-paced amphibious landing operation on the shore. A frankly shown meat grinder inherent in clashes of troops. Emotions of living beings, of which there are few people left, attacks of religion, every second of hope, which is interrupted by a bullet that pierces through the head of a soldier who has just planned further actions.In between these are glimpses of the human from the conditions of the peaceful existence of the headquarters of the troops, from where the humane order comes, to resolve which is a moral dilemma, the 'trolley problem'.Tom Hanks, ingeniously conveying the emotion of the captain, who is entrusted with this task with a group of people, different in character and constitution, in the revelations of evening dialogues revealed through spoken speeches.Moral dilemmas throughout the film, the solution of which is either according to Bentham, or according to Hegel, which can lead to various consequences, but the essence of a biological being in an extreme situation is simple - 'either I, or Me'.Camera work, editing, sound accompaniment - immersing in the atmosphere, transmission through color shades - plot twists, everything is appropriate and accurate.The motivation and goal setting of many key characters is clearly conveyed.Symbiosis of animal and human - everything is intertwined into a single concept.

Alyssa-the-Critic,"Feb 15, 2018",10/10,"Book-ended so deftly with genuine and heart felt honesty, this film is one of Spielberg's most important. And is definitely, in my view, the most important and impacting War genre film ever put to celluloid. From the gritty, in your face representation of what the Normandy landing was like -to which veterans in theaters often had to clear out for that harrowing opening, such that the depiction struck too real- to trudging into the unknown throughout war-torn France that Hank's character and his band of brothers face; this movie hits a combination of humanity and the brutality of War that everyone should see in their lifetime. Not for the violence of it but to honour the men who laid so costly a sacrifice.A technical feat of filmmaking, as well as respecting the lives and the bravery of young men in battle against a threatening foe (Hitler's Germany), this tributes their legacy in a truly human way. Without cliche, without glorification, nor a hint of faux emotion. John Williams score drives this humanity throughout every scene, especially in the transitions to the next sequence of events. And Spielberg guides these performances with precision to deliver unforgettable, and harrowing moments throughout.Thoroughly deserved Sound Design, Editing, and Director Oscars for Saving Private Ryan! A masterpiece. Enthralling. Engaging. Relentless in bursts, but will give you a handful of breathers and close on a tragic, if not reflective ending that shows the cost of War."
fernandez_1989,"Dec 19, 2006",N/A,"The greatest battle in the twentieth century took place at the shores of Normandy, and it was fought by courageous soldiers who spilled their guts and payed the ultimate sacrifice for freedom.Out there in that beach, Dog Green Sector, Omaha beach, hundreds if not thousands of courageous American soldiers took and kept a vital position for an invasion to liberate the old continent. Their warrior spirit allowed them to gain a bitter victory.Too many young Americans died in that battle for making possible to send other people free. This source of American pride moves me in so many ways. We love the American heroism and we share our admiration for the greatest warriors: the American soldiers.This movie, starring a great American actor, Tom Hanks, in the role of Captain Miller, 2nd Ranger, shows the American attitude and the struggle they went through to achieve one of the greatest American victories in world history. It is not easy to understand the huge victory it was for America and world freedom to win the most important war in history. I will always love America for that.Other fantastic American actors like Vin Diesel and Giovani Ribisi play an awesome performance as heroic kind-hearted soldiers in the face of evil, showing all the heroism we can expect from an Army Ranger.All in all this movie is a must-see and it is worth to buy the DVD. The fantastic soundtrack and the emotional flag-waving at the end of the movie make your eyes to water-up. You will never forget this excellent Hollywood production and the wonderful story told will get you speechless for a while."
alex-306,"Feb 8, 2003",6/10,"Best war movie ever made?  Please.  Go watch Full Metal Jacket, Platoon, Ran, Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, or any other film made by a director with a true understanding of artistry in film-making.  Spielberg's sycophants make me sick.Saving Private Ryan is best when Spielberg sticks to what he is actually good at, to wit, action.  I whole-heartedly admit that the two big battle scenes are breathtaking.  However, two scenes do not a movie make. Everything else was  duller than dull.  No profound insight.  Nothing but cookie cutter characters, cheesy dialogue, and mindless flag waving.  If this film was the only source of knowledge about Americans that someone had, s/he would come away with the conclusion that Americans sure are a bunch of cornballs.  But we can shoot people pretty adeptly, can't we?Spielberg, go back to making ET and Raiders of the Lost Ark and save the heavy stuff for real directors.  That is all.6/10 (the two battle scenes warrant a 6)"
Member,"Nov 29, 1999",1/10,"The more I think about this film and read differing reviews about it the more I feel it wasn't meant for me. I'm a Finn, not American. I don't know if Spielberg meant this film as a last hoorah for the G.I.:s, but to me that is what he made. All right the film does have something to tell for everyone: in the insane theatre of war one should try to do the right thing, have courage to do it, that your actions have consequences, war as a whole creates nothing but bad feelings and probably something else too but nothing that has not been told earlier.And I suppose that isn't so bad, I mean there have certainly been worse films. But what does bother me is that Spielberg set out to do a film about what war is really like and to me, he failed. Yes I have seen the opening scene and to me it was more about exploitation and action film then about anything else and not even very memorable action. Even if one would skip all the omissions and strange things about the film (in the landing scene no naval artillery support, no air force support and the illogical German tactics in the final battlescenes) to me the main plot is a strange curiosity that only serves to illustrate that the average soldier wasn't that interesting or important. Apparently with some links to reality the main plot remains distant and odd to me.With Oscar, block-buster, critically acclaimed material as ww2 with all the gore how could Spielberg go wrong? First of all the acting. Well I could not stop wishing there would have been some lesser known actors used, maybe even amateurs. A lot has been made out of the cinematography and yes, it is good. Although to me it is not so effective when there is apparently too much money to make a film and then the camera work tries to make it look more realistic. As ww2 films go this film is a far cry from ""Come and See"". Yes I do admit that flag waving is a common problem among ww2 movies, I just wished that Spielberg could have avoided it."
MAXIMUS_747,"Jul 5, 2023",9/10,"Amazing movie about a very serius topic! One of the things that makes Saving Private Ryan so special for me is its realism. Spielberg's has a veary special attention to historical details. Tom Hanks delivers as always and brings his characters to life, I think that results in a beautiful connection to the character and you really feel with him. The conection to the caracter and the raw storytelling will probability leave you breathless.The movie showing the reality of war in all its messiness, following young men unsure of their decisions and mostly just full of fear! The movie is really worth watching and I think it is a 9/10!"
jrugg19,"Apr 15, 2021",10/10,"Private Ryan is the best war movie to come around. Hacksaw Ridge, Dunkirk, and 1917 are all quite great, but they are nothing to Private Ryan, which redefined the genre and has made the formula for every modern war film. What amazes me is that Spielberg continues to be a master of technical filmmaking. He makes the impossible seem entirely possible. But he continues to be underrated for the way he can create emotion out of his audience.This movie makes you care so much about so many characters, which frankly many of them don't get all that much screen time; he makes characters such as Private Jackson or Cavarzo stand out with the few minutes they can shine on screen.I truly believe that this movie was certainly robbed of Best Picture at the Oscars, and that Tom Hanks delivering a completely authentic performance was also missed by the Academy.This movie brutally shows the horror of war, and continues to be the landmark of the war genre. It'll be shown in school for years as a firsthand look into what these people go through. It's pretty much a flawless war movie,"

Tom Hanks plays his role extremely well in this movie. Along with other actors in here such as Matt Damon and Vin Diesel. Spielberg really got the costumes down pretty good. As well as the graphic explosions of the tanks. This is an adventure of Capt. Miller and his crew to save this one pvt., Pvt. Ryan. This movie was made on the 60th Anniverrsery of the invasion of Normandy. So this is the movie to see if you need to see a good WW II movie. Another movie that might be enjoyed if you liked this movie is Schindler's List."
ethantumarkin,"Oct 7, 2005",10/10,"I remember when I first went to see this movie. I was 14 and when I was going to turn 17 I was determined to join the army - u know, spend the summer with friends, learn new things, meet new people, and most importantly be a soldier for my country.All that changed in the first 5 minutes of this movie. I have never had a movie impact me so much. To all of you who are so full of yourselves that the only things you can say are: ""So typical of American movies, always making movies about Americans"" or ""Typical Spielberg, displaying the allies as the good guys and portraying the Germans as the bad guys."" You people make me sick. Forget about your prejudice towards America, just watch the movie and understand the message about war that its trying to bring out! And for those of you who can honestly sit there and feel sorry for the portrayal of the Nazis, you are the reason I wanted to join the army in the first place, to put people like you in your place.Anyways, terrific movie, definitely set the new standard for war movies. Still one of my top 5 movies."
briangcb,"Sep 24, 2005",N/A,"Many reviews I have heard about this movie that are negative all say something along the lines that it shows the Americans as heroes, shows the Germans as evil killing monsters, and that it basically is just a big American Propaganda film. Lets be serious here, WW2 has been over for quite a while, we know who won the war, we know who the bad guys were...The Waffen SS and Hitler. So there is no need to have a WW2 propaganda film almost 60 years after the war had ended. The Wermacht soldiers they do battle with in this film are not shown as monsters, they are basically not given any character, just as the enemy that needs to be killed in order to win the battle. Which is exactly what the Germans were to the Allies in WW2. Not to mention the soldier that confronts Upham on the stairwell, if the Germans were portrayed as mindless killers then that Soldier would not have had a second's hesitation to kill Upham. This film shows the war through the eyes of a small group of US soldiers. The Germans are referred to as krauts, and just as the enemy. This is deliberate during wars to show the enemy as objects instead of human beings so it makes it easier for them to kill the enemy.It shows the Americans as heroes...not for winning the war, but for the battles they fight in during the course of the film. Yes it shows the US soldiers taking Omaha Beach in 30 minutes when it obviously took a lot more than that. But this movie is FICTIONAL it is only INSPIRED by real events, nor does it say anywhere in the film ""this movie is based on a true story."" It glorifies the deaths of the main characters, because like i said before it is shown through the eyes of this group of soldiers. Therefore they'd be up close and have their friends dying in their arms, and it would be emotional. Not that it was any different for the German soldiers, but the US soldiers wouldn't know because the Germans were the enemy to them. If they were to make this film from the German's point of view, then any American who hates it, and loves this film is an ignorant hypocrite. So before you chastise Spielberg and the film itself. Just think about that."
glentom1,"Jan 16, 2004",8/10,"Plenty of war drama and blockbuster action to start the movie, then a long boring few hours to end it. Very unrealistic overall. Hardly a great war movie. If we are to view the title of the movie as the plot of the movie, then we have been fooled greatly.If it is really saving Private Ryan, then why no scenes of Private Ryan until the movie is almost over? Well, if there had been, then they couldn't have played that little prank on the viewers of the first Private Ryan saved being the wrong one (Matt Damon).If you are going to watch this movie, have plenty of coffee, because after the first half you will fall asleep quick. This is just another stage for Tom Hanks, a mediocre actor that the studios keep trying to push down our throats (except for Forrest Gump, a role he was well equipped for). I give it 5 of 10 stars, because of a few good scenes."
buttercupywesley,"Apr 24, 2006",10/10,"Read dedjim's comments on this movie. His are the best by far. I'm sad to see that this sight is mainly a place where people come to express their thinly veiled political diatribes in the guise of a movie review.This was a great movie about sacrifice, courage, loss, violence, revenge, folly, and most of all the strength of character it took (and takes) to defeat evil. The young people of that time defeated fascism (and later communism). Their children and grandchildren would not have their character forged in a worldwide depression dovetailed with a worldwide war. This reality explains much about the differences between the generations. Theirs was one of stoicism. The ones that followed were less mature, and generally lacking in accurate historical perspective - I say this as a retort to those who post on here mainly invoking their political bents.This movie is a more accurate ""experience"" of WW2 than most movies made on the subject. My next door neighbor for 15 years was one of the most gentle and humor-filled men I have ever known. He never once mentioned to me that he was a decorated WW2 bomber pilot. But he was. He came from a humble background; was wounded in the war; lost many friends in the war; and met his future wife (Army nurse) during the war. Then he returned from the war and instead of letting his experiences ruin him and the country, he and his compatriots helped rebuild a nation and a world. I came to know him better after his death by talking to his family about the experiences he went thru during the turning point in history known as WW2.This movie is a masterpiece made by one of the masters in Hollywood."
baymiyagi,"Jan 19, 2019",7/10,Watch for first 20 minutes. after that just a casual money spilled storytelling.
Sovrien,"Dec 30, 1998",1/10,"""  SAVING PRIVATE RYAN   ""I thought that this Movie was going to be a masterpiece. Topping those great Anti-War films of ""Apocalypse Now"" ""The Boat"" and ""All quiet on the Western Front""But alas!  What am I to expect from America?  The Truth? NEVER!Yet another great, expensive war film, where the Germans fight like Italians,  TOTALLY arrogant to anyone else.  I mean HONESTLY an American flag at the start and at the end.  Showing the American and French flags.  The ENGLISH and CANADIANS DID land on Normandy too.  The only reference to anyone else is an insulting comment about Monty.The Germans may have suffered a bit more on the eastern front than the Americans in France, but that doesn't matter because they were on the wicked side.This is the kind of film simply made to win another Oscar for Speilbergs already crowded shelf.  Not a ground breacker, not a truthful film. NOT even historically correct!!1.  Radar was a TOTAL secret.  No American privates or captains would have ANY idea of what Radar was.2.  Germans, especially those of the SS, would NEVER be stupid enough to attack a ruined village with Tanks first. It was common military knowledge for both sides.3. The P-51 D mustang, which blows up the Tiger Tanks on the bridge,  were NEVER tank destroyers, they were only used as long range bomber escorts during the invasion.  The only Tank destroyers being employed at that time were BRITISH.  NOT AMERICAN. So of course the Americans would take out this imperfect feature.Frankly, if you're American, you can go get your gun an' feel patriotic once again, as you have done with ""The dirty Dozen"" ""Where Eagles Dare"".If you're not American, avoid this, and stick to ""The Boat"" for your WWII viewing."
MrPupkin,"Oct 25, 2019",9/10,By far the most captivating war time movie to date. With a great cast that really help put into perspective the effect war has on everyone and the amount of losses that could happen at any moment. It shows Spielberg at his prime and all the effort everyone put into the movie to make it as realistic and atmospheric as it is.
DreamEnchantre,"Nov 13, 2001",10/10,"I absolutly love this movie. Sure its a little gory, but it's a very well played war movie. It mixes a little humour in with a very dramatic and tragic story. It really captivates me every time I watch it. I's recommend this to anyone who likes a good story and can handle some blood."
tfrizzell,"Jun 24, 2000",N/A,"Steven Spielberg's ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the those films that is a pure cinematic masterpiece.  It's gritty, realistic, and well-made in every possible department.  The film captured five Oscars and probably should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998.  Some things about the film that really stick out are the cinematography (where approximately 60% of the color was faded from each frame), the editing, and of course Spielberg's direction. I'm not sure any other director working today could have done as well as Spielberg did on this picture.  Tom Hanks is also excellent.  He is one of those rare actors who can dominate a film without dominating it (in other words he's always there, but he makes the supporting actors better).  In many ways this may have been his best acting job ever.  All in all ""Saving Private Ryan"" is easily one of the top 10 or 15 films of the 1990s.  It's a film that will be remembered for decades to come.  5 stars out of 5."
sarahguotx,"Feb 8, 2022",8/10,"To be honest, it's Tom Hanks that attracted me in the first place to check it out, but the story was absolutely powerful, touches deep inside. Amid all the killings in the backdrop of war (way too much) and lives lost in the process of saving Ryan...something about humanity shines through and elevate your inner being, but the loss of lives still make you a bit sad in the end."
TrusTinsanity,"Feb 2, 2025",9/10,"I watched this film a few months ago, and I still remember what an amazing movie this is, although not all that much of the plot. 'Saving Private Ryan' shows the brutality of war and also has an incredible story outside of just that.About the violence, for me it wasn't all so bad, except for the opening scene where all of those soldiers where losing their limbs, that was depressing. The ending, which I won't spoil, is bittersweet and really well done.Tom Hanks is also great in this film, he's a great actor in general. Oh, and yes, my favourite Steven Spielberg movie is 'Schindler's List'10/10."
djetm,"Jun 15, 2021",9/10,"Maybe the most perfect war movie that I have seen.Tom Hanks, marvellous as always.But what really made this movie for me, was the acting of Tom Sizemore.(I know the others too - was incredible)He reminds me of this friend of mine, that would do anything for you,
and still have a smile - and just carry on.Everyone should see this movie."
fihatanim,"Dec 15, 2024",9/10,"I still feel out of sorts whenever i rewatch the movie. The movie is a poignant reminder of the sheer horror that the soldiers face in the combats. The director went all guns blazing with the movie and damn it delivered. The action scenes, the drama everything was top notch and the director hit it out of the park with the brilliant execution.It was a tough movie to pull off but he really had the conviction which prompted so. I saw that movie when i was a teenager and i vividly remember the impact it had on me. I cried and wept through most of the time. It was upsetting, yet enjoyable. Finally the movie left me dejected."
crossfire-7,"Dec 6, 2006",7/10,"I wish I could view this movie like the average moviegoer. In that case, I would probably have given it higher marks. However, I was in the Army and know that dialogue such as is in this film would be highly unlikely, no, impossible, to have been said in real life.The hierarchy in the service is very clear: privates do not contradict, interrupt, defy, or in any way address their superiors as is depicted in this film. I found a number of scenes to be pure Spielberg fantasy. The scene in which Hanks doesn't provide the full name of the 'Ryan' he is searching for, which results in Hanks delivering the wrong information to the wrong 'Ryan', is hard to swallow. The scene with Matt Damon protesting when told he is being taken off the front lines is also hard to believe.The scene where Oppem (or whatever his name was) protests against shooting the POW is absurd. No way that would have ever happened. Some of the other unlikely aspects of the film: Tom Sizemore throws his .45 caliber pistol at the German; four soldiers pull the pins on their grenades and drop them in the tank turret, yet none of them detonate. The scene at the end when Tom Hanks starts firing at the tank with his .45. In real life, he would have been dead by then after being shot in the back with what amounts to a high powered rifle.The scenes after the Germans bring their 20 mm. cannon into action also didn't get very far past the GI's first encounter with the fearsome weapon. After it annihilates about six or seven GIs from one short volley, one wonders why the Germans didn't make quick work of the rest of the GIs after that.The dialogue was also a bit too pristine for my tastes. In reality, GIs curse up a storm. These guys were a wee bit too polite and wholesome. Platoon gave a much more accurate account of how GIs actually behave.These criticisms aside, the action scenes are well staged and evoke a healthy pulse pounding for the viewer."
AvidClimber,"Jun 6, 2013",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan is the best Second World War movie ever made.The good. Almost everything could be listed here as exceptional, but I'll just mention what really makes this a master piece. First and foremost, the fighting and how it's depicted. You feel the same stress, terror, and confusion as the soldiers. There are some heroics, but it's normal man heroics. Men die by the score, there's no favorites. It's dirty, it's loud, it's dangerous, it's inhumane. Beyond that, you've got an incredibly compelling story, amazing photography, a rich scenario, very attaching and real characters, as well as interesting thoughtful dialogs.The actors. There are so many excellent ones, and a number that were on the cusp of their stardom. Tom Hanks is of course in one of his best incarnation ever. Tom Sizemore is the perfect solid loyal sergent. Paul Giamatti has a small role, but without contest one of his best by playing his normal edgy style in a war context with a thin veneer of authority and calm. Edward Burns is just right as the loud mouth New Yorker. And you cheer Barry Pepper as the God blessed sniper. Now for a few surprises. Giovanni Ribisi, playing a bit far from his usual role, is excellent as the overwhelmed caring medic. Dennis Farina, which I normally do not like, is a stoic senior officer with an calm aura. You can also see a young Nathan Fillion in a quick cameo. Here, one might argue whether Matt Damon was given a large role or not, but he did carry it out well, if a bit subpar for him. However, the truly big surprise is the appearance of Vin Diesel playing something completely out of his usual affectations with credible results.The bad. It's a near perfect film, but there's one thing that irked me. The family of the veteran was either badly chosen of badly directed. When he starts to cry they all act as if it was a big surprise. Really? What did you think he was going to do?The ugly. Nothing.The result. Be ready for some tough bloody scenes, and you'll love this realistic representation of war."
Julius_Lang,"Dec 31, 2024",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan is the most vivid film watching experience I have ever witnessed. I have never been quite so impacted by a film.First and foremost, every actor from Vin Diesel to Matt Damon gives it their all in this film. I truly felt as if the soldiers were human and their experiences were literally being documented.Secondly, it is genuinely in the top 3 most well edited films I have ever watched. The gritty, dark, and especially gruesome bookended action sequences are very likely to leave a mark on you.Thirdly, it pays tribute to the courageous soldiers who fought during the war. Some may say that this is an
'anti-war' film. In my humble opinion, it is more of a film that dedicates itself to honoring those who fought on
D-Day and everything after.10/10 but I'd give it 12."
rivercat-497-81711,"Jan 23, 2022",10/10,"My Grandfather fought in WW2. This movie is close to what he went through. He had nightmares his whole life of what he endured, but he loved his country!"
zippybottom-66395,"Mar 10, 2022",8/10,Tom Hanks - what can I say. You can't go wrong with this actor. The film is a touch watch. Particularly at the beginning. Not for the faint hearted. It highlights the ugliness of war and finds beauty in the camaraderie of the allied soldiers. There's moments of light in the dark.
zaremskya-23761,"Apr 18, 2018",10/10,"This, in a long list of big films, is probably Spielberg's greatest accomplishment. It has so much heart, humanity, and raw drama that it will most likely be in the top tier of films for all time. It's just spectacular in every way. It throws you into the biggest armed conflict of our time while deftly and carefully drawing you into a very intimate story that puts many aspects of the war into perspective.Reviewing a war film is difficult for someone who has never been in one. I don't think any serious critic would pretend to know what it's like to be in such a horrifying event. I think the best you can do is speculate, and even then, you risk treading on some serious ground by giving such films a review.That being said, the film looks, feels, sounds, and moves perfectly from start to finish. Technically, it's a masterpiece. The lesser-known stars give as good of a performance as the big-name actors, which is a sign of terrific directing. The personal story-line weaves effortlessly within the big drama of the war, and the whole thing is written beautifully.As I'm writing this, I can think of no flaws. Some people give Spielberg a hard time for being overly sentimental, but I just don't see it in SPR. The emotions all seem appropriate for the environment. The action is riveting and often brutal. Characters fall off the radar quickly. The war is overwhelming. It all makes sense in context.The best films are like statues; solid, powerful, and eternal. This one will stand for a long time. Even if some of Spielberg's films get taken down a notch for sentimentality and overblown spectacle-making, this one won't, and never will."
TheRedRex,"Mar 9, 2022",10/10,"Throughout the history of cinema there have been numerous all time great war films, but try as they might, there is still no war film quite like Steven Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan.The film treats the subject of war with the respect, dignity, and realism that it deserves while also telling a throughly riveting story. Everything that you have heard about the World War 2 battle scenes in this film is true. Each one is stunning, harrowing to behold, and remarkably well shot. The brutal realism and horror of these scenes cannot be understated. These are the kinds of battles that will chill you to the bone, leave you speechless, and make you pray that you NEVER find yourself on the battlefield. This is mainly due to the incredibly immersive sound design and cinematography of the film which always makes you feel as if you are right there with the soldiers as they are being dismembered, burned alive, and shamelessly slaughtered. The battle sequences are infamous for featuring no music, only the constant, monstrous sounds of shell explosions, machine gunfire, and blood curdling screams. Spielberg also frequently made expert use of first person shaky cam shots during the battles in order to put the audience right in the middle of the chaos and destruction.However, despite all the brutality, it would mean nothing without an effective story and likeable characters. But, the film shines brightly in this department too. Most of the soldiers that the film focuses on are three dimensional and feel like real people. Moreover they are all given solid acting performances by their respective actors. In particular, Tom Hanks and Matt Damon's performances as Captain Miller and the titular Private Ryan are obvious standouts. Hanks is well known for delivering all time great performances in practically every film that he stars in and this film is no exception. Hanks comes across as strong willed, likeable, and experienced in the role. The young Damon also delivers a realistic and down to earth performance as Ryan. Both characters are well written and flawed, with Miller in particular experiencing substantial growth throughout the movie through a great character arc.The film's screenplay and plot are some of the best in the history of the war film genre. The physical and moral struggles that soliders must endure during war are conveyed exceptionally well in this film. Characters often make morally ambiguous decisions that blur the lines between right and wrong. In fact, it is debatable whether the mere premise of the story is right or wrong. The film also explores the effect that war has on each individual solider, as well as whether it is acceptable to be a good sumaritan on the battlefield . These are very mature and thought provoking themes that go far deeper than most war movies (especially the ones made before this film) dare to go.Overall, Saving Private Ryan has earned it's status as one of, if not the greatest war film of all time, and one of the very best films of Steven Spielberg's all time great filmography."
Chris-169,"Aug 2, 1998",N/A,"In reading through the comments made on this page, I realize that people had several interpretations and opinions of what this movie was supposed to be (as people often do).  However, here's how I feel the movie was intended, and why I say that this is by far the greatest war movie, and one of the greatest movies of any genre. The prevailing comments among nay-sayers is that the characters were too stereo-typical, and that a plot of one man being important enough to risk the lives of 8 was unbelievable. That's exactly what Spielberg wanted. First, the characters.  They were _intended_ to be stereotypical.  How could you represent every man that ever fought in this, and other, wars without being stereotypical?  Unless, of course you wanted to have a cast of several million people.  The point was to show the trevails that every man went through in the war, NOT to give a unique face to each. And it seems he did this with his usual mastery.Second, the plot.  The mistake that most are making is that they're thinking of Private Ryan as one man.  He wasn't.  He was everyone.  Every person that was sitting in that theater.  Every person that has ever been a part of this country.   When he tells Ryan to ""Earn this"", he is talking to YOU. He is saying that we're not here today by accident.  It took normal men (a school-teacher, for instance) to make sure that we could someday go on IMDB after seeing a movie and spout our opinions. He is telling you not to waste the precious life you've been given. So, yes, this is perhaps the greatest movie of all time, shaky camera or not.  And they fought so that I could sit here on my soapbox and give my opinion. Thank God."
moonspinner55,"Oct 22, 2006",6/10,"Director Steven Spielberg's usual homey touch (which infiltrated even ""Schlinder's List"" in its final act) is thankfully in slight evidence here, as WWII soldiers attempt to locate one particular man whose siblings have all been killed in combat. The set-up for the plot is a bit formulaic (and layered with Spielberg's need for romanticism), but the very fine performances and exhaustingly exact scenes of violence remain haunting and memorable. Vivid cinematography and frenetic editing won Oscars, as did Spielberg (who deserved it). I was rather surprised by how powerful this movie is, given the feel-good reputations by many of the principals involved. I'm not a lover of this particular movie genre, but the film pulls no punches in detailing many unrelenting scenes of battle. *** from ****"
noiseball,"Jun 4, 1999",1/10,"It may not be the MOST overrated, but it's certainly up there along with Scream and Fargo and There's Something About Mary.Oh what a battle scene - the fantastic motion sickness inducing cinematography, the masterfully overhyper editing, the gore, oh the wonderful gore.  And so forth.The Omaha beach landing was quite intense.  It was brutal and affecting. But people just can't seem to get it into their heads that one extended battle scene does not a great film make.After *that*, we get yet another version of a tired, clichéd mission movie, filled with your usual stereotypes: reminiscing about the good ol' days before this all ever happened, doing whatever it takes just to get home, blah, blah, blah. Also painfully stereotypical are the characters: we have the saddened captain who misses his normal job and life, we've got the hardnut sergeant, the Italian guy, the Jewish guy, the New Yorker, and so forth.  And all the Germans are skinheaded bastards - and by the way, where the hell were the other allied troops?  Oh, I forgot, it was the Americans that won the war (flag shots at the beginning and end are just painfully sad).The middle of the MOVIE is incredibly boring.  Pointless, predictable set-pieces are tiresome.  The scenes in which the rattled soldiers tell little stories of life at home (the medic talking about his mother, Ryan talking about his brothers, etc.) are awful attempts at evoking sympathy and sentimentality.Then there's the final battle.  Outnumbered, the men revert to primitive tactics (a bit like Predator).  Quite unbelievably, this lengthy fight is incredibly boring, and the one at the end of Young Guns is far better.5 Oscars?  Obviously due to the beach landing bit, they are mostly undeserved.  Best Director - should have been Peter Weir, or Terence Malick. Best Cinematography - John Toll for The Thin Red Line, without any doubt in the world.  Editing - Out Of Sight deserved this even more than The Thin Red Line.  I suppose the two sound awards are justified.For people to call this the Greatest War Film Of All Time is just wrong. The best is Apocalypse Now.  This is not the best World War Two film either - Das Boot is.  This can't even be described as the best D-Day/Normandy beach landings movie either - The Longest Day kicks its a**.   To go even further - this is not even Spielberg's best war film.  Schindler's List is superior.To summarise - great beginning, but the rest sucked.  If you haven't seen it, don't bother.  Or, if you insist, watch the beginning, then leave/press stop.  You'll be doing yourself a big favour."

marifevisitacion-99018,"Aug 1, 2024",10/10,"My grandfather fought in WW2 somehow surviving D-Day. He was apart of Operation Neptune and stormed the beaches of Normandy. He told us a lot of war stories but rarely ever spoke about that day. Before he passed away he did an interview with a local newspaper and detailed what he saw despite it being very difficult for him to speak about. He loved watching war movies... not sure exactly why. Some about that soldier life never really leaves them I guess. He absolutely hated Pearl Harbor cause of the horrible way they portray the military to be a bunch of toothbrush wielding babies who don't know what to do in the event of being attacked. He had a friend stationed there who lost his life and thinks that movie is a disgusting display of ignorance. Soldiers don't take girlfriends on private plane rides. And they most definitely know how to swim. Maybe I'll give that movie a good ripping one day.But Saving Private Ryan was a respectable ""I can't watch this"" reaction. He said no movie has come that close to capturing what that day was like. He said it was too realistic. Whether or not the story is based on real or fiction, that intro was 100% realistic. I'm not sure if he ever did finish watching it but he appreciated it for capturing that chaos like no other movie has before. I watched the movie a dozen times now and keep it in my collection as a reminder of my grandfather. A scene he was technically in. Which makes me appreciate how strong of a person he really is."

Lots of bullets, blood, and heads blowing apart does not mean it qualifies as real.  It can't be real.  We've seen all of these characters in a hundred other movies.  Tough, tobacco chewing sergeant.  Cynical, mouthy private. Even the sniper getting shot through the scope.  Spielberg is ripping of a schlock tom berringer joint.

rikbloom-115-127800,"May 26, 2018",8/10,"The 1998 movie ""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of the all-time great war movies. While much of the movie is a fictional account, the premise behind Capt. Miller's mission is based on a true story. That is the story of the Niland brothers - Edward, Preston, Robert, and Frederick - from Tonawanda, New York.The two middle brothers, Preston and Robert, had enlisted prior to the beginning of the War. After America entered the war the oldest, Edward, and youngest, Frederick, known as Fritz to his friends, joined up in November 1942. Because of the tragedy of the Sullivan brothers aboard the USS Juneau earlier that year, the brothers were split up and sent to different units around the Army. Edward became an enlisted pilot, with the rank of Technical Sergeant, of a B-25 Mitchell bomber flying in the Burma-India-China theatre. Preston was commissioned into the infantry and assigned to Company C, 22nd Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. Robert and Fritz both became paratroopers. Robert served with Company D, 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division. Fritz joined Company H, 501st Parachute Infantry Regiment of the 101st Airborne Division. U.S. Army paratroopers are dropped near Grave, Netherlands while livestock graze near gliders that landed earlier. This was the beginning of Operation Market Garden during World War II, which resulted in heavy Allied losses. As fate would have it, three of the brothers found themselves preparing for the invasion of mainland Europe.However, before the brothers could start their ""Great Crusade"" to liberate Europe, Edward was shot down somewhere over Burma. He was listed as Missing in Action, but this usually carried a presumption of death at the time, especially if he had fallen into the hands of the Japanese. Then, in the early morning hours of June 6, 1944, Robert and Fritz joined over 23,000 Allied paratroopers in cracking Fortress Europe. Although Fritz's unit, 3rd Battalion, 501st PIR, was supposed to be the division reserve, the misdrops meant they were thrust into action in ad hoc groups. These forces were able to secure vital causeways, bridges, and locks allowing the 4th Infantry Division, and Niland brother Preston, to exit Utah beach later that day. U.S. Soldiers of the 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division, move out over the seawall on Utah Beach after coming ashore. Other troops are resting behind the concrete wall. Elsewhere, Robert Niland had landed outside of Ste. Mere-Eglise with the rest of the 505th as part of Mission Boston. After the 3rd Battalion was able to capture the town early in the morning, the 2ndBattalion linked up with it to establish a defensive perimeter. When a strong German counter-attack came from the south, Robert Niland and the rest of D Company's 3rd platoon were left to guard the northern approaches to the town in a small village called Neuville. When two companies of Germans came at their position, they fought tenaciously to hold them off to buy time for their comrades to the south. When the position became untenable, Robert Niland, along with two other paratroopers, volunteered to stay behind and cover the platoon's retreat toward Ste. Mere-Eglise.While manning a machine gun in the face of the German onslaught, Robert Niland was killed in action. That very same morning, Lt. Preston Niland led his men onto the shores of Utah beach as part of the seaborne invasion of Normandy. Though casualties were relatively light for the men of the 4th Infantry Division on Utah beach, the battles beyond would be much tougher. Despite having made if off the beaches, the men of the 4th Infantry Division still had numerous gun batteries of Hitler's Atlantic Wall to clear. The task of capturing the Crisbecq battery, which had already sunk the destroyer USS Corry, fell to Lt. Niland and his men. On June 7, Niland led his men against the German position. During the heavy fighting Niland fell mortally wounded. The rest of his unit was repulsed. The battery would not fall until several days later to units of the 9th Infantry Division. The Niland brothers' parents received all three notifications in a very short amount of time. Their only condolence was a letter from Fritz informing them that ""Dad's Spanish-American War stories are going to have to take a backseat when I get home. ""Fritz was unaware of the fate of his brothers. When the War Department received word of the tragedy orders were dispatched to return Fritz Niland to the United States. That task fell to the regimental Chaplin, Father Francis Sampson. Sampson located Fritz, who had been searching for his brother in the 82nd and began to paperwork to send him home. Returning to the United States in 1944, Fritz served for the remainder of the war as an MP in New York.This article was written by James Elphick and originally appeared on WeAreTheMighty.com"
antileft,"Apr 18, 2008",10/10,"Even thinking about this film gives me the chills , well,like practically everything Mr. Spielberg has done in his career , lifting the American movie into the cinematic heaven . Hopefully , many movies are still ahead of him , the greatest artist ever, no doubt !There is nothing new to say about Saving Private Ryan , after so many years , except that perhaps it ought to become the must study subject for anyone interested in military history or history as such , because ,friend,it cannot go any gorier than this , that is, any more realistic than this ( watch Rambo 4 , When Trumpets Fade , Windtalkers ). Saving P.R. has somehow created a new genre of films , that is ultra-realistic war movie that transcends anything solely written, in fact , as has always been the case with Mr. Spielberg, literature gets its visual manifestation, where even Shakespeare would pipe down and bow in reverence ! Even 10 is not enough , simply no numerical quality, unit , exists to describe the sheer power of this cinematic experience , not even the designation 'film 'itself can do this ! Angelic, stratospheric , out of this dimension , Mona Lisa in cinema !"
rustybq99,"Dec 19, 2001",10/10,"I have to agree, this is really good historical fiction, one note however... there were guys on the beach that had what looked like a Yen-yang on their shoulder and on the back of the helmet, which would be the 29th Infantry Division (a National Guard Unit), instead of either a diamond with a #2 (2nd Rangers, which we saw) or a #5 (which we didn't see).  As far as I can find, only the 2nd and 5th Rangers were in the first wave of the assault, led by then LTC James Earl Rudder, and thus there should have been no 29th Inf, at least not in the first wave.  A couple of really good books on the subject is ""Rudder's Rangers : The True Story of the 2nd Ranger Battalion D-Day Combat Action"" and ""The Liberation of Pointe Du Hoc : The 2nd Rangers at Normandy, June 6-8, 1944""  One thing that would probably suprise most people is that LTC Rudder came onshore with his men, and that his was one of the first transports to hit the beach, and that he lived through it.  Of course, he was a Texas Aggie, that alone could be why his forces were able to succeed.  Read the books, you'll never watch SPR the same way again."
Vassy,"Sep 6, 2005",10/10,"This was one of the first war movies that i've seen, and it has to be one of the best. Steven Spielberg has directed what has to be a masterpiece. The movie is accurate,although there are petty details that could have made this film better than it already is. From the beginning of the film, Spielberg gives us a sense of the dramatic landings on Omaha beach, a view of the whole allied advance on Normandy, once the Axis trenches and bunkers have been taken. The way Spielberg captivates each character within one another, and yet be different from one another is superb. I think Steve Spielberg has captivated the idea of brotherhood and comradeship, which in turn has what i think led him to the making of the HBO mini-series, Band of Brothers. The cinematography has to be credited, and the background music is fitting for such a film, thats why i gave it 10."
Medabloga,"Apr 26, 2005",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan will probably be remembered as a true classic, the best war movie ever made that presented World War II as good as possible... For those who haven't seen the movie - Run, Run and don't look back, go rent it, and enjoy every minute of it.The movie begins with the well known American invasion to Europe in operation Overlord at the problematic Omaha Beach. Never in filming industry had there been a better war scene, so true, so real, making you actually feel like you are a soldier taking part in the invasion... Spielberg didn't censor what the war was probably really like by showing less blood, less dead and less wounded. In fact, this scene, showing zero regards to Human life isn't just to make the viewers feel excited, its true purpose will be understood only later, after watching the film...Following the invasion, Cpt Miller (Tom Hanks) gets another mission - ""straight from the top"" - Rescuing a private parachuted deep in enemy territory after 3 of his brothers lost their lives in the war. Eight men, rescuing one.After the bloodsheded scene in Omaha, this mission looks rather stupid, one life? is it really worth endangering the lives of eight? Omaha beach showed how hundreds die like little defenseless mosquitoes... How is one life that important? Without a doubt, Spielberg didn't randomly choose a mission to base a movie about. This movie isn't just an action film... It has an hidden message, It shows that on the side of war, with so much dead, zero regards for human life we are all still human- those who die at war aren't just soldiers, they're men, with lives, desires, needs - they have names, brothers, sisters - and each and every one of them counts... Omaha is war, it presented it quiet good but the rest of the movie - well, thats humanity... Suddenly, one life does count, and endangering the lives of eight looks rather right.Don't get me wrong, the movie is all action. true hardcore action... The rest of the movie, following the invasion, escorts the small squad led by Cpt. Miller as they search for one soldier, Private James Ryan, in occupied France... Endless battle-scenes, action, suspense - actual war...I will stop here without spoiling any part of the film - This movie cant be described in words... Abseloutly amazing... best movie i have ever seen - A MUST SEE! although i doubt any true movie-fan would skip watching this movie..."
evanston_dad,"Jun 21, 2010",6/10,"Count me among the group of dissenters that thinks ""Saving Private Ryan"" is 20 minutes of technically expert film-making capped by 140 minutes of monotonous war film punctuated by treacly and typical Spielbergian emotional histrionics.Spielberg's attempts at meticulously recreating the Omaha Beach invasion that take up the first half hour or so of this film are stunning. But the film grinds to a halt after that with a lame story and shallow characters that go nowhere. Spielberg wants us all to feel guilty (doesn't he always) about what soldiers in WWII went through, but his way to do that is to throw brutal violence in our faces every few minutes. The thing is, it's not the violence that makes other and better war films bring home the horrors of war to its audience; it's the depiction of what war does to a man's psyche. It's another film from 1998 set during WWII combat, Terence Malick's ""The Thin Red Line,"" that stands as the year's masterpiece about war. But audiences ignored that film because Malick wasn't willing to hold their hands and tell them how they should feel, something Spielberg could teach a class in.Grade: B"
ronakkotian,"Jun 24, 2021",10/10,"Watching this for the first time was an experience like no other. There have been countless war films that have followed this film yet none of them were able to make me feel the way Saving Private Ryan did.Saving Private Ryan takes us on a journey with eight US soldiers, led by Captain Miller, as they go behind enemy lines to find and bring home a solider whose brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg has made some of my favourite films of all time but I consider Saving Private Ryan to be one of his best directorial efforts. The opening 30 minutes alone is among my favourites. Every single aspect of the Omaha Beach sequence is sheer brilliance. I'm not someone that's fond of handheld cam but Spielberg used in a way that transported me into this battle like no other film. I truly felt like I was there in the moment, trying to fight off the Germans whilst fearing for my life as my comrades died beside me. I cannot imagine how incredible and emotional this sequence must have been in a cinema. Spielberg really didn't hold back on the violence either. The blood and gore add to the brutality and harsh nature of war. It's absolutely crazy to think of the lengths soldiers would go to and sacrifices they would make for their country and the film's graphic nature depicts their bravery and struggle perfectly.The film is nearly 3 hours long but Spielberg keeps it engaging and riveting through its runtime. There is not a single dull moment at any point. Even when there isn't any action taking place, we get so much character development that takes us deep into the minds of their soldiers. Scenes of them sitting down and bonding with one another brings us closer to these people allowing the emotional impact to be even stronger. The visuals are incredible in every way. From the grey and dark green colour palette to the destroyed landscapes, each and every part of the production design and technicals is beautifully done.What also adds to the emotional core of the film are the wonderful performances by the cast. Knowing how great of an actor Tom Hanks is, he always manages to surprise me. His portrayal of Cpt. John Miller is amongst his best work. Matt Damon and Vin Diesel are also terrific in their roles. Tom Sizemore, Barry Pepper, Edward Burns, Adam Goldberg, Jeremy Davies and Giovanni Ribisi are all spectacular in their roles as soldiers and put forth very natural performances.Saving Private Ryan may possibly be the best war film ever made. It's gruesome and honest depiction of war pays a great tribute to all the soldiers that fought in the war. Steven Spielberg has outdone himself here as well as the actors and the entire crew."
steph-baker2110,"May 5, 2015",10/10,"AMAZING MOVIE EVER!!The first time that I watched this movie was in school and I knew that I HAD to get it for myself! I love the way they had the affects of guns and grenades. I can't wait for my son to be old enough to sit and watch it with me :) I don't think any other movie about war would even come close to Saving Private Ryan. Tom Hanks and Matt Damon were a good pair, and would be good to pair up again! I recommend this movie to A LOT of my friends. They come back and tell me that it was remarkable, then they tell other people to watch it. I wish that I could shake Spielberg's hand to say Thank You for making an AWESOME movie and that I'm going to wear out my disc very soon."
kgprophet,"Jun 3, 2019",9/10,"I just recently had a chance to re-watch this film in a cinemaplex. Not exactly Imax, but it was a larger screen than my home TV, and theatre audio was superb. I saw this film when it originally came out in theaters in 1998. The opening sequence gained notoriety for it's unflinching visceral photography and shockingly graphic violence. I have watched this film a few times since then, but seeing it on a larger screen, I had an appreciation for the realism that Spielberg insisted on. If it was virtually any other filmmaker, the expense of realistic production with extra attention to detail would not have happened. Instead we would have been presented something not as noteworthy.These efforts were the reason it won several Academy Awards. There is so much depth to the story. The film zips along with small set pieces that provide some kind of insight to the enigma of war. Not only are there some classic performances, there are classic faces. Bryan Cranston, Vin Diesel, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Tom Sizemore, Adam Goldberg, Giovanni Ribisi, Dennis Farina, Barry Pepper. Very recognizable faces.Tom Hanks, now less of an A list star compared to the 90s, gives a very natural performance. He shouts commands as a confident captain taking part in the most incredible feat attempted by our country. We get to witness these events, partially through the gun-shy eyes of Corp. Upham, played by a meek looking Jeremy Davis. He reacts as most of the audience would to the cacophonous noise and chaos. He flinches as much as anyone would with bombs going off right next to you. He also represents the humane approach to the war, which of course goes against reason at times.There are accolades to go around, including a detailed script. Capt. Miller's unknown career back in the states. Searching through a pile of dogtags. A glider landing that went FUBAR. A genuinely funny anecdote about the Ryan brothers before the war. Coherent explanation of strategies and improvised weapons. When confronted with a dilemma, the script smartly explores it to find a piece of wisdom that the audience can learn from. So we get a history lesson about the first few days of the D-Day invasion, while being entertained with believable and memorable characters.The cinematography can be considered a landmark in visceral storytelling. The use of high shutter speeds removes the normal blur when there is an explosion. In this case, the explosion particles are vividly in focus, and feel all the more real and lethal. I lost track when watching the more technical aspects of the film of how many shots were done in a single take. In the final battle, there is a shot following Upham from cowering from an explosion, tracking him to another building on another block, with a tank and soldiers approaching, returning back to the previous street, and ending with a conversation with Sgt Horvath (Sizemore). There are many more long shots like this throughout the film that go unnoticed. The shots are staged so well they feel like a documentary, with no deliberate use of shaky cam needed.Lastly, the density of the soundtrack must be noted. There is a never ending barrage of gunfire, explosions, objects flying in the air, footsteps, weapons being loaded, and on. The immersion of the sound (again with the advantage of hearing it on a well tuned sound system in a theatre) makes the experience even more intense. Such as the quiet rumble of German tanks approaching. The spare music score gives the perfect backing when the moment requires it.The 2 hour and 49 minute running time goes quickly, with each set piece as part of the journey providing something new and intriguing as the squad of soldiers encounter the war. The longer script gives character depth, and glances at small details that might have been otherwise excised for time.I give this film a 9 out of 10, and is not only one of Spielberg's all time best films, but a timeless work on it's own. How would I rate it as one of the best war films? I would put it up there with perhaps ""Patton"", but I believe, that every well made film about war can each provide a unique insight into war. Such as ""Apocalypse Now"" is one the best war films in the way it shows the perversity of war."
discoelephant64,"Feb 26, 2005",10/10,"Breathtaking. Spectacular. Incredible. Whatever words used to describe this film do no justice to what Spielberg so masterfully created. This movie is the only movie to have left me in awe, in shock, in sadness. On all levels this film was perfect. I do not know how historically accurate it may have been, but I know one thing. This is one of the most memorable films ever made, and it should be recognized as the best war movie to date. I am a proud Canadian citizen, but this film gave me a greater respect for what the Americans were trying to do in Europe. I used to protest the fact that they joined the war late, however this film has shown me that they suffered as great a loss as all the countries involved in that war.The film truly was an epic, an epic that will leave me to think for some time."
johnmschofield,"Oct 15, 2009",10/10,"I was born 9 years after WW2 finished and my father was a fireman in the midlands area of England during the war. I do not know anybody who was directly involved in any fighting so therefore the only way somebody like me can be educated in what has taken place during any war is with documentaries, books or a realistic portrayal of events in a war film. I have read numerous reputable books and watched award winning documentaries about WW2 and viewed a long list of films featuring various parts of the war but nothing I had heard about this film prepared me for the opening sequence. I doubt there is anyone on this planet who would not be affected in one way or another by it. You can get a dictionary out and list the adjectives but those 22 minutes are infinitely more descriptive than centuries of books, unrealistic films and fancy speeches. The whole film is close on three hours and is and hopefully always will be an education for anybody watching. For me this film should be regarded like a monument to all the people who have gone to war irrespective of when or where it took place or why it started in the first place. I suspect that the real thing was worse than what is shown in the film but what is shown is graphic enough. We have been killing each other for centuries but this like a select few other films lays it all out realistically. I personally thank the director and the entire cast and crew for the result of all their hard work. For anybody out there who has not seen this film please watch it and if possible stop reading this stuff I have written and lob the DVD into the machine and make your own mind up."
ciscokid1970,"Sep 27, 2006",10/10,"This is one of my favorite films of all time. I can watch it over and over again. It also has one of my favorite actors of all time, Tom Hanks. This movie should have been Tom Hanks 5th Oscar but for some reason the 'academy' has some bias against him.Many people have said that the start of this movie is the most intense, realistic capture of the invasion of Normandy beach. In addition the shooting of the first part of the movie puts you inside the action along with stunning 5 channel sound that places bullets, bombs and screams all around you.Does not stop there there is plenty of action in this movie. It shows many sides of humanity during the war and you even see the impact of all sides US forces, German forces and by standing citizens.This movie to me was the best film of 1998. Unfortunately 1998 was one of the most competitive Oscar runs in history. Titanic, Shakespeare in love, Elizabeth and Life is beautiful all competed that year. And as always the Lovey-dovey movies mostly win the Oscar races.Still this movie was so great that it spawned a HBO miniseries that was equally great ""Band of Brothers"".This is my favorite movie from Spielberg."
Angsw8,"Aug 18, 2005",10/10,"This movie is the greatest war movie ever! Tom Hanks was a perfect captain and Matt Damon was such a great Private Ryan. The beach scene was such a great scene, although it was pretty intense the way that Steven Speilburg directed that scene was truly fantastic. Another scene that was truly touching was when they had to tell the mother that her three sons were dead and they didn't know where her forth son was. It made me feel like crying and I'm sure that all the other fans out there felt the same way.The ending is very dramatic, but Steven didn't go overboard. When the old James Ryan almost starts to cry I felt the same way. When Tom Hanks died that was the ultimate surprise or scene in the movie. It was awesomely brilliant, but very sad. That's my basic overview and opinion on ""Saving Private Ryan."" -Ashley"
OriginalMovieBuff21,"Apr 27, 2004",10/10,War is Hell! This movie rocked. The opening scene of the movie was the best on the Omaha Beach. The action kicked ass and the battles of the entire film was phenomenal but not only that the plot was as great as can be. About Capt. John Miller and seven soldiers looking for just one other soldier who all of his brothers were killed and return him back home. The movie was also deeply sad and I kept feeling sorry for the soldiers and I always felt that I wanted to just go into the movie and fight for U.S. This is the best war movie of all time and it will remain the same unless some other comes up and overpass it but for now this is a masterpiece!!!10/10!!!Highly Recommend
tedg,"Nov 16, 2008",N/A,"Every once in a while, I go back to watch films that were celebrated in their time. These have to be films I saw when they were newly nested in their warm buzz, and which were conveyed as if they were a privilege. This is such a film, one that can perhaps serve even as the exemplar.It was touted as (at last) a serious film by Spielberg, chapter two of his ""real"" film which marketed the holocaust. It had Hanks, who it should be recalled was more uniquely respected then than now. It dealt with a sort of real history with direct pulls on patriotism and something called valor, in a way that would make Sinatra and Wayne blush (or at least hiccup).And its first 20 minutes was chocked full of effects that worked and conveyed a meaning of confused dread. It moved us all  how could it not?  and allowed the filmmaker to lazily move through an ordinary story, staged as if it had a different production crew.Seeing this again in my own context and with the objectiveness of distance, I am amazed at how effective that opening section is, and how typically bad Steven the rest is. That first part is tense, tight and close. It is horrible without forcing us so close that we recoil.You know, one of the biggest challenges in film-making is to introduce the audience to the world they will live in for perhaps a few hours  the film and the long tail of recalled experience afterward. Usually the filmmaker has only a few minutes. Some  especially when a strict genre film is coming  can even do it during the title sequence. We are prepared for this entry voyage; it is part of the contract we make when allowing a filmmaker to transport us. I cannot recall a film that took this much time to prepare us. Perhaps ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" but that setup was disjointed.So I have to admire Spielberg's craft in putting together a session that has impact, though it is all tone and no narrative. And I have to admire his ability to understand and exploit that twilight area where we are primed for such a thing. And then 20 minutes in, we start to ask why, why engage us? Why open us to be ready for something that matters and serve us bread?Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
texd,"Oct 4, 1999",6/10,"Overall, this is a well made film that is not well written.  Sure the opening scenes (Normandy) are dramatic and touch you deeply, but as soon as the allies secure the beach, the movie begins to fail.Surely there is a better script for a film about WWII in the European theater that would have served as a good vehicle for the dramatic first half-hour in this movie."
stew0203,"Mar 20, 2001",1/10,"This is one of the single worst films I have ever seen.  Spielberg was, once again, intoxicated by his own sense of patriotic splendour. The first major flaw in this film struck me the first time I saw it.  I was in the theater and began to ask myself, ""How could Ryan remember the D-Day invasion when in fact he was never there?""Now, honestly, how did Spielberg expect to get away with that one? It was never explained or followed up in any way. Secondly, how did he expect to get away with portraying the Germans as mindless, blood-thirsty grunts?  ""Well they were, weren't they?"" says the blindly patriotic american.  This aspect of the film is a disgrace to Germans and more importantly to the brain-washed americans. Finally, I would just like to point out the fact that this was not a war to rescue individual men in order to preserve their family line. This film makes a mockery of WWII by completely misrepresenting it.  The only aspect that was accurately portrayed was the violence, which sadly enough drew many people to the film. Two thumbs down!"
tmacfan19,"Feb 11, 2007",10/10,"I first watched this movie when I was a young'un. It had an impact on me, more than I could have imagined. At that time (I was still a kid then) I wanted to join the Army, because I assumed that I could simply pull out a machine-gun and blast everyone to oblivion. This movie made me see the light. Now that I'm older, and can understand films better, I can fully appreciate the beauty of this film. It's gritty without being gruesome, it's brutally honest without overwhelming you, it's funny while it focuses on the drama; it's just plain brilliant. It deserved every Oscar it got, and more in my opinion. The cinematography alone is to die for.All in all, 11/10."
imseeg,"Sep 28, 2018",10/10,"Steven Spielberg's masterpiece. Tom Hanks most magnificent performance. Winner of 5 Oscars and more than 70 other prizes worldwide. Unprecedented true to life combat photography. Dynamic 3 hour long story that elevates this movie into the best tribute to all those American soldiers who died fighting for freedom in Europe during World War II. This is THE ultimate depiction of D-Day when the Americans freed western Europe. What a tragic and bleak, yet glorious epic war classic!The story is literally about the rescuing behind enemy lines of an American soldier called Ryan, played by Matt Damon in a small supporting role. Tom Hanks has to rescue the guy with a team of specially selected soldiers, among which are Giovanni Ribisi and Vin Diesel. Their journey to find and rescue private Ryan is a long, bleak and bloody one, in which soldiers are normal people with nervous breakdowns who go mental when confronted with so much cruel violence. This is not a gung ho funny action movie, this is how it really could have happened, with all the bleak and twisted soul shattering fears that soldiers have to conquer mentally, when they are in combat.The photography is stunning. Like I have never seen it before. Seen this movie many times now and it bewilders me every time how they have achieved such a level of true to life war combat photography. Even if you might not like the story, which I would find hard to believe, the action photography on itself is worthy of an Oscar, which it deservedly got.The soundtrack is dark and glorious. The sound effects were sonically blasting my ears when the tanks started rolling and the mortar shells were exploding all around. Editing is done with a fever pitch that keeps me glued to the screen. I can go on and on about the superb technical skills with which this movie was made, but the most important thing is that this movie has a got a pulsating righteous heart at it's core. This movie touches me profoundly. Only a few times during the last 40 years, have I ever been this fascinated by a war movie. Incredibly impressive!"
wes-connors,"Jul 13, 2009",10/10,"""Seen through the eyes of a squad of American soldiers, the story begins with World War II's historic D-Day invasion, then moves beyond the beach as the men embark on a dangerous special mission. Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks) must take his men behind enemy lines to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), whose three brothers have been killed in combat. Faced with impossible odds, the men question their orders. Why are eight men risking their lives to save just one? Surrounded by the brutal realities of war, each man searches for his own answer - and the strength to triumph over an uncertain future with honor, decency and courage,"" according to the film's official synopsis.Once again, the Steven Spielberg and his crew of filmmakers climb to the top of the mountain, and deliver a terrific motion picture. This time, it's a heart-tugging pro-war (significantly, pro-World War II) epic of astonishing power. Initially, ""Saving Private Ryan"" impresses with its violent depiction of the Allies' D-Day landing, on the shores of German-occupied France. With waves of blood, Mr. Spielberg shows the human cost of defeating Fascism - by what TV anchorman Tom Brokaw called ""The Greatest Generation""; although, honestly, every generation has its greatest, this is a fitting term.Captain Hanks and his squad - Edward Burns (as Reiben), Jeremy Davies (as Upham), Vin Diesel (as Caparzo), Adam Goldberg (as Mellish), Barry Pepper (as Jackson), Giovanni Ribisi (as Wade), and Tom Sizemore (as Horvath) - are among the few to survive the invasion; and, are ordered to save Mr. Damon's ""Ryan"" (for the reasons given above). During quieter times, the personalities of the men emerge, with Spielberg and writer Robert Rodat creatively painting human portraits. The silhouette of the ""war mother"" dropping to her stoop as the military vehicle approaches is one of the film's most simple, and effective, portraits; it supports the film's prime directive.Hanks and the men are a more complicated literary group of characters than they seem. Spielberg is obviously manipulating the story through them; and, their strongly-directed, natural performances help make it work. The film's main message is delivered by schoolteacher Hanks' ""Miller"" in his final words to student Damon's ""Ryan""; listen for them. And, don't miss the secondary message, told by Mr. Davies' multilingual ""Upham"" character; especially, watch how he pleads with Hanks to set a German hostage free, and note the consequences of their action.It's tough to rank performances in an ""ensemble acting"" film (they're all stellar), but, for literary greatness, you've got to add Mr. Ribisi's doctor ""Wade"" to most memorable list. He tells an incredibly introspective story about how he pretended to be sleeping when his mother would peak into his room; note, eventually, Ribisi goes home to ""Mama"". Also interesting is how Mr. Sizemore's ""Horvath"" serves as the ""voice"" of Spielberg/Rodat, exalting and purifying Hanks' character. He says both the film's title and tag-line (""Except this time, the mission is a man"").Spielberg's use of ""flashback"" is one of the best you'll ever see; and, he definitively defines the term ""gut-wrenching decision.""********** Saving Private Ryan (7/24/98) Steven Spielberg ~ Tom Hanks, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Giovanni Ribisi"
LoneWolfAndCub,"Apr 18, 2006",9/10,"The first 20 minutes of this film is a brutal glimpse into the violence and complete uselessness of war. We see people getting gunned down, limbs getting blown off, people blown in half, guts everywhere, it is not a pretty sight. It's this, and many other things, that make this one of the greatest war films I've ever seen.Captain John H. Miller (Tom Hanks) and his men are sent on a mission to recover Private James Ryan (Matt Damon). Along the way many hardships are faced and overcome between these men.That is pretty much the plot, but the movie is more than plot. It is a journey through World War II's harshness and a journey with these men. We come to care for these men. They aren't given huge amounts of development, but they don't need it. The actors really make us care for these people, as does Steven Spielberg's skillful directing. This is definitely one of his best movies.It is also a lot different. If any of his movies contain violence, there is very little of it. This, however, contains some of the most graphic violence I've ever seen. It truly shows the violence, dirtyness and uselessness of war. It doesn't offer anything but pain and misery. John William's score also creates a very suitable mood.The only reasons I have for deducting the half a star is because of the very start and the very end. The American flag flapping in the distance was a little too sentimental for me and I found it unnecessary.4½/5."
wishbone-2,"Nov 7, 2000",N/A,"This was a decent movie but still was highly overrated by everybody. The Plot was some what weak, and although i like Tom Hanks I believe he is overrated in Hollywood's eyes and thought that all of his movies get over hyped. I think the same thing With Green Mile which was a decent movie but still overrated and Forrest Gump, I personally thought Billy Bob Thorton made a better movie in Sling Blade. However Hanks did make good scores in Big and Apollo 13. I also think Spielberg is overrated. How can people say that this is better than Apocalpsye Now and Platoon the 2 greatest war movies of all time. The Thin Red Line was better than Saving Private Ryan by a hair they were both overrated. Platoon is the best war movie ever!"
dorotka24,"Nov 20, 2007",10/10,"There are few movies in history that can deeply affect us and leave an undeniable emotional impression. This film is one such. I can remember exiting the theater on weak knees, not from sitting for so long, but from the emotional turmoil it caused.Certainly an average Joe like myself who has never served in the military nor ever faced combat cannot truly fathom the horror of war. But since a number of WWII combat veterans who viewed the film were impressed by its realism, I can safely say that my feelings in leaving the theater were more than justified.It's easy to criticize a war movie for being limited in scope, as Ryan was, but in my opinion it makes for a much more visceral, intense, and satisfying movie experience. Some films, like ""Patton,"" ""The Longest Day,"" ""Midway,"" and a number of others have tried to better represent the monumental undertaking that was WWII. While I commend such efforts, the focus therein is too broad - one cannot appreciate the individual sacrifice and emotion involved, and it's easy to get lost in the numerous characters and distracted by the overall scope of the film.Ryan focused not only on one theater of the war, but in one geographically small area. Additionally, it is seen through the eyes of a small squad of American soldiers. I would not have wanted it any other way.Spielberg has outdone himself here, spotlighting his artistic range and re-affirming why he is one of the greatest of American film directors. Be warned - this is likely among the most intense war films of all time, and is not for the weak of stomach or heart.But unlike many of the sanitized war movies of the past, this one gives us a taste, however small, of what must have been a truly terrifying and devastating experience."
eddie_baggins,"Nov 10, 2015",10/10,"It'd be implausible to think that anyone who wasn't involved in World War 2 could ever understand the true horrors or hardship the men and women of the time went through in that terrible time. Over the years we've had countless documentaries, novels, movies, games and TV series that have looked to offer an insight into what it felt like to be a part of the World War that claimed millions upon millions of lives, and arguably the most visceral and heart pounding take of them all is Steven Spielberg's incredible Saving Private Ryan.A film unlike anything Spielberg had made before or has made since, Ryan, with it's as close to real opening stanza on the beaches of Normandy and journey culminating in a speaker shattering finale in the crumbled ruins of the city of Ramelle, is a downright masterstroke of movie making craft that to this day near 20 years on from its initial release has lost none of its impressive and heartfelt power.Spielberg accomplished his impressive feat by surrounding himself with the cream of the crop of film-making wizards. Employing the services of now famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski who single-handedly reinvented the way in which war films and action in particular was shot, the keen eye of long standing editor Michael Kahn, the screen writing abilities of The Patriot scribe Robert Rodat and of course the musical accompaniment of a John Williams score, Ryan had at its disposal the A-team of Hollywood and it shows.All around Saving Private Ryan is quality, pure unbridled grace and confidence that fills the film's every frame and it extends to its eclectic cast of established and at-the-time up and comers which was led by the almost never better Tom Hanks. After Hanks' leading man Captain Miller we have Ed Burns's cocky Reiban, Barry Pepper's religiously inclined sharpshooter Jackson, the late Tom Sizemore's gruff Horvath, Adam Goldberg's wisecracking Mellish and Jeremy Davis's jittery language expert Upham. It's a great team and when you throw in Giovanni Ribisi, Vin Diesel and of course cinemas most rescued, Matt Damon with added bit parts by a one armed Walter White in the form of Bryan Cranston, a slim lined Paul Giamatti, a non-CSI Ted Danson and even a baby faced Nathan Fillion, Ryan acts as a who's who of recognizable actors that each for a small period or large period made sure the film was one of the most well-acted of the modern era.Filled with heart, stunningly filmed sequences of confronting warfare and a cast of memorable personnel, Saving Private Ryan is one of a handful of quintessential war films that have managed to somehow in various states capture what it may have been like to be among the countless wars that have raged over our planet in years gone by.A deserving Oscar winner that in many ways can be seen as a faultless exercise in big budget film-making and the perfect example of a men on a mission movie done well, Saving Private Ryan is one of, if not the greatest film in Steven Spielberg's outstanding and loaded filmography.5 greased up socks out of 5"
Seller7861,"Jul 30, 2007",10/10,"You both are dim bulbs to say the least. The film is a fictional story and purports to be just that, why people keep holding it to a documentary standard is beyond me. But it's stupid to do that and displays the limited intellect of those like twistedfieldofvision who do just that.Carmad, you are not a writer. And nobody who works in your ward on the psych wing believes your ""I am Shakespeare"" proclamations. I'm sure your equally impotent teen pal who thinks he is Napoleon and occupies the bunk above yours believes you, but consider the source on that one.This film is brilliant and is one of the top 3 movies S.S. ever made. The speech where the General reads Lincoln's letter is touching and very appropriate. WW2 was the moral equivalent of the war to free the slaves. Tom Brokaw labels the fighting allied men of WW2 the GREATEST GENERATION. He is correct. And their humility regarding what they did for mankind's future is part of the reason that label is accurate."
AlphaBravoCheesecake,"Jun 22, 2022",10/10,This is a film that must be seen in the cinema. As a child i watched it when i was 15 and it was one of the most scary experiences i had up to that point.The SFX and the rumbling of the tanks back when i was a kid scared the hell out of me and that experience has never happened since watching it at home. I would go so far as to say it is a different experience all together and when it does periodically come on in the cinema you should rush at a chance to see it.
markkp,"Sep 30, 2002",6/10,"The subversive postmodernism couldn't be more obvious, no almost no one notices, so corrupted are we by the malaise of pacificist impotence. The whole concept of basing a film against the very flow of D-Day--the ""heroes"" are not there to win anything, they're there only to drag someone out. While thousands of Americans, Brits, Aussies, Canadians, Free French and others are dying fighting Hitler's army and Luftwaffe, Spielberg is leading a campaign of mighty forces to pull a lone American out of the combat zone no matter what the cost. To use the world's greatest invasion from the sea as the mere backdrop to a story is, to me, perverse, and trivializes the extraordinary efforts both of the men who fought during the Normandy invasions and the earlier generation of filmmakers who sought to portray that effort on a grand, much nobler canvas."
johnm_001,"Jan 31, 2001",1/10,"So many people loved this film, that I actually rented the DVD to re-watch it. I had originally seen it in a movie theater, during its initial release, and I hated it. The second time was certainly not a charm. Possessing the knowledge of what was to come, made for an even more boring movie experience. This film's much talked about opening, lends nothing to the paltry narrative that is the rest of the film. The movie meanders about, aimlessly, for what seems an eternity, and almost nothing happens. When something does happen, it isn't anything that you haven't seen, done by the same old characters that you've seen before, in countless other (and better) WWII films. Even the dialog is old Hollywood corny. Then, after being about virtually nothing for hours, it ends with a hokey gimmick of the realization of who the old Vet is. Meant to tug at our heartstrings (nothing wrong with that); but only elicited a groan and a roll of the eyes from me. Tedious, with virtually no character development. Not Recommended."

Sylviastel,"Apr 23, 2006",10/10,"I first saw this film in the movie theater. The beginning of the Normandy landing has not left my mind. It is one of the most spectacular introduction to the film. You have a cast that includes Spielberg's favorite actor, Tom Hanks, Matt Damon, Paul Giamati, one of my personal favorites-Rolf Saxon in a non-speaking role. This film is mostly a male-dominated film with little or no romance. SPielberg's best asset is creating a spectacular image and this time, the landing on Normandy was not for the easily sickened. You will see the graphic display of the horror on that day which is what we should see. HE does not shy away from showing us human brutality at its worst but he later shows it at it's best. I didn't care much for the title about them rescuing one soldier to bring home. I wanted Steven Spielberg to know that this is his best film to date about World War II even surpassing Schindler's List which I felt was inferior to this film. The script was superb, the movie is just a breathtaking spectacle to date. It still should be seen in the movie theaters to show the effects and brutality and to remind us about how cruel war is on any level. he won the Oscar for best director but after seeing Shakespeare in Love, there is no doubt in my mind that Saving Private Ryan was robbed of Best Film. Sorry, Shakespeare in Love!"
Davi-Jones,"Aug 13, 2006",10/10,To begin I have to admit that this is one of the best war movies ever made. No doubt Tom Hanks is splendid and he shows a real devoted patriot soldier who cares for his family as much as his mother country. The war scenes are excellent. One can hardly believe that it is a movie because the way they have pictured the film is more like a documentary. The bloodshed at the beginning of the film and the cemetery yard with all the white crosses takes you up to the heaven. It is too rare that one watches this movie and doesn't get shocked. Shocked to see so many innocent boys killed at war and all this in vain because The US has begun other wars in Asia and other sites. So FOR THE SAKE OF ALL THOSE PATRIOT BOYS AND ALL CAPTIAN MILLERS DO NOT RAGE ANOTHER WAR TO KILL AMERICA'S SONS

moviesleuth2,"Apr 9, 2006",10/10,"During the opening sequence when I saw the man's face and I was preparing myself for a long flashback, a growing sense of dread overcame me. Yet still I was not prepared for the horror that I was exposed to for the next 2 1/2 hours. Horror is the only way to describe this film. I wasn't simply watching the film. I was absorbed into it. Steven Spielberg is arguably the most famous film director out there, and for good reason too. He can make a film like no one else. Everything here works so well, the acting, the action sequences, the atmosphere and emotion. It's all here, and highly energized. This, along with Schindler's List, one of the greatest films in cinematic history. is Spielberg's masterpiece. One of the main reasons this film works is his cinematographer Janusz Kiminski. The grit of the camera sets up the atmosphere perfectly, and the lighting is superb because even when it's a sunny day, it's still covered in darkness. People have criticized this film for having a bad storyline. That's not true, not at all. While the storyline is simple and nothing new, it's because that's what it would have been like in real life. Life is not a intricately woven storyline like say The Silence of the Lambs, and the people with this film know that. The key to making this film work is making it real. And that it does."

Sure, for all americans it's great. Risking many people to save one in order to not let one mother loose ALL her children. But the other 8-12 americans who die? What about their parents, wifes, girlfriends and children?Please! It's has realistic battle and death scenes. That's all."
fenway_faithful_2004,"Mar 2, 2006",10/10,"Overall this movie was well made. I am not going to sit here and act like I know what happened over there, because I don't. This movie shows what the war was like through the eyes of the soldiers who fought in it. It is a vivid and graphic portrayal of war during World War 2. The movie is intense, but is important to watch. The cast does a great job. They put this feeling on you that is hard to describe. In my opinion this is one Spielberg's best films. He does a great job of showing the intensity of battle between men, the struggle for survival. He also does a great job of adding some comic relief to make the film seem a little lighter. This is one of my favorite movies because of the action, plot, and acting. At the end of this film you might feel sad, but not disturbed. This film made me feel very patriotic and proud of the country I live in. It also makes me appreciate all the men who went through so much in order to maintain world peace. If you have a strong stomach and are a big fan of war movies, I highly recommend this masterpiece."
Fahrenheitz,"Jan 2, 2004",6/10,"The first 20 minutes of Saving Private Ryan is probably the most realistic depiction of war and the invasion of Normandy ever made. That being said, the plot is far fetched and the story drags out for while without anything really happening. There is very little character development and many of the characters you never really get to know all that very well.The last combat scene of the movie does not live up to the first. It was very disappointing to me personally. In reality the German military was highly trained and professional. In this movie they are reduced to cannon fodder in the last 25 min. It seems to me there was two different directors on this movie - one for the first half and one for the second half."
the_bike,"Mar 9, 2004",1/10,"Spielberg set out to make a realistic depiction of the Omaha Beach landings to kick off  his film, which is about a fictional mission of a squad to rescue one Pvt Ryan, of the airborne, dropped inland behind the beaches. One glaring idiocy of the film is why they would dispatch soldiers from the Omaha sector to rescue someone droppedbehind the Utah sector, especially when 4th Infantry Div soldiers arealready in contact with a large portion of the airborne troops. The answer is, of course, because that gives Spielberg his opportunity to display the Omaha landings rather than the Utah beach landings next door, which were too easy and lacked any bloody combat. If the only thing anyone knows about the V Corps landings at Omaha came from this film, then they would have been better off skipping the film, or at least the opening scenes of battle. Read a book and learn what happened at Omaha. You'll find that it wasn't anywhere near as bloody as Spielberg's film leads one to believe. Omaha Beach was considered bloody only because of comparison with landings at the other 4 beaches, which were virtually walkovers. The rest of the movie is not much to see, with many errors in the combat sequences, especially with respect to tactics that would have been used. Spielberg's film is badly flawed as history, and the story is downright unbelievable - why not radio the 101st  and order Ryan off the line? Why send a few guys to walk thru the entire German 7th Army and search in a 400 square mile area for some guy named Ryan? The US Army wasn't always the most efficient, but they would never have sent off a squad on such a cockamamie mision."
woody-175,"Feb 5, 2006",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan has to be one of the greatest films of all time and is personally my favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg has captured war as it really is. All detail is considered to make this movie one of the most, if not the most accurate war film ever created. The actors performances are brilliant especially that of Tom Hanks. This movie really focuses on each of the characters and the mind of a soldier in which many other war movies fail to capture. After watching this film I have now gained a greater knowledge of what war really consists of and therefore gained a greater respect for those veterans who served during D-Day especially and in general WWII. I would very much recommend it to anyone.One of Spielbergs best."
robert_the_bruce1,"Oct 9, 2005",10/10,"To say Saving Private Ryan is a great war movie would be an understatement. This movie deserves a place in the top 50.This movie would have been nothing without the amazing directing of Steven Spielberg and I'm glad the academy honored him. This movie is incredibly violent, but it is to show us what the soldiers of WW2 had to endure. Without that, it would not have been as powerful.John Williams also delivers a very good musical score throughout the film I especially enjoyed the cinema verite technique utilized by Spielberg to give us the feel that we're on the battlefield with the other soldiers.And, of course, there is Tom Hanks. One of his best performances. He is undeniably one of the best actors of all time. I'm glad that he and Spielberg teamed up for this. It wouldn't have been the same without either of them."
c-stickney1,"Nov 1, 2005",10/10,"I first watched this film in the cinema when it first came out, and how to describe it then... WOW! I was not the suitable age though, being only 13 at the time and as imagined my impression of the film got better the older i got. Too many people brand their favourite film as 'the greatest film of all time' but if you have seen this film, you will agree with this common statement. However, 'Saving Private Ryan' deserves more than a common statement. The action in the film is intense and the detail has clearly spared no expense. The storyline runs really well with the film and what a cast to play in it. This is Tom Hanks at his best! Not to mention exceptional performances from Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns. Matt Damon did well, however I felt he did not suit the part. Steven Spielburg should be credited for being the greatest film director; not from 'Schindler's List', but from 'Saving Private Ryan'."
HabibieHakim123,"Jul 18, 2021",10/10,"There is no war movie so powerful, so special, so amazing, so impactful, so long but incredible, than 2 hours and 50 minutes of Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan, it's not like watching a movie, it's like watching a real war with an amazing camera work that always follow the soldier wherever they go, we are like one of them but we can't do anything besides watching them in pain and die, Spielberg's did it again, making another Masterpiece."
view_and_review,"Nov 22, 2020",9/10,"There is a distinct difference I always notice with war movies compared to action movies. In war movies, no matter how many rounds are fired or how many explosions occur, every single bullet and every single explosion seems significant. In your typical Hollywood action movie I almost wholly ignore bullets and explosions because they are usually of no consequence. However, in war movies every bullet holds my attention as does every explosion. ""Saving Private Ryan"" cast a particularly strong spell on me where I was totally drawn in.""Saving Private Ryan"" grabbed a hold of me so tight I could barely breathe. From the very beginning it had a death grip on me; just letting up a tad in the middle and resuming its bear hug until the final scene."
zkonedog,"Mar 4, 2017",9/10,"It is quite rare that a movie comes along that has the ability to connect to its audiences on such a human level. For even the most ""advanced"" film fanatics, the movie-watching experience is usually tethered to the moment: You watch the movie, either like it or don't, and then it slowly fades away as life intercedes. In the case of ""Saving Private Ryan"", though, Steven Spielberg changed an entire's nations attitudes and actions towards a single historical event (WW2).For a basic plot summary, this film drops viewers (quite literally) into D-Day, with a prolonged battle scene that depicts the assault on Normandy. After the company led by Captain Miller (Tom Hanks) comes out on the other side, they are given a special mission from ""upper management"": A mother back in the U.S. has just been informed that three of her sons were killed in action. A fourth, Private James Ryan (Matt Damon) is still active in the fight. Miller's goal? Get Ryan out of the war and back to his mother. Is all this effort worth it for one man? Will anyone make it out of the war alive? Those are the questions that Ryan and his men grapple with on the road to find Ryan.When ""Saving Private Ryan"" premiered in the summer of 1998, many veterans were so moved by the opening D-Day sequence that they had to leave the theater and compose themselves. It was that much of an emotional experience for them, yet Spielberg treats it with such respect that it never seems like ""emotional sabotage"" or anything like that. It was just the first time that audiences had ever been treated to such a graphic, true-to-form visage of battle. No disrespect to any of the war flicks that preceded it, but ""Ryan"" didn't pull any punches.Like I said, this is a movie that changed perceptions. After viewing this visceral film, many children and grand-children of WW2 vets began asking their parents/grandparents about the war experience. While an uncomfortable topic, to be sure, it was a dialogue that needed to be opened in order to better understand the members of the ""Greatest Generation"". For so many years, WW2 vets had lived ""in silence"", so to speak, about their war experiences, only relating to their war companions (as they were the only people who could relate). What Spielberg did, though, was bring the topic to the forefront of conscious, allowing WW2 vets an avenue for relating their experiences to the current culture.If I were to start a list of the most important movies ever made from a cultural standpoint, ""Saving Private Ryan"" would perhaps top that list. Not only does it have great action/plot/characters from a film-making standpoint, but it is an experience that can stick with a person forever and change lives."
lee_eisenberg,"May 19, 2006",7/10,"I would have given ""Saving Private Ryan"" a higher score had it looked at more issues abundant during WWII (they could have focused on the various roles that each country specifically played in the war). But don't get me wrong: watching the movie, you can literally feel the bullets hitting you. Tom Hanks commands as strong a performance as we can expect him to, and the rest of the cast also does quite well.I guess that if the movie has any problems, it's in the characters themselves. Aside from the fact that the movie pretty much makes all Americans out to be good and all Germans out to be bad, the Americans are basically clichés. They're all wholesome, hard-working guys out to make something of themselves. Moreover, there's the wise-guy New Yorker and the cowpoke Southerner, and Pvt. Ryan comes from Iowa (read: America's heartland).But otherwise, it's a very good movie, and it goes to show what an incredible director Steven Spielberg is (although I still wouldn't have given the movie Best Picture; I would have given that to ""Life is Beautiful""). Also starring Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Barry Pepper, Adam Goldberg, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Jeremy Davies, Matt Damon, Ted Danson, Paul Giamatti and Dennis Farina."
gigaclaw,"Mar 5, 2005",3/10,"First of all I have to say i like the special effects of this movie, that's why it gets 3 out of 10. What does this film show us ? Steven Spielbergs ""Masterpiece"" of a war-movie ""shows"" us how history can be changed just to show German peoples as backstabbing, chicken-hearted and dumb. OK, the war has been lost, GOOD, I'm glad Germany lost that war. But the film does not display the truth. We all know Americans are the best soldiers, best humans, everyday when they wake up thinking about how to save the planet this time because they are the best peoples on this planet. So you see that soldier running to the bunker because he is an American, always ready to risk his own life for Worldpeace. If its the bad Russians, Japanese or Germans, we need to save this planet from them. I have one question. Who will save us from these intolerably Americans ?"
deathmybeloved,"May 20, 2010",10/10,"Growing up, I knew that my family had a lot of history in the United States Marine Corps and the U.S. Army. My grandfather and his brother were soldiers in the Pacific, and my grandmother's brothers were Marines alongside them. My grandfather would often be asked about what happened over there, and he always just bowed his head, swallowed hard, and told half truths and ""beside-the-point"" stories to appease whoever asked- never truly telling any of us what he and his fellow Americans were- heroes.I had often wondered myself why my grandfather wouldn't talk about WWII, but one day in my U.S. History class in high school I got my answer. This film opened my eyes to the horrors of war. I sat in shock as the gore exploded in front of me, wondering how soldiers and Marines like those in my family lived- or whats more, were able to cope with the events that made them heroes.My point with all of this is that in this day and age, we as a society are so accustomed to violence that we don't really realize what fighting men go through in times of war. We see ""10 soldiers killed in Iraq"" on the news, but it doesn't really register to us as civilians. This was Spielburg's goal in making this film. He wanted to show all of us what fighting men go through for us- you and me. Every American Citizen should see this film to truly understand what it takes to keep us safe.As far as the film itself goes, it is absolutely amazing. No film is perfect, but the actors are incredibly convincing in their roles. The emotion is there, the battle recreations are realistic and as they were in life, and the cinematography is outstanding. It's very obvious that everyone involved with this film was dedicated to making it a tribute to the veterans and it is without any shadow of a doubt, the best war movie ever made.One thing to note is that this is NOT a film for your kids or a film to watch casually. It is intense and should be treated as such.10/10"

bmw1493,"Jun 24, 2025",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan delivers on both the biggest and smallest scales. From the chaos of storming Omaha Beach to the desperate final stand at the bridge, Spielberg captures the intensity and horror of war better than anyone ever has. The opening scene alone is one of the most brutal depictions of combat ever put on screen. But even in the middle of these massive, overwhelming sequences, the film never loses sight of the individual lives caught in the middle of it all.At its core, this isn't just a war movie. It's a story about the people who were thrown into something bigger than themselves. Sons, teachers, brothers, friends, all trying to hold on to their humanity in the middle of hell. The squad sent to find Private Ryan feels like real people, not just war movie characters.Tom Hanks is perfect as Captain Miller, a man trying to stay composed while slowly unraveling inside. The rest of the cast including Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Giovanni Ribisi, Barry Pepper, Jeremy Davies, and a young Matt Damon, feels fully formed and grounded. Even short scenes with minor characters leave an impact.Saving Private Ryan is one of the most powerful war films ever made.

""Saving Private Ryan"" is a cinematic masterpiece that will leave you breathless, tearful, and utterly transformed. Directed by Steven Spielberg and starring Tom Hanks, this 1998 film is a powerful tribute to the bravery and sacrifice of the men who fought in World War II.From the opening scenes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" drops you into the midst of the D-Day landings, where the intensity and chaos of war are palpable. The film's cinematography is breathtaking, with handheld cameras and muted colors creating a sense of realism that's both immersive and unsettling.As the story unfolds, we follow a team of soldiers, led by Captain John Miller (Tom Hanks), as they embark on a perilous mission to find and rescue Private James Francis Ryan (Matt Damon), the last surviving brother of four servicemen from the same family. Along the way, they face treacherous terrain, enemy fire, and their own personal demons.The cast of ""Saving Private Ryan"" delivers performances that are both nuanced and powerful. Tom Hanks is, as always, outstanding, bringing a sense of gravitas and compassion to his portrayal of Captain Miller. The supporting cast, including Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, and Barry Pepper, deliver memorable performances that add depth and complexity to the story.One of the most striking aspects of ""Saving Private Ryan"" is its unflinching portrayal of war."
albertval-69560,"Dec 25, 2021",9/10,"I watched this film the first time when it was released in 1998. I was 44 years old (2 years older than Tom Hanks) at that time. I watched it again recently. In both instances, the thrill that I experienced watching it didn't diminish a bit. It's truly a classic and perhaps the best war
movie ever made.Film technology has advanced so much since 1998. But as a movie buff with little technical knowhow on filmmaking, the movie's technical qualities didn't seem to age. It still looks good on the screen now despite the passage of time.The 2 action sequences, on the beach in Normandy and in the town defending a bridge, are a couple of the best extended sequences I've ever watched. Yet, it's not just the raw action or the realism that has earned plaudits from film critics. It's the quiet drama that unfolds as the Ranger company goes on its way looking for Pvt. James Ryan. (Matt Damon was only 28 when this film was released back then.) Those whispered simple words of Capt. John Miller to shell-shocked Ryan are immortal: earn this...earn it.War is really FUBAR. This should be enough deterrent to start another world war."

When he reports, he is directed to a different kind of assignment -- to find Private James Ryan (Matt Damon), a young recruit from rural Iowa whose three brothers have just been killed in combat within the past week. The objective is to get him out of combat and sent home.The movie follows Captain Miller and a small portion of his squad as they try to find Ryan, who is part of the 101st Airborne, and whose location is not really known. The squad faces various challenges in their search, and two men are killed in the process.Finally, they locate Ryan, part of a small group trying to defend a small village bridge against attack by a much larger German force. Ryan refuses to leave. Captain Miller and his men stay and help defend the bridge. A severe battle ensues in which Miller and most of his men are killed, but Ryan survives. The closing scene shows Ryan 50 years later in Normandy's war cemetery visiting Miller's grave and wondering if his life has warranted Miller's sacrifice.The film was mostly highly praised and received all kinds of Academy Award nominations. It was especially praised for the reality of its battle scenes, which are actually quite difficult to watch. I cringed many times during these lengthy scenes. Purists quibbled about both the Americans' and Germans' tactical mistakes in the climactic battle scenes near the end. Some also complained the movie made it seem that only Americans were part of the D-Day landings.One academic critic said the film degenerated into a harmless, uncritical patriotic performance apparently designed to thrill 12-year-old boys during the summer bad-film season.I mostly agree with that critic. Yes, we see some bad behavior by American soldiers, but by and large, they come through stoutly at the end, including the young translator who cowered during most of the last battle. ""Saving Private Ryan"" does not glorify war, but it does glorify American exceptionalism on the world stage."
SHADO-5,"Mar 9, 1999",1/10,"Lame, revisionist crap. What the hell kind of squad does no recon, talks out loud, and stays bunched together? Also, many of the weapons (esp. the German M 60)are improperly, and fantastically used. How can you use a sniper scope out of the box, with no sighting in? Idiotic. Spielbergs enthusiastic portrayal of the murder of German prisoners is disturbing in the extreme."
svader,"Jan 24, 2021",9/10,"Good cast, acting and storyline.All has been said by other reviews.10x better than Dunkirk."
masonsaul,"Nov 5, 2021",10/10,"Saving Private Ryan is the definitive WW2 movie, a phenomenal war movie that has epic and harrowing spectacle whilst also showing some extremely emotional and human moments in between. Definitely one of Steven Spielberg's best.Tom Hanks gives a phenomenal lead performance with an extremely impressive supporting cast of characters and recognisable actors who all give really impressive performances, especially Matt Damon and Barry Pepper.Steven Spielberg's direction is incredible, action sequences are extremely intense and mobile but always clean and comprehensible. It's perfectly paced, consistently engaging no matter what's happening and the music by John Williams is reliably amazing."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"Feb 1, 2008",9/10,"Many of us can't truly say we know what World War II looked like, but I would venture to say that Steven Spielberg gives us a pretty good idea with ""Saving Private Ryan."" Spielberg, in his second attempt to capture the WWII era on the big screen, has made a movie that plays out like the telling of a war story and in the combat scenes latching back on to a sense of harsh reality with violence and the death of many soldiers.Worthy of the most praise is the incredibly well-deserved second Oscar win for the team of Spielberg and Janusz Kaminski. The two have done everything together and this is certainly a high point of their partnership. The cinematography really captures a war that is both dark and in the case of D-Day, legendary. Rarely do most films capture a spirit of war that is scary and also beautiful without glorifying the war or its soldiers.Here is wear ""Ryan"" succeeds as a truly strong war film and probably the best depiction of World War II battle in history. The characters are strong and while they seem to be more like characters when they don't fight, they react like people when they are forced to do their jobs, not like super soldiers with the exception of Barry Pepper's character, but that only makes the film better by rounding out the way different soldiers viewed the war.The themes are incredibly strong thanks to this depiction of violence. The universal idea of fighting for something or obeying orders when you don't understand why is perfectly interpolated by the band of soldiers sent to find Private Ryan and in that way it requires every viewer to forcibly reconcile that which a soldier in any war must do. Those of us who aren't veterans should consider ourselves fortunate to only have to ponder it and not actually come to terms with it."
mal karma,"Sep 2, 2002",N/A,"Take a blockbuster and quality movies director such as Steven Spielberg, a good leading actor like Tom Hanks and a decent cast (Tom Sizemore and Edward Burns are my choices) and you'll get the best movie ever. Or you should at least. Steve got this one wrong in my opinion. Starting and ending the movie with a US flag isn't the way of making a movie hat will be shown throughout the world.The allied assault on Normandy was amazing and close to reality (I believe), making it the most remembered scene in the movie (and best).But then the plot sinks in the middle of the Atlantic ocean. Yes, sending 8 soldiers to rescue 1 just because his brothers are dead does seem unlikely and I wouldn't risk the lives of a capable platoon for only one soul.And making that chickenheart corporal Upham's mind change fast enough to make him shoot an unarmed man at point blank does nothing good to this movie.Overrated; The Thin Red Line and Black Hawk Down are much better. It's not bad, really, but I just can't figure out what the hell is so goo about it."
fudd99,"Jun 27, 2001",8/10,"The beach scenes are absolutely fantastic, and I'm not sure if I did breathe at all during those sequences. The sound and the effects are amazing, the use of small hand cams gave the whole thing a documentary feeling of the hell that met the men who landed on the beach. Sadly after that it is not too good, and the film quickly becomes a standard Hollywood WW2 film, with heroic Americans and stupid German soldiers. A better story and less sentimentality (everyone understands that young men being blow to pieces is a tragedy and this need not be pointed out by the director. The price for freedom is high)would have given this film a 10/10. I think the men who laid down their lives on the beaches in the fight to free Europe deserves more than this."
dee.reid,"Jun 28, 2005",10/10,"It seemed impossible (or was it inevitable?), but director Steven Spielberg did the unthinkable: he made a war movie. The creative and legendary mind behind such kiddie movies like ""E.T. the Extraterrestrial"" (1982) or ""Hook"" (1991) and who had ventured into more mature territory with ""Schindler's List"" (1993) made a movie that put a human face on the horrors of the World War II conflict. We know how personal WWII is to Spielberg (especially to anyone who's seen ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" - he just loves to stick it those diabolical Nazis, or the aforementioned ""Schindler's List""), but after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" (1998), our assertions at just HOW personal it is to him are revealed. Opening on D-Day (June 6, 1944) at Omaha Beach in Normandy, France, the grainy cinematography and jerky camera movements are relentlessly imposing in capturing the graphic battlefield carnage of that day. We watch in horror as one after one, Allied soldiers are butchered by the automatic weapons being unloaded on them by the Germans that had taken up positions on the hills in front of them. In the middle of the chaos, is Captain Miller (Tom Hanks), as he leads his men from the sandy, bullet and body-riddled beach up to the top of the hill. In the scenes that follow, Spielberg is unflinching as we see American soldiers as well Germans become the casualties of history's costliest conflict. The movie doesn't end there; it's only the beginning and the main plot of the film, which is supposedly based on a true story, takes shape. It turns out, that an American mother is going to receive three telegrams in one day, each one informing her that her three sons have all been killed in the D-Day invasion. But there is hope: her fourth son, a paratrooper, the eponymous Private Ryan (Matt Damon, in what could essentially be considered a cameo) of the film's title, survived. The problem is, he's located deep behind enemy lines, and it'll take a small squad of American soldiers to bring him home, as word of this small victory will serve the army good on the home front. Miller leads his squad, which includes Sergeant Horvath (Tom Sizemore), Private Reiben (Edward Burns), Private Jackson (Barry Pepper), Private Mellish (Adam Goldberg), T-4 Medic Wade (Giovanni Ribisi), Private Caparzo (Vin Diesel) and the unproven translator Corporal Upham (Jeremy Davies), deep into the French countryside to rescue Private Ryan and bring him home. It should be stated foremost that this is not an easy movie to sit through. I remember hearing stories from when this film first came about out how WWII veterans who were at D-Day had to be escorted out of the theaters because it was too much for them to handle. But still, that is its goal: ""Saving Private Ryan"" is the most realistic, gritty, and horrifically violent war movie I've ever seen. It does the impossible task of shedding itself of the stigmas (patriotic flag-waving, one-dimensional soldiers, one-sided portraits of the enemy, no battle-related carnage, etc.) that haunted many WWII films made during the '50s and '60s; contrary to some reviews, none of this goes on in this film. The film is immediately effective in its portrait of soldiers on both sides of the WWII battle, and the cost it waged on them. The performances are flawless, as Spielberg is able to get commanding talent out of all the actors involved. The action, if you can sit through it, will definitely make you squirm in your seat at how realistic it is. It should also be noted that nearly every war film since this one has tried to mimic the style of ""Saving Private Ryan,"" but they can't ever live up to its originality and raw intensity. ""Saving Private Ryan"" is Spielberg's WWII masterpiece, and is my favorite war movie. It's no wonder Spielberg was voted #1 director of all time; this film proves why.10/10"
gregory-anderson-2,"Apr 24, 2006",9/10,"Spielberg mines a sullied gem with this bloody classic. A family film, I say, a demonstration of brotherhood and integrity. For me the decision to seek Private Ryan based on the mother's loss simultaneously undermines and glorifies the honour of war. And it is in this background that Hanks delivers a compelling performance worthy of many rewatches.The violence in this film is stark. So many examples you can think of - from the escaped German prisoner's revenge, to the sockbomb victim - show the arbitrary nature of violence. But the quieter moments between are tender and contemplative - Fubar anyone? Not a realist film, like Platoon or Full Metal Jacket, but art to provoke, like Jar Head and Apocalypse Now."
Jinx 138,"Jun 19, 1999",10/10,"The first time I saw this movie was in the cinema. The surround sound at the landing on the normandy made me ducking scared in my seat. I was panicked and could feel the soldiers' fear. I saw it today for the second time on my vcr, I was alone. But this time all my tears broke loose. I now realized the lack of sense in all this killing, all this waste of life! These hundreds of young men dying on the shores of France. A stunning and precious experience. In my eyes this is the best antiwarfilm ever made. No palliation, no exaggeration."
droogiedim77,"May 29, 2002",6/10,"so overrated. this film relies is saved by its gore and superb performances from tom hanks and tom sizemore. i dont see what the deal is all about. outside of jaws, and the indiana jones trilogy he hasnt made an excellent movie in his entire career. this movie is made cheesy by its use of a flashback to frame the story. not only that, it drags in parts by adding humor and trite dialogue where it should be focusing on the action. i think most of the credit to this film should go to the director of photography, the effect and make-up crew and tom hanks and tom sizemore. too bad that stalker never made it all the way to spielberg."
tgtround,"Feb 15, 2001",5/10,"I can't believe that this film currently rates on IMDB higher than both Paths of Glory and Platoon. The latter is one of the best anti-war films ever made - by a man WHO WAS ACTUALLY THERE.Speilberg's technical mastery may be great but his characters are cardboard and his understanding of men's motivation's is fatally flawed. As Oliver Stone recognises in Platoon, soldiers fight for one another not a great cause. As the Platoon Sergeant says in Hamburger Hill regarding the death of one of the men: 'He died taking out that automatic weapon for you and third squad - and don't you give him anything less.'"
Bacco,"Mar 2, 2001",N/A,"Just a couple of things :first of all I would like to say that ""History is written by winners"", please think about that. Hollywood productions don't give any objective account of WW2.Regarding ""Saving Private Ryan"" : at the beginning of the movie 2 hundred *poor* Americans are ruthlessly slaughtered by a punch of faceless ""Huns"" who are defending the beach. At the end of the movie an *heroic* punch of Americans are defending a bridge by killing 2 hundred SS and by destroying 2 Tiger tanks with sticky bombs (!) and hand-thrown mortar ammunitions (!!).In both cases Germans are dumb and on the wrong side, either as killers or as victims!It is my opinion that soldiers of both armies were equally forced to fight by orders from above and inspired by boastful belief. There is nothing really heroic in war.If you want to find a more believable perspective of operation Overlord try Max Hasting's book ""Overlord"" (1984). You'll learn much more about the poor performance of American infantry and ""evil"" Germans' fighting prowess."
Boba Fett,"Nov 5, 1999",9/10,Saving Private Ryan is a true horror movie.  I watched it because I wanted to see a good action movie but the opening sequence really scared the hell out of me and the movie left me pondering over it for hours afterwords.It's great that there is a movie that shows war's effects on the human body and mind rather than a toned down political chess game.  This movie has some amazing cinematography with lots of gray colors to add to the gloom.Spielburg always manages to create movies that stir up emotions like no other director can.  Spielburg and George Lucas are the dynamic duo of cinema.
paul_m_haakonsen,"Dec 19, 2015",8/10,"""Saving Private Ryan"" is one of those movies that you can watch with regular intervals of time, and even if you've seen it multiple times and am familiar with the storyline, the movie is solid enough to be watched over and over, and keeps on being entertaining.The story, quickly summarized, is about a small squad of soldiers during the 2nd World War who are given a mission to find private Ryan in war-torn Europe after having survived the D-Day onslaught at Omaha Beach.What makes ""Saving Private Ryan"" good, is a combination of multiple things. First, of course, is the storyline. But also the way it is filmed, which puts the audience right in the midst of the action. Most importantly, though, is the more than impressive cast who perform above and beyond the call of duty so to speak, no pun intended.The action is formidable and impressive, showing that war is brutal and bloody. And it is presented in a very realistic manner, again adding to the conviction of the entire movie.The cast list for ""Saving Private Ryan"" was impressive. And there is a number of actors who really prove their acting talents and break out of the stereotypical roles and genres they tend to cling to. Tom Hanks, of course, is the center of the movie and he fitted so well into the role and the movie. Usually I am not particularly fond of Tom Sizemore, but he was perfect for this movie and did a great job. Ted Danson was a breath of fresh air, and he was a great addition to the movie, as were Paul Giamatti. Barry Pepper was phenomenal in his role and brought a good amount of flavor to the movie. However, for me, it was Jeremy Davies who was the most outstanding of all in the movie, proving once again what a phenomenal character actor he is.And it is always a plus when Germans actually do speak German in a World War 2 movie, and not have those awful German accents added when they in fact are speaking English.""Saving Private Ryan"" is a movie experience that everyone should have, at least once. It is an impressive and very entertaining movie to say the least."
drqshadow-reviews,"Sep 15, 2014",9/10,"Gripping, horrific first-person experiences in the thick of World War II, as you're already, no doubt, keenly aware. It's held up exceptionally well over time, most likely due to the great lengths taken by Spielberg and company to stamp it down in a specific era and remain steadfastly historical. The Normandy beach landing that opens the action is still as powerful and haunting as ever, an effects showcase like none other that puts us right down in the middle of hell itself. I couldn't help but pontificate about the futility of ground warfare here, faced with row after row of doe-eyed teenagers, unceremoniously mowed down before taking so much as a single step on enemy territory. Which is part of its message, no doubt - though that's somewhat countered by the tales of bravado, camaraderie and character that sprawl out over the next two hours. A richly rounded war story, it enjoys a mess of acting performances even stronger than the work of the effects team. Tom Hanks is at the top of the mountain as Captain Miller, a demanding role that he owns from moment one. Supporting faces pop out of the woodwork at every corner; most of us remember Vin Diesel and Adam Goldberg in early roles, but quick shots from Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Bryan Cranston and more left my jaw agape. How did I miss spotting these guys the last time? A true epic, profound and moving, with plenty of action but just as much character-building and adventure also in the mix. One of Spielberg's - and Hanks's - best."
ChristianUnchained,"Apr 23, 2013",10/10,"Spielberg directs a rapturous, deep, heavy hitting film that captures the violence, brotherhood, intensity and grip of World War II. It's an emotionally rewarding film that I took way to long to see. It is a must see film that features a brilliant and well acted cast, incredibly well orchestrated battle scenes that Sun Tzu could only dream of, and an ending that ties the whole of the work up perfectly. It's raw, it's real, and it's powerful. It's an emotionally rewarding film that I took way to long to see. And it makes you proud of the people that sacrificed their lives to protect all that we hold dear today.5/5 Stars"
rasoolyfarhad,"Mar 12, 2022",10/10,"Brutal, honest, captivating, revolutionary, saving private Ryan has more than enough positives to make it a classic. A war couldn't be represented in a more honest way. Nowadays action movies all lack what made saving private Ryan good cinema while also being a great war movie: the characters and their interactions and their motives. The best part of the movie isn't war sequences(although they are some of the best war sequences i've seen), it was that calm and subtle moments of dialogue and revealations that made the movie so great and astonishing, nowaday action movies don't get that."
mdisandro14,"Jun 5, 2019",10/10,This is by the most realistic and intense war movie I have ever seen. The first 20 minutes really puts it into perspective what young men sacrificed for our freedom. Great movie. 10 stars can be enjoyed multiple times. Definitely a tough watch at times.
kydprwn,"Sep 29, 2023",7/10,"The Good:
I watched this movie many times and I finally feel like I can write a fair and balance review. The first time I watched it, the movie visuals were spectacular and action sequences were compelling that kept you on the ""edge of your seat"". To Steven Spielberg's credit, the filmmaking and effects of saving private Ryan was revolutionary in that no past war movie had this amount of realism. Battle scenes were gripping and entertaining. Thats where 7 comes from.The Bad:
After rewatching it on HD, I realized what had bugged me. The German army is made up of complete morons, shouting and clucks about like headless chicken while getting shot. I will use the final battle sequence as illustration. The German army gets ambushed in a village, they get mowed down but machine gun positions and picked off by a sniper in a row, wave after wave after wave...In reality, do you really think Germans won't know to regroup after the initial shock of the ambush? You'd expect them to now see that there's an US machine gun position ahead or sniper picking your buddies off. There were plenty of buildings or rubble for germans to find cover. But no! Let's charge down the same narrow path where you buddies were gunned down moments ago and expect different results.I will admit that, the quality of the German army of 1944 was no longer the same as the German army of 1941. There were, however, still veteran troops, and they were not suicidal idiots as portrayed.In conclusion, movie visuals were spectacular. Script was lackluster. Portrayal of the German lack believability upon closer inspection. Just an expertly done ""propaganda""."
hannahjodie,"Feb 12, 2018",N/A,I Had To Watch Saving Private Ryan At School... Violence And Gore Is Too Graphic In This Film... So Much So That When Watching It I Wanted To Run Out Of The Room. I'm Not Saying It Is A Bad Film: I Like Tom Hanks And Steven Speilberg But This Film Ends Up Giving You Nightmares For Two Weeks And Makes You Feel Like A Nervous Wreck. Acting Is Good But Too Graphic And Very Violent... This Film Is Denfinetly Not A Childrens Film. I Recommend It To People Aged Eighteen+ Overall Good If You Dont Mind Anything Graphic. Just Not For Me Though...
davidburkett-46818,"Oct 8, 2021",10/10,"***NO spoilers***
I seldom give 10 stars. If the first 20/30 minutes doesn't deeply move you then I don't know what will. The character depth, the cinematography, the storyline, it's simply amazing. This is genuinely one of the best films ever made. The human story is second to none. And not just with the main protagonist. It is second to none.A cinematic masterpiece. One of the highest ranking films you absolutely have to watch. It's simply astounding."
jhaggardjr,"Jan 27, 2002",10/10,"Five years after ""Schindler's List"", director Steven Spielberg delivered another powerful motion picture drama, ""Saving Private Ryan"". This movie (set during WWII) tells the story of a group of soldiers (led by Army captain Tom Hanks) who go into France to find a private who's three brothers were killed in action, and send him home. The opening 30 minute D-Day sequence is one of the most harrowing movie scenes ever filmed. The story is exceptional, the directing is brilliant, and the acting is excellent. Tom Hanks is terrific as usual, and is supported by an outstanding cast which includes Matt Damon (""Good Will Hunting""), Tom Sizemore (""Black Hawk Down""), Edward Burns (""She's the One""), Vin Diesel (""The Fast and the Furious""), Adam Goldberg (""A Beautiful Mind""), Jeremy Davies (""Twister""), Barry Pepper (""61*""), Giovanni Ribisi (""subUrbia""), and Ryan Hurst (""Remember the Titans""). Some of these actors have gone on to bigger things since this movie but they're all good here. Popular TV star Ted Danson (TV's ""Cheers"" and ""Becker"") and veteran character actor Dennis Farina (""Midnight Run"" and ""Get Shorty"") even turn up in cameos. ""Saving Private Ryan"" should have won the Best Picture Oscar for 1998 because it's a war movie that's harrowing and powerful. It did go on to win 5 Oscars including Spielberg's Best Director win. It's one of the best war movies ever made.**** (out of four)"
emperor_bender,"Mar 10, 2008",10/10,"This movie was an instant classic.Everything about this movie was perfect. I could not find a single flaw in the acting, storyline, effects, etc.First, there's a perfect cast. Tom Hanks was the perfect choice to play Capt. John Miller. Tom Sizemore filled the part as Miller's ""side-kick"", Sgt. Mike Horvath very nicely. Edward Burns was very good as the antagonizing Pvt. Richard Reiben. Barry Pepper was great as the sniper, Pvt. Daniel Jackson Adam Goldberg was good as the emotional Pvt. Stanley Mellish. Giovanni Ribisi was excellent as the shy medic, Pvt. Irwin Wade. Jeremy Davies was actually funny and good at the same time playing the clutzy, peace-loving, nervous Pvt. Timothy Upham. Even Vin Diesel gave an excellent performance as the tough Pvt. Adrian Caparzo. Matt Damon was great for the limited time he was in the movie as Pvt. James Francis Ryan.The gore and special FX were first class. Everything looked so real. It was as if they were in the actual battles. D-Day landing at Dog One was particularly gory and well made. This movie must have had one hell of a huge budget, and it payed off big time.The sound score went excellent with every scene. It really made you feel for the events that were occurring.The story was also great. Usually war movies have a pointless storyline but Saving Private Ryan proves them wrong with a story of its own.This movie was perfect, Spielberg at his best. It deserves its place on the top 250.I recommend this to war/action movie fans of all kinds. 10/10."
mfellipecampos,"Jun 7, 2020",9/10,"What to expect from a war movie, and still being quite long is Saving Private Ryan? It was one of the most enjoyed films of the genre. Of course, the film does not bring many scenes where we have beautiful conflicts, because it is well but focused on the dialogues of the characters. And by the way, they are beautiful dialogues. Photography, without comments, and sound editing is another very positive point, where explosions of grenades and mortars, join intense noises of so, that that gave cheer to more in the film. And finally, Spielberg's beautiful direction, together with a well-prepared cast with good names ...Film seen on June 6, 2020."
infinitetyler,"Jul 7, 2024",10/10,"The one time I saw this movie was when it was released in theaters, and I remember the sound and visuals were so overwhelming during the D-Day scene that it was almost sensory overload. I made sure to turn the volume up for the re-watch but it doesn't do it justice, so if you see that 'Saving Private Ryan' is playing at local art house theater, GO!The movie is a top-to-bottom masterpiece, and at this point there's nothing I can add to the discussion. It ranks 71 on AFI Top 100, which IMHO seems a little low, but it certainly deserves to be on the list.A couple of surprises which did not have meaning to me 25 years ago: Vin Diesel is in the movie, and he has a completely different voice. Also Nathan Fillion of 'Firefly' fame pops in for a cameo.If you haven't seen 'Saving Private Ryan', you should, because it's a cultural touchstone and a masterful piece of art. It attempts to portray the horrors of historical events accurately, so it's not for people who require sanitizing or are made uncomfortable by the challenges faced by people during war."
troy-daniel-bush,"Mar 18, 2022",9/10,"It's a wonderful piece of filmmaking in every way and it's amazing how well everything came together.Everything just feels and looks real.Fair warning, it's not an easy watch. The combat and carnage, even when it's Nazis dying, is shockingly scary and visceral. And by the time the film wraps, and it doesn't feel like it takes three hours to get there, you feel about as exhausted as the survivors of the final battle.This is easily the best directing I've seen from Spielberg, for reasons you either need to figure out for yourself or already know.This film holds up extraordinarily well and it will continue to hold up for years to come."
VicTheDaddy,"May 24, 2006",7/10,"I'm usually a big fan of Spielberg,but in this film he comes across as a bit to anti-German,he may have his reasons and i think he has made them clear in Schindlers List,and i understand his feelings.But i think for a big epic like this it would have been better to have an unbiased portrayal of Germans so the film would have been universally admired,instead its coming across as anti-German propaganda especially when there is so much American flag-waving.Being English i have the same problem with Braveheart,Scots=good English=bad,this is really one dimensional character study,which just teaches people to live in ignorance,we all need to learn to move on.Surely its better to make films every culture is going to relate to,flag waving just promotes arrogance which leads to looking down on others.The other big problem i have with this film is that the Brits are not mentioned,or if we are i must have missed it,i must have blinked.This was a decisive battle and i know like thousands of other Brits we were involved,so whats the big idea?It would be like us making a film about the Somme or Ypes and not bothering to mention the Canadian and Australian involvement,that would be unforgivable."
Morbo,"Apr 4, 2000",1/10,"""Best war movie of all time"", ""one of my favorites"" and so on...please!The beginning is awesome with amazing action scenes but then what..? It's the usual ""USA saves the world"" with who-would-have-guessed-it heroes and nauseating flag waving and other clichés. I just can't believe that this movie is considered to be the 14th best (or 12th or whatever it is right now...) of all time!?!What's most surprising about Saving Private Ryan is that all the Americans who watched it could get out from the theaters with their big heads. They can't honestly say that this is how they thought WWII was, can they?? All Americans and not a Brit, Frenchman or anyone of another nationality in sight.This movie was made for an American crowd and to make money at the box office. Not to make a believable story about D-day.It's supposed to be really emotional when an American gets killed or injured but the Germans are shot down indiscriminately. This is sickening to me! Is an American life worth more than a German? Spielberg seems to think it is..."
gdownton,"Jan 14, 2003",N/A,"Maybe my summary line was a bit harsh. Saving Private Ryan is not an average movie, but I don't think it's as great as the rest of the world seems to think. Yes the various battle scenes are gut-wrenching, but the movie overall was slightly disappointing.Firstly, the film is completely US-centric. I think one non-American character (a German soldier who is begging for his life at the time) gets a speaking role in the film. There is no indication that soldiers from other countries took part in the D-day landings. The American soldiers die horribly, tragically, heroically, dramatically. The German soldiers just die. Bang, grunt, thud: another dead German.We see all of the tension and fear experienced by the Americans, yet none of that which must have been felt by the opposing Germans. They were, after all, one and the same, merely servants of opposing political masters. Yet the movie completely misses the chance to humanise the enemy, to show that they too are just ordinary people in extraordinary circumstances.Saving Private Ryan is, in short, a Hollywood blockbuster, with gory battle bits. The American soldiers are the human good guys, the German soldiers are the inhuman bad guys, war is Hell, but we're better at it than you.I didn't *hate* this movie, I just didn't think it was worth all of the plaudits which it has received. Tom Hanks is, of course, always watchable, the story rolls along nicely, the battle scenes will keep you on the edge of your seat (or possibly under it), and the anti-war grittiness does outweigh the pro-American good vs. bad slant. For the record, I thought the spin-off TV series Band of Brothers was marginally better."
blackwelljames-93073,"Jun 13, 2021",10/10,"Rewatching this film I enjoyed it as much as I remembered. Amazing cast, excellent character development and realistic fight scenes. Hasn't aged a bit. Still one of the best war movies ever."
stevenbernard-07913,"Oct 3, 2021",9/10,"The intro of the movie... something that everyone should see to understand what the word ""war"" actually means."
RobTheWatcher,"Apr 15, 2022",10/10,"An absolutely perfect film. It feels like more than a movie and like a story being shared with us. The story has so many intricate details and stories within the story while still maintaining the reality and integrity of WW2. The production and filming of this for being made in 1998 is sensational. Honestly, somewhere along the way we've lost the ability to make such true and authentic movies like this."
Maniac-9,"Jan 21, 2012",10/10,Out of all the nominations for Best Picture in 1998 at the Academy Awards I'm still baffled how this one isn't the movie to take home the statue. Instead you have some lame Shakespeare in Love get that honor that no one in this century even remembers. You don't see SiL getting re-played on cable all the time like SPR does. You don't have a great half hour opening scene like in SPR with the Normandy scene which is one of the best scenes in motion picture history.Spielberg and Hanks with this and then followed up with the miniseries Band of Brothers and The Pacific basically reinvented what a depiction of war should look like on film.
Calicodreamin,"Apr 14, 2021",9/10,An authentic war movie that doesn't hold back showing the heartbreaking toll combat takes on men. The storyline was well developed and the cinematography was fittingly grim. The characters were well cast and well acted. Hanks at his finest.
kishorepapolu,"Mar 18, 2021",10/10,No doubt why Tom hanks is considered one of the best actors.
wmarkley,"Dec 10, 2005",6/10,"Yes, ""Saving Private Ryan"" has very graphic action scenes which are more realistic than the average war movie, but there are other aspects in which it fails in being authentic: the attitudes, behaviors and values of the people in the time period which the movie depicts. In particular, some of the major and minor characters of ""S.P.R."" exhibit very self-absorbed characteristics which would have been very uncommon among regular troops during World War II. Sure, people have some of the same feelings and other characteristics throughout history, and soldiers frequently grumble and are cynical, but the people shown in this movie tend to reflect much more what 1990's guys were like rather than 1940's men. For a war movie which does a better job of showing 1940's troops, try ""Battleground.""Like many others here, I like war movies to be authentic in depicting things like uniforms, equipment and tactics, and ""S.P.R."" is successful in some of this, but to me it is more important for a movie to be accurate in depicting character, attitude and the actual events that occurred, and in this ""S.P.R"" is very lacking. It does a better job of demonstrating Spielberg's 1990's limousine-liberal biases. This is especially seen in the character depictions. Another kind of example which is comparatively minor is how the German troops' haircuts in ""S.P.R."" tend to look more like those of late-20th Century skinheads than what German SS and Wehrmacht troops usually wore.Also, I think that the reviewer James Bowman makes a good point about movies such as ""S.P.R."" and ""Flags of Our Fathers:"" ""...perhaps showing too much respect for the suffering is not to show enough respect for the man. For if we suppose, as some of us still do, that these men suffered for something  to wit, their duty, their honor, their country  don't these thing deserve just a little bit of respect as well?...""To get an idea of what the Normandy Campaign was like, you would be much better off reading non-fiction accounts of it, and listening to comments by actual men who were there. It takes much more than gushing blood, flying body parts and the message ""War is hell"" to constitute a great war film. If you want to see cinematic movies which do a better job than ""S.P.R."" of depicting some of the general look and feel of war, and the characters and attitudes of people of the World War II period, try ""Talvisota"" and ""Der Untergang."" Also, ""A Bridge Too Far"" is very good, especially for a blockbuster-type movie. ""A Bridge Too Far"" has a few very minor inaccuracies, some composite characters and some simplifications of the real events, but it does an excellent job of showing the characters of troops and civilians, and it is mostly factual. ""The Longest Day,"" while it includes some Hollywood flourishes, also is very good. It doesn't have the special effects and combat realism of ""S.P.R.,"" but it is almost completely based on facts, which counts for a lot with me, and for which I rank it much higher than ""S.P.R."" ""The Longest Day"" also has one of the most impressive large-scale depictions of combat in any movie, showing the storming of a German position by a Free French unit."
henrycoles9,"Jul 9, 2020",10/10,And happy birthday to Tom Hanks! I can't believe I happened to watch this seminal must-see movie for the first time in my life exactly on his birthday.
kuch54,"Jun 7, 2024",10/10,"As a veteran myself, who has stood on the beaches of Normandy. It's not hard to get overwhelmed thinking about the honor, courage, commitment, and sacrifice of the young men who stormed the beaches I visited 79 years later. Quite frankly the greatest war movie ever depicted on screen.As in the opening scenes, you can walk the same path as the greatest generation did. Although there is a little tourist town slightly creeping in, the beaches themselves are incredibly serene. They probably aren't much different then they were back then. The American cemetery is a beautiful resting spot for these brave souls. It's so peaceful that one has to remember what happened there. Saving Private Ryan is a necessary watch for any who lived after."
Elvis-Del-Valle,"Feb 15, 2025",10/10,"After Schindler's List and Empire Of The Sun, Steven Spielberg has made yet another portrait of World War II that is as amazing and moving as the previous two films. Spielberg is someone who has quite a bit of recognition in the world of science fiction, but his greatest skill is telling deep stories with very human characters and he manages to do that through any film genre. In the case of war films, he manages to do that while portraying the wounds left by the horrors of war.Saving Private Ryan already captures the viewer's attention from the beginning with a shocking combat scene. This scene takes up more than the first 30 minutes of the film and with that he manages to make the viewer enter into the story. After that very effective introduction, the film follows Captain Miller and his squad in search of Private Ryan. What we see is a much more realistic and dramatic story of soldiers in a war zone. There is a good balance between action and drama making the combat sequences spectacular and at the same time feeling quite tense when seeing the soldiers in danger. The action scenes feel like real, gritty, dangerous situations. They adequately recreate the carnage that was caused in the middle of the battlefield. We see how the bodies of the soldiers are torn apart in the explosions, making the fighting quite raw.The acting is so good that you can see the sense of horror and fear that the soldiers felt in such a situation reflected. Also, when the soldiers are not fighting, we see them having conversations that don't seem like much, but it shows that the soldiers are human beings with goals and hopes. The rescue mission happens because one of the high command began to reflect on what it is like for a mother to lose all her children in the war. While three brothers have died, saving the fourth brother who might still be alive is a humanitarian act that offers a sliver of hope that some soldiers will be able to survive to return home to their families. A dream that the soldiers themselves have and that is captured in the film. We even see that Ryan is willing to fight to make sure that some of his comrades can return home. While there are soldiers who fight only to follow orders, in this film we see that the soldiers fight for their comrades and for the desire for them to survive. War films have offered different facets of war and the soldiers who participate in it. Some in a heroic way, others as a torment that causes psychological damage and the rest focusing more on the humanity of the soldiers. Steven Spielberg had focused on the humanity of the soldiers with this film using what he had done in his previous war films. In addition, it retains some more common elements of American war films such as patriotism and American pride or the heroism of a soldier sacrificing his life to save another.All of this makes this a masterpiece of war cinema by portraying both the pain of the soldiers and the brutal battles with excellent precision. There is no doubt that Saving Private Ryan is one of the best war films in history that has managed to endure thanks to its good plot and special effects. It should not even be forgotten that the filming techniques for combat scenes influenced war films, action films and even superhero films long after the film was released. Although it has fictional elements and some historical errors, that does not erase the fact that Saving Private Ryan is a great film with an accurate view of war. It is ideal to know how horrible and painful it was to fight in war. My final rating for this film is 10/10."
mr.blond,"Jul 29, 1998",10/10,"After seeing Saving Private Ryan, I was changed forever.  As a person twice removed from the war generation (18 years of age), my only experience from the great World War II were from films such as ""The Longest Day"" and ""Patton"", all seemed to make me want to make a contribution equivalent, as far as fighting for my country, but after seeing ""Saving Private Ryan"" I wish to make a contribution as equal to those who fought and died, but I no longer wish to endure that hardship, and that is a luxury we as a generation can enjoy."
MrFilmAndTelevisionShow,"Jul 16, 2021",9/10,"Althought War films, at least the ones I've seen are always gripping and interesting, they aren't a genre I am particularly interested in. That said I've seen this film a number of times and I think it is great. Definitely worth a watch for people interested in the war, fans of Tom Hanks, or fans of good films in general."
fbreedon,"Mar 27, 2019",10/10,"Growing up in the golden age era of war films, I have always had a 'glamorized' idea of soldiering. I remember as a child watching a soldier get hit, and his telling his buddies ""go on without me"" and quietly passing on. Saving Private Ryan changed all that for me. The use of sound in this movie truly puts the viewer into the action. The sounds of bullets and explosions combined with the graphic, but true to life, reactions of soldiers being hit makes the horror of war seem very real to those of us who have never served in combat. Screams of soldiers for their mothers, soldiers in shock picking up their own limbs, and soldiers being vaporized by explosions are all too real. No film before, or since, has had the same affect on a viewer. Every American should be required to watch this film in history class to be given a realistic understanding of the sacrifices that so many made in protecting our freedom."

Ripe Peach,"Jan 19, 2001",1/10,"I can't be the only person who thinks this is Starship Troopers with the Evil Nazi Scourge standing in for the Bugs.For one, the combat scenes are no more war-is-hell realistic and bloody than Starship Troopers.  It's nice to see protagonists who aren't superhuman, but this is only a (moderately) original take for big budget blockbusters, it's hardly ground breaking cinema.Just as in Starship Troopers, the characters barely qualify as one dimensional, and I can't be the only one who found them so irritatingly stereotypical that SPR almost qualifies as a parody.A particular point of interest is that Mr Spielberg's Evil Nazi Scourge are portrayed only slightly more sympathetically than the Bugs in Starship Troopers.  If you get your knowledge of history from Hollywood (which a lot of people do), then you'd be forgiven for thinking that every single German was a soulless Nazi who deserved to die, and that WWII was just USA vs Japan and Germany.  I do have a fair amount of sympathy for Spielberg's stance, but it's interesting to compare his sweeping generalisations with 1930's Nazi anti-Jewish, anti-Romany propaganda.  It's sad but not really surprising that Spielberg's audience accepts his skewed message just as unquestioningly as the German moviegoers did in the 1930's.The idea for SPR is actually sound, but the implementation is just so overdone that I really can't bring myself to care about any of it, other than to feel contempt for the brutal liberties it takes with history.  If I'm going to watch good-vs-bad fantasy, I'd prefer to stick with Starship Troopers which at least doesn't try to pass itself off as something significant and profound."
Bernie4444,"Oct 6, 2024",10/10,"All wars are different but some contain similar elements. I was in Tet-68 and can relate to many of the attitudes in this picture. I also had a father that was in WWII. So, we compared stories.Because of the nature of the movie and the Spielberg effects, this movie lends itself to all the latest resolution, color, and sound equipment of the day and will probably adapt to future presentation features. Many people are more fascinated with the movie's sound, resolution, and color than the story or acting, or message.I saw the streaming 4K version, so I am more fascinated with the extra information on the screen that tells a lot of the background of the making of the movie and how it fared in various countries. We find out where the concept of the story originated. We learn that the main town is fictitious but based on many other towns. We also get the filming locations and interest in the color filtering of the movie for artistic purposes.The basic story is that there are four brothers (Ryan) that go to war and three are killed. After reading a letter from President Abraham Lincoln on the same situation in the American Civil War it is decided that the fourth brother needs to be found and sent home. So, the over theme is about doing just that. However, in the process, we are given a lot to think about as each soldier on the mission grows with each step they take. Will they find Private Ryan and if so, what then?You can see Spielberg's hand in this and among the great actors is Tom Hanks giving a stellar performance. Yet I think that the process reminds me more of aJoseph Campbellhero's journey."

Saving Private Ryan is a monumental achievement in filmmaking, directed by Steven Spielberg. The film's opening D-Day sequence is often hailed as one of the most realistic portrayals of war ever captured on screen, immersing viewers in the chaos and horror of battle. Tom Hanks delivers a powerful performance as Captain Miller, leading a diverse group of soldiers on a mission to find Private Ryan. The film's gritty realism and emotional depth resonate long after viewing, making it not just a war movie but a profound commentary on sacrifice and humanity. It's truly one of the greatest films ever made."

martinpersson97,"Dec 3, 2021",9/10,"This Steven Spielberg masterpiece can not be understated in its greatness.Everything from the cinematography, well-cut war scenes and it's score is just flawless.Beneath all of that beats a heart with an emotional narrative, accompined by incredible acting and great writing.The battle scenes, though, are simply incredible and some of the best ever seen on film. Many movies afterwards have tried to replicate this, both in terms of action, tone and character work.One of the great war movies, for sure!"
Anonymous_Maxine,"May 27, 2000",9/10,"As a die-hard Steven Spielberg fan, I find it difficult to give such a tremendously powerful film like Saving Private Ryan anything less than a 10, but there were a couple of things in the film that caused huge problems for me, mainly because they could have been avoided so easily. For example, whose brilliant idea was it to cast a teenage heartthrob like Matt Damon (and yes, I realize that he is not a teen himself, but he is extremely popular among junior high school girls) in the role of a private in a World War II film?! Tom Hanks was perfect, but only because he is one of the best actors working right now, and he can do a great job in virtually any role. Furthermore, Ted Danson literally stops the film in its tracks.However, Saving Private Ryan, despite these superficial problems, is a truly timeless film, and is an extremely powerful depiction of the brutality of World War II. Besides being hugely entertaining, a lot can be learned from this film. It is a landmark in filmmaking history and should not be missed."
tsizzlemorgan,"Feb 11, 2025",8/10,"This is a wonderful film. I need to preface this by saying I do not like war films that much. They aren't often the type that interests me, particularly those that aren't exaggerated or stylistic. I often watch movies that are an escape from reality, or comment on it, instead of ones that are very realistic depictions of one of the harshest areas of it. Remember this, and know that my review should not sway you from watching this, because I'm the last person you should ask about a war movie (unless it's 1917. I'll talk to you for hours about that movie)All that being said, it feels criminal to give this less than a 4 star review. A bit more style would have grabbed my attention longer, but it also could have distracted from the meaning. That's also not to knock the cinematography of the film. It is undeniably good, just not anything groundbreaking. Beyond this, I could have done with a little less of a running time, I realize why it was so long, and I appreciate that, but I would be lying if I said it didn't lose me a couple of times, or that I wasn't shocked to look at the running time at the point I was sure was the climax, to see another 50 minutes still remained.The good points of this movie make up for the long running time. It's powerful and heartfelt, and it nearly brought a tear to my eye. I get a little closer to crying watching 1917 than I did with this movie, but this is a very close second.All of my criticism aside this is a quality film, both in the content and production."
buckeyes-05926,"Apr 18, 2024",10/10,"Steven Spielberg knocks it out of the park with his war epic. Tom Hanks as always does a fantastic job. The opening scene will never be able to be topped. The ending will make any man cry. Altogether an overwhelming experience that is worth the watch. A war film that, entirely aware of its genre's conventions, transcends them as it transcends the simplistic moralities that inform its predecessors, to take the high, morally haunting ground. Spectacular, wrenching masterpiece that unflinchingly documents the random horror, the grisly spectacle and the ugliness of war. The effect is riveting and frightening. You feel you are under siege with the combatants. Overall a magnificent piece of movie-making."
vedaghav,"Jul 14, 2022",10/10,"From the very beginning of movie,it is clear the brutality and tension it want to show.The thing I liked the most was the chemistry created among characters during the war( Usually characters in war films are set-up before war sequence but this film takes a new approach)which show it's impact in the climaxVisually film is awesome.... Cinematography is on point,we feel that chaos aroundTom Hanks has as always given an award winning performance also all the other actors gave their best.Talking about climax, it is mixture of all gruesome feelings around. The dialogue's told by each character during war have it's own impact. Definitely a must watch....."

Theo Robertson,"Jan 25, 2002",4/10,"I remember when the hype when SPR was first released: "" Gawd it`s so realistic , it shows the true face of war , it`s like being there man"" I also remember that these claims were made by civilians with no experience of the military or combat ( Maybe the next time a film audience wants to experience the horrors of war, the cinema might like to stick a sniper behind the screen to pick off sundry filmgoers. That would be realistic ) To this day I haven`t heard a single D-Day survivor comment on the realism of this film.Yes I agree that the opening 20 minutes of SPR are outstanding as is the final battle at the end but the outstanding visuals fail to disguise the very average script that is no different from a John Wayne or Errol Flynn star vehicle. There`s very little depth to the story which seems at odds with the anti war visuals.I will defend the film slightly from the allegation of pro American bias. It`s an American film , made by Americans , with American money for a primarily American public. For a more subjective view on the Normandy landings see THE LONGEST DAY , or better still read the book. But the comment on Monty was uncalled for , Bernard Law Montgomery spent 4 years on the western front ( 1914-18 ) he was disgusted by the slaughter he saw there and made needless casualties his main concern. I bet the red army wished for a general like that on the Eastern front. Oh and Monty won the battle of El Alamein , thought I`d just mention it.So just to sum up SPR has some graphic battle scenes overcoming a flawed script. It`s a good film but nowhere near being a masterpiece. Maybe if it`d been set during the Korean war and been a lot more cynical it`d might have been a true classic. But as it is it`s a case of a B movie script saved by a brilliant director"

No film since last year's The Sweet Hereafter has left such a searing and indelible imprint on my mind and soul."

clausmollerandersen,"Aug 11, 2020",8/10,"One of the most crucial things to get right is war movies or documentaries, if you get it wrong and forget soldiers that died in that war then that's what people will interpret when they see the movie if they don't know any better and that erase the memories of the soldiers that died in that war.Saving Private Ryan did exactly that and sadly it's not an accident either, they meant to replace those british waterduck operators with american ones and it isn't exactly the first time they try to reap all the glory through movies.After such a tragic and selfish decision i can not give the movie more than a 8, it's not a realistic war movie if it thinks its acceptable to forget soldiers that died for their country, it's criminal.I'm not british but had i been i probably would have sued for twisting the truth to their own favour. You can not take any liberties whatsoever with wars, you must get it right or refrain from making them entirely."
filipemanuelneto,"Dec 1, 2019",9/10,"This film is located in Northern France during the Allied landing in Normandy and the weeks following it. According to the script, after the death of three brothers in combat (two in Normandy and one in the Pacific), the US Army decides to send a detachment with the mission of finding the last brother, who was launched with an infantry company. Skydiver somewhere in northern France. Only recently, after some research, did I discover that the film was based, very slightly, on a real event. The script is good, full of action scenes and will surely delight the lovers of war movies and WWII movies. Personally, I highlight the opening scenes, in which ""D-Day"" was recreated in all its raw glory, and the final part, where it all comes together in an almost perfect climax of action.The director's chair was taken by iconic Steven Spielberg, who is spotless once again. He is one of those directors who no longer has to prove anything. More than established, he was already one of the best directors of our time when he directed this movie. Even so, he did not cease to strive and to provide us with careful, attentive and thoughtful direction. At his side, in the starring role, Tom Hanks in one of the films that marked his career. Hanks is a renowned actor. Attentive to detail and emotional when it has to be, she shone once more, earning another Oscar nomination for Best Actor (though attributed to the equally remarkable Roberto Benigni, in one of the most hilarious and emotional moments the Academy ceremony has ever seen. in many decades). The supporting cast is equally good, containing names like Tom Sizemore, Edward Burns, Vin Diesel, Giovanni Ribisi, Matt Damon, Paul Giamatti, etc. Actors who, as we can see, are established and generally have solid careers today.The film shone equally on the technical details. It's a Spielberg movie, and we couldn't expect anything else. Let's look at the careful way in which the historical details were mostly recreated. The uniforms, military equipment, combat tactics were all carefully studied, and despite some flaws (such as the predominance of the Americans and the absence of other allies in the theater of war), all went well. I especially liked that they used the German language for the German soldiers. I also highlight the excellent photography, with breathtaking scenes and original camera angles (one moment we are looking through a sniper sight, and the next moment a bullet crosses that same sight towards us, to name but a few). an example), as well as the sound effects, with all those absolutely realistic bullet sounds and shots. The characterization, the special effects, the soundtrack ... all meticulously well done.Personally, I liked this movie a lot. It's one of those movies that I like to see again after a few years, but which has disappeared without a trace of the television circuit, perhaps because of its length and the fact that it is no longer a new movie. It also has some minor flaws, such as some concessions to sentimental lamechas and scenes of strong emotional appeal, but I confess that I handled it very well. The scene that seemed to me the most out of context was, in fact, a passage involving a French family with their young children. Another problem with this movie is that, with the exception of the character of Hanks, most of the characters have been underdeveloped and the actors have little to work with, just playing wars.This movie has garnered several awards. Of all, I highlight his good performance at this year's Oscars, with five statuettes collected in the technical categories (Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Edition, Best Sound and Best Sound Effects). He also won the Golden Globe for Best Dramatic Film."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Jun 12, 2011",9/10,"In the late-90s there were two particular films that redefined their particular genres. Saving Private Ryan was one of them (the other, unfortunately, was The Matrix). Almost every war movie that followed SPR, right down to 2008's Rambo, seemed to be no more than a pastiche of Spielberg's hectic style.SPR proves what an inconsistent filmmaker Spielberg can be. The man has had his fair share of misfires (Hook, anyone?) but this was his last truly great effort. War of the Worlds and Munich were good, though hardly as revolutionary, but The Terminal, Catch Me If You Can, and the movie that called itself Indy IV were all just too gutless and inoffensive. You'd never believe they were from the same director if you didn't know better.A lot of critics have repeatedly praised SPR over the years, but they all praise the same things (the documentary style, the realism, etc.) Simultaneously, a lot of people have dismissed it as shallow, badly-written, and void of any thrills beyond the 30-minute mark. But look beneath the surface and you'll find that SPR does actually have a tight screenplay, despite going through the motions on few occasions. The wide and diverse cast (including Paul Giamatti, Ted Danson, Dennis Farina, and Dale Dye) do good with the material. It's refreshing for a war movie to move beyond the 'point of view of one man' cliché.Janusz Kaminski's desaturated, gritty, high-shutter-speed photography is full of deep blacks and high contrast. This look has been imitated to death over the years, but coupled with Spielberg's hurried, almost unscripted approach to the action it adds an element of authenticity to the film that the copycats have not been able to emulate.You really have to feel for all those poor soldiers who were massacred on Omaha Beach (all men, I should point out). But what a badly planned mission. No flack jackets, no smoke screens to cover their landing...warfare has come so far in 65 years, it would be insane to send so many hundreds off to die like that now. Many of them were pure cannon fodder and the Military knew it. The film certainly does not hold back on the bloody carnage. Most WWII movies up until that point were sanitized and bloodless. Hardly realistic at all!The 169 minute running time passes fairly quickly. The film certainly doesn't deserve the criticism that nothing interesting happens after the beach invasion. As it has been imitated many times since, some of then innovative moments (such as the silent 'war is hell' amid battle chaos - which this film does three times!) have become clichés, but don't judge SPR for it.The film won 5 Oscars, but lost the Best Picture award to Shakespeare in Love, which is absolutely insane. I mean...what were they thinking??? SPR is most certainly a classic, and one of the most innovative and important war films of the past two decades, while Shakespeare in Love is largely forgotten."

eva3si0n,"Jan 24, 2021",10/10,"The best movie about war on the western front of World War II. A standard by which any military movie of Hollywood has to be guided. One of the best roles of Tom Hanks. D-Day in the movie is presented as the greatest battle of World War II. Even it is terrible to present what would be if Spielberg picturized the Stalingrad or Kursk battle. And still giving of such events is more successful for series, Band of Brothers to that the proof. 3 hours aren't enough to become attached to characters and to few screenwriter to work out key characters."
NEFARlOUS,"Nov 8, 1999",1/10,"The action scenes in this film are superb - gritty, realistic and plain nasty. However, it remains a source of irritation that such good film making is washed down with an unhealthy dose of flag-waving patriotism. What is the message of this film? That occasionally you find SOMETHING worth fighting and dying for or that it's glorious to die for your country (read Owen for further comments on this)Something else it has led to is a number of American reviewers giving the ""We died to save your a$$es"" speach. This itself is both stupid and untrue - the people who wrote those messages did nothing. America got involved only when it was directly threatened by the Nazis, and not before.I am glad, however, that such views are in a minority from the American postings - It's a pity that the many are tarred by the few.Millions of normal Europeans died in this war - from bombings, shootings, torture, starvation, disease and the Holocaust. This film made only a token attempt to reference this - nothing more.The thin red line was a much better, less commercial film with that very neccessary ingredient - a message - this one remains a catalogue of missed opportunities and a formulaic start and end."
accocoi,"Aug 1, 2024",10/10,"Matt Damon one of my favorite actor! The epic scale and action set pieces alone make this film 5 stars. The brutality and emotional toll of war is captured well in the settings and acting, especially the opening 20 minutes. My favourite battled scene however is after they find Private Ryan and the rag tag group of soldiers ambush the German army amidst the rubble of a small town. It's a very long, drawn out battle for a movie set piece but you are constantly on the edge of your seat until the final bullet. My favourite scenes in general however are when the soldiers arn't fighting and just walking in a field or forest bonding with each other."
personvivek,"Aug 19, 2021",9/10,Tom Hanks gives the performance of his life in one of the best war movies I've ever watched.
trent1776,"Aug 3, 2021",10/10,There isn't another movie out there that portrays warfare better than this one. Everything about this movie is done to perfection and Spielberg catches the human element of warfare among fellow soldiers unlike anything else. A must-watch movie for every American.
Chaser923,"Jun 26, 2021",10/10,"This is the quintessential war film. It is among the few that truly capture the impact and scale of war, while still managing to tell an amazingly put together story as well. The first 20 mins of this film is one of the most intense, insane, realistic looking things I've ever seen. Back when I watched this for the first time on Memorial Day of 2020, I don't think I'd ever seen anything quite like this before, and was not prepared at all for the sheer realism. I was still early on in my film watching days, so this really moved me. To this day, it remains my 2nd favorite movie ever. Steven Spielberg really did create a masterpiece out of this, and I'm very happy that he did. For being someone known for making all those nostalgic 80s kids type movies (like E. T., Indiana Jones, Jaws, Jurassic Park), this sure is a huge change. Like, this is on the complete opposite end of the spectrum from those films lmao.However, this is still not the best war depiction ever put on film; that would have to go to Band of Brothers. Also produced by Steven Spielberg, I guess you could say he mastered the art of making war films."
ErainaM,"Feb 2, 2018",9/10,Honestly I don't like a lot of war movies but there is the odd one that grabs my attention. This is definitely one of those. One of my favorite actors of all time. Tom plays his character with control but through his eyes full of emotion. The story is heartfelt and shows the terror that these young men faced. A must watch if you have not already.
attilaunderwood,"Apr 9, 2021",10/10,"Opening with the Allied invasion of Normandy on 6 June 1944, members of the 2nd Ranger Battalion under Cpt. Miller fight ashore to secure a beachhead. Amidst the fighting, two brothers are killed in action. Earlier in New Guinea, a third brother is KIA. Their mother, Mrs. Ryan, is to receive all three of the grave telegrams on the same day. The United States Army Chief of Staff, George C. Marshall, is given an opportunity to alleviate some of her grief when he learns of a fourth brother, Private James Ryan, and decides to send out 8 men (Cpt. Miller and select members from 2nd Rangers) to find him and bring him back home to his mother..."
rkempf-15550,"Sep 18, 2018",10/10,"One of the hardest tasks in life is dealing with the death of someone close. For some, even losing just one loved one could be impossible to handle. Unfortunately, WWII propelled very young men directly into the heart of stressful and gruesome violence, defining the survivors as some of the most emotionally hardened people to walk this earth.Saving Private Ryan delves directly into the story of a young man, Private Ryan, who because of the rules regarding death of family members in war, needs to be found and taken out of combat. Opening with an older Ryan, as he grieves the loss of a fellow soldier, instantly defining strong emotion and foreshadowing the tone of the movie. The scene quickly changes, however, throwing the viewer directly into heart-pounding action as an extremely historic and defining battle takes place, D-Day. Stress, anxiety and extreme suspense come over the viewer as bullets, explosions, and life-threatening events overcome Ryan. The movie is no stranger to strong emotion, as it quickly shows death, destruction, and gripping violence that is familiar with the soldiers on the field. The main character, Ryan, is not portrayed to be some valiant war hero either, but rather more vulnerable, and life-like. Ryan is a character people can relate to, feel for, and become much more connected to, making it much easier for the emotions to be shared between him and the viewer.Throughout Saving Private Ryan, an overall sense of urgency and looming danger is felt. Whether it be directly in the middle of heart-pounding action and excitement, defined by loud explosions, blood-curdling screams, and sounds of bullets whizzing by. Or where suspense is heavy, in the most quiet of times, where silence seems all too bliss. Visual demonstrations of intense action and perfect recreations of life-like scenes help the viewer become immersed in what is happening, almost smelling the fires burning and the gasoline filling the air.The movie does an excellent job at creating realistic and accurate scenes. Since the movie is based on a historic event, it's crucial that everything that happens needs to replicate the time that it was set in perfectly, or massive reductions in the immersive nature of the movie would be felt, and many parts would feel dull and unrealistic. However, the attention to detail is shown, as everything from the vehicles, to the technology, even down to the way people talk, using slang terms and real conversations that people in the 1940's might have, is spot on. Saving Private Ryan is an amazing, immersive and jaw-dropping movie that easily has the potential to be regarded as one of the greats for years to come."
CinemaClown,"Dec 1, 2013",N/A,"Within the opening 30 minutes into Saving Private Ryan, Steven Spielberg simply rewrote everything there ever was about warfare filmmaking, destroyed many Hollywood clichés in the process, completely redefined the combat genre & permanently cemented this film's place amongst the greatest examples of war cinema.The movie opens with the devastating but successful invasion of Normandy by Allied powers during the Second World War & the main plot surfaces after that. It concerns a band of soldiers who are assigned a new mission to go behind enemy lines in order to retrieve a missing soldier whose all brothers have been killed in action.Steven Spielberg's direction this time challenges & breaks every barrier of action filmmaking as this film is his all out assault on the film audience' psyche & takes them right into the battlefield with all the blood, bullets & limbs flying around. Add to that, the camera-work with its desaturated colour & point of view shooting gives the plot a heightened sense of realism too.Just like any other Spielberg's movie, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much fine tuned in its technical departments as the editing, visual effects, sound & everything is top-notch although John Williams' score doesn't have much to contribute to the whole film. The performances by its ensemble cast are also very good with Hanks impressing the most with his swashbuckling performance.Yet, in spite of all the praise & it putting up perhaps the most harrowing depiction of war on- screen, it isn't a flawless work & comes with its share of disappointments. The biggest drawback about Saving Private Ryan is that after its unforgettable opening sequence, the film is never able to reach the same height for the entirety of its runtime & even drags in the middle of its story only to rise again in the end.Another major problem I have with it is the film's relentless emphasis on glorifying America since some real-life events depicted here completely ignore the aid US received from other allies during the D-Day landings plus the extremely biased manner in which it portrays the German soldiers is absolutely insulting. It's specifically made for American audience & doesn't have a universal appeal like many other films of its genre.On an overall scale, Saving Private Ryan presents its esteemed director at his brutal best and with its unflinching take on the horrors of war delivers an extremely intense, powerfully moving, brutally realistic & truly unforgettable cinematic experience. It may not be the greatest war film ever made but its contribution to warfare filmmaking has been immense. And for that alone, it will forever be remembered as one of its genre's finest works."
mhmt_korkmaz,"May 14, 2020",10/10,By far the best 2nd WW movie.Scenes are so realistic that you're absorbed into the battlefield as if you were there. Excellent sound mixing and editing. Great character development. Another masterpiece from Spielberg that deserves an obvious 10/10.
pnsei,"Aug 18, 2018",10/10,The opening scene is thrilling. This is easily Ol'Tommy's best film since the original Toy Story film. He shows some raw emotion that makes you feel like you are in France with him. This film will forever go down as the pinnacle of war films.
emryse,"Apr 23, 2021",9/10,"Saving Private Ryan, as you can probably guess, is a world war 2 film, about a group of soldiers trying to find and rescue private Ryan, out of this pretty plain premise Spielberg manages to create a film full of emotion and drama, this film has some amazing set pieces and great acting and is an all around enjoyable time. The all star cast is great and I think the opening scene is one of my favourites from any film. Thoroughly Recommend It :)"
JenniferDianeHanson,"Sep 6, 2018",9/10,"Saving Private Ryan is a spectacular, and realistic looking war film, showcasing the amazing acting talents of Tom Hanks. There is a surplus of great cinematography, as well as insightful direction, in this world war period ""stage"" by Steven Spielberg. This film is scary at times, with a deep and heart wrenching theme. The special effects, mimicking the devastation and loss that battle, with the enemy unfortunately often delivers, are very accurate looking compared to historical war films.Superior acting all around. I rate this film 9 stars"
zzhhhqing,"Apr 15, 2020",10/10,"The character of Urban is very interesting, cowardly, very cowardly, and has a ridiculous romance and ignorance of kindness. He is you and me. He has a shameful fear of the cruelty of the war and has a kind illusion about it. Unfortunately, this is not the case. War is life and death. War is a time to test courage, not goodwill. The timid may survive, but in the war, you have lost. And those dead warriors, they are the winners"
yoyomagoo,"May 29, 2003",7/10,"Not Steven Spielberg's best film by a long shot (ET or Schindler's List anyone?) but certainly his most graphic, Saving Private Ryan is pretty much summed up by its tagline ""The Mission is a Man"". The film is simple, almost to the point of frustration and possibly Spielberg wanted it this way to highlight some of the themes running throughout the film (war is, um... bad). However what it amounts to is poor storytelling. Coming from Spielberg, a man who prides himself for storytelling, this is a disappointment.Tom Hanks plays the everyman, again, as a reluctant schoolteacher wanting to help his country. Matt Damon plays Private Ryan, the young soldier that Hanks and his crew have been sent to find. Beginning with one of the most memorable scenes in recent cinema and ending with one of the most sickeningly sentimental scenes, Private Ryan is an uneven work. What people like about this film is the simple message juxtaposed with, what I guess, brutal violence. Oliver Stone managed this better in Platoon (even the brilliant opening scene in Private Ryan does not compare to the scene in Platoon where the soldiers burn down the Vietnamese village).That said, SVP still features decent performances from Matt Damon and Tom Hanks with excellent support coming from Tom Sizemore and a surprisingly touching performance from Vin Diesel, in a small role as an Italian-American soldier. The direction is also solid as is the script. However mundanity and Spielberg's safety net, sentimentality frequently come into play making this a lesser entry in the war film and the Spielberg cannon."
brv,"Aug 12, 1998",2/10,"Spielberg just about had it here, at least for the first half hour or so. He looked at the bone-crunching, grisly history of D-day and had the movie to put it on the screen with some respect for honest reality. Then, with his Hollywood sellout lack of vision, Spielberg decided to throw it all away on patriotic fantasy. The 'true' story the film may be based on has some chaplain in France discovering Ryan after word was passed along that his brothers had all been lost and the lad should be shipped back to America so his mother still has one child to work the farm. Or, the story could be straight out of the writer's head but it hardly matters. The premise itself strikes the viewer as utterly ludicrous after a half-hour of complete slaughter, the seas red with human blood and gore. We are expected to believe that an army chief is sitting in his office and worrying over Private Ryan and his family while the assault on Normandy is costing thousands upon thousands of lives, while the allied bombers are missing their mark up and down the coast and Hitler's machine guns are just mowing down allies like grass. What romantic rubbish and so typical of Hollywood. And the portrayal of the German prisoner is morally offensive. The German people have never been less human than Americans, even when they were lead by an evil leader into a war.  To portray them as Spielberg does the prisoner, a bumbling idiot who later becomes a murdering snake, hissing shhh as he slowly sinks a huge knife into an American chest, is low-brow, hateful stuff. But nobody is going to notice. Believe me. In fact, we love to see the world in black and white, simplistic terms.  Here come the Oscars for Spielberg. Americans (and my own Canadians too) are generally not prepared to see the truth about themselves. Capital 'D' Denial reigns supreme, especially at the box-office. Spielberg's big budget is spent to further anesthetize us while claiming to be trying to do justice to the truth. If he'd stayed on the beach at Omaha, he'd have a nine out of ten. Instead, he rates several points less for this updated version of that old T.V. series called Combat. Please see Amy Taubin's review at the following URL. It's much more articulate and generous than mine.http://www.villagevoice.com/ink/film/30taubin.shtml"
colin-5,"Jul 29, 1998",N/A,"Its hard to understand how any person could have survived battles so superbly shown here;and this is the ultimate 'reality' film on war, horror, and courage ever made. Its message is so powerful all young folk should see it to understand how 'lucky' we the 'Allies' were to finally beat the Germans - we, the citizen soldiers so well shown, up against the terrifying enemy, who literally fought to the bitter end. The 'cost' is seen in the cemeteries in Europe & Asia; for me the US 8th AF near Cambridge, England; Normandy, France; and Rangoon, Burma are like this film, important and necessary reminders of how much I owe to so many to enjoy life here in the United States."
