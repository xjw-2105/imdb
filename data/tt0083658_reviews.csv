Sleepin_Dragon,"Jun 16, 2023",9/10,"In the future year of 2019, a group of four replicas arrive on Earth in search of their creator, Blade Runner Rick Deckard is persuaded into hunting them down.Love it or hate it, one thing that can't be questioned, is the amount of movies that this film inspired. Blade Runner was a ground breaking movie, one that was way ahead of its time.Blade Runner is up there with Dune for me as one of the greatest movies to come out of the 80's, I would definitely deem it as a classic, it's so watchable.The best element for me, the visuals, this is one the truly exquisite looking film, consider the era it was made in, and the lack of sophisticated special effects and tech, this is a triumph of creativity.I know pacing is an issue for some, and storytelling has changed with time, but the pace here is very deliberate, it develops and builds, it's there to give you a sense of unease. Don't expect action at every turn, that's not the purpose of the film.The music of Vangelis is terrific throughout, it adds to the film, and never imposes or tries to overtake.I always love seeing someone's vision of the future, and the future world is wonderfully imaginative and perfectly realised, though still wonderfully 1980's, so there's plenty of punk and glam, big hair, clear plastic jackets and eye shadow galore. One thing that was spot on, a greater coming together of cultures.A recent news article about AI made me think of this film, scientists are warning about the threat posed by AI development, after watching this film again, I can see where they're coming from.Harrison Ford is great, perfectly cast as Deckard, another of his iconic roles. Rutger Hauer also manages to captivate and terrify.This is a classic, quality movie.9/10."
gogoschka-1,"Feb 11, 2018",N/A,"A feast for the eyes. Dark and uncompromising. With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking megacity landscapes of future Los Angeles. Ridley Scott's adaptation of Philip K. Dick's post-apocalyptic bounty hunter story 'Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep' is a visionary work of art; it's a dystopian masterpiece and I'd personally call it as much a milestone of science fiction as Kubrick's '2001' (and be advised to watch the version known as the ""final cut"" if you want to catch 'Blade Runner' as it was intended by its director).It's hard to overstate how influential the film was; it invented the sci-fi subgenre now known as ""cyberpunk"", and it was also the first ""film noir"" in a sci-fi setting. And although it looks so distractingly gorgeous that even today there are people who still dismiss it as superficial and mere ""eye candy"", it is a philosphically deep film that ponders existential questions about the nature of being human. Its slow, brooding quality will perhaps leave some modern audiences who are used to a different pace and more action underwhelmed - but make no mistake: this is a groundbreaking masterwork of its genre and a timeles classic. 10 stars out of 10.Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/"
SantiagoDM1,"Aug 20, 2018",10/10,"Blade Runner describes a future in which, through genetics, artificial humans are manufactured and called ""replicants""; employees in dangerous jobs and slaves in the outer colonies of the Earth. Made by Tyrell Corporation under the motto ""more humans than humans"" -especially the ""Nexus-6"" models- not only resembles humans, they are far superior physically.The replicants were declared illegal on planet Earth after a bloody mutiny occurred on the planet Mars, where they worked as slaves. A special police force, Blade Runners, is in charge of identifying, tracking and killing - or ""withdrawing"", in terms of the police itself - the fugitive replicants found on Earth. With a group of replicants loose in Los Angeles, Rick Deckard, the best agent that has existed in regard to the recovery and removal of the replicas, is removed from his semi-retirement to use some of ""the old magic blade runner"".Ridley Scott fantastic dark cyberpunk style and futuristic design is so well made that accomplished to create a visual vocabulary: neon lights, abandonment, decay, loneliness, obscurity, indifference and alienation are the core of the aesthetics of the film, which will eventually become and serve as a pattern for successive cinematographic works.The script David Webb Peoples adapted from 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' takes the viewer into a dwelling and philosophical controversy, as it creates doubt and empathy to the so called replicants, primarily as seen in many shots of Rick Deckard hesitating about the true nature of his task.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer haunts the attention into the essence of the story. Their characterization throughout infiltrates the different conceptions of life. A saddened soul searching for the meaning of his punished existence and the other, ruminating a task sinking him into a moral void brimming with guilt.At the end, the movie leaves you wondering about the implications the creation of highly intelligent beings (IA) must have and, if it's worth treating them as machines or they have become so human that the difference is non existent.""Time... to die"".10/10."
snoozejonc,"Feb 18, 2021",10/10,"Rick Deckard is given an assignment to 'retire' several biologically engineered fugitives.The plot follows Deckard as he hunts replicants, falls in love and questions his own humanity. It moves slow, allowing you to take in all the sights and sounds of 2019 Los Angeles (as imagined in 1982), whilst pondering some of its themes.The imagery and dialogue associated with what defines a sentient being and what makes us human is compellingly portrayed. The device used to explore these themes is the genetically engineered humanoid life-form, the godlike status of its creator and the morally compromised nature of the ordinary human. Additionally the number of references to the eyes and linking of what we see and remember versus what is fake and reality, is cleverly mixed into the story. If you want in depth analysis, google 'Blade Runner Themes and Motifs'.The character of Roy Batty has been interpreted as both a religious and philosophical allegory, but these theories are debatable. He is for me the most intriguing character in the movie and his final scene is one of the most memorable of all time. Along with Deckard, it made me wonder if there is any real difference between humans and replicants. He is portrayed wonderfully by Rutger Hauer who both looks and acts the part.Deckard is impressively played by Harrison Ford, who is perfect for movies with an emphasis on visuals. Ninety percent of his power as an actor comes from his screen presence and soulful facial expressions. His scenes with Sean Young young are as touching as the action scenes are brutal.One of Blade Runner's most memorable aspects is its depiction of 2019 Los Angeles, with its permanently dark rainy skies, overcrowding, neon lights, high concept technology, urban decay and environmental devastation. Take away the flying cars and off-world colonies and it's not far off an accurate prediction.I could write about the atmospheric cinematography, artistic designs and special effects, but nothing I can say would do it justice.The question of whether Deckard is replicant or human is interesting. There is evidence of both but you must watch and decide. Does it matter? Probably not. If I had to decide, I'd say replicant."
muckenschnabli,"May 10, 2020",10/10,Just my personal opinion. Everything is perfect about this movie. I saw the movie the first time when I was 12 and it was mind blowing for me. 38 years later I feel the same about this movie. Timeless and beautiful. For me 10/10 with a star and smile
Flagrant-Baronessa,"Jul 25, 2006",10/10,"Dark, deep, uncertain, unsettling  imagine the most beautiful nightmare you've ever had  this is Blade Runner (1982).Ridley Scott's Blade Runner is a brilliantly crafted science fiction film that not only touches upon, but bravely plunges into deep philosophical questions, making it simply ten times more important than any film of its genre. I love it not only for the initial feeling it gives, but because of its perseverance  none of the visuals, themes or technology feel dated but as deep, gripping and current as ever. It is timeless beauty with huge doses of emotion.Set in 2019 Los Angeles, Blade Runner zooms in on the eerily-lit, urban streets of the city and follows Richard Deckard  superbly played by Harrison Ford who brings an exquisite moral ambiguity to his character  a special policeman who tracks down and terminates artificially-created humans called replicants, who have escaped from an Off-World colony and made their way to earth and need to be stopped. The things Deckard encounters on his detective journey raise many philosophical questions like: Who is really a replicant? Are replicants really bad? If replicants are bad, when why did we go to such lengths with our technology to create them? Are replicants really humans? Is Deckard a hero? This truly is a film that demands subsequent discussion and its ambiguous ending leave a haunting and eerie feeling.In spite of a rich glaze of science fiction and futurism coating this adventure, there are distinct film noir elements present  primarily in the bluish haze that the film is seen through and its gritty urban atmosphere. Whoever thought of this combination is a genius. Since it is all about technology, it fits then that Blade Runner features a ridiculous amount of product placement, especially from Atari. In any other film, this would have felt out-of-place but here it is simply perfect. The score by Vangelis is strangely gripping when combined with the striking cinematography of the film.Blade Runner deserves credit, celebration and remembrance for it is simply an excellent film.10 out of 10 (and I don't just throw this grade out like SOME people)"
joelhoff,"Mar 5, 2002",10/10,"This is truly one of the greatest science fiction films ever made, one that requires a thinking viewer in order to understand and appreciate it.  The director's cut is the recommended one to see as it omits a somewhat distracting narration and avoids an unnecessary Hollywood-style ending that is at odds with the rest of the film's tone.A true science fiction story or film is about ideas, not spaceship battles, futuristic gadgets, or weird creatures.  ""Blade Runner"" fully qualifies as this in its examination of the impact of technology on human society, existence, and the very nature of humanity itself.  These themes are set in a fairly basic detective story that moves slowly but gradually builds power as the viewer is immersed in a dystopian futuristic Los Angeles.Harrison Ford fans accustomed to the normally dynamic roles that he plays may be dissatisfied with the seemingly lifeless lead character that he portrays here as the replicant-hunting detective known as a ""blade runner"". They should be, for this dissatisfaction is part of the film experience, part of the dehumanized existence in the story's setting.  However, as the story unfolds, we see Ford's character, Rick Deckard, slowly come alive again and recover some humanity while pursing four escaped replicants.The replicants, genetically-engineered human cyborgs, that Deckard must hunt down and kill are in many ways more alive than Deckard himself initially. Their escape from an off-world colony has an explicit self-directed purpose, whereas Deckard's life appears to have none other than his job, one that he has tried to give up.  By some standards, Deckard and the replicants have thin character development.  However, this is a deeply thematic and philosophical film, and as such the characters are the tools of the story's themes.  Each character reflects some aspect of humanity or human existence, but they lack others, for each is broken in ways that reflect the broken society in which they live and were conceived/created.There are several dramatic moments involving life-and-death struggles, but most of these are more subdued than in a normal detective story plot.  The film's power is chiefly derived through its stunning visual imagery of a dark futuristic cityscape and its philosophical themes.Among the themes explored are the following: - The dehumanization of people through a society shaped by technological and capitalistic excess. - The roles of creator and creation, their mutual enslavement, and their role reversal, i.e., the creation's triumph over its creator. - The nature of humanity itself: emotions, memory, purpose, desire, cruelty, technological mastery of environment and universe, mortality, death, and more. - Personal identity and self-awareness. - The meaning of existence.If you are not someone who naturally enjoys contemplating such themes, the film's brilliance may be lost on you.  The climax involves a soliloquy that brings many of the themes together in a simple yet wonderfully poetic way. Anyone who ""gets"" the film should be moved by this; others will sadly miss the point and may prefer watching some mindless action flick instead.""Blade Runner"" is a masterpiece that deserves recognition and long remembrance in film history."
fryguy-88668,"Feb 28, 2022",6/10,"I know it is blasphemy to many, but I didn't love this movie. Somewhat groundbreaking in its use of actual darkness to impart the bleak tone. I'm a fan of Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott. The supporting cast is solid. It's just a bit boring at times."
marntfield,"Jul 14, 2005",9/10,"What can be said about this film that hasn't already been covered in preceding decennia? Blade Runner (either version) stands the test of time as an epic story which transcends a disparity of genres, as well as the seminal ""dark"" sci-fi film which has been mimicked so frequently (to varying degrees of success) since its original release. The interplay of film noir, sci-fi, and what is one of the most philosophically symbolic and academically analyzed narratives of the modern era holds its ground on both visual and cerebral levels even in the face of today's CGI laden blockbusters. The new director's cut, contrary to many cinematic re-hashings, actually serves to clarify many of the more nebulous aspects of the plot and makes a great film even better, arguably allowing it to be modernized and polished for a new generation of viewers who are more picky and yet simultaneously less idealistic. All while sustaining the feeling and flavor of the original. Call it restorative work if you will. The tinny and meandering score by Vangelis is pure 1980s at its most brooding and fits the texture and mood of the film beautifully. Indeed, for many reasons, finding this film in someone's DVD collection makes a true statement about their discriminating and refined taste in movies, and equally their appreciation of film as an artistic medium. I would suggest picking up a reader by someone like Nietzsche, Foucualt, Descartes, Kierkegaard, or any of the great existentialist philosophers after viewing this film in order to appreciate the story & its concepts at a whole new level, regardless if you're watching it for either the 1st, or the 100th time. An enduring classic and an intrepid piece of film-making with rich & often haunting visuals designed to entertain and promote introspection amongst its viewers. 9/10."
casstevens-43612,"Jul 9, 2021",6/10,"First of all, I REALLY want to like this movie since I love sci-fi movies. I first saw it in december last year and the movie left me very disappointed. I just rewatched it, hoping that I missed something the first time I watched it, but it didnt get any better on rewatch. I'll start with a positive note ; Everything in this film looks absolutely fantastic. For design and production it gets a 10/10. But asside from that, the movie gives me pretty much nothing else to enjoy. The plot was uninteresting and the pacing was too slow. Besides Rutger Hauers character, all the other characters in this movie were among the most boring and monotone I have ever seen, which makes me not care about any of them. All that happened in the movie was basically just Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer going from place to place to interrogate people and kill them. I still rate it 6/10 because the design kept me sort of entertained and the final battle was ok I guess. It may sound very controversial but Blade Runner 2049 is a much better movie."
jacobsearcy-30947,"Apr 1, 2020",4/10,"I made an Imdb account just to leave this review. I was so excited to watch what I've heard many refer to as ""the greatest sci-fi film ever made"". The only thing keeping this from a 1/10 is the visuals. The atmosphere is great, dystopian Los Angeles reminds me of a vivid terrifying nightmare-scape. Besides that, this is one of the most flat and empty movies I've ever seen. The pacing is never more than a crawl, we are given no reason to care about the characters, and it has the worst quality a film can have: it bored me to tears. A statement could be made that it is not great for its entertainment value, but more so for its philosophical commentary on the future of machines and AI, but the film did an awful job at that as well! I haven't the slightest idea what I'm supposed to have taken from this film.
If one enjoys this for the nostalgia factor, go ahead, but if you're new to sci-fi, do not watch thisToo Long Didn't Read: Great visuals, dull and uninteresting script and characters will bore you to tears. Perhaps the most overrated film in sci-fi history, proceed with caution."
jaywolfenstien,"Feb 2, 2008",N/A,"I spent a weekend with the new DVD set of Blade Runner. Watched all four versions pretty much back to back (minus the work print version) starting with the US theatrical and finishing with the Final Cut. And across those eight hours I spent with the film, I did not get tired of watching – just watching – that futuristic film-noir vibe: deep dark shadows and majestic use of light and color used to make a run-down polluted cityscape look so beautiful. In fact, when I got to the Final Cut, which had been cleaned up, restored, and remixed, the picture and sound quite literally took my breath away.Blade Runner is easily one of the best looking films ever made.In some ways, many ways, Blade Runner strikes me as silly. Particularly in its more climactic moments where the protagonist faces off against a replicant. Pris's acrobatic means of attacking Deckard? When Roy Batty chases Deckard in his shorts (when a few moments before he was fully clothed?) The film goes over-the-top to the point where I find myself asking, ""why in the world would the characters do that?!"" But here's what's interesting: as silly as Blade Runner may get it never betrays its own world. Everything that happens, in some queer way, feels natural to this strange futuristic world.I like the movie in its action scenes, but I simply adore it during the quieter moments – the parts where not a whole hell of a lot is happening, and you can simply watch and absorb Jordan Cronenweth's marvelous cinematography. My favorite scene comes when Rachel has saved Deckard's life. An emotional wreck of killing another replicant on top of the revelation that she, herself, is a replicant – she stands by a window where light floods in, so much light that the whole screen goes white, and then it recedes again and we see the characters again. Later in that same scene, she sits at the piano, plays for a bit, and then lets her hair down. Hearing Deckard stumbling in the other room, she looks out of the corner of her eye  and shot after shot after shot through this entire sequence demonstrates absolute mastery over the frame.Plus some of the other quiet moments resonate with a truer low-key science-fiction feel such as the scene in Tyrell corporation where Deckard applies the Voight-Kampff test to Rachel. More or less a mundane questionaire/interview with a typical sci-fi gadget sitting on the table, but Ridley Scott and Terry Rawlings compacts the lengthy endeavor into a few short moments using a stunningly simple montage.Later on, Deckard sits in front of a voice-activated screen analyzing a photograph. The task is presented as a dull monotonous job (made especially evident in Harrison Ford's delivery), yet the scene, itself, never bores. The voice-activation not only serves as a staple sci-fi device, but cleverly allows Deckard to take the audience's hand and guide them through this investigative process. And perhaps what I like most about the scene: the audience, and even Deckard himself, doesn't even really know what he's found. Things don't magically fall into place with a Scooby-Doo moment of revelation. He finds another clue that might lead somewhere (albeit, since it's a movie it's a good guess the clue does lead somewhere.) In my mind at least moments such as the Voight-Kampff scenes, Deckard's briefing, the photograph analysis, both of Rachel's scenes in Deckard's apartment gives the world of Blade Runner a solid grounding so later on it can get away with the absurd.Which brings me to the replicants. Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) in particular, whose strangely sympathetic in that his murderous tendencies spawn directly from his fear of dying. This is a man who possesses a strong conviction that he deserves life perhaps because he looks around on earth and sees people squandering their existence while he knows he only has a few short moments. Why should a shmuck like Deckard live for 50+ years when Roy in his 4 short years has seen attack ships burning off the shoulder of Orion and seen C-beams glitter in the dark  ""If only you could see what I've seen with your eyes,"" he proudly and warmly tells one of the scientists who helped create him.As for which cut of the film, I don't think any single one is perfect (and I'd honestly watch any of them in a heartbeat.) I prefer the ""Final Cut"" over the others and admire Ridley Scott's restraint in his definitive DVD release. Most of the modifications are fine-tuning tweaks the casual viewer won't even notice unless watching two version back to back, and most of said fine-tuning improve the film (although, admittingly, Roy's beckoning of Sebastian could've been left out.) But hell, all versions of Blade Runner are included, so people don't have much room to complain about the changes. And no matter what version you go with, it's still a beautiful film to just  watch."
cp_spandex,"Feb 10, 2007",10/10,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue.Finally, visually, this movie is quite simply a science fiction triumph. It looks better than modern computer effects in every way that counts. Superimposed special effect objects don't give off that unnatural, clearly computer-generated ""Lord of the Rings"" sheen common in today's effects-driven blockbusters. This, of course, is because Blade Runner - while a gorgeous movie - is not effects driven in the least. Rather, it is a visually driven story that doesn't rely on special effects. This is an important distinction to make in today's Hollywood.""Touch of Evil"" really wasn't the last of the Great Film Noirs!"
NikosMarkant,"Mar 25, 2018",10/10,"Blade Runner is perhaps the best sci-fi film and undoubtedly one of the best films of all time. Along with 2001: A Space Odyssey, it is one of the most philosophical and influential movies ever created, as it conveys a plethora of fundamental questions, which are woven in the very fabric of the human essence and existence. It seems near impossible to imagine a more suitable fusion of two of the most successful genres of all time, Science Fiction and Film Noir. By merging together the moral conflict and the emphatic character arc of the private detective, a trait that is exclusive to and definitive of the Film Noir genre, with a futuristic dystopian environment, Blade Runner creates the ultimate Neo-Noir setting, the only one capable of supporting such strong ideas and posing such significant questions to the viewer, without compromising on an interesting plot development and an appealing pace, things that are masterfully achieved via a tight script and persuasive performances.In a dark, future dystopian portrait of a 2019 Los Angeles, where humans have alienated themselves with their true nature and claimed the title of god/creator of life, effectively manufacturing artificial intelligence and bioengineering androids, called ""Replicants"", a retired ""Blade Runner"" named Rick Deckard is assigned with the undertaking of terminating four rogue such replicants that have illegally returned to Earth in a quest to force their maker, Tyrel, into postponing their grim destiny, basically prolonging their already predetermined four-year lifespan. Their greatest sin, however, is having the audacity of desiring one of the most sought-after values in the history of the human species, the freedom to live as they please. In this uneasy and twisted world, the lines between humanness and machinery are blurred and Deckard is faced with the consequences of the realization that not all is as it seems and there is more to ""being-alive"" than most believe.Blade Runner's unique depiction of the future has been imitated numerous times quite unsuccessfully, mostly due to the fact that no other film to this date has managed to create such an engaging atmosphere so beautifully connected to every part of it, effectively enhancing every scene and allowing for a strong conveyance of all the moral and existential questions that are posed during the whole duration. The audience is instantaneously absorbed by the vivid and compelling world depicted in the film, and that's where Ridley Scott succeeds the most, offering a glance into an original and somewhat disturbing reality that might very well be humanity's near future. The cinematography is impeccable, the art direction is gorgeous and along with some of the best visual effects that have ever been used in film-making, creates one of the most realistic and visually stunning environments that have ever graced a motion picture to this day. Vangelis has also composed one of the best and most awe-inspiring scores of all time, effectively managing to capture the very essence of each scene, thus making all sound a significant and inseparable part of the whole cinematic experience that Blade Runner has to offer.This thorough examination of what it means to be human isn't, thankfully, to no avail, as a careful observant, is forced to question their beliefs and attempt to choose a side on dilemmas that are still discussed by philosophers to this day, such as the traits that define humanity, the relativity that characterizes concepts like right or wrong, good or evil, as well as the meaning of life itself. The moral and existential complexity of this reality that Blade Runner has offered to the world reaches depths unparalleled by the majority of the films available, therefore greatly distinguishing it from all others and thus emphasizing its uniqueness through the most complete portrayal of science fiction to date."
krishnaraj613,"Jul 9, 2005",10/10,"I have an interest in science fiction films and TV programmes. I like shows like (the original) Star Wars trilogy, (most of) the Star Trek films, as well as Star Trek TV series (Voyager for modern times,preferably, as it had the least number of useless episodes), etc. In my experience, most SF material turns out to be distilled garbage. Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' was a masterpiece. I am not hesitant to say that I blatantly dislike Spielberg's definition of SF- ET, Close Encounters, & (worst of all) War Of The Worlds. Neither do I appreciate any 'Alien' film apart from R Scott's 1979 original (although Alien2 was OK)-Alien vs Pred is a disgrace not only to all genres, but to the film industry itself. So when I heard of Blade Runner on the net, I wondered; what could be so good about this film? I have HBO,Cinemax, Star Movies- yet this film has never been shown. So, I got myself the Director's Cut at the local video store. I watched it once. Then I re-watched it two days later. My verdict: This film is fantastic.It is one of the greatest films ever made, on par with 2001: A Space Odyssey. Upon 1st viewing, new audiences may be bewildered. One anticipates a futuristic run-of-the-mill 80's shoot-em-up (in the like of Outland,say). What you get is a film so deep that it is difficult to grasp the 1st time. There is so much symbolism, introverts and questions that I was left stunned. The film is hauntingly beautiful, and I doubt that these screen landscapes could be reproduced today as well as they were here. The plot centres around the question of humanity- something we take for granted. It is not an auctioneer, which was probably what audiences expected when they walked into theatres in the 80s, causing the film to fail commercially. Blade Runner is not for the adrenaline junkie, nor for those who like flashy gadgets and bright explosions, with a healthy Hollywood-made dose of convincing storyline spoon-fed for their satisfaction.The film is set in the apocalyptic, suggestively post-war future Earth, where there seems to be a lag in technology. Perhaps there was a war which ravaged the world, forcing humans to migrate (the cramped cultural richness of LA), and rebuild, explaining the retro technology. 6 'Criminal' Nexus 6 replicates (genetically engineered humanoids), hijack a ship and come to Earth seeking their maker. These slaves(machines/automatons// regard them as anything which has been created by Man to lessen his burden) have developed emotions, and they fear death for they cherish their memories (Think robots weeping over photographs). Their cause: They want a longer life, they want to experience more, they want to be... human.Enter Rick Deckard, Blade Runner. His job: kill trespassing replicates; Kill living, breathing humanoids composed of flesh and blood who only have 4 years to live out their miserable lives, seeking haven on Earth rather than serving as slaves in mining outposts on Mars. Kill? Murder seems more appropriate. But that's his job. replicates which trespass are a hazard. These 6 replicates have killed 23 people and hijacked a ship. They have to be killed, right? If you're planning to take sides in this film, you will be pleasantly if not unnervingly surprised. There are no sides. There is no good and evil. Harrison Ford plays the reluctant, burned out Blade Runner very well. His character is drab and dull, as it was meant to be; look at him in the Spinner on the way to Tyrell corporation- pure boredom. He hates his job. If there were any narration, it Should sound dull and uninteresting, reflecting his character. Rutger Hauer gives the greatest performance of his career (so far) in this film, playing Roy Batty, Replicant 'project manager'. He dominates the later part of the film. He is cold, stiff and evil, but in the end speech, one of the Greatest endings I have ever seen, his performance alone makes this film a Classic. The ending is beautiful, and the score by Vangelis is perfect.All in all, the film is excellent. Well directed by Ridley Scott, innovative and stunning imagery underlined by Vangelis' superb score, and plenty to think about (on your own- no spoon feeding). Check out the trivia for this film; scientists voted it better than 2001:A Space Odyssey. Is the quest for humanity a crime? Find out for yourself. Blade Runner is a Must-Watch, and a Must-Have film.My rating: 8.9 / 10 Thank you for your time. Kris"
TheLittleSongbird,"Jan 1, 2011",10/10,"Blade Runner is quite simply wonderful, and not only is it one of Ridley Scott's best films, but also one of the best of the genre. For one thing, the visuals are superb. Not just in the special effects which are just mind-blowing but also in the cinematography, colours and sets. Another strong asset is the score, in fact Blade Runner is easily one of Vangelis's best by how mysterious and haunting it all is.The story is just great. True, it is the sort of film you need to see more than once to understand/appreciate it, but that is not a flaw in any way, quite the contrary. The story is very compelling, and also very deep thematically. Blade Runner is further advantaged by memorable dialogue, superb direction by Scott and good pacing. I can understand why some are underwhelmed by the ending, I was at first, but the more I saw the film the more the ending made sense to me. Finally the performances. Harrison Ford is perfectly cast, and Sean Young supports him admirably, but the real star of the cast is Rutgar Hauer who is outstanding in his role.In conclusion, a brilliant film and something Scott should be proud of. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
stephen_eastwood,"Apr 25, 2021",6/10,Don't understand why this film has such a high rating. I mean it's ok but nothing special. I get that it would have looked great at a cinema in the 1980s but the plot and characterisation are pretty weak.
ccthemovieman-1,"Dec 7, 2008",9/10,"Sometimes you just need to give a film a second chance, even if it is 20 years later! Only some rave reviews about the picture quality of this new 5-disc ""Complete Collector's Edition"" enticed me to watch this again. Wow, I am glad; this was a very entertaining and a tremendous visual and audio treat.I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder.""Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art.Scott says this is the best version and the best his film has ever looked and sounded. Since it's his movie, who am I to argue. So, if you're like me and never gave this movie a chance (I lost interest halfway through with my VHS look at it), give this a second look on this Blu-Ray edition....and you will be blown away. This is, indeed, an amazing film."
Andy_M_IMDB,"May 16, 2020",6/10,"This movie is undoubtedly a timeless classic, visually appealing with dark twists and turns that make for some great atmospherics. But the plot does seem to take a backseat at times to the, at the time, superb special effects. The very human thoughts and feelings of the ""replicants"" makes for some emotional viewing, crowned by the ""tears in rain"" monologue by Rutger Hauer. What really lets the movie down is the pace. The story crawls along so slowly that at times makes you think ""I've got to finish watching, it's a classic movie"", rather than wanting to watch based on its own merits."
jfitch7,"Mar 6, 2001",N/A,"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott and based on Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, is a Sci-fi slash Noir film about a cop named Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) in a decrepit 2019 Los Angeles whose job it is to ""retire"" four genetically engineered syborgues, known as ""Replicants"".  The four fugitives, Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), Leon (Brion James), and their leader, Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), have escaped from an off-world colony in order to find their creator and bully him into expanding their pre-determined four year life span.  This film originally flopped when it came out in 1982, but since has become a widely acclaimed cult classic with a director's cut to boot.  A large part of the success that this movie has received can be attributed to its ability to operate on many different levels.Ridley Scott's hauntingly possible depiction of what might become of Los Angeles down the line is absolutely brilliant.  It captures elements of Noir with its urban atmosphere of decadence, lighting, and characters neither clearly defined as good nor evil.  Corruption is everywhere.  The garbage-littered streets and permanence of dark and rain give us the sense that we've seriously screwed up the atmosphere, and the impression that all respectable human beings have fled to the off-world colonies, leaving only the scum of the earth behind.There is a hint of style from the 40's, especially with respect to cars, costumes, and music.  Rachael's entire outfit, including her hair, screams the 40's.The soundtrack, arranged by Vangelis (who won an Oscar for his Chariots of Fire score), consisted mainly of Jazz and Blues.  This functioned to represent a dark, moody world of uncertainty and pessimism.The special effects were exceptional.  Much of the set was pulled off using models.  In my opinion, sets made by hand require leagues more of skill and are much more impressive and realistic than those computer generated.  These guys really knew what they were doing.  I was especially fond of the pyramidesque Tyrell Corporation building, which hinted at the god-like presence of Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkell), the creator.The script (Hampton Fancher, David Peoples, and of course Phil Dick) worked for me, as well as the actors who gave voice to it.  Harrison Ford was well...Harrison Ford.  I thought he did a tremendous job down-playing the role.  His voice-over narration helped you along, and was yet another feature conducive to Film Noir (apparently this was taken out of the Director's Cut).  Rutger Hauer's performance was intense.  His lines at the end were intriguingly philosophical.  Daryl Hannah's chilling robotic expressions were quite impressive.  Joanna Cassidy was just plain hot.There is more to this film than just pulp.  It works on so many remarkable levels.  The movie itself is a detective noir quest for the meaning of life in a science fiction environment, but the story is a commentary on what it means to be human and the questions each one of us have about life, like: How long have I to live?  Why do I have to die?  What happens when I die? Doesn't my maker care?  Is this all merely an illusion?  At the end of the film we are left to wonder if these Replicants are human, and if Deckard himself is in fact a Replicant.  Scott raises more questions here than he answers, and as a result, critics are still debating the mysteries of this film today.  In a sense, the ambiguity of Blade Runner is the culprit of its success."
Gizzi,"Sep 7, 1998",10/10,"I saw this movie somewhere in the early 90s when I studied at school. Those were times when former USSR still existed and it was very hard to find any information about movies or actors. This movie was showed on some TV channel with bad quality and offscreen translator snuffled. I didn't know the names of actors and even missed the movie's title but I could not forget the movie and a face of the main replicant. This face haunted me. Only in 1994 I suddenly saw it again in a paper and found out that it was Rutger Hauer. He became my favourite actor. Maybe it's his only movie where the depth of his talent met the equal depth of a movie itself. Also I don't remember any other movie in which almost all episodic or secondary characters have such a memorable appearance. None the worse is the soundtrack written by Vangelis, but the great discovery for me was to hear the whole album ""Blade runner. The original movie soundtrack"" which I regard as one of the best album in the discography of Vangelis."
Jenniferquaterman7,"Apr 2, 2023",8/10,"This is one of the very few movies that gets better the more often you see it. It is a subtle movie. Slowly but surely this one has made it into the top 5 of my 'best movies of all time' list.I don't particularly care for the director's cut version, though. The inner monologue is missing - which gives you some of the most thought inspiring moments, and some of the added scenes downright make no sense at all. If I'd seen that one first I might never have given it a second chance.The cast is exceptional. Every one of them does a really fine job. Especially Rutger Hauer who otherwise has very few good movies to his name (maybe 'Day of the Falcon') delivers a stunning performance. Most of the cast who were unknown before this movie have moved on to fame (and some to fortune) - and rightfully so.From a technical point of view there is not much to criticize. More than 20 years later this movie still doesn't look dated (apart from 'Atari'-neon signs). The atmosphere is created with a lot of attention to detail, and the models of buildings are some of the most beautiful and believable ones I have ever seen.Now I recently read the book on which it is based ('Do androids dream of electric sheep' by Philip K. Dick). It's a quirky read and, frankly, not a very good book. It has too many plot holes, deus-ex-machina devices and logical inconsistencies, plus a total letdown of an ending. What it does add to the movie is the setup of why the atmosphere is like it is (polluted, dark, many 'freaks' around), and the nice question whether the Hero might be a replicant himself."
perica-43151,"Jul 20, 2018",10/10,"Perhaps the best sci fi movie ever made, this cult classic was underappreciated at its time. This only shows how shortsighted critics and American public can be. This movie is perfect in many ways, is prophetic, well made, and if not the best movie ever made is close to that, certainly in the sci fi genre."
chaswe-28402,"Sep 9, 2017",10/10,"Several years ago I may have read the original story, but don't remember it; and it doesn't matter. The same bleakly powerful message probably pervades both book and picture. The fact is, we are all replicants. The bitter truth is, we have no purpose, except to reproduce ourselves. Whether our life-span last 4, 40 or 140 years, it is as purposeless and pointless as if we were androids. Which we are. It doesn't matter what we have seen or experienced. We will pass and be forgotten, like the rest. It has been noticed that this film contains no families, or children. The need for that traditional, outdated method of self-replication has been eliminated, and people are simply duplicated, in different models, with variations. Memories are routinely fed into replicants, to convince them that they have reality, however spurious. If there ever was a creator, he was definitely killed, for his presumption. There is no doubt that, like everyone else, Deckard is a replicant. The film is frighteningly and permanently effective, for anyone who thinks about it, in every way. It's an image of our actual lives, here and now.Everything about Blade Runner is absolutely fabulous. It soars where the clunky and semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles.Now that I've read the book, and watched ""Dangerous Days"", I learn that Tyrell, the supposed creator, was merely another replicant, which simply confirms what I already believed.The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental, matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning."
exterminator_99,"Jan 24, 2001",7/10,"Blade Runner has become a cult hit in the 19 years since its release.  It is understandable why.  The film has a disjointed, postmodern narrative surrounded by superb photography and set design.  The hero is not even a hero and the conclusion of the film, at least the director's cut, isn't all that happy.  Most of all, Blade Runner eerily shadows the near future for our own world, the future of cloning and unnaturally created humans. Science fiction has always been able to show us images of ourselves or our world in a future or alien world, things we would prefer not to see.Blade Runner's premise is simple.  Deckard (Harrison Ford) has to hunt down four Replicants': artificial humans who have great intelligence but superior physical attributes.  These replicants have run amock in space colonies and now human authorities on Earth are worried that the replicants will do the same here.All of this is really nothing more than a faint attempt at a story.  Blade Runner's success lies not with its story element, but with the amazing vision of fantasy and fear of its director, Ridley Scott.  Scott had previously made ""Alien"", another postmodern vision of man's possible future. In that film he questioned colonisation, globalization (but on a intergalactic scale), our fascination with destriction and the corruption of modern business.  In ""Blade Runner"", Scott explores corruption, man's destructive nature, but he also delves into emotion and the possibility of someone ELSE creating those emotions for us, as is the case for the replicants.The plot plays second fiddle to the set design and costumes.  The choice of Los Angeles being the setting for the film is brilliant: at present L.A. is a city blanketed in sunshine, with an image of blonde babes and surfers all too obvious.  In ""Blade Runner"" the city is nothing like it is today.  It has become a blend of Tokyo, New York and some Eastern European wasteland of pollution.The vehicle, weapons and costumes all have a distinctive 1980's - apocalyptic - retro feel to them, the flying cars are almost too cheesy to be taken seriously, but combined with Vangelis' synthesizer score and the noir-ish feel of the narrative they fit just perfectly.""Blade Runner""'s narrative is just that: film noir.  Deckard is akin to Sam Spade, he's seen it all, been there and back, and is a tortured soul.  It's got the femme fatale, the more evil than evil villan and the corporation that is somehow responsible for all this mess.  At the same time the film is a thriller, a western and a science fiction yarn.Harrison Ford is suited as Deckard.  He is the anti-Han Solo or Indiana Jones.  Rutger Hauer is superbly evil too, it is a shame he hasn't been able to follow this up with anything as good.Many films since this have tried to show a world void of any semblances of what we take for granted today, but none have compared to ""Blade Runner"". The film that came closest to it would be the Japanese animation ""Akira"" which also deals with similar themes.Science fiction always succeeds when the viewer is planted in the story one step beyond what might have actually happened.  See Planet of the Apes, Alien, Star Wars, et al.  In ""Blade Runner"" we get a vision of the world as it may actually be one day.  Maybe not 2019, but somewhere down the track the science fiction of films such as these may become science fact.""Blade Runner"" is one of THE definitive sci-fi movies ever made."
Hannibal_Chigurh,"Feb 2, 2008",10/10,"I had seen the Director's Cut (a misleading title) of Blade Runner and was slightly underwhelmed. I mean, sure it looked great, but the supposedly deep story just didn't grab me. Then I got the five disc briefcase for Christmas and immediately put in the Final Cut. Wow. It's all clear now.Blade Runner is one of a precious few pantheon of science fiction film that has become even more prescient as time passes (the other that comes to mind is 2001: A Space Odyssey). Look at the L.A. in this film, then look at present-day Los Angeles. Subtract the flying cars and robots and you've got the same city (horribly polluted and overpopulated with many ethnicities mixing language and cultures). We follow Deckard, a specialized cop known as a Blade Runner who hunts down androids known as replicants. These machines look like humans and, if given time to mature, emote like humans. They are used as labor and sex slaves, but die out after a 4 year period so their emotions do not develop (this too has ties to the modern world. Planned obsolescence is the reason your electronics never last more than a year or two). When a replicant starts to piece things together before it dies, Deckard must take it out before it harms humans.As the film progresses, we can see that Deckard doesn't particularly like his job despite the fact that he is the best Blade Runner in town. The replicant Rachael (played by Sean Young) seems to trigger a re-evaluation of his life, and he takes no pleasure in hunting the group of dangerous androids he's been hired to ""retire"".This film is Sir Ridley Scott's masterpiece, and the one that best shows his talents. Like his idol Kubrick, Scott knows how to light a scene just the right way, and his use of smoke and blinds and fans and anything else that distorts light is what gives the film its noir feel. He drops clues all along the way to that paramount of questions: Is Deckard a replicant? Every clue can be construed to fit either side of the debate, and it proves that there is no wrong answer to the question.The Final Cut essentially omits and touches up more than it adds. Most ""director's cuts"" are excuses to throw in material that was cut for a reason (and a good deal of them are done without the director's consent). Here, Scott digitally touches up a few technical flaws, but he doesn't go crazy like Lucas. Also, we get the complete unicorn scene, which is crucial to the film's big question, as well as sticking with the DC's omitted voice-over narration (which is such a blessing, by the way).In the end Blade Runner is a masterful look at that which makes us human. Roy Batty's final act gives us all the insight into replicants we need and his final speech is perhaps the single most moving moment in science fiction. It serves to underscore the whole film, and it sends chills down my spine every time I see it. Blade Runner is one of those precious sci-fi films that actually challenges you to think, and it almost single-handedly founded the film genre of cyberpunk, which had been present in literature but hadn't crossed over. Cyberpunk is unquestionably the most thought-provoking sub-genre of science fiction, and this film is its masterpiece. Many people award a film they like a perfect 10, but this is truly a cornerstone that has influenced directors, actors, and entire genres of film."
p_bourha,"Apr 11, 2023",7/10,"I thought Blade Runner was a groundbreaking film when it was first released 41 years ago, and it still holds relevance today. Despite the fact that the graphics and pace of modern films have advanced significantly, the unique aesthetic of Blade Runner, which blends film noir with science fiction, is still impressive. That being said, I did have some issues with the film. The transitions between scenes were sometimes awkward, and I felt that the character development could have been handled better. Some character choices felt out of place, and it was hard to understand their motivations. Additionally, some of the content in the film, particularly the relationship between Deckard and Rachael, felt problematic by today's standards.That being said, what I enjoyed most about Blade Runner were the philosophical and existential questions it raised. The film made me think about the nature of memory, identity, and the ethics of creating and controlling artificial life forms. The replicants' struggle for autonomy and their eventual demise was particularly thought-provoking. My favorite moment in the film was when Roy saved Deckard's life, which highlighted the complexity of the replicants' emotions and their capacity for compassion.Overall, while Blade Runner may not be perfect, its themes and questions remain relevant and make it worth watching, especially for those who appreciate science fiction and philosophical musings."
zkonedog,"Aug 3, 2017",4/10,"A number of years ago (when I was probably too young to be watching it in the first place), I watched ""Blade Runner"" and was utterly confused and disappointed by the whole thing. Cut to the present and now perhaps my favorite film director, Denis Villeneuve, is making ""Blade Runner 2049"" for release this fall. As such, I gave the original ""Blade Runner"" another chance to see if I was perhaps ""missing something"" (it seems to be widely considered one of the best sci-fi flicks ever). While I now understand what the movie is ""supposed to be"", so to speak, I can also better articulate why it won't appeal to a certain viewing audience.For a basic plot summary, ""Blade Runner"" is set in 2019 Los Angeles, where the Tyrell (Joe Turkel) Corporation has begun making human replicant (or ""skin jobs"") cybernetic beings for slave labor in the ""Off-World"" colonies. Predictably, a group of these beings, led by Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer), rebel and commandeer a vessel back to Earth, where they will wreak havoc if not dealt with. This is where Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) comes in, as he is the best in the business at dealing with these replicants. Along the way, Deckard comes across a new type of replicant, Rachael (Sean Young), that challenges him in ways not previously seen.There is no doubt that ""Blade Runner"" is based on a very interesting, pure science fiction concept: human consciousness in a machine body. There are thousands of stories that could be told on this topic, and many already have been across cinema. The trouble with ""Blade Runner"", though, is that it doesn't care all that much in digging into the meat-and-potatoes of those stories.Instead, this is a film primarily concocted out of love of noir and setting. Director Ridley Scott (much like he did in his earlier ""Alien"" effort) is vastly more interested in exploring the dark underbelly of a future LA than he is in crafting a really tight story. As such, much of ""Blade Runner"" showcases the aesthetics of the landscape. If you are really into that sort of thing, this movie will rocket up your list.For those more pulled in by story and character development, however, ""Blade Runner"" only gives out as many nuggets as it needs to in his department. In fact, most of the context of the entire picture is given in an opening text crawl. There are a few ""story moments"" scattered throughout the movie, but they are truly few and far between and too short to satisfy those looking for them.So, I think the litmus test of whether a viewer will enjoy ""Blade Runner"" comes down to how much you enjoy the noir/aesthetic of a film, as that is the film's primary purpose. Does it touch on some interesting ideas/characters? Yes. Does it explore them in any deeper fashion? Absolutely not."
Videot-3,"Dec 7, 1998",N/A,"OK, I admit...the first time I watched this movie I detested it. But hey, I was 16 years old and had expected an action-packed sci-fi adventure. Blade Runner is not such a film. But I am grateful for this, for after maturing a bit and rewatching the movie a couple of times, I discovered its greatness. It is not a traditional sci-fi movie, it's a touching drama about the value of life and the importance of making the most of what you've got. One of the most important themes in the film is the question of what is more valuable - humans without emotions, or machines with? The film gives no answer - it just opens our eyes and makes us aware that we should be grateful for being alive.Some people prefer the Director's Cut, but I like the original version better - mostly because of the wonderful end line: ""I didn't know how long we had together. Who does?"" That pretty much sums it up."
paul-allaer,"Jul 4, 2019",10/10,"I saw ""Blade Runner"" in the theater again today (more on that later). First time I saw this film, it was the original version when it came out in Belgium (where I grew up) in 1982. Decades later, I saw it again, this time on DVD and in the ""Director's Cut"" or ""Final Cut"", I can't quite remember. The version I saw today was definitely the Final Cut.""Blade Runner"" (originally released in 1982; The FInal Cut released in 2007; 117 min.) brings the story of Deckard, as he tracks down 4 replicants who have escaped from an Off World and need to be ""retired"" with extreme prejudice. As the movie opens, we are reminded it is ""Los Angeles, November, 2019"". YES, this very year! In Ridley Scott's (bleak and dark) vision of the future, LA is in permanent darkness and rain, with lots of pollution, and lots of overcrowding. Our man Deckard (Harrison Ford) meets Rachel (Sean Young), who may or may not be a replicant, who can tell for sure? In the meantime Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) is the leader of the replicants and up to no good...While watching this in the theater today, I was struck by several things: first, the enormous vision from Ridley Scott this movie asked for (and received). Second, the set design and production is out of this world STILL, now almost 40 years later. Third, while there is very little ""action"", this movie flew by in no time (same as its Blade Runner 2049 sequel, incidentally). A movie like ""Blade Runner"" begs to be seen on the big screen. As luck would have, my art-house theater here in Cincinnati is doing a month-long sci-fi classics festival during July, and this was the first (and certainly not the last) that I was eager to see again in the theater. The July 4 matinee screening where I saw this at was attended very nicely, and I imagine the later screenings will be PACKED. If you have a chance to see ""Blade Runner"" in the theater, run, do not walk! It makes for an unforgettable movie theater experience."
VJaimy,"Nov 1, 2025",10/10,"One that never fails to make me think, no matter how many times I watch it. It still gives me chills. Everything here blends together seamlessly: the visuals, the music, the atmosphere, the acting-it's cinematic perfection.Based on Philip K. Dick's Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, the film captures the essence of the book while distilling it into a vision uniquely its own. Scott stays faithful to the core ideas but heightens them through mood, imagery, and world-building. And with a cast like Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, and Sean Young, it was destined to become a cult classic.And then there's the improvised line that became unforgettable: ""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain."" Few words capture the fragility of existence so powerfully.That's the heart of this movie-identity, morality, humanity. It lingers long after the credits roll, keeping you thinking about what it means to be alive, to remember, to matter. Every layer of this film is designed to leave a mark, and it does so with haunting perfection."
claudio_carvalho,"Aug 3, 2010",10/10,"In the beginning of the Twentieth-First Century, the Tyrell Corporation releases the evolution of robots in the Nexus phase with Replicants that are identical to humans, but with superior strength and agility and the intelligence of the genetic engineers who created them. They are used off-world as slave labor in the colonization of other planets. After a bloody mutiny in a colony, the Replicants are declared illegal on Earth and hunted down by the Blade Runner units, special police squads that shoot them to kill. The execution of a Replicant is called retirement.In November 2019, in Los Angeles, the retired Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is summoned by his former chief Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh) that assigns him to hunt down four Replicants that are hidden in Los Angeles. Deckard studies the profiles of Roy (Rutger Hauer), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Leon Kowalski (Brion James) and Zhora (Joanna Cassidy) and finds that they had been designed with four years lifespan maximum and they tried to infiltrate themselves in the Tyrell Corporation. Deckard visits their creator, Dr. Eldon Tyrell (Joe Turkel), in his corporation. Sr. Tyrell asks Deckard to demonstrate his Voigt Kampff method to discover the Replicants in his assistant Rachael (Sean Young) and Deckard concludes that she is a sophisticated Replicant but she does not know. When Deckard ""retires"" Zhora and Leon, he feels affected by their deaths and by the question of Rachel whether he has tested himself to know whether he is a Replicant. But he needs to end his mission and find Roy and Pris.""Blade Runner"" is a melancholic work of art that raises existential questions about fear, life, death, emotions, mortality, humanity, dehumanization and love among other philosophical questions in an environment totally destroyed by excessive pollution, technology, marketing and consumption. The wrecked Earth is left to police and little people only, the others inhabitants have moved to the colonies in the off-world. The conflict appears when the retired Blade Runner Deckard is forced to hunt down Replicants again but now with different feelings, after falling in love for the Replicant Rachel and in doubt whether he is also a Replicant. Sean Young certainly has the best role of her career. The bleak cinematography and special effects are awesome and the soundtrack of Vangelis is among the most beautiful of the cinema history. I can not precisely say how many times I have watched the different versions of this film that is among my five favorite movies in the movie-theater, on VHS, on DVD and now on Blu-Ray, but my guess is at least twelve times. The last times I had seen this film were on 06 May 2000 and 31 May 2003. My vote is ten.Title (Brazil): ""Blade Runner"""
forbidden-1,"Dec 22, 2001",10/10,"I first saw this movie on a rented Betamax video when I was about 8 or 9. It came across as a really sinister and bleak sci-fi movie at the time.  I enjoyed it as a young kid, but guess I didn't really understand fully the themes behind the movie. I saw the vastly superior and definitive Directors Cut many years later and I instantly rated it as one of the best movies ever.  And this is why:To fully understand how good this movie is, you have to put it into the context of it's era.  When it was released it broke new ground and became what is still up to this day an unrivaled benchmark in sci-fi cinema.It was the first film to depict with such lavish splendor the nightmarish vision of future Earth.  Set in post apocalyptic Los Angeles, the film tells the tale of Deckard (Harrison Ford), a semi retired cop who is persuaded back into his role of a Blade Runner (special units trained to identify and kill outlawed androids, or ""replicants"", who illegally return to Earth). His task is to hunt and destroy a band of off-world androids, led by Rutger Hauer, who fight their way back to Earth to confront their maker, the ingenious Tyrell, head of the monstrous Tyrell Corporation.The film is dark and broody. The photography is exquisite throughout and Vangelis' musical score is a now a classic masterpiece in itself.  Director Ridley Scott's melancholy vision is so stylish and smooth that the film is able to emerse you into its chilling future world from the very first shot. Visually, this is one of the most gorgeous films I've seen.Deckard's character is similar to that of a film noir private detective. He comes across as a somewhat washed up and helpless soul lost in the polluted rat race.  This film provides Rutger Hauer with his defining moment on film, a role I think he has failed to live up to since.  With his fellow replicants, he seeks answers that only his creator can provide - all replicants all built with a lifespan of only four years and they are determined that their fate can be altered.The reason the film is so popular is that it asks so many probing questions which, in 20 years of movies since the film came out, have rarely been asked since.The themes look at humanity and the meaning and life.  Should we really create ""people"" and choose their fate and mortality?  If we choose to play god then we must be answerable to those who we create.  Is there any real difference between life created naturally and that in a laboratory?  And so do we really now what we are?  Or why we are?  Or who created us?The film is inspired by the Philip K Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""  Although this movie introduced me to reading countless Dick novels, I've deliberately resisted reading this one.  Consequently, I can't comment on how it compares although I know the book is substantially different in places.The movie is quite slow paced, although ""smooth"" is a better word.  Die hard action fanatics might not like this film although sci-fi lovers will embrace it instantly.  In the current age of computer generated effects this film is looking only very slightly dated, but that shouldn't put people off.  Even now, the ambience of Blade Runner is still unsurpassed."
DrPhibes1964,"Aug 19, 2021",6/10,"The similarities between the film and the Philip K. Dick novel are coincidental. If you read Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep you are bound to be disappointed that it is nothing like the film and you cannot imagine Harrison Ford as Rick Deckard.I admire the film more for its technical aspects and stunning visuals. I never had the opportunity to see this on a big screen. I imagine that it was something to behold. But the story itself is more or less just a routine cops and robbers scenario with some sci-fi dressings. When I first saw it it still had the much disliked voiceover narration by Harrison Ford. Many years later I saw one of the numerous alternate cuts which abandoned the narration. I found the film even more dull without it, but removing it from the final moments with Rutger Hauer was absolutely correct and gives the scene a deeper emotional impact as we project our own thoughts at what was happening. It is by far the best scene in the entire film.I am by no means the first person to suggest that the film would have been vastly improved had Rutger Hauer's Batty and the escaped androids been the central characters and Rick Deckard given slightly less screen time, especially the flat romance between him and Rachel (played by Sean Young). It takes up too much screen time and adds nothing of greater interest to the overall story. Both look like they are sleepwalking through their performances. The truly interesting characters are those androids in search of their creator in order to extend their limited lifespan. It is a theme se can all relate to. Just when we've gotten to understand our lives it's over, and all our memories are, as Batty so poignantly states, are lost in time like ""tears in the rain"". But these characters are far from noble or heroic and places us in a moral grey area and suggest the idea: How far would you go to extend your life. Batty, being an android, does not have these moral obstacles and will get to his objective by any means necessary. This could have been a truly thought-provoking film but if not for that final confrontation between Batty and Deckard it would be just an over produced police procedural. The music by Vangelis is quite haunting and adds to the otherworldly quality. The film visually arresting but emotionally empty. It was the first blu-ray I bought on account of those visuals, especially being the age before CGI effects. The miniature work is awesome."
CheeserLP,"Jun 28, 2022",6/10,"If this movie was releases today, it would be considered a comedy. People are howling like wolves for no reason, dialogue is corny and visual effects do not stand the test of time. Premise is kinda cool, but after half of thr movie it just becomes a run and gun film. Also, half of the soundtrack is some kind of sexy sax? Maybe it was cool 40 years ago, but now it feels pretty generic.Hot take - I would rather watch I, Robot."
mattymatt4ever,"Jul 2, 2002",7/10,"When I saw this movie the first time, I found it boring, meandering, pointless and utterly lifeless.  This time around I paid closer attention to the film and it grew on me.  I was intrigued by the original--though somewhat slow-moving--storyline.  The sets are elaborate and beautifully constructed.  Yet the lighting is low-key and the atmosphere is filled with smoke, giving it that neo-noir touch.  So this is not your conventional science-fiction movie.  There are no spaceship battles or goofy robots. Harrison Ford is not playing Han Solo from the ""Star Wars"" movies; this is totally different.  The performances are good all-around.  But I will still say that the film does drag.  I would edit a portion out of almost every scene.  It's obvious that Ridley Scott didn't have the pacing in mind.  And what was with that friggin' soundtrack??  Did Kenny G do the score?  I know Scott was attempting to give it a noirish feel, but the score needed to be a tad more upbeat--I mean we're not sitting in a dentist's chair for God's sake!""Blade Runner"" is not a great film, in my opinion, but a good one and pretty well-done.  I liked the ending; it wasn't predictable.  I'm surprised at how high it ranked on the IMDB:  It's Number 74!  I know the film bombed at the box office and received unanimously bad reviews, so it must've received a major cult following.  I don't have enough enthusiasm to vote this as one of the best underrated films ever made, but it's worth a look.  And you didn't like it the first time around, it's worth another look.My score:  7 (out of 10)"
RusselleBell,"Dec 12, 2004",N/A,"This is simply Scott's finest hour. There are a sheer plethora of futuristic films with vision. Films which crudely grope into a possible time ahead,when perhaps a post apocalyptic era is scattered with cliché upon cliché and often miss the whole point. What Ridley Scott achieved with this film,is an entirely possible scenario. It really does feel like a science fiction novel brought to life,but not so much as its derivative penned by Phillip K Dick(do androids dream of electric sheep?). Its a grimy,violent world inhabited by the sick,lower class,villainous second citizens who haven't quite made the grade for the off world colonies. We have a true smelting pot of nationalities.The heavy eastern references within china town like inner cities is particularly poignant.This film also sees Ford in perfect casting.Theirs a rye charm that Ford has that no other actor could fake or fill quite as effortlessly. Its a mixed review depending on what version you have seen. For me,the directors cut is simply too cut. I preferred the audience friendly screening which had the wonderful narration. The finest moment with this narration has to be the moments described by Batty in his dying eyes and the summing up by Ford of this man/machines passion and love for life.. No other sci-fi futuristic film has ever made the grade before or since in my humble opinion. It captured the raw smells and light of a brutal future scarily depicted in films or even so well. From the chase scene with Zora to the flybys over the city capturing a stunning skyline,chimneys and skyscrapers in one shot. This is my favourite movie of all time for all the reasons above and many more i could effortlessly type all day and night."

justahunch-70549,"Sep 17, 2022",10/10,"Both one of the more influential and ahead of its time films in history. This look into a future of 2019 that thankfully we've never come close to, has many versions and I believe I've seen them all. Yesterday, I watched the director's cut, which I saw once in a theatrical reissue, is the best. The poorly studio conceived narration is gone and the ending has been improved. By now everyone knows that this is about replicants, artificial people to do our bidding with short expiration dates, rebelling and wanting more life. The casting is superb for this type of thing. Ford is strong in the lead and Sean Young has never been better nor has she ever looked so amazing. Add in Rutger Hauer in I think what would be his signature role along with a great supporting cast too long to list here that are flawless. Ridley Scott is to be commended for commanding this ship of fine performances, awesome production design, great special effects and magnificent cinematography with a haunting musical score. The fact that Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography was not Oscar nominated just makes the Academy look ridiculous. This is a great sci-fi film that in 2022 has already passed the test of time and I think that will last for many years to come."
mmallon4,"Apr 18, 2021",9/10,"I often hear similar stories of people's first experiences watching Blade Runner, finding the film dull but coming to appreciate it years later - my story has the same trajectory. I first tried to watch Blade Runner (of what I believe was The Final Cut) on TV in Christmas 2009, only to stop watching after half an hour due to boredom. Over the years, however, I would be compelled to return to Blade Runner several times and get more out of it with each viewing. The tech-noir world of Blade Runner is one to get lost in with its use of neon and many billboards of geishas, albeit a more depressing, dystopian one than say that of Star Wars; one in which the city of Los Angeles appears to be stuck in a state of perpetual darkness and it very frequently rains. Now when watching Blade Runner, I'm watching a movie set in the past date of November, 2019. Once again, like Star Wars, the technology present is highly contradictory, this is a world in which flying cars exist and photographs have unimaginably high pixel counts, yet they still use CRT televisions and mobile phones don't appear to exist. It contradictions like these which we can observe in the real world just adds to the unique and fantasy aspect of the Blade Runner universe.The visual style of Blade Runner has since become a massive cliché - often imitated but never equaled. It feels like every shot or background prop has a story to tell such as those many photographs in Rick Deckard's apartment. The man-cave interior of Deckard's apartment is perfectly suited to his loner personality, a classic world-weary noir protagonist. The film's blurring of the lines between what is human and what is machine results in me always having to remind myself that these replicants of whose plight I've drawn emotional investment towards, are not humans at the end of the day. Why should I feel sorry for the vulnerable replicant Rachael with her smudged eye makeup created from her tears? Blade Runner provokes many a thought of what it means to be human. I suspect the appearance of Rachael must have come about from a desire to create an ideal woman since nobody else in Blade Runner casually dresses like a 1940's femme fatale (I haven't heard of anyone else note Rachael has a strong resemblance to Rosalind Russell in My Sister Eileen from 1942). Likewise, I don't want to know if Deckard is a replicant or not, I prefer the ambiguity and the mystery along with the many unanswered questions of this universe.The love scene between Deckard and Rachael is one of the greatest in cinema history. The sexual tension builds up as a shirtless Deckard wipes away the blood of his face and Rachael lets her hair loose. Subsequently, the manner in which Deckard prevents Rachael from leaving the apartment as he shuts the door with his fist and then proceeds to kiss her along with the saxophone solo from the love them being as close to cheesy as it can get without it being so, brings the swoon factor up to 11. My shallow desires just wish the extended, deleted version of the scene was left in any of the version of the film (in the 80's Sean Young got to have a sex scene with both Harrison Ford and Kevin Costner).The effects of globalization as seen in Blade Runner present L. A. (or at the very least one portion of the city) having Japanese inhabitants as the majority population. If the filmmakers were intending to make accurate predictions of the future, the world of Blade Runner would be more likely dominated by Chinese influence. What Blade Runner does reflect accurately about our modern world is the increasingly oppressive corporate culture and the surveillance of everyday life. There are no evident signs of government in Blade Runner yet corporations rule the roast as the Mayan pyramid-shaped headquarters of the Tyrell Corporation dominates the skyline. Like Cyberdyne Systems in The Terminator and Omni Consumer Products in Robocop, 1980's pulp sci-fi tried to warn us of the dangers of unbridled corporate power. Such power is seen turning in on itself as the film's corporate overlord, the slimy, dubious Eldon Tyrell with his magnificent glasses succumbs to a gruesome death in the only moment of the film in which I want to avert my eyes from the screen in a classic case of the Frankenstein monster turning on its creator. It's little often pointed out that Tyrell's death is very similar to the murder of Mr. Gaines in The Manchurian Candidate (1962). In both films, the murders take place at night in the victim's bedroom as they are lying in bed reading. Both characters are wearing a robe while having a chessboard, statues of animals and candles next to their beds.Lucas and Spielberg gave special editions a bad name, but Ridley Scott's Final Cut of Blade Runner actually shows they have a place (providing the option of viewing the original still exists). There are no pointless CGI additions and it fixes the niggling technical flaws of the original such as the shot of Roy Batty's dove flying towards the sky. While I appreciate the Final Cut, there is a charm to those imperfections of the original, showing that even the masters can make mistakes. I will also defend the voice-over narration present in the theatrical version. It's not up to the poetic quality of Fred MacMurray in Double Indemnity and is hokey but I find it endearingly so and does make the plot easier to follow and gives the film a bit more character (plus we get to hear Harrison Ford drop the ""N"" word).Blade Runner is by no means a nihilistic film, rather it is one that shows beauty in despair (the original ending shows that green pastures apparently still exist in this world of ecological ruin). This display of goodness, truth and beauty culminates in Roy Batty's final 42 word Tears In The Rain monologue, as the obviously Christ-like figure conjures magnificent images of Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion and C-beams glittering in the dark near the Tannhäuser Gate to the magnificent score by Vangelis. The Blade Runner soundtrack is one of the few film scores in which I can listen to the entire thing (even John Williams Ladd Company jingle is awe-inspiring). It is the perfect accompaniment to walking down any urban landscapes at night (I can recall multiple mornings when I would listen to Tears In The Rain as the sun would rise back when I worked night shifts) as oneself reflects over its romantic nature and harkens for nostalgia, often and like the replicants in the movie, for memories we don't even have."
machngunjoe,"Jan 2, 2008",6/10,"Certainly the most over-rated sci-fi film of our time. OK it looked quite distinct in 1982, and the image of a grim future with giant TV screens high above the city was memorable and somewhat accurate for what we see in todays Hong Kong.Plot? There's not much to say, the film contradicts itself many times and the weak and limp tale crawls along.Acting? Ford's OK, Young is pretty and dull, Olmos is cool, twenty years before being cool fighting Cylons, and Hannah is sexy but hopelessly out of her depth.Apologists for Scott's fiasco blame the evil ""suits"" for messing up their Lord's film but in truth the directors cut is worse than the original movie.The sound is badly mixed too."

dokha,"Aug 20, 2023",6/10,"I love Science Fiction..
And I thought it felt right to watch this before watching the recent 2017 remake.. This one is directed by the awesome Ridley Scott.. I had high expectations.. And ofcourse judging from my extensive experience within this genre, older Sci-fi are much, much better than the recent ones, mainly because they have a *philosophically sound foundation* and *interesting storyline*, I do NOT put too much concern for the CGI and other superficial aspects as an ordinary person does while watching this genre..
Anyway, remember when I mentioned ""older Sci-fi are much better than recent ones"" therein comes my mistake, I haven't known the exact time frame from which Sci-fi movies have become good..Now I know it started from around the early 90s..
The major problem I have with this movie is that over 90% of the happenings in this film, weren't sci-fi aspects at all, it was boring old investigative or detective work.. If you liked The Departed and found it sooo _THRILLING_, _EXCITING_ and _SUSPENSEFUL_, then by all means you should watch Blade Runner 1982 Final Cut. I don't care how highly rated a movie is, if it's boring;- for example, using cookie cutter- / run of the mill- concepts or events, the same used for/in countless other movies, I will never watch it.. These scenes are stuffing scenes they ad no real value to the viewing experience, here, they are too much.. And if I did watch a boring movie with high ratings such as this one, I would certainly give it a failing review.. But since it was only 1982,
I guess people were bland back then and they liked bland things, therefore a 6/10 is fair..
This movie was mostly dull and not as genuine as I thought it would be.. If you like Harrison Ford, watch The Fugitive instead.. Another (even older) movie that is overrated yet suffers from dull and boring syndrome is 2001 A Space Odyssey, two thirds into that movie, I shut it off and never to return again.. lol."
sia_hamwala,"Jan 23, 2021",6/10,"Top list for one of the most overrated movies of all time, WAYY too slow with 0 substance, visually brilliant, kinda reminds me of ""gangster saqud"" in that regard. Looks good but might just be a waste of time.I gather most of the hype is due to the time it came out, i gather it must have been a revolutionary movie for the time, but most definitely doesnt stand the test of time."
formiscosas,"Nov 20, 2010",1/10,"For the life of me I can't think of a reason why this movie is held with such high regards in the sci-fi community, except for having the holy trinity of geekdom (it's set in the future, sexy robots and Harrison Ford). Every movie geek that wants to secure their geek cred will go out of their way saying this movie is awesome and the best thing to happen to sci-fi since the invention of movies. In reality, they are loath to admit that it's a boring, overrated piece of cinematographic crap that nobody outside the community actually likes. Even though I've had all my life to watch this movie, I've never made it the whole way through in one sitting. In fact, I've seen more of Flash Gordon and Conan in one sitting than I have of this movie (and the fact that I made it almost all the way through both Guru and Gigli is a testament to my unwillingness to turn away from a movie once I start to watch them). Overall, a boring movie that nobody should bother with. If you want Ford, robots or movies set in the future there are far better things out there than this one. Having all the things you like in one movie doesn't make it good."
Michael_Elliott,"Nov 24, 2012",N/A,"Blade Runner (1982)** 1/2 (out of 4) Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is one of the best Blade Runner's in the business. A Blade Runner is a person who is paid to go after illegal replicants and the most recent case has him going after four including the sadistic Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer).Ridley Scott's BLADE RUNNER was released with minor fans but overtime it grew into what many consider one of the greatest science fiction movies ever made. It's really hard to judge or rate this movie because it's available in so many different versions. This viewing here was actually the third version I've seen and I gotta say that if you have to keep re-editing, adding and altering a movie then I question how good it is to begin with.I know many people consider BLADE RUNNER to be one of the greatest movies ever made. I honestly get their reaction but I certainly don't share it. The film is certainly one of the most brilliantly looking movies ever made. Visually this film is rather incredible as director Scott has no problem creating the mood of this dark city as well as the rather grim nature. The special effects, costume design, sets and music score are all flawless and perfectly capture a terrific vision.With that said, I think there's a lot more style than substance here. Not for a second did I ever get totally involved in the ""story"" going on. I thought it was a rather interesting idea but storywise there's nothing great here. I also thought the slow nature was a bit too boring. I know this is a thinking man's approach but it just didn't work with me. With that said, the ending is quite excellent and I thought the scenes between Ford and Hauer were extremely effective.The performances from the entire cast is another major plus with Ford perfect in the role, which is a throwback to the type of detectives that we'd see in film noir titles of the 40s and 50s. Hauer makes for a great villain and we get nice support from Sean Young, M. Emmet Walsh, Edward James Olmos, William Sanderson, Joe Turkel and Daryl Hannah among others.Again, I understand why some call BLADE RUNNER one of the greatest films ever made. In my opinion, the original theatrical cut is quite poor. The Director's Cut was certainly an improvement. Having now just watched ""The Final Cut"" it reall didn't improve too much from the director's cut. As is, I'd probably recommend the Director's Cut."

carolanthony,"Apr 18, 2023",10/10,"This is the best movie I have ever seen. It is based on the book ""Dream Androids about electric sheep?"", and the soundtracks were made by vangelis! The film is accompanied by a constant state of suspense, due to unusual angles and scenes, which are terribly stretched to create a sombre melancholy. Such a set of feelings cannot but touch your soul and spoil your mood for the whole day! Also, the film raises difficult questions, like ""How much human more humanised than a programmed machine"" and many others. Seeping of complexity and drenched in neo-noir conventions, Blade Runner is an all-consuming and divergent movie that has beautiful imagery while asking questions regarding humanity and scientific advancement and at the same time feeling immensely fresh, deeply layered and bracingly audacious."
itsFreebs,"Oct 6, 2025",9/10,"It is difficult to do a review of ""Blade Runner"". Not because the film itself really requires that you don't know a little about handling in order to enjoy it the most, but that there are actually several versions of this reel. The fact that these also almost completely change history does not make it any easier. At the time of writing, approximately (!) seven different variants have shown up. The latest of these is Ridley Scott's so-called ""Final Cut"", which was released as recently as four years ago. For those who don't know which of the films you have set, I'm not going to analyze the differences, but let's say that the two latest versions, both personally approved by Scott himself, have an ending that is much darker than their predecessors.Which one you choose first is of course a matter of taste, but if you don't know anything, look at the latest ""Final Cut"" which in my opinion is the one that gives the most. Meanwhile, technology hasn't been too kind to ""Blade Runner."" Where ""Alien"" still holds up surprisingly well today, this film feels significantly more dated to the 1980s. It's not really possible to put your finger on what this is due to. ""Blade Runner"" is exciting, interesting and gripping, but feels a bit well distanced. You don't get the same empathy for the characters as you did for Sigourney Weaver's Ripley."
ello-03383,"Jan 27, 2022",6/10,"I couldn't get past was the depiction of women. Women are painted completely differently from men. All high positions are occupied by men, their attitude is superior to women and what made me most shocked is the ""making love"" scene. It only seems that Decker is raping Rachel and as I understand it, the director has pressured the female actress to do this, she neither wanted nor expected this and did not have those plans for her acting career."
brasileiro_revoltado,"Sep 9, 2020",10/10,"HOW TO TRULY APPRECIATE BLADE RUNNERYou have to watch this movie with the right mindset and know some of the context behind it to really enjoy it. Otherwise, you'll watch it expecting a random cyberpunk action flick, failing to understand what you're watching and may end up rating it 1/10 like I did (my old review is below).Blade Runner is not a movie you merely watch; you have to appreciate its atmosphere and dive into its world.Here are a few things I wish I knew before my first watch: Blade Runner is a dense, atmospheric, and deeply philosophical film. Its visuals, its take on philosophy and morality were revolutionary at the time, and they influenced films such as The Matrix, Ghost in The Shell, Total Recall, Dark City, Minority Report, The Fifth Element and many others.This movie basically invented the modern cyberpunk genre. Thus, it's important to know some context around it.==WHAT THIS IS NOT==AN ACTION MOVIE - There's barely any action in the entire movie.A REBELLION STORY - There is no clear villain to defeat, no empire to topple, humanity isn't on the brink of destruction. There's no big revolution about to happen.FAST-PACED - The pace is deliberately slow and meditative.A STORY WITH EASY ANSWERS - The plot leans heavily into ambiguity and avoids tidy resolutions; it ends on a note of profound ambiguity that has sparked debate for over 40 years.==WHAT THIS IS==AN UNPARALLELED MOOD PIECE - From the first, towering shot of a dystopian Los Angeles in 2019, with geysers of fire erupting into a perpetual night, the goal is immersion. The world itself is a character - bleak, decaying, and mesmerizingly beautiful.DEEPLY PHILOSOPHICAL - At its core, Blade Runner is about one question: What does it mean to be human? The plot follows Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford), a burnt-out detective hunting down a group of rogue bio-engineered androids called Replicants. But as he hunts them, the moral lines blur. The Replicants, led by the brilliant and terrifying Roy Batty, are not emotionless machines; they are passionate, intelligent, and desperate for more life. They exhibit more wonder, love, and fear of death than the jaded humans around them.The film forces you to ask: Who is the real monster? The ""human"" who kills without passion or the ""machine"" who cherishes life with tragic intensity?It touches upon other ethical issues, the morality of the protagonists vs the replicants; it's all in this gray zone that's so familiar and distant at the same time. It's embedded in the film's atmosphere.A VISUAL SHOW - In terms of visuals, it's like a peacock showing off its feathers. Cinematographer Jordan Cronenweth paints with light and shadow. Neon signs glow on wet streets, beams of light cut through smoky rooms, and the constant rain gives everything a melancholic sheen. This ""future noir"" aesthetic, now endlessly copied, was utterly revolutionary in 1982.==IMPORTANT CONTEXT==The context of the film's production is key to understanding its unique feel. Director Ridley Scott was a visual stylist from the world of advertising, and his focus was on crafting every frame meticulously. He's known to have ignored the actors and for not giving them any instructions on how he expected them to act.Harrison Ford was famously frustrated and felt lost, and he didn't get along with Scott. The irony is sublime: Ford's very real burnout and alienation seeped directly into his performance, making Deckard's world-weariness palpably authentic. The tense, chaotic set mirrored the film's dystopian world, and the result was accidental genius.Now, about the visuals, you might find the movie boring because it spends a lot of time just soaking in the Los Angeles of 2019 that Scott envisioned. It's like an artist slowly walking you through their gallery. This might seem pointless, but again, back then it was breaking new ground.Before Blade Runner, sci-fi movies generally followed one of two trends:The clean, sleek, minimalist future of 2001: A Space Odyssey, Star Wars or TRON.The post-apocalyptic wasteland future seen in countless other films.Blade Runner rejected both and created its own ""future noir"" aesthetic. It's a world of deep shadows, light filtering through blinds, lots of smoke and vapor. Neon glows on wet streets in a city where it's always night and nearly always raining. The constant steam, smoke, and fog create a feeling of environmental decay that perfectly mirrors the moral decay of its characters.Without spoilers, the story is intense and operates entirely in a moral gray zone. The characters are morally ambiguous, society is corrupt, and entire industries profit from it. The film constantly makes you question if a character's actions were right or wrong, and those questions will stick with you long after the credits roll.And that's where this movie shines. It's a masterclass in weaving deep philosophical questions into a deceptively simple detective story.==FINAL THOUGHTS==In the end, I have only one real criticism: for a guy with a legendary reputation, the main character gets his ass whipped quite a lot. His skills don't seem to match his rep. But besides that, this movie is, indeed, a masterpiece.==OLD REVIEW, FOR COMPARISON==TITLE: Excruciatingly slow pace, lackluster plotThis movie is beyond boring. 40 minutes into it and it is technically beginning.The main reason for the slow progress are the excruciatingly slow scenes where the director wanted to show his futuristic scenarios, where it takes 5, 6, 7 minutes just showing stuff around.Run away, this movie sucks.OLD RATING: 1/10."
paul_m_haakonsen,"Jun 9, 2018",6/10,"Funny but I remember this movie much more fondly from my teenage years. But I guess the memory data has been corrupted throughout the years.While the setting and atmosphere was nothing short of spectacular in Ridley's ""Blade Runner"" from 1982, then the movie was just incredibly slow in progressing anywhere. And once it actually kicked into high speed, it ended within 10 minutes!The acting was quite good and they did indeed have a very good ensemble of acting performers on the cast list. Harrison Ford, of course, carried the movie phenomenally. And he was joined nicely on the screen by the likes of Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, M. Emmet Walsh and Edward James Olmos.The special effects in ""Blade Runner"" were good, especially when taking into consideration the age of the movie.

THE-BEACON-OF-MOVIES-RAFA,"Feb 16, 2020",10/10,"Magic. The stuff books are made of. Palpable, dreamlike, experimental, industrial and just pure magic. When a film is this flawed and yet still floors absolutely everyone with its power to command tone and its ability to influence and yet still stand alone, it's clearly worthy of the praise and the acclaim. There are very few cyberpunk movies and even less good ones. Blade Runner is simply the best one. It's also a work of art and one of the best movies ever made. There are moments where Harrison Ford's Deckard aches with deep sadness, a lost soul himself looking out over the wretchedness that has become of the world, shaking and confused when he buys a bottle of vodka immediately after retiring his 'first' replicant. In these moments it doesn't matter either way if he is a replicant or not, amidst all the more well-known highlights of this classic, these humanising and most overlooked moments are why I love it so deeply."

I still like the shock of the green with the Vangelis music driving into the future. Also I like the voice-overs despite their detractors. I love the final voice-over during the happy ending which is eliminated in the final cut. In addition, I cannot abide by Deckard being a Replicant. This is great cyberpunk vision of the future. Its designs are still influential. I love the hard-boiled noir genre being married to a sci-fi movie. It does move slowly in the middle but I accept that flaw. It is meticulous and detailed visually. The Philip K. Dick story is compelling. It remains an important sign post in the sci-fi genre."

His job is to kill replicants just because they are illegal on earth. He interview an employee of tyrell corporation Rachel, who turns out to be a replicant with memory implants. The other four replicants he is chasing are the nexus 6 model, a strong new advance replicants used for military which makes Deckards chase more dangerous, but their crime is they want more life.The movie has a very strong philosophy in the story, what is real and what is not, is Deckard human or not, and do replicants have feelings or are they implants. This kind of philosophy movie was unusual at that time and revolutionized the way we make movies today. It's a strong 10/10 and forever and ever more."
SpelingError,"May 2, 2015",8/10,"This is a slow moving sci-fi film but it has great themes. It's about a man in the police force who's hired to kill 4 murderous replicants. It's mostly slow-paced but its engaging climax and great production choices are what makes it such a masterpiece. Its themes require audience's to think rather than experience. The voice overs are unnecessary but later cuts are devoid of them. Ridley Scott has proved to be a visionary artist here by producing a bleak society where it's always dark and raining. Its climax serves as an iconic portrayal of ""man vs. machine"". Its climax is very moving and engaging and it's one of the more memorable scenes from the 80's. Then at the last shot, the movie pulls the rug out from under you. I liked the cinematography. It made the movie look bleak and it made the society look like it was dwindling. The acting was strong on all parts especially coming from Harrison Ford. Because of this movie's production choices, I can see why it's as famous as it is today. Unfortunately, it failed at the box office probably because it came out 2 weeks later than E.T. the Extra Terrestrial. But it has become a cult classic and today it's regarded as of the best sci-fi and neo-noir films."
rachelhsiang,"Jun 19, 2021",10/10,"After watching the Blade Runner, he dreamed about a unicorn, it reminds me I dreamed it as well, once.No, it's not one, it's they.I remembered at that time I could only feel pure joy, as if I was holding a telescope,
Like childhood play toy,
What does it mean, that was my most beautiful time out of reality, it's in dream.It says: The unicorn symbolism is linked to purity, freedom, gentleness, virginity, innocence, divinity, and magic. Christians believe that the unicorn symbol is that of Christ and Mother Mary themselves. Seeing unicorns in dreams is inevitably a sign of good luck, happiness, and a positive omen.Aren't we like Deckard, but the only difference is : he knew he live in a world where there is the replicants and the human, so he could be one of the two , but we don't have any doubt absolutely with the world we live in, as a fan of Sci-fi movies, after watching them ( the blade runner, Matrix) , you will start to doubt yourself, if memory and feeling could implant in our brain, I mean , if it just some thing like putting a button inside you then triggering you having a certain reaction, that was a kind of I don't know, it's a very weird feeling, gives you a shiver."
ShanTeaTime,"Nov 2, 2019",6/10,"A 1982 Science-Fiction film set in the year 2019 Los Angeles. Here, synthetic humans known as replicants are bio-engineered by the powerful Tyrell Corporation to work on off-world colonies. When a fugitive group of Nexus-6 replicants led by Roy Batty escapes back to Earth, burnt-out cop Rick Deckard reluctantly agrees to hunt them down.This was yet another film I had to watch for my Filmic Text class that I had never seen before. I know it's regarded as one of the ""greatest science-fiction films of all time"", but I'm going to argue that Ridley Scott's ""Alien"" is a far superior film. That's not to say ""Blade Runner"" was a bad film, it's not but I have my gripes with it. Let's start off with the positives though. The clear argument about humanity, more specifically what makes us human is very interesting to me. Also the replicants themselves have enough depth to them where they were interesting as well, and how it's determined if they are replicants is quite cool. The futuristic sets that mix futuristic los angeles and asian culture was a really stellar idea, though it's borders on racist at times. We really didn't need to cut to a geisha billboard throughout the film. Moving onto one of the negatives, the pacing. It felt dragged down at parts, without tension like shown in ""Alien"" this kind of pacing is felt amongst viewers.Rachael's character I could relate to the most, but seeing how important her character really is to the plot she should've been present more. Also the argument of ""that scene"" between Deckard and Rachael in his apartment is not justified because of the year this was made. It's ironic how a film like this could have a scene like that that's supposed to be set in 2019 whereas its that year now and that would not fly in the slightest nowadays! It's way too sexual assaulty for me to be comfortable watching it, when clearly it's intended to be ""romantic"" by the choice of jazz music and lighting. This is the one scene that I agreed with my class that felt completely out of place and against Deckard's character thus far.No I have not seen all versions of the film and I'm not going to. It's a little asinine to me when people claim that you ""have to watch all versions"" in order to grasp the full concept of the film. No I'm pretty sure I got the idea from whatever version I saw, its Harrison Ford running around being Harrison Ford. With cool visuals and relevant concept, even more so in current day than when it was released. But it has quite a few problems and I hope these were fixed in the sequel."
lastliberal,"Jun 4, 2008",6/10,"There is no disputing the fact that this film was visually stunning. The contrast between the rich and poor, the bright lights and the crumbling buildings, the constant rain and darkness; all made for a beautiful picture.In addition, the music of Vangelis was more than appropriate for the film. It was a treat to the ear.But, that said, the story itself was a disappointment. There really just didn't seem to be much there that would qualify this film to be considered a classic.I watched as a tribute to Harrison Ford. He had that same edge that he had in Raiders of the Lost Ark, released the year before. He had a maturity that was missing in Star Wars. He was totally believable in this role.But that was it. A minute or two of Joanna Cassidy to titillate, a clownish Darryl Hannah, and a conflicted Rutger Hauer did nothing to make this anything more than a showcase for Ford.It was an enjoyable experience, but still a disappointment."
Gummo-12,"Dec 20, 1998",1/10,"An exercise in graphic design. A movie that wanted to speak to the human condition, but choosing to do so by avoiding all things human. There's lighting, and costumes, and set design to burn, but all the actors have been forbidden to act. One cardinal rule has been adhered to, ""show no emotion"". In the future, it rains all the time and we've all become automatons, sheesh, would somebody mind writing a movie for this trailer?"
arkif1,"Feb 11, 2007",10/10,"There are several extraordinary things about Blade Runner.1) It does not state who's good and who's bad. 2) It throws you into a scenario that you'll probably not enjoy. 3) It doesn't bother to explain why things are the way they are. 4) It shows us something that, although it doesn't exist anywhere, still has an existential meaning to us.Apart from that Blade Runner has the best score ever. Vangelis created a style that in its simplicity strikes you far more as being of the future than any more sophisticated electronic music could ever do.The thing I was referring to in 4. is a grown up without experiences of his own. That is a logical impossibility, a paradox. But paradoxically it's one of the most powerful stimuli of existential reflection that were ever shown in cinema. The point being that it lets you ask yourself what all your experiences were good for.Not quite so subtle, yet still of interest, is the idea that you could be born into life knowing full well what your purpose is and how long you'll live. What does that do to you? The film answers that though, it's unacceptable, you'll deny it, seek something else, something more. It just cannot be that everything will be lost like tears in rain.But human ambition is a much broader theme of this film. The world itself, in which Blade Runner takes place, is a statement about the human longing for progress and power, his forwardness and his backwardness. Some concepts seem ridiculous from nowadays perspective, but the overall atmosphere is right on the spot. And in this respect I have to say that the original cut has the better ending, because of the contrast, because of all the emotions that are awakened by that contrast, which does not appear cheesy, but rather estranged, a release into the completely unknown."
joebloggscity,"Apr 7, 2015",9/10,"You can only be in awe of this seminal film.Retro showings of the director's cut in the cinema gave me the wonderful opportunity to watch this film in this final cut on the giant screen for the first time. For some reason it brings out so much more to see. I'd watched it on video and DVD on my old home teles, but now for the real experience as the director always wanted.Where should we begin. The inspirational look, the majestic synth music or the existential allegories. No short review can do this film justice. There's just so much to discuss and take from this film. There are no answers, but questions and thoughts.I really recommend this to all. As a tour de force of cinema and sci-fi, it truly is peerless. Can't wait to watch it again."
afonsobritofalves,"Sep 19, 2018",9/10,"One of the best films of the 80's and one of the greatest classics ever. This film is one of those movies that has everything, has action, adventure, suspense, science fiction and persecution. In addition, the film has actors such as Harrisn Ford, had a good director (Ridley Scott), had a good soundtrack and had special effects. Highly recommend."
Masoo,"Apr 18, 2002",7/10,"I've seen Blade Runner many, many times. It may hold the record for Most Times I Have Seen a Movie I Don't Actually Like. Like most people, I admire the look of the film. I don't know that I appreciate the look as much as others; while I admit it was very influential on the look of subsequent movies, its style-over-substance nature has also been influential, and I don't think that's a good thing. And, again like most people, I am intrigued by the subject matter (what is human?).That's about it for the things I like. As for what I don't like, well, first off, I'm one of those Philip K. Dick fans. There is a lot more going on in the book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? than shows up in the movie (and yes, I know that's the standard complaint of book lovers, but it's true here). The most important missing element in the movie is ""Mercerism,"" a semi-religion that is v.important in the book's philosophy. In any event, I don't think Blade Runner does a good job of getting at much essential Dickworld. For me, the best example of that world on film remains the scene in Total Recall when the bad guys try to convince Arnold in the hotel room that he is actually sitting back home in a chair enjoying a virtual, rather than real, experience.As for the non-Dickian aspects of the movie, well, if you've heard from the legions of Blade Runner fans what a classic it is, you'll likely be surprised on first viewing to find out that it's kinda boring. Apparently to help make the point that the emotional lives of humans and replicants are too similar to tell apart, director Ridley Scott instructs the actors playing humans (or supposed humans) to underplay, to make them seem more mechanical, then lets King of the Replicants Rutger Hauer overact oddly, as if he was a leftover from Kubrick's Clockwork Orange (another so-called classic with crappy acting from everyone not named Malcolm McDowell). I guess Hauer's bogus emoting is supposed to make him seem more human than the humans, but this is only true if humans are scenery-chewers.Ultimately, it's hard to care about any of the characters in the film. I suppose that could be one of the ""points"" it's trying to make; I suspect it's more what happens when you cast dull-as-nails Sean Young in a leading role. Again, I'm aware that this distancing-from-humanity feel could be on purpose. That doesn't make it any more enjoyable. The movie gets everything right except the people. As usual, Pauline Kael hit it on the head: ""It hasn't been thought out in human terms. If anybody comes around with a test to detect humanoids, maybe Ridley Scott and his associates should hide."""
HoustonPresChurch,"Feb 7, 2012",9/10,"I actually appreciated the audio best because, even in this new Blu-Ray era, one doesn't often find a film with very active surround speakers. However, this ""restored"" version did and the sound is, at the point, the best I've heard on a Blu-Ray disc....or any DVD, for that matter. The visuals? Well, fans of Blade Runner know all about them. They are fantastic. Scene-after-scene reminded me of a Stanley Kubrick film or another bizarre 1980s movie called ""Jacob's Ladder."" Because there are so many things to see and hear, and the story is different, one filled with strange characters, I can see where people would watch this film multiple times and enjoy it very much each time. The ""Collector's Edition"" has the best picture ever, according to director Ridley Scott, and ""is the version I'm most pleased with."" It has added scenes one didn't see in earlier versions. The rest of the DVD has those earlier versions. Apparently, there are several including those with Harrison Ford doing narration, like out of a late '40s film noir.Speaking of the latter, that's what this film looked like: a combination film noir (or neo-noir) and sci-fi movie. It has many dark images, fantastic night-time scenes, wonderful closeups and an always-interesting color palette. Sci-fi films usually get dated in a hurry, thanks to ever-increasing special-effects progress in the movie industry, but this still looks very good. Despite being made over 25 years ago, Blade Runner still looks very much state-of-the-art."
loganfoster,"Jan 7, 2019",10/10,I can't count the number of times I have watched this movie! This neo-noir sci-fi epic puts you in the mindset of a not too far fetched dark future. Amazing film score and one hell of a plot!!
Luv2Spooge,"Nov 10, 2023",5/10,"When Blade Runner first came out, it was a complete office bomb for a reason. Later it developed a cult following and much of the current high rating came from there since IMDb did not exist in 1982. For that I think this score is ridiculously bloated because most reviewers are die hard fans.The premise of the film is great and it is the first of its kind focus on a futuristic dystopia. It is the model that set forth future films either of the complete same genre such as Ghost in a Shell, The Fifth Element, etc... or influenced their vision of an overcrowded future cityscape such as Star Wars Prequels.The problem with the film itself was the execution. It couldn't decide whether to be an action genre or one of those deep philosophical ones. The plot dragged and was not really well planned out. The visuals were a mix for me. Some of them, especially the flying scenes were amazing. However, the street views were a bit too dark to see and way too messy to often make out what was going on.The music is also a mix. At times it was spot on, while other times it is too loud and didn't quite fit the scene. All of this was rectified in the sequel 2049, which is more of a masterpiece and improvement upon this version.The story line also couldn't decide whether to dev more into the lore or focused on the ""awkward"" romance between Deckard and Rachel.Anyways, overall it balances out as a 5/10 for me. To be honest, I think you can just watch 2049 without watching this one. 2049 has everything you like in this one, but improved, cleaned up, and just overall a much better experience."
fred-83,"Dec 7, 2006",10/10,"Many have praised this one before me, so I will try to keep my comment brief. One of the few movies which still towers majestically over the majority of SF-movies produced before or since. I rate this, along with 2001 and Solaris, as masterpieces of cinema which take the medium to another level. Funny that there are three SF-movies on my top ten movies of all time. In this age of CGI, the environment created for this film has still never been equalled. It is not just the intense layering and detail, it is also the pace which we move through the environment that is just as important. Allowing us time to rest and contemplate the surroundings, along with the magnificent music, brings out so much more atmosphere and sense of place. The acting is interesting, mixing low-key realism with the highly theatrical style of Hauer and Turkel. Yet that mixing never feels out of place. Also, the important ingredient Ridley has in BR that has been lacking in some of his subsequent efforts, is a rich, multi-levelled story. The existential aspects, what is human, real versus artificial memories, the unanswered questions. Almost all movies I consider to be masterpieces have an unanswered question at the end and which brings me back for subsequent watchings. This is one of them. May it soon appear on a Special Ed. DVD with tons of extras."
justin-fencsak,"Oct 2, 2017",10/10,"When Blade Runner first came out 35 years ago, it debuted at 2nd place next to ET and way ahead of another sci-fi masterpiece that debuted that weekend...the thing. It barely made its budget yet made it back when it hit home video the following year in a European version and again in a director's cut in 1992 and again in 2007 with Ridley's approved version. Before you go see 2049, see this one."

It was directed by famous writer and director Ridley Scott. Starring legendary Harrison Ford and famous only in his native Holland Rutger Hauer. The main female role went Sean Young for who it was a debut in the full-length movie.The film tells us the story of Rick Deckard(Harrison Ford) replicant(androids) hunter. Once he gets a task to stop a group of replicants who escaped from a colony. However, the group under the Roy Batty( Rutger Hauer) command is not going to give up. Pursuing a group, Deckard understands that he has strange feeling in relation to one replicant Rachael(Sean Young). This is the main question of the film whether people can feel something to the machines and if so, are they different from us.""Blade Runner"" has a lot of positive moments. Firstly, the movie looks very spectacular. Special effects look realistic and the style is one of the best in cyberpunk stories.

selfedluke,"Aug 7, 2020",10/10,"The Godfather 2 of Sci-Fi. Watching this is an almost transcendental experience that transports you into the best world-building ever put on the big screen.I've never seen cyberpunk so well realized, and to think this was all made in 1980 with real sets, real lighting, and real weather effects makes it all the more mind-blowing.Based off an alternative timeline that began in sprawl/freeway inception of the 1950s, Blade Runner combines 20th century concepts like hyper scale globalization, environmental collapse, and techno-obsessive city planning to project a sort of nightmarish collage of all our old and present fears about the rot of modernity by showing us a vision of 2019 Los Angeles as a city of 100 million global refugees (likely because of a small scale nuclear war which made most cities uninhabitable and caused many to migrate here).The way this movie portrays depth and claustrophobia is masterful. I really feel like I'm an inhabitant of this insane nightmare city whenever we see its dozens of outdoor sequences.Storywise it's one of the greats of science fiction history as well. It's a slow-burning atmospheric thriller that stuns you with how well it's intellectual ideas blend with the overall film and aren't in your face or too hard to notice. It's a film about what makes life worth living, what defines consciousness, and the many gray areas of ethics that exist in its universe.10/10- A Masterpiece"
moritz-glade,"Feb 1, 2018",N/A,"Plenty of in-depth analyses can be found on RT or IMDb singing praise of a sci-fi classic that is older than Matrix and Gattaca and yet touches the question of ""What makes a human human?"" more convincingly than virtually all movies that came after it.I'll cut myself short for one message:WATCH THE DIRECTORS CUT. ONLY.The initial reception of Blade Runner in its ""Theatrical Release"" was what it deserved, something around a 7/10. Because it was streamlined for a mass audience upon release, simplified to a detective story. The ""Directors Cut"" rectified this, thankfully, by adding crucial scenes (unicorn, the ""Immortal game"" as Tyrell's chess match) in favour of the botched ending for a much more thought-provoking and enigmatic movie. The slightly inferior, ""Final Cut"" version turned it into more of a modern action movie: Whilst still an enjoyable version to watch, it is a little on the nose, pushing its message forward and lacking the subtlety and precision of the DC. It's also more graphic - which, in this movie, is arguably entirely unnecessary.There is Science Fiction like Terminator, and there is Science Fiction that utilizes a futuristic setting as a stage, set to ask a question. The narrative serves to make it a little more appealing, the profanity to make it a little less pretentious. You may like Sci-Fi or you may find it ludicrous. In times of AI emulating humans better than ever before, this movie is as relevant as it is still entertaining. Watch it, if you like movies that make you think. It's a classic for a reason. It's brilliant.""You know what a turtle is? Same thing."""

Watching this lame movie is a waste of time but a good time to take a nap because you wouldn't have missed anything. This movies rating of 8.3 should be reversed to 3.8 because every movie ranked lower than 8.3 in the top 250 is twice as good as blade runner. Its literally impossible to watch this movie than believe its ranked higher than avengers, star trek and gravity.

There are very few movies that are like that for me, where I find myself halfway through with no idea what's really going on because the movie can't hold my attention (just for frame of reference, the new Fantastic Four is another like it...). I really wanted to like this movie, and it's weird that I don't if what everyone else says is true. But the plot is so convoluted and meaningless, the acting (aside from the incomparable Ford) is flat, and...again, the plot is just...non-existent?I kinda feel like this movie is like the emperor's new clothes. Someone decided it was great because they wanted a new thesis for their film school paper, and everyone else is now deluding themselves into liking it because they want to be smart too.Alternatively, it might be like coffee and is an acquired taste, I will admit that is a possibility.

Without writing something so long no one cares to read and at the same time not sounding pretentious, it's a visually cool looking film but that's about it. The story is very slow and before any one says it's about existentialism and questions what life is, STOP. If you have to ask what it is about, it doesn't deliver it's message.

x_manicure_x,"Aug 14, 2021",8/10,"""Blade Runner"" might have its flaws, but it is still the quintessential cyberpunk blockbuster. The undercooked love story and the goofy action sequences are the inevitable product of its time, but aesthetically it was miles ahead. I recently watched the director's cut 4K remaster and, hairstyles and old TV sets aside, it could almost pass as a fairly recent film. Ridley Scott goes for a neo-noir kind of investigation and paints the dystopian streets of Los Angeles in a decadent, almost gothic tone that reminds of his rainy London.Thematically, the plot raises questions about what it means to be human in a time where there is no perceivable difference between man and machine, to the point that even the nature of memories is to be questioned. These are pretty common reflections in sci-fi literature, and I always thought that ""Blade Runner"" limited itself to giving some cues without digging too deep into the mind of its characters for the sake of the few moments of action (the critics basically did the rest writing pages and pages of overanalyzing). Rick Deckard's motivation for what he does is never fully explored, and so is his rather forced relationship with Rachael. He walks around and defeats one replicant after another like in an arcade fighting game. The film makes a point to show how the androids are more united and human than the morally decayed men of 2019, but little screen time is devoted to exploring their nature.An impressive film for its time and solid cyberpunk neo-noir, but definitely not what I would call an all-time masterpiece."
papanloveu,"Jan 13, 2022",8/10,"Blade Runner is stunning. It is one of the most beautiful films ever made. It has a great story, great performances, terrific action and eventually leaves a solid impact. I have seen the final cut, and I really liked it. Despite the very slow pace, I could actually enjoy the film and get amazed at this high-quality filmmaking.This film isn't fast-paced and doesn't simply jump to the main story within minutes. The first half sets up the characters and conflict, eventually followed by well-executed action sequences and intriguing character drama along with some really good twists. The rainy weather seemed to work for me. Most of the film happens at night, thus creating its own stylish atmosphere.Harrison Ford plays his part brilliantly and so does Rutger Hauer.There's a good amount of intensity that makes it a very intriguing watch. Blade Runner is undoubtedly one of the best sci-fi action movies of all time, also because it portrays 2019 in a realistic way."
MovieMan-40,"Sep 9, 1998",N/A,"Taken from the novel DO ANDROIDS DREAM OF ELECTRIC SHEEP? by the late, great science fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, BLADE RUNNER must be ranked as one of, if not the, greatest visual achievements in the history of cinema. Directed by Ridley Scott (Alien), the story focuses on Los Angeles, 2019. A film-noir technopunk verisimilitude dominates in this time, as large blimps extoll the virtues of going ""off-world,"" while the majority of people live in pollution and towering pyramid buildings, where strobe lights of various hovercrafts wind across gothic stone gargoyles, where the sun never seems to rise and the torrents of rain never stop.  The culture of Los Angeles seems to naturally grow from our present time; there is a large Asian and Hispanic community and culture.  Deckard (played with a splendidly Marlowean low-key by Harrison Ford) is a ""Blade Runner""- cops specially trained to eliminate illegal off-world worker androids who run amok on earth.  The leader of the ""replicants,"" Roy (Rutger Hauer), seek only a chance to live beyond their pre-determined deaths.  As Deckard descends further and further into the hunt through the seedy streets, he also discovers a most unusual love interest-- a legal android (Sean Young) who refuses to believe her memories are fake. As mentioned before, BLADE RUNNER has a wonderfully unique vision of the future, created by visualist Syd Meier, that every science fiction film from RUNAWAY to THE FIFTH ELEMENT has ""borrowed,"" to put it nicely. However, what truly makes the story compelling is the quest for humanity, and what truly makes us human.  If at all possible, view the Director's Cut: the ending is completely different, more realistic, and ultimately more powerful.  Truly a classic, and four stars out of four."
mercuryix-1,"Jan 15, 2008",6/10,"There are so many comments regarding this movie that I doubt anything I write will be seen as relevant. Obviously it's affected a lot of people, because of all the comments here. I saw this movie when it first came out, then I saw it again when they thankfully removed Harrison Ford's voiceovers from it (which he himself didn't think was appropriate for the film.) This film has apparently been re-edited several times, but no matter how many times they do, it will never be completely satisfying. What it needed was one more rewrite at the beginning, with development of one tiny element: the characters.We don't care about the replicants enough; because we don't know enough about them. We don't care about Harrison Ford's character enough, because he kills too soullessly, ""just doing his job"", and doesn't give it a second thought. Which brings me to the movie's biggest deficit: He has no character arc. He doesn't grow or change throughout the movie. Phillip K. Dick mentioned in a rare interview I'm glad I got to read, that he intended the replicants and the character of Deckard to undergo a reversal: the replicants become more human, with a conscience, by the end of the film, and Deckard becomes less and less human because of his actions, until their characters have completely switched. This would have given a satisfying and complete meaning to the film. All the replicants wanted to do was live, not be slaves and to be left alone for the remainder of their brief lives. All Deckard wanted to do was kill them, get paid and go home. No thought given to his actions afterwards.We learn nothing of the replicants' inner feelings except the main one, and then only peripherally. If they had been allowed to emote and to feel pain, we would have empathized with them and had a problem with Deckard killing them. So there really is no-one to empathize with, certainly not Ford, who plays a futuristic Charles Bronson character out of Deathwish, who killed muggers and punks with no emotion whatsoever.Possible Spoiler:One major quibble I have is with the murder of Sebastian, the one (and only) empathetic character out of the whole film. He acts as the unwilling host for two of the replicants, he comes to like them and they seem to like him, but after the head replicant kills Tyrell, the genius who bioengineered the replicants, he goes after Sebastian, and we hear later that the replicant killed him too. Why? This completely undermines the evolution of the replicant towards humanity. We can see why the replicant would kill his creator who created him to be a disposable slave who will die after four years, but a man who had helped him? It was a senseless contradiction and brought us back to square one about caring about the replicants. (Even with Darth Vader, the audience empathized with him a little, being scarred up and a victim of his destiny. He didn't just kill people randomly.)So, there we have it. The reason why, in my opinion, the movie will never be as great as it could be, because nothing changes, and we have no-one (and nothing) to really care about. At the end we're left with a film that creates a sense of mood, and not a moral or meaningful statement. That's too bad; it could have done all of that, with one more rewrite and ten minutes more of developing (i.e., evolving) the characters. Rutger Hauer's ""tears in the rain"" speech at the end unfortunately is not enough to accomplish that by itself.However, I doubt that Ridley Scott cares about any of that, as he endlessly re-edits the visuals in his film......"
hikerhetav,"Mar 20, 2021",7/10,"This was definitely ahead of time. Endeavouring to do something with the concepts of immortality, death, morbidity and consumerism, is definitely a good take on how Communism can be deadly in the modern context. The subjects like Marxist perspective on humans' lifespan and their productivity is very relatable in today's era when many nations have begun to try a hand at expansion of robots and their capability to protect human's lifespan. But the major issue is what if the manufacturers of robots do not envisage the actual lifespan of robots? Are humans capable of making immortal robots? If no, what are the chances that the future of robots will be possible even when humans will perish?More thematic discussion in next review."
barrygilbertjohnson,"Sep 22, 2021",10/10,A movie I didn't care for when it was released but became my favorite of all time over the years.
mkdropper,"Jun 29, 2022",7/10,"I neither think that this movie is a masterpiece or a piece of garbage. I jsut think this movie is ""good"".I kinda liked the what the movie is tryna tell us, but this not in the area of the movie, rather the book. So I can't take this as a criter.For an 80's movie, I think the cinematography is pretty good, it was elaborate. Not only the futurist scenes, also the inside ones with the puppets and so on. It does not expand my horizons but at least it didn't caught my eye too.I think the ""replica"" actors really nailed being a replica, as they find the perfect spot between a robot and a human, congrats to Rutger Hauer for this good performance.And that's it. Besides from how this movie affected the ""cyberpunk"" movie endustry it was a pretty good movie. Also it is kinda philosophical if you are fond of it."
james-3248,"Dec 16, 2011",1/10,"What a waste of time. 2 hours however long of my life wasted. I watched the directors cut and boy is it boring. Easily the most boring film i've seen since avatar. I personally love sci-fi films whether it be star wars or alien. My favourite book of all time is enders game. The film moves so slowly that I could feel my hair grow faster. There are literally 5 things that happen in the movie. People read way to far in this movie about how it's supposed to be about how the robots were more humans than the people, personally I believe that's a load of poppycock. When the original was released nobody went to see it, the original was cut and given a commentary for a reason, the film was too long, boring and doesn't make much sense. The commentary helped this film so much, it gave it a story and stops the watcher from having to make up some random story to stop themselves dosing off."
jack_o_hasanov,"Aug 27, 2021",10/10,"What a shame for a movie that was undervalued at its time. Fortunately, over time its value was realized. An excellent movie."
freethinkingworld,"Apr 25, 2023",9/10,"This movie is probably the film that I have the most complex feelings on. On a large scale this films seems like it's tailored for me, a grim sci-fy themed world with a New York type city and a heavy noir vibe with a banger soundtrack......yes please. But I don't know if I love it or not. And I can not tell you why I don't know. There is nothing especially bad or anything that turns me away. But I will say I haven't really looked into the symbolisms or the philosophical aspects of the films. I probably should look into this stuff, it will probably help my appreciation of it. But I will tell you what did help my appreciation of it for sure, was watching the cut that did not have Harrison Ford's terrible narration! If you read this and haven't heard it and think it would not be so bad, it is. This movie went up a full star without it on this recent rewatch. But the soundtrack is still freaking Amazing! It always stood out even on first watch! I love it so much!"
leewoodford,"Jul 27, 2021",9/10,"The sets, the atmosphere, music, story, acting, costumes, and special fx give this film a feel unlike any other and is still excites me to this day.They just don't make them like this anymore."
frankde-jong,"Dec 20, 2022",7/10,"After a somewhat hesitant start at the box office ""Blade runner"" has become a real classic film. There is an original release (1982), a directors cut (1991) and a final cut (2007).The theme in ""Blade runner"" is the question if robots can develop (human) emotions. This question ia closely linked with the discipline of Artificial Intelligence, and so ""Blade runner"" shares this theme with the film ""AI"" (2001, Steven Spielberg).There are however nuances in the way the two films elaborate on the theme. In ""Blade runner"" the emotion in question is survival instinct. In ""AI"" the emotion in question is love. This distinction has several consequences. ""AI"" is not only about the question if robots can love humans, but also if the other way round is possible. Because the robots in ""AI"" have a social function they have a different look from the robots in ""Blade runner"", which are more like production robots.In a broader sense there are more films that search for the characteristic element that makes human beings human. Often the answer is ""emotions"", such as in ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" (1956, Don Siegel) and ""Wings of desire (1987, Wim Wenders). In the first mentioned film angels are looking for human emotions, in the other film human beings are afraid to lose their emotions.It must be said however that ""emotions"" are a broad concept. We already came across meanings as ""survival instinct"" (""Blade runner"") and ""love"" (""AI""). In ""Wings of desire"" emotions are also used in the sense of ""love"", but in ""Invasion of the body snatchers"" we are talking about ""irrationality"".Earlier in this review I wrote about the robots in ""Blade runner"" being a kind of production robots. This points to another (sub)theme, being a society divided in the happy few (who consume) and the suppressed masses (who produce). In a film such as ""Metropolis"" (1927, Fritz Lang) the supressed masses are humans, in ""Blade runner"" they are robots."
Prince-P,"Mar 25, 2023",9/10,"After ""Alien"" became a global success, its director Ridley Scott was eager to do more sci-fi. He started on the blockbuster ""Dune"" but was forced to leave the production after a disagreement with its Italian producer. Instead, Scott planned to film ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" by cult writer Philip K Dick. If the director thought he was in for an easier job this time, he must have been disappointed.The movie follows a retired police officer (a so-called Blade Runner) who hunts down rogue androids who have illegally entered Earth.""Blade Runner"", as the film was renamed, became an unusually grueling affair. There are countless reports of the many on-set bad feelings that plagued the production. The star, Harrison Ford, didn't like his co-star Sean Young, and the film crew had T-shirts made to express their anger over the brutal shooting schedule. But the worst part was that Harrison Ford and Ridley Scott didn't get along. Ford has rarely commented on the matter since filming was completed, except to remark that it was the toughest movie he had ever worked on.Ridley Scott credits the French magazine ""Métal Hurlant"" as a stylistic mood source. Inspiration also came from the industrial landscape of his former hometown in northeast England. In addition, the picture has many similarities with Fritz Lang's masterpiece ""Metropolis"". In fact, Scott's effects supervisor used stills from the old silent movie when lining up the miniature building shots of ""Blade Runner"".With its mix of high tech and film noir, ""Blade Runner"" became a box office flop upon its initial run. But the picture soon gained a significant cult following that increased its stature. Today, it is often ranked as one of the most important and influential science fiction movies of all time. Along with William Gibson's novel ""Neuromancer"" the film is regarded as the initiator of the whole cyberpunk genre."
tonypeacock-1,"Feb 23, 2023",7/10,"I had to watch this film after trying to understand its sequel Blade Runner 2049 (2017). The film was released in 1982 but is based on a 1968 novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' Directed by Ridley Scott who brought the sci-fi film Alien to the big screen in 1979 it stars Harrison Ford as an cop Rick Deckard whose assignment is to hunt down and indeed retire 'replicants'. Human looking androids. Four have made it to earth and 2019 Los Angeles. So the film has visions of L. A. some thirty years into the future, around now at the time of viewing nearly (2017).Much like other films most notably Back To The Future II it envisages a world of hovering cars, neon, electronic advertising of big corporations like Piccadilly Circus and Times Square and a dark, rainy city. The art direction of the film is from an era when the dreaded CGI of the later Star Wars films hasn't arrived thankfully and makes full use of models and miniature effects.For anyone that has watched Alien you will know of the human looking android character. I suppose this film follows 'replicants' like that. Ford doesn't dominate the film. His co-stars include replicant Roy Batty (Rutger Hauer) and Sean Young. The nail in the coffin for the screenplay was Deckard falling in love with one of the androids. I found the film hard going. I'm not sci-fi weary as I like the early Star Wars films and indeed the latest releases but the dark vision of 2019 is depressing. I don't understand how this film has gathered such a cult following over the years. Apparently there is some debate over whether Deckard himself is a replicant. It sounds very negative but I'm not particularly interested.The religious symbolism of the film reminded me of another I saw recently Mother! (2017). Here the Batty replicant played by Hauer pierces his hand with a nail like the crucifixion? One positive when compared to its sequel Blade Runner 2049 is the 117m or so running time compared to a near three hour run time for the sequel film."
TomtheTom,"May 31, 2022",10/10,Probably his greatest work. I think he needs to receive all the praise in the world for contributing to the arresting mood and atmosphere of this film and its world. Can you imagine it with any other score?
Horror-yo,"Feb 15, 2017",7/10,"This film imposes a difficult exercise for the critic. On one hand, it depicts powerful concepts, but on the other hand as a film lacks quite a bit in terms of pace and content. So basically put, its narrative is greater than its own self. The film is a much, much lesser effort than the themes it depicts.Young Harrison Ford does alright, while Hauer (the villain) is decent as well but so much of this film is in the things it hints at rather than the things it actually actively does. Just Hauer himself is more a compelling character on an aesthetic level really.The scenery is superb in places, really very impressive stuff visually for a 1982 production. But as so often with Ridley Scott sci-fi's, we're given a lot of arty stuff, of the rarest more sophisticated kind, along with very deep philosophical themes... but his films seem to always have that discrepancy in pacing and in actually developing those themes. This film borders on the genius in what it scratches on, but never achieves that genius because of how linear the scenes are, how excessively paced down the development occurs, and simply, how much the film focuses on all other things but those philosophical themes.If you'd catch that film at any random point and watch on, you'd never think it was anything more than one of those hot crime type scifi's from the 80's. It's only towards the end we're revealed all the depth that was supposedly hiding in this work. But it's too late by then. A film with such conceptual density needs to, while still maintaining subtlety in execution, make it clear what it's about. Instead, we're really given a succession of scenes with little actual value in themselves: a common, linear body of sequences with ordinary, underwhelming events happening. The fight scenes are long and often in bad taste, most scenes are in themselves totally forgettable, and what really is praised in this one is the narrative and philosophical implications from the very end, so not the film itself but what it talks about.So that's watching a full two hours of very ordinary, highly paced sci-fi, for just the one powerful scene at the end with the big quotes and all the poetry. It's totally underwhelming in light of what's put in the works. An artisan/craftsman needs to make his works shine and highlight its most precious qualities, not conceal or smother them while other aspects completely dominate the equation.As trivia, this is a film that's influenced the band Fear Factory enormously, the band quoting many moments like: ""I want more life - it's too bad she won't live... but then again who does - that's what it is to be slaved""... and one must pay tribute to the use of the then very modern synth-based atmospheric soundtrack and how it mixes so well with the blueish/metallic overtone on the visuals, with the rain at the end and that poetic, genuinely deep moment. ""Our memories, like tears in the rain"".As an ultimate philosophical ideal, this film is profoundly nihilistic. It's clearly saying man and machine are virtually the same thing so long as they are merely as intelligent, so long as they are sentient beings with memories. So no place for the soul, or a god. Organic=artificial, and there's no profound meaning to life.The other thing is this film has an interesting twist, but again, does little in the way of clarity there.A sympathy 7/10."
alekspredator87,"Aug 3, 2022",9/10,"It is difficult to overestimate the epochal creation from the famous director Ridley Scott called ""Blade Runner"". This is now a well-established fiction that has passed the test of time and over a long history has won the favor of viewers around the world, besides revealing the birth of a whole direction, which is now commonly called cyberpunk.Taking as a basis the well-known novel by Philip K. Dick ""Do androids dream of electroovtsy?"" Sir Ridley supplemented the work, substantially reworked it, breathing something new into his picture. This film was imbued with the atmosphere of the decline of the future, the dominance of various technological innovations, which at the same time, it seems to me, absolutely did not bring joy to people. Society vegetates in a monstrous world of consumption, where a person and his personality are lost among a large crowd. Scott perfectly conveys the atmosphere of an authentic future, playing superbly with dark tones, and tells his story through the prism of a society falling into decline.The genre that was born thanks to this picture is now recognized thanks to the noticeable features of this film. The world here is presented in the form of a night city with the presence of numerous bright neon colors, a lot of advertising signs, frequent rains. Here you will be met by futuristic, but angular cars that fly right in the clouds, corporations rule the world, and artificial people can meet among the inhabitants of the planet. They're replicants.The main character, played by Harrison Ford, will have to face a group of them. He is a representative of a special squad called Blade Runners, who are fighting the appearance of replicants on Earth,. And his mission is to find several dangerous representatives of artificial people in order to prevent their existence on our planet. Ford's hero named Rick Deckard will do this with special interest for observation. The script and direction of the project allow you to plunge into the authentic world of the night metropolis, which is as familiar to everyone living in it as it is just as dangerous for them.The film poses a lot of questions to the audience, the main one of which boils down to drawing a line between real people and artificial ones. The topic is not new and even popular for that time. But, like any author, Philip K. Dick and Ridley Scott, who filmed this book masterpiece, answer this question in their own way.What is the role of man in this world? And who are the replicants? The latter are the offspring of the former, but how different are they? Where is the line between them, because everyone has their own consciousness, memory, and, as I think, feelings. It will be difficult to answer, each viewer will decide for himself which verdict will be right for him.An important heroine, played by Sean Young, will help the viewer and the main character to understand this issue. Her Rachel is shrouded in mystery, she is a special heroine who allows you to better understand this world of people and replicants.The film is complex and viscous. You drown in it, it seems long and slow. However, now, it would seem, these losing moments have become the hallmark of the work. The general plans of a dark city, towering pillars of fire somewhere in the distance, electronic sad music, like the sounds of loneliness of everyone and everyone in this huge metropolis - all this conveys the atmosphere of Scott's work.For this world, as if such wonderful actors as Rutger Hauer, Harrison Ford, Sean Young, Daryl Hannah, Bryon James and others appeared to the world as a selection. A great hit for everyone, the creation of unique and memorable characters.The picture will definitely make you think about the place of a person in the modern world and the future world of the future. Who will live next to us, how will we treat them, will the new artificial creatures pose a threat to people? There are a lot of questions that are quite difficult to answer.But I will never forget that monologue of Rutger Hauer's hero in the finale, his tears in the rain: ""I saw things that you people never dreamed of. Attacking ships blazing over Orion; Si rays cutting through the darkness at the gates of Tannhauser. All these moments will be lost in time, like... tears in the rain... It's time to die.""It seems that this is the quintessence of the whole work, when not only Deckard will rethink the familiar reality, but the audience along with him.7 out of 10."
kenntwohlkeiner,"Jan 12, 2022",10/10,"My favorite film. I didn't use to have a favorite film and this was just one of my favorites, but then I thought about it and this movie has Ridley Scott, Harrison Ford, great sets, it's Sci-Fi, unconventional Romance, some gore, great music, incredibly quotable, one famous add-lip, great world building."
penelopepoczuda,"Nov 5, 2025",6/10,"Some films grab you by the heart, others by the brain - and some grab you by the cinematography. For me, Blade Runner fell into the third category. Visually, it's a spectacle: buildings that seem to suck the sky dry and exhale smoke like weary lungs, neon signs that blink like electric hearts, flying cars we dream of riding in. Everything is beautiful, everything is grand - and perhaps for that very reason, it's the kind of spectacle that fills the eyes but leaves the heart a little empty.It's curious, because you can feel the weight of every aesthetic choice. Ridley Scott built an entire world and threw the viewer into it - a decadent, dirty, yet hypnotic future. And yet, something in me remained on the outside. It's that experience you know should hit you, but the impact just never came. I understand the fascination the film inspires: the philosophical questions, the metaphors about what it means to be human, the melancholic beauty of replicants who just want to live longer. It's all there, and it's all grand. It's just that, for me, something didn't click.Perhaps I am, I confess, the kind of viewer who likes to be invited into the story, not just to contemplate its design. As I watched, I found myself imagining another version - a more classic, more generic one, where the hunter falls in love with the replicant and decides to run away with her. The two of them being hunted, running through rain-soaked alleys, streets covered in Japanese signs, buildings abandoned by God. Something driven more by emotion, sweat, and contradiction. There's something irresistible about that idea: the hunter who spares the prey and becomes the new target. But Blade Runner prefers silence to chase, gaze to action, thought to passion.Part of this distance, I think, comes from Deckard himself. He's the typical noir protagonist: solitary, cynical, a killing machine. And the script is brilliant in inverting the roles - the replicants have more humanity than the man hunting them. This irony is what makes the film so interesting, but also what keeps me at arm's length. Deckard carries out his mission without hesitation, as if he were just another cog in the machine, and perhaps that's why I can never fully latch onto his journey. In the end, the moments of life, the flashes of emotion, come from the replicants. Roy Batty, for instance, has such an intense presence that I wanted more time with him, more lines, more space. His final monologue - ""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe..."" - is pure poetry from someone who knows they are about to die but still wants to leave a trace. ""All those moments will be lost in time, like tears in rain,"" as he says. And it's beautiful, truly. But I confess: I felt more respect than emotion. I understand the metaphor, but I don't drown in it.Perhaps Blade Runner didn't touch me because, in trying to speak about humanity, it ended up reminding me how hard it is to find it. I understand its acclaim: it's a landmark, it shaped the imagination of science fiction, it created an aesthetic and a philosophy that still echo today. But for me, it's like a city seen from above - I admire the lights, the rhythm, the architecture. I just didn't find the warmth of a lit window. In the end, Blade Runner is about artificial beings who desire to live longer. I, watching it, desired to feel more. Perhaps that is my truth facing it: a fascination that didn't turn into love, a beauty that didn't turn into emotion - a tear that, for some reason, never fell."

Henny-mj,"Aug 19, 2024",9/10,"For me this is the one true Blade Runner film, so many great things were happening for this one. It was the nineteen eighties and Harrison Ford was in his prime and Daryl Hannah was in her prime, the cinematography and music and set design all came together beautifully to form this brilliant spectacle. Personally I consider this to be Ridley Scott's best and greatest work and one of the best motion pictures of the eighties. They made a sequel and they tried to recapture some of that same magic but it simply did not work, the right ingredients were not there and it was merely an attempt to recreate something that could not be repeated."
SoumikBanerjee1996,"Mar 15, 2023",7/10,"This is how you construct an environment, that is how you transform your wildest imaginations into tangible reality. I was totally engrossed in Ridley's fictional world from start to finish.All of those magnificent visuals, along with the outstanding art direction and set designs create an enticing atmosphere that is hard to escape. The temptation will only intensify after you add some compelling sound design to that mixture.Although there is a possibility of a potential setback when it boils down to the writing or its screenplay for that matter. The first two acts are fine in my opinion, but the third act really let me down, it neither lived up to my expectations nor could it deliver on its previously made promises.There was something amiss in the climax!"
bananaguy42,"Jul 7, 2013",1/10,"I love Harrison Ford. I had very high expectations with this movie. The future, robots that look like humans, futuristic city, flying cars. And it has an 8.3 rating. I cannot explain how overrated this movie is. The movie does not explain anything about what is happening. The entire first quarter of the movie is Harrison Ford walking around extremely confused. There is very little action in this movie and the false opinion that the movie reveals something about ""human nature"" or ""the human mind"" is plain wrong. If you are a hardcore science fiction person, action person, or any human being that has ever lived, you will hate this movie. Half way through the movie, Harrison ford drops everything he's doing to practically rape one of the robots. I was only thirty minutes in when I wanted to turn it off but I'm glad I stayed until the ending because I have found the most over rated film in the history of science fiction"
helloamazon,"Dec 18, 2019",10/10,"I can only repeat what others have written already: ""A Milestone Of Science Fiction And A Cyberpunk Masterpiece ""Visually stunning for a movie made in the early 80s, the movie covers deep philosophical questions facing humanity in the 21st century (mega-corporations ruling over gig economy workers, environmental destruction, genetic engineering...) and what it means to be human.In short: A Timeless classic.The movie may feel a bit slow for today's audience but it's worth giving the plot time to unfold and to pick up the details (especially the gorgeous visuals, the visual overload almost requires a second or even a third viewing).If you watch(ed) other SF films released post-1982, including many Anime and music videos, you will see the huge influence Blade Runner had on character designs and settings.I will go even further: Blade Runner (it's worth repeating that it was released back in 1982 already) still feels very ahead of its time even decades later and is one of three most influential SF movies of all time in my opinion, along with:Metropolis (1927)2001: A Space Odyssey (1968)Add the first Star Wars movie from 1977 and the original Matrix movie (1999) if you want a list of five movies with two more successful (in terms of box office) works. Or swap these two additions for niche movies such as La Jetée (1962) or Brazil (1985) if you want to exclude blockbuster/mainstream examples.PS: Watch both the original theatrical release (1982) and then the Final Cut (released in 2007) of Blade Runner to find out which one suits you better (in this order). Finally, I also recommend the sequel Blade Runner 2049 released in 2017. Make sure you don't skip the three short films as an introduction to the sequel, sort of a story bridge from the original Blade Runner:2036: Nexus Dawn (2017)2048: Nowhere to Run (2017)Blade Runner Black Out 2022 (2017)These three short films are available for free online and are also included in many disc releases of Blade Runner 2049."
FlorisV,"Nov 3, 2008",9/10,"How this film has been underrated when it came out (mediocre, dull etc)!This is one of the very few films I like to re-watch from time to time. Ultimately this is not something I do for the story. Although I sometimes find new content here and there, things I missed the first time, the major reason to re-watch films like this is:-the astounding visuals (watch it in High Definition and be amazed, factor 10);-the music, I love Vangelis' unique soundtrack because he managed to make jazzy/bluesy synth music;-the atmosphere. Sure, it's all been done before, the film noir routine, but here it engages without being too formulaic.The philosophical themes are interesting too providing plenty of questions if you are interested. Mostly: what does it mean to be human? For instance, watch Rachel cry when she finds out she's not human after all. It evokes a form of pity, because, is she really that different from us? Isn't she worthy of a normal life? Aren't we all machines in a way, following the written routines in our own DNA code? Lack of empathy makes the replicants different from humans, but only for older models. And they get more human by the day. When they get too human they expire...the 4 year lifespan. But like any life form, they want survival. More even, to get the maximum out of the whole experience called life. Human after all?If you're not interested in such questions, this is still a beautiful film for the unequaled visuals, music, atmosphere and acting.I like the simple, original romantic ending, it's less ambiguous than the director's cut and I didn't mind the voice over at all. The director s cut has a completely different climax which is maybe less satisfying but stimulates much more thinking. Both versions endings are good and deserve recognition (particularly the original version has been bashed too much).The film is also better than the book though some would disagree. The book fails in truly capturing the atmosphere of a future where most living things are mechanical because it's one of Dick's less efficient books with a very forgettable ending. As much as I like his tales, his ideas usually outshine his writing. The film has much more atmosphere and tension."
ArmandoManuelPereira,"Apr 12, 2020",8/10,"When I first watched the Final Cut, I felt that it diminished the entertainment value of the original theatrical release. So I gave it 7/10. Afterwards, I read some reviews and comparative analysis, then watched it a 2nd time the next day. When I did, I had to agree that it was the superior version. So my rating bumped up. Otherwise, the film is what its always been. Remarkably aesthetic, with great camera work. In addition it possesses one of the most beautiful romantic moments I have seen in any movie. (I am referring to Dekkards wooing of Rachel after she has played the piano.) I admit that a few scenes tend to clog up the flow of the narrative (in my humble opinion), but not enough to lessen the overall enjoyment of the film."
bob the moo,"Oct 29, 2001",N/A,"Ridley Scott's horrific future-vision of Alien was a landmark in cinema. Blade Runner keeps his trademark bleak city vision and opens it up with questions of existences in a detective thriller.  The Director's Cut adds a whole new element that many people suspected from the original but makes it clear that this is what we're meant to think.The visuals and the score in the film are excellent and for me make the whole thing work.  Ford and Penn are good in their roles, but Rutgar Hower is excellent as the lead android making this one of his best performances - who doesn't know his final speech almost verbatim by now?!  Ford's wooden style fits in well with the cold city that he lives in and also lends itself to the fact that Ford may not be everything he seems.This is the version that we should have seen years ago - it allows us to follow the story ourselves without the voiceover having to lead us by the hand.  The main addition of Ford's unicorn dreams opens up a whole new element to the film and throws up plenty to talk about once it is finished. A beautiful looking film that, thanks to this cut, has plenty of substance to match the visual flair."
philipambrose-91,"Jul 5, 2022",7/10,"Good entertainment. As I'm sure everybody knows there are several versions of the film, my comments are based on the original UK release. This is a prime example of neo-noir cinema with its consistently dark setting, lots of smoking and Harrison Ford's world-weary voice over. Ford plays Deckard, a Blade Runner who's job is to hunt down artificial people known as replicants who used as off world slave labour but aren't permitted on Earth. A group of them have returned and are trying to find their creator. Initially we don't know why they have returned but soon learn that they were built to last only four years and as their time is running out they seek a way to fix themselves.In his pursuit of them he is sent to see the head of the Tyrell corporation, who had designed the replicants. Here Deckard is introduced to Tyrell's assistant Rachael who unbeknownst to her is also a replicant who has been implanted with false memories. When she learns what she is she seeks Deckard again to discover what he knows.When the film starts we know that Deckard is clearly the hero of the film and the replicants, lead by Roy Batty played by Rutger Hauer are the villains but as the film progresses that idea becomes less certain. After all all they want is a life that isn't artificially shortened.The acting from Ford and Sean Young, as Rachael is very good but it is Rutger Hauer who steals the show as the enigmatic Batty, his finally speech is one of the great film speeches. I'd recommend this to all fans of science fiction, especially for people who like them set in a dystopian future."
thomaspaton-96985,"Dec 16, 2018",10/10,One of the only films of its kind. Blade Runner is one of my all-time favourite movies!
JamesHitchcock,"Aug 4, 2011",10/10,"""Blade Runner"" is, together with the original version of ""Planet of the Apes"", my favourite science-fiction film. The two films ask diametrically opposed questions of fundamental philosophical importance. That posed by ""Planet of the Apes"" is ""What distinguishes humans from animals?""; that posed by ""Blade Runner"" is ""What distinguishes humans from machines?""The film is set in the year 2019. In 1982 that doubtless seemed a long way away, but in 2011 we can see it as yet another sci-fi film which greatly overestimated the speed of technological progress. Fortunately, the quality of science fiction movies is not always dependent on their ability to foretell the future. The central idea of the film is that science has perfected organic robots called replicants, virtually indistinguishable from adult humans, the one difference being that replicants (supposedly) lack emotions. Replicants may only be used for dangerous or menial work in outer space or on other planets; their use on Earth is forbidden. Nevertheless, replicants have been known to defy the ban and return to Earth, where they are hunted down and killed (or ""retired"" to use the official euphemism) by a special police squad known as ""Blade Runners"".The main character is Rick Deckard, a Blade Runner assigned the task of ""retiring"" four returned replicants hiding in Los Angeles. In order to prevent them from developing human emotions, the life-span of replicants is limited to four years, and it is believed that these four have come to earth to force the Tyrell Corporation, which manufactured them, to extend their lives. Another important element in the plot is a romance between Deckard and Rachael, a beautiful young woman whom he later discovers to be a secret replicant. Unlike the other replicants we see in the film, Rachael is a more advanced model who believes herself to be human, having had artificial memories implanted into her mind.Despite its science-fiction theme, ""Blade Runner"" can also be regarded as belonging to the neo-noir genre. Like other neo-noirs from this period, such as ""Chinatown"", ""Body Heat"" and ""Gorky Park"", it has a very distinctive visual style. The city we see is very futuristic, complete with towering buildings and flying cars, and yet for all its high-tech buildings, the Los Angeles of 2019 is a gloomy, rainswept city disfigured by litter, graffiti and poverty, a literal and metaphorical City of Dreadful Night. The atmosphere is reminiscent of 1940s noirs such as ""The Big Sleep"", also set in a dark, rainy Los Angeles, although it is said that director Ridley Scott also drew on his roots in the industrial North-East of England. Since 1982 this dark, moody look has become something of a cliché in science-fiction, horror and superhero movies, but in its day it marked a radical alternative to the bright, gleaming ""Star Wars"" vision of the future.Another typically noir element in the film is the character of Deckard, a disillusioned, world-weary detective of the type who, had the film been made thirty or forty years earlier, would undoubtedly have been played by Humphrey Bogart. Harrison Ford was already known to the public as Han Solo in ""Star Wars"" and Indiana Jones; ""Blade Runner"" was perhaps the film that first revealed him as an intelligent, thoughtful actor as well as an action hero. This, together with ""Witness"" and ""The Fugitive"", is probably his best performance. Sean Young is an actress who has largely disappeared from view in recent years, but in the eighties she was a rising star, and here she gives her one really memorable performance as Rachael, the woman who has to cope with the knowledge that everything she has hitherto believed about herself is a lie. Rachael's hairstyle is a deliberately old-fashioned one, possibly in order to suggest another link with forties film noir. (Sean is one of several female actors of her generation to be known by a male forename; another, Daryl Hannah, appears as one of the four escaped replicants).The third great performance comes from Rutger Hauer as the replicant Roy. Hauer, who is Dutch, speaks English fluently, but with a slight foreign accent, and this is put to good use in the film to suggest a being almost identical to, and yet subtly different from, the human characters. (Rachael's rather formal speech has a similar effect). Roy is believed to be a dangerous, alien being, yet as the film progresses it becomes clear that he and his fellow replicants are fully human souls with their own personalities who have developed in full the emotions they were not supposed to share.A key scene comes near the end, where Roy stretches out his hand to prevent Deckard from falling to his death. This scene called to mind Michelangelo's famous painting of God creating Adam, but reverses its meaning. Deckard is a member of the race which created Roy, and therefore a metaphorical ""god"", but here it is the created being who stretches out his hand to his creator and thereby confers the gift of life on him. In this moving scene we see that the replicants are every bit as capable as humans- if not more so- of experiencing the emotions of pity and compassion.The film initially performed poorly at the box office, but later became recognised as a classic, especially after a ""director's cut"" was released in 1992. (I must admit that I never saw the original version that was released in cinemas; my comments are based upon the director's cut and the more recent ""final cut""). Scott is said to regard ""Blade Runner"" as his most complete and personal film; I would regard it as his finest. There is not enough space here to do justice to all its complexities and shades of meaning, but it must count as one of the best films of the eighties and one of the most intelligent and profound science-fiction films of all time. 10/10"
Coxer99,"Jul 13, 1999",7/10,"Fantastic sci-fi thriller about a mission to eliminate genetically engineered humans of superior strength and intelligence. Hauer is brilliant as one of these engineered humans whom ""blade runner,"" Ford is trying to put a stop to. Touches of great film noir, coupled with dazzling effects, cinematography and an effective musical score by Vangelis."
jcarlos-96740,"Jun 19, 2022",3/10,"Heading to the new Blade Runner movie I finally decided to watch the first movie. What a massive disappointment it was. This movie is all looks and zero substance, there is no script, no character development nor interest in the characters, just dark scenes, lots of rain and some boring and dull action scenes.The pace is extremely slow and the story is so simple that the movie could've been much shorter, it is only this big because all they wanted to do was to show you this world that they created, and thats the main problem with this movie, more focused on visuals than substance, they created the story to go along with the world but should've been the other way around.The only reason I rate it 3/10 its due the production and visual impact that this movie had, because otherwise this would be a straight 1/10."
TheBillionthGuyNamedJack,"Apr 14, 2020",10/10,"Even before the plot kicks in, Blade Runner's strangely beautiful neon sci-fi images make this an instant masterpiece. Blade Runner's philosophical plot aligns with it's appealing visuals focusing on how even the smallest things in life are fascinating. Even the most fantastic imagery comes from some of the most basic things, such as smoke from a cigarette glimmering in sunlight. In Blade Runner, Earth has become numb to such a dazzling gift life is, which allows a deeper exploration through Harrison Ford's well preformed slowly realizing Rick Deckard and Rutger Bauer's Roy Batty. It may take a little bit to realize if you lose focus, but Blade Runner is a grimly majestic film that will make you appreciate the little things in life."
vinnieboards,"May 20, 2011",10/10,"It must be quietly disconcerting for Ridley Scott that he directed his greatest film in the early 80's with the knowledge that try as he does, he will always find it difficult to improve upon. I watched this masterpiece of a film first time out and loved it from the start - in fact, it's not only my favourite sci-fi film but one of my favourites of all time.Whilst everyone is entitled to an opinion, I do find it laughable that some members of the IMDb community can give this classic a 1 star rating. Many conclude that the film does not live up to the expectations of the book. This of course is a nonsensical argument – the mental images derived from a book cannot be realistically compared to the reality of pictures on the silver screen. Everybody's interpretation is different. In other cases, the deep meaning and natural intelligence of Bladerunner appear to be too much for some. May I suggest these people look under the sections for Steve Seagal and Chuck Norris!These inane comments cannot detract from what is a groundbreaking piece of cinema. In a post apocalyptic Los Angeles where acid rain drenches the city from the gloomy sky above and people who can afford it search for the salvation of off world colonies, we enter the world of the Bladerunner – a specialist law enforcer tasked with the termination of human replicants who have turned 'rogue'.Not an easy task when considering that the human clones in question are difficult to distinguish from the real article. And in Rick Deckard's case (Harrison Ford), the task is to prove all the more difficult as the 'skinjobs' in question start to develop their own feelings and emotions for the first time.Bladerunner is a landmark film because unlike many sci-fi epics, it has stood the test of time. Made only 5 years after the original Star Wars film, the movie has aged incredibly well and looks as fresh and modern now as it did in 1982. More remarkably the film was made before the onset of computer aided graphics, which provides a fitting testament to how well this film is made. Star Wars: A New Hope looks dated – Bladerunner does not.The bleakness of the sets, the quirky dialogue and even quirkier film score by Vangellis, all add together to make a first rate sci-fi thriller which gets better the more times you watch it. Rutger Hauer provides the stand out performance as Roy Batty, the leader of the malfunctioning group, who is a ruthless killer by trade but famously shows compassion for the first time just before he dies as his emotions evolve.The film delves into a number of thought provoking topics including one which has troubled humanity since the beginning of time – how long have we got? Do you want to know or would you rather not? And in our world where genetic modification is raising questions in the medical sector, Bladerunner also poses this same question but some 20 years earlier. Regardless of whether you watch the original or Directors Cut version, this movie stands out as filmmaking of the highest calibre with a realism that everyone can identify with. Watch it in BlueRay for the experience this film deserves.Time to Die? In Bladerunner's case I think not. It'll still look good in 2111."
Screen_Blitz,"May 15, 2016",9/10,"Ridley Scott's cyberpunk thriller Blade Runner inspired by the short novel by Phillip K. Dick is a film with a reputation that grew following its trouble history with its studio. The debacle started with Scott facing studio interference that lead to re-edits that neither him or lead star Harrison Ford were satisfied with, especially with its dour performance at the box office. The ordeal was followed with re-edits that made their way into the Director's Cut Edition released on home media ten years later. However, it wasn't until Scott polished with the film with a final makeover, renovating the picture to his most satisfying form known as the Final Cut in 2007. What comes of the final product is a stylish futuristic sci-fi piece showing the director operating at arguably his finest fashion. Scorching with a dazzlingly rich visual heft and narrative that breathes a chock load of ambition. It is blistering sci-fi spectacle blooming with elements that have carried influence on many cyberbunk entries in later years including 'Dark City', 'Ghost in The Shell', and 'The Matrix' to name of few. Now that is a definition of a groundbreaking picture. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a local police officer in the futuristic city of Los Angeles in 2019, a city rattled by crime and economic depression. Deckerd is assigned to a daunting task of assassinating four emotionless androids known as Replicants. These otherworldly beings are humanoids who are disguised as regular humans. And the worst part, they happen to be responsible for the theft a spaceship. When he closes in the leader of the group Rachael (played by Seana Young), the only one born with emotion, Deckerd begins to question his identity.In age when science-fiction was the household for mainly aliens, intergalactic warfare, and post-apocalyptic settings; Blade Runner offered something not entirely seminal but highly underpopulated in the genre, and expanded upon it with ideas not many, if any, filmmakers dared to attempt before. This is where the visionary mind of Ridley Scott is poured into with no restraint of ambition. Set in a futuristic society completed with an eye-dazzling visual design that many (especially back in the day of its initial release) could describe as groundbreaking, the film transpires with a plot stitched together with a plethora of twists and turns that leave audiences' head throbbing with questions of Deckard's identity. Is he the man he always believed he is, or is there a secret hidden within his transparent being? As the events unfold into a steadily paced game of cat-and-mouse with sudden bursts of intense gunplay, conspiracy permeates the grim atmosphere to the point where the most intriguing elements lie not within the questions that are answered but the ones that are left unanswered. The story, uprooted marvelously from the script by Hampton Fancher and David Peoples, is handled with grace and moves at pace that may prove to be too sluggish for some, but nonetheless allows the for the characters to build and for the plot to bulk up for the cutthroat climax. If you grab a hold of the Final Cut edition, you avoid the unnecessary Harrison Ford narration that bears seemingly no significant purpose. And as for Ford, fresh from his debut in the 'Indiana Jones' franchise', the actor puts on a performance that is more than desirable. There is a fair steam of charisma smoking through his performance. Sean Young remains solid in her role, but nothing that knocks for sheer impression. She just does enough to show she is talented and fitting for the role.Blade Runner is a profoundly engaging cyberpunk piece that broke many grounds for establishing powerful elements that have inspired many entries of the genre today. And the accomplished ambition of Ridley Scott's directorial methodology is what holds the film as one of the most influential sci-fi flicks of its generation. Now that is a fine achievement for a film uprooted from a tortured history."
mrtimlarabee,"Dec 12, 2007",10/10,"I think I've owned 3 different versions of this film at one time and can finally 'retire' my old versions after being dished the final cut alongside the versions I grew up with.To be fair, the first version I saw of this was on home video and included the now infamous voice overs and happy ending. I loved that version. Given, Harrison Ford's voice over sounds like he wasn't taking the ordeal too seriously, it unintentionally provided another layer for the movie.One of the things that stood out in Ridley Scott's vision of the future was how America was more than a melting pot, it was a blur of images of past, present, future and a blur of culture and ethnicity. In a word, it was a blur of identity. The voice-over, love it or hate it, always gave an almost non-time feel to the movie, combining old fashioned detective film noir to a gloomy, messy future. Looking back, many of the narrations feel silly, but it still added an additional layer to the film.Looking forward, the director's cut creates a different film. That idea of identity is further explored as the lack of narration makes Deckard's thoughts more ambiguous as his own identity is questioned. This version always created a sense of isolation and curiosity. Ridley Scott's vision seems more authentic.I always loved the non-CGI visual effects of the film, which still hold up to this day (if you don't believe that, then do not wait for the 5 disc DVD - rush to a city showing it on the big screen). In the early 80s, sci fi films were popular and while many were experimenting with new technologies, a lot of Blade Runner is old fashioned models, which blow away ANY CGI (note to George Lucas, Robert Zemekis and all cgi aficionados everywhere). The sets were great - the muddled future, looking like a New York Nightmare.But the simple story is what still stands out. Brushed off as a gloomy search and destroy pic in its original release, viewers now see the questions the film raises about humanity and identity, perhaps also raising eyebrows about how it all fits into science. The acting was always top notch, notably from Rutger Hauer who appears first as a classic villain but shows much more depth in his limited screen time. He's also got the best dialogue.Whatever version you watch of Blade Runner, you're always in for a classic. The vision of this film is unprecedented and something about it remains fresh 25 years on. If you haven't seen it - watch it now. If you have, watch it again. There's always something new to discover about this classic."
drpainters,"Oct 9, 2021",7/10,"Plenty of cool elements, but I just don't get it really. Feel like it's more of a nostalgic watch if you enjoyed it in the day. Not big fan and don't watch it frequently or look to upgrade my BluRay to 4k or whatever will be next."
vaultoverseer_15,"Oct 21, 2017",10/10,"Some People see this film as overrated, and boring. To be honest, I can see where they are coming from. If you want to see a good review from someone who explains exactly why they don't like it, watch RedLetterMedia's Re:View of Blade Runner. I can see the criticisms, but to me the movie is a masterpiece, and in a way its flaws makes it a masterpiece. To me the general slow pace make the film immerse you into Los Angeles, and despite its obvious exaggerations, this future feels real. The slow pace also establishes the beauty of this modern world, established through impressive cinematography, Vangelis's great soundtrack and of course the special effects. This is by far one of the best looking films of all time, and personally that look is really able to draw me in where the film might bore others. Some argue the story and characters are what hold this film back, however I would disagree. No one argues that Rutger Hauer's performance is bad, but many have problems with Harrison Ford's Deckard. To me, he is a sad depressed man who drinks, and abuses women. It's more subtle, and we can see that Rachel in the film probably doesn't like him at all, but just needs to find refuge. The whole replicant/human discussion is definitely interesting, and I won't spoil anything for someone who hasn't seen the film so they discover the debate for themselves. Honestly I don't have a clear idea, the movie works either way, but I am still not sure. Hopefully 2049 doesn't answer the question for me. Blade Runner is one of the greatest sci fi films ever made, and to me it changed the face of cinema and sci fi films forever."
Smells_Like_Cheese,"Mar 26, 2007",7/10,"I have heard quite a bit about Blade Runner lately, from a friend, on TV, my movie book, and my mom, so I wanted to see what all the fuss was about, so I rented it and just watched it tonite and I have to say that this was a very strange and disturbingly beautiful film. My only problem with it, is that it was just the more expensive Terminator in some ways. But I did enjoy the story, despite how weird it was, it is a film I haven't really seen. I loved the effects, it just amazes me how realistic they were compared to today's technology, not to mention the moral of the story still needs to be recognized in today's society.In the year 2019, we have created a type of machine, looks and acts like a human, only they are stronger and smarter, they are called Replicants. But due to a violent act they are forbidden from entering planet Earth; 4 replicants have made it to Earth and want their lives expanded from 4 years to so many more. Rick Deckard, a retired Blade Runner, rejoins the force to stop these replicants, but ends up realizing who might be the true enemy.It's very interesting and very visually stunning, but I wasn't incredibly impressed, at least with all the hype I heard with it. I can understand why, because it was a huge break through for the time, but still for me, I enjoy the Terminator films when it comes to a futuristic robot film. But I would never not recommend this movie, just for the sake that you can say you saw it, and you never know, I think you'll give it a proud 10, but I'm going to stick with my rating.7/10"
GeorgeI4280,"Apr 8, 2022",5/10,"As I did not see this movie in its prime but did see Blade Runner 2049 in theatres before ever seeing the first film it could play a factor in my opinion. Now the version I saw was The Final Cut I haven't seen the theatrical release or directors cut version. However the film story seemed very straight forward A Blade Runner must kill all Replicants and as a Detective essentially he goes about his assignment. I am not a Harrison Ford fan by any means I like Star Wars & Indiana Jones but this was a solid performance from Forward. He definitely captures the character very well.However I felt even for a under 2 hour movie this felt like a dull drag. I was intrigued at first and then slowly it began to kind of drag on and I felt somewhat losing interest. I am a huge fan of indie films and strange films but this film just didnt vibe with me.When the we get to the final act and the final face off if you will the way The Final Cut decides to wrap up felt so underwhelming. I do not always need an epic action filled ending but the way this wraps up just left me with ""That's it?"".The pros of this film is Fords performance and the special effects for its time was seriously impressive. The world they take into gives you typical film noir with a sci-fi flare. The world itself feels like a character on its own. But ultimately the delivery, pacing, and story just does not meet the expectations especially with the hype and fan base behind this film. Again I couldve been because I watched Blade Runner 2049 first, I waited too long to see it, or maybe I watched the wrong version for myself. But I wasn't entertained enough to watch the other 2 versions to find out."
moopie,"Oct 31, 2001",10/10,"Director's cut rules! It's been 20 years since this movie was made, and by far, it is still one of the best films ever. Wisely, no cheesy special effects were used, which could have dated the film. The wardrobe and architecture are a combination of the 1930's, 40's, 50's and beyond, which give it the timeless look that enables us to see the future. There is not one weak performance, and the casting was impeccable. The direction, the vision, the script, the soundtrack, art direction, and casting - all exemplary.Other films have come after it, but this one set the bar so high it has yet to be surpassed.A great short story, (Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep, Phillip K. Dick), and a great film."
tfduckman,"Nov 6, 2006",10/10,"... actually I have to admit that I also love the first one with Harrison Fords Voice Over !I don't mind the Marlowe-/Chandler-element and I think Ford hits a""wonderfull cliché-filled worn-out Noir-style"",even if the explanatory commentary was ""forced"" upon Ford & Ridley Scott (Or not ?).I think people should see the ""pop""-edition before the ""Director's Cut"" (which is now being re-cut from the beginning by Ridley for release in 2007) because this ""voice-over""-edition made a lot of the world realize that ScienceFiction is a way of telling essential stories, though maybe not the so-called cultural ""elite"" !And the Directors Cut - 10 years later in 1992 - came too late for the masses; who by now, felt that the story of another successful SciFi-movie-masterpiece *) : ""The Lawnmower Man"" (becoming the Cyber God) was getting just as close to the human mind and as personal as the PC (Personal Computer)!*)= Inspired by ""Flowers for Algernon""Of course I adore, love & respect the philosophical dramas of ""2001"" and ""Solaris"" laying the path to the moral Startrek-universe as well as the true pop-phenomenon of StarWars; BUT I remember the effect the voice-over-edition (of BladeRunner) had on people. They couldn't shake it of, because this movie embodies what we sci-fi-READERS (and I read almost 100 % of the danish sci-fi-books around 1980) wants all NON-scifians to see :This genre is about YOU and how the elements of the universe interact with You - understood by knowledge in our minds - but felt strangely as a reality in Your heart."
gannonczaicki,"Mar 11, 2021",8/10,"The story is a little bit hard to follow, but all the other things this movie offers make up for it. The world they created for this movie, is one of the most immersive worlds I've seen in a film. You can easily imagine the daily life of anyone in that city. Don't even get me started on the special effects. This movie is almost 40 YEARS old! I only wish I saw it back then, so I would be even more blown away."
jancyclops,"Jan 5, 2002",7/10,"Yes, it's a good film and I enjoy watching it.  Yes, I have watched it many times and have never gone out of my way to avoid it.  But it only has half the plot of DADOES and misses out an awful lot of Rick Deckard's motivation because of this. One point in its favour is that the title was changed for the film because it really isn't a film of the book."
fergpens,"Feb 7, 2002",10/10,"Blade Runner is my favourite film of all time. I first saw it 20 years ago and I still see something new everytime I see it.This is a thinking mans film. You cannot understand it in one nights rental or 1 viewing. Keep watching it, it seeps into your mind and stays there because Blade Runner asks so many questions of the viewer.It challenges you to think Who, Why, When?.. and that takes time. I could analyse it all night, but if I mentioned the music by Vangelis,the oriental music as the children ride through the streets on their bikes, the photo that Deckard looks at of Rachels family that suddenly comes alive and you hear the sound of laughter and better times, the moving speech by Roy as he declares Its Time to Die... , those lucky enough to see the film will now what I mean about its constant ability to generate a wide array of deep emotions."
Stud-12,"Aug 24, 1999",7/10,"I watched this movie for the first time on DVD today, and left the room with mixed emotion. On one hand, there was the visual affect that the movie had. Ridley Scott (of Alien fame, another favorite movie of mine)directed the movie with such brilliance that he belongs in a category usually reserved for Kubrick, or maybe Speilberg. The film also affected me intellectually, and left many unaswered questions, that I still cannot manage to find the answers to. ""Was Deckard REALLY a replicant?"" is the most haunting of all. While the movie is very deep, it is sometimes drawn out and long. I saw the directors' cut, so the narration was deleted. Perhaps that may have added more to my experiance. I give it a 7."
atlasmb,"Oct 9, 2017",10/10,"When ""Blade Runner"" was released, it was not very successful at the box office, but some viewers recognized it for what it was--a stylish sci-fi noir. Harrison Ford plays the retired blade runner Rick Deckard, whose job is to eliminate rogue/illegal androids. A handful have escaped to Earth, so Deckard is drafted to end the threat.This film served as the blueprint for many dystopian films to follow. Director Ridley Scott's future Los Angeles is dark, oily, rain-soaked, and smoky. A blend of the old and the new are fused in the gritty Sino-American culture that is ground-level LA, far below the forbidding, soaring towers that house the powerful.The wonderful cast includes Sean Young, Rutger Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Joanna Cassidy, Edward James Olmos, M. Emmet Walsh and William Sanderson. Their quirks and passions add a vibrancy that is lacking in their environment, though it is rich in detail.The pace of the film is leisurely, as if Scott wants the camera to linger over every facial expression, every moment, every ephemeral object. It takes us inside Deckard's vulnerabilities, down dark alleyways of decay, and even reveals the hidden reflections of a photograph.In the end, ""Blade Runner"" is a contemplation of mortality. Adapted from a novel by Philip K. Dick--a model for many other sci-fi films to follow--it immerses the viewer in an alternate world that feels both real and unreal, and cleverly asks more questions than it answers."
Chandru2206J,"Aug 13, 2024",6/10,"This movie is about an ex-policeman who was tasked with capturing escaped androids in a futuristic, somewhat dystopian world. Although the idea of setting the movie in a futuristic world was interesting for the time it was released, I found the movie to be mediocre compared to later sci-fi futuristic movies I had seen before.While I understand that it is a classic and a groundbreaking film in cinema history, watching it in 2024, I felt that the movie's storytelling was slow and often left me feeling distracted or even sleepy. The major drawback, in my opinion, was the slow pace of storytelling.The movie's themes, such as androids seeking free will, an android believing it is human, and the android's musings on life and death, have been explored in later films, which made the plot of this movie feel predictable and the character arcs less enjoyable.The futuristic world depicted in the movie was visually appealing, the actors did a great job, and the cinematography was impressive, but the overall color tone felt off to me. Additionally, the music in the movie was underwhelming and seemed almost nonexistent.In conclusion, watching this movie after seeing other sci-fi movies about androids that came after it dampened my enjoyment of it. I recognize that individual viewers may have different experiences, but for me, the movie failed to impress due to watching it at a later time."
MonkeyPundit,"Oct 8, 2010",1/10,"Blade Runner is perhaps the worst film adaption of a novel ever made. To say that Blade Runner is an adaption of Phillip K Dick's inspiring novel ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep"" is not only a lie, but it is an insult to both Phillip K. Dick and any movie that has been adapted to film with even a marginal degree of success. It is most generous and honest to say that Blade Runner is inspired by ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"".Blade Runner presents, at best, a surface-level representation of a select few of the novel's characters; these representations are devoid of the depth that made them captivating. Likewise, there are many great (and well-developed) characters who were excluded from the film.The subplots, entire segments of the plot, the greater part of its ethos, and major aspects of the novel's theme are also expunged from this film. In short, the elements of the novel that have moral, narrative, effusive, or dramatic merit are conspicuously absent from this film.Instead of being a narrative that re-affirms greater truths about humanity, Blade Runner exists only as a testament to sloppy adaptation by screenwriters who have such little respect for literature that they would cinematically re-hash a novel's spark notes.I believe that, were the novel by which Blade Runner is inspired more widely read, society would recognize Blade Runner as the fecal insult to great literature that it is."
nickfaldo,"Sep 16, 2022",10/10,"I just love this film, as it gives you everything you want, from a film noir. The visuals in this film, are simply outstanding, and the pace of the film is lovely.This is the most comprehensive vision of the future, I have ever seen. I like the sequel also, but feel the sequel is a little yto slow.The musical score, is one of the most rememberable, in film history. This film is a treat, and is one of my favourate performances, by Harrison Ford.The use of lighting, rain fog and smoke in this film is amazing. It is one of the most visually interesting films, ever made.This is a film, that is important in film history."
ericstevenson,"Feb 14, 2017",10/10,"Wow, that was one of the most insane movies I have ever seen in my entire life. Luckily, I'm the guy who absolutely loves stuff like that. What I found weird about this was how there were all these unrelated stories being shown one after another. It was indeed great to see them all connect at the end. It was just hard to keep up with how they kept changing from one to the next. Anyway, this was still an absolutely wonderful film. It's mostly because it's such a beautiful looking movie. I simply can't believe this was made in 1982. I mean with these great visuals, it looks more like it was made in the 2000s!They mention 2017 as a date at one point and it's weird to be reviewing this in that year. My dad was right. This really was a movie that just puts you in a whole new world. It's hard to comprehend what's going on because everything is just so ridiculous. It's pretty easy to say it was dreamlike. I mean, this literally seems like a dream I would have. I guess dreams are something we can all relate to. It was about as easy to follow as one! I thought that it would be like an overblown action movie at first. Instead, there wasn't that much action and it instead just let its beautiful sets tell the story.I really do feel myself sympathizing and caring for the characters even though it was really hard for me to follow. I am so glad that there was an opening scene that told us all that was going on. I'll never get over how wonderful this movie looks for being made in the early 1980's. I guess this was just a thing for Harrison Ford back then as it was the same time the original ""Star Wars"" movies were made. While this wasn't as good as those, it was just a visual masterpiece you couldn't help but get lost in its world. The pacing is just amazing, with so much being set up at the right time. Please watch this! ****"

With a haunting musical score by Vangelis that adds a hypnotic quality to those breathtaking landscapes of a mega-city in a dystopian future. To me, Ridley Scott's visionary masterpiece represents the ultimate Science Fiction film (and the final cut is the version to watch)."

jacobhunt6,"Aug 18, 2020",7/10,"I get the feeling that a lot of people watch Blade Runner expecting it to be a sci-fi action thriller in the vein of Star Wars, or at least be more action-oriented than it is. But, even though it's visceral and different, Blade Runner is a classic once you get past the disappointment at the lack of laser fights.Taking after Philip K. Dick's novel, Blade Runner is more of a commentary on the role of technology in society. And the depths and lengths to which it goes to explore the issue are incredible. It's a film with layered characters, dialogue laden with undertone and a whole lot of metaphor and motif.Harrison Ford has found his own in another role seemingly written for him. He plays the disenchanted protagonist excellently (a la Star Wars and Indiana Jones), and this time is met with a wonderful opposite in Rutger Hauer's Roy, an antagonist whose morality and motives are put into question right until the end of the film. It's one of those stories that offers more questions than it does answers, leaving you pondering what it all meant and what happens next.I always enjoy a film that leaves its thematic question open to interpretation. Blade Runner never settles on who the ""good guy"" or the ""bad guy"" is, but instead poses you a question and leaves you to consider it for yourself.7 out of 10, definitely don't expect a space opera, and expect it to make you think."

johnnyboyz,"Apr 13, 2010",7/10,"Blade Runner will eventually see its two lead characters, or its protagonist and his ultimate goal in tracking something down in the form of another character, share a memorable scene on a roof top of a distant Los Angeles, far into the future. After all of what's gone on and after all the venturing and the talking and the process of investigation, it boils down to one 'evil' character, who's a machine, and one 'just' character, a human-being, interacting; at which point we realise the human-being was a genre archetype and a plain old character following orders given to him by a larger force whereas the robot was a wandering, free spirit whom dared to dream and craved more out of life. The human comes across as more machine-like than the machine, with the machine coming across as more emotional and feeling-filled than the member of the human species. Such is the richness of Blade Runner that tn a lesser film, this exchange wouldn't have taken place and the character of Roy might've been a homicidal robot with a mindless agenda.Born into a slavery; used and then put through a grinder of negative emotions, Roy revolts and breaks out, consequently freeing himself and allowing himself the ability to explore things at his own pace, opening up his mind and allowing him to explore; learn; love and want to harm those that destroyed what he loved after being an assistant to the system. Blade Runner is like that, an eye on spectacle and scope for its location just as much as it has a spot of affection for its characters in what they think, feel and desire; if indeed they're even interested in anything more than grey trench-coats; glum expressions and order following .The lead is a certain ex-police officer named Rick Deckard (Ford), a man occupying a glum and gloomy, rain-sodden Los Angeles in 2019; a man of whom trudges through damp, wet streets with many others in a doomy looking; steamy and enclosed Chinatown area as large blimps hover above the mere mortals scrambling around in their squaller advertising breaks away to more tropical, more Utopian places. Director Ridley Scott opens his film with an establishing shot of the entire city, flying cars and the impressive canopy layer of some skyscrapers capturing the beauty and sheer awe within as an accompanying instrumental musical track emphasises both these traits. This is interestingly interjecting with random bursts of flames from vents of some kind, the likes that instill sudden senses of danger and risk of harm; perfectly capturing the world he's about to take us into as the camera very slowly creeps towards the city.The film gives its lead, Deckard, a mission in the grand tradition of noir in the sense it is his job to find something for someone. In days of old; be it The Maltese Falcon or Murder, My Sweet; noir leads have usually looked for an item or a person. Blade Runner, in all its hybridising glory, has fun with this particular premise in having its lead look for a sort of combination of both: a man/machine hybrid named a Replicant. The chief Replicants in the story, who've gone rouge and are seeking an extension of life, are Pris (Hannah), the film's femme fatale archetype whose birthday the film teasingly places on Valentine's Day; Zhora (Cassidy); Leon Kowalski (James) and the somewhat deranged and equally disturbing in his persistent state of calmness, Roy Batty (Hauer).Scott gets across a sense of futuristic scope in the film by setting a sequence at the slimiest, seediest and nastiest of run down night spots than you can, but a place that actually comes with advanced video phone technology in the back, suggesting that a sense of technological advancement has reached even these sorts of God-forsaken places. The film's meshing of classical noir with more contemporary science fiction is a given; but the film's hybridising of genres is perhaps best highlighted in a scene involving two characters, a toy manufacturer named Seb (Sanderson) and the aforementioned Pris, whom walk down a hallway of an apartment block towards Seb's home. Lights from outside systematically light up and make dimmer again the hallway, in doing so, casting expressionistic shadows across the walls and floors rendering the location one of both horror and noir as this strange looking woman with an agenda attempts to infiltrate her way in. The sequence is given an added sense of horror when we enter the man's apartment and observe the uncanny array of odd looking moving toys he has made over the years. This strange imagery combines with Pris' overall look in creating something quite terrifying, something the film acknowledges when it has Pris disguise herself as one of these toys later on in another sequence, suggesting a certain 'at one-ness' she shares with the items. The lighting lights the location the whole time with sudden glares and then total darkness, suggesting a sense of light or life that'll shortly come to an end, like an average house light strobing before it dies out.The film places Deckard on a strand of the detective ilk, he visits places and garners clues to everything which along the way leads him to the character of Rachel (Young), but the film is not an exercise in narrative as much as it is an exercise in technicality and mise-en-scene. Its grim view on man and machine being unable to co-exist in a world full of modernity and technological advancements is highlighted in an early scene involving Leon and a test of some description, as well as later on when Roy essentially kills off his creator, is counter-balanced with Deckard's ability to connect with Replicant Rachel. Blade Runner is an interesting film; a wonderful combining of a maker with a keen eye on the visual and love for one or more genres with complex items and ideas explored accordingly."
mattheddy,"Sep 15, 2019",3/10,"This movie is extremely slow! I could appreciate that if there was some great story telling going on. However it's not really clear what the hell is going on.Harrison Ford is just walking around looking confused. Shoots a lady that I think was a robot, then he practically raped another robot after she saved his life. You see the antagonist only twice in the first hour of the film. He goes to his creator asking for more life since the replicates only live for 4 years, then he kills him. Seems counter productive to me. Ford's character has another run in with the other lady bot and that was honestly laughable. What the hell was that? Then the showdown with the main antagonist, again laughable. I really was expecting so much more from this film. But I find it really hard to watch.I feel like everyone giving this movie high ratings is clinging to older styles of film making and trying to make this some philosophical masterpiece but I just don't see it. Then there are those saying this is so good because it doesn't use special effects and recent sci fi movies are full of bad cgi. There are plenty of sci-fi film's that have way better story lines and make you ponder life regardless of good or bad cgi. And how does a film not using cgi or special effects automatically make it a good film? This whole story is just blah. I'm really so confused why this has such a high rating. It's in my opinion very tough to watch. I feel like they could have done so much more with this film. Don't get me wrong it is visually appealing especially for being made in the early 80's but that's about the extent of the pros with this movie.I'm watching this movie because I wanted some background before I watch Blade Runner 2049, I just hope the story telling and pacing are better than this one."

I have a copy of this movie in all kinds of media. Just love everything in this movie, the plot, the cinematography, music score, visual effects, actors, direction. The last 20 minutes of the movie are just memorable, it summarizes the reasons why we want to live in general. The greatest Rutger Hauer as android Roy gave us a powerful, very strong performance that reminds me of Otello.Just an AMAZING, STUNNING, BEAUTIFUL movie to see any time of the year!!!"

roy-baty,"May 31, 2024",10/10,"I first watched this amazing work of art when I was 12 years old. It had a huge impact on me then and still does today. From the musical score, special effects, story, cinematography, acting and atmosphere this film has it all. This film was 20 years ahead of its time and a pure joy to watch. Ridley Scott's vision and skill in filmmaking is outstanding. Character development is phenomenal, but most of all the special effects shine brighter than any film made in its time. The performance of Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty was the best of his career. Why this film never got the recognition at the time of release is beyond me. Frankly, I think it was simply over too many people's heads.I've seen it at least 100 times and enjoy it more each time. Blade Runner is a true masterpiece that has never been, and will never be replicated."
dayton-w-price,"May 21, 2020",10/10,"I love absolutely everything about this film, to visuals, costumes, backgrounds characters, dialogue between characters, the perfect score by Vangelis, just to name a few examples. Harrison Ford gives one of my favorite performances of his decorated career, and that's saying something. I also love and adore Sean Young as Rachael, she fits the role so perfectly and, you really start to care about her as the movie progresses along, I think it's one her best performances too. Ridley Scott was a master of his craft at the top of his game when he directed this masterpiece, right after directing his other masterpiece that is Alien. I felt inspired to write this review after seeing and be very disappointed with the sequel Blade Runner 2049. If you never seen this film, stop whatever it is your doing and go watch it. I'd give it a rating higher then 10 if I could."
PIST-OFF,"May 21, 1999",7/10,"I thought Blade Runner was a good movie but up until seeing it I had heard unearthly amounts of good things about the movie.

I do however like some things. The set design, costumes, and a super sexy Sean Young are all definite pluses. Maybe I'm not seeing something"
stav,"Dec 8, 2001",10/10,"This film is definitely the greatest Science-fiction/Drama movie ever made. Ridley Scott has managed to create a movie (in conjunction with the story) that depicts the future of the world and technology in an outstanding manner whereby an environment of solitude and closure is created amongst an influx of over-population and overwhelming advertising and entrepreneurial/urban development.The feeling of darkness and bleak desolation is beautifully conveyed as a result of the wonderful directing, and the musical undertones create the ultimate balance between surrealism and fiction.Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer both give great performances, but the movie in itself works so well that no matter who played those roles, this movie would have been a success anyway.In my opinion, this is really what movies are all about. It gives a fantastic account of what the director is trying to show us through the storyline while leaving the viewer mesmerized and captivated by what he/she has seen, and at the same time questioning the future and its implications.This is an exceptionally original movie and one that will remain a classic for millions of other movies to come. Brilliant stuff.Rating  -5 out of 5-"
sjwest,"Dec 2, 2000",7/10,"What strikes me most about this movie is the creation of a futuristic earth.Scott's vision of the LA of the future makes this movie not seem to be outdated even at almost twenty years after it was released.Ford and Hauer's strong on-screen presense does not overawe the screenplay and the supporting cast did not come across as the usual obligatory characters who were just there to keep the play going.They definently added their own magic. Although it may be slow-moving to some,this is what makes most good movies brilliant.Tension build-up and identification with the main characters is thus fostered. Blade Runner is for me a true cult classic and well worth the rental money."
frederikbarndorff,"Oct 4, 2017",10/10,"Blade Runner is a 1982 sci-fi, noir film directed by Ridley Scott, starring Harrison Ford, Sean Young and Rutger Hauer. The film was written by Hampton Fancher and David Peopless. The film is based on Phillid K. Dicks novel: Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? There exists multiple cuts of the film, the most prominent being the theatrical cut, the director's cut and the final cut, which is the version i will be reviewing. We follow Blade Runner, Rick Deckard who is assigned to to ""retire"" 4 Replicants on Earth. The film is set in future Los Angeles where the replicants try to find there maker: Dr. Eldon Tyrell. Deckard now has to find the replicants in the polluted City before they can get to Dr. Tyrell. When i first saw Blade Runner i was quite disappointed, i thought the pacing was awful and the chemistry between Young and Ford was non-existing. However, after my second and third viewing something changed. It was also surprising to me that i was drawn back to the film again after the first viewing. I simply couldn't get Blade Runner out of my head and after the third viewing it became one of, if not my favorite film of all time. I began to take notice of all the small details that Ridley Scott put in the film. I discover something new every time i see the film. What also made me love Blade Runner is all the ways it can be interpreted. The themes of what it means to be human and life are strong themes, treated with such complexity through the visuals. What has been said a million times is that this is a beautiful film. I would say it's probably the most beautiful film i've ever seen. The film contains the best miniature work since Star Wars. The performances are a little mixed. Rutger Hauer gives in my opinion the best performance in the film. Ford gives a decent performance, Ford didn't really enjoy the shoot and Worning with Scott and he does come off as uninterested in some scenes, but i think it works for the film. It is a film noir and for that reason Fords' cold performance works. He really reminds you of the classic Humprey Bogart detective. It's Sean Youngs first film role, but she gives a decent performance. I've already talked about the visuals, but another standout feature of the film is it's music. The score by Vangelis is very unique and fits the film perfectly. The atmosphere of the film is enhanced to perfection by the score. For the above mentioned reasons i consider Blade Runner to be one of the best films of all time. You can enjoy the film for the visuals alone, but If you pay close attention you will discover a very deep and thought provoking sci-fi film. Final rating: 10/10⭐️"
toseale,"Jul 31, 2022",4/10,"I just don't get Blade Runner. It's a cool concept, but one that I just can't stand behind because of its delivery. Why do robots need to bleed? Why in the world is Harrison Ford the only one going after a bunch of crazy deadly robots? Why not a team? Why do we need romance between a character and a robot? I can completely understand the idea of robots evolving to have emotion and human behaviors, but there's just so much I can't get behind with this movie, and that's where it fails in the end. I don't quite understand the hype. And maybe I just didn't pay attention enough, but I didn't enjoy it as much as I thought it was. The slow pacing didn't make it any better. Not one I really plan on rewatching any time soon."

marcusq22,"Jul 30, 2015",9/10,"I see Blade Runner as a hybrid of three different genres: sci-fi, art-house, and film noir.One thing I've long appreciated about sci-fi is that, at it's best, it provides a platform for a treatment of philosophical topics. The ""what makes us human?"" topic is a meaty one, and they give it the treatment it deserves in Blade Runner. The opening scenes with the Voight-Kampff tests are an excellent lead-in to this discussion as they challenge the viewer to ask themselves ""How would I react in these situations?"" That engagement with the viewer does a lot to draw them into the story. The vivid setting elements pull the viewer in even deeper.Art-house films are more of an acquired taste; they require some patience from the viewer. 2001 kind of set the example for art-house/sci-fi, and I think Blade Runner was following in it's wake. A lot of people badmouth Alien 3 for similar reasons. The big issue there, I think, was that audiences were expecting a sci-fi/action movie (like they got with Aliens (2)) and were served up a slower-paced, more arty, piece instead. Mismanaged expectations. Zardoz is another art-house/sci-fi film along these lines.Classic Noir films (e.g. 40s-50s era) are typified by bleak tones: people are trapped in unpleasant situations, the world around them is corrupt, and the characters typically drive toward a doomed fate. (The ""Private Eye giving a voice-over"" is also a hallmark of the noir genre.) I've typically described noir as ""part crime drama, part psychological thriller, part bittersweet romance."" Neo-noir builds on the genre and typically adds the following elements: identity crises, memory issues / subjectivity, and -- most importantly -- technological problems and their social ramifications. All of these things describe Blade Runner to a 'T'.﻿"
amelieproductions-67179,"Aug 25, 2024",9/10,"This is a classic that still holds today. A unique look into AI and what it truly means to be human. Harrison Ford fits the clean shaven, film-noir archetype. It is stylish and unique with fascinating visuals that make you forget you are watching something from the 80s. Yes the 80s does slip out here and there, but it was still massively ahead of its time. It has a soundtrack laced with synthesizers with almost melancholic undertones. It's an interesting perspective on the concept of artificial humans and how morality plays into it. I noticed the use of the term ""retiring"" rather than dead. We couldn't say they are dead, that would make them feel too human. We have to make sure not to blur the lines too much, no matter how human they seem. After all they cannot be fully conscious, or can they? Could we take it that far? And what really makes something alive? Sean Young looks beautiful and keeps a haunting gaze to the camera. So soulful but soulless at the same time. She nailed it."
TxMike,"Mar 18, 2000",N/A,"Harrison Ford and the other actors do a fine job in this darkly-filmed sci-fi movie but the storyline is quite simple and the search for""replicants"" fairly predictable.  Compared to other 1980s movies like Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, etc, this one just does not hold up to those standards. And modern sci-fi movies like ""The Matrix"" simply blow it away.When I read all the comments so far by ""Blade Runner"" fans, it sounds to me like they are talking about a ""7"" or ""8"" movie, but they give it a ""10"".  I think ""7"" or ""8"" is about correct.The DVD version has great sound and a sharp picture. It is an enjoyable movie, worth seeing, but just don't have your expectations too high."
rleather,"Sep 19, 2001",7/10,"Not that I try to draw comparison with the two films, mind.OK. Fact is, when you watch the film later in life its really not as good as you remember. Sure it looks spectacular, even by todays standards and production value shows in every shot. But the actual plot, portrayal of emotions and script do leave certain aspects to be desired.Lets take for example, how does a man who is so obviously sensitive to the world get a job essentially killing ('artificial') people. It seems to so contrast with his character. In an early scene he voices (albiet in the over dubbed version) criticism of a police man being racist (the 'skin jobs' comment). Yet we are talking about a man who executes them. Surely I'm the only person to find this rather odd.But am I nitpicking? Its more of a visual film than truly philosophical and the added 'noir talk over' does nothing but simplify the action for the easy viewing audience.At least the 'directors' cut went someway to rectify the faults. No happy ending shot (to open car on a strangely clean and pollution free country road....). Plus the re-introduction of the idea that Rick Dekkard is a replicant himself, via the vehicle of the unicorn as dream content, metaphor, and finally, modeled in silver paper.Having said that, the book wasn't terrific either. So what can you say?Over rated? Yes.But still not a bad film in any sense of the word.The problem is that Science Fiction as a genre has been so badly served by its movie incarnations that people clutch at the better ones and escalate their worth. In my mind, that one truly superb Science fiction film has yet to be made.Somebody add some thought provoking script to the visuals of Blade Runner and run the film at the speed of ""The Matrix"" and then we'll be talking.One last rant. In the voice over version he say ""Sushi, that's why my wife calls me. Cold fish"".Only problem is that Sushi means 'seasoned rice dish' or just 'rise dish'. It's Sashimi that's actually cold fish. You'd have thought he knew this.... woundn't you."

As a vision of the future it is almost perfect, and even when watching it in 2017, there is nothing that implies it was made in 1982; this movie has not aged at all. In fact is is so good as a 'stand alone', that I'm hoping the sequel doesn't ruin it. The future is exactly how one would imagine it to be, the story is set within the realms of extreme possibility, and the acting is believable. Recommended."
na-59171,"Dec 8, 2024",10/10,"I just watched Blade Runner with my friends, and I'm still reeling from the experience. This movie is, hands down, one of the most epic and thought-provoking films I've ever seen. I'm giving it a solid 10 out of 10 stars - it's that good!First off, the visuals are absolutely stunning. The special effects are so ahead of its time, it's mind-boggling. The cityscapes, the flying cars, the robots - everything looks so real and immersive. I felt like I was right there in the future with Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford).The storyline is incredibly deep and complex. It's not just some action-packed sci-fi flick; it's actually making you think about what it means to be human. The replicants, these artificial beings that are almost indistinguishable from humans, are seeking longer lifespans and more rights. It's like, what does it mean to be alive, you know?Harrison Ford is absolutely phenomenal as Deckard. He's got this whole tough-guy thing going on, but you can tell he's also got feelings and doubts. And Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty? Forget about it - the guy's a genius. His monologue at the end is, like, whoa.The pacing is perfect, the score is hauntingly beautiful, and the themes are timeless. This movie is a masterpiece, plain and simple. If you haven't seen it yet, do yourself a favor and watch it ASAP. Trust me, you won't regret it.10/10 stars, would watch again and again and again."
Rammstein-2,"Jan 11, 2000",7/10,"I voted only for the director's cut version. The original release is not half as good with the completely unnecessary narrative and the insipid happy-go-lucky ending. Set well into the 3rd millennium, a bunch of robots, Replicants return to Earth, where they're not allowed under penalty of death. Ford plays a tired, worn Blade Runner, a person who hunts the replicants down and kills them. Brilliant, dark with a calm that almost makes it a sci-fi drama rather than action. The question that drives the film is: is Deckard (Ford) a Replicant himself? The upcoming sequel with tell..."
steel_arkangel,"Nov 7, 2010",2/10,"Being in my 40's and a big Sci-Fi fan, it was really odd that I had never seen this movie till now - and I have to say, it wasn't worth the wait!I wont argue that the film was very artfully shot, but the story was slow and just bizarre.Of course bizarre is what film students and art critics love, so I'm not surprised that this is so highly thought of, and i'm sure they spend many an evening pouring over the plot, trying to find hidden meanings that aren't really there.Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar..... Sometimes a slow and dated plot, is just a slow and dated plot.....If you watch movies, not to make yourself look intelligent, but rather (heaven forbid), to be entertained, give this one a miss."

lincolnsmith-75033,"Jul 12, 2018",N/A,"Blade Runner is considered one of the greatest science fiction films ever made and it is easy to see why. Deeply thematic, rich characters, a fantastic script and nuanced performances toppled with some of the greatest cinematography ever put on film this is a film version of the mona lisa- every frame can be hung on a wall. Ridley Scott, fresh off the success of Alien is in top form and Blade Runner will be the film he will always be remembered for. Harrison Ford is competent as Deckard and anyone expecting him to be the usual dashing hero will be disappointed. Rutger Hauer steals the show as head replicant Roy Batty. The noir look of the film has inspired so many movies and video games since there isn't really a point talking about it- you have to see it to believe it. One of the greatest films ever made. Period."
CJIscan,"Aug 25, 1999",7/10,"Having seen this movie on a small TV, it seems it does the film more justice to say that even in the situation, I was thoroughly blown away. The flying billboards which, you know, if they could, they'd plaster them across the skyline, the constant presecense of rain, all of these set a mood and create an atmosphere so thick you could cut it with a knife. Beyond the special effects...there's not as much as you'd like. Harrison Ford is good as a character you can't feel much for, but he nonetheless does a good job. There's not point in wasting words on giving the plot, there's far too little space to effectively give it away. Points of interest in the movie are the finale (which is like a vivid nightmare), where Rutger Hower truly shines. All and all, an off and on movie which nonetheless keeps you enthralled."

meoowens,"Jun 7, 2023",6/10,"This film's greatest strength is how it attempted (and pioneered?) a grungy, dark, semi-realistic sci-if version of earth. Despite the various details and caveats of the futuristic setting, the film succeeds at world building without convoluting the plot or confusing the audience. In general this movie looks great and does an impressive job of creating an immersive science fiction landscape given the technology available in the 80s. As far as plot and character development goes, there isn't too much to celebrate. The characters are multifaceted and interesting, but they don't garner much care or connection from the audience. Overall this movie succeeds in its imaginative components, but doesn't offer a moving story."

nsanehops,"Mar 2, 2006",7/10,"(ATTENTION: SPOILERS) Blade Runner is a good film; I gave it 7/10. If I was around in 1982, I probably would have been blown away and thought it was the best thing I'd ever seen. But since I'm pretty young, I've been jaded by many other sci-fi masterpieces. I saw Blade Runner for the first time only a few years ago.Here are the positives: Brilliant cinematography, thought-provoking subject matter, great special effects (for 1982), a haunting score (the scene where Deckard shoots the chick replicant in the clear raincoat is seared in my memory), rich set design, and adequate acting.Here are some negatives: Very slow pace (yes, I have been too affected today's films), completely unbelievable scientific advancements (especially for 2019), and bad sound effects. I had a hard time buying into the whole interrogation of replicants. If they're man-made ""organisms,"" there has to be an easier way to distinguish them (maybe a DNA test or something). I also had a hard time believing that Deckard and Rachel were in love. That part of the story was lacking.Other films since Blade Runner (like Bicentennial Man and A.I.) have dealt with the same philosophical questions about the meaning of life and at what point does a ""robot"" become a person. I'm not saying that the two films I mentioned were better (cuz I'd get torn a new one) but I saw them before I saw Blade Runner and thus had already been exposed to the ""cyberpunk"" world and its philosophical questions.Anyway, that's my abridged opinion."
reykwon36,"Dec 18, 2017",2/10,"Boring, boring...and oh yes, boring. Nothing new or clever about the story even for the time in which it was released. Missed this one a a kid but I watched it 3 times as an adult really trying to enjoy it but it just never happened. Not an action junky here, nor do I need big, loud hollywood dazzle in my movies. I simply cannot understand why this movie is given such praise, it's just not a good movie. Outside of being visually ahead of it's time, it's a huge FAIL."
RosRuy,"Mar 2, 2021",10/10,"The completely out-of-the-box story, the cast and its nighttime magic that included unique dialogues and also the soundtrack, makes this is movie the best ever made !"
wittkecmission,"Mar 7, 2020",9/10,"Blade Runner is one of the most famous and influential science fiction films of all time and one of the most mysterious too. It's a rare film that shows earth in the future as a bleak and dreary wasteland, which is most likely what it will turn out to be. It's also one of those films that reward multiple viewings. It also has, in my opinion, the best synthetic humans in a film. The monologue that Rutger Hauer's character gives towards the end of the film is one of the most moving ever, and it's truthful. How all the moments of your life in the end will be forgotten and lost in time, ""like tears in rain""."
DickieGoodman,"Jun 13, 2018",10/10,Bladerunner is my favorite movie because its so immersive and the noir ambiance takes you into another world no matter how surreal. I never thought Decker was a replicant never even thought of it until all the hype from the new film which does a great job too :)
ametaphysicalshark,"Jan 6, 2008",N/A,"* This comment was written following a theatrical screening of Ridley Scott's final cut of ""Blade Runner"" and is written about this newest version.Before I get started I must note that ""The Final Cut"" is a definitive cut of the film. This is the most cohesive, well-paced, and entertaining cut of the film, by FAR. I really hope Ridley Scott doesn't go do another cut because this one is as much as can be done without altering the script or filming new scenes.Another point I was thinking about during the film is how much of a 'theater movie' this is. I have seen the film in two forms (director's/theatrical) a total of three times, and though I always thought it was a good film, I never quite saw what all the fuss was about. A good, solid science fiction film was what I saw each time, but I had what felt like an epiphany during this viewing. The film is easily one of THE MOST GORGEOUS things I've ever seen. Brilliantly shot by Jordan Cronenweth (and I definitely give Ridley Scott some credit for how good this looks), the film is astoundingly beautiful and effective on the big screen. When watching it one realizes that each shot was painstakingly thought out, but unlike some others I've seen, the film is so fluid that you can't stop to think about such matters.One of several flaws I still believe ""Blade Runner"" suffers from is Vangelis' then ultra-modern score, which by today's standards is so dated it's distracting. That's not to say the film isn't well-scored, but synthesizer scores always bug me because they're bound to sound dated, and this is coming from a guy who loves 80's electronic music (the good stuff, not MTV). Another distracting aspect of the score was the bizarre combination of East Asian, Indian, and Arabic music which felt completely out of place and often forced. Since I'm criticizing the movie in this paragraph I'll throw in my opinion that the script was unbalanced in points, though drastically improved over the original 'voiceover included' version. I felt that dialogue could get distractingly forced at times.Still, during this viewing of ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut["" I noticed that the majority of criticism leveled at the film is a big load of rubbish. Technically speaking, there is basically nothing at all wrong with the film. Visual effects are excellent, photography and editing are accomplished, and the acting is phenomenal across the board, be it Ford, Hauer, Hannah, or Young, watching them was a pleasure.There is something the film communicates when seen on the big screen which is missing from home video viewings, and I'm not sure what it is. Is the film so visually dazzling that viewing it on a theater screen glosses over its numerous errors and some other minor flaws, or is it just that with Ridley Scott finally fully overseeing the final product the film has really improved as much as it did in my eyes? Whatever it was, ""Blade Runner: The Final Cut"" is an outstanding science fiction film, not without its flaws, but still one of the most effective films in the genre I've ever seen, and though it forsakes a lot of Phillip K. Dick's philosophical pondering to focus more on the pulp-ish if quite intelligent sci-fi/neo-noir aspect of ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", the film stands so well on its own that I left the theater overwhelmed and feeling even a bit privileged to have had the chance to view this incredible film on the big screen and learn to appreciate it more.9/10"
cagebox111,"Jun 3, 2021",6/10,"Blade Runner is a revolutionary Science Fiction film with visuals that still hold up decades after its release. A thought-provoking film, Blade Runner is larger on ideas than action as the movie is a very slow and bleak ride. Blade Runner is not a film I enjoyed watching much but was one I was still thinking about after viewing and appreciate more for its reputation than my actual viewing experience. Reading other's glowing reviews makes me want to give this a higher rating, but from an entertainment standpoint I found this to be an average movie."
rdhceo,"Oct 26, 2019",10/10,"After watching the sequel to this film - went back to watch the original again just to wash the bad taste off of my palate. Denis Villeneuve directed the sequel as well as ""The Arrival"" - which is somehow even worse than the Blade Runner sequel - it was insulting to watch. Willing to bet that many of the people who left the poor reviews for the original Blade Runner - went on to watch the sequel and say it was great. Casting Gosling to lead that film pretty much destroyed it right out of the box. The only thing that could of been worse would of been to put DiCaprio in the lead - which makes me even more nauseous. If they make another sequel - I wouldn't watch it if it was the last new movie to ever be made.Anyone who requires needs an explanation as to why this film is superior.- is beyond help. This film is not Star Wars, Avengers or Alien. It is NOT a story regarding flying about in space ships and chasing aliens and interacting with comical robots. This story is about relationships and was very well crafted.The technical aspects of this film, the music, photography, story line, acting, etc. make it a science fiction classic that will never be reproduced."
dark-10,"Dec 5, 2001",1/10,"This by no means was a great movie. Movies like this and Taxi Driver, I just don't understand how people can rate it in the top 100 of ALL TIME.Yes, the visual effects were great even by today's standards. But visuals alone don't make a movie. Otherwise the new Planet of the Apes should be mentioned in the top 100 too. Furthermore, I thought Ford was a total miscast (though not as much as Hoffman woulda been).I kinda got the feeling this movie couldn't decide if it wanted to be a philosophical drama, but then an action movie at times. It ultimately failed on both fronts.If you wanna see a philisophical, non-action Sci-Fi, IMO Gattaca did much better.Like others have mentioned here, this woulda been much better as a short. Not a 2 hour picture. And as for all the different ""versions"", I don't even care anymore.Check this one out if you will, just don't anticipate anything spectacular about it."
shawnk,"Dec 7, 2005",8/10,"After seeing this movie over 10 times (over the years) I have to say that the 'directors cut' does not hold up to the stand of time when compared to the actual 'first release' version.The release version had the classic 'detective voice over' which really added A LOT to the plot and the depth of the characters.I moved my rating down from '9' to '8' for this reason. As time goes on and movies evolve we tend to demand better quality.Unlike Casablanca, Blade Runner has become shallower over the years. Still a good movie, its just no longer 'that good' of a movie.In general I find that directors who leave open key themes in the plot deliver a more shallow product. Weaving the threads of each theme in a plot together to form a composite whole is what a voice over does.Ultimately the play between good and evil for a cop/detective/centurion is a timeless story about individual response to evils of socially engineered injustice (intended or unintentional).I would like to see a re-release of the movie with the original voice over. It would make a difference."
ezvara,"Jul 10, 2020",10/10,"My non-native English is far not enough to express how I feel about this film. Out in the USA in 1982. In my country in1988-89 or so.( I make a remark right now, that the Life of Brian and the Holy Grail plus some others were also as much as life defining for me , but in a different way. Truly and honestly ).This film , right now, is still could represent a NEAR distant dystopian future .
Even if it is an AI with the full potential scale of HUMAN emotions."
Esteraur999,"Jun 12, 2015",9/10,"I LOVE Blade Runner! I read the book before seeing the film, and enjoyed it to a sufficient degree, and was excited to see the film but nothing could have prepared me for the beauty and majesty of this film. I will say that I originally saw the Director's Cut, then saw the international, and have seen the beginning of the Final Cut. I can acknowledge the many flaws in this film, but I can look past them to see a film that is a poetic and beautiful film. But I'm very afraid (like being a slave) because I tried to watch Blade Runner with my best friend and my cousin. My best friend couldn't make it past the introduction of Pris. My cousin spent half the film looking at her iPad. When I asked her why she wasn't paying attention, she responded that she was listening. You can't just listen to Blade Runner! The film is a visual masterpiece and if you can't just listen to it! This work of art is being lost on our current generation who can't sit through what makes it so amazing! I give Blade Runner a 9.8/10"

Chrysanthepop,"Apr 25, 2008",N/A,"'Blade Runner' is one of those movies that offer so much that it requires and deserves repeated viewing. It is filled with allegory, allusion, other metaphors and so much philosophy. The writing is exceptional as the screenplay is layered and the dialogues are very philosophical. It's a fantastic film to discuss with others as it ends on an ambiguous note and there is a lot of symbolism that is open to interpretation. Perhaps I too will be editing my comment after viewing it again.On the technical side, it looks amazing. The dark dazzling world is eerily real. It also reminds one of noir classics. It does not have the stop motion that CGI's of today's movies have. I loved the technology that was used in 80's movies like 'Blade Runner', 'Starwars', 'The Dark Crystal' and 'Labyrinth'. They made their worlds more real to me. And when I revisit those movies today, it brings a nostalgic feeling as I remember how much I enjoyed these films. In the more recent movies, it's quite easy to tell which scenes were done with CGI as there is a lack of authentic look about it. Back to 'Blade Runner', the special effects and cinematography are mindblowing and how can anyone overlook Vangelis's powerful score? And what makes us appreciate them more is that none of them are over-the-top to the extent that they compromise the story.I haven't seen all of Ridley Scott's film but so far I'd say 'Blade Runner' is his best. His direction is solid. This wasn't an easy film to make and Scott deserves all the credit he's gotten. The cast is also interesting as it includes (then) not-so-famous actors. Harrison Ford, Rutger Hauer, Sean Young, Edward James Olmos and Daryl Hannah all fit the bill.Today if one looks at these new science fiction wannabe movies, there's a sadness about how science fiction has progressed in Hollywood. Even now when very enjoyable brilliant films like 'Matrix' and 'X-men' are made, there are always sequels that completely destroy the essence of the first movie. But we will always have classics like 'Blade Runner' and 'Starwars' trilogy to revisit. 'Blade Runner' is a profound movie. It works on so many levels that it provides much more than pulp fiction entertainment."
Calicodreamin,"Feb 12, 2020",7/10,"I thought this was a pretty good 80s movie. It didn't blow me out of the water, and I don't necessarily feel the need to watch again, but it was enjoyable for a first time viewing. The acting was good and storyline flowed well and was fairly easy to follow. The characters had depth, and only said a few cheesy one liners. Overall a good movie."
jimbo-53-186511,"Feb 17, 2018",7/10,"Los Angeles 2019; a group of replicants have escaped from their own planet and are illegally residing on planet Earth. Their reasons for escape soon become clear as they are searching for the man that created them in order to extend their lifespan. It's up to former Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) to find the replicants and eliminate them as soon as possible...Blade Runner is a film that had been in my watchlist for a number of years, but I finally managed to sit down and watch it today. Although it's dubbed as a 'classic' and a 'science fiction masterpiece' I tried to blank these thoughts out and try to take it for what it is and on that basis I found it quite enjoyable...Granted the film is a little slow-paced and Harrison Ford's narration seems a little bit cheesy, but the fundamental aspects of the story are quite intriguing - fair enough there have been some copycat films that have followed Blade Runner (the recent Alex Garland film Ex Machina clearly owes some debt of gratitude to Blade Runner). I think the interesting thing about this film is that the replicants are painted in quite a negative light, but to be honest I did find myself having some empathy with their cause - they seemed to just want answers and weren't happy that they were only programmed to live for a total of 4 years. Yes the way they go about their business is questionable, but their cause is somewhat understandable.A couple of failings with this film lie not with the story, but more with how it is developed; the replicants are represented as being self-aware, but emotionless yet other than this we are given little insight into them as characters. A lot of what I've said in the last paragraph are based on my own suppositions and whilst I don't mind figuring out some things for myself in a film I do feel as though I should be given something to work with in the first place. The same can be said for Deckard and his relationship with Rachael - she's an experimental replicant who is capable of emotion through brain implants (presumably in an attempt to fool the Blade Runners), but again this relationship is glossed over and isn't really given the attention that it perhaps deserves - which in some ways taints the warm and fuzzy way that the film ends.Where the film does excel is in its visuals - it's a striking and beautiful looking film (it's actually scary watching this film now realising that it's only 1 year before it was set). Rutger Hauer is chilling as the leader of the replicants and his final showdown at the end with Harrison Ford was fantastic. A notable mention also should go to Darryl Hannah whose crazy assed antics made her fun to watch.Blade Runner's thinly developed story and characters are the only really glaring flaws and are the main reasons why I can't bring myself to love it as much as many other people do. That being said though, it still has a lot going for it and is a film that I would still recommend."

RoboMouse,"Jan 28, 2019",4/10,"Goodness! 'Blade Runner' (1982) scores 8.2/10 out of over 600,000 IMDb-users.
When that movie appeared, I was just finishing school and loved Ridley Scotts 'Alien' (1979), one of the greatest SF-movies ever made. Like so many others, I was eager to see Scott's next strike, but the disappointment was all over the place - most who went to see it uttered explicit warnings. It was perceived as extremely boring, with a thin narrative plot stretched to the limits, so that the entire movie seems to be in slow motion. No thrill at all, no tension. The only appreciated point was its dystopic, sinister style, making this a showcase for style-over-substance-movies, which it still is today.
But part of the community apparently loves this style and gets fascinated with the dark expression of the movie's content, irrespective of how thin and stretched it may be. While these people dominate internet platforms and movie magazines, they still make only a tiny fraction of the audience out there. Public numbers indicate that about 83 million people paid to see 'Alien' but only about 8 million came to 'Blade Runner' in 1982. Yet, 'Blade Runner' was the long expected successor, meaning that over 70 million potential cinema-visitors stayed away because most of those watching 'Blade Runner' where disappointed, which spread by word of mouth. Without 'Alien', 'Blade Runner' would have probably even gone unnoticed.
The number of this audience is two orders of magitude higher than the users voting 'Blade Runner' to a top-rated legendary classic. Therefore, in reality, the audience has voted this movie (by simply ignoring it) as one of the most overrated bores in SF-history."
pgaucher683,"May 16, 2015",10/10,"I.m a huge fan of R.Scott's work, i've watched Blade Runner in 82 and almost every year since...like yesterday evening :)In 79 R. Scott had made Alien the 8th passenger to compete against Star Wars for Fox, both changed Sci-fi movie forever, then he gave us Blade Runner and for me it's his masterpiece.It's a noir movie, a disappointed cop is hired by the L A metro police in a near future to kill replicant, human AI.It's raining all the time, no sky, it's really dark, down town LA is a mix of a open market for anything,animals clones and genetics shops, cheap hotels and squats, skyscrapers are huge, the Tyrel corp. looks like a modern over sized pyramid, most of the human beings who are always there, have diseases or have no money and cannot go to the space colonies.then i must say, the movie is really far better than the book 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' was.Harrison Ford is superb as all the cast. which is, for some of them, their best movie as of today, I became a fan of Rutger Hauer as well for his portrayal of Roy. do you know that, Roy's last words were a total improvisation of R.Hauer?the music by Vangelis is perfect. after all these years, it's still one of the best sci-fi movie ever made,you must see it"
galvestonsteve,"Sep 27, 2023",10/10,"I'm going to go out on a limb and say that Blade Runner is a work of art as important as The Mona Lisa or Picasso's Guernica. It asks the fundamental question of our lives...... what is it to be a human? What does being human really mean? Which is ironic, as the film's non human has the most poetic and heroic way of dying, even as his ""humanity"" outshines all the other humans. He shows that he has learned empathy, forgiveness and compassion.Philip Dick was a genius, and an amazing writer. His novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep was the model for Blade Runner, and while the film made major changes in Dick's story, it somehow, as if by magic or fate, is even greater than the book. The mystery is how that could happen? His main characters of Detective Deckard and Rachel are not like the book's, but they are also much more than the book's characters.There are a lot of changes in the way the book and movie play out and end. Entire major scenes and characters from the book are left out or only hinted at, yet the story as filmed, is nothing short of a masterpiece. The mood it presents us is one of darkness with little light. Even though great violence is shown, they somehow turned things into a classic love story in the end, something the book didn't even attempt.Needless to say, the casting, acting, directing and cinematography are all 10 out of 10. Every time I watch this film I have to pick my jaw off the floor. It's magical, and there will never be another one like it."
nashbeast2,"Mar 1, 2007",10/10,"Ridley Scott's film Blade Runner is, quite simply, the most awe-inspiring and breathtaking film made to this date. The opening shots of the movie will be permanently burned into your memory. This film has made such an impact on movie-making that it is almost impossible that another science fiction film can be made without any influence from this movie. The compelling story, the terrific direction and editing from frame to frame, and most of all, the cinematography will blow you away. The cast is perfect, each bringing something wonderful to their characters that you'll forever remember them from this performance. Rutger Hauer in particular shines, stealing the film with every scene he's in. This film should be on every top 10 list out there. Movie magic at its best!"
johnsmithsbasementreviews,"Oct 10, 2018",10/10,"Blade Runner is a prime example of how visionary and brilliant Ridley Scott can be when he tries. The film mixes extraordinary (well, for 1982) visual effects, great acting and a genuinely original and deep plot about what it means to be human.The plot, on a base level, concerns the exploits of ""Blade Runner"" Deckard as he hunts down rogue Reploids; advanced human-like androids that have a four-year lifespan to compensate for their other advantages. The rogue group, lead by Roy Batty, is looking to extend their aforementioned lifespans. This is really only a simple interpretation. The film is really about what it means to be a human being, especially when the reploids seem to demonstrate more humanity than the humans.Visually, the film looked in incredible in 1982, and still looks pretty good today. It's not just the backgrounds, but the incredible sets and mise en scene that truly bring the film to life in a way that makes it feel real. And as we approach 2019 (this review was written in Oct. 2018), the world of Blade Runner looks more and more eerily similar to our own.The performances in the film are just incredible. Harrison Ford as a depressing, inhumane drunk may not exactly sell itself, especially considering the types of roles he was known for playing at that point in time (i.e. charming rogue). However, Ford proves beyond all reasonable doubt that he can play his part, giving a stellar performance that allowed him to break free of the Han Solo typecast. But the real star of the show is Rutger Hauer, who gives a Shakespearean performance as Roy Batty.The soundtrack also deserves special mention for being varied and bizarre, and yet always managing to fit the scene perfectly. A deep, melancholy magnum opus, Blade Runner will surely be remembered as one of the greatest films ever made."
boccardoluca,"Aug 28, 2018",7/10,"I can understand why this movie is considered a masterpiece, unfortunately i haven't really enjoyed the movie, the action scenes where so messy,like some part of the plot. but i really enjoyed how the future is rapresented in blade runner, expeccialy the ambient, the neon light, the dark. i gave 7 because i think that the film is really good, but have scenes taht i haven't enjoyed.maybe i haven't understand completely the movie, and i should watch it again"
kambiztb,"Jan 10, 2019",9/10,"When I saw it, I wanted to be in high technology. When he spoke to the computer and instructing it to move, zoom in, left, right, print.... I ended up eventually doing the same things in my line of business. At first not as fancy, then we just made leaps over what was fantasy in that movie. We are still working on the genetics aspect. My job takes me to places that amazing young people work on applications that seem unrealistic to me. Person specific medication is one. No longer needing to take medicine with side effects or too much of one chemical and too little of the other. Laser sharp medication is more like it. Based on your DNA and anything that makes you what you are chemically, a mixture of medication with exact doses of each ingredient will be produced and it will target the problem that you have. Instead of a shotgun approach. I am told that it's not there yet for mental health issues but it works on addiction. Mental health issues are another category in themselves. Probably 30 years from now one of these people told me. Maybe never she said. If it is so darn complicated I wonder if there is hope for the poor souls living every day of their lives with one for or another of anxiety. Like the characters in this movie. The poor replicas did not even have a say in their existence. No different than us really. But their lives came with an expiration date. Ours is a highway that we take and choose when to get gas, pee or what sideroads to take. Much different."
didi-5,"Mar 15, 2004",7/10,"Intelligent sci-fi.  Harrison Ford plays Deckard, a replicant exterminator (or is he?); the replicants are Daryl Hannah, Sean Young, Brion James, and best of all, Rutger Hauer - who gets the best closing speech, all that guff about lights and stars.  The other replicants are ok, particularly Hannah with her wild hair and her acrobatic attacks.Blade Runner looks great in its futuristic, claustrophobic bubble, and even Ford's cardboard acting can't spoil the mix.  The director's cut removes his dull narration and is the better for it.  This movie is reasonably intelligent science fiction, involving and interesting.  It has images which linger long in the memory years after seeing it."
david-dtn,"Feb 6, 2007",10/10,"On first viewing of Blade Runner most people will be left confused and probably a little disappointed. Even thought the studio had there way to some extent (cutting part of Scotts original vision in order to increase profits) this was not a film made to appeal to a mass market audience. Anyone looking for a generic action film with an obvious conclusion will be disappointed. For these reasons it did fail commercially on its first release in 1982.It could be best described as a film noir set in the future. Power hungry corporations harness control over a mixed race of neo-Tokyo lower-class citizens living in a decadent Los-Angeles slum. Enter Rick Decard a retired private eye who gets unwillingly hired to hunt down and eliminate a group of replicants who have escaped an off-world colony and arrived on earth to in order to extend their four year limited life span.Based on the Philip K. Dick novel ""Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep"", there are many existential themes running throughout and many questions purposely left unanswered so the viewer can come to his own conclusion. What is the nature of our existence? What does it mean to be human? Do we fully appreciate life? Are but a few.Everything about this film works. The cinematography is outstanding with every scene meticulously shot. The set and design are also stunning and still sets the standard for which every sci-fi film aspires too.The actors are also cast perfectly. Harrison Ford plays Rick Decard a man troubled by the demons of the past with seemingly no escape from his violent reality. Rutgar Hauer is Roy Batty the replicant leader haunted by his mortality, unable to find a cure. The supporting cast also put in memorable performances. A special mention to the futuristic, synthetic score by Vangelis that draws the viewer deeper into Scotts dystopian view of the future. It gets better with repeat viewings in that you slowly uncover new insights into the character motivations and the heavy use of symbolism. Its a near flawless film and could entertain endless hours of discussion. Watch both the directors cut and voice over editions to fully appreciate this masterpiece."
tom-3160,"Jan 16, 2011",7/10,"Its got a good story line, but the thing that sets this off from the normal film is that each and every set and part of the film have been impeccably shot, to create a truly mesmerising surface for the actors to act upon. Each of the scenes has some brilliant space age gadgets and viewpoints. The part I particularly talk about from this film is his home, with its stony coloured, decorated walls, lighting schemes and particularly the view and lighting streaming into the room.A good film and a must see for as sci-fi and similar film genre, like Brazil, Logan's Run etc Good acting meets brilliant visuals and directing, in this masterpiece by Ridley Scott and Harrison Ford."
roddekker,"Jan 3, 2015",1/10,"Hey! Get this straight. If you don't like Blade Runner, you don't understand it. Why? Because you don't. You're not allowed to dislike it.Over the years Blade Runner has gathered around itself such a huge fan-base (that's so out of whack) that anyone who says they dislike it is instantly discredited and dismissed as an idiot. So, you better like Blade Runner, or you're an idiot, got it?Blade Runner is a completely brain-dead, wannabe, intellectual, Sci-Fi film that spends 2 hours delivering a careless and poorly managed love story and then ""Wham! Bam!"" at the end it's suddenly a statement about the meaning of life. (Sorry, but the last 10 minutes don't make up for the first 2 hours.)And the question was raised - ""Was Deckard really a replicant?"" Who cares! Harrison Ford's portrayal was about as realistic as that of a robot. And about half the time he walked around looking like he'd just been punched in the nuts.Is Blade Runner a finely sculpted masterpiece of cinematic excellence? No, it is not!!If this film is really Ridley Scott's idea of poignant commentary, then it sure makes me glad to know that he doesn't have an ego."
shawaidan,"Nov 12, 2018",10/10,"Very good adaptation of ""Do androids dream about electric sheep?"" by Philip K Dick.
What makes us human?
When a robot is human?
Is it moral to ""retire"" a robot who feels like a human?
What a robot who doesn't know he/she is a robot?
A very good book and a very good movie should make ask yourself questions. This movie does exactly that."
enigmaticursa,"Nov 24, 2018",10/10,"Yeah... weirdest freaking movie. Awesome though. Acting, music, cinematography, it is all great. Yes it is a strange movie, but the best ones often are. 10/10 recommend! It's pretty sci-fi, a little suspenseful at some points, and definitely NOT a movie to watch with your children. Haha. Has some fantastic action scenes, yet also stunning visuals that blow the audience away. Effects are great considering the year Blade Runner was produced. If given the chance, definitely watch this movie."
The_Void,"Jul 14, 2005",9/10,"Based on a novel by Philip K. Dick, this futuristic urban Sci-Fi film is a masterpiece indeed. Director Ridley Scott has managed to turn Dick's story into a dark and complex film-noir styled mystery, that packs as much punch on an aesthetic level as it does on an emotional and substantial one. It's clear throughout the film that the movie makers' intentions was to make this more of an intelligent character study cum thought-provoking drama rather than the thrill seeking movie that the Sci-Fi genre movies usually are. This is shown by the way that the action in the movie is kept down to a bare minimum, and the way that the film always seems to want to put forward an idea rather than an action sequence. The plot, which covers themes such as what it takes to be considered alive, follows a group of four androids (""Replicants"") that have escaped their masters and come to Earth, where Replicants are illegal. Their intention is to seek out 'the maker' and try to add to their maximum four-year lifespan, given to them to ensure that they wont have sufficient time to develop emotions. On their tail is Deckard; a policeman in the business of hunting Replicants; known as a Blade Runner.Through a grim setting and dark characterization; Ridley Scott has truly succeeded in giving Blade Runner a classic film-noir style. This bodes well with the futuristic metropolitan version of Los Angeles that the film takes place in. Both of these elements blend excellently with the characters, which are intriguing as they are dark. Harrison Ford steps into the role of Deckard; the classic noir protagonist. We never really delve into his character; but at the same time, that ensures that the mystery surrounding him is kept up, which serves in making our protagonist all the more intriguing. Rutger Hauer, who gives a career-best performance as the leader of the Replicants, matches him. Hauer treads the line between pathos and pure evil brilliantly, and it's always easy to believe that he is the doomed android that the movie presents him as. The main thing I love about this movie is it's style; the dark Gothic undertones are superb to look at, and once the film enters it's final third, the atmosphere takes over and the way that it builds to it's beautiful and classic conclusion is absolutely superb. Blade Runner may have been met with negativity on it's release; but today it's an absolute classic."
baldbassman,"Apr 23, 2007",10/10,"A masterpiece. It is one of the very few films that has left me stumbling out of the cinema, stunned.At face value, those who have no interest in the issues the film raises may see only a fantastic-looking, atmospheric sci-fi movie. It certainly is those things, but so much more besides.For me, it questions many of life's great imponderables in a way no other movie ever has. It is uncompromising in its vision of the frailty and deep flaws of mankind, and its uncertain future, and provides no easy answers, but when I saw it, it touched something deep inside that has stayed with me ever since. The quote in the summary above says it all. If you haven't seen it yet, I urge you to without delay. Utterly life-changing."
bd74,"Jan 16, 1999",N/A,"The movie looks like a comic book come to life.  But as far as a good impression goes, it doesn't go beyond the visuals.  Ridley Scott should've placed more emphasis on making the story more entertaining.  One thing I did think was wonderful about this film is the opening scene--a view of the future Los Angeles at night, with its skyscrapers and flying vehicles. Nonetheless, this movie is slow-moving and very boring; this is the type of film to watch if you ever have trouble sleeping at night and you need something to make you fall asleep quickly!"
Smbrero,"Jul 27, 2025",6/10,"Blade Runner, directed by Ridley Scott, is set in a dystopian 2019 Los Angeles where synthetic humans known as replicants are hunted down by special police units called Blade Runners. Harrison Ford plays Rick Deckard, a former Blade Runner brought out of retirement to track down four rogue replicants who have returned to Earth seeking to extend their lifespans.What truly stands out about this film is its atmosphere. The dark, rainy, neon-soaked cityscape is iconic - even now, decades later, the world-building feels rich, immersive, and groundbreaking. The score by Vangelis complements the visuals perfectly, creating a haunting image.However, despite its visual brilliance, Blade Runner didn't fully land with me. While I can appreciate how revolutionary it must have been back in 1982, the story didn't grip me the way I hoped. The pacing felt sluggish, and the plot - although layered with philosophical and ethical themes - came across as underwhelming. I wanted to love it, especially given its legendary status, but it just didn't connect emotionally or narratively.Harrison Ford delivers a solid performance, but I couldn't help but feel like he was again playing the stoic macho type without offering much depth or nuance. There are certainly more compelling explorations of identity, mortality, and what it means to be human in other films that followed.Still, Blade Runner deserves credit for the doors it opened. It's a visual masterpiece and a major influence on the sci-fi genre - just not one that resonated deeply with me."
Hitchcoc,"Jan 22, 2010",9/10,"I understand that things were done to the original film which I saw in a movie theater. It's been so long that I have no basis for comparison. Watching the Director's cut, I found it as engaging as I remember. It's sad when we have a hero who is basically a cold blooded murderer. The evil rest with ourselves. Can we really destroy a sentient being and have a moral justification. Once these replicants began to think for themselves, do we lose our right to them. Think of Mary Shelley's Frankenstein as Victor chases the monster across the ice. The creature cries out to him as his maker that he is part of him. These are seen as monsters, but they have no control over what they have become. Their memories are theirs, even though they were implanted. This is such a bleak view of our future and it plays very well in 2010. It is a feast for the eyes and is much better science fiction than most films made since. Ford's performance is intense and driven. This is an excellent film. I was curious why Leonard Maltin gave it one-and-a-half stars."
leemunson,"Dec 30, 2007",6/10,"When I first saw this film in the Eighties I remember not liking it, even though everyone I knew thought it was great. Seeing the ""Final Cut"" again reminds me that I was right. Not that there aren't great things in it: The production design of course is justifiably famous, the acting is first-rate (actually any cast that includes M Emmet Walsh, Brion James, and James Hong is pretty impressive,) and the score is terrific.A film is (or should be) more than a series of cool looking photos. It needs a compelling story. This story seems unfocused and unbalanced. For instance, early on there's a long sequence in which Deckard uses his detective skills to track down Zhora, but later, he is sent by his captain to the building where the remaining replicants are (conveniently) waiting. It seems like an entire reel is missing here.Also the ending is just uninteresting. On the FAQ page you can read the endings the screenwriters imagined. They're logical and dramatic. It's like Ridley Scott spent all his money on that cool blimp and billboards--and they are pretty cool--and he didn't have enough left over to film a proper ending. To me the ending is the most important part of any work. It's like in gymnastics. You can do a great routine, but the landing is the last thing the judges see. You've got to stick it."
eklavya-cwk,"May 20, 2014",6/10,"R. Scott is a name quite familiar. Blade Runner is a movie made by him...yes. Now it is rated really high with a special attraction point to the experts as a movie with a lot of freedom to conclude what it mean and what are its secret things, also its a best dystopian sci-fi film made till date. Yes, I agree to everything but only for few micro-seconds, when by some quantum fluctuations and tunneling effect due to uncertainty principle I move out of my head and mind (to the hell).Lets see what has it got, the initial scenes were amazing and huge. They will make one feel that their is a grandeur that the movie is about to show them. And then everything happens ambiguously, means you can conclude whatever you can understand by the sequence taking place. A huge range of senseless events, unnecessary artificial emotion development, vulgarity and gross-ness at its majority are few speciality of Blade Runner. I couldn't understand anything because I am a dumb fool and the film is really great. I was feeling like sleeping and yawning during the last one and half hour, every second expecting something good is gonna arrive after all its rated 8.3 isn't it? so all intelligent minded good folks are recommended to watch this movie and rest try to avoid it and watch it just to complete your watch list."
gftbiloxi,"Aug 1, 2005",8/10,"To say BLADE RUNNER is an incredible looking film is a gross understatement.The art direction--whether costume, scenic design, or special effects--is simply stunning, creating an extremely dark, sometimes beautiful, but always fascinating vision of a future Los Angeles that has begun to collapse into grotesque decay. Hardcore science fiction fans will instantly recognize that the city's spectacular highrises reference Fritz Lang's silent METROPOLIS; art history buffs should notice a distinct Frank Lloyd Wright tinge to some of the set designs; costume designs are clearly intended to evoke the spirit of 1940s film noir. The resulting melange is simply extraordinary, very powerful, and incredibly atmospheric.The cast gives able, stylish performances in keeping with the film's dark but glossy tone, but the script they play is a very muddy one. The story concerns a special agent (Harrison) who is assigned the task of locating and ""retiring"" (i.e. killing) a handful of violent androids who have illegally landed on earth. While I greatly admire the film's decidedly ""open-ended"" conclusion, I do not greatly admire the on-going vagueness that besets the storyline as a whole.We are persistently asked to ask believe that Harrison Ford locates his quarry via the vaguest information imaginable; moreover, although specifically described as a highly experienced and formidable agent, Ford's character gives little evidence of it: he's always being bashed around to the point of death and then overcoming his opponent more through dumb luck than superior skill. Most annoying of all, the film flirts with issues concerning creation of artificial life without actually amplifying any of them in a consistently engaging way.In spite of these failings, the performances and most particularly the incredibly compelling make BLADE RUNNER a fantastic triumph of style over substance. It is extremely enjoyable, and it is easy to understand how the film has drawn so many enthusiastic fans.The DVD presently available is a ""director's cut"" version and offers both widescreen and modified-for-television formats. The former is recommended, for the latter undercuts the visual fascination of the film. The picture quality of the widescreen format is superior; the sound is good but not exceptional. Aside from the choice of formats and brief biographies of the principal players, there are no extras of any kind.Gary F. Taylor, aka GFT, Amazon Reviewer"
siderite,"Aug 3, 2014",10/10,"Ahh, the 80's, when people could imagine the future as a dark, polluted thing, where people have lost their freedom to corporations. Of course, we now know that this would never happen. *cough*Philip K. Dick has a difficult writing style, something wild in it that makes it hard to grasp, to control. However a lot of his work molds well to the screen and Blade Runner is no exception. What makes the film exceptional, though, is not the pulp mystery feel of the story or the inspiration of the sets and clothes from mid 19th century US or even the excellent acting. Instead it is the attention to detail that Ridley Scott demonstrated when doing it all. This is clearly the work of an obsessive man who saw the film in his head way before it started to make it. This is rare nowadays due to budgets and to the fact that most of popular cinema is not an art anymore, only a business.Watch the film and notice how the characters are not really well defined, leaving room for the imagination, while the sets and the props are clearly very detailed and the world in which the story unfolds makes the characters both gain weight and lose focus. The human condition is actually the main character.Bottom line: a beautifully made film, by a dedicated director, with excellent acting and a story that works on multiple levels at the same time. Rightly considered a masterpiece, you should watch it at least once."
atomicpunk40,"Nov 27, 2019",7/10,"Okay what has NOT been said about Ridley Scott's mind blowing look at November of the year 2019 with Harrison Ford's policeman dragged out of retirement and hunting down a group of dangerous androids trying to avoid their own death, so I'll make my review to the point. As for the date, well, since no day of the month is given, just November 2019, I guess you can
say that the movie takes place today, the 27th of November, at least I prefer it to.The good -
The special effects. Even today the special effects are astonishing. The sets are eye popping as well. The look of a future L. A., overpopulated, trashy, and being
so clogged up with smog that its always nighttime dark 24/7 - only the tallest buildings can look over the smog and see sunlight - while raining most of the time because of the pollution, now this was a great idea. Even Philip K. Dick, who happened to see some dailies
of Blade Runner before he passed on said the world that the movie set forth was very close to the one he imagined when he wrote ""Do Androids Dream of
Electric Sheep"", the novel the movie is based upon. As for the music. Vangelis' moody score adds even more depth. Then there is Harrison Ford's performance as Rick Deckard. Ford is well cast. He really gives a level to the character I don't think anybody else could pull off. In fact everybody's performance is good - especially Rutger Hauer's. He gives one of the the most vile, yet sympathetic villain performance you will ever see.The bad -
Well the story does kind of bog down a little. Is Deckard really a flesh and blood human, a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? Or is he a Replicant himself, recently programmed to think his existence is that of a tired old Blade Runner who hates his job and guzzles booze? The war between Scott and Ford on this subject is legendary and one of the main reasons the two did not get along. Scott said Deckard was a Replicant and left subtle clues
about it. Ford said the opposite and did the same as Scott to get his point across as well. This is what throws the movie off a bit. Is he one of them... yes or no? Well you'll just have to decide that for yourself... and sometimes that kind of ideology is only limited to how much it works. Like here.Another thing I will disagree with is the notion that Ford's narration is pointless, like Scott - and Ford as well - thought (they were forced by Warner Bros to put the narration in after preview audiences got confused on the narration-less storyline). It is why it is not in the Director's Cut, Scott removed it. But I feel it adds greatly to the atmosphere in Blade Runner, not takes away. And as a result the movie looses some of it's impact without it. The same goes for the original ""happy"" theatrical ending, which got the same treatment as the narration. The ending adds to the feel, not takes away. All of this is why I prefer the original Theatrical Cut over any other.The great -
Rutger Hauer's soliloquy at the end. No spoilers here as everybody has heard about this thing. Hell, it is even on the movie's soundtrack!. But when I saw Blade Runner back in 1982 (yes, I actually saw it in the
movie theater when it was released back then!) the soliloquy was not that well known at the time and it came out of left field for me. It made my
jaw drop! To me it sums up what the feel of the film is about, and that is being alive and existing and the personal experiences that makes us who we are. It is brief, poetic, and beautifully spoken by Hauer (who, incidentally, made it all up on his own!). I guarantee you, from the time you hear it, it will haunt you from that moment on.Even now this movie STILL demands your attention. Forget those who says the special effects and the fantastic sets are the movie's stars and not Ford, Hauer, Daryl Hannah, Brion James, or anybody else. No, it's ALL good.My rating (from Excellent to Poor) - Good. To any serious science fiction lover this is a must."
jacobtgill,"Jun 12, 2018",7/10,"I gotta make sure I throw this disclaimer in near the beginning: Blade Runner is not an action sci-fi flick. Yes, it's from Alien director Ridley Scott who would later give us movies such as Gladiator and The Martian. But Blade Runner is much different. It certainly has sci-fi appeal and influence-- video games such as Final Fantasy VII and Mass Effect clearly took notes from the film, and directors such as Christopher Nolan have cited this film as inspiration, but it also doesn't fall into the trippier territory of films such as 2001: A Space Odyssey. Based on the cleverly titled book Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick (he died before the release of the film, but praised what he saw which was about the first 20 minutes), this movie is much more philosophical. Perhaps Blade Jogger would be a more fitting title-the pacing is very deliberate and not at all what I was expecting.The movie stars Harrison Ford who was determined to not wear a hat because he was just coming from Raiders of the Lost Ark. The year is 2019 and genetic engineering has advanced so far as to create androids, or replicants, that are superior in intelligence and physicality. Their telltale sign is their responses to questions that are supposed to evoke human emotions. Created to work as slaves, replicants have rebelled in off-world colonies (remember this is 3 years from now) and are declared illegal on Earth and are to be terminated (they use the word retired) if found. This is where Ford comes in when it's discovered that 6 replicants have returned to Earth. Obviously, this has all the ingredients to be a thrilling action flick. But it takes a much different direction. Replicants are designed with a failsafe that automatically retires them after 4 years. It produces cool, thinking quotes like, ""It's too bad she won't live. But then again, who does?""Ridley Scott liked the idea of Ford being a replicant, but Ford has stated that he despised that idea and said that before filming Scott agreed with him that his character is definitely human. Now I won't spoil anything, but I will say that it's a question toiled with during the film. Also, if you watch the movie, watch the director's cut version (which technically isn't fully Scott's cut) because the ending is much much better than the theatrical cut of the film.Really, above sci-fi or philosophical or whatever, I'd describe this film as weird. I'm not sure what you're expecting from the film going in, but it's not what you're going to get. There isn't ever a clear tone established, and this just adds to the difficulty of describing just what the film is. Even the highly-regarded score switches from slow, dark melodies to jazzier moments. I will say, however, probably the most consistent element of the film is the lighting. It's certainly always on the darker side, but all the ways the light comes through in every scene is skillfully crafted.In all honesty I can't even say I'm much of a fan of this film. I didn't care for how it was edited, and some of the sub-plots really were weird. The movie succeeds in getting you to think, but it also makes you wonder what you just watched. I'm not sure how many times or how precisely I can say it, but it's a strange film. Not strange like drug-fueled Trainspotting, and not confusing like Stanley Kubrick, but more cerebral like the very ends of the films 28 Days Later and Sunshine. I can't say you will enjoy this film (possibly because I can't say I enjoyed it), but I'm extremely curious about the sequel, and for that alone it might be worth checking this film out. And in case of rain, make sure to grab yourself a light-up umbrella. Those things are so cool.

Picktator_Pete,"Jul 29, 2002",1/10,"I consider myself somewhat of a movie buff, and several of my friends had highly recommended this movie to me. So a few other friends of mine (who'd also never seen it) and I watched it one night, and we very nearly turned it off. It was not the movie we were expecting, and we were certainly not pleasantly surprised. It was marketed to us as an action film, yet the actual action sequences were few, far between, and frankly rather boring, especially in contrast with Harrison Ford's usual daring escapades. I generally enjoy think pieces, but this one was an exception. I found the plot to be a bit hard to follow, and nothing about it made me want to put in the effort or the second viewing needed to fully comprehend what was happening. For example, the nudity was completely gratuitous, and Harrison Ford gave, in my opinion, the weakest performance of any movie I've seen him in. I don't want to give away the ending, as it seems that most people love this movie, but I felt it was not a good resolution to the story, and that in particular a speech given by one of the characters was trite and not nearly as life-changing as it thought it was. (I've been told I missed the point, and I guess that must be true because I couldn't even find a point...) I personally would not recommend this movie to anyone, although it seems I'm in the minority, so watch it if you want. But don't say I didn't warn you..."

highscore-69812,"Apr 19, 2025",10/10,"This is Ridley Scott's finest hour. This is a sci-fi noir masterpiece from the beginning to the end. It's not just the atmosphere. It's the excellent acting. It's the incredible soundtrack from the legendary Vangelis (how can you write a review and not mention this) and the plot. YES, the plot.It's unbelievable so many people (kids mostly) can't grasp what is goin on. This movie is 42 years old and we STILL ask each other if Harrison Ford was human or not, we still argue about so many things. This is not a movie you watch eating burgers, playing with your cellphone and talking to people.It needs your attention, it needs your sense of art, if you have one.This is a timeless masterpiece, this is food for thought even in 2025. What makes a human, what is a machine? Scott can't make a good historic movie, but when it comes to sci-fi, he is a grandmaster.10/10."
DHWaldron,"Oct 13, 2017",N/A,"""Blade Runner"" stars Harrison Ford, and is about a detective, known as a blade runner, who must kill replicants (robots). The concept itself is interesting enough, allowing for an endless amount of paths for the film to approach. ""Blade Runner"" has an incredibly grim yet beautiful landscape with a seemingly endless torrent of rain which adds atmosphere like hardly any other sci-fi. Deckard (Harrison Ford) is involved in a huge case which results in amazing battle and action sequences. The sets are masterfully created, but the second half of the film is where the pace and story-line heighten with incredible battles and scenes involving Rutger Hauer as Roy (the main replicant antagonist) who delivers a performance making him one of the most memorable antagonists of all time, equalled by the Xenomorph of ""Alien"". Three years, in fact, after the release of ""Alien"", Ridley Scott has once more made a spectacular, cult-classic science-fiction film; only this one challenges what the world may eventually succumb to in just two years time."
JacksonW0523,"May 10, 2020",7/10,First of the visuals and cinematography is amazing for its time. The world that this film sets up feels real. The set the design is great. It's like a future with advanced technology but still feels gloomy. Kind of like the dump that was New York City back in the 70s but in the future. This movie had a great theme and it's complex but it might take a couple viewings to see it. I went into this thinking it was a sci-fi action film but it isn't. So not really my taste but I still found it quite enjoyable.
mjw2305,"Jan 16, 2005",9/10,"This masterpiece, is probably the finest Sci-Fi movie ever made, and i can't see a reason for it not to have a place in everyones collection.The story, direction and cast are all perfect, and although i agree that the directors cut is better, i still believe that the original Harrison Ford voice over is pretty good, even if the end of that version was s**t.I first saw the movie when i was about 15 years old, and it blew me away (and yes that was the original cut of the film). At that age without the voice over the film would have been too difficult to follow, so i do have my reasons for liking that version. I also think that the original cut of the movie probably has wider appeal.My advice is this, see the original cut and if you like it watch the directors cut. If you jump straight into the directors cut, and don't give the movie your whole hearted attention, you will miss out on a masterpiece in cinematic history.Original Cut 8/10 Directors Cut 10/10"
ozjeppe,"Jan 5, 2009",7/10,"Note that this is a combination review; I saw the original once in 1982 and the Dir's Cut now in 2009 - which changes the ending/final voice-over - but that doesn't really diminish the overall effect of my lasting liking of this sci-fi action classic:Very straight, cold focus on story (of Ford as future hunter of runaway androids in L.A, the year 2019) instead of character development, (as many critics point out) but I don't really care... since production design and special effects techniques are still justifiably fantastic and beautiful. And what's more, I now notice how hauntingly poetic (ah, Vangelis' ethereal music score!), darkly enigmatic and contemplative it is, among its bursts of thrilling, unforgettably violent action. And what about that mesmerizing, Gothic climax with Rutger Hauer's menacing presence?! Wowser.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe."
Phuzzbomb,"Nov 17, 2009",10/10,"OK, it's my favourite film of all time. I like my SciFi but this film stands out in any category. The casting and performances are excellent. Harrision Ford brings out the true depth of the character, bounty hunter or killer. The setting is excellent, even now, 27 years later it still looks futuristic and possible.The true dilemma is of course is is Decker human or android. The fact that it makes it unclear and indeed asks the question is there a difference is the films true strength.This will be one of very few films I would give a 10 to but it is definitely worth it."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Oct 6, 2017",7/10,"'Blade Runner (1982)' is a slow-burn, for sure, and its
nuts-and-bolts plot is almost nothing compared to the supplementary story that runs along side it, but this science-fiction film-noir is a remarkably intelligent and self-assured piece that tackles grand themes and interesting ideas with a real confident verve. It also treats its audience with respect, to the point that many will miss a lot of the subtle yet significant subtext placed within the tangibly grimy future the flick convincingly presents. While the unpolished yet awe-inspiring visual vistas and hauntingly beautiful synth soundtrack are what immediately grab your attention, it's the quiet contemplative moments where the picture finds its own identity as one which values the existential questions its audience must inevitably ask far more than action set-pieces or an 'appeal to all' mentality. It's a very unique and introspective picture that never calls attention to itself but should keep you thinking long after its sombre and ambiguous end. 7/10."
jeffgintz,"Nov 28, 2021",4/10,"This is a slow moving, boring movie. I saw it in the 1980s and was bored then. I thought maybe I was too you (11 or 12) at the time to understand it. Well, I watched it again nearly 40 years later and was still bored nearly to tears. There are some redeeming aspects - Harrison Ford is all Harrison Fordy in a good way and a young Daryl Hannah gives a nice performance."
facebobook,"Aug 15, 2017",10/10,"Awesome story, directed very well and fantastic acting all around. Definitely one of the big sci-fi classics. Ridley Scott should check out some of his old work cause Alien: Covenant sucked very very hard. Can't wait for the 2049 version coming out in a couple of months, Ford and Gosling could be a match made in heaven. For all people who haven't watched Blade Runner yet, GO WATCH IT! And read the book for sure."
Style_is_Substance,"May 31, 2016",10/10,"This philosophical analysis of the film Blade Runner is an abridged version of a school paper I wrote during my first semester at college. Upon evaluation, I feel there is much more I could add to this.This is my personal subjective and analysis of the film and the philosophical writings of Turing and Hume referenced below. Alan Turing gave his answer to the question of whether or not machines could ever be capable of thinking like a human being as a 'yes.' Many philosophers and great thinkers of history stated the answer would be, ""no."" While it is often agreed that computers can think in certain but not all ways, it raises the question, ""how would we even know if a computer is thinking like a human being or not?"" Turing stated that it is polite to assume everybody thinks as the only person one can know positively thinks is one's self. With this in mind, it can be concluded that machines can one day be assumed to have human thought just as validly as any person besides one's self does. Turing looked at a party imitation game as an inspiration to develop the Turing Test, a game in which a judge must decipher if he is speaking to a computer or a person and if the computer can be mistaken to be human, it can be concluded to possibly have human-like thought.In the film, four bio-engineered humanoids – known as replicants – come to Earth illegally and become targets for execution. The process of replicant execution is referred to as retirement, perhaps because the layman would look at replicants as not humans, therefore their executions would not be considered genuine deaths. The film utilizes the fictional Voight-Kampff Test – a test parallel to the Turing Test designed to determine if someone is a replicant or not by asking a series of questions and looking closely at iris dilations and pupil fluctuations to decipher if their emotional response is not human. Towards the beginning of the film, the replicant character Leon is given the test with suspicion of him being a replicant. Before murdering the questionnaire, Leon responds to several questions in an evasive and curious human-like way easily, thus passing the Turing Test before the Voight-Kampff Test really began. The character Rachael believes herself to be human but is then given a the test by Deckard and is then discovered to be a replicant. The line between artificial intelligence and human intelligence becomes blurred, so much that only the slightest details would give away the difference. According to the film, artificial intelligent beings are in fact able to pass the Turing Test and therefore are able to think for themselves.With this in mind, mankind ever does create a machine that claims to be able to think and potentially turn away from initial programming, I believe we should not automatically assume they do not genuinely think, and possibly treat such a machine as a living organism. David Hume once wrote: ""As a memory alone acquaints us with the continuance and extent of this succession of perceptions, 'tis to be considered, upon that account chiefly, as the source of personal identity. Had we no memory, we never shou'd have any notion of causation, nor onsequently the identity of our persons beyond our memory . . ."" and "". . . memory does not so much produce as discover personal identity, by shewing us the relation of cause and effect among our different perceptions."" I interpret and summarize Hume's writings as stating memory is not what makes somebody a person as other philosophers may believe, but rather helps one know their personal identity.The character Racheal learns she not only is a replicant destined to die within a short amount of time, but that her memories had been programmed by her creator, Tyrell. Racheal essentially loses nearly all understanding of her personal identity but as she exists, she does not lose her personal identity altogether.While not officially stating it, the film hints that Deckard, is not only assigned to retire replicants, but also a replicant himself. This is further explored in The Final Cut in which Deckard dreams about a unicorn and at the end of the film finds an origami unicorn on the floor presumably left by his work partner, Gaff, who had previously been shown with an origami match-stick man. Towards the end of the film, Gaff tells Deckard that he has done a man's job while before treating him more unfairly, further suggesting Deckard may be a replicant. With this in mind, it appears Gaff not only knows Deckard's basic whereabouts and thoughts, but possibly created Deckard with programmed memories that may belong to Gaff. If this theory is true, Deckard's understanding of his personal identity is false, but his actual personal identity is not, as memories do not create personal identities but helps people understand their personal identity. The character Roy Batty, moments before death, says the following lines to Deckard:""I've seen things you people wouldn't believe. Attack ships on fire off the shoulder of Orion. I watched C-beams glitter in the dark near the Tannhauser gate. All those moments will be lost in time like tears in the rain Time to die...""One could conclude with Hume's writings that Batty's memories are not what makes him a person but helps him understand his personal identity. With his memories gone, his understanding of personal identity would cease to exist, but by saving Deckard's life and sharing his memories, he allows his personal identity to continue existing as Deckard would remember him. As Batty dies, a dove he was holding is released and then flies into the air, suggesting his soul left his body and makes its way to Heaven. As his personal identity lives on and despite being artificial, he is in fact a person."
rascal-14,"Apr 12, 1999",N/A,"This movie, to the naive movie watcher, may come off as an action/special effects/detective film.  It's not.  In fact, it's much, much more.  If you want special effects, loads of action, martial arts, blood and gore, then delete Runner from the title and go see Blade (Wesley Snipes, Stephen Dorff).  Once you've had your action fill, then take on Blade Runner.  Dim, dark, and subtle - you will not be disappointed, though your brain might hurt.  If you are disappointed, watch it again, so you don't miss anything. If you are still disappointed, then you obviously aren't looking for this type of movie.  I personally would recommend the Director's Cut due to its overall atmosphere, but for a basic plot understanding, you may want to see the first cut. This movie is everything science fiction should be, and was intended to be. The questions of self-destruction, human life, and morality are heavily stressed throughout the entire work.  Acting is incredible - you see Harrison Ford at his best, excellent work from Rutger Hauer, along with every single character and extra in the entire film.  The scenes of Los Angeles are incredible.  The music is incredible.  The writing is incredible.  Everything together is more than incredible. If you haven't yet, go see Blade Runner.  It will change your view of Science Fiction."
camronborealis,"Oct 31, 2024",7/10,"This definitely has a feel of a movie that was, for it's time, expansive and groundbreaking. Futuristic sets, urban scenery that is both crowded and hollow, and a lore that feels much deeper than you are seeing. Hallmarks of a fantastic movie.However, it also feels a bit faded, as though it's aging prematurely. It's hard to make sense of the subtler points of the film, the characters surprise me and not in a good way. Perhaps the audience was expected to do more work when watching in the early 80s? A scene that left me feeling creeped out also left me wondering if perhaps there's more than I could extract from the characters."
o-lugo91,"Jan 31, 2012",8/10,"This is a film that is so deep, rich, and multi-layered, it may require more than one viewing to fully absorb the brilliance of what you've just seen. At first glance, it can be a bit slow. It's told in a classic film noir fashion, so this is to be expected. Director Ridley Scott seems to want to savor every shot, and an astute audience will be able to sense this.Now, I say the film is told in a classic Noir style, but this can be misleading. There is no Humphrey Bogart in Blade Runner, snapping off brilliant one-liners once a second. Only hopeless people, in many ways victims of the merciless world of which they are all a part. Deckard is a typically downbeat protagonist, a hard-boiled cynical leading man with a weakness for heavy drinking. The plot is a mystery in name only, as the audience is allowed to know what Roy Batty, Pris and Leon are all up to before Deckard ever finds out. This only lends to the dread and inevitability of the film, lending further to its pervasive gloom. There is no final scene at the end where the bold detective puts all the pieces together and says ""Ah-Ha!"". Instead, we find Rick Deckard questioning his own existence and drinking away his constant doubts, all the while embroiled in a romantic relationship with someone he's sworn to kill.Blade Runner requires audience participation, particularly in the Director's Cut, which is entirely devoid of some rather necessary exposition provided by the Original Cut's much-maligned voice-over. Certain facts will not be clear even at the end of the film, requiring personal interpretation in order to be appreciated fully. Other facts will be given away in much more subtle ways than in most modern cinema, such as through visual cues and tenuous dialogue."
sorintalpis,"Nov 23, 2021",7/10,"For a movie made in1982, i think its a good one for that time.To see it in 2021, its laughable. It has so many goofs, chaotic scenes, plot holes, scene pieces filmed in different times and glued together that
today this movie wouldn't even hit DVD release in this state. It looks made by a school kid as a summer project.Was interesting to see how they imagined world 40 years later. With a few things, they were spot on."
wattcima,"Dec 9, 2008",8/10,"I don't know why I spent so many years really disliking BLADE RUNNER.From the first time I saw it back in the summer of 1982 I disliked it. Maybe it was because I'd spent the previous year or so seeing trailers and ""making of"" segments that made it look so good that basically nothing could possibly live up to such expectations (and what could be better than ALIEN?)Then there were Deckard's square glasses (you can't drink well out of a square glass), all that tedious smoky light drifting through blinds, and that dove being released in slow motion to make us feel just sowhatever.I guess I do know why I spent so many years disliking it.Yet, slow motion dove notwithstanding, I find this new cut tremendously entertaining. I never imagined that more explicitly making Deckard a replicant could make it so much more fun. (Okay, here it is for the sceptics: Gaff's origami unicorn tells us he knows Deckard dreams of unicorns. He could only know this if said dreams were implants)Sure, it was always in the mix that Deckard was potentially a replicant. People suggested as much back in '82. The suspicion is alluded to in the movie – ""Have you ever tried taking that test yourself?""Now we know for sure. He's a robot and his memory is false. This makes almost everything about the early part of the film wonderfully weird. It opens up the possibility that when Deckard is brought into the police station and speaks with Bryant (M. Emmet Walsh), that this is the first time these two men have ever spoken!""I need the old magic,"" Bryant tells him. But there is no old magic. Deckard's complicated, perhaps tragic, in any case mysterious, personal history doesn't exist. Bryant has been told to speak to Deckard as if they'd known each other for years. By who? By higher ups. By people at the Tyrell Corp. maybe. In any case, it's made perfectly clear that replicants equipped with memory implants are a new model. Very new, like not even on the market yet. I know a lot of fans buy into the ""Deckard is a replicant"" reading, while at the same time wanting to imagine him as a grizzled old veteran cop, with years of experience under his belt. But I don't think you can have it both ways. If he is a replicant, he is necessarily new. Just off the assembly line, like Rachel must be.Similarly, when we see Deckard going into his apartment, after his visit to the Tyrell Corporation, this is the first time he has ever entered this apartment. He only knows his way around it, and who the people in his photographs are, because of the memory implants.Obviously, if you prefer, you can imagine Deckard as a week old replicant, or a month old replicant, but I don't know why you would. There'd be no point in having an expensive replicant drifting through the city reading the want ads for a few weeks, looking for a job his manufacturers know he'll never take.No. It's much more fascinatingly twisted to watch this character do for the first time things he thinks he's been doing for years. He gives Rachel the VOIGHT-KAMPFF test. He's never given a Voight-Kampff test before. He makes a phone call. He has never made a phone call before. And, of course, he has never killed anyone.This way of interpreting Deckard's actions is provocative not necessarily because it's so radically different a take on reality from what we're used to, but because it's a play on a dynamic that's so absolutely common. The main character's backstory is fictional in every movie. It's the stuff all screenplays are made of. The first time we catch sight of a character in a movie is, effectively, the first time he or she has ever really existed. Backstory is a thing we the audience believe in to create for ourselves that sense of reality or continuity which narrative so depends on.For instance, when The Maltese Falcon opens Sam Spade and his partner Miles Archer are sitting around their office. They're partners. They've known and trusted each other for years. They're worked on numerous cases together.But, of course, they haven't really. They only act like they have. It's just a movie. They don't exist prior to the first scene in it. The concept of Deckard's memory implants merely makes this idea much more literal.And making abstract, theoretical ideas literal is something the best science fiction has always been good at. Serious SF has the ability to confront a concept that's fuzzy and hard to wrap your head around and recontextualize it, turning it into something immediate and tangible.One of the proto- Sci-Fi masterpieces, Stephenson's Doctor Jekyll and Mister Hyde, does this as well as anything. After all, duality within the human soul had been dealt with and analyzed from any number of viewpoints. What Stephenson did was make the abstraction of moral duality more easily viewable by making it a much more real, immediate situation in which his main character experiences the extremes of this duality in clearly distinguishable personalities struggling for control within himself.False personal backstory isn't the only abstraction BR makes literal.There's no difference between what the replicants want and what anybody else wants. The conflicts that the replicants are struggling with are the same existential issues everyone confronts: I'm going to die. I don't know when. I don't want to. What's so unusual? But the fact that their problems are so essentially run-of-the-mill doesn't make the film less interesting. It makes it more interesting, as it bundles this familiar angst in a shiny new package and, successfully, freshens it up, letting us experience it as something novel and provocative."
CinemaSerf,"Jun 8, 2023",7/10,"This time, it is Ridley Scott's turn to offer us his prognostication of a future wherein corporate America has, ostensibly benignly, introduced the ultimate in labour saving devices - androids called ""replicants"" - which have a look and feel of people about them. These ""Nexus"" creations can turn their hands to just about anything, but when the latest off-world models rebel, all of their cousins become outlawed and it falls to the ""Blade Runners"" to track them down and destroy them. ""Deckard"" (Harrison Ford) is one such operator who is called back out of his retirement to identify four of these highly adaptable and intelligent robots and this perilous task takes him to the heart of their manufacturer run by the fiendishly clever but unscrupulous ""Tyrell"" (Joe Turkel), and into a web of duplicity surrounding their controlling protocols and maybe even a fifth, almost impossible to recognise ""replicant"", whom - unlike it's contemporaries - has no idea that it isn't human. Ford is on cracking form here, as is Rutger Hauer - the android leader ""Batty"" and the dark, frequently rainy imagery contributes wonderfully to this seedily presented story of greed and manipulation set amongst a grittily dank and hostile environment that offers little, visually anyway, by way of hope or relief. It has a film-noir look and feel to it, and Scott keeps it moving well, keeps the dialogue sparse - though impactful, and the whole thing develops cinematographically some of the pretty profound questions brought up in the original Philip Dick novel about just what constitutes humanity. Just shy of two hours - it flies by, especially on a big screen where the visuals and audio still work wonders."
denis888,"May 14, 2014",1/10,"Awful - this is the only correct word that comes into mind while trying to express an impression after watching this horrible, endless, long, slow, trite, banal, bland, vapid, tasteless, languid, sorrowful and pitiful movie. Risdley Scott made this maybe as a film noir, instead he made a deep insult to all of us. Mindless bog, slow dark laughable waste of time and money, terribly poorly sync'd, with all plot holes, silly dialogs and unbearably poor acting of Hannah, Hauer, Harrison and all the rest. Ut seems they were all dead bored with this curio, and endless steamy dark scenes only build up a bigger misery that this film evokes. There are no redeeming features in this bog, no light in this drabness, no sense in this ugly mire. I was repeatedly told how cool Blade Runner was, now I say that the blade is blunt, and the only running must be away from this horrible dross. Must not be seen by anyone and ever."
carel-109-348387,"Oct 18, 2019",10/10,"First things first. Best SF movie ever. No doubt.What really amazes me is the top qualification of Harrison Ford in many reviews. And in also many reviews Hauer is not even mentioned.I saw this movie when it was released. The role of Hauer was deeply impressive. And Ford was dim, a bit of a non character.I still have this opinion, Harrison did much, much better in other films. But in this one there was only one leading player: Rutger Hauer."
WhiteFire404,"Oct 19, 2017",9/10,"This is a film that took me at least 3 viewings to fully appreciate (Like most people apparently), now is one of my favorite films of all time. Blade Runner is in every way, a flawed master pieces, a film that has problems that everyone overlooks because of how good the film itself is, the visuals are by far the stand out of the movie, they still look outstanding, so many years later, and the special effects have barely aged for the most part, the environments were definitely something unique for their time and you can see how they became an influence for so many films of the genre that came after it,the world feels alive, real and it's an amazing achievement, the directing by Ridley Scott is one of the best I have seen in his entire career and the musical score by Vangelis is fantastic and the script is excellent, the story while pretty straightforward, there are so many details that requires you to pay attention to fully understand what is happening or in some cases, what might be happening, Harrison Ford also delivers in my opinion one of the best performances of his career, through the entire film i didn't saw Ford, I saw Deckard. The film has flaws that lie mostly in some scenes that do drag a bit too much and some plot elements here and there that could either be shorten or skipped entirely, but like I said, those flaws are overcome by everything the film does right and that's why Blade Runner is to this day considered a master piece."
johnnymacbest,"Jan 31, 2008",10/10,"Blade Runner is a film that eschews cinematic brilliance. It's beautifully gritty, dark, and foreboding in every way in its context and content. It is a sci-fi film, but it is more than that; it is a mere reflection of our modern world where technology has seemingly dominated our lives almost in every aspect. It is also a world where the masses have become more or less human and tend to take for granted just what being human really is. One of the most influential films of all time is finally released as ""The Final Cut"" and its great to revisit a classic film that, like a bottle of wine, gets better with age."
claszdsburrogato,"Sep 26, 2023",10/10,"When it comes to the best science fiction films in cinema, Blade Runner is always remembered among them. When watching the film it becomes clear why there is such exaltation. The story is incredible and very well told, with a fantastic philosophy that accompanies the development of the characters. Ridley Scott's direction is masterful, he presents this dystopian future in an excellent way that makes the story easy to understand. In terms of visuals, this film doesn't lose anything, all the characters have a very striking and interesting design. This is certainly one of the most memorable science fiction films in cinema."
kekca,"Jan 17, 2014",6/10,"You are asking yourself why I write about this movie now. I am answering: I have not seen the movie before and I was mistaken it with another one. Also I know that it is well known.Probably it was hit on its time. I thought of it as a story of the future but told with the resources of the 80's. 1982 it was published for my surprise. I can now explain better Harisson Ford in it. Very good scene in front of his door in his apartment.Long, slow, caring away without little dialog. Little but essential. It look over the questions of extreme of human existence, emotions and moral. Of insufficiency of given time for existence. In the end I thought that is talking about war and training people and sending them to battle.It talks about 2019 but I hope that our problems will be then the same and even be gone. That people will be more sober and humble. This is all for the replicants and their creators.http://vihrenmitevmovies.blogspot.com/"
eman-3,"Aug 29, 1998",9/10,"Highly intelligent futuristic thriller that had the critics baffled on its initial release. The plot has your mind working overtime, (not like todays brainless studio movies), and the senses are dazzled by the spectacular photography, the stunning sets, the dreamlike effects and spellbinding music. It all comes together to make the greatest futuristic thriller."
Dello_,"Feb 12, 2020",7/10,"I'm going to say it immediately: I didn't particularly like the overall design of the futuristic Los Angeles. Ok, I've said it, I've said it. Now I'll articulate better what I think about this movie. As I said I wasn't fond of the design but not because it's ugly or what, it's just my personal taste. Indeed if we consider the time when it came out (1982), the work done is remarkable and the instances where you think: ""this has aged badly"" are like two or three and it's pretty impressive. But it wasn't for me. Even with the plot I had some problems but I liked a lot other things. The story is simple and linear and there wasn't an unexpected moment but it's instead prevedibile in a lot of ways. On the other hand I was on board because of the charismatic protagonist and the memorable villain, that steals the show every time he is on the screen. But most importantly what I liked more is the mysterious sense about some plot points. In fact, despite a linear story, there are some elements here and there that makes you wonder about the real nature of some characters and the film does not answer to these questions. And I personally like when a movie leaves you with some thinking about what's the right interpretation even if there's no a clear one.
And so overall I liked ""Blade Runner"" (the final cut) but, even if I recognised the enormous importance it has on the history of cinema, I don't think it's the masterpiece a lot of people claims this movie to be."
Nephelith,"Feb 14, 2021",4/10,"The aesthetics are mindblowing, even in 2021, but the plot is dull, weak and predictable.I had to skip over several scenes that were unnecessarily violent and some other things were absolutely unconvincing - such as always finding the one person you're looking for in the most overcrowded city of all times, or the love story that you can see coming from miles away. As much as I enjoy slow-paced and ambient films, Blade Runner's slowness is due to its ridiculous lack of plot development. The story is one big void.Good visuals sadly aren't a seal of a quality story."

hitchcockthelegend,"Mar 19, 2016",10/10,"Blade Runner is one of those glorious films that has gained in popularity the older it has gotten. Ridley Scott's follow up to the critical and commercial darling that was Alien, was by and large considered a flop and damned for not being a science fiction action blockbuster. There was of course some fans who recognised its many many strengths during the initial weeks of its 1982 release, but many who now claim to have loved it back then are surely looking sheepishly in the mirror these days, for the hard-core minority of 82 fans remember it very differently.Remember the spider that lived outside your window? Orange body, green legs. Watched her build a web all summer, then one day there's a big egg in it. The egg hatched...Anyway, that's by the by, the point being that a film can sometimes be ahead of its time, misunderstood or miss-marketed, Scott's masterpiece is one such case. Story, adapted in fashion from Philip K. Dick's story, Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep? Is pretty simple. It's a dystopian Los Angeles, 2019, and there are four genetically engineered Replicants - human in appearance - in the city, which is illegal. They were designed to work on off-world colonies, any Replicant who defies the rules will be retired by special police assassins known as Blade Runners, and Blade Runner Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is on this case. A case that will prove to have many layers...A new life awaits you in the Off-world colonies! A chance to begin again in a golden land of opportunity and adventure!Ridley Scott gets to have all his cakes to eat here, managing to blend intriguing science fiction with film noir. That the visuals are outstanding is a given, even the film's most hardest critics grudgingly acknowledge this to be an eye popping piece of visual class - the mention of eyes is on purpose since it's forms a key narrative thread. That it is awash with eye orgasms has led to critics calling a charge of beauty over substance, but the deep themes at work here tickle the brain and gnaw away at the senses.Quite an experience to live in fear, isn't it? That's what it is to be a slave.Mood is set at perpetually bleak, a classic film noir trait, and paced accordingly. Scott isn't here to perk anyone up, he's here to ask questions whilst filtering his main characters through a prism of techno decay, of humanity questioned to the max, for a film so stunning in visuals, it's surprisingly nightmarish at its core. The emotional spine is ever present, troubled when violence shows its hand, but it's there posing an intriguing question as the Replicants kill because they want to live. And this as our antagonist, Deckard (Ford a brilliantly miserable Marlowe clone), starts to fall for Rachael (a sensually effective femme fatale portrayal), one of his retirement targets.Tears in the Rain.As Rutger Hauer (never better) saunters more prominently into the story as head Replicant Roy Batty, the pic evolves still more. Haunting lyricism starts pulsing away in conjunction with Vangelis' rib shaking techno score, while Jordan Cronenweth's cinematography brings Scott's masterful visions to life, key characters one and all. Visuals, aural splendour and dark thematics - so just what does it mean to be human? - Indeed, curl as one in a magnificent cinematic achievement. A number of cuts of the film are out there, and all of them have fans, but Scott's Final Cut is the one where he had total artistic control, and the scrub up job across the board is quite literally breath taking. 10/10"
aquaalexhart,"Nov 19, 2015",10/10,"I have watched this movie so many times since it first came out and it is till one of the best sci-fi, specifically in the cyberpunk genre.To me this is still the best acting from Harrison Ford and Rutger Hauer , but we have so many good actors in this movie. Ridley Scott delivered an amazing movie a step up from Alien and nothing he has done since will ever be as great as this movie.A very dark movie, investigating our Humanity with lots of bread crumbs to lead us into many different interpretations of what actually was happening and how the characters are related.Do yourself a favour and watch this movie if you have not and watch it again if you have."
ddrddr,"Jan 16, 2019",10/10,"Perfect in every way!!!from the sound track, the acting the incredible cinematography
this is film 101It is hard to believe this is from the same Ridley Scott who brought us the awful Alien: Covenant
maybe creating perfection is more of a fluke than a norm but Riley has given us some of the best movies ever.if you get a chance please read or watch Ridley's interview regarding the making of Blade runner, you will find it very revealing, he was constantly being pushed and threatened by the mob who had financed the movie.the final scene with Rutger Hauer had to be shot in one take
The building they were filming in had to be returned to its normal state and they literally had no time left.They had used a stunt double to do the building leap but he could not manage it, the gap was too great for him, so Rutger Hauer in 1 take did the jump the dove scene and even improvised the ending....
Incredible!I think this movie is better than the book, how often can anyone say that?do you think Rick Deckard is a replicant?I could go on and on but i am sure others have covered all the nuances of this film far better than i ever couldI can watch this film over and over again and find something new in it every timea true masterpiece!"
invertedforest-70474,"Dec 20, 2015",N/A,"The view of the world in this film is cool for me, although now there are a lot of similar products in other films, books and comics. This film was released in 1982. So many those works would be influenced from this film. I can watch it smoothly because of it. However, that situation makes this film less surprising because of its huge influence. Although that I watched this film many years later from the release in 1982, I felt that most things in the story is still not out of the date. Not only view of the world, but the characters in this film are attractive for me. Especially Replicant is more attractive than others."
errant-52785,"Oct 11, 2020",7/10,"I've now watched the 3 main cuts of this over the course of decades. I just don't think I'm ever going to be a fan of it. The visuals are amazing (mostly), but the characters and plot, what little of either there are, just don't grab me."
jringel-03977,"Jun 3, 2016",10/10,"***Review contains no plot summary or spoilers*** ""Blade Runner"" is an oppressively dark and sad Sci-Fi noir dystopian film, but undeniably gorgeous and genius in its craft. An outstanding, wonderful classic that has endured time and criticism. Ridley Scott has never reached this pinnacle in his career since, which is so unfortunate. He has a remarkable filmmaking talent like the greats of Stanley Kubrick and Orson Welles. Upon first full viewing of the film, I was drawn in by the visual effects and the narrative. As the credits rolled, I thought with teary eyes how could humanity be so cruel. The film leaves ambiguous questions that may or may not have answers; allowing philosophical speculation. Many films today give you answers, even if the answers are stupid. There is a book called ""Eyes Wide Open"", and in the book the author asks Kubrick what he thought about Spielberg's ""Schindler's List"" and the Holocaust. Kubrick replied, ""Schindler's List was about success. The Holocaust was about failure."" ""Blade Runner"" does not romanticize the mainstream Hollywood formula of happy endings (or at least the Final/Directors Cut) and individuals, but instead focuses on major aspects of the society portrayed in the film. The acting in ""Blade Runner"" is superb, especially from the wonderful Rutger Hauer. Los Angeles is stunning thanks to visual effects designer Syd Mead and direction by Ridley Scott. Greatest use lighting ever used in film. A true landmark in the history of art. 10/10"
bigpappa1--2,"May 25, 2000",7/10,"Blade Runner has so many good things going for it, but the few flaws it has, brings it down. Featuring breathtaking set design and brillant special effects, plus it has a great cast and great direction. But the script is only so-so, and not fully developed, and the film is overlong. Still a very worth while film. Rating: 7 out of 10."
hanschsolo,"May 27, 2023",10/10,"An film that released in 1982, and still is, and always will be, relevant. Blade Runner is timeless, it can be almost counted as a warning for the technological opportunities of humanity. If we, as a species, create beings that should, work like us to serve the growth of industrial society, why are we angry when those beings start to think and act like us? Whose fault is it?Blade Runner deals with that question. And it deals with it masterfully. Every single one of those 4 Replicants wasn't necessarily a bad person. They're not typical antagonists. They are just people, who want to live more. And they have the right to be upset, why should the products we make be failures, If this would happen in real life, we would be the failures, because we lost all of our sense of moral and empathy and gave and took the life of a sort of new species.The arrogance of humanity has made Los Angeles how is it portrayed in this film to what it is, it's all about capitalism, and even if we aren't where Blade Runner thought we where in 2019, we get closer to that vision within every year that passes. I'll give the climate fifteen years until it reaches a point where rain is a daily-thing.It's interesting and kinda sad how a man can love a woman, that is not even a real human-being. Rachel has the shape and she physically feels like a woman, she conveys emotions out of her, but she simply isn't, everything she remembers is from a different real human being. I think the question if it is justified for a man like Deckard to Kiss and Love an replicant, really interesting.The only thing that mostly matters to human beings, is being real. Living in the real world or being a real person is important to us, that is what gives us faith in religion and spirituality, and if that Idea of realism gets torn apart, and everything you believed is real for your whole life is suddenly fake, just some wires, electricity and implants, you can't cope with that surrealism. Rachel embodies that surrealism, her reaction when Deckard tells her that he knows her memories more detailed than she knows, her whole view of life is uncertain. Sean Young portrays the emotions of Rachel even just with a subtly tear or look profoundly.But Rutger Hauer as Roy Batty.. he made himself immortal with this role. Forget about everything that I mentioned, even If the plot and Ideas of the film would be just half as good, that final monologue from Rutger Hauer changed my life. Even the worst replicant still has the ability to show empathy, and see life as a gift in his last moments, no matter how horrible or terrifying it was. It is special, how much life means to a single individual. After a moment passes it is just lost in time, forever.I love Blade Runner. I love the atmosphere, the Idea of a over-industrialized capitalistic world, Vangelis soundtrack, the consequences of empathetic replicants with feelings, but most importantly, that it teaches, that life is a gift."
btoews,"Jul 3, 2020",6/10,Blade Runner is one of those great films that does not hold up as time passes-a lot of it is the nature of the film-a forecast in 1981 of 2019 that is laughably off mark and distracting. The other thing is the story moves at a snails pace which doesn't work as well these days. Like I said it is a great movie but if you are a younger person watching this for the first time prepare to be disappointed for sure.
alpha-lima-easy-xray,"Jun 5, 2018",1/10,"I thought it'll be a movie after ""Do androids dream of electric sheep"" novel. Boy, was I wrong. This movie is after... nothing that makes any bit of sense.The film makers decided to thoroughly recreate some not-so-important scenes from the while entirely omitting all the context, all the plot, almost all the philosophy - all the substance of the book. And all the common sense.This is easily the most boring movie I've ever forced myself to sit through. And while whether you get bored or not is a matter of perception, it's a cold hard fact that the movie has no substance."
tjohnsn61,"Dec 12, 2010",10/10,"Excellent casting, memorable dialog, special effects are superior and far ahead of their time, combined with the shadowy sets in LA, excellent film work, directing and the music of Vangelis. This movie is priceless. I will no doubt continue to watch it over and over as I have every year since it came out. I never tire of it and the subtle truths it conveys about our humanity.The mix of beauty, pain, dirt and perfection - only longstanding classics contain the perfect balance of light and shadow. This movie achieves this balance to perfection. The musical score supports the fantastic acting, lighting, plot and costumes. Superb, absolutely superb."
lodidodi-89248,"Nov 7, 2019",10/10,This is the best movies ever made as far as Im concerned. In fact its so much better than any other movie I find almost incredible it exists. Movies aint supposed to be this great
vithiet,"Dec 30, 2018",10/10,"A sci-fi classic that set up the rules for cyberpunk genre in movies. Also in my top 10 of all time favorites. It has aged well, though some scenes do feel a bit dated (the slightly ""rape-y"" vibe during the love scene comes to mind). If you are in the US, be sure to watch the ""Director's Cut"" edition."
eyesour,"Dec 17, 2010",10/10,"Matchless. A magnificent meditation on the reality of death, and life's ultimate lack of meaning. One or two mentally challenged reviewers have complained that ""replicants"" could easily have been created a different colour, say, green; or been given six arms. Why were they made exactly the same as human beings? Answer: because they are exactly the same as human beings. In fact, all human beings are replicants of oneself. They are what one sees with one's own eyes, in the mirror, and all around one. If you follow the film closely. I think it was Ogden Nash who wrote: ""My fellow man I do not care for/ I often ask me what he's there for/ The only answer I can find/ Is reproduction of his kind."" Had he lived a little later, he might have written ""replication of his kind"".One of the brighter dumb-dumbs points out, in a puzzled way, that there are no children in this vale of tears. Well, there wouldn't be, since replicants are made instead. As well as toys for scientific Sebastian to play with. There's something of him in all of them. What exactly is Tyrell playing at? God knows. Why, exactly, were the pyramids ever built? What was the point of burying everything of material value inside them? I'll tell you about my wrapped-up mummy, you trick-cycling apparatchik. Take a trip to see her for yourself.Another thing. Without memories we have no identity at all. We only exist because we have learned to walk and talk, and remember how to do it. Who could we possibly be without our collection of mental photographs? Search me. Another thought: could there be a collective subconscious, and was Jung possibly right? Are unicorns part of everyone's folk-memory?Everything about Blade Runner is fabulous. It soars where the clunky and only semi-literate Kubrick stumbles and fumbles. Even greater than Marienbad, which sadly shot itself in the corporation; or anything by Bergman. The performances are nonpareil. The girl playing Rachael (funny spelling) is perfection itself. But all the players are flawless, anyway. The vision is transcendental. I guess you could say I admire it."
sameasnothing,"Dec 10, 2001",N/A,"The views in Blade Runner, from the beginning, are just amazing...that's all i know how to put it. It's not flashy and screaming for attention like today's science fiction movies.If futurism was art, Blade Runner's subtle futuristic details (including such things from architecture to the gleaming sky) would be more Ancient Egypt or Renaissance than 3-year-old with neon finger paint for recent Sci-Fi films. Not meant to be so scathing of today's films, but when I first saw Blade Runner I was awed. It was so stylish, so smooth, so elegant. Maybe I'm looking at it from an odd perspective, but I found the entire movie, Ridley Scott's amazing use of light (or should I say usually lack of), and all the carefully placed metaphors to just be incredible. Looking back at Star Wars, it definitely lacks (in all aspects) and just can't compare. If a movie was all looks and no content, it would be flat and not be able to support its own weight and it only crumble!! [or it would just get bad reviews =)] However, Ridley Scott drew on inspiration from 2 well-known books (the title book-""Blade Runner"", and ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?""). While relying more on the concepts of ""Do Androids"",  Ridley still changed the plot greatly while managing to come out with a big ""thinker"" movie. The producers attempted to change his final product but now (19 years later) usually you can get it in the True original form, the Director's cut. One of my favorite scenes, the unicorn scene where Deckard has a dream of a unicorn while playing the piano in a daze, is one of my favorite scenes and is cut out of the ""edited"" version. This scene could be interpreted as important to understanding stuff in the movie, but I'm gonna make you watch it to figure out why!Maybe the greatest thing about Blade Runner is the philosophy aspect of it. Without giving away crucial parts of the film, the best scenes were the ones involving the ""Replicants"" (androids) where one's mirroring emotions of sympathy and anger push back and forth at seeing these killing machines defend their humanity and right to live before their human counterparts. I also found the humans' seemingly lack of understanding of the very things they created intriguing as well. All these things the movie dealt with; but to understand better you must watch the movie.Blade Runner is an amazing movie, and I would say Harrison Ford's best science fiction movie ; ). If anyone has not seen this movie they need to get to a movie store and rent it now because it is one of the greatest movies ever. Philosophical, futuristic, stylish, just plain awesome: Blade Runner!"
view_and_review,"Mar 21, 2006",7/10,"Maybe I have too much reference material to allow me to enjoy this movie as everyone else has, being that I watched this in 2006 instead of 1982. Maybe in 1982 this movie would have been a lot better, but in 1982 I was too young to watch this movie let alone understand anything about it. The concept was a good one, that of life like robots, A.I., cyborgs, replicants, etc. but in this day an age that story has been told a million times in a million different ways (see A.I., Terminator 1-3, Matrix, Space Odessey 2010, I,Robot, etc.) Bladerunner was interesting and distinct from the standpoint that these robots only wanted to stay alive longer than the 4 years they were designed to. The movie as a whole was alright, I just couldn't get acclimated to the idea that these robots were too life-like. They not only displayed feelings, but they had feelings for each other, they feared death, they displayed panic, passion, and they sweat and cried. But what really took the cake was Deckard (Harrison Ford) sleeping with and ultimately falling in love with what he KNEW to be a robot, and likewise she fell in love with him. That was a bit much."
MovieAddict2016,"Dec 13, 2004",9/10,"When I first saw ""Blade Runner"" I was severely disappointed as I felt it had wasted a great deal of potential. I didn't like the acting much, I didn't like the music and the whole neo-futuristic-film-noir thing wasn't very impressive as it's been aped in films for the past two decades and some of them have done it a bit better.I felt the romance between Harrison Ford and Sean Young was entirely unbelievable and given very little time to develop - it's him suddenly wooing her and romancing her without much actual chemistry forming. Their romance is a vital part of the story but I felt it was given very little focus.However on second and third viewing I suddenly realized what a masterpiece ""Blade Runner"" is. I seemed to ""get"" it; perhaps I understood the point of the film's ending more. I originally loathed the wacky OTT climax, considering it stupid and unoriginal/unimaginative - but on second viewing I picked up on all the subtleties and was touched by Hauer's final speech, particularly the ""like tears in rain"" moment.Overall this really is a fantastic sci-fi film noir story - it successfully mixes various genres. Its effects are a bit outdated now and if you sit down to watch it expecting too much you're likely to be disappointed - it has its fair share of flaws (from technical to story-wise) but if you can overlook some of these it really is a great deal of fun, even if it's not ""the"" best science fiction film (as some people have claimed)."
SquigglyCrunch,"Mar 22, 2017",7/10,"Blade Runner is set in a futuristic world where robots have advanced to the point of being almost identical to humans. When they decided to act against humans, people called blade runners were hired to hunt down and destroy them. Rick Deckard, a former blade runner, is called back into action to take down a few robots before they can kill anyone else.The movie manages to pull off some fantastic practical effects. Everything looks real and unique, reason being it is. And it's awesome. I've always loved practical effects more than CGI, and here is no exception.The set designs are fantastic too. The world the movie builds looks great and feels authentic to an extent. It's immersive and interesting, and it's one I can't wait to continue to explore in Blade Runner 2049.Other than those technicalities, this movie sucks. For starters, the writing is terrible. The dialogue is generic and uninteresting, and the characters are the same. The first hour of the movie is consumed by literally nothing. I don't remember a single thing that happened. Deckard wasn't even looking for the robots, he was just kind of wandering around while the robots did the same. Then the last hour is just a rushed, forced, jumbled mess where so little intrigues that it almost gets boring. And to top it off, two characters end up in a relationship that is built around intimidation and two meet- ups, whereupon by the end we as the audience are expected to believe that they are in love. It just doesn't make sense.The climax is particularly bad. It seems to resemble Japanese anime in how completely weird and nonsensical it is. We've all seen it, live action anime doesn't work. 9/10 times anyway, and here isn't an exception. And even when it reaches it's end, there's no tension, no excitement, nothing. In fact, the movie becomes incredibly boring, and every second couldn't be longer.As a whole the movie is just super generic. The way in which Deckard ends up in this job is generic, the romantic aspect is generic. There's nothing new here.Overall Blade Runner is a huge disappointment. Sure, it looked pretty, but the first hour is literally nothing, the writing is uninteresting and the movie as a whole proves to be the same. I'm pretty sure there was even a plot hole in there, but maybe that was lost in the lack of anything in the first half. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie."
stevemetallicafan458,"Jun 25, 2018",6/10,I'm a big Sci-fi fan but this film tried to do too much psychologically. Overrated and doesn't deserve the general rating. Worth a watch to pass judgement yourself
rwingace,"Jun 5, 2010",1/10,"This is one of the worst movies ever made. I can't believe this movie has a ""cult"" following.I like just about any movie, I even get enjoyment from the straight to DVD American Pie movies and other B or C rated movies. However, this movie is just awful to watch.I stopped watching it 3 times and kept forcing myself to go back and try to finish thinking it will eventually get better. And while watching it I had my DVD player on 2x speed because its so boring and slow.Avoid this movie unless you want to fall asleep."
