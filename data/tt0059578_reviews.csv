SnoopyStyle,"Sep 21, 2013",9/10,"Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Clint Eastwood) are both bounty hunters. They're both after the bank robber El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) for his bounty. They decide to join forces to bring El Indio and his gang of robbers down.Lee Van Cleef makes this a superior spaghetti western. He's not only as good as Clint. In many ways, he plays a superior character. His character has secrets. He has mysteries. Clint is playing a much more simpler character. For me, this is superior to 'A Fistful of Dollars' in the trilogy. The story is more iconic, cleaner. The characters have more depth."
iamyuno2,"Mar 7, 2014",9/10,"Exceptional performances by three heavyweight actors, Gian Maria Volonte and Lee Van Cleef - both of whom, it's a shame, did not have all that many more opportunities to shine in quality films after this one - and Clint Eastwood, along with taut direction, editing, cinematography and gripping and unique music (by the great Ennio Morricone), make this movie a real standout. (The music's almost a major character in this film, in fact.) Stylistically iconic, this Sergio Leone opus has an endlessly fascinating and spellbinding story that surprises to the end. Plus, we really come to like the co-heroes, Van Cleef and Eastwood - we want to befriend them and emulate them. Volonte was priceless as a demonic villain - his facial expressions rich with narcissism and a strange kind of violence-fueled euphoria no one else has ever matched in film history, for my money. Though he clashed with director Leone and purportedly did not like the Western genre, Volonte's performance rises above the film's genre and could be favorably compared to the best portrayed villains of other more mainstream movies. Volonte brought a realism to his character and an intensity you don't see in many films. But so did Van Cleef, whose work in this film is incredible. You'd have thought other movie makers would have rushed to cast Van Cleef in important roles after this film, but no. Very strange. Though some might question the wanton violence in this film, the truth is that the real wild west was even more violent and the violence often much more capricious and random. Like all great artistic works, this film never grows old for me. I am always drawn to watch it again and again for it is of such a depth and complexity that it only reveals more of itself with each viewing."
jluis1984,"Jul 4, 2006",9/10,"Italian director Sergio Leone changed the face of the Western genre in 1964 when he introduced what would be known as the ""Spaghetti Western"" with the brilliant ""Per un Pugno di Dollari"" (""A Fistful of Dollars""). Not only the films looked grittier, violent and realistic; the characters in Leone's westerns became complex men with complex and obscure moral codes, very far away from the classic clear moral opposites of previous westerns. ""Per Qualche Dollaro in più"" (""For a few dollars more""), is the epitome of all this. It is a powerful, raw and ruthless masterpiece that transcended its genre and became one of the best movies of all-time.""For a Few Dollars More"", the second in the so-called ""Dollars trilogy"" (a group of films by Leone with the same style), is the story of two different yet very similar men, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and the Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) are two bounty hunters who are after the criminal named ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volontè). An unlikely alliance occurs between the two lone wolves as they decide to cooperate and divide the reward, but are these two killers after ""Indio"" for the same reason?Written by Fulvio Morsella and Sergio Leone himself, the film's main characteristic is the complex moral code the main characters follow. They are no longer the perfect clean heroes of classic westerns, both Manco and the Colonel have well-developed attitudes, motivations and purposes; they are neither completely good nor completely bad, they are just real. The story unfolds with a fine pace and good rhythm, it is probably the best structured of the ""Trilogy"" and the easiest to follow. It is also the one that represents the elements of the Spaghetti Western style the best.Stylistically, the film follows closely the conventions established by Leone's previous film but it takes them to the next level. The excellent use of minimalistic cinematography and the superb musical score by Ennio Morricone complement Leone's realistic vision of Westerns and completely redefined the genre's conventions. ""For a Few Dollars More"" is a violent tale of two hunters, and visually the film transmits the same emotions the characters feel. No more myths, the Westerns never felt this real.Clint Eastwood's super performance as Manco is very important for the success of the film, as he is the one that takes the audience through this brave new world, however, the star of the film is Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer. In one of his best performances ever, Van Cleef manages to be both menacing and interesting, giving life to Leone's brilliant script with great talent. Gian Maria Volontè as Indio complements the two big talents as the crazed criminal with a dark past, he is the perfect counterpart of the two lone wolves.""Per qualche dollaro in più"" is a near flawless movie, as every piece of the puzzle falls into the right place to create a marvelous and unforgettable picture. It's only minor problem may be the dubbing, but fortunately, it still is superior to the one heard in other Italian productions of the same time and it doesn't hurt the film.Fans will always argue about which of the three films of the ""trilogy"" is the best, and while personally I prefer ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" over this one, it is just a matter of personal taste as this film is as perfect as that one. A real classic that changed the face of Western as we knew it. 10/10"
TheLittleSongbird,"Aug 30, 2012",10/10,"Just for the record I happen to love all three films. For a Few Dollard More is an amazing film though perhaps not as influential as The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. There is one improvement over that film though, and that is the writing of Clint Eastwood's character, more developed and more compelling. A Fistful of Dollars is also great because of everything that makes TGTBATU and FAFDM so good, but I do consider the other two more influential on the genre and also Akira Kurosawa's Yojimbo, which used the film as its inspiration, to be the superior film. Back to A Few Dollars More, the stylised visuals are stunning to look at, the scenery is the very definition of epic and the cinematography sweeps. Ennio Morricone's score is both elegiac and operatic in tone and the story of greed and revenge that focuses mainly on the pursuit of bandit Indio draws you right in and never lets go. The dialogue is peppered with grit and dark humour, which is well-balanced with neither over-powering the other, while Leone's direction is superb. Clint Eastwood plays his more developed character with immense charisma, Lee Van Cleef is suitably vengeful and again Gian Maria Volonte snarls convincingly. Overall, a wonderful film. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
CinemaClown,"Mar 28, 2014",N/A,"Completely defying the tried & tested Hollywood formula and introducing his own style of narration that was more character driven, glamorized violence & also added a new dimension of moral ambiguity into its characters' psyche, thus bringing both heroes & villains very much on the same level, Sergio Leone presented a whole new outlook of the Wild West in A Fistful of Dollars but with this second chapter, he further accelerates the inevitable rebirth of the western genre.The second installment of Leone's Dollars trilogy is quite an improvement over its predecessor in almost all departments of filmmaking & gradually portrays the developing maturity in Leone's craftsmanship. Starring Clint Eastwood as a bounty hunter looking for a number of wanted suspects, who later partners with another bounty hunter looking for the same guys & make a deal of splitting the reward but in the end when it comes down to final showdown, one of them shows their real motive behind the hunt.Featuring an improved direction from Sergio Leone, For A Few Dollars More presents the director in more control of his artistry & has a much stronger script to muster ahead with. The scope of camera-work, the precision of editing & overall production design also get their upgrades plus the performances from the recurring cast turn out to be better than the previous film with Clint Eastwood & new addition of Lee Van Cleef impressing the most.On an overall scale, For A Few Dollars More is another huge step towards placing the coffin on traditional westerns & presents a significant evolution of every single aspect of its making when compared with A Fistful of Dollars. Ennio Morricone's music also leaves a bigger mark than before & it's exciting to observe how seamlessly it accompanies the drama. A rare sequel that improves upon the original, For A Few Dollars More is absolutely recommended."
Quinoa1984,"Dec 23, 2003",10/10,"As the second of the three films legendary filmmaker Sergio Leone collaborated on with Clint Eastwood (not to mention his first with Lee Van Cleef and his second with 'Fistful' actor Gian Maria Volonte), For a Few Dollars More gets well earned respect from the fans of the director and the groundbreaking star. And yet, occasionally there are those who'll not even know this film from Leone and Clint exists since it does sometimes get under the shadow of their two most infamous works, Fistful of Dollars (which for the most part introduced Clint and Leone to the public's awareness) and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (which solidified Clint as a Western icon and gave Leone a similar status for film buffs). But taken as a film unto itself, aside from its place in the trilogy, this is a Western that simply delivers the goods, and it does so with a spectacular marriage of style and substance.The story begins by introducing our two (anti) heroes, bounty hunters Douglas Mortimer (Cleef), former Colonel, and Monco (Eastwood), a drifter. They both set their sights on the leader of a gang of bandits named Indio (Volonte), who is plotting to go after over a million locked in a bank in El Paso. At first, Monco and Mortimer seem like their after Indio for the same reason- reward money- though there seems to be more than each man counted on with him and his gang.From the opening scenes with Cleef and Eastwood, to the scenes in El Paso, and then into the set pieces in the stone ruins in the Mexico desert(s), For a Few Dollars More displays the utmost skill by Leone in his storytelling, as well as in his use of the camera. Using Fistful's camera-man Massimo Dallamano, Leone does what he does best in his spaghetti westerns- he creates a perfectly in sync mood with his characters: each look in a scene, whether it's intense waiting for guns to be drawn, or just regular conversation, the look of the film draws the viewer in without over-doing it. Some points are made bold or repetitious (like Ennio Morricone's score, that keeps its whistling theme and serene watch theme completely in check), though it's not done to any degree of annoyance or by accident.In fact, that's what makes his westerns such fun, is that you take them seriously as films, yet he always reminds you that it's all in the 'movie-world' just by the way Mortimer or Monco strikes up a match. As for the actors themselves, Eastwood and Cleef are total pros in this genre, so ever line of dialog comes out naturally, and the supporting actors (however dubbed over from original Italian) all contribute great notes as well. At the least, it can appeal to a new generation of kids looking back to older movies, which may look at this and consider it more modernly crafted than a John Ford oldie. A+"
axopnk,"Aug 3, 2005",9/10,"This movie is the second best western i have ever seen with The Good, The Bad, The Ugly being first. I disagree with someone who wrote that this movie is not as good as A Fistful of Dollars. This movie is way better than a fistful of dollars. The reason is (as i pointed out in my other post) is that Clint's role or character is better when he has a good supporting member because it gives Clint's character more depth as well as throw a wild card into the mix. Lee van clef is excellent in his role, i still have him labeled as the bad but it was surprising to see him play a good guy in this one. Both bounty hunters have their own styles which meshes really good on the screen. Gian had more depth to this one which played perfectly into Lee Van Clefs character. In a fistful of dollars Gian didn't have much depth at all and some of the characters were annoying. I like how leone tied all of the characters into each other in this one, having all of their stories somehow play a role in the other ones. If you haven't seen this movie i suggest you watch Leone's films in chronological order with A fistful of dollars first, this one second, and finish it off with the good the bad the ugly. You'll be glad you did."
funkyfry,"Oct 10, 2002",9/10,"Excellent fun with sadistic humor from Leone.  Eastwood's best performance in a Leone film.  Van Cleef is good in a role similar to Chuck Bronson's in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"".  He is menacing and sympathetic, whereas in ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" he is just campy and all ""bad guy"" (but still fun).  What makes both performances so memorable I think is that Van Cleef seems to be in touch with Leone's dark humor, where Eastwood is used as a straight man.  Volonte is also excellent in the bandito role Leone used (an example of a standard European character type who reminds the audience of earthiness and the basic ignorance and greed of man).  A much better film than most people who've seen it on a Saturday afternoon on TV probably realize -- you have to see these movies in the theater to get the full hit."
Samoan Bob,"Mar 10, 2002",10/10,"""For a Few Dollars More"" has become the template for which most Spaghetti Westerns derive.As Leone went along, his films got more daring and complex, exploring new ideas and raising not only the bar for Spaghetti Westerns (which, contrary to popular belief, were around before ""A Fistful of Dollars"") but for Westerns in general. However, this exploration at times affected the quality of his films. Leone was a popcorn director - a visual stylist who always entertained first and maybe provoked a thought or two second. However, his films were never think pieces so when he tried to integrate depth into his films the results became uneven.""For a Few Dollars More"" is his best film because it catches Leone in his most transitional period. At once the film is more complex and stylized than ""A Fistful..."" and more tight and efficient than ""The Good, the Bad and The Ugly"" (which is almost on par with ""For a Few...""). The revenge sub-plot involving Colonel Mortimer is more compelling than the similar one in Leone's ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" because Mortimer is more developed as a character than the Harmonica Player (which is not to insult the great Charles Bronson).And hell, it has Lee Van Cleef as one of the biggest bad-asses of all time. The mere presence of Colonel Douglas Mortimer elevates the film to a new level. He steals the film from ""Manco"" completely. And Van Cleef's theft of the film is what makes it a cut above ""A Fistful..."". As a character, ""The Man With No Name"" (who in actuality has three: Joe, Manco and Blondie) isn't very interesting and there always needs to be a counterpoint to play off of him. That's why ""A Fistful..."" isn't nearly as good as this film or ""The Good..."" (which had the great Eli Wallach in one of the best scenery munching performances ever).So in closing, ""For a Few..."" is a tight masterpiece of fluff Western entertainment. It's mean, violent and immoral, just the way any good Spaghetti Western should be."
donuthaters12,"Oct 1, 2013",7/10,"Sergio Leone's sophomore film in his Spaghetti Western trilogy and is a major step up from A Fistful of Dollars. This was a film that didn't appeal to me, the first time I have watched it but as I watch it more and more along with others within the trilogy, I start to see the great things about this film. For A Few Dollars More is much more bigger and a much more better written film than it's predecessor.For A Few Dollars More was written by both Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni. Both have written a story that is engaging and this is due to a plot with much bigger stakes, and rewards, and also much better written characters. This film fleshes out the characters much more than it's predecessors, taking it's time to show each person's agenda and their personalities, yet Leone and Vincenzoni still has kept the unpredictability that was found in the first film. Oddly enough, even though Eastwood's character is the main star, the film's emotional significance was much more apparent on Mortimer and El Indio. Their back story is the reason that I care about these characters, it tells us why they are who they are. For A Few Dollars More's script has it's humor pumped up in comparison to the first film and I felt that this work. It actually gives the film much more character and helps not make the tone of the film too negative.Sergio Leone has created a film that is much more cinematic and traditional in comparison to the first film but at the same time not trading off the uniqueness of the first film, which was the slow building tension and the close ups of people's faces focusing on their reactions and the emotional facial acting by the actors. This film does increase the beat of the film, with editing that moves the film along at a pace that keeps us on our toes. Leone has definitely have gained much more confidence going towards this film as the film doesn't feel as indulgent as the first and seemed to show much more enjoyment with the story than the first film. This film's budget was much higher than the first film which allowed him to create settings that feel real and lively.Massimo Dallamano is back as the cinematographer of this film. The film looks much better than the first film and this may be due to the increase in budget and shot at better locations or it could be due to Dallamano and Leone has a much better understanding of what they want for this film. The film still retains that style from the first film with close ups that take it's time to move things along but it's much more improved here as they have used different angles and techniques in constructing these shots, allowing them to feel fresh. Dallamano has the camera move in this film much more than the first. The first film has it's shots set up in a way that doesn't require the camera to move or zoom into anything. This movement makes the film move faster and exciting.Ennio Morricone comes back to do the score for this film and it's just as great as the first one. The score here sounds much more fuller and dramatic, this may be due to a much larger story and much more characters focused on. Morricone's score here may not be as memorable as the first or third film but it definitely fits with what is shown on screen and it doesn't feel recycled. The film's score feels fast and upbeat, which sound great in moments of the film that have characters riding their horses on the beautiful backdrops. Morricone also has a much lighter and smaller track that plays during the build up of climax, the music that comes from the lockets. It sounds beautiful and it connects with the emotional weight during these situations.The film's cast is much bigger in this film and the film is now shared with three characters rather than a main focus on Eastwood. Clint Eastwood is great here as expected but not as memorable as A Fistful of Dollars. Lee Van Cleef brings something different to the film which gives the film much more personality. Leone loves to have actors banter in his films and it's definitely apparent here with the focus on the friendship on both Eastwood and Cleef's characters. Both actors work well together and it's a shame that this isn't the case for the next film. Gian Maria Volonte is back for this film as the antagonist, this time his character is much better written and his acting is much more effective but it may not appeal to everyone as he has increased the dramatics in this film in comparison to the first film.For A Few Dollars More is a much better constructed film than A Fistful of Dollars with a bigger and better story and improvements on the acting and photography. The film is great to watch on its own and does not require to watch the first or third film to understand but if you have seen the other films you get to pick up on the small things that Leone has put in this film."
hall895,"Feb 20, 2015",5/10,"The Man with No Name is back and this time he's got company. On the trail of the diabolical El Indio, a most wanted fugitive, our hero crosses paths with Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Mortimer is also after El Indio. After some manly posturing in which The Man with No Name and Mortimer shoot each other's hats the two decide to team up to go after El Indio and his gang. El Indio is currently targeting the Bank of El Paso, supposedly an impenetrable institution in which there is a safe containing almost a million dollars. The pair of bounty hunters plan to infiltrate the gang before the robbery and, if all goes according to plan, take down El Indio with ease. Of course, when does anything ever go according to plan? There will inevitably be complications. And when there are complications in a Western that can only mean one thing. Shootouts. Lots and lots of shootouts.The movie has a simple but reasonably engaging story with a few interesting characters. But the movie really fails to spark to life. The pacing is laborious, there are way too many times in this movie where absolutely nothing of any importance is happening. And even the shootouts, where you would expect the movie to shine, get dragged out to the point interest starts to wane. Once again Clint Eastwood does a fine job playing the ever-stoic Man with No Name. Lee Van Cleef brings a little much-needed personality to the role of Mortimer. And Gian Maria Volonté certainly makes for a convincingly detestable villain as El Indio. But despite the credible performances of the three main players the movie still disappoints. The rest of the cast makes very little impact, El Indio's mostly faceless gang making little impression. There's not enough going on with the story to really grab you. A couple of bounty hunters go after a bad guy. Some people shoot at each other now and again. That's about it. The movie ultimately tries to introduce some different motivation for why some of the characters do the things they do. But by then it's too late, you're really just waiting for the movie to end by that point. With some tighter pacing, some sharper action, this could have been a movie which really worked. As it is it's a bit of a letdown. Certainly not The Man with No Name's greatest adventure."
Infofreak,"Jul 4, 2003",N/A,"Leone's 'A Fistful Of Dollars' is a bona fide western classic, but amazingly he managed to top himself with this ""sequel"". Yeah, I know it isn't REALLY a sequel. In fact Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy actually have no connection with each other, and Eastwood's so-called ""Man With No Name"" actually has many! (In this movie Monco, in the previous one Joe). Most people seem go for 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' as the best of the three movies, but I think 'For A Few Dollars More' just beats it. Anyway, there's no argument that they are three brilliant films, Eastwood is super cool in all of them, Leone is on top form, particularly in this one, and Ennio Morricone's scores are amazing stuff. 'For A Few Dollars More' is helped enormously by Lee Van Cleef playing Colonel Mortimer, and the scenes between him and Eastwood, and the ones between him and Klaus Kinski are pure gold. This is not only one of the best westerns ever made, but one of the best movies of any genre released in the 1960s. It was also a highly influential one. I can't imagine Peckinpah's 'The Wild Bunch' for example existing without Leone. Words fail me praising movies as brilliant as this one. All I can say is WATCH IT NOW. Or if you've already seen it WATCH IT AGAIN!"
Pavel-8,"Oct 15, 2003",8/10,"""For a Few Dollars More"" is the middle film of Sergio Leone's classic western trilogy starring a then upstart Clint Eastwood. Sandwiched between ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and the finale, ""The Good, the Bad, & the Ugly."" This film provides further insight into Eastwood's ""Man with No Name.""Eastwood is a bounty killer who is in search of the feared bandit known as El Indio. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (played by Lee Van Cleef) is in a similar position, and the two cross paths many times in their pursuits of El Indio. The premise has similarities to that of the first, and in fact won't be all that surprising to most younger viewers. But at the time, the various plot turns and twists were unique and revolutionary.The pace is both a pro and con at the same time. Unlike modern films, the usual western showdown scenes unfold very deliberately. Rather than simultaneously begin and end in a furious volley of bullets, the encounters are set up slowly. On the bright side, this gives both the characters and the viewers an opportunity to fully appreciate the choices made and the consequences that will follow. From a negative perspective (not mine), one might say that the gunfights are plain slow, and the action is too sparse. While I enjoyed the change of pace, I also understand why some will say otherwise. Others portions of ""More"" can hang with any western sequences ever put on film. Highlighting the action is a robbery scene, the creativity of which ranks with any modern heist out of ""The Score"" or ""The Italian Job.""This trilogy catapulted Clint Eastwood to Hollywood fame, and one can see his star-making charisma ooze through the screen. Blending stoicism and machismo wonderfully, Eastwood produces the epitome of the tough and arrogant loner cowboy. In a role that could easily have been overshadowed, Van Cleef holds his own against Eastwood. His character was probably similar to Eastwood's in his youth, but Van Cleef accurately reflects the wisdom that would likely come with his character's age. The motley crew of baddies is filled with men who completely look their parts. That's about all that is asked of them, and they deliver.The cinematography of ""More"" follows in the groundbreaking footsteps of ""Fistful."" While one might not notice anything revolutionary now, at the time shots like that had scarcely been seen. Shots like the low-angles utilized prior to a few shootouts, as well as the framing of space are all now staples of cinematic westerns, and they originated here.Ennio Morricone's score is also a classic. Whether serving as epic background music for sweeping crane shots or providing aural cues during action sequences, the music is always appropriate and often the best part of the film.Bottom Line: While it might not seem as great now, so much of this movie was groundbreaking and remains classic that it merits 8 of 10."
Prismark10,"Jun 2, 2019",10/10,"Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood reunite for their second part of the Dollar trilogy.The man with no name is actually called Monco, a bounty hunter.

Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef.) Monco in the inside with the bandits and the Colonel on the outside. Things do not go initially to plan and the Colonel has another more personal reason to go after Indio.Sergio Leone delivers a cunning, violent, tricky, hypnotic classic spaghetti western.

The old man Monco meets who hates trains. The nervy performance from Klaus Kinski. Indio laughing like a maniac just like his 'Wanted' poster. Then there is the music by Ennio Morricone which is wonderfully evocative.The teaming of Van Cleef and Eastwood is just magical. Eastwood delivers another performance that would be another step into his legendary status.This is a better film than A Fistful of Dollars with a more tighter plot and shorter running time than the third movie, The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.I used to watch this film every year as a kid. The BBC would regularly show the trilogy. I viewed it again after so many decades and it has none lost of its magnificence."
Kamandi73,"Apr 20, 2020",10/10,"To those who were old enough to remember all the B Westerns that always followed the same formula, the Sergio Leone / Clint Eastwood Westerns wrecked everything before it.While there have been hundreds of great Westerns, like The Searchers, there was never anything like Clint Eastwood & Sergio Leone. They made three amazing movies, and For A Few Dollars More is one of the best. I like this one and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly equally, but TGTBTU would be a lot tighter and faster if some of the Civil War stuff in the middle had been cut out. For A Few Dollars More is all fast-paced action without the boring moralizing.Lee Van Cleef and Clint Eastwood work great together. It is a shame that they did not do anymore movies together besides the two with Sergio Leone. Gian Maria Volante is an incredible villain. He is very evil, and also very complicated. He is not just a thug. His gang of killers has to be in the top ten of any Western movie ever made. Every thug had some kind of individual trait. They were all memorable, and they were all cruel and evil characters.For a Few Dollars More is one of the ten best Western movies ever made."

BA_Harrison,"May 28, 2017",7/10,"For his follow up to spaghetti western classic A Fistful of Dollars, director Sergio Leone serves up more of the same, with lots of squinty eyed heroics, cigar chomping and twitchy trigger fingers. This time around, Clint Eastwood's impossibly cool 'man with no name' teams up with fellow bounty killer Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) to claim the money on the head of despicable outlaw El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè) and his gang (whose number include Klaus Kinski as an ornery hunchback), who are planning to rob the bank of El Paso.With every frame carefully considered, For A Few Dollars More is visually stylish throughout, and boasts an impressive score by the ever reliable Ennio Morricone, making the film a treat for both eyes and ears. The pacing, however, lets the movie down somewhat: at well over two hours, the rather slight story tends to drag at times—not quite as much as Leone's next two over-rated movies perhaps, but enough for my mind to start wandering at times.6.5/10, rounded up to 7 for IMDb."
MovieAddict2016,"Jul 10, 2004",8/10,"""For a Few Dollars More,"" the middle installment of the iconic Sergio Leone/Clint Eastwood ""Dollars"" trilogy, is the most brutal of all three films. Throughout the movie, ruthless bounty hunters, all of who seem to have no respect for human life, often perform cold-blooded murders. The bounty hunters use the ""wild west"" as a free range: they track, they kill, and they collect.One of these bounty hunters happens to be The Man with No Name (Eastwood), who returns to us now after his introduction in ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" which was the first movie of the trilogy. (An interesting observation is that the ""man with no name"" actually does have a name in each installment -- here, his name is Manco, but this is a fact that is often forgotten.)The Man with No Name/Manco is on a mission to find the criminal Indio (Gian Maria Volonté), whose capture is worth a large sum of money. It is quickly set up that local law enforcement is weak. Sheriffs are cowards. Only the vicious bounty hunters know how to drag in the criminals: dead or alive. Along for the journey is a fellow bounty hunter named Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), whose own reasons for seeking the man differ from Manco's. At first, the two killers go their own separate ways, and then decide to team up together and improve their chances of finding Indio -- despite the fact that their intentions for his capture are different.Not only are the two men's intentions different, but also their methods. Mortimer is a ruthless, cold-blooded murderer whose self-confidence is revealed through his barbaric actions. Manco, the hero, is less of a murderer and more of a law enforcer. Leone quickly sets this up through a sequence of shots: Mortimer's introduction, for example, begins with his search for a criminal, which finally comes to a finish as Mortimer confronts the man (who is hiding in a brothel). His foe manages to escape through a window, leaping onto a horse and galloping away through town. The images that follow reveal an insight into Mortimer's own self-confidence and startlingly calm nature.Manco's appearance is even more dramatic. He tracks down his own victim, and corners him in a saloon, only to see three cowboys appear out of nowhere and block off all exits. In one quick motion he swings around and fires three successive shots, each bullet finding its target.Here it is established that Manco is an underdog; therefore, our story's hero. He isn't as ruthless as Mortimer (who mercilessly picks his prey off from a distance) and his actions are somewhat admirable. The cowboys who tried to kill him were the bad guys. Manco was the good guy.Its lesser admirers often describe the film as being ""too long"". It's true that the film contains some unnecessary scenes, and these are often dragged out for dramatic effect -- but that is the point. The movie, directed by one of cinema's most ambitious and visionary directors (Sergio Leone, 1929 - 1989), is all about long passages of close-ups and wide-lense shots. Along with its predecessor and particularly its sequel, the ""Dollars"" trilogy revolutionized the derogatory ""spaghetti western"" description. In the years to come, Hollywood would actually aim to create films similar to the ""Dollars"" movies -- all of which were inferior. The entire ""Dollars"" trilogy has such scope, and ambition, that its Hollywood counterparts pale in comparison.Leone's direction is magnificent and would later inspire -- of all people -- Quentin Tarantino (whose ""Kill Bill"" movies owe something to the ""Dollars"" trilogy). Long, wide lenses and extreme close-ups only accentuate the fear of the men. There is a particular sequence of shots that clips back and forth between Mortimer and a wanted notice pinned to the exterior of a building. Leone slowly builds up the back-and-forth shots until they burst into a pattern of super-speed images, distinctly closed with the sound of gunshots. It's this sort of blazing, distinct style that makes the film so infectious and enjoyable.The acting cannot be criticized, although the English dubbing is sometimes rather laughable. Eastwood is one of the only actors whose voice is not dubbed -- but he rarely speaks. His face does all the talking. Lee Van Cleef (who was re-cast by Leone as a separate character in ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"") manages to turn Mortimer into one of the quintessential bad guys of cinema. Although the dubbing can occasionally detract from the flow of scenes and dialogue, the two lead performances by Eastwood and Van Cleef more than compensate for this slight flaw.Hollywood was cautious about releasing ""Dollars."" Eastwood, known for his role in the television series ""Rawhide,"" was the only marketable star. The director was an unknown Italian with no commercial successes. As its predecessor before it, ""For a Few Dollars More"" was delayed release in the States, where it was deemed ""unworthy.""However, the movie was a huge success in Italy, in particular; Clint Eastwood quickly gained a cult fan base overseas, but it was not until May 1967 -- after the US release of ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" -- that ""For a Few Dollars More"" and its predecessor would open to critical accolade and deserved celebration in the United States. Now, almost forty years later, it's still a fascinating piece of classic cinema."
Doylenf,"Aug 27, 2006",7/10,"This is another iconic spaghetti western so popular in the mid-'60s due to Sergio Leone's direction of CLINT EASTWOOD and LEE VAN CLEEF, two mesmerizing actors in another western scored by the talented Ennio Morricone.This time the two men are bounty hunters, presumably hunting guilty men for the same reason--except that one of them has a special mission. Without giving any plot points away, let's just say that the pocket watch bit is a clever ploy in leading to one of the more important gunfights.All the usual ingredients to make this an Eastwood hit are present, but this time it's LEE VAN CLEEF who makes the strongest impression in a role that is laced with some biting humor and sarcasm, tough but clever and clearly the more interesting of the two. Nevertheless, Eastwood is in fine form and the two men make the best buddy team since ""Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid"".The Morricone score will stick in your mind--and so will the overall impression the film makes as a tough spaghetti western."
Loo-2,"Mar 21, 2003",N/A,"For a few dollars more is Sergio Leone's 2nd installment in his classic Man with no Name trilogy.  This is the expanded version of the story of the American Wild West as seen in the context of Far eastern realism and morality.   It started with Leon's low budget remake of Karosawa's Yojimbo. In that film the man with no name (even though he has a name in each film, we are meant to feel that the name is not true, but something given to him by others).   His true name in each film are unknown, hence the man with no name.  Here to one post office clerk, he calls himself Manko, so in one scene only that name is referred, but is is soon forgotten and never used again.A fistful of dollars introduced us to this quick drawing silent gunslinger who sells himself to the highest bidder.Here our man enters his chosen trade.  That of a bounty hunter.  In the final chapter of the trilogy, he used that trade to make his own rules.  In this film he works it to the best of his ability and learns as he goes along.  Here he has a teacher.  The old man.  Lee Van Cleef.  The teacher. The man with the past.     Leon invented the core of spaghetti westerns, which is the protagonist must have a grudge against the villain, which makes their confrontation spiritual and more dramatic.   This has been used to good and mostly bad effects by thousands of action films since.   Nobody used it better the Leon.  Here Van Cleef is our protaginist and not Eastwood.  In this film the man with no name watches and learns and assists. Plies his trade and the emotion is left to his teacher and the villain.This film is superb and better then the first film.  Our villain is evil and psychotic and smart and greedy.   Our hero is greedy, smart and silent.   He learns to love his teacher and helps him get the revenge.  He then keeps what he wants.  The money.    yet we love him.  We love the teacher and we love to hate the villain.  A classic in film fantasy enjoyment.  The West is given a real feel of a period long time ago.  And if it was wild the west is shown here to be just that.   Sheriffs are bought and sold and the fast gun rules.A must for all true movie fans.   And then it was followed by act III..."
zippyjimbo,"Apr 8, 2000",9/10,"One of my favorite movie lines of all time as spoken by Klaus Kinski upon recognizing Lee Van Cleef in the little cantina as the one who used his (Klaus') cheek to strike his match earlier in the movie.  When Kinski ask if he ""remember me, amigo,"" Van Cleef just reply ""uh uh.""  To which he's asked to try that trick again, which prompts Van Cleef to utter another one of my all time lines - ""I generally don't smoke 'til after I've eaten; why don't you come back in five minutes.""  Just typing this brings smiles to my face. I've been a Lee Van Cleef fan since High Noon (with Robert Wilke) and Kansas City Confidential (with Jack Elam and Neville Brand!) and this was/is the movie that made him a star.  Granted it didn't last for long, but he did have his 15 minutes.  This is my favorite Spaghetti Western, it was also my first (didn't see ""Fistful"" until much later - and Good, Bad, Ugly was a major disappointment - I wanted Van Cleef to play the same role).  And the music, especially the pipe organ, just blows my mind.  Highly enjoyable; think I'll go and watch it again."
Ray H.,"Jul 21, 2009",9/10,"A perfect good vs evil western. Clint Eastwood is cool and strong, and never gives up. Lee Van Cleef is mature and sensible, but sturdy. Gian Maria Volontè is thoroughly brutal and cruel. All three show us a perfect professionalism and are equally attractive, and the equilibrium of these three actors keep us thrilled and excited to the end. The land is vast, the sky is blue and the mountains are steep. Ennio Morricone's music is a perfect match to this film, and the opening whistle melody echoes in the head even after finishing the film.Clint Eastwood is now a giant actor, producer and director in front of us, but we should never forget his starting point as an actor such as in this film, which impresses us for good."
FightingWesterner,"Nov 11, 2011",10/10,"The second film in Sergio Leone's mislabeled ""Man With No Name"" trilogy, takes the tone, music, violence, and hard-boiled character types from the first film and lets them rip, making for some really big entertainment.Henry Fonda's role in Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West is often referred to as ""the coldest villain in screen history"". As the bandit El Indio, Gian Maria Volante has him totally beaten! He and Lee Van Cleef also threaten to top Eastwood in the screen presence department, with the whole trio giving the title characters in The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly a good run for their money as well.The rousing score by Ennio Morricone (probably his best) is used wall-to-wall and cranked up to full effect, drenching the action in operatic sound and western atmosphere.An interesting fact, is that United Artist's lateness in purchasing For A Few Dollars More resulted in the studio owning the film, though not the music rights, which were (and still are) controlled by RCA Records. In order to fix the situation, United Artist Records' musical director Leroy Holmes orchestrated his own arrangements of Morricone's score and released an alternate soundtrack LP, with the official movie poster on the front, a photograph of Eastwood on the back, and liner notes promising many more sequels to come! Never released on CD, it's actually pretty lively and worth seeking out."
deloudelouvain,"Aug 3, 2020",9/10,"There are a lot of movies that I liked when I was young that didn't age well but For A Few Dollars More isn't one of them, it's still a great movie. I loved those spaghetti westerns from Sergio Leone when they came out and I still love them now. For A Few Dollars More is certainly one of the best ones, and even fifty-five years later it still rocks. Sergio Leone knows how to make villains likable, he knows how to make a story suspenseful with not a lot of words. The close-ups from the characters are already enough to bring that tension that we love so much. It has to be said that the cast is very well chosen. Every single one of them looks like a bandit, or just a mean guy you wouldn't want to meet in a dark alley. But what to say about the soundtrack? Ennio Morricone is or was (since he passed this year) the master of soundtracks. Who doesn't know those typical spaghetti western soundtracks, we all heared them before and we can all whistle them during the movie. To this day I still think Morricone has the most recognizable soundtracks. This soundtrack was in fact the first I ever bought on cd later on, a masterpiece if you ask me, the perfect sound to add to the suspense during the stand offs in this movie. The stand offs in this western are legendary, like in all other Sergio Leone westerns in fact. The only negative I could write about the sound in this western would be the fistfights that don't sound real, I guess that wasn't their forte in 1965. The acting on the other hand was just mesmerizing. Lee Van Cleef (one of my all time favorites in these kind of movies) and Clint Eastwood did a terrific job with their characters, but also Gian Maria Volontè and the young Klaus Kinski. This movie will forever stay a classic in this genre, after so many years it's still as enjoyable to watch as the first time I watched it. Definitely the movie you have to watch if you like westerns."
latsblaster,"Jun 21, 2003",10/10,"This was my favorite-Western before I discovered ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (English title), Sergio Leone's superior-masterpiece. But when I keep on mentioning ""For a Few Dollars More"" (English title), people to not follow me in the same way. These two Leone-movies have many differences, but they still have something in common. Booth has the excitement and the hard core mood that I seldom find in other movies.The story: The film might seem thin  but keeps into it's own core. Instead of focus on too much story, Leone's direction, the set design, the costumes, the presence of the actors and Morricone's music gets in focus and creates an unforgettable masterpiece and one of the most entertaining movies ever. A Western like this doesn't need more story than it has.The storytelling: The film starts with the presentation of colonel Douglas Mortimer, reading in the bible on a train which he stops by his own hand ... the next scene contains 'The Return' of the man with no name ... wee see Clint Eastwood walking through the rain at the side of his horse, lighting a cigar before he enters a smoke-filled saloon. These first eminent scenes contains superb duels, and in spite of the fact that they are long, they have the highest suspense and tempo with booth silence and Morricone's pumping music combined with typical Leone-exaggerated sound effects which steals your whole attention. The presentation of the three main characters takes almost 30 minutes. Slow and boring? I found these 30 minutes to be the best part of this film and this excellent start of the movie makes it a classic in the Western AND in the Action genre! After this amazing start, the tempo becomes a bit slower but the rest of the movie is still a masterpiece...The heroes: The man with no name (Clint Eastwood) is harder than ever  Clint is at his best from start to end. Than we have Lee van Cleef, in his best performance, as Douglas Mortimer. He is VERY cool and mean here. Forget about the sequel ""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" (English title). This is his best role. Lee is superb as the former colonel, a relaxed and smart hero in black clothes, wearing lots of weapons ...The villains: A filthy, evil, rotten, bloodthirsty Gian Maria Volenté is El Indio (not as handsome as in ""A fistful of Dollars"" (English title) but just as powerful and even more menacing) and he has a bunch of bandits where Klaus Kinski, Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli makes great performances as really tough and bad guys. Just watching Luigi Pistilli in his best shape and a truly spectacular Klaus Kinski can make anyone satisfied.The direction: When it comes to Leone himself this is one of his most personal and stylish directions. No other movie has succeeded to imitate this perfect film. It is not just an Italian Western. This is a fast-paced action-movie. It is loud, fast and mean. Sergio Leone's camera ... with his close ups, the perfect editing, the never-ending pans ... the loud noise from the pistols and the riffles ... and the screams of dying desperadoes.The music: Ennio Morricone has made many good soundtracks, but I think that this is his best together with the one in ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" (English title). They are two different kinds of Morricone-soundtracks; this is the tough one, the other more operatic and in classic style.The trilogy: The other Dollar-movies misses the pace and speed of this one. This Dollar-movie has the toughest action scenes. From the start to end, the guns keep on shooting...Rating: 10 of 10."
TheFilmConnoisseur,"Jun 27, 2003",10/10,"****Excellent***Good**Fair*PoorMy teacher once said that when you're starting your career it's great to imitate someone just as practice or to gain experience because if you can be as good as them you could be better! And that's exactly what happened to Sergio Leone.After the success of A Fistful of Dollars a sequel was underway and that gave Leone and Eastwood the opportunity to make this character into there own. Here Eastwood is a bounty hunter not a simple gunfighter like in the original. He teams up with another bounty hunter played by Lee Van Cleef who both are after Indio for two different reasons.In this film Leone emerges as an artist. When this film was released times were changing. The new and old generation were in a battle. The vietnam war had just begun and hippies were taking over the country. By pairing the characters of Eastwood and Van Cleef there was bound to be conflicts.""They usually end up shooting themselves in the back.""From their partnership they understood and learned from each other. Meaning there is something new to be learned from each generation.RATING: 4 STARS"

During their enterprise, there will be lots of bullets and funny situations. In the end, one of the bounty hunters shows the real intention of his hunting.

ma-cortes,"Sep 1, 2010",8/10,"It's the second installment of the ¨Dollars trilogy¨ along with ¨ For a handful of dollars¨ and ¨The good ,the bad and the ugly¨ with Eastwood as ¨Man with no name¨. The epitome of the SW is violent, beautifully crafted and exaggerated , it pits crafty ¨Man with no name¨ though named Manco (Clint Eastwood) and shifty Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef as old man , however in reality Clint was already 35 and Lee only 40 when was filmed ) forming an uneasy alliance against badder guy named Indio (Gian Maria Volonte ) but their reasons to pursuit him are totally different . The bounty hunter gunslingers reluctantly join forces pitting the psychotic outlaw who uses twisted means to chase them and terminates in a deadly feud. ¨Man with no name¨ is helped by the old prophet (Joseph Egger who also appeared as gravedigger in For a handful of dollars).This classic original Western contains slow and deliberating filming , taciturn acting on cynical characters, sense of style , elaborate shoot-outs , and portentous close-ups of grime-encrustred faces with bloodbaths including high body-count as total kill count: 30, though two of the murders were heard, but not shown . Unforgettable scenes as when Lee Van Cleef fires a match on the back of the hunchback Klaus Kinski , the spectacular final duel , and many others . The impact of this Spaghetti opened the gate for the huge numbers of Italian-Spaniard Western which made fortune for their producers and directors in the sixties and early seventies . The trilogy made Eastwood an international star previously better-known for his running character in TV series ¨Rawhide¨. Leone did revive his career almost instantly on the strength of these films . All of Eastwood's later Western and his ¨Dirty Harry¨ movies owe a considerable debt to Leone. Furthermore appear Leone's habitual secondaries acting as ominous hoodlums such as Mario Brega , Benito Stefanelli , Aldo Sambrell , Antonio Molino Rojo, Lorenzo Robledo, Jose Canalejas , Frank Braña , among them.Ennio Morricone's musical score is terrific with sensational compositions blending human voice, guitar and buzzing harmonica, the atonal soundtrack has been imitated and copied thousand times . Excellent production design by Carlo Simi , Leone's usual and cinematography by Massimo Dallamano is fascinating . ¨For a few dollars more ¨was filmed in acceptable budget during several weeks in location on austere outdoors of Golden City (Sierra of Madrid), Hoyo De Manzanares , Colmenar Viejo, Madrid , and Almeria : Albaricoques and Tabernas ; besides interiors located on Cinecitta Roman studios . This quintessential 'Spaguetti' originated great influence of wide range in Western and changed the face of the genre . It was such a good picture that had a great success , it expanded in a flood of Italian/Spanish Westerns, but none hold a candle to Leone's masterpiece . The ¨trilogy of the dollars ¨ is followed by ¨ Once upon a time in West¨and ¨Duck you sucker¨. For Leone enthusiasts with his usual trademarks , it's full of which made his films so memorable, others might find it a bit long but no one can deny its sense of style what achieved a great burst of world-wide popularity ."
nickdesouza,"May 13, 2004",7/10,"Eastwood for me is wooden and surpassed in acting quality of Van Cleef - in fact I think the film would have been better if only one bounty hunter took on El Indio - i.e Eastwood isn't needed. The film is slicker - more money was obviously poured into this production - than Fistful. But in that film Eastwood is clever, the plot and twists are satisfying and the bad guys' characters are well developed but just as nasty. Still, it's a fun film and the gun fights are exciting. I have yet to see The Good, The Bad and The Ugly and cannot wait until I do. If it contains the intelligent plot of Fistful with the beauty and intense nature of Once Upon A Time in the West, then it'll be a winner in my book. If, however, it is solely about gun fights and dilutes the main characters' impact by having too many of them as in A Few Dollars, then I'd likely give it the same mark - 7/10."
alirezazamani-73059,"Oct 30, 2020",1/10,"I don't hate western movies but this is really terrible movie and extremely boring!
definitely""A Fistful of Dollars"" is better than this movie!"
Leofwine_draca,"Jul 19, 2016",9/10,"Sergio Leone's follow-up to his breakthrough A FISTFUL OF DOLLARS retains much of the exaggerated style of that film, except that this one is even better. This is mainly because a higher budget is evident, especially in the better cast. Once again, Ennio Morricone creates an appropriate and, it has to be said, brilliantly evocative score which is a highlight of the whole film. Although the running time comes in at two hours, this time flies by and is packed with plot twists and turns.The scorching desert locations are once again realistic and scene-setting; I especially liked the use of a white-walled ghost town which appears towards the film's end. Clint Eastwood reprises his role of The Man With No Name to great effect, although even here his thunder is stolen by Lee Van Cleef, who stars as a rival bounty hunter. Van Cleef is superb in this film, a real icon, and this is the film that made him famous. He has his lines and mannerisms directly right and the character seems to have been written for him, he fits it so well. The two men are supported by a criminal gang of really seedy-looking bad guys, headed by the excellent Gian Maria Volonte as Indio, the ruthless yet honourable murderer and robber who proves a worthwhile opponent for Eastwood and Van Cleef to take on. Klaus Kinski is also good in a small role as a hunchback whom Van Cleef uses to light a match - an act that Kinski isn't too pleased about.Opening with two well-staged scenes highlighting the shooting abilities of Eastwood and Van Cleef as they both track down wanted criminals, this film is well-photographed and edited throughout, with a sufficiently complex plot to carry it through. The ending is brilliant, and a classic one, with Morricone's powerful score suddenly sweeping over the final shoot-out. Things end on a high note with a great joke as well. Although Leone, Eastwood and Van Cleef would re-team again in 1966's THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, their three distinctive styles are immortalised in this classic film."
one9eighty,"Jun 1, 2020",9/10,"Hired for the same job, two bounty hunters (Eastwood and Van Cleef) must first get over each other in order to bring justice to Gian Maria Volonte. Each has their own unique style which could be an asset or a hindrance to the task at hand. A beautifully crafted Sergio Leone Spaghetti Western with plenty of blood, sweat and bullets.This is the second film in the Dollars trilogy (or Man with No Name trilogy, or even the Blood Money trilogy), the first being ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and the last being ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"". Be careful how you interpret the word trilogy though, these aren't linked, they are just a good collection of films with similar actors in.This film isn't just a great western, but it's actually a great film outside the world of the genre too (yes it is a western, but think of how it's constructed in comparison to other films, all he ingredients are there!). It's exciting, gripping and has lots of atmosphere and emotion. The 3 central stars, Eastwood, Van Cleef, and Volonte) all deliver great performances. Wrapped up in Leone's brilliant direction and writing, with Ennio Morricone's perfect musical score - this is a fantastic film all around. What Leone does particularly well, apart from painting an absorbing artistic canvas on screen with scenery and characters, is to show that good guys and bad guys can overlap. To become a hero sometimes the good guy has to do bad things. Likewise, the bad guy sometimes do have good side or morality.Due to being created to depict a certain period of time, the film itself doesn't lose anything with age. As good today as it was in the 60's.⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ 9/10"
jcbutthead86,"Oct 24, 2014",10/10,"For A Few Dollars More is one of the greatest Westerns ever made,an excellent and unforgettable classic that's filled with amazing direction,great performances,incredible Action and a fantastic score. All of those elements make For A Few Dollars More a terrific film and one of my favorite movies that is Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood at their best.For A Few Dollars More tells the story of The Man With No Name(his name is Monco in this film)who is now a bounty hunter who teams up with fellow bounty hunter Colonial Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef)to take down sadistic outlaw Indio(Gian Maria Volonte)dead or alive.After the Box Office success of A Fistful Of Dollars director Sergio Leone and Clint Eastwood were both asked to do a follow up and the two responded with For A Few Dollars More the second film in The Man With No Name/Dollars trilogy and is a brilliant,thrilling and intense Western classic that grabs you by the throat and doesn't let go until the very end and will keep you glued to the screen. Sergio Leone was given a much larger budget with than the one in Fistful and it truly shows because with For A Few Dollars More Leone expands the scope of Fistful and gives this movie a bigger and much larger canvas that is gripping and incredible with an epic style that is operatic. Where as Fistful was inspired by Akira Kurosawa's Youjimbo Leone For A Few Dollars More comes up with his own story and does it in a flawless and stylish way that is pretty amazing. With each of The Man With No Name/Dollars movies Leone's style grew and led all the way up to his masterpiece The Good,The Bad And The Ugly where Leone took the trilogy to a higher level. If A Fistful Of Dollars was about the war between two rival families then For A Few Dollars More about how life and death has a price and outlaws were brutal and vicious with violence being the only option and Leone gives us a stylish yet gritty look at the Old West. What makes FFDM so great and interesting is the teaming of The Man With No Name(Monco)with Mortimer because we see both of them are good bounty hunters by themselves but together they make a lethal combination and both want to capture Indio but for different reasons. Monco wants to capture Indio for the money where as Mortimer wants Indio for the money and personal reasons which makes Mortimer a strong and complex character. Monco and Mortimer like any duo that teams up together have clashes because both either want to do their own thing or it's because of their different personalities but the two start to respect each other. You will enjoy the relationship between the tough and gritty character Monco and Mortimer. Where as Monco and Mortimer are charming and likable antiheroes the character Indio who is the villain in the film is a horrible and vicious character who is so evil that he has no chance for redemption or to be good again because when ever kills a person Indio does it with a twisted glee that is disturbing. Every time Indio showed up on screen you feel like no one is safe from his violent wrath and you are rooting for Monco and Mortimer to catch him. Indio is a character you will never forget and is one of the most intense characters you will ever see in a Western film. While FFDM is without a doubt a classic and one of Leone and Eastwood's best the movie is often seen as the weakest film in the trilogy. I guess the reason some people say that is because it's not as groundbreaking as A Fistful Of Dollars or as epic and sprawling like The Good,The Bad And The Ugly or the story is isn't strong. In my opinion the story in FFDM is strong and had enough greatness the keep viewers entertained. The Action and gunfights in FFDM are truly thrilling and are done with white hot tension and suspense that never quits. The ending in For A Few Dollars More is outstanding and a classic finale filled Action,explosive moments and surprises. A terrific ending.The cast is great. Clint Eastwood is excellent once again as The Man With No Name(Monco)with Eastwood commanding the screen. Lee Van Cleef is brilliant as Colonial Douglas Mortimer and has great chemistry with Eastwood. Gian Maria Volonte is amazing and intense as Indio a sadistic outlaw. Mario Brega(Nino),Luigi Pistilli(Groggy)and Klaus Kinski(Juan Wild)give good performances as well.The direction by Sergio Leone is fantastic and stylish with Leone always moving the camera using close-ups,zooms and creative visual style. Amazing direction,Leone.The score by Ennio Morricone is dazzling,haunting and epic and matches the tone of the movie perfectly. Another great score,Morricone.In final word,if you love Sergio Leone,Clint Eastwood,Westerns or films in general,I highly suggest you see For A Few Dollars More,one of the greatest Westerns ever made and an excellent,unforgettable classic that you will watch again and again. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
MadReviewer,"May 8, 2001",9/10,"When discussing the amazing films of Sergio Leone, the one movie that usually gets lost in the shuffle is `For a Few Dollars More'.  This is slightly understandable, since it's just a hair below the impossibly good standards of `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' and `Once Upon a Time in the West' (among others), but there's no denying that `For a Few Dollars More' is still a terrific movie in its own right.  In fact, if judged on its own merits instead of in comparison to Leone's other works, it's nearly a classic.`For a Few Dollars More' pretty much picks up right where `A Fistful of Dollars' left off  the Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood), who's now been dubbed `Manco' by a couple of his fellow bounty hunters, is working his way through the Old West, systematically picking off and collecting the reward for despicable criminals and other lowlifes.  He's worked his way up to hunting down the most ruthless bandit of them all, Indio (the incredibly underrated Gian Maria Volonté), a depraved killer who's recently escaped from prison.  Also on the hunt for Indio, however, is the bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), who has a personal score to settle with the killer.  The film becomes an interesting three-way game of cat and mouse, as Colonel Mortimer and the Man With No Name struggle to work around (and with) each other, as well as to hunt down Indio, who's decided he's not going to be taken down without a fight.Eastwood's portrayal of The Man With No Name really getting to flourish for the first time in this film  there's glimpses of it in `A Fistful of Dollars', but this is the first time it becomes apparent how weirdly moral the Man With No Name is.  He can be a bloodthirsty, brutal bully at times, but he only acts that way around people he thinks deserve to knocked down a peg or two.  To women, children (at least the ones that try to steal from him), and others he considers to be `innocent', the Man With No Name is surprisingly deferential, even kind.  There's a lot of complexity to the character, and Eastwood pulls it off with some serious style.Van Cleef is also great as Colonel Mortimer, although it's weird to see him in this film as Mortimer and then in `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly' as the dastardly Angel Eyes  the two characters are such complete opposites. Mortimer is a lot like the Man With No Name  adhering to a strange code of honor, doing heroic things by often unheroic methods.  Because of their similarities, the relationship between the two characters is terrific, veering between complete distrust and grudging respect.  In a way, `For a Few Dollars' more is one of the first modern `buddy' action movies  the way Eastwood and Van Cleef interact with each other seems eerily like the predecessor to movies like `Lethal Weapon' and `48 Hours'.Director Sergio Leone does a great job with this film as well  the initial meeting between The Man With No Name and Colonel Mortimer is appropriately tense, bordering on near film perfection.  So are the scenes with Indio and his gang (watch Indio's storytelling explanation about how he plans to rob a bank), as well as the final confrontation between all the characters -- awesome.  Leone also uses the score of Ennio Morricone to great effect, using a haunting little tune from Indio's pocket watch to great effect throughout the film.  The pacing, the backgrounds, the shot set-ups  all awesome.  Leone's one of the unappreciated film greats of all time.`For a Few Dollars More' is simply a fantastic film; if you haven't already seen this one, rent it immediately.  The only reason people don't rave about this as being one of the best Western of all time is because it fell between two cracks of Western perfection: `A Fistful of Dollars' and `The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'.Grade: A"
Vivekmaru45,"Oct 14, 2011",N/A,"Another good western (à la spaghetti!) by none other than yours truly: Sergio Leone! For those of you that do not know what a spaghetti western is, let me explain.Spaghetti Western, also known as Italo-Western, is a nickname for a broad sub-genre of Western films that emerged in the mid-1960s in the wake of Sergio Leone's unique and much copied film-making style and international box-office success, so named by American critics because most were produced and directed by Italians. The correct term for these films, in Italy, is western all'italiana (Italian-Style Western); British critics tended to use the label Continental Western to describe these films, and the phrase 'Spaghetti Western' was originally created by American critics as a derogatory name for this group of films but has over time become accepted by fans of the films. The language in which the movies were originally released was Italian as well, but as most of the films featured multilingual casts and sound was invariably post-synched, most Westerns all'Italiana do not have an official dominant language.Over to the film. The best actor here is Lee Von Cleef. Cleef played the villain in another legendary western directed by Leone: The Good, The Bad and The Ugly (1966). Here he's the good guy.Shoulder to shoulder to him is Gian Maria Volonté. And if you think about it he always is the iconic villain in Leone's films. The next in line is Clint Eastwood who supports Cleef well. Clint is a household name worldwide so I need not elaborate on him.Plot: Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gunslinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty he inquires about Red ""Baby"" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as ""Manco"".We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down El Indio, one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang.Meanwhile, Indio's men free him from prison where he was held. After hies release, Indio's primary goal is to rob the Bank of El Paso and its disguised safe containing ""almost a million dollars."" Mortimer persuades a reluctant Manco to join Indio's gang during the robbery in order to ""get him between two fires."" Manco is offered membership in the gang after rescuing one of Indio's friends from prison.What are Mortimer's reasons for pursuing Indio? Will he and Manco overcome Indio and his gang? Watch and find out! Verdict: Buy it on VCD/DVD/BLURAY! You may also like these: A Fistful of Dollars, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, Once Upon a Time in the West and Duck, You Sucker!"
Lechuguilla,"Oct 2, 2006",7/10,"In this 1965, mostly Italian produced, movie filmed in Spain, and dubbed in English, two show-offish bounty hunters in the American Southwest set their sights on a ruthless ""bandolero"". I consider this film to be a spoof of traditional villains from 1940's and 50's westerns.The dudes in this film are tough hombres. They smoke. They spit. They sneer. They sling their guns. They strut their macho stuff. But mostly, they just stare at each other and look mean.The story is melodramatic and the characters swagger to the max. But the scenery here is absolutely majestic. The expansive and lonesome badlands are beautiful in their stark desolation. And in some scenes the bleak desert images combine with one of the most hauntingly poetic musical scores in film history, to create an expression of true cinematic art.""For A Few Dollars More"" is one of those films that appeals to me more for the music and the cinematography than for the story."
naveensankaran18,"Nov 4, 2014",9/10,"I rarely see cowboy movies but got attracted to it with the Good, bad and the ugly and was stunned to see such a movie. I thought no other movie could better it and now I have to change my opinions! If the former was a perfect one for entertainment, then this one is perfect in almost everything. Couldn't find any holes. The performance of Clint Eastwood just got better here as the ""man with no name"" and ""the man in black"" Cleef is very good in this movie comparing good bad and ugly.The story was succinct, screen-played into a 131 minute epic with no unwanted scenes and with correct detailing in every shot. Thats what I call a must watch one!!As a critic, this one is better. But as a Eastwood fan, good bad ugly still is better and will be my favorite!"
cricketbat,"Dec 28, 2018",6/10,"For a Few Dollars more is definitely the weakest of the Dollars trilogy. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef make a good team, but it just drags on a bit too long. Plus, Ennio Morricone's score seems a little more grating than normal. Still, though, this is a classic Western and it's worth a watch."
drystyx,"Feb 5, 2007",2/10,"This is a typical spaghetti Western, which means it has great music and sound effects, and nothing else going for it. The plot is somewhat better than most Eastwood westerns. Two bounty hunters team up to chase down a gang. And there is an interesting duel involving the chimes on a watch. There, all interest ends. Some characters are like comic book super heroes, but without the explanation of being super heroes. For example, Superman was from Krypton and had super powers because he was an alien. The super powers of the two major characters here makes no sense. For that matter, neither do their characters. We're supposed to accept their vicious behavior, but why? No explanation. I challenge anyone to watch a spaghetti western without the sound, using just subtitles, and I guarantee that person will be bored to death. Great music, lots of meaningless action, ridiculous story lines, poor characters, poor acting, and poor writing."
jose-cruz53,"Nov 20, 2012",9/10,"This is one of the best films I ever seem and I have seem many. Yes, it is that good: as soon as I saw it the film jumped right near the top of my favorite films list.The reasons for this film greatness are many: the awesome characters, the presence of several high caliber actors which lead to the high level acting, the highly interesting plot and the cynical way which Leone portraits the Old West which contrasts with the more conventional work of John Ford's westerns (which I personally find rather boring) and the high integration between the score and the film: the film score is all around excellent and highly memorable. One knows that he or she is watching something great at the first minute of the film. This is one of the greatest westerns ever made and is among the best films of the 1960's, of any genre.It is also a highly entertaining and accessible film (unlike, for example, the stuff produced by Ingmar Bergman), so it would be a good experience for anyone.Highly recommended for anyone!"
Bob-45,"Oct 7, 2004",10/10,"Why is 'For a Few Dollars More' a great western? What makes a great western? While 'Unforgiven,' 'Dances With Wolves, 'The Wild Bunch' and 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' have lofty ideas, so does 'The Big Country,' and it's not a particularly great western. Personal westerns like 'The Hired Hand' and, particularly, 'Heartland' don't possess particularly lofty ideas, but they are great westerns. So what is it? I'm not sure there is an answer.What I do know is that I've seen 'For a Few Dollars More' eleven times, which is more than I've seen 'Unforgiven,' 'The Wild Bunch,' 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,' 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Dances With Wolves' put together. Is it because 'For a Few Dollars More' is entertaining? It most certainly is, but so are these other films, especially 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.' I think I love 'For a Few Dollars More' so much because, in addition to being beautifully written, it shares that hallmark gimmick so beautifully executed in 'The Six Sense;' that being, magic. By magic I mean the art of distraction. In both cases, the story we are watching is so satisfying, we aren't expecting the twist at the end, even though it was always right under our noses.'For a Few Dollars More' is one of those rare sequels that's better than the original, 'A Fistfull of Dollars'. The only other great sequels that can make that claim are 'The Empire Strikes Back' and 'The Godfather: Part II' . All three films succeed for the same reason: they use the audience familiarity with the characters and style to expand the storyline. Since we know at some point 'The Man With No Name' (Clint Eastwood) will show up, we can sit through the lengthy exposition which introduces two new main characters, 'The Man in Black' (Lee Van Cleef) and 'El Indio' (Gian Maria Volante). Both characters are compelling, Volante, especially. Indio is one of the darkest, vicious, tormented villains in the movies. Volante is so good we quickly forget he played the main villain, Ramon, in 'A Fistfull of Dollars. Van Cleef's bounty hunter, 'The Man in Black' is almost James Bondish with his assorted weapons and gadgets. However, Van Cleef's persona and looks gives the character a sense of suspenseful ambiguity. CAN this man in black be trusted? Eastwood's 'Man With No Name' is a more ruthless, treacherous character than he was in 'Fistfull of Dollars'. The opening scene, before the titles, shows and off-camera Eastwood bushwacking a bounty. Eastwood repeatedly betrays Van Cleef after the two bounty hunters join forces; he probably feels compelled to do so because 'The Man in Black' is consistently one step ahead of him. Leone takes great care contrasting the styles of the two bounty hunters. When Van Cleef researches Eastwood, he searches the newspapers until finding an article with a picture of the closing scene in 'Fistfull of Dollars; this establishes 'The Man in Black' as a more cerebral, systematic professional; it also reminds the audience of the first movie. When Eastwood researches Van Cleef, 'The Man With No Name' goes to see an old gossip, 'Prophet'. The scene between 'Prophet' and 'No Name' is initially funny; Leone does this to loosen up the audience, so Prophet's story about 'The Man in Black' is more affecting. 'Mortimer. Colonel Douglas Mortimer,' Prophet says, with a touch of sadness. 'The Man in Black' is genteel Southern aristocracy, a war hero, who's life dramatically changed over one tragic incident. Prophet doesn't tell us what that incident is, and it's mentioned only once by Eastwood and Van Cleef before the surprising climax of 'For A Few Dollars More'. While Leone establishes his dark villain 'Indio' as a sadistic psychopath, he and Volante create a character of surprising melancholy. An tragic incident, revealed by a series of increasingly descriptive flashbacks reveals Indio's life and happiness has been forever changed. Indio doesn't feel remorse for the incident; such a animal is incapable of guilt. Instead, Indio feels a great sense of loss, a loss so emotionally wrenching, Indio stays doped-up in order to endure.Indio plans to rob the bank of El Paso, and 'No Name' and Mortimer plan to capture him and his gang for the bounty. The robbery is a masterwork of editing comparable to the shower scene in 'Psycho'. Indio and his gang escape and 'No Name' and Mortimer set out after them. Mortimer has a genuine affection for 'No Name'. Just as well, since it's obvious Mortimer could easily kill 'No Name'. To reveal more would spoil the fun and there is a great deal of fun to be had in 'For a Few Dollars More.'Leone died at the age of 60, too young for such a man of genius. He directed only 13 films, three of which are bonafide masterpieces, 'For a Few Dollars More,' 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West'. Those three films were made within an astonishing 36 months. While both 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'The Good, The Bad & The Ugly' have grander themes (and much bigger budgets), neither is as well focused and surprising as 'For a Few Dollars More'. I give 'For a Few Dollars More' a '10'.Reading about Leone at the IMDb website, I was astonished to discover that two of his western films were never fully released in the US, 'The Magnificent Stranger' and 'The Genius'. Would somebody PLEASE put these movies on DVD? Leone permanently transformed the face of the American western. I'd certainly like to see these two 'lost' examples of his work."
ewarn-1,"Feb 6, 2007",10/10,"Many consider this film the most perfectly realized of Leone's trilogy, though I prefer the grander sweep of The Good The Bad and The Ugly. This is the best film in the series to start with, though, being slightly more polished than Fistful Of Dollars, and it's easier to follow as a template of the Leone style.Contrary to popular critical opinion, this is definitely not a 'revisionist' western. What Leone has done has stripped the traditional western story down to its essential elements and flipped it. Basically, this is an ordinary western saga seen through a distorted (or clearer, depending on your viewpoint) lens. All westerns were generally made with the same characteristics, that is, a good guy and a bad guy. The good guy was simple: a lawman or rancher protecting something. The bad guy was usually the more interesting one. Leone made the so called 'good guy' more interesting, and more vicious than the villain. The story becomes the mirror image of the American Western, reflected from the deserts of Spain.Eastwood, despite the dispute of others, is ""The Man With No Name"", and it's not only his identity that's unknown, it's his motives, his purpose, his origin. He's the focal point of the story, even though here he spends a lot of background time, letting Van Cleef and the others stand out in many striking scenes. This is Leone's genius at work. We never forget Eastwood is there, somewhere.The two great characteristics of the trilogy are the close-ups and the music. These are better done here than in the others. Seeing this film for the first time, I was struck by the faces, which seemed to jump out of the screen from another place and time, definitely not the west of ""Gunsmoke"". The soundtrack, both stirring and haunting, will be celebrated a century from now. But the most amazing thing about this movie is that a film created on another continent and with a cast and crew of mostly Europeans is considered one of the greatest American Westerns."
bobsgrock,"Oct 20, 2008",9/10,"Even better than his first groundbreaking Western, Sergio Leone does himself one better in this second film of his Man With No Name ""trilogy."" In this story, Eastwood conquers the screen as a bounty hunter known as Monco, who finds himself in deals with another named Colonel Mortimer who has a secret agenda for completing this mission. As these two titans of terror combine their powers, the stage is set for one of the most breathtaking, operatic, and violent showdowns in the Western genre.As I said before, director Leone does wonders with this new-found style he uses in these spaghetti westerns as he sets up each scene and does it with such grace and perfect execution, you can't help but be amazed. With so many intense close-ups, fast-paced editing, and dizzying flashbacks, the story is crystal-clear and even brings out the best in the actors who are great nevertheless. Eastwood is so perfect in this role it's no wonder he became an icon; and Lee Van Cleef also does great as the Colonel. Maybe the best performance belongs to Gian Maria Volonte as the drug-induced, crazy villain El Indio. All these great actors, the superb storyline and the beautiful landscape combine to make this one of the best Westerns, if not one of the best films of all time. This is a timeless and exciting piece of work that will never lose its flavor."
bob the moo,"Jan 3, 2003",N/A,"Two bounty killers do well plying their trade in the west to great effect. When a large bounty is put on put on the head of the bandit El Indio both men find themselves out to collect.  They strike a partnership to go after him and his gang together and split the bounty.  However both men have different things in mind and try to double cross each other and adding bits to the plot that the other didn't expect.  Meanwhile El Indio also has his own plans to outsmart the two and make off with more than his fair share of the money.For a Few Dollars More is a strange beast.  The sequel to a Fistful of Dollars this is both better and not as good in equal measure.  The plot is less fun that the original although it is full of little twists and turns which, while good, aren't as good as the original.  Too much is going on and the plot is a little too twisty for my liking but it is still enjoyable. All the trappings of the spaghetti western are there and are good.Leone's direction is also good and he has the same style he had in the original, although not at the level he masterly commands in The Good, The Bad and the Ugly.  The use of music is excellent and haunting although the story doesn't always support it as well as it would in later Leone films (both the `once upon a time in.' films come to mind).  E Indio's pocket watch is well used in several stand-offs but also sparks several of the usual flashback scenes.Eastwood is good but suffers from sharing the same running time with Van Cleef.  The two are good together but not as good as they will be later and both men needed more time to establish themselves.  Volonte is good as El Indio and is not allowed to be just a bad guy, but to have a past and pain that haunts him.Overall if you liked Fistful of Dollars then you'll enjoy this.  It isn't as good as The Good, The Bad etc but it is a classic piece of spaghetti western  from the score, the direction right down to the customary showdown."
ackstasis,"Jul 9, 2008",7/10,"Watching 'For a Few Dollars More (1965)' is a bit like experiencing vertigo, the camera zooming in and pulling back at the same time. Sergio Leone's explosive Spaghetti Western debut 'A Fistful of Dollars (1964)' was produced on a shoestring budget, and, though the financial restraints are easily noticeable in the final cut, the film has such a unique visual style that it didn't really matter. For his follow-up, Leone had a considerably-larger budget with which to toil, and the result is a more coherent and assured editing style, the work of consummate professional. However, at the same time, this creative progression has a simultaneous detrimental effect. Leone, in attempting to craft a (slightly) more conventional picture, was now less inclined to indulge in the unashamedly erratic editing  such as instant cuts from vast landscapes to sweat-soaked eyes  that had made his previous film so utterly unique. Nevertheless, great film-making is about finding that ideal balance, and it's reassuring to note that the director did eventually strike it with his next picture, 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1966).'In a decade when the Western was beginning to fall out of favour, many Italian directors decided to attempt their own interpretations of the genre, none more successfully than Sergio Leone. These ""Spaghetti Westerns"" dispensed with all respectability that the genre had once possessed, saturating the cinema screen with sweat, blood and smoke. His films are not particularly intellectual, but generations of audiences have delighted in the director's sheer enthusiasm for providing entertainment, and his ""Dollars"" trilogy is now regarded as a classic. 'For a Few Dollars More' was produced second in the loose trilogy, but, chronologically, its storyline is the last to take place. Clint Eastwood returned from his previous star-making performance as the enigmatic ""Man With No Name"" {though he does, in fact, go by the title Monco}, and Gian Maria Volontè is deliciously-evil as the ultimate bad guy, El Indio. Though I had fully expected Lee Van Cleef to be also playing a villain, Douglas Mortimer, a respected colonel-turned-bounty hunter, turned out to be a highly-reputable figure, and his performance is marked by a subtle humour that contrasts well with Eastwood's ""straight man.""The film opens with an ominous intertitle: ""where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared."" These bounty-hunters turn out to be the film's heroes, and we can only watch in awe as Manco and Mortimer expertly go about their daily profession, tracking down wanted fugitives, swiftly murdering them (typically after offering an opportunity to defend themselves) and claiming the hefty reward. Beyond their grizzled exterior, each man has a very definite reason for their chosen line of work: Monco wishes to amass enough money to retire somewhere quiet, and Mortimer is out to avenge the rape and death of his sister. But what happens when the two professional killers set their sights on the same target, perhaps the most lucrative prize of all? Will they decide to cooperate, or will they end up shooting each other in the back? There is a wonderful sequence where the two bounty-hunters match wits, progressively humiliating each other in a bizarre ritual that involves shooting the other man's hat. Also watch out for Klaus Kinski, in that ""psycho"" mode that only he could play to perfection."
dooglesdead,"Mar 26, 2009",10/10,"I recently watched this movie for the first time after finally finding somewhere to rent it from (thankyou Lovefilm). My first impression was simply thinking wow, why haven't I heard more about this movie?I understand the fame of it's trilogy partners, as A Fistful Of Dollars was Eastwood's debut western and The Good, The Bad and The Ugly was the first Leone film to be widely advertised at it's release, but For A Few Dollars More breaks the pattern of the middle film in the trilogy being the poorest, as it is genuinely the most enjoyable watch of the three. I think that the feel of the movie is about as close as Leone could have got to perfection. Perhaps the most obvious reason for this is that the plot is based on bounty hunting, which just works so well. It's a storyline that you feel like you've seen a thousand times (probably on Warner Bros cartoons), but pulled off in the most satisfying way imaginable.I honestly can't sing this film's praises enough. Agreed, the whole trilogy is a masterpiece, but this one has the balance between a great music score, involving plot lines, superb one-liners, inspiring acting, exciting shootouts and memorable characters down to an absolute fine art. All I can say is well done Leone, you outdid yourself on this one. It's rekindled my love for the Spaghetti Western."
joeravioli,"Aug 8, 2016",6/10,"I'm a sucker for Westerns, apparently. Who wouldn't be? Few such works of uninhibited masculinity exist, and fewer still are entertaining enough to maintain my interest for more than an hour at a time, much less three. Fewer still pulsate with the raw energy and power embodied in those empty spaces, those quiet staring contests between men capable of blowing each other to bits with a twitch of their dusty digits, those treacherous wastelands, those hostile encounters, and those crusty, bearded, cigarette-chewing men imbued with only a desire to survive and succeed, no matter the cost. And in the case of this film, fewer still can boast being the established icons of the genre, the first films that come associated with the word ""Western"".Then why is For a Few Dollars More as middling as it is? In my humble opinion, For a Few Dollars More pales in comparison to its predecessor, the wonderfully entertaining Fistful of Dollars. The reasons for this are not few in number, but rather small in breadth. Basic, technical slip-ups resulting in an experience that feels curiously thinner and less satisfying. Sure, For a Few Dollars More has its moments, but when taken as a whole, it's a forgettable film that lacks the intelligence, energy, and sheer grit of the first and third films in Sergio Leone's legendary Dollars trilogy.As with its predecessor (but unlike its sequel), For a Few Dollars More concerns itself with moments rather than a calculated execution of a narrative. This in itself is excusable; it leads to a sort of haphazard adventure tinged with potent thrill. A scant narrative is undoubtedly better than one burdened by inscrutable complexity. But For a Few Dollars More simply can't deliver on those moments comprising its sustenance. Most of them, excluding a fantastic scene involving hats -- which I consider the second best scene in the whole trilogy -- are honestly quite boring. Leone draws them out to unnecessary length, which, while delivering on his old West portraits of masculinity, seem to stretch on indefinitely without sufficient reason or motivation. This effect is worsened by the fact that Leone gives us little to care about. In the first film, one could easily appreciate Eastwood's raw intelligence; after some time, it would be easy to care about him, at least to the point that you hope that he survives the predicament in which he finds himself.In a Few Dollars More, Eastwood's character is sidelined to allow Lee Van Cleef, who plays another superhuman bounty killer, to take center stage. And Van Cleef's cockiness destroys any notion of sympathy we might have had for him, while Eastwood, without sufficient space to exercise his intelligence, becomes a violent rodent far removed from the Bugs Bunny-ish wit of his original character. The villain is interesting as well, but Leone spends too much time making him seem troubled which serves little purpose. I don't like it when writers see fit to direct our sympathy towards unsympathetic characters. If Leone wanted to insert some effective character development, he should have given the villain's henchmen more screen time. By the time the film reached its disjointed and confusing climactic battle, I was still trying to figure out who everyone even was.The rest of the film is a whole lot of sitting and waiting. The innovation runs dry by the second half and the thrills die quickly off the mark. The action scenes feel limp and overdone while the staredowns become predictable. The ending is nowhere near as satisfying as the ending of Fistful of Dollars. And as with the other two, the dubbing is disgusting.I'm a sucker for Westerns, yes, but that doesn't mean that I'm completely blind to mediocrity. Of course, as I gave this film a generous 6, I can't say for certain that I'm seeing clearly."
theognis2,"Sep 25, 2021",5/10,"This highly stylized, wildly exaggerated ""western"" is more closely akin to the farces of Laurel & Hardy (note the slow burns and gradually escalating comic violence) to anything we might expect from John Ford or Sam Peckinpah. The fancy visual style is needed to distract from the feeble plotting. After a bazillion hours of TV westerns, including Eastwood in ""Rawhide,"" there may have been nowhere else to go. Still, despite the remarkable innovative score by Ennio Morricone, it's a dull show. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef do a fine job in their Stan and Ollie moments and Gian Maria Volonte is almost as scary as Walter Long, but all the laughter of the cast does not make up for the lack of laughter in the audience."
lee_eisenberg,"Jul 7, 2017",10/10,"The second installment of Sergio Leone's Dollars trilogy has the Man with No Name and a colonel teaming up to stop an outlaw. ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" (""A Few Dollars More"" in English) naturally lets Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef do their stuff, but I think that a lot of the credit should go to Gian Maria Volontè as the ruthless criminal El Indio. I'm talking one nasty dude. As is the case with ""A Fistful of Dollars"", there's not much dialogue, just subtle action. Eastwood's face does as much talking as any dialogue.Part of what was great about the spaghetti westerns is that they presented a more accurate image of the old west. Far from the glamorized depictions in movies starring John Wayne, Roy Rogers and Gene Autry (where the men are clean-shaven and the women wear fancy dresses), the spaghetti westerns depicted the old west as dismal and the people as greasy. I understand that the area in Spain where they filmed these movies is known as the Frying Pan (when my parents went to Spain, they drove through the town where a lot of the movies got filmed).Anyway, there's a good time to be had here. I hope to eventually see ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly""."
Michael_Elliott,"Nov 22, 2012",N/A,"For a Few Dollars More (1965)*** 1/2 (out of 4)The second film in Sergio Leone's trilogy has rival bounty hunters (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef) agreeing to work together to try and bring down the ruthless Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang. FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a major improvement over the previous film and it's also one of the best Spaghetti Westerns ever made. The film is a lot better made than the previous installment and instead of just one great character we're given two and a terrific villain as well. The entire film just has a more epic feel to it as Leone doesn't go for just style but instead he takes his time in telling the story, letting us get to know the characters and the entire situation just slowly builds up to the terrific finale. Of course, the story itself is just a fun one with two great bounty hunters wanting money and going for a main score. The opening to the film is terrific as we get to see how both hunters work and you get a clear picture that both of them have different styles but the end result is always the same. It obviously doesn't hurt that Eastwood and Van Cleef are so terrific in their parts. You really couldn't have thought up a better duo for this picture and the two actors do a very good job and especially in their scenes together. Gian Maria Volonte is also extremely good as the villain and it was fun seeing Klaus Kinski in his role as the hunchback. The cinematography by Massimo Dallamano and the music by Ennio Morricone perfectly blend together and with the story and action. FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is certainly one of the best of its kind and deserves its reputation."
rbverhoef,"May 25, 2004",8/10,"'For a Few Dollars More' is the second movie in the ""Man With No Name""-trilogy starring Clint Eastwood and directed by Sergio Leone. It is not as good as the first, 'A Fistful of Dollars', but comes close to it. The third, of course, is the masterpiece 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. This trilogy together with 'Once Upon a Time in the West' and 'Once Upon a Time in America' show us how great a director Leone actually is. Although this movie is the least of all I mentioned above it still belongs to the best westerns I have seen.The story is almost as simple as it can be. Two bounty hunters, one played by Clint Eastwood, the other by Lee Van Cleef (who was ""the bad"" in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'), work together to get an outlaw. They each have their motives, both are not really people you can trust, both are great with their guns.With Leone it is not really what is happening but how it is presented to the viewer. Often shown with close-ups of sweaty faces Leone knows how to create suspense in a gun fight where you can predict the outcome because Eastwood is in it. But not only Leone deserves credit for this movie, or actually the complete trilogy. Eastwood is in his element here and he makes sure the choice of greatest western star is not necessarily John Wayne. Van Cleef, who normally plays real villains, is terrific here as what seems to be a good guy. Another memorable thing is Ennio Morricone's score. Although his most famous scores are from 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' and 'Once Upon a Time in the West' he also adds something to the atmosphere in this movie (and of course 'A Fistful of Dollars'). Leone, Morricone and Eastwood have created a great trilogy. With 'For a Few Dollars More' as the least movie but nonetheless a very good one, enough is said."

GBU has Ely Wallach, Ffdm has Gian Maria Volonte. Do you think The silence of the lamb is about Evil? Or Psycho? Then watch Ffdm. El Indio enjoys his evil deeds. He is not driven by demons in his head or something; he has chosen for it. El Indio is the most frightening character I have ever seen in any opera, play or movie. The characters in Ffdm are more interesting - those in GBU are archetypical. So GBU raises some philosophical questions, Ffdm does not. The side characters in Ffdm are more developed: think of Cuccillo (Aldo Sambrell), Wild (Klaus Kinski) and Groggy (Luigi Pistilli). Also Leone makes full use of the triangular relation of El Indio, Cpt Mortimer and Monco, something he does not in GBU. But why should we care? A fist full of dollar clearly was a warming up - For a few dollars more and The good, the bad and the ugly both are extraordinary. Closer to perfection is hardly possible."
bkoganbing,"Jan 6, 2018",6/10,"With the success of A Fistful Of Dollars you knew a sequel had to be made and
Clint Eastwood left the small screen for good as Rawhide concluded its run and
he was back in Europe for another pasta western with Sergio Leone. Making
the trip with Eastwood was Lee Van Cleef and the two play a pair of bounty
hunters after the outlaw Gian Maria Volante and his gang of cutthroats. The
usual amount of bloody mayhem was dished out by Eastwood, Van Cleef and
the gang itself.The treat in this film is watching Eastwood and Van Cleef taking each other's measure and circling around each other like a pair of jungle cats
waiting to pounce on each other. It's one uneasy partnership.If you liked A Fistful Of Dollars you will most certainly like For A Few Dollars
More. This one solidified Clint Eastwood as a box office draw. As for Van Cleef he got out of supporting ranks and played if not out and out bad guys,
certainly rather sardonic good guys for the most part in the rest of his career.Another heaping helping of pasta."
Arbela-1,"Apr 5, 2007",10/10,"All three dollar films are great, but this one is special. The story which unfolds, the characters and story line. This has got to be the best of Sergios films. The theme throughout the film is haunting. The cinematography is superb. The only downside, is once you see this film, no other can live up to it and you always end up comparing to this one. I suppose thats when you go to the other two.Lee Van Cleef is most memorable as Mortimer, Valonte is more enigmatic than Ramon in a Fistfull and Eastwood has matured somewhat. There are so many memorable lines in the film. The character interplay is truly excellent. Mortimer ever so precise and thoughtful, Indio always calculating and in a rage and Manco always subtle. It is difficult to describe more without spoiling the film and plot. I guess the next best thing to do is to see it for yourself. If you are a Spaghetti Western Buff, then you must have already seen it. If you are not, then this will make you one.I have always wished a sequel to this great film was made, but then again maybe it just could not have ever lived up to it. A most enjoyable and excellent film."
Wuchakk,"Jun 8, 2017",6/10,"Released in 1965 and directed by Sergio Leone, ""For a Few Dollars More"" stars Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as two expert bounty hunters, the latter more experienced and sophisticated, who team-up to take down a notorious bank robber named El Indio, aka The Indian, played by Gian Maria Volontè.If you've seen several Spaghetti Westerns from the 60s-70s then you know that the ones by Leone are a notch or two above the other ones in overall quality, but I usually find his stories and the overall presentation kinda dull, albeit somewhat entrancing. Not to mention these early ones (""A Fistful of Dollars"" and this one) are hindered by laughable sound effects (like punches) and bad English dubbing. Then there's the incongruent mixing of seriousness with goofy humor, like when hats are shot off a dude's head without a scratch. Why Sure!""For a Few"" comes across as a dress rehearsal for the superior ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" which was made the next year. Like that one, there's no female character of any note and the overlong flick ends with an allegedly suspenseful gunfight between the three main characters. Speaking of which, Gian Maria Volontè is notably charismatic as El Indio.There's this myth going around that Leone's Dollars trilogy introduced the concept of the antihero, otherwise known as the ""good (or likable) bad man."" Actually, the antihero had been around for decades when ""Fistful"" was released in '64. Take, for example, John Wayne's Ringo Kid in ""Stagecoach"" (1939) or Richard Widmark's Comanche Todd in ""The Last Wagon"" (1956) or Anthony Quinn's Bob Kallen in ""The Ride Back"" (1957) and, particularly, Brando's Kid Rio in ""One-Eyed Jacks"" (1961). These are just off the top of my head.The difference with Eastwood's antihero in Leone's Man With No Name trilogy is that, unlike the antiheroes above, he is without personality, unless squinting, shooting and smoking cheroots are taken as profound marks of character. In Short, Leone introduced the antihero CARICATURE as opposed to the antihero CHARACTER. Cool caricatures work just fine when you're in your teens or early 20s, but after you mature a bit you naturally desire more three-dimensional and believable characters.The film runs 132 minutes and was shot in Granada, Almería & Colmenar Viejo, Spain, with interiors done in Rome. The plot of the screenplay (by Leone et al.) was taken from Kurosawa's samurai film ""Sanjuro.""GRADE: B-"
jgcorrea,"Nov 23, 2021",5/10,"The 1960s, with the end of censorship, the growing promiscuity in customs, and the fashion for rebellion à la protest marches marked the escalation of films made to endorse the action of murderers, to emphasize the killer bravado or generate a kind of joy in most hysterical deadly manifestations. The 1960s ended up inaugurating the so-called entertainment format of today...
Spaghetti western had something to do with it. It reversed the old West Outlaw-versus-Good guy formula. Dollari In Più wasn't quite as stylish as The Good, the Bad and the Ugly, but a significant step ahead of A Fistful of Dollars, with its excellent photography, its Morricone anthological soundtrack and its taciturn Clint."
Wulfstan10,"Oct 31, 2005",10/10,"This is, I think, the first of Leone's true masterpieces, and quite possibly Leone's most ""watchable"" film. A Fistful of Dollars is a great film: revolutionary, gritty, violent, and fun, and it certainly was the true beginning of a monumental change in westerns. However, this is the first film where Leone's brilliance fully comes to the front. On the other hand, while not quite as famous (in the English-speaking world) as the Good, the Bad, and the Ugly (GBU) and perhaps not quite as great a cinematic achievement as GBU or Once Upon a Time in the West (OUTIW), this film is nevertheless not far behind those clear masterpieces.The characteristic Leone visual style and incredible artistry are very powerful here. Although some of this is evident in small amounts in the previous film, here we really get to see the incredible, revolutionary close-ups and the contrast between close-ups and long shots. These and other images are powerful and beautiful. The film also brings the deliberate pacing and wonderful, almost unbearable, build-up of tension before quick action. Leone's sense of irony and brilliant weaving together of various motifs and symbols (particularly religious) also comes to the forefront in this film, as does the humour.The story is more complex than before, and more emotional and profound than GBU or OUTIW. Not until Duck, You Sucker! does Leone really delve more into emotions and psyches more than here, which gives this film an added depth and power.The scenes showing Indio's psyche, obsession, and mental decay are also powerful and perfect. Some (including Leone himself, apparently) feared that Volonte was overacting a tad, while others point out how the flashbacks are supposedly inaccurate portrayals of the effects of marijuana, however, this all works incredibly well. Volonte is quite convincing as a criminal sinking into a form of psychosis and obsessed with personal demons of the past and the flashbacks work brilliantly at hitting this theme home, creating an powerful, surreal, mournful, and lonely eeriness that, although it is not clear at first, perfectly parallels Mortimer's own despair and quest.The the way in which the story progresses, and brings the three main characters together, is brilliant. The introductions of the characters to how Mortimer and Manco focus on the same bandit (Indio), but with the reason for the interests rather subtly and vaguely indicated from the start, to how Mortimer and Manco ""duel"" before joining forces (sort of) is perfect.The music here, while similar to, and less famous than, the score for GBU, is also simply incredible. Just as this film reveals the first full flowering of Leone's gifts, it is also the first full flowering of Morricone's abilities and style introduced in the prior film. The score is in fact just as incredible as Morricone's subsequent ones and it excels at creating a sense of loneliness, despair, mournfulness, and eeriness in a way the even GBU doesn't and which fewof his other scores have. The only scores of his that I can think of which match or excell it on this point Once Upon a Time in America (at least with respect to despair, mourning, and loneliness), The Great Silence, OUTIW (but the harmonica music only) and The Untouchables (in despair and eeriness). This score thus perfectly conveys the atmosphere of the lonely, unpleasant towns, the lonely, harsh life of the bounty hunters, the harshness of the outlaws and Indio's increasingly crazed mind, and Mortimer's despair and personal quest.Finally, we for the first time get to see Lee van Cleef in a first role and he is simply outstanding. He handles the role so well, it's hard to imagine that he had nothing even approaching this magnitude before.This film really has no real faults, the only ones being a few technical errors such as the discrepancy in the wanted poster that Mortimer slides under the door near the beginning. However, these are tiny, most people won't notice, and no-one should really care about them. They are also problems that vanished in Leone's later films where he had more time and more money.In terms of length and pacing, this is also one of Leone's shorter, faster-paced films. Only a Fistful of Dollars and Duck, You Sucker! compare in those terms. This can be good, or bad, depending on the person, interests, or mood. Personally, Leone's longer masterpieces are my favourites, but sometimes even I don't have the time or patience to sit through their relatively slow development (and I am someone who can watch the 3.75-hour Once Upon A Time in America over and over) and want the quicker pace, action, and wit of this film. Also, certainly for some people this movie will be better suited on this point and those who find GBU or OUTIW to be a tad long should opt for this. It certainly is one of the two most lively and fun of Leone's films (the other being the longer GBU).On the whole, the combination of everything makes this a brilliant masterpiece and the pacing and development make the film extremely fun and fast-paced to watch. It is a clear masterpiece."
emperor_bender,"Jun 13, 2008",10/10,"Usually in the rules of the cinema world, sequels are inferior to originals. But not in the ""Dollars"" trilogy's case.For a Few Dollars More is what I believe a superior film to Fistful of Dollars. Fistul was good, but this movie was just better.Our hero, ""Monco"" (Clint Eastwood) is a bounty killer, living off the money he makes from bringing down the wanted. Soon enough, he comes across a big catch: the infamous ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volonte, who played Ramon Rojo in the previous film). However, this time Monco has a rival, another bounty killer with skills matching his. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Soon they must band together to take down El Indio and his gang before Indio gets them.Mortimer was a very interesting addition to the film I believe. He was cool, laid back, like the Man with No Name, only Mortimer was much more sophisticated. It was fun to watch him be like Monco only more fancy.Overall, this film is better than Fistful of Dollars. Fans of the first will find this a real treat.10/10"
Barry-73,"Feb 4, 2003",10/10,"This movie is tied with ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"", as my all-time favorite western. It's one of several masterpieces put forth by Sergio Leone. I love everything about it- the gorgeous cinematography, the fantastic musical score by Ennio Morricone, the acting, the script, and everything else. It's all top-notch. What more can I say about this movie? Clint Eastwood is of course fantastic, along with Lee Van Cleef, and Gian Maria Volonté who plays the main villain of the movie, El Indio. This movie has a lot of acting without words, lots of watching and waiting, which is typical Sergio Leone Style. There are periods where the camera focuses on the faces of the characters as they watch each other and try to figure out what the other is doing or try to be the first shot in the shootout scenes.This movie is best viewed with your VCR patched into your stereo system or a home theater system, to get the most out of Ennio Morricone's haunting score. And if you've got it on DVD, it would be that much better. Unfortunately this movie came out when I was only about 2 or 3, so I never saw it in the theater, but it must've really made an impression on those who did see it. Watching it on big-screen TV with the sound played through your stereo would be the next best thing. I highly recommend it and I give it a perfect 10 score. Go rent it, or better yet, by it!"
dfranzen70,"Jul 11, 2016",8/10,"Sergio Leone's For a Few Dollars More (1965, ***1/2) is, in theory, a sequel to A Fistful of Dollars, which was itself a big hit for the man and the studio. The bad news is that it's a sequel mostly in name, but the good (great) news is that it's every bit as deliciously violent and captivating as its predecessor.Clint Eastwood returns, although he's no longer The Man with No Name; he's Monco, a ""bounty killer"" – not a bounty hunter, because that might imply he intends to bring 'em back alive. Monco has his eyes on a desperado named Indio, played by Italian actor Gian Maria Volontè. Trouble is, another bounty killer, name of Colonel Mortimer (Lee van Cleef) also wants Indio. The fact that the man has a reward of $10,000 on his head probably figures into things a little. Add in the rest of the gang, and you're looking at maybe $27,000. Which today I assume would be $75 million. I don't know, you look it up.Mortimer and Monco do decide to team up; after all, we can't have too many bad guys. That doesn't mean that they won't try to double cross one another. The plan is for Monco to infiltrate Indio's band and get him to move north, toward the town of El Paso, where they'll attempt to rob the town's Fort-Knox-like bank. Oh, Indio goes north all right, with Monco, and the bank is hit, butwell, let's just say things don't go as planned for anyone.For a Few Dollars More is an epic, even though it's ""only"" 132 minutes long. I mean it's an epic in the same way that Lawrence of Arabia is an epic, with majestic, sweeping vistas followed by (in Leone's case) extreme closeups of the three leads. There are duels in the streets, just as you'd expect a western to have. For all I know, this happened all the time, and in this movie it happens repeatedly. Still, it's not as if every fight is carefully sanctioned, as there are plenty of ambushes to be found.This was the middle film in the series that really put the then-somewhat-young Eastwood on the map. Van Cleef's Mortimer calls him ""kid,"" and Eastwood's calls Mortimer ""old man""; in reality, the two were only five years apart in age. Eastwood, of course, is still kicking; he turned 86 a couple of months ago. Maybe his days as a taciturn gunslinger are long behind him, but he's still a creative genius. And he learned a lot of the directorial tricks of the trade from Leone himself, a master of the western genre. This, along with its series counterparts, is definitely not to be missed."
anchoreddown,"Mar 6, 2013",10/10,"The Man With No Name is back. Two bounty hunters at opposite ends of the scope. Both killing for money. When they both discover they're after the same man, they start a feuding over who will walk away with the money. At times it gets confusing when you get two thirds into the movie when everyone starts double-crossing each other, but otherwise, it's a great shoot-out of a western. There are several nice pieces of machinery seen in the film, not quite as fancy as those in the Sabata trilogy. Yes, there are a handful of obvious low budget shots, but it still holds up well as the middle piece of the trilogy. It may be the not as popular as the other two, but it's still Clint Eastwood at his best."
amesmonde,"Jun 9, 2025",N/A,"Two bounty hunters - the enigmatic Man With No Name (Clint Eastwood) and the vengeful Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) - cross paths while tracking the sadistic outlaw El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté). Initially at odds, they forge a wary alliance as the hunt spirals into a violent reckoning.Of the three films in Leone's Dollars Trilogy, For a Few Dollars More arguably boasts the strongest emotional narrative of his Spaghetti Westerns. Where Fistful was primal and The Good, the Bad and the Ugly sprawling, this entry finds perfect pacing and character interplay. Eastwood returns in fine form, but it's Lee Van Cleef's steely, vengeful Mortimer who provides the film's moral spine and one of the genre's finest performances.Volonté, this time as the deranged Indio, chews every sun-bleached frame, while Mario Brega and other Leone regulars return in new guises - a clever touch that lends the trilogy a strange, shifting mythic quality. Morricone's score is again magnificent, with the recurring musical watch motif providing one of cinema's most memorable audio cues.Leone's command of pace, widescreen compositions, and operatic violence is unmatched here, with costumes and set design evoking a lawless, surreal frontier. It's a film that lingers long after the final standoff.Overall, it remains the finest story of the three Spaghetti Western classics - expertly acted, perfectly paced, and driven by Morricone's unforgettable music."

AhmedSpielberg99,"Aug 16, 2019",9/10,"To consider this one of the rare sequels that improves upon their predecessors would be an understatement. With a taut screenplay, tight editing, impressive camera work, Superb cinematography with beautifully framed shots, Morricone's atmospheric and slow-burning score, a nuanced direction and an unmatched chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, one of the most intimidating villains in a Western, I wouldn't be exaggerating if I said that For a Few Dollars More is about on par with Leone's masterpiece The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The latter is still my favourite of his, but I really think For a Few Dollars More has a more daring, challenging and unpredictable script! The complaint I have is that the first act is a bit too cheesy unlike the rest of the film. Hence, there is kind of a jarring tonal shift between the first and the second act.(9/10)"
bensonmum2,"Jul 9, 2007",9/10,"Two bounty hunters are going after the same man - a crazed escaped convict named Indio (Gian Maria Volontè). Realizing that the job is too big for either one alone, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Clint Eastwood) decide to put their egos aside a team-up to get their man. But can these two men take on and take out an army of outlaws?A Fistful of Dollars may have come first and The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly may be the fanboy's choice, but my favorite movie in Sergio Leone's Dollar's Trilogy is For a Few Dollars More. In contrast to the first movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a more sophisticated, more confident film. Leone took the ideas he developed in A Fistful of Dollars and ran with them. There's definite growth in Leone as a director. Similarly, you can see growth in Eastwood and Morricone. All three - director, actor, and composer - were coming into their own with confidence to spare. And in comparison with the better known third movie in the trilogy, For a Few Dollars More is a tighter, more fluid film. It may be one of the best movies ever made, but The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly does tend to drag every now and then. That's not he case with For a Few Dollars More. There's not a wasted moment. But please, don't misinterpret anything I've written - I think all three movies are works of genius. I just happen to prefer For a Few Dollars More to the other two.Beyond Leone, Eastwood, and Morricone, any discussion of For a Few Dollars More wouldn't be complete without mentioning the rest of the cast and the sets.The Cast: Eastwood may be the more known commodity, but he often is upstaged in this movie by both Van Cleef and Volontè. In fact, Volontè steals most every scene in which he appears. His dope-smoking, homicidal Indio is one of the most ruthless and memorable characters I've seen in a Spaghetti Western. Another interesting casting decision is that of Klaus Kinski. His screen time may be limited, but his scenes with Van Cleef are among the most memorable in the movie. The rest of the cast, especially Mario Brega and Luigi Pistilli, are just as solid.The Sets: For a Few Dollars more looks like a million dollars thanks to some wonderful sets. Some of the villages found in and around Almeria, Spain, are incredible looking. It would be difficult to duplicate the authenticity of a place like Los Albaricoques with its cobbled streets and white-washed adobe buildings. Yet when called upon to do so, Carlo Simi designed and built some equally impressive sets. His attention to detail in the planning and set decoration is impressive."
Witchfinder-General-666,"Dec 10, 2006",10/10,"Sergio Leone's ""Per Qualche Dollaro In Più"" aka ""For A Few Dollars More"" of 1965, the ingenious second film of the Dollar Trilogy, is a brilliant and essential Saghetti Western milestone, that is only surpassed by Leone's two most brilliant masterpieces to follow, ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" and ""Once Upon A Time In The West"". ""For A Few Dollars More"" even outshines its brilliant predecessor ""A Fistful Of Dollars"", and deserves to be named as one of the greatest and most important Westerns ever made!Two bounty hunters, Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (aka. The Man With No Name, Clint Eastwood) are both trying to track down a vicious and sadistic outlaw, the villainous ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volontè). Sometimes working together, sometimes against each other, the two men strive for the same goal for different reasons.The acting in ""For A Few Dollars More"" is superb. Clind Eastwood plays the Man With No Name with perfection again. Lee Van Cleef is great as Col. Douglas Mortimer, a character who is equally cool, witty and clever as the Man With No Name. And Gian Maria Volontè's performance as El Indio is brilliant and diabolic, Volontè definitely knew how to lay stress on cruelty, evilness and insanity for a role. The supporting cast is not inferior in its brilliance, as it contains such great actors as Luigi Pistilli, Mario Brega, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli and the great Klaus Kinski, who plays a hunchbacked henchman of El Indio's.The cinematography is, once again, superb. The movie was shot in the beautiful Spanish Almeira, which was definitely the best location for Spaghetti Westerns to be made, Ennio Morricones brilliant score is not only great (Morricone is always great), it is one of his best compositions.A beautifully shot, brilliantly written and directed Spaghetti Western, ""Per Qualche Dollaro In Piu"" is a powerful, impressive and violent film. Out of the three Dollar movies, the character of the Man With No Name, who actually has the name (or alias) Monco in this, is the roughest in ""For A Few Dollars More"" and in many occasions, Lee Van Cleef's character Col. Mortimer is actually the more sympathetic of the two bounty hunters.Excelled only by its successor ""The Good, The Bad And The Ugly"" (which is arguably the greatest Western ever made), there is no doubt in my mind that ""For A Few Dollars More"" is one of the best Westerns ever made. A brilliant movie in all aspects, a must-see, not only for Spaghetti Western fans like myself, but for everyone. A brutal, powerful, stylish, witty and impressive stroke of genius, ""For A Few Dollars More"" is a movie that is, in one word, perfection. 10/10"
Dello_,"Sep 5, 2019",9/10,"""For a few dollars more"" is one of the great spaghetti western by Sergio Leone. The film is a bit slow for today standards but it doesn't care because it is highly entertaining and satisfying at the end. Indeed the slowest parts of the movie are the Sergio Leone's close-ups on the characters' face expressions, which thanks to an excellent cast create characterization and convey emotional tension. This is particularly true for the gun duels where the eyes of the characters study each other at the point where the viewers can almost feel the soul of the challengers. And in this duels there is a great expedient: the two gunfighters have to shot when the music from a pocket watch stops and this simple element gives freedom to the great Ennio Morricone to shine. The score is indeed fantastic and highly memorable with some few themes that will be impressed in the mind even after the end of the movie. As I said all the cast was exceptional but I have to give a special mention to Lee Van Cleef who portrays the colonel Douglas Mortimer, whose character form an alliance with Monco (Clint Eastwood) to take down El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè), that I felt stole every scene he's in.
""For a few dollars more"" isn't a movie about moral messages but it doesn't pretend to be neither. Its only scope is to entertain and it's freaking good in this task, a very great movie!"
Steffi_P,"Mar 6, 2007",9/10,"death sometimes had its price. After the success of the groundbreaking Fistful of Dollars, Sergio Leone returned with his second instalment in the dollars trilogy. The scale was bigger, the style was bolder, and the moral standards were lower.The title itself works on many levels. The films budget was of course somewhat more than the cheaply made Fistful. On top of that everything is pushed just a little further in this picture. Whereas Fistful was just set in one town, we now travel all over the old west, and for the first time we see those incredible landscape shots that Leone did so well. The direction and storytelling is much more confident. There is a fairly bizarre level of stylisation, with huge facial close-ups, fast paced editing and long-drawn out stand-offs.Many viewers talk of Leone's debt to classic Hollywood westerns, as well as the films of Akira Kurosawa, but while these are part of the mix his style really reminds me of nothing more than Sergei Eisenstein at his most flamboyant. Think about those fast edits between Mortimer's face and Indio's poster, or the series of close-ups during each build up to a gunfight, then look at Eisenstein's Strike or October and you'll see what I mean. Those films must have been a massive influence on Leone, although it's rarely acknowledged.Each of the three main characters gets their own lengthy introductory scene which take up nearly a full half hour before the story really gets underway. We open with Mortimer, his head buried in a bible. Given the way he acts afterwards  forcing the train to stop, intimidating people and coldly and calmly killing an outlaw  this is an example of the rather ambiguous attitude Leone takes towards religion throughout this and his other pictures. Manco first appears in a thunderstorm. Indio's first scene is gloomy and sinister. All three men are established as killers. Nearly all the characters are after one thing  money. It's not just the bandits and bounty hunters. Even the boy who holds Manco's horse is always after another dollar. I say nearly all the characters  there is of course one goal more important in the spaghetti western than money, and that is vengeance.For a Few Dollars more isn't just bigger in every way, it's also better in that it is more professional, particularly the acting. Clint Eastwood had by now gained more confidence, and had perfected his slow, silent, moody persona that would become his trademark. There are plenty of great supporting parts, and the dubbing of Italian actors is pretty seamless. However the real jewel in the crown was the rediscovery of Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef had made a career of bit parts in Hollywood westerns, usually as a mean-looking outlaw. Leone cast him as the most heroic and honest of the three main characters. Perhaps a touch of irony was intended, but the truth is Van Cleef turned out to be a great actor (I'm always particularly struck by the very genuinely emotional look on his face when he realises Manco has taken his watch), and ideally suited to playing the good guy for a change. Having retired once in Hollywood, he eventually enjoyed a second career as one of the most prominent leading men in the spaghetti western genre.Of course, the mix of Leone's films wouldn't be complete without the music of Ennio Morricone, and here for the first time director and composer are truly in synch. Morricone is truly Leone's musical equivalent. Just like Leone's shooting style, Morricone's music isn't afraid to draw attention to itself. In this era a good film score was supposed to be one you didn't notice, but Morricone does the opposite. It is weird, wonderful and very listenable in its own right. The music in For a Few Dollars more is also matched up to the action in a way that hadn't happened since the days of silent cinema. Each character gets their own little musical motif  Mortimer has the Jewish harp twangs, Manco the bouncy flute melody and Indio the ominous bells. It's not a background score  it's excessive musical punctuation for Leone's style. In that first great duel in the church between Indio and the man who turned him in, when you hear that eerie little pocket watch tune, and then the organ crashes in with a rip-off of Bach's Toccata  then you know you're in the Leone zone!"
de_niro_2001,"Jan 11, 2001",N/A,"All three of the films in the Dollars trilogy are excellent and this is the best of an outstanding lot. The title sequences with an incredible Morricone score stick in your mind. The music in certain sequences sticks in your mind, such as ""La Resa Di Conti"" where Indio confronts Tomaso in the old church (it's unusual the use of an organ in music for a western). The music where Colonel Douglas Mortimer strikes a match off the Hunchback's braces is very similar to the music Morricone wrote for ""The Untouchables"" apart from the twangs on the Jew's harp. It is used for a few other scenes with the Hunchback such as outside the El Paso bank and the confrontation with Colonel Mortimer in the taberna in Agua Caliente. The music is faintly reminiscent of Mussorgsky's ""The Gnome"" from ""Pictures at an Exhibition"". Apart from the music another reason I like the film is the scenery. Some of the mountains in a few scenes are reminiscent of Scotland. There are a few Scottish mountains bear a likeness to the Spanish mountains seen behind Manco. An absolutely unique western, better than many American ones."

I like that nifty future gun that other guy constructs.It's been a while but it's easy to remember some competitive shoe crushing and some hat shooting.It's as good or better as the previous one.One likes the sordidness of its landscape and the attention to detail to immerse you in this folklorically violent world.I could not tell you the plot or quote more than one piece of dialogue but maybe I just owe this a rewatch.
tonypeacock-1,"Feb 23, 2023",10/10,"The gritty 'spaghetti' western genre introduced to Hollywood audiences with A Fistful Of Dollars continues with an even better film a year or so later. Clint Eastwood returns in a kind of 'man with no name' character although that is perhaps a misnomer as he has a name Monco.Here the story centres around deadly bounty hunters purring like cats at reward posters for murderers and robbers wanted dead or alive with handsome rewards on offer. The screenplay is very clever and features a web of double crossing, partnerships and crime. The film benefits from a bigger budget than its predecessor it seems which may have allowed the good casting of Lee Van Cleef as a fellow bounty hunter that is an older version of Monco. Deadly with the gun and equal in thirst for rewards.The music score by Ennio Morricone is a joy. I would rate him alongside the likes of John Barry and John Williams. I can't praise the film enough. This sub genre has certainly reinvigorated my love of western films."
Philipp_Flersheim,"Feb 6, 2022",5/10,"'For a Fistful of Dollars' was so innovative that Sergio Leone failed to top it with his next outing to the wild west. Here, two bounty hunters team up (though their alliance remains shaky) to hunt down a gang of bank robbers. There is the expected double crossing not only on their side but also on that of the gang, whose leader (played by Gian Maria Volontè) tries to use the bounty hunters in order to get rid of his colleagues (he does not want to share the booty). 'For a Few Dollars More' does have some of the elements that made 'For a Fistful of Dollars' interesting: the great music and the blurring of the distinction between hero and villain, for example. It also (and that's a downside) gives violence the same kind of esthetic appeal. Van Cleef is menacing but has a soft spot; Clint Eastwood is taciturn - with no soft spot. Volontè is brutal. Klaus Kinsky (one of the robbers) has perfected his trick of looking like a maniac. In short, it is all pretty generic and no longer original. Add to that the constant violence, and the whole film quickly gets repetitive and boring. It beats me why it is being rated so highly."
drqshadow-reviews,"Aug 22, 2011",9/10,"The most complete and spectacular of Leone's westerns, this really boils down to the once in a lifetime performances of Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef. As world-class bounty hunters chasing the same contract, the two agree to an uneasy truce before turning every trick in the book to double-cross and one-up each other. It's an unrelenting barrage of stern-faced masculinity, bravado and marksmanship, with filthy hired hands perfectly willing to trade bullets around every other corner. As with each of the director's dust-soaked pictures, this film covers for its small budget with an excess of personality and buckets of atmosphere, which results in a tougher, bolder, more genuine take than the most expensive Hollywood blockbusters of today. The infamous showdown with a truly despicable set of bounties may be what sends this picture riding off into the sunset, but it's a quieter scene earlier in the story that's always stuck with me: two grizzled old hunters trying to impress one other with nothing more than an empty street, a set of pistols and a pair of bullet-riddled hats."
RM851222,"Mar 1, 2015",8/10,"Greetings from Lithuania.""For a Few Dollars More"" (1965) is a really good old western. Made by Sergio Leone this is a spaghetti western so if you have seen some other his movies, you know what you are getting into. The story is kinda simple (as usual for these kind of movies) where two bounty hunters team up to catch the fish of their lives type bandit. And basically that's it.I like Sergio Leone movies for the same reasons i liked ""For a Few Dollars More"". They are specifically performed (you won't find this acting in ""Unforgiven"" for example), the set design is always something to look at - there are many details in the backgrounds which helps to create this real place and time and transport you to it. Cinematography is gorgeous. The music is always good, adventurous. The gunfights are OK, these movies again are not ""Unforgiven"" type gritty reality, they are ""fun Westerns"" and i like when they for example can shoot the very cigar- end with a revolver - a trick which in reality probably would end up with dudes half of face being blown up.Overall, if you like this stuff, you will like ""For a Few Dollars More"". Being the second installment in ""Dollars"" trilogy, it's not as good and epic as the ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly,"" but it's a very fine genre picture."
Kysugo,"Mar 1, 2024",8/10,"A Few Dollars More is more stylized, bigger budgeted and has a more layered and expanse story than Fistful. It builds upon the amazing spaghetti western that started it all. Quite a striking opening. I wonder if the guy had to stay there for the duration of the entire opening credits lol. The cinematography is noticeably better in this one than in Fistful. The shots in this movie are more cinematic and better thought out. There's some shots of the scenery/landscapes with the sun setting in the background that are gorgeous. It seems like they had a bigger budget to work with. More cameras and better ones to get cooler shots. You can tell Sergio was honing in on his style more clearly and precisely in this one. The music continues to be great and builds upon what was already composed for Fistful. I especially liked the locket theme and the way they implemented it during the climatic gun fight scene at the end.I love how the movie starts with Lee Van Cleef's character instead of Eastwood's character. It immediately makes you interested in Lee's character. He has such an alluring presence that demands your attention. I almost thought he was going to be the only main character for a second. Eastwood continues to be his effortlessly cool and badass self. Lee's character brings a more grounded approach with more of a human and relatable personality. Even though they got the same actor that played Ramon in the first one, he looks different. The character he plays is a bit different as well. He's a more maniacal, evil and vile person. His backstory was pretty good. They even got the same guy who played Chico in the first one. But with him they didn't even change his look, just his name.That scene with the landlady and husband at the hotel was great - wasn't expecting that clever bit of humor. Wow, Klaus Kinski used to be pretty handsome at one point. Using the old abandoned church as the criminals hideout was a really cool touch. I love how the old man who made coffins is back. Now he plays a prophet who hates trains. Not as much of a memorable or impactful character as in Fistful, but still nice to see him return for this movie. The dynamic and friendly rivalry between Lee and Eastwood's characters is fantastic, it's pretty much what drives the movie. That was so weird how Clint's face was covered in black paint for a split second then goes back to normal and there's no rhyme or reason why.One thing I noticed about this movie is that the pacing wasn't as tight as the first one. It tends to drag at times whereas Fistful always felt like it was moving at a constant forward speed. I feel like the way the story was told in Fistful was better. It was more engaging, interesting and fun. The storytelling didn't really grab me in this one. Even though the story is more layered and has more twists/turns in this one, it feels like it takes longer for them to get to the point in this one. It also felt like they didn't develop the characters as well, I felt more invested with the characters in Fistful. This is a longer movie yet it felt like they didn't use the time wisely to get me to care enough. They should have spent more time giving the characters depth, personality, quirks and backstory. It's probably a hot take and weird to say, but I liked Fistful more. Lee Van Cleef was a highlight as well, bringing a lot of personality and intrigue to the mix. For a Few Dollars More builds on the things that Fistful created but doesn't do them as well, namely in the presentation and pacing. I think that just because a movie has a bigger budget, is more stylized, has more characters, and is more expanse, doesn't mean it's better. It was good but I don't feel that inclined to watch it again. The only reason I'd watch it again is to make sure that I didn't like it as much as Fistful lol. Regardless, I can recommend this movie for sure, especially if your watching the Dollars trilogy."
rgpaeplrp,"Jul 31, 2025",9/10,"So I just rewatched For a Few Dollars More, and it holds up well. It's the second movie in Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy, and you can tell right away it's a step up from A Fistful of Dollars. The pacing is tighter, the story has more layers, and it just feels more polished overall. Clint Eastwood is classic Clint - quiet, cool - but Lee Van Cleef kills it in this one. His character, Mortimer, brings a whole new energy. Way more calculated and intense. You start off thinking he's just another bounty hunter, but there's this personal revenge angle that makes his story way more compelling. The villain, El Indio (played by Gian Maria Volonté), is crazy - not just evil for the sake of it, but messed up in the head. He's got this little musical pocket watch that plays during gunfights and flashbacks, and it somehow makes everything ten times more intense. Ennio Morricone's score in this one is genius. The music is the tension. It's peak Leone. Long, drawn-out standoffs, extreme close-ups, and those wide desert shots - it's all so stylized, but it works. That final duel scene? Chef's kiss. If you're into Westerns or just want to see where modern action films got a lot of their DNA, this one's a must. Still gritty, still cool, and way deeper than it first lets on. Solid 9/10 for me. Not just a great Western - just a great movie, period."
ccthemovieman-1,"Aug 31, 2011",N/A,"As with the first of these ""Man With No Name"" trilogies, I was pleasantly surprised how good these ""spaghetti western"" films were; better than I had remembered.Both Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are the English-speaking starring actors in this action-packed oater. Both play bounty hunters; both are tough, smart and great with a gun.The strategy between the two of them - when they join forces - is interesting, and you get the feeling neither one of them trusts the other, so it almost has a film noir-feel to it.Some people think this was the best of the three films. I wouldn't have a problem with that."
fh147,"Feb 3, 2025",6/10,"The second movie in the dollar trilogy, you can feel the Director become more confident with directing, And now with another great actor Lee Van Cleef to use and make every scene more cool, suspenseful, just laid back badass.In this movie, it's the Old fox That feel more like the main character seeing him using detective work and trying to outsmart and out think every person, it's so intriguing. Then we have the young more impulsive but still smart a Blondie.I still think the best bit of direction in the movie is how they use music to just make everything feel more moving, more whole, more interesting.To remove the Music is to remove the soul.The movie is a bit slow, but it's in the cowboy movie way where we have some long shots to make things more intense. But the cinematography is so alive. It doesn't feel old and dusty. There is enough cuts to make it feel dynamic.It really adds something to the film that it was done in a really hot and dirty place, all the actors look sweaty and like dirt is painted to the faces.It is the weakest in the dollar trilogy. It feels too long for the story, the first movie was 99 minutes and felt perfect, this is 132 The pacing is too dragging out and the villain is not that interesting and too much time is used on him.The films dynamic between the Old fox and young blondie is the best part of it, but it's the weakest in the trilogy."
afonsobritofalves,"Sep 12, 2018",9/10,"Without a doubt, one of the best Westerns ever. Of course it's not the best film by Sergeo Leone or Clint Weatwood, but it's still really good. Highly recommend."
JamesHitchcock,"Mar 20, 2010",7/10,"""For a Few Dollars More"" is the second part of Sergio Leone's ""Dollars"" trilogy, the films which made an international star of Clint Eastwood and introduced American audiences to the concept of the ""spaghetti western"". As in the other two instalments, Eastwood portrays the ""Man with No Name"", a mysterious gunman distinguished by his brown poncho, cigar and stubbly beard, more mercenary morally ambiguous than the traditional Western hero. In this episode the Man with No Name is a bounty hunter in pursuit of a ruthless bandit known as ""El Indio"".The film also introduced a second iconic Western star, Lee Van Cleef. Van Cleef was five years older than Eastwood, but his career had stalled after he was injured in a serious car accident in 1958. Here he plays character known as the ""Man in Black"", who is also in pursuit of El Indio. Like Eastwood's character, Van Cleef's is calm, deliberate and laconic and a lethal gunfighter. In other respects, however, the two men are very different. For a start, the Man in Black has a name and a past. We learn that his name is Colonel Douglas Mortimer and that he was originally a Southern gentleman from the Carolinas. In keeping with his gentlemanly status he is always smartly dressed in a black suit. He seems to be a bounty hunter- early in the film we see him killing an outlaw named Guy Calloway for the bounty of $1000- but towards the end we learn that he may have other, personal, reasons for wanting El Indio dead.Of the first two instalments of the trilogy I prefer ""For a Few Dollars More"" to ""A Fistful of Dollars"". (I have not seen ""The Good, The Bad and The Ugly"" for many years, so I will wait until I have seen it again before I decide which of the three is my favourite). Despite being very influential when it came out, the first film can seem today like little more than a run-of-the-mill Western. ""For a Few Dollars More"" is more than that. There are some effective touches, such as the strange quasi-duel where Mortimer shows off his skill with a gun by shooting at the ""Man with No Name""'s hat, and the recurring motif of a musical pocket watch. (El Indio has such a watch that he plays before engaging in duels). Leone makes effective use of the contrasting styles of his two heroes- I call them that, despite their apparent amorality, because we are clearly intended to root for them against the brutal sadism of El Indio and his gang- and handles the action well, leading up to an enthralling climax. (The action in ""A Fistful of Dollars"", by contrast, can sometimes be confusing). Overall this is a cool, stylish Western. 7/10"
moonspinner55,"Jul 29, 2006",4/10,"Sergio Leone's second installment in his spaghetti-western trilogy with lead actor Clint Eastwood (following 1964's ""A Fistful of Dollars"" and in turn followed by 1966's ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly""). Bounty hunter Clint spars with gunslinger Lee Van Cleef amidst a great many dirt-town and saloon shoot-outs. Sweaty atmospherics, some exciting sequences (including a terrific finish), but Leone's pacing is unbelievably dogged. Although the films in this canon have a tricky kind of symbolism which underline the finished product with a bracing, immediate quality that can be quite gripping for an audience, they are not deep-thinkers, and after the first hour it becomes blurry with noisy violence. ** from ****"
johnnyboyz,"Aug 26, 2010",9/10,"Twelve months prior to the release of Leone's 1966 opus The Good, the Bad and the Ugly saw the second of his three ""Dollars"" films in For a Few Dollars More, nicely wedging itself in between said supposed prequel and 1964's A Fistful of Dollars. The films get progressively better, with the first a loose remake of something else about a loner wading into a town; beating up the Mexican bandits and then attempting to rescue a damsel, a wonderful film on its own but now more a fascinating example of Leone as he found his directorial feet. Seeing the 'trilogy' as a whole, The Good, the Bad and the Ugly is a culmination of Leone's sublime ability to work within an established western setting but implement similar plot ideas and a stark, episodic directorial style as he makes every sequence and scene his own as this sordid tale of mostly unpleasant people weaves their way to a bloody, confrontational climax.Like the subsequent 1966 film; For a Few Dollars More sees a lead, supposedly the same in all three, played by Clint Eastwood forge an uneasy alliance with another man as they seek out a grand prize; a prize they could split between them or steal for themselves from the other. The films share more with one another than just the style implemented by the director; here, Eastwood's character Monco teams up with Lee Van Cleef's army Colonol Douglas Mortimer as they chase down a Mexican bandit named El Indio (Volonté). Both films see these forged partnerships ultimately fighting a ruthless killing machine, a sadistic man whom enjoys the pain he and others inflict on people and nary batters an eyelid in following through with his actions when faced with the idea of cutting a family in two by way of killing some of its members; particularly aiding in having the two central players come across as more favourable than they actually are. The relations the characters share are in binary opposition to its 1966 cousin; there, an American with links to the army was perceived as the chief threat to both Eastwood's character and his ally, a Mexican bandit he teams up with named Tuco. Here, the bandit is the enemy and the army personnel the ally. One thing remains, that each of the two films are breathtaking in their imagery and direction as they weave a dramatic and involving path, leading us through a hostile perception of the old west to a form of satisfying closure effortlessly tying up various strands.We begin with a straight comparison between the pairing which will come top forge the path the film's story will take. Van Cleef, clad in black and with that ominous expression, sits on a train and gets off at a station of his choice after illegally activating the emergency stop. People he interacts with seem scared on him, a barking train guard stopping dead in his tracks when he sees it's Colonol Mortimer leading his horse off the train and into town. He's a bounty hunter, and goes after a criminal who is wanted by the law; this bandit occupies the same area his wanted posters litter, suggesting an overly confident; unhinged, almost sociopathic, persona-come-attitude in that he's in such close proximity to the zone he's wanted by the local law. When the Colonol, carrying an array of rifles and guns we feel he cannot wait to use, takes him on and beats him with relative ease the ability and temperament of the man is finely established. On another strand is Monco who's also a bounty hunter, his chosen target is playing cards in a tavern and a methodical approach from the man sees him breeze in up to the game and engage in a cheeky card turning trick which provokes his target; Monco only turning when provoked to murderous brute force in which degrees of hard bodiedness are required.The two of them share an uneasy relationship, initially. A scene in a room the two of them occupy sees each of the men uneasily shift around discussing their alliance, each of them swapping positions of being seated as the other looms over them whilst still standing; suggesting a state of oneupmanship in which both are evenly matched and exchanging positions of power. Eventually, they seem to share some common ground through dialogue and both of them seat themselves down opposite one another suggesting a now agreed relationship. Leone highlights this in a physical sense with an surreal hat shooting contest, something perhaps not entirely necessarily given what plays out in the aforementioned scene. The gun-toting, gang sporting, child harming, family killing Mexican terrorist named El Indio is their target; someone with a bounty on their head's after having been broken out of jail by his gang early on, whom then all take refuge in a church so as to lay low and plan a bank heist. The locale of the church and Leone's placing of El Indio at one point in a pulpit suggests a sense of hierarchy within his own circles, with an additional a sense of them following him as he leads the sermon.Leone's ability to provide us with Mortimer and paint an image of him through other people's reactions and his own interactions with things around him before bringing it all round and humanising him with a back story is wonderful. One other sequence greatly subscribes to a certain theory pioneered by Hitchcock, about men sitting at a table with a bomb underneath it; in that a wall of a bank set to blow is teasingly shot with an array of long-shots of the building, close ups of an unsuspecting guard inside and face of the bounty hunters, all accompanied with distorted and uncharacteristic sound effects and music as we are denied what is expected to happen. Through the trilogy, Leone cemented a directorial legacy; through For a Few Dollars More, Leone makes the marvellous look effortless."
lost-in-limbo,"May 30, 2010",10/10,"The second instalment of Sergio Leone's dollar trilogy ""For A Few Dollars More"" happens to be my favourite of the three, and that of the Spaghetti western genre. However at first it wasn't the case, as I did prefer the sweeping milestone ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" and the pioneering ""A Fistful of Dollars"" but over time from the first time I saw it (and it was the first one I saw of the three) until now I've really grown fond of the follow-up to put it up there above the rest.A squinting Clint Eastwood would return to his trademark role that got him noticed as the lone bounty hunter with the poncho and chewed up cigar ""The man with no name"" -- although he's known as Monco here, along with Gian Maria Volonte in another principle villain roll Indio -- a dope smoking, but venomous bandit with a cackling laugh. Joining them is bad-ass actor Lee Van Cleef as an opposing bounty hunter Colonel Mortimer with a hidden agenda. Van Cleef emit's a steely mood, which works off Eastwood's laconic presence that's even more inscrutable. Both want Indio --- who'll get him first and that means eliminating each other for that prize. So they come to the option of teaming up to see Indio and his outlaws' dead or alive. Leone really does focus on the impetuously odd relationship that forms between these two central characters and the dialogues exchanged (while quite sparse and to the point) shows the growing admiration in what they can see they're quite alike. So when Volonte's flamboyant character finally comes to the party and the three separate paths come to one. It does make for one memorable climax with Ennio Morricone's musical score packing an emotional punch, where all three separate instinctive music themes for the characters seem merge into one and the story's themes open up. Something about this effort feels more personal with its characteristics lending a hearty vibe to its brutal lashings.Leone's novel emphasis is on the dramatic visuals effectively told through brash editing and elastic cinematography that perfectly framed a violent breed of western that was complemented by its harsh dry locations painting a local décor flavour and rich colour tone. On this aspect alone, he spawned a genre. The soap opera story has more scope than the previous outing, in what is more a brazen character journey piece with what starts off as a waiting game that enters conniving turns and lighting-quick standoffs while following two anti-heroes in what is everyman looking after themselves. While not as compact and lean as the first, its inflated nature doesn't make it feel any longer and Leone's material is instrumentally harrowing. The starch, but slight script consists of a wry sense of humour and customary biting exchanges. Morricone's soaring music is excitingly cued, but also the sound effects of the gun crackling and bullets whistling are jarringly pitched.Klaus Kinski also shows up, and is rather distinguishable with a hunchback as one of the hot-tempered outlaws with a malicious glee in his eyes and Luigi Pistilli as well plays a gang members too.Leone's ""For A Few Dollars More"" is an ambitious, stirring and flashy Italian spaghetti western entertainment."
jglillis-1,"Mar 23, 2008",8/10,"In this ""Man With No Name"" movie, Eastwood's character is identified by the sheriff who pays Van Cleef his bounty money as ""Manco"" - or ""sleeve"" in Spanish.Note that when Eastwood goes into the tavern after Baby Cavanaugh, he does all his fisticuffs with his left hand only, leaving his gun hand, the right hand, always free. He even deals the draw poker hand entirely with his left hand. This is probably how he got his nickname of ""sleeve."" (In French, ""La Manche,"" or ""sleeve"" is the English Channel.)IMHO, this is the best of the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy. The scene following the macho confrontation in the dark street, observed by the three muchachos from under the boardwalk, is classic, even though the third reason somehow never gets brought up. Van Cleef is an underrated actor and is at least as good as Eastwood (IMHO) in this film.""Let's drink to this partnership - with no tricks."""
tomimt,"Aug 11, 2010",8/10,"You could think, that a story about two bounty hunters after a same criminal would be rather straight forwarded tale about men, who do anything to get money. And in a sense you'd be right, but at the same time you'd be wrong.Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) is a no nonsense kind of a man, who is killing criminals in order to get money. So is Monco (Clint Eastwood). Mortimer is older and more experienced, Monco is younger and more reckless. And they both have a same goal, but also a different purpose to aim to that goal. The more moral victory of the story goes to Mortimer, despite they both do their fair amount of smacking the arses of ruthless men of psychotic murderer El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté).The main cast does remarkable job. Especially Volente manages to create truly loathsome villain, who isn't afraid to get really dirty in order to get what he wants. Out of the heroes Lee Van Cleef manages to outshine Eastwood in this one, though Clint does manage to keep his own as well. The supporting cast is also well thought of, including famous German trouble maker Klaus Kinski.All the Leone western trademarks are fully present, including Morricones fabulous music and the long, well drawn gun duels. There's probably a bit more humour in the mix than in the The Good, The Bad and The Ugly, though none of the Leones movies are with out his a bit dark sense of humour.All in all, For A Few Dollars More will always be among my favourite westerns."
SeriousJest,"Mar 11, 2012",7/10,"I enjoyed the swagger of A Fistful of Dollars, but had some reservations about the quality of its script. This second installment in the ""Dollars Trilogy"" thematic series had all the swagger of Fistful, including awesome music and sick camera work, but also improved in the quality of script. It seemed that this story was more thought out, including plot twists and better character development, whereas Fistful's story appeared to be put in place merely to set up cool tag lines and posturing between Eastwood and Volonté. There was pretty heavy action in this second film, too: the total kill count was 30.Eastwood continued to show the world why he would eventually be regarded as one of the baddest mofos to ever grace the silver screen. Volonté was crazier and more ruthless in this film than he was in the first, and I loved it! Last but not least, Van Cleef may have stolen the show as the man in black, veteran bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimerit wasn't clear who the bigger badass was. In fact, Van Cleef claimed to be faster on the draw than Eastwood. He only took three frames of film (one eighth of a second) to draw, cock and fire! All in all, this film is a classic, and a great representative of what the spaghetti Western has to offer. About midway through, the pace dramatically slowed to an almost boring pace (although my perception may have been a bit clouded by beer-induced sleepiness), but it soon picked back up again, and the movie ended very strongly. I recommend that you set aside some time to watch this flick at some point, preferably with some alcohol and a friend that enjoys spaghetti Westerns, B movies, or campy films. I can't wait to see The Good, the Bad and the Ugly.For more reviews and a kickass podcast, check out www.livemancave.com"
itamarscomix,"Sep 26, 2011",8/10,"Sergio Lenoe's 'Man With No Man' trilogy is probably the only film series in history that only got better from one to the next; 'For a Few Dollars More' is better than 'A Fistful of Dollars', but not as great as the classic third installment. That's enough to make it a major classic, and it's indeed one of the best westerns ever made; Eastwood is at his very best, and Lee Van Cleef is fantastic as well.Artistically, it's a transitional piece; the music and cinematography took a huge bound forward from the first movie. And while it still doesn't make for scenes as timeless and unforgettable as the ones in the third installment, it's still one of the most grittily beautiful films of its time. An essential piece of cinema history."
kinky_friedman,"Jun 22, 2006",7/10,"The film has some great characters and a great idea, but there is so much going against it.First bad thing about the film: the editing. I can't name every single example, but there is one scene in particular in the beginning (the saloon scene, if you've scene it) where Clint gets off his horse and is crouched, and the next shot he is upright. Then, during a fistfight, he throws punches three feet away from his victim.Second bad thing about the film: unrealistic violence. First of all, nobody bleeds. One Mexican bleeds at the end, that's about it. Secondly, I know Mortimer and TMWNN are the best shots in the west, but in one scene Mortimer blindly shoots at someone and barely clips him in the neck, as a warning shot. I thought it was cool when I saw it, but in retrospect, it's cheesy.Third bad thing about this film: the dialog. It's just too unrealistic. It's entertaining, however, in a campy way. For example, listen to Clint Eastwood's quote: ""Tell me, isn't sheriff supposed to be courageous, loyal and, above all, honest?"" It made me smile, but cringe at the same time.The rest of the film is great. There is great Western-looking sets. The characters are great and interesting, and the plot has many twists to it, so it keeps you intrigued.Overall, I give this film a B."
tptensToadykingPiaCatDogSnailAnt,"Jun 6, 2020",1/10,"There is a bug without a leg trying to move around as the main villain Indio watches toward the end. This is an error in judgement by the filmmaker basically and I know what you could think, it is just a bug and they are eaten by others in the animal kingdom, except that is up for the animal kingdom which has their own rules and that is not in our power that is theirs. Or there are bug zapper/fly paper at stores just to get rid of them except that is for utility purposes in homes/yards, not something that is for entertainment in a movie. Does this sound crazy well this conscience is just the ticket. I don't really need to see that. I reminisce going to a theme park (Knotts Berry Farm I'm sure, if not then Disneyland) where there was a house there with all sorts of bugs that they would put on your hand and it would crawl around, I thought that was interesting. As for this movie, I used to like the Dollars trilogy(didnt care for the Once Upon movies) but now this movie is exempt for me, and by association the rest of the trilogy, oh well. That's that."
gigan-92,"Jan 23, 2012",10/10,"A+One of my favorite movies of all time, another Sergio Leone masterpiece. Clint Eastwood, called Manco (Portuguese for 'lame-handed'. Italian equivalent would be Monco) This time around, and once again the portrayal of the anti-hero is iconic. However, even he meets his match with Lee Van Cleef, playing Colonel Douglas Mortimer. I know fans probably debate this all the time, but it was clearly established in that first meet scene that Mortimer is the better shot. Not to undermine Eastwood, after all the two working together produce quite a body count in the usual bad-ass fashion. My favorite Leone villain would undoubtedly be Indio, played masterfully by Gian Maria Volonté. He's undeniably a killer, a conniving schemer, and yes even a madman perhaps but he's also distraught permanently by what he's done. Or rather one crime in particular, but I won't spoil it.It was my first Spaghetti Western as a matter of fact. I stumbled upon it on TV, right about the scene where Indio extracts revenge on the man who betrayed him. It's quite possibly my favorite scene in the whole movie. The numerous wide-angle shots, the glorious close-ups, and the thrill of Ennio Morricone's score, they all come together to create unrivaled tension. Of all things, an organ plays a tune that could belong to a horror film, but it fits so perfectly. As a boy of eight I was completely mesmerized by the scene.The cinematography is quite well done, always lingering on an object to add dimension or meaning. Note how when Eastwood's character stares at the wanted poster for Indio, his eyes linger on the money. When Mortimer looks at the same poster, the camera cuts back and forth between his eyes and that piece of paper, the sound of gunshots add to the scene awesomely. Cleverly, Leone is building up that there's more than money driving Cleef's character. And of course the sets are awesome, and for being filmed in Europe, one would never guess that it's anything but the American West itself.The film boasts incredible cinematography, a thrilling score and bad-ass characters. I reiterate that this is one of the best movies ever made, and I hold to it."
Pjtaylor-96-138044,"Feb 19, 2018",8/10,"Set to the tune of what is, for my money, the best musical score of the three 'Man With No Name' pictures and perhaps my favourite western score of all time, this larger-scale sequel is an improvement on the first mainly in terms of its plotting. 'For A Few Dollars More (1965)' casts Eastwood's nameless stranger - who's introductory sequence is one of the best in cinema history - as a dangerous but reckless bounty killer, pairing him with Lee Van Cleef's methodical and sophisticated Colonel as they aim to take down a well-known criminal and pocket the large reward. Van Cleef has a more personal stake in the action whereas Eastwood's in it for the cash and this juxtaposition wisely adds variety to the already well established formula as their uneasy partnership is never as straightforward as it may seem. Along the way we get the blistering confrontations and cool cigar-chewing banter we'd expect from a picture of this calibre. Those stare-downs are just as good as ever and, while there's nothing here quite as intense as the final showdown from the trilogy's first instalment, the feature as a whole is just a lot more fun. 8/10"
slokes,"Apr 24, 2004",8/10,"The middle section and niftiest of the ""Man With No Name"" trilogy starring Clint Eastwood, ""For A Few Dollars More"" is the breakpoint where the series jumps from effective revenge drama into more ethereal, epic territory. If it's not as great as the third film, ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" it's still one of the most brilliant westerns, spaghetti or otherwise, ever made.The plot this time is more convoluted than it was the first time out, in ""A Fistful Of Dollars."" A bounty hunter who goes by the name ""Monco"" (Eastwood) gets on the trail of a crazed killer named Indio (Gian Maria Volante) and his gang, only to find another bounty hunter, Col. Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is just as close, and even more intent on collecting the reward for Indio's demise.The mood of the spaghetti western, that of a world where life being cheap except for those who collect money for taking it, is firmly established early on, where we witness a seemingly random killing during the opening credits, followed by several more courtesy of Monco and the Colonel. Monco at least seems willing to try to take his prey back alive, whereas the Colonel is less fussy. Director Sergio Leone made an effective vehicle with ""Fistful Of Dollars,"" one that launched Eastwood as a major star, but it is here he begins to make the case for a complex vision of the western as an existential stage for man's villainy, glory, and doom all at once.Calling it a spaghetti western makes it sound cheap. Sure, it's Italian, but if you have to note the country of origin, wouldn't it be better to call it a ""horse opera?"" The long, drawn-out pauses that establish mood, the way different parts create their own tone which meld seamlessly into the next, the complications in the unfolding of the narrative that set up exciting alternatives to audience expectations, the sense of divine judgment in a world where the existence of divinity itself seems in question, and finally that incredible Morricone score (much more diversified than we heard in ""Fistful,"" with some recognizable melodies and nice use of off-tones like the harmonica and that everpresent Jew's harp) all point to something with the heft and scale of Verdi. It's a western unlike anything that came before.Another welcome development is the humor. We got bits of that in ""Fistful,"" like Clint's reaction when he slugs a woman by mistake, but here there's some sections where the audience is encouraged to laugh even as the foreboding, alien mood of death and grief is being established. Like Manco's brief moment with the old man, ""Prophet,"" which has some nice eye-rolling from the tight-faced gunman; and the memorable match-lighting moments between Van Cleef and a nasty little hunchback played by Klaus Kinski. (Sauerkraut western?) Even Indio cracks wise on occasion, as when Cuchillo discovers where his knife went. ""That shouldn't be there, should it?"" he asks, almost innocently, though with appropriate menace.There are some logic gaps in the storyline, though they are not as distracting on repeat viewings as the ones in ""Fistful."" Volante has some effective moments as Indio, but then he goes over the top in other scenes. I think letting him wear the Adam Ant eyeliner in prison was a mistake, and so is an odd section of Morricone's score early on where he throws in some ""Dracula"" organ music. These are quibbles, and not enough for me to deny that it's my favorite Leone western. But taking a broader view, it's not as good as ""The Good, The Bad, And The Ugly,"" with the important insertion of Tuco's character, the Civil War backdrop, and a more effective and deliberate focus on the role of God in such a world as this. But if few movies of any kind are as good as `The Good, Bad, And Ugly,' this is a stirring establishment of the themes that film would work very hard and well at resolving.The best thing in this film is the relationship between Eastwood's character and Van Cleef's. It's a dance of distrust, and as much as Monco sets himself up as the antagonist, you have to wonder what the preternaturally poised Col. Mortimer has up his sleeve. Is he really playing it the way he says? Clearly he has some hidden motive, and given Van Cleef's sinister, devil-like visage, so effectively set up in the early scenes, you can't really blame Monco for his suspicions. All this is in the way of setting up one of the most satisfying resolutions in any western, where Leone makes his case for a director worthy of John Ford's heavy mantle.Has it really been 40 years since this came out? Funny this was the offspring of a Kurosawa imitation, since as a '60s icon, the No Name trilogy has become imitated on a scale second only to the Beatles. Tarantino, Scorsese, Raimi, the list goes on. As was said of the famed architect Christopher Wren, if you want to see Sergio Leone's memorial, just look around."
movie_nazi,"Sep 17, 2005",8/10,"Very few trilogies spark as much controversy as to which installment is the better than the ""Man With No Name"" movies. These movies not only started a genre(spaghetti westerns) but set a template as to how a great soundtrack can compliment a film rather well. Ennio Morricone is without a doubt, one of the greatest composers that ever decided to write scores for films. I'm not going to go into the plot of the movie for I find myself quite annoyed when I read a comment under movies that has everything short of the script written on them. But film fans and film students alike can really benefit from these films, especially For a Few Dollars More since it is arguably the best one. I personally like The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly best but For a Few Dollars More is probably the best one. This film has it all. Visuals, Leone's staple face close-ups, quirky one- -liners, and a soundtrack that will knock your socks off. Leone is a legend and a reminder that film DOES exist outside Hollywood."
ElMaruecan82,"Apr 13, 2012",9/10,"I will start this review by a simple comparison. I really feel that ""A Fistful of Dollars"", the first opus of Sergio Leone's Dollars Dollars trilogy owes to ""Yojinbo"" just as much as Francis Ford Coppola's ""The Godfather"" owes to Mario Puzo's novel. The creations that inspired the directors were significant, but not necessarily superior. I enjoy ""A Fistful of Dollars"" more than ""Yojinbo"" because Akira Kurosawa's film already had a Western feel that made the story stylishly awkward and let's face it, ""The Godfather"" as a novel, is not for literature what the film is for Cinema.Now, let me go further with my game of correspondences, ""For a Few Dollars More"", in my opinion, is for ""A Fistful of Dollars"" what ""The Godfather Part II"" is for ""The Godfather"", not by its status as a sequel or second installment but in the way it demonstrates Sergio Leone's capability to make an original film out of a material that didn't belong to him at first. Like Coppola who wrote an original plot involving characters he didn't create, Leone was able to take the same material of the first movie to make a truly original film and a beautiful continuation of the Man-With-No-Name's adventure. Call it inspiration or adaptation, the film is the proof that ""A Fistful of Dollars""' greatness didn't only rely on the fact that it was the remake of a foreign ingenuous script; it's the work of a talented director, that stands alone as a classic. And the confirmation came one year later with ""A Few Dollars More"", a major Western film that elevates Leone's status as a unique filmmaker and probably the most stylish and entertaining director of Westerns.The film opens with the opening statement : ""Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared""The film opens with the shooting of a man on his horse while the opening credits are conducted by Ennio Morricone's haunting score, maybe not the best, but this is not saying much when compared to ""A Fistful of Dollars"", ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" or ""Once Upon a Time in the West"". The film is about two bounty hunters, Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and Clint Eastwood as Manco, ""the one-armed man"" is a nickname due to his facility to use only one arm for shooting. Both are fast guns and professional bounty hunters, not the safest job but certainly the most profitable for as long as there would be criminals, there would be bounty hunters. Bounty hunters are as valuable for the Old West's society as buzzards and coyotes for the ecosystem. Like ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (and ""Yojinbo""), the protagonists are not the most moral characters in the world.Only, this time, the distinction between heroes and villains is clearer since the targets of the bounty hunters are criminals wanted dead or alive, which puts reasonable limitations on our level of empathy toward them. But again, the question is not to discuss the morality of this or that character, ""For a Few Dollars More"" invites us to follow a group of men, whose fates meet in a tale of revenge, vengeance, greed and strategy, surrounding three distinct figures. And beyond the coolness of Manco, the authority of Colonel Mortimer and the vileness of El Indio, the most hunted fugitive in the West, played by Gian Maria Volonte, they all share a common quality: they're domineering, intelligent and with a remarkable capacity to anticipate the moves of the adversaries. The plot evolves with a chess game precision. that reminded me of Kurosawa's ""Sanjuro"" And the chess game metaphor is even more eloquent when Manco and Colonel decides to team up and El Indio sacrifices some men to get away from them.And all through the film, it's impossible to determine who's the cleverest of the trio, each one has a moment to shine, and the film does a great job, developing the schemes of the three characters, from the bank robberies, to the way to get the safe from the bank of El Paso, and then to keep the loot, and share it with the team ... the film clearly points out that it's easy to steal money and difficult to keep it, it goes to subtle details where everything, every single action is guided by a desire to have 'a few dollars more', El Indio can have more money if he gets rid of some men, Manco and Colonel can have more of Indio's men if they team up, which means more money, or less, it depends. Greed acts like a double-edged sword and is obviously the most redoubtable enemy of each character.But beyond these philosophical undertones, the film proves to have much more depth than many Westerns, featuring a great set of spectacular scenes, carried by wonderful performances from Gian Maria Volonte, Lee Van Cleef, and Clint Eastwood and a honorable mention for Kinski as Wild, the hunchback. Cinema is missing such faces  ""For a Few Dollars More"" is full of so many memorable moments, probably the most defining being the pocket watch with the penetrating carillon music and Indio's unforgettable ""When the chimes end, pick up your gun"" The film is full of Leone's archetypes that became trademarks of the Western Spaghetti, with long close-ups on ugly, sweaty and greasy faces, and this beautiful profile shot where a face beautifully completes the landscape. Again, Leone provides a masterpiece of over-direction that elevates the most ordinary story to epic proportions, until an operatic and mind-blowing showdown.""A Fistful of Dollars"" was Leone making his entrance among the great directors, and ""For a Few Dollars More"" cemented the legend, and the best was still to come"
darimoviesthoughtsoffilms,"Feb 22, 2020",N/A,"For a few dollars more is about two bounty hunters teaming up for the reward of an outlaw.So recently I decided to start watching some western movies since I never really had done that before, and what better collection of western films to get started with is there but ""The Man With no Name"" trilogy? Even though I enjoyed the first film I was pretty surprised how much better this installment holds up to this day! The pacing is not actually that slow (which was my biggest issue regarding the first film) and the acting is excellent. It's entertaining to watch the cooperation between Monco (Clint Eastwood) and Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Without spoiling anything I can say that Lee Van Cleefs character is in no way weak, he seems to have a troubled past which makes the viewer care for him. The villain ""Indio"" (Gian Maria Volontè) is extremely unlikable in the way a villain should be because of his earlier decisions. The score is also amazing and really gives you that western vibe that this trilogy is so great at delivering. At the end my only problem with this film is kind of nit pick, but it's a nit pick that can confuse people that have watched ""A Handful of Dollars"". The villain is played by the same actor who played the villain of the first movie, which is pretty misleading since he's not playing the same villain/character.Overall I think any fans of the art of film should watch this film. It is available to stream on YouTube and Amazon Prime (at the time this review is written), but I do recommend you go out and buy the whole trilogy. A 9.4/10 from me!"
PartTimeCritic,"Mar 1, 2023",6/10,"For a Few Dollars More (C+): Leaving behind the simple narrative and practically static setting of A Fistful of Dollars, this film begins with the introduction of three characters: two bounty hunters collecting their targets, and a bandit escaping jail. It serves as an excellent introduction to the main characters and never bogs down into what I consider self-indulgent sequences in the way Leone would do in his later films. Despite the triple openings, the first act setup is simple and clear: Two skilled bounty hunters will be going after the same deadly target, how will this work out? The second act follows the bounty hunters discovering they are after the same prey, reluctantly teaming up, and then follows the cat and mouse trickery to get one over on the villain during an El Paso bank robbery. Unfortunately, everything after the bank robbery and before the finale is the kind of meaningless slog that I find in spades in Leone's bigger epics. In the end, I don't think the final acts of the film live up to the crisp and promising introductions."
dcavallo,"Jun 3, 2001",7/10,"In this sequel, a tale of two bounty hunters who reluctantly join forces to try and bring down the most vicious criminal on the frontier, the production values far outstrip those of ""A Fistful of Dollars"", yet the story doesn't rise to the level of the original.But ""For a Few Dollars More"" -- which would become the second part of a Sergio Leone's so-called ""Man With No Name"" trilogy -- is not to be missed by anyone with even a passing interest in offbeat Westerns.The obvious difference in the quality of the script is surely due to the fact that Leone was working without Kurosawa's mastery as a guide. (""Fistful,"" along with several other films in recent memory, is derived from the Japanese director's 'lone samurai' tale, ""Yojimbo."")But if Leone cannot compete with Kurosawa's storytelling genius (who himself had help from Ryuzo Kikushima and Dashiel Hammett) he was carving out his own unique niche in cinematic history.Here, the basic, irresistible elements of the ""Spaghetti Western"" -- Ennio Morricone's spare, knowing and highly dramatic score, Clint Eastwood's inscrutable half-eyed glare, the nearly comic circus-show gunplay -- familiar as a worn-in pair of boots to the great majority of American Sunday afternoon TV viewers, are solidified and put on full display.And they are unquestionably entertaining.By now parodied, emulated, and simply ripped off for decades, Leone, at the time, had managed to breathe new life (and death) into a genre that was fading at the hands of cinematic oversaturation -- just how many times could the same tale be told? -- and the advent of half-hour Western ""teleplays"".Eastwood's performance is essentially perfect, his presence as distinct as the noon sun over the desert sky, and Lee Van Cleef is a worthy foil. Gian Maria Volonté, the Italian actor who appears as the main (but different) villain in ""Fistful,"" is a greasy, psychotic sadist who the scenery chewing maniacs in modern films seem to owe a debt to.   The rest of the characters are drawn with similar wide strokes. (While Eastwood's ""heroes"" are often called amoral -- an assertion that doesn't really hold up under close scrutiny -- the supporting players are either pointing a gun at you, or with you.  Look for Klaus Kinski as the ""hunchback."")The dialogue, although it appears to have been filmed in English, is poorly re-dubbed, but nonetheless witty and terse, punctuated by some stunning heat-baked photography.  (If after you learn that these films were not shot in the States it becomes impossible for you to see anything but the parched sands of Spain, surely you will agree that the territory lends a powerfully sinister feel to the film.  Leone's greatest strength may have been that he seemed to set his Westerns on a slightly different planet than our own.)The film's main flaw -- and I can already hear the noir enthusiasts moaning -- is that there are a few too many twists and turns down the dusty trails, and slightly weary viewers may lose the satisfaction when the inevitable ""moment of reckoning"" arrives at the end of the film.Overall, this is a very good film -- fans of more modern films might liken the differences between ""Fistful"" and ""A Few Dollars More"" to those between Robert Rodriguez's low-budget debut ""El Mariachi,"" and his Hollywood remake, ""Desperado.""  Both are worthy films, but the grit of the original is more satisfying.It is important to note that Leone hit both marks -- realism and big-budget spectacle -- with the incredible ""Once Upon A Time In The West."""
MickeyTheConstant,"Aug 22, 2020",10/10,"It's been years since I watched this movie and it was just pure nostalgia for me. I remember watching this movie m as my times with my Dad and especially on a Sunday night, late on BBC2. Anyway enough about me. This has always been my favourite of the trilogy. I love the Eastwood and Van Cleef chemistry. The back story of the watch is great and the baddie has to be one of the best villains of all time. Just crazy and scary psycho crazy who makes you feel uncomfortable throughout. The final shootout is one of the best you will see and the score is amazing especially the watch music. It's epic on every scale, never dates and the heroes are still super cool. Just pure cinema."
joshi_3592,"Oct 23, 2009",10/10,"The Man with No Name or Manco returns in ""for a few dollars more"" the sequel to the Italo-Western success ""a fistful of dollars"". I must say I liked this movie even better than it's predecessor, and I really liked it's predecessor. now Clint Eastwood's character ""the man with no name"" is a timeless character, the only flaw of the first movie being that it was only about him. In this movie we get a triple storyline. Lee Van Cleef stars as Colonel Douglas Mortimer a bounty killer (another name for bounty hunter) who get's in the way of ""the man with no name"" and they decide to team up. They're both after the escaped criminal ""El Indio"" played by Gian Maria Volontè, who has the third part of the storyline. I honestly had to check if I hadn't accidentally turned on the sequel ""the good, the bad and the ugly"" when I saw this film.There are really no flaws in this movie, it has obviously dated a lot being from 1965, having some cheesy music once in a while, and some poor dubbing. But considering it's time I really don't see that as a negative.The acting is great and the story is wonderful. Action, but not to much action. Dialogue but not to much dialogue. the movie is perfectly balanced. Also it's almost forty minutes longer than the prequel, yet the prequel felt a lot slower than this movie. Adding the extra character to this movie was a great idea, and I look forward to seeing Lee Van Cleef in the sequel.This movie is a true Western classic, it's Sergio Leone at his best. And ""the man with no name"" is a truly unforgettable character. i give this movie a 10/10."
antoniocenteno-87266,"Mar 14, 2020",10/10,"""Where life has no value sometimes death has a price"". Damn, that is a statment when you get into a movie, really gets you into the idea of the film itself and gives an idea of how this movie is more cold, brutal and thrilling than any other western released at the time.This movie gets slamed right in the middle of the Dollars Trilogy of Leone-Eastwood, it really feels like the must underrated western ever made, probably overshadowed by the third film of the trio, at the same time this one is a complete different beast and introduced to mainstream the concept of cool bounty hunters.As the other two movies wecan talk about Leone´s Direction, Morricone´s music and Eastwood perfomance, as well the cinematography and themes of the movie for ages, still that´s beend done several times, so for save your time let me say: IT´S AS GLORIOUS AS ALWAYS. So Let´s try talk about other aspects that differnced this movie and gave a big step forward to this kind of cinema.This movie was a gigantic improvement over A Fistful of Dollars, that movie had good pacing, shots, direction, score adn acting and everything here is much better, taking some limitations that slowed the other movie and improving them, like lightning and close ups. Lee van Cleef gives such a great perfomance in this movie as a smart ass Colonel one step over the Man with no name, this movie really takes the time to develope a feud with Gian Maria Volonte as el Indio wich makes the final confrontation so good and takes some spotlight away from Eastwood´s charachter that let the movie feel like a fresh take on this instalment.The only real sin i´ve seen in this movie is a peace of scene where for some reason Manco has a black face wich remind me a lot of Arnie Scharzzeneger in Predator, some seconds after the black face is gone and really that shot wan´t worth it, but that´s it.This is a classic Westerns saddly overshadowed by Leone´s next two movies but definetly a classic and a new take on Spaggethi Westerns."
JohnWelles,"Jun 30, 2009",10/10,"Sergio Leone's celebrated Spaghetti Western ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" (1965) isn't like the rest of the so-called ""Dollars Trilogy"". The great Lee Van Cleef is the first person after the titles you meet and you seen a lot the action through his eyes, rather that Clint Eastwood's. For example, its Lee Van Cleef you are with at the climatic shootout, not Eastwood. A another example is after Eastwood's character (Manco) betrays Lee Van Cleef's character (Col. Douglas Mortimer), it is Van Cleef sitting on top of a building pointing a gun at Eastwood, something that would probably happen the other way round in a different ""Dollars"" film. All in all, a one of the very greatest of the Spaghetti Westerns."
greg-04082,"Oct 21, 2018",6/10,"The music and cinematography in this is excellent, but as another reviewer suggested, the movie ends up being a slog because it's too long for the material. Unfortunately, Leone had the view that longer was better:Fistful of Dollars: 99 minutes
For a Few Dollars More: 132 minutes
Good the Bad and the Ugly: 3 hoursFistful was probably the best with a story lifted from Kurosawa and a tight runtime.For a few dollars more has interesting leads but the middle act is drawn out and difficult to follow. Fortunately it's not as bad as Good the Bad and the Ugly which is a mess plotwise."

helpless_dancer,"Feb 26, 2004",7/10,"After leaving commercials and the dull portrayal of Rowdie Yates, Eastwood finally got into something that I still enjoy watching - spaghetti westerns. Often corny and poorly acted I nevertheless sat thoroughly entranced as this seemingly heartless gunslinger hammered his way through a troop of vulgar, totally Satanic bandits who were intent on heaping as much destruction on the world as they were able to before their sorry lives burned out or stopped at the end of a smoking barrel. Which was the case here, of course; the point of the entire picture in fact. Van Cleef as Colonel Mortimer turned in one of his better performances as the revengeful reaper. Fortunately, in many cases anyway, this evil looking character actor went on to starring in many pasta movies of his own."

The cinematography of the desert and mountains was great at the start.Acting a bit dated with the facial emotion close ups, but okay, sure it was the 60's.I can't understand why anyone would rate this a 10/10 unless they were 10 years old and they got excited because there were guns and they got to stay up late.The story is not interesting, there are no real surprises, the villains make stupid choices or just stand around helplessly until they are shot.A bank is robbed, they go to the hideout and hide. Not any reasons to care too much about any of these characters."
Red-Barracuda,"Dec 29, 2011",8/10,"The second film in Sergio Leone's 'Dollars Trilogy' is a definite progression from A Fistful of Dollars. Utilizing many of the same cast members, Leone's follow up is more layered and stylised than before. It was the most successful Italian film of its time and remained so into the early 70's. For this reason its probably fair to say that more than any other movie, this was the definitive template of the Spaghetti Western genre. Its story of mean bad guys and mean good guys entwined in a revenge plot was mimicked several times in other Italian movies. Leone, however, was the master of this sub-genre and in this film he begins to really show why. It's paced magnificently and is consistently visually arresting. It exhibits many of the director's recurring imagery - extreme close-ups, scenes of operatic violence and an eye for interesting faces. But of course, this is only part of the story because what would these films be without the contribution of Ennio Morricone? The soundtrack maestro is once again on peerless form and the score is quite brilliant. It's unthinkable to imagine Leone's films without the contribution of this musical genius. Similarly, the cast add good value. Clint Eastwood is a solid presence but he is overshadowed by Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer – despite being top billed Eastwood often essentially played second fiddle to his co-star, think also of Eli Wallach in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. The villains are also very good too. Gian Maria Volonté is always compelling as the chief psychopath, what with his mixture of physical menace and psychological damage. But perhaps best of all is Klaus Kinski as the unforgettable hunchback bandit. He is criminally under used, however.For a Few Dollars More is not quite up to the standard of Leone's two masterpieces that followed it – The Good, the Bad and the Ugly and Once Upon a Time in the West – but it remains an awesome western nevertheless, and perhaps the best place for a novice to start when first dipping into the joys that constitute the Spaghetti Western genre."
hitchcockthelegend,"Nov 15, 2015",9/10,"The middle part of Sergio Leone's dollars trilogy sandwich is a mighty hunk of meat and pasta. Plot has Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as bounty hunters who form a very uneasy alliance to bring down violent bandit El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè) and his gang.As befitting Leone in this sub-genre, the pic positively oozes charisma and class. His compositions are as striking as the coolness he wrings out from his lead actors, the characterisations bristling with a calm grizzle factor that beguiles as the story jumps from violence to suspense, from humour to misery, with surprises is store as well. The screenplay adheres to some clichés of the Western formula, but never at a cost to suspense and mystery, such as with the finale that looks set to be formulaic, but joyfully brings its own identity whilst simultaneously adding extra layers to the protags and antag. The dialogue (Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni) pings with literacy, something which is a pleasant mercy in the Spaghetti Western world, while Morricone fills the key scenes with aural shards of atmospheric delight.A great film in its own standalone right, but also a super precursor to The Good, the Bad and the Ugly. 9/10"

What's great about A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly and this one in particular is that they are so different to any other western. Stylish as hell and directed and co-written by master filmmaker Sergio Leone. Special mention as well for Ennio Morricone's music."
Bobby Gator,"Aug 14, 2000",10/10,"My favorite movie of all time, more than fifty viewings, each one better than the last, as all elements erupt in simple power, from desolate desert to marauding music to hard men in dusty boots with mean guns, all bravado cut lean across Clint and Indio and Lee Van Cleef whose lives are boiled to the basics of greed and violence where the blood runs between life and death."
jldmp1,"May 21, 2006",7/10,"The opportunity for greatness in the cinema in this period arose out of a simple, but central paradigm shift: the displacement of white hat vs. black hat with irony, ambiguity and self-examination.This had unique possibilities within westerns, because of the innate advantage of large settings, and larger than life, archetypal characters.Whereas Kurosawa did this with Japanese craft, Leone's m.o. is Italian expressionist excess. So Van Cleef has not just one weapon, but an arsenal...Volonte doesn't just escape prison, he kills the lawman who put him there AND his family, AND any temporary ally that suits him...Eastwood doesn't just off the bad guys, he carts away fourteen at once, limbs in all directions.There's a brilliant scene that has all three interested parties counting out the guards' steps around El Paso bank, combining mastery of the style, camera perspectives and ambiguity.Where it gets dicey is the attempt to leverage story ironies -- the questions of who trusts who, and for what reasons. Leone attempts to give El Indio an ironic edge with the conflation of memory, rape, guilt and honor triggered by the pocket watch chimes (expanding into a Fugue). But I don't think this is a real success -- Volonte is still a single-minded villain who just wants a 'larger share of dollars'. As it turns out, Eastwood and Van Cleef are essentially single-minded good guys too, the plot twist at the end notwithstanding.What would have propped this up more effectively is some framing device; say for example, a character within who discovers and documents the narrative -- the kind of device hinted at in ""Unforgiven""."
mark-rojinsky,"Aug 29, 2023",7/10,"Ennio Morricone's score is enthralling:- an angelic, soaring ethereal female chorus accompanied by silver triangles and deep bassoon. His ''Ecstasy of Gold'' in The Good, the Bad and the Ugly (1968) is equally as inspiring. Another Italian maestro- Piero Piccioni also composed a thrilling 'hairs-stand-on-the-back-of-your-neck' opening score for the adventure film, The Light at the Edge of the World (1971) starring Kirk Douglas, Fernando Rey and Yul Brynner, showing just how talented those Italian composers in the '60s/70s were. London's Time Out Film Guide refers to Clint Eastwood's '..super-cool, taciturn gun-slinger' and '.... Morricone's terrific score'. When interviewed by the B. B. C. In 1989 relating to a tribute programme dedicated to Leone and Lee Van Cleef, English film expert, Christopher Grayling explained that Leone wanted to conjure a kind of 'flamboyant rhetoric' to transcend the traditional Hollywood oater. And that he had originally wanted that most rhythmic of US actors - lanky, silver-haired, toothy, James Coburn - as the character played by Eastwood."
AaronCapenBanner,"Sep 8, 2013",9/10,"Clint Eastwood returns as the Man with no name, a wandering gunfighter, now bounty hunter, who, along with Col. Mortimor(played by the appealing and steely-eyed Lee Van Cleef)is after a big bounty on crazy Indio(Gian Maria Vollante)and his gang. Both men distrust each other at first, but come to an understanding, and form a partnership, pledging to split the reward money; that is of course, dependent on them surviving the ordeal, involving Eastwood infiltrating the gang...Marvelous sequel is much better, thanks to two unforgettable lead performances, and incredibly stylish direction by Sergio Leone and music score by Mr. Morricone. Long but involving story is most compelling, and film remains a firm classic."
BananaWizard1,"Jan 25, 2023",10/10,"If someone mentions the words ""spaghetti western"", for most people, the Dollars trilogy with Clint Eastwood by Sergio Leone will come to mind. ""A Fistful of Dollars"" is widely remembered as being the first spaghetti western to redefine the genre, in addition to kickstarting the carrers of Eastwood, Leone and Morricone. ""Il buono, il brutto, il cattivo"" permanently changed, not only the Europen westerns, but the western genre as a whole with the perfect cast, perfet soundtrack and the instantly recognizeable soundtrack. However, the Dollars trilogy's overlooked film, ""For a few Dollars More"" is , in my opinion, as good as ""The good, the bad and the Ugly"", in addition to being my favorite of the trilogy. As opposed to the previous film, the stoty here is a bit deeper, with a certain mystery that only becomes solved at the last scene. In addition to Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef enters the cast as Colonel Douglas Mortimer, a former soldier-turned bounty hunter. Van Cleef´s acting, especially in the duel, is perfect, because of how he is mad, sad, excited, ready and badass all rolled into one. Gian Maria Volonte, playing a different mexican bad guy than from ""Fistful"", is great as El Indio, if not a bit theatrical (he was a stage actor). And who could forget Josef Egger as the old prophet. The scope has also increased tremendously from ""Fistful"". They visit at least 5 towns, mutliple jails, a train, sallons, and, of course, the beautiful Almeria desert. The soundtrack for this film is also beautiful, and the diuels are all accompanied by fantastic scores. The film is, in my opinion, the funniest spaghetti western (aside from the comedies, of course). The humor is more subtle as opposed to jokes, with countless memorable ones (the hotel owners, the old prophet, the not-so-politically-correct hotel worker, the ""robbery"" at Santa Cruz, the old prophet and many more). This movie pioneered Sergio Leone´s style and takes it´s time with telling the story, something that i appreciate. The dialogue and scrips has definetly improved since ""Fistful"", thanks to Segio Donati and Luciano Vincenzoni. There´s countless things i could say about this film, but I think it´s time to wrap it up.This film is my personal favorite of the Dollars trilogy, which says a lot. The score by Ennio Morricone helps to define it as the masterpiece it is. Pretty much everything has improved since their last film and is a beautiful, fun and underrated film, and a must watch for everyone."
Whaley_M,"May 6, 2020",8/10,There are some great duo's in the west and Clint Eastwood alongside Lee Van Cleef is one of the greatest. Sergio Leone is a master of his craft and when they all come together we are graced with timeless classics.
wizzardSS,"Aug 8, 2012",9/10,"This would be the only film from the Dollars Trilogy (between A Fistful of Dollars and The Good, The Bad And The Ugly) that isn't an Empire 5-star rated film. So, in order to complete the trilogy, I decided to watch this one anyway to satisfy my need for completion to see why it wasn't awarded the prestigious five stars.Compared with A Fistful Of Dollars, For A Few Dollars More is a far more developed film, albeit a completely different story. The stories lead into each other though (although you don't need to watch the first to understand the second), as The Man With No Name continues his bounty work which we are introduced to in the predecessor.The introduction of The Man In Black - Colonel Douglas Mortimer - helps to prove that Eastwood's Man With No Name - this time referred to as Manco - is not as omnipotent as he appeared in the first film. That said, Eastwood's character still retains the mystery as the number of lines he is given are few and far between. We never learn much him, but that doesn't stop us admiring his quick hands.For A Few Dollars More also uses the same iconic soundtrack as its predecessor and, while its whistling can become irritating, it is one of the key driving forces behind the film as the camera flicks between characters during the agonising stand-off.Personally, I prefer this film to its predecessor. Maybe its because I knew what to expect, but its probably more likely that Sergio Leone was given far more freedom to express his unique characters."
lastliberal,"Jun 1, 2007",9/10,"Fans of Quentin Taratino need to watch the Sergio Leone trilogy: Fistful of Dollars, For a few Dollars More, and The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly to see what inspired him to the achievements he has made as a director.Fans of Clint Eastwood need no encouragement to see him in his early work on his way to stardom.Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef are bounty hunters on the trail of El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè). Eastwood is out for the money, but Van Cleef has other motives. Bullets fly, bodies are stacked like cord wood, and the action never stops all to incredible music by Ennio Morricone.Enjoy!"
Bezenby,"Apr 29, 2017",9/10,"Second time out, Leone scores top marks. The build up to gunfights are more drawn out and stylized, the cackling has been amped up a notch, the ridiculously accurate marksmanship reaches surreal levels, and Leone isn't in a hurry to do anything, marrying silence or Morricone's soundtrack with scenes where people just stare at each other, smoke, or lead horses through sudden rainburst. This is third in the top twenty films on the Spaghetti Western database, only beaten by the next two films Leone directed! Van Cleef plays Col. Mortimer, a bounty hunter with an arsenal of weapons used for taking out the bad guys. He gets particularly riled when he spots a wanted poster for Indio (Volonte), a dope smoking bank robber who has just been busted out of jail. Mortimer's going to find out that he's not the only hunter on Indio's tail, as the Man With No Name (called Manko here) is also out to get that bounty.It takes about an hour for the above paragraph to happen, but you won't care. In that time we find that Indio is holding a dark secret he keeps at bay with drugs, and has something to do with that pocket watch he carries. We also get to see that the Bounty Hunters are just as deadly as the bad guys too, and there's a kind of battle of the wills going on between Eastwood and Van Cleef.This film is exactly what you want from a Spaghetti Western. Reality goes out of the window and instead you get a film where men can stop and start spurs spinning by shooting them, or continually shoot a hat up into the air, or light a match off of Klaus Kinski's hump. It's all look amazing too, thanks to Massimo Dallamano's cinematography, which looks like an oil painting (he does the same in his own Western, Bandidos).Luigi Pistilli stands out in this one too, as one of the smarter members of Indio's gang, which is maybe why he's got a bigger role in The Good, The Bad and The Ugly. Of course Klaus Kinski appears in more Spaghetti Westerns than anyone else, including The Fighting Fists Of Shanghai Joe, His Name Is King, And God Said To Cain, (continues listing films)"
moh-nikkhoo,"Feb 7, 2015",N/A,"I watched this films few years after the other Sergio Leone's films in his western Trilogy. This one neither has a strong story like ""a fistful of dollars"" (which was made based on Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" (1961)) nor was as great as ""the good, the bad and the ugly"". But it has everything that you expected from a spaghetti western at highest quality. The one thing that made this film memorable is its music by ""Ennio Morricone"", which I believe is even better than ""the good, bad and ugly"" music. It goes up and down with the story and is one of the best music film that I have ever heard. Music made this film a memorable classical film."
CuriosityKilledShawn,"Jan 18, 2012",7/10,"Life is cheap out in the Old West, unless you're a bounty hunter, in which case it's a profitable way to make a living. With so many roustabouts getting up to no good it was inevitable that Indio, the biggest and baddest of all, would attract the attention of two men with very different motives.Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monco (Eastwood) eventually cross paths and form a tenuous partnership to catch Indio, who has just been broken out of jail by his loyal men and is planning a big bank robbery. Mortimer and Monco work together, and against each other, in order to bring him in, and all his men, to maximize their rewards.It's a long film, but it has enough time to indulge in over-the-top moments. I especially like Clint and Van Cleef squaring up to each other by shooting hats. It's ridiculous, but good. Some of the widescreen photography is particularly memorable. It's all grainy, gritty stuff but it's a rough edge you just don't get anymore, which is a loss to modern movie which all just look too slick.Ennio Morricone also provides a wonderful score that's utterly timeless and turns many scenes into an overblown opera.I'm in the mood for Spaghetti now."
tomb_92,"May 10, 2010",8/10,"I was very surprised at this film. I was impressed with A Fistful of Dollars, but For a Few Dollars More was just wonderful. The plot was better, and more interesting, though the film was slightly too long for my liking. The chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef was fantastic to watch, but the thing I enjoyed most about this film was the villain. This character was wonderfully realised as a sadistic maniac who was thrilling to watch. The film was surprisingly emotional, especially the scenes involving the villain and the musical locket. It was more thrilling, more interesting and more engaging than it's predecessor, and some scenes in particular took my breath away."
raphaklopper,"Oct 5, 2013",10/10,"Thanks to the huge success of ""A Fistful of Dollars"", which thanks to Sergio Leone began a new era for Western movies and mark the beginning of his and Eastwood career. Sergio Leone began to make the ""sequel"" with the same cast of his predecessor, bigger, but with small errors it doesn't surpasses its predecessor, but continued epic and Badass!""For a few dollars more"", begins with the cruel criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté) escaping from a Mexican prison with the help of his gang killing in cold blood all the guards on their way. The news comes fast with wanted posters with his pictures scattered in all American cities. One of the posters captured the attention of Col. Douglas Mortimer, a bounty hunter who soon begins to plan how to get Indio dead or alive. Not only Mortimer, but also caught the attention of Monco (Clint Eastwood), another bounty hunter who also covets the reward for the capture or death of Indio. When both hunters unwittingly meet each other face to face, knowing Indio's plan to rob a bank heavily guarded, they decide to work together to get Indio and share the big reward for Indio and his gang. But Monco discovers that Mortimer objectives go far beyond that to receive the reward, much darker than that.Many consider that this movie is not a sequel, but according to Eastwood it is. The reason for this consideration is mainly Eastwood's character. While in the predecessor he was this mysterious man who called himself Joe, trying to take advantage of a gang war cashing out at the end. And in this one he is a bounty hunter who calls himself ""Monco"" who makes a certain justice catching and killing criminals, those are the differences but the age of time is the same. The first movie was located at the time of the gang warfare on the frontier and the time of the American cavalry, and this one is happening in 1873, the same historical age. And, Joe-Monco in the first one he heard advices from the city's innkeeper saying that one day everyone had to sit in one and honest work, that is exactly what he does this one. Killing bad folks and earning money.The film's problems are few and forgivable, but compared with the 1st movie, it makes a certain lack. I'm talking about the film's narrative, while in the 1st movie she was very well written and flowed perfectly in a superb script. In this one, the 1st hour of the movie almost nobody says something, and we only know most of the story in the remaining hours of the film, now flowing perfectly. And in the first film since the first half hour we were completely coated in history. But this was actually Eastwood's own idea. He liked so much of his character that he starts investing and exploring a lot (the Joe-Monco fur were from Eastwood). And advised Leone to him give less dialog to increase the mystery of his character, and of course, increase our Goosebumps when he talks.But this little problem, paved the way for the magnificent direction of Leone. Not only in the duels scenes, which here are not only better than the 1st movie but are more tense and the direction in each one is simply superb. But the moments that stand out are the fantastic Italian and Spanish landscapes serving as the American Old West.And the performances simply excellent: Clint Eastwood.....do I need to say something?; Gian Maria Volonte who was almost the same role in the 1st movie, the good shooting and cruel villain, but thanks to his exuberant performance it lends an air of a psychopathic villain; Lee Van Cleef superb. Leone's idea of putting two Badasses shooters is a experiencing that at the time of the film no one had ever seen it, jaws went straight to the floor and the chills came by every word. And the duel between the two, it was advanced for the time, is not a duel with both shooting each other, but each one testing the skills of each other.This movie is one of those sequels that are only one step behind the predecessor. But thanks to the genius of Leone in both direction and screenplay, and the exuberant performances, ""For a few dollars more"" remains an excellent continuation and an important part in the masterpiece trilogy.10/10"
valleyjohn,"Jan 3, 2009",8/10,"Where life had no value, death, sometimes, had its price. That is why the bounty killers appeared.""These are the famous words that greet the viewer at the start of ""For A Few Dollars More"". The Follow up to Sergio Leone"" A Fist Full Of Dollars"". The first film , although groundbreaking , had many Faults. The good thing is , that with the follow up , Leone seems to have ironed out the glitches and has produced a near perfect Western.Eastwood is a keen-eyed, quick-witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio, the territory's most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival, Colonel Mortimer , is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive! Failing to capture their prey - or eliminate each other - the two are left with only one option: team up, or face certain death at the hands of Indio and his band of murderous outlaws.It's very important when making a western to have characters that you love and hate. Heroes and Villains. With the original film there was Clint Eastwood "" The man with no name"" and he was the only one with any personality to speak off.With this film we are introduced to not only Eastwood's character again but Col. Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef ) and El Indio ( Gian Maria Volontè) . One a suave looking stranger and sharp shooter who has a score to settle and the other a ruthless bandit who is tortured by his evil past.Talking of Scores , the music is amazing . The haunting sound of that electric guitar is a constant companion and is one of the most iconic scores in movie history.Lee Van Cleef for me is the star of the film. His addition is a stroke of genius of Leone's part. The director also added quite a lot of humour to the film which the first definitely lacked.There are so many great scenes in this movie but my favourite has to be the stand off at the end. When El Indio says to the Colonel ""When the chimes end, pick up your gun."" Go ahead and shoot me Colonel. Just try."" He opens up that pocket watch and the chimes that have troubled both men for years , start . You know there is only going to be one winner.My favourite Western of all time has always been"" The Magnificent Seven"" but now there is a clear contender for that title.I will be reviewing the final film in the trilogy "" The Good the Bad and The Ugly"" very soon and if it's true what they say that this is the best of the three , then i cant wait!9 out 10"

frankde-jong,"Aug 7, 2023",7/10,"After reviewing ""A fistfull of dollars"" (1964, Sergio Leone) it is hard to write something new about ""For a few dollars more"" (1965, Sergio Leone), the second episode of the ""Dollar -"" or ""Man with no name"" trilogy.The same characteristics (much violence, frequent close ups, shootouts drawn out in long takes) are present. Because Leone had somewhat more experience the story is somewhat more complex and longer. In effect every episode of the trilogy lasted approximately half an hour longer (""A fistfull of dollars"" 99 minutes, ""For a few dollars more"" 132 minutes and finally ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" 161 minutes.The major innovation of this film is introducing a second lead character in the form of Douglas Mortimer (Lee van Cleef). Lee van Cleef had ample experience in classic (not spaghetti) Westerns like ""High Noon"" (1952, Fred Zinnemann) and ""The man who shot Liberty Valance"" (1962, John Ford). Lee van Cleef would return in ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966).In ""A fistfull of dollars"" there is one bounty hunter dealing with two gangs. In ""For a few dollars more"" there are two bounty hunter dealing with one gang.""A few dollars more"" is a darker movie than his predecessor. Became the man with no name in ""A fistfull of dollars "" only halfway the movie the good guy (because of a woman), in ""For a few dollars more"" he remains an opportunist until the very end. Only in the final episode ""The good, the bad and the ugly"" (1966) the man with no name is good from the beginning onwards."

I saw the film some years ago but it has influenced me very much and i thaught about it a lot. i like it more than the good, bad and the ugly because of: 1. the story is more serious than the good, bad and the ugly 2. the friendship between Manco and Colonel 3. starrings of major characters 4. the timing is in balance and not too long like the third part of dollars trilogy and many other reasons.."
adamjohns-42575,"Sep 22, 2023",6/10,"For A Few Dollars More (2?) (1965) -In a fight my money was on Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer. He was definitely the better character in this film, although I did like the interactions between him and Clint Eastwood as Monco.I would have liked to have seen more scuffles and action in it though. It all seemed to be saved up for the end, which caused it to drag a bit, especially for someone who wouldn't choose a western as their first genre to watch, although with that said, I have been surprised by a number of them lately and I actually thought that this one had the better story and delivery over 'The Good, The Bad And The Ugly' (1966), which is the one that tends to appear on more of the top film lists.Some of the supporting characters were a bit corny and badly dubbed, which let things down somewhat, but Gian Maria Volontè was quite sexy in his role of El Indio. His stoned out weirdness was really hard to deal with however and didn't necessarily add to his part.It took a long time to really get in to things with the story. By the time Clint and Lee met and decided to work together and then went after their bounty, I felt that it had been a whole film already, not for the content, but for the length of the set up.I was glad that there wasn't a larger romantic element though, because I find that can ruin a good cowboy film. I did wish that there had been more action and less of the ""Drama"" however, because the two lead characters would have lent themselves more to that sort of gunslinging and body count type of film, rather than the buddy picture that this almost turned in to.Finally I would say that some of the background music was absolutely awful and went right through me. It was incredibly piercing at times and not really that necessary at all.It wasn't a bad film of its type and I preferred Clint here than in some of his others. When 'Magnificent Seven' (1960) was remade in 2016, I wondered if we would see a plethora of western revival's and I certainly felt that this story would be worth a revisit, just with a slight polish and a modern look at delivering it as something artistic and thoughtful instead of something churned out for box office figures.617.89/1000."
edwagreen,"Jul 28, 2006",1/10,"A young Clint Eastwood and the late Lee Van Cleef star in this typical spaghetti western.An alternate title may have been ""Mutiny Among The Bounty Hunters.""The film starts off with the exploits of Van Cleef and Eastwood as bounty hunters. They shoot their hearts off and along the way, they collect nice money while lodging bullets in the heads of their wanted outlaws.Their big task is to get a noted outlaw, who with a group of 15 others, is planning a major bank robbery. Turns out that one of the bounty hunters wants him for personal reasons as well.The film is often slow paced. It's entirely too violent for our tastes. The scene where our major bandit blows away a young mother and her 18 month old is not shown but you feel the emotion when the gun goes off and off."
monabassil,"Jul 12, 2000",10/10,"Before giving a comment, let me introduce the film to the readers: in 1964, Italian Director Sergio Leone made `A Fistful Of Dollars' starring Clint Eastwood and (the gorgeous!) Gian Maria Volonté. A year later, Leone made `For A Few Dollars More', and, in 1966, his masterpiece `The Good, The Bad and the Ugly'. The 3 films are known as `the so-called Dollars trilogy'.I watched the films in the wrong order, but I must say that FAFDM is an archetypal `Spaghetti Western', a genre characterized by a deceivingly simple plot, few but ironic lines, absurd coincidences, and intense violence. In FAFDM, Gian Maria Volonté and Lee Van Cleef gave a stunning performance, the former as a psychotic criminal, the latter as a cynical bounty killer. And, in the middle, the laconic man with no name (Clint Eastwood), another bounty killer, pairs up with either of the other two, depending on his interest.The soundtrack of that film, provided by the creative Ennio Morricone, was cleverly used to match the scenes.  Watch out for the scene from the past where Volonté rapes Van Cleef's sister, and for the crosscutting between Van-Cleef's eyes and Volonté's face in his wanted' portrait. And Eastwood counts Volonté's men in terms of how much money their heads are worth!That film is rather long, but highly creative and entertaining. I've watched it 3 times and will watch it a 100 times again.If you're looking for THE Spaghetti Western, `For A Few Dollars More' would be it. And, trust me, you should own all three films, like I do, and their breathtaking soundtracks"
odislene,"Jan 10, 2006",10/10,"Just seeing the quality of the images, the photography, and the cool faces (I can't imagine a western hunter with other type of face), makes this movie excellent. The plot is not very complicated and you can argue some decisions made by the villain, but even with that, I think is very intelligent and probably by that you can't guess what is next. Eastwood, Cliff and 'El Indio' are good in their roles and the direction of Leone is superb. No doubt, Leone can be considered the best western director of all time, not by one movie but for his complete work.Please, watch this movie and rank it. Definitely, it will be in your list for the best westerns of all time."
diac228,"May 25, 2009",9/10,"Most film majors, film scholars, wanna-be film experts, and film historians will credit whether Once Upon a Time in the West and/or The Good, the Bad, and Ugly as Leone's best work. Well, they are all wrong. Going by the instinct that my opinion is better than everyone else's, For a Few Dollars More is Leone at his peak, and one of the better westerns of all-time. Unlike the two films first mentioned, this one doesn't overstay its welcome, doesn't drift off into unnecessary scenes, and ultimately presents Eastwood (and Lee Van Cleef) at his top form. For a Few Dollars More is spaghetti western at its absolute finest, and should be viewed at least once by any fans of the wild west.For a Few Dollars More (No longer under the rage of Kurosawa) is about two bounty hunters after a vicious criminal that recently escaped from prison with the help of his friends. While Man With No Name (Eastwood, of course) is in it for the money, Mortimer's reasons seem a bit more blurred. The film becomes a massive cats-and-mice game as both bounty hunters compete to catch and kill the criminal first.All the elements that made A Fistful of Dollars work were improved upon here: the directing, cinematography, acting, pacing, and musical score. The close-ups, long shots, and quick edits are all Leone's signature, and yet again keep the movie moving and entertaining. The story is not only more original the second time around, but is deeper, and more engrossing.Geez Louise, can I discuss the music here? Morricone's music is truly epic and is twice as good as the first film in the trilogy, and arguably almost as good as his most popular score (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly). Whether it's the simple drumming during a stand-off, a bittersweet pocket watch song, or the fantastic theme in the beginning, Morricone's music should have earned him an Oscar that year (Does anybody even remember Doctor Zhivago's music?). Not only is it great music, but one of the best soundtracks of all-time. To this day the music's influence can be heard: Hans Zimmer's nods to him occur in the Pirates of the Caribbean series.Like the previous installment, there are no heroes in this tale; just a lot of ruthless men fighting each other to reach their just rewards. What makes Few Dollars More better than The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly are two main things: the pacing and the balance of characters. In The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, the movie lasts more than 160 minutes and most of it is focused on The Ugly, by far the least interesting character. The Man With No Name doesn't even do much in the third installment, especially compared to this one. The other issue is pacing; the film like I previously stated is closing in on three hours. In this movie, a mere two hours, perfectly manageable two hours.Bottom Line: A great western with plenty of action and superb storytelling to sink your teeth into. Leone's directing is at his best here, Eastwood is gripping and entertaining, and Morricone's music is sure to leave you enchanted. Unlike Leone's later films that drag on endlessly, this film is well-paced and well-equipped with plenty of tension and excitement. Recommend to all those whom enjoy a good western that pulls no punches."
fear_and_loathing1,"Oct 1, 2006",9/10,"""For a few dollars more"" is definitely one of the greatest westerns made; along side Leone's classic ""The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly"".Its dirty, violent yet simple story line is what made this film a classic. A tale of two gunslingers on the hunt for a ruthless bandit amongst the frontier. Its chilling music scores and fight scenes definitely influenced the movie makers of today, and completes the ""the man with no name"" trilogy.The mixture of Ennio Morricones music scores and Leoni's brilliant direction and characters is what makes his spaghetti westerns truly remarkable."
christopher-underwood,"Jul 10, 2020",9/10,"A thrilling and wonderful looking film with a sumptuous soundtrack and iconic performances. It is, nevertheless, easy to forget how important this film was in so many ways. Following on from A Fistful of Dollars (1964) Sergio Leone decided a follow up was possible and so began his short but sensational directorial career. Clint Eastwood agreed to star once more, thereby cementing his move from TV to cinema and becoming an international star along the way, not mention becoming many a young teen's poster hero. Lee Van Cleef, who had had a successful but largely unnoticed film career, that began with a small part in High Noon (1952) was brought in to co-star. His rise to fame would not be as meteoric as Eastwood's but his mesmerising performance ensured a big enough future with many fine roles. Luigi Pistilli was retained from the first film and his solid performance and good looks would ensure that he too would make many more high profile films, particularly in the world of the giallo but also more such westerns and crime films. Indeed the film world in Italy had already begun to explode with more such Italian style westerns, after the first film, but now the phenomenon was unstoppable and the term spaghetti western was coined to describe the genre that had given that traditional old tired, gentlemanly and sentimental American one such a successful twist into life. Enio Morricone, man of musical magic, had been working in film for some five years but it was this one and recordings of his soundtrack that also shot him to fame and fortune all around the world. A position of such acclaim, of course, that last even to today. Many have written of the film itself and I will restrict myself to commenting on the high quality of cinematography, the determination to make every frame look good and to supplement these attractive images with many a close-up of the characterful individuals, chosen surely at least in part for those very faces. In conclusion I must mention the considerable length for a film with such a fairly simple storyline and say that although there may be a slight slowing towards the last part of the first half when we maybe think the whole film will be following one baddie after another for apprehension, 'dead or alive' we instead encounter Gian Maria Volonte and his men and from there on there is no looking back - that will be the task of the participants, for there will surely be at least one guy with a gun coming up behind, or over the roof, or out of the window. All accompanied by that instantly recognisable music, teasingly introduced bit by bit at first and finally as a suitably crescendo like accompaniment to the stylised mayhem of the macaroni western, as the Japanese would say."

gavin6942,"Apr 24, 2011",7/10,"Two bounty hunters with completely different intentions team up to track down a Western outlaw.This is probably the most unique music Ennio Morricone has made for spaghetti westerns. And the plot and characters are cool, with the train prophet and the bullet hat dance. It is nice to see Eastwood and Leone together again, with Lee Van Cleef in tow. This is a clear improvement over ""Fistful of Dollars"", in my opinion, and I think Lee VanCleef helps. He is underestimated. No matter what you say, he deserves more credit.And what is with the town named Agua Caliente? Really?"
umlaziking,"Aug 29, 2021",10/10,After watching my favourite movie of all time the good the bad and the ugly i was so hungry for more. This film right here is a masterpiece...the final duel in the end was not only brilliany bit was definitely one of the best final duels I have ever seen. Just watch this movie...i swear to you...you wont be disappointed.
GregTheStopSign95,"Sep 11, 2024",7/10,"An improvement on the first, that's for sure. It'd want to be, though, considering the first one wasn't great.It still suffers from the ADR issues of the precious one, where the dubbing doesn't even remotely match the mouth movements of the non-English speaking cast, but at least they kinda fixed it for Clint's character? I think?On that issue though - the whole thing with Clint's character - I don't get how this is supposed to be the second movie in the Dollars trilogy considering Clint isn't even playing the same character as in the first movie, but he's supposedly the same guy in this and the next?At least the story and action are decent, though."
imseeg,"Feb 20, 2023",5/10,"This Sergio Leone western hasnt aged well. Why?The bad: the action shootouts are plain silly and almost childish. It's like kids used to play cowboys, that's the way the shootouts look, rather ridiculous. And this matters because there are LOTS of SILLY shootouts throughout the entire movie. Incredilby annoying and UNavoidable.More bad: the bad guys arent impressive. That's a real bummer. What's a western without really mean bad guys?Even more bad: the audio isnt synchronized. All the dialogues are added later on, with a terrible MONO sound and out of sync.Not any good then? Although this western is highly overrated Clint Eastwood is still kinda cool, calm and collected. But kinda silly as well, because everything about this western is kinda silly and cheap looking.This movie was nothing more than a prelude to the TRULY MAJESTICAL AND LEGENDARY CLASSICS called ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" and ""The Good The Bad and The Ugly"". Simply watch those TREMENDOUS classics by the very same legendary director Sergio Leone, instead of this silly surrogate of a western called ""For a few dollars more""...."

gbill-74877,"Nov 14, 2021",9/10,"The soundtrack from Ennio Morricone truly elevates everything that Sergio Leone put on film, giving this Western an epic, mythological feel. It's a story of two bounty hunters who, after some mutual animosity, decide to team up to pursue a dangerous bank robber and his gang. That sounds simple enough, but there are twists along the way, as well as a wonderfully gradual reveal of the backstory. Everyone is tough as nails which makes for some badass gun battles, but there are also little moments of levity sprinkled in, none of which felt like filler, and the storytelling is tight over all 132 minutes. It's also perfectly cast with the principals (Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef, Gian Maria Volonté), and on down the line (including Klaus Kinski). There is a poetry to all the machismo, and emotional depth to the violence, something I liked. Just a great film."
Kevbo-7,"Feb 28, 2001",9/10,"I saw this movie along time ago when I was just a little kid and I thought it was boring compared to The Good the Bad and the Ugly. But I decided to watch it again a few weeks ago and I dont know what I was thinking. The movie is a masterpiece ( as gritty as it may seem ). The movie far outshines most of American westerns. Lee Van Cleef is great as veteran bounty killer and the same goes to Clint Eastwood. Gian Volante puts up a good performance as the evil Indio. The plot is a little slow but look at ""High Noon"" or any of the other old westerns. My point being is that they're all slow and this one moves fast compared to the rest. An all time great western!!"
Habibi-Universe,"Oct 4, 2020",9/10,"Sergio Leone's 'For a Few Dollars More' (1965) is the sequel to 'A Fistful of Dollars' (1964) and marks the second film in the 'Dollar' trilogy. This classic Western is about the two bounty hunters, Manco (Clint Eastwood) and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), chasing the Western outlaw El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè).Greatness!
This has been my 3rd viewing of the film within just 3 months. Why, you might ask yourself? Because the film is so incredibly great and rewatchable! I remember when I watched the film for the first time, I laughed out loud and started clapping multiple times since this film has so many undeniably awesome moments! I don't know why this movie doesn't get the deserved attention from so many people. The problem might very well be that this film stands in the shadow of its iconic follow-up 'The Good, The Bad and the Ugly' (1966)!Having said that, 'For a Few Dollars More' absolutely needs to be talked about much more often!
This motion picture has a great script and a great story overall. Sergio Leone's execution of this film is also astounding!
I don't know how you execute this story so well, but somehow Leone did it!With a runtime of 132 minutes, this picture could have totally felt overly long and dragged out, but thanks to the fantastic editing and pacing of the film as well as the genius storytelling, it never gets boring whatsoever!Here we have Clint Eastwood, whose work (including his Western work) I am very familiar with, Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volontè who I need to watch more movies of.
Clint Eastwood loves that cigar in his mouth, it's iconic and I love it! It never gets tired seeing him with a cigar during a close-up! He has completely mastered the look of a Western hero! His costume as well as his entire look are just pure greatness!
Lee Van Cleef plays this older bounty hunter with a lot of experience and also a fair amount of knowledge. Him and Eastwood have this super cool back and forth with each other!
Gian Maria Volontè plays the villain El Indio who has an awesome theme music and a great backstory tying all the different dots and characters together. It all makes sense at the end of the day!Speaking of El Indio's theme, ENNIO MORRICONE, the genius, the mastermind composer, did an extraordinary job with the soundtrack! All of these songs are beautiful to listen to and have so much meaning that they actually elevate the story further, in a way musical pieces rarely ever do (unless they're in a musical)! The Leone-Morricone duo is iconic and unbeatable! My favorite piece is listening to the BEAUTIFUL chimes!Overall, 'For a Few Dollars More' is one of my favorite and one of the best movies of all time! I love this film and no matter how many times I watch it, I never ever get tired of it! The final 10 minutes of this film might be the best final 10 minutes I have ever seen in any film, especially when you watch the film for the first time due to the surprise factor!
I will forever be grateful to Ennio Morricone as well as Sergio Leone for their undeniably great contributions to the world of movies! 9/10"
john2000,"Jan 20, 2001",N/A,"This film has to be the best Western ever made. The hard, often brutal lifestyle of the those who lived and worked in the days of the 'Wild West' is brilliantly portrayed in this film. It is ironic perhaps that this film was made by outsiders, ie non-Americans. Up until the 'spaghetti westerns', American made films of this period, tended to put too much gloss on the film, portraying like as hard work but at the same time, romantic and cosy. Sergio Leonne with a neutral and rational frame of mind, directs the film with the truth slant that this historic period deserves. The best of the 'Spaghetti' series, (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) is rather too slowly paced, 'A Fistful of Dollars' will be as entertaining in 50 years time as it is now."
schmittfalte,"Aug 3, 2024",6/10,"**Review of ""For a Few Dollars More"" by Sergio Leone**""For a Few Dollars More,"" the second installment in Sergio Leone's iconic ""Dollars Trilogy,"" is a solid spaghetti western that, while better than its predecessor ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" doesn't quite reach the heights of the series' finale, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly.""In this film, Clint Eastwood returns as the laconic Man with No Name, this time teaming up with Lee Van Cleef's character, Colonel Douglas Mortimer. Together, they hunt down the ruthless bandit leader El Indio, played with chilling intensity by Gian Maria Volonté. The chemistry between Eastwood and Van Cleef adds a compelling dynamic to the story, with Van Cleef's performance being a particular highlight. His portrayal of Mortimer as a driven, haunted man adds depth and a hint of tragedy to the film.Leone's direction is, as always, masterful. His use of wide shots to capture the vastness of the American West, paired with Ennio Morricone's unforgettable score, creates an atmosphere that's both epic and intimate. The film's climactic showdown, with its operatic tension and meticulous build-up, is a testament to Leone's skill in crafting memorable cinematic moments.However, ""For a Few Dollars More"" suffers from some of the same issues as its predecessor. The pacing can be uneven, with certain scenes dragging on longer than necessary. Additionally, while the film improves on the first in terms of character development and narrative complexity, it still lacks the richness and moral ambiguity that make ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" a masterpiece.One notable aspect of the film is its portrayal of the Wild West as a place devoid of dignity and honor. The characters are often driven by greed, revenge, or desperation, which, while realistic, can make for a rather bleak viewing experience. This lack of nobility among the characters might be off-putting to some viewers, but it also adds to the gritty, unvarnished portrayal of the frontier.Overall, while ""For a Few Dollars More"" is an improvement over ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" it falls short of the brilliance of ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" Its strengths lie in its performances, direction, and music, but it is hampered by pacing issues and a somewhat unengaging narrative. For these reasons, I rate it a 6 out of 10. It's worth watching for fans of the genre and those interested in Leone's work, but if you only have time for one film from the trilogy, ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"" is the one to see."
michaelRokeefe,"Dec 9, 2005",8/10,"A FEW DOLLARS MORE is the second installment in the famous Sergio Leone trilogy. Plenty of gun-play with that trademark echo gun shot sound. The eerie and haunting musical score of Ennio Morricone keeps this ruthless western running for two hours and ten minutes. This unique sound will become evocative of the ""spaghetti western"" genre. Shootouts, stare-downs and relentless fist fights are plentiful. Monco(Clint Eastwood)and Col. Douglas Mortimer(Lee Van Cleef) are bounty hunters that try to out-wit the other in tracking down and turning in 'dead or alive' the ruthless villain Indio(Gian Maria Volonte). The finale is drama to the extreme as Mortimer and Indio have a showdown to the tune of the chimes of their pocket watches. Indio and his gang prove to be a fortune for the successful bounty hunter. Also in the cast: Luigi Pistilli, Benito Stefanelli, Rosemary Dexter and Lorenzo Robledo.Question: why does the 'man with no name' actually have a name?"
daddysarm,"Sep 25, 2020",7/10,"He matches Clint trigger-pull for trigger-pull and sneer for sneer. The first half-plus-some of FaFDM is a ""9"". Great lines. Great characters. Enough ""action"". It goes downhill when Indio gets more lines, because I couldn't understand maybe 1/3rd of what he said. Then it goes downhill further when Clint is seen looking for all the world like he is wearing combat charcoal on his face but then the lights go on & ""Poof"" it is gone. Then goes downhill more when Indio has his idea for a twisty scheme and the whole thing gets kind of ridiculous and the extended shootouts begin and the easy-to-foretell ""reveal"" is finally revealed.

hcl,"Feb 17, 2001",9/10,"Hardly a sentimental note to the whole film. About a criminal ""Indio"" and two bounty hunters who pursue him. One is revealed to have a very personal interest in killing this particular criminal (i.e. revenge).There is very little sentimentality in this; however this does not detract from it being a very very entertaining and fun. In my opinion it is the best of the Sergio Leone films (""The Good, The Bad and the Ugly"" grates a little on re-viewing; ""A fistful of dollars"" is too claustrophobic (script-wise) and predictable; ""A few dollars more"" has more scope, and a very mean attitude to boot). Unlike many other westerns that are highly rated on IMDB (aside from ""Once Upon a Time in the West"" which is also brilliant), this film is virtually purely focussed on the actions and inter-play of 3 intelligent and violent men; No romance, virtually no sentimentality, and great entertainment. Great Western. 9/10."
Darth_Osmosis,"Jun 2, 2018",10/10,"Not quite having the epic scope of ""Good, Bad and Ugly"" this is somewhat closer to a ""typical spaghetti western"".

There are lots of unbelievable scenes in this movie.They don't make movies like this anymore.Watch this or you'll be sorry."
fatehadli,"May 12, 2023",9/10,"The story begins with a scene in which Colonel Cole Douglas Mortimer appears carrying the Bible while the train man tries to check the passengers' tickets, referring the film director & writer of the story by that to the journey of life and the role of divine justice.Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and Monaco (Clint Eastwood) are bounty hunters. They both after (Gian Maria Volonté) Indio, a criminal and bank robber for his bounty. They decide to join forces againt Indio and his gang.The character of Eindo embodies the thirst for blood, treachery, envy, cunning, stealing and vanity, which are characteristics that represent the evil in human nature.At the beginning of the film, it seems to us that Colonel Mortimer and Monko are after Indio for money, only because they are both bounty hunters, but the events of the film prove the opposite.Indio's motives for murder and theft are still unknown, which makes him the most mysterious and complex character in the movie. Despite this, the actor succeeded in playing this difficult role, embodying the various emotions and psychological ills of the character.In contrast to the Joker, the evil man, who, despite this, enjoys wide sympathy from the public, the character of Indio remains an outcast who represents evil in its worst form."
umitbilber,"Jan 18, 2024",10/10,"Sergio Leone's ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" (For a Few Dollars More) is a gritty and iconic entry in the Spaghetti Western genre, known for its stylish direction, memorable characters, and Ennio Morricone's evocative musical score. Released in 1965, this film stands as a testament to Leone's ability to elevate the genre to new heights.The film follows the exploits of two bounty hunters, Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef) and ""Man with No Name"" (Clint Eastwood), as they independently pursue a notorious outlaw named El Indio (Gian Maria Volontè). The narrative unfolds against the backdrop of a heist and a quest for revenge, creating a suspenseful and visually striking Western tale.Leone's signature style is evident in every frame, from the expansive desert landscapes to the tight close-ups that intensify the tension between characters. The use of extreme close-ups, deliberate pacing, and silent anticipation builds a palpable atmosphere of impending conflict, showcasing Leone's mastery of visual storytelling.Clint Eastwood, reprising his role as the mysterious and stoic ""Man with No Name,"" delivers a performance that has become synonymous with the archetype of the spaghetti western anti-hero. Lee Van Cleef's portrayal of Colonel Mortimer adds depth to the film's dynamic, with both actors embodying their characters with charisma and grit.Ennio Morricone's musical score is nothing short of iconic, featuring the hauntingly beautiful theme ""For a Few Dollars More."" The score enhances the film's atmosphere, heightening the emotional impact of key moments and contributing to the overall cinematic experience.The screenplay, co-written by Leone along with Fulvio Morsella, Luciano Vincenzoni, and Sergio Donati, combines elements of revenge, greed, and honor, weaving a narrative that keeps the audience engaged from start to finish. The film's dialogue, while sparse at times, adds to the mystique of the characters and the world they inhabit.While ""For a Few Dollars More"" adheres to certain genre conventions, it also subverts expectations and introduces elements of moral ambiguity, a hallmark of Leone's storytelling. The film's exploration of the code of the bounty hunter and the pursuit of justice in the lawless West adds layers of complexity to its narrative.In conclusion, ""For a Few Dollars More"" is a classic Spaghetti Western that exemplifies Sergio Leone's directorial brilliance. With its captivating visuals, memorable characters, and a score that has become synonymous with the genre, it earns a rating of 9, signifying its status as an enduring masterpiece in the realm of Western cinema."
tfrizzell,"Aug 5, 2003",N/A,"The second film from Sergio Leone in his ""Nameless Man"" trilogy is probably my favorite of the three. Clint Eastwood returns as the mysterious drifter who is not exactly the nicest man on Earth. He is a bounty hunter after an escaped fugitive (Gian Maria Volonte, playing a different character from ""A Fistful of Dollars"") who has a devious plan to steal a bank safe. His band of outlaws are heartless and dangerous. Also along for the ride is bounty hunter supreme Lee Van Cleef who is after Volonte for reasons that are not only economic. In the end can Eastwood and Van Cleef co-exist or will they become enemies on the trail of Volonte? ""For a Few Dollars More"" is a little deeper than its predecessor and definitely better made. The plot is more believable and Eastwood gets a little more depth to his under-developed character here. Really no relation to the story in ""A Fistful of Dollars"" but still full of similarities. 4 stars out of 5."
RatedVforVinny,"Jan 14, 2020",10/10,"Rates up there with Sergio Corbucci's, own 'Django' and 'The Great Silence' as the finest Spaghetti Western ever produced. Sergio Leone, raised the bar level once again, as he produced one of the finest sequel, follow ups ever. Added to the stylized proceedings (this time) are Lee Van Cleef, and the real life crazy Klaus Kinsky (who both stared in countless other Italian Westerns). The music (once again) from Ennio Morricone, sounded so well crafted but edgy and using whips, whistles and mad animal sounds. Magnificent in every department of movie making and the U.S can't come close to matching it!"
CelluloidRehab,"Sep 20, 2004",9/10,"This was the follow up to A Fistful of Dollars. As with the other Sergio Leone spaghetti westerns, the elements of a great picture are there. The music ,done by Ennio Morricone, is exceptional. The cinematography is gritty and dirty. The plot and character development are the only loose points that could have made this movie truly great. Do no get me wrong, I love this movie. I do not like it as much as The Good, The Bad and the Ugly, A Fistful of Dollars, or Once Upon a Time in the West. The plot revolves around an outlaw named Indio and the 2 bounty hunters (Clint Eastwood's - The Man with No Name and Lee Van Cleef's Col. Mortimer) determined to get him. It is a revenge/greed motivated plot. Gian Maria Volonte plays the role of insane, paranoid and evil Indio to perfection. By far the best aspect of the movie is the soundtrack. The title track and the pocket watch theme are two of Morricone's best. My favorite scene of the movie would have to be the duel at the end. Classic. If you like spaghetti westerns, you should not miss this one."
elvircorhodzic,"Sep 16, 2017",9/10,"FOR A FEW DOLLARS MORE is a spaghetti Western film about two mysterious bounty hunter and a group of bandits led by a notorious murderer, rapist and robber. Mr. Leone has made again an exciting film full of a vivid violence, fistfights and shooting. He brings, through the relationship between the protagonist and mysterious flashbacks, an interesting combination between the danger, uncertainty and threat, which is a novelty in the genre.The two bounty hunter are separately introduced, while they hunt down and kill wanted outlaws to collect bounty. Meanwhile, a gang of outlaws breaks into a prison to free their leader, a clever, ruthless and psychotic ""El Indio"". The bounty hunters are interested in the large reward offered for the notorious fugitive and his group. None of them does not want competition in his work, though, they're hiding their true motives and join forces in their undertaking...In this film almost everything is done in a harmonious way, but an unpredictable and uncertain conflict between the three main characters is the biggest asset of this film. A fearless killing machine, an experienced and righteous colonel and an intelligent and ruthless madman guarantee an uncertain fun. An excellent direction and precisely arranged dynamics between a conversation, shots, violence and death enhance visual stimulation to the maximum. Therefore, a fiction has, through emotional and violent appearances, moral values and justifications, completely understandable context.The atmosphere is amazing, characterization is pretty good and the soundtrack is phenomenal.Clint Eastwood as Manco (the ""Man with No Name"") is somehow emotionally crippled and fearless killing machine. A harmonious movement, which corresponds very well with a change in his character at the end of the film are well designed. Mr. Eastwood has offered a convincing performance. Lee Van Cleef as Colonel Douglas Mortimer is an experienced character with a mysterious purpose. He was once a great soldier, now is a great bounty hunter. The revenge does not choose the means. Gian Maria Volontè as El Indio is simply brilliant in the role of a ruthless bandit. Klaus Kinski as Wild, the hunchback has drew my attention with his impatient mad expressions. A small role, but a very good performance.This is stylistically perfect film, which is well dovetailed between the original and the masterpiece."
davidmvining,"Nov 1, 2021",8/10,"The success of A Fistful of Dollars took everyone by surprise, and Sergio Leone, in order to claim his pending fee from his producers, agreed to make a follow up with Clint Eastwood returning. Writing very quickly, Leone and Luciano Vincenzoni banged out a new script and headed off into production. What they produced was much more naturally in line with Leone's style, creating a more cohesive overall film that has a more appropriate amount of plotting to fit.It is the story of two bounty hunters, Clint Eastwood's Manco and Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer, in pursuit of a noted criminal, newly escaped from prison, El Indio (Gian Volonte). And, that's kind of it. There is a plan around it that has some twists and turns, but it's a simple and bare story that takes a little over two hours to play out as opposed to the relatively overstuffed 90-minutes of the Leone's previous film.Much like A Fistful of Dollars, For a Few Dollars More is also a movie of great moments, but the simplified story allows the movement from one moment to the next to feel more natural and more of a whole. We're not getting a molehill of exposition to explain the conflict between the three main characters because it's overall a very easy to understand story underneath. Leone's films aren't exactly narrative freight trains, moving with utmost speed and efficiency from one plot point to another. They like to luxuriate in details, building up these great moments and letting them play out fully. They're really not the sort of thing I expect to see praised as some of the greatest films ever made because pacing is so important to so many people, and these movies move really slowly.Each of the three characters are introduced alone. Mortimer shows up in a town, grabs a handbill that details the $1,000 reward for a local outlaw, and proceeds to shoot him down in the street with a unique extra shoulder rest for his pistol. Manco shows up in another small town looking for a man wanted for $2,000 and proceeds to dispatch him as well as three of his men, hiding his gun wielding hand underneath his poncho for most of the action (including a tense little game of five card draw with the target, played one handed by Manco). El Indio breaks out of prison when his gang show up, killing all of the guards, and El Indio murders his cellmate, taking a small model of a liquor cabinet with him that the carpenter fellow prisoner had been making. All three end up going towards El Paso, home of the most stringently guarded bank in the area.Manco and Mortimer realize each other's presence and, after an amusing getting to know each other scene where they shoot their hats around in the middle of the night, they decide to team up with Manco working to get inside El Indio's gang with Mortimer (who insulted the hunchback played by Klaus Kinski and would be known) staying outside. One moment that really highlights the step in the right direction that this movie is compared to the previous film is how Manco rescues an errant member of the gang in prison in order to gain El Indio's trust. It just happens quickly and wordlessly. He finds out what he needs to do, he shows up placing a few sticks of dynamite just inside the cell's window, and then has a horse outside for the man to jump onto as soon as he's free. It's done in a few minutes with a bit of humor and a good amount of style.The overall objective is to whittle down El Indio's gang, taking the $10,000 bounty for him as well as the cumulative bounties for other members of the gang. So, when El Indio gives Manco the objective of going with three other members to a nearby town to rob that bank, Manco simply kills the three and then forces the telegraph operator to report a robbery that never happened. This triggers the robbery by El Indio, but El Indio hadn't shared his whole plan, managing to get away with the hidden safe from the bank while Manco and Mortimer wait on the wrong side of the town.Manco returns to the gang with a tale of being overwhelmed by the authorities (helped by a flesh wound Mortimer gives him to the next with a well-placed bullet), and the gang strikes out east to a remote little town to try and open the safe and wait for the heat to blow over. Mortimer joins them with the ability to open the safe without explosives, and we're set for the final showdown.Now, there's one element of this film that I don't think really connects, and it's the one emotional element. Mortimer's sister was murdered by El Indio some years ago, and the two share a pair of gold watches that each play the same tune, a matching set that Mortimer and his sister had held together. This ended up reminding me of Leone's similar effort at emotional payoff in Once Upon a Time in the West, that time around the character Harmonica. The information, in both cases, gets revealed late, really late, in the film, and it kind of dulls the seemingly intended impact of it all. It makes sense, but suddenly trying to gain some pathos in a film that's all about stylish gunplay pretty much from beginning to end doesn't really work all that well.Still, that stylishness is infectious. Combined with the more appropriately built story to match, For A Few Dollars More represents Leone really growing as a filmmaker, finding the groove of the kinds of stories he wanted to make and how he wanted to make them. It's an entertaining romp through the Old West as seen by an Italian in Spain, and it's a good old fashioned time at the movies."
dee.reid,"Nov 15, 2011",10/10,"""For a Few Dollars More"" is Italian director Sergio Leone's 1965 entry into his landmark ""Dollars trilogy"" of European-made ""spaghetti westerns"" and are arguably better than their big-studio American counterparts. Leone's ""spaghetti westerns"" are most memorable for turning star Clint Eastwood into a western icon overseas, while he was a Hollywood reject here in the United States (he was also starring at the time in the popular American TV series ""Rawhide"").""For a Few Dollars More"" is a better film than its 1964 predecessor ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" largely because it has better acting, better direction, better pacing, better Ennio Morricone film score, and is also a much more brutal and violent film than ""A Fistful of Dollars.""And Eastwood was certainly gaining speed as a movie star with his second outing as the anti-hero ""Man With No Name"" who does in fact have a name here, ""Manco."" As the ""Man With No Name,"" this time out Eastwood's a bounty hunter trying to capture the recently escaped convict Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang of hardened gunslingers.But unfortunately for him, the ""Man With No Name"" is not the only bounty hunter in town gunning for Indio and his boys. Another bounty hunter by the name of Colonel Douglas Mortimer (the late Lee Van Cleef) is also in town looking to collect the $10,000 bounty that's been put on Indio's head. The rival bounty hunters realize that because they're out-gunned 14-2 by Indio's gang, the only way to beat him is to team up and split the money right down the middle, which is something that is easier said than done.""For a Few Dollars More"" is a much bolder film than ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" largely because of its brutal violence and gritty realism. Leone was certainly starting to gain his footing as a director of almost limitless vision and ambition, and the willingness to take risks and try new things with each successive entry into his ""Dollars trilogy."" He again operates his camera to show the dry, oppressive desert-scape of the Old West as a place of murderous violence and not much respect for human life. It's a dark and dangerous vision of the Old West that rightfully earns its title as the ""Wild West""; it would be a long time before Hollywood would get the idea that the western genre was changing, and Sam Peckinpah's landmark bloodbath ""The Wild Bunch"" debuted in 1969 to challenge traditional movie standards of what can and can't be shown on the big screen.""For a Few Dollars More"" was followed by a third film, ""The Good, the Bad and the Ugly"" (1967), which brought Leone's landmark ""Dollars trilogy"" to an epic closer. Eastwood would also do a few more westerns himself over the years, but he would send it off brilliantly with his tragic anti-western ""Unforgiven"" in 1992.10/10"

TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"May 7, 2004",7/10,"Clint Eastwood is pretty much the king of westerns. And when the western is being directed by Sergio Leone, you know it good spaghetti-western entertainment. However, this one seemed a little repetitive and predictable. At times it seemed to repeat itself endlessly. Either talking or shooting, none of them moving the plot forward or getting any further with the movie. It just seemed to much like filler. The plot is OK, but seems too much like an excuse to put Clint and Lee Van Cleef in some scenes where they could show off their icy stares and their poker-faces. The acting is good enough for a western. The soundtrack is not as good as in ""The good, the bad and the ugly"", but almost. The action seemed a little too repetitive, and lacked the ingenuity of ""The good, the bad and the ugly"". Overall, a pretty good western, but just not as good as the next part of the trilogy(The good, the bad and the ugly). I haven't seen the first part, ""A fistful of dollars"" yet, but I'll see it as soon as I get a chance, so I can find out which part is the best. I recommend this movie to fans of spaghetti-westerns, Clint Eastwood and Sergio Leone. 7/10"
garyldibert,"Jul 17, 2012",2/10,"For a Few Dollars More (Italian: Per qualche dollaro in più) is a 1965 Italian spaghetti western film directed by Sergio Leone and starring Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volonté German actor Klaus Kinski also plays a supporting role as a secondary villain. The film was released in the United States in 1967 and is the second part of what is commonly known as the Dollars Trilogy.Summary: Eastwood (as the Man with No Name) and Van Cleef (as Colonel Douglas Mortimer and the ""Man in Black"") portray two bounty hunters in pursuit of ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volonté), one of the most wanted fugitives in the western territories, and his gang. Indio is a ruthless, intelligent man. He has a musical pocket watch that he plays before engaging in gun duels. ""When the chimes finish, begin,"" he says. Flashbacks reveal that the watch originates from a young woman (Rosemary Dexter), who killed herself while being raped by Indio after he had found her with her lover (in Joe Millard's novelization of the film, the young man is her newly-wed husband) and killed him. The watch bears a photo of the woman and was presented as a gift by the young man before being killed. Colonel Mortimer (Cleef) illegally stops a train in Tucumcari, and soon after collects a bounty of $1,000 on Guy Calloway (José Terrón). Mortimer's gun slinging skill is displayed as he easily kills him from long distance. After collecting the bounty, he inquires about Red ""Baby"" Cavanagh (José Marco), who has a $2,000 bounty, and was last seen in White Rocks. Mortimer is told that Cavanagh has already been targeted by Eastwood's character, who is referred to as ""Manco"" (meaning one-armed in Spanish — see below for an explanation). We see Manco ride into town and track down Cavanagh at a saloon playing five-card draw poker. Manco kills him and his men, and takes the bounty. Eventually, the two bounty hunters, after learning about each other from different sources, meet in El Paso and, after butting heads, decide to team up to take down Indio and his gang.Questions: What was so important about the bank in El Paso? Who was offered a membership? What was the membership to? Who recognizes the Colonel? Who is the Colonel? Where did the Colonel come from? Who was the Colonel's right hand man? What was Indio up to? Does anyone figure out what Indio was up to?My Thoughts: I like western films and I like Clint Eastwood films. However, this one was a waste of time! Clint Eastwoods talents were wasted in this movie. There was no theme to this picture. I lasted about ½ hour before I loss interest. The plot was simple and it didn't take long to figure it out. Usually when you watch a Clint Eastwood, it has you guessing until the end. This one didn't! Because of the lack of interest and because there was no leading lady I give this movie 2 weasel stars and that was beginning nice."
martinpersson97,"Apr 30, 2023",10/10,"Sergio Leone returns a year later with yet another western epic, again starring Clint Eastwood as the titular ""man with no name"" character, and again utilizing lots of actors from the first film.Is it quite as good as Fistfull of Dollars? I would have to say no, in fact, it is probably the weaker installment in the entire Dollar trilogy - but that is a very high bar, and doesn't take away from how much of a masterpiece this film is.Leone, accompined by the legendary Ennio Morricone's score, once again builds a memorable and incredible tale of the rough life in the west, utilizing lots of great cutting and editing and many of the long shot techniques that have since become standard for the genre.Overall, truly an incredible western that should definitely be experienced by any lover of film."
Tyler_R_Weston,"Jul 1, 2004",10/10,"Once again, Clint, you haven't let me down. For a Few Dollars More is a triumphant second installment to Sergio Leone's infamous, and by infamous I mean that in a great way, trilogy. This film proves to be just as entertaining as A Fistful of Dollars and yet For a Few Dollars More is a better film. There is plenty of gunfighting in this film and nobody can't be entertained by the wild showdowns that two partnered bounty hunters face on their journey to capture a lethal bandit named Indio. Once again, no words can describe how inspiring this film is. Unfortunately, I was only able to watch A Fistful of Dollars once, but now I am free to watch For a Few Dollars More over and over again. Clint Eastwood's portrayal as the Man with No Name proves to be superb and inspiring. A true western classic that no western fan, especially a Clint Eastwood one, should miss. I wouldn't have missed this film for the world and I am looking forward to watching the conclusion of Eastwood and Leone's infamous trilogy; The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, which I know will the most impressive of the three. Eastwood and Leone haven't let me down and they never will. Perhaps Eastwood's performance in westerns may still prove superb even without the assistance of Italian director Sergio Leone. But the two of them side by side help them film Eastwood's most classic westerns and above all, his most classic films of his career. Bravo, Eastwood. Bravo."
Mickey-2,"Apr 11, 1999",9/10,"""For A Few Dollars More"" is the second of the trio of westerns made in Italy starring Clint Eastwood and produced by Sergio Leone.  This film has Clint portraying a bounty hunter of the old school-no partners, all for me-who ends up joining forces with a mysterious man in black, Colonel Mortimer, played by Lee Van Cleef.  The two of them are hunting a vicious Mexican outlaw, El Indio, played by Gian Maria Volonte.  Each has a distinct reason for wanting to capture the bandit; Clint has $10,000 dollars bounty money in mind, while Van Cleef is simply wanting to extract a personal degree of revenge upon the bandit.In the course of the film, the two actually join the gang, help pull off a bank robbery, then spend the time plotting how to get the gang members bumped off and collect the bounties on a whole passel of bad guys. Ultimately, the final shootout does occur with Van Cleef and Volonte staring each other down and Eastwood awaiting the outcome.A rather violent view of the west, but then, the characters portrayed were rather violent men, interested in personal revenge or ""For A Few Dollars More.""  A film favorite for those fans of Clint Eastwood, and a 9/10 on my personal scale."
zzhhhqing,"May 17, 2020",9/10,"In this film, Dongmu may serve as the most handsome McGoffin in film history. The entanglement between the determined and courageous Van Cliff and the mad and desolate Volont is the focus; whether Leona as a screenwriter or director has tended Mature, personal style is thoroughly established: first use a few static close-ups of different scenes, and when the emotions accumulate to a critical point, a dynamic explosion is thrown out. This arrangement appears continuously, which is really an addiction."
eibon09,"Nov 9, 2000",N/A,"Per Qualche Dollaro in Piu/For a Few Dollars More(1965) is much better than Sergio Leone's previous outing of A Fistful of Dollars(1965), and longer in duration.  The first twenty minutes of For a Few Dollars More(1965) are well executed and one of the  genre's best opening moments.  The prison escape of Indio is done with great detail and precise filmmaking skill.  Unlike the last film, there is more importantance on the characters of the movie.  In the first dollar film, the gunfights were quick and short.  In this movie everything slows down while a duel is about to commence.Although Clint Eastwood is acknowledged as the star of the movie, its Lee Van Cleef to which the story puts the main focus on.  Lee Van Cleef plays a man whose out for revenge against Indio for a tragedy from the past.  The duel during the film's climatic moment is both intense and suspenseful.  In both For a Few Dollars More(1965) and Once Upon a Time in the West(1969), there is a tune from an object that represents something from the past. There are a few similarities between Lee Van Cleef's Colonel Mortimer and Franco Nero's Django.  As in Once Upon a Time in the West(1969), the use of flashback occurs in the picture at a critical moment.Sergio Leone really had improved as a filmmaker when you view For a Few Dollars More(1965).  Clint Eastwood shows a mysterious presence with his characterization of Monco.  Ennio Morricone conducts a score of excellent quality with a haunting melody from the pocket watch.  Klaus Kinski gives a stand out performance in basically a short role.  Lee Van Cleef portrays a man of experience and maturity.  The director's assistant directors were two guys who were later become big names during the 1970's named Fernando Di Leo and Tonino Valerii."
grahamsj3,"Feb 2, 2004",7/10,"Clint Eastwood made several of these Italian westerns and they made him famous. His acting in the first was terrible, but it's actually better in this film. I believe the presence of a ""known"", Lee Van Cleef, caused the acting in this one to be a vast improvement over the first film. The score still stinks, but at least the acting is better in this, his second spaghetti western. Overall, a career improver for Clint Eastwood. Can't say it did much for Lee Van Cleef and his career."
RonellSowes,"Apr 23, 2023",5/10,"Sergio Leone, certainly in this film, and in general save The Good the Bad and the Ugly, is at his best with a scene. Meaning, over the course of his excessively drawn out films there's a few flashes of his creativity that work while most of it just grinds you down with tedium. Its certainly a style, and I suppose you can give points for care because there doesn't appear to be a frame that isn't given the utmost intention; Leone treats each one like it's the most important shot in the movie. But theres so many great, precious scenes we're drowning in them. Even if you try and give yourself to it and soak it in I think you will eventually be worn out. Somewhere buried in this film is a more concise, energetic movie that frankly would be more watchable. However, how it stands Morricone is almost like a second director with his score, Clint Eastwood is of course by far the best thing going for it and he has a particularly good chemistry with Lee Van Cleef."
richardchatten,"Sep 8, 2022",9/10,"Human life is once again held extremely cheap in this sequel that actually improves on the original, since far more money has evidently been spent on it, Eastward's performance is more nuanced, Lee Van Cleef has joined the cast and a much more monumental score has been written by Ennio Morricone. It also contains an incredible early performance as a wild-eyed hunchback by Klaus Kinski that Morricone (usually famously laid back) startled everyone when he first viewed the film when burst out laughing at Kinski's acting; although the most memorable performance is probably given by Gian Maria Volonte's musical pocket watch."
Movie_Muse_Reviews,"May 24, 2017",9/10,"In ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" Sergio Leone took an Akira Kurosawa movie and used it as blueprint for his Western-themed playground, breaking all the rules and establishing new tropes for the genre. For a sequel that was reluctantly whipped up in short order, ""For a Few Dollars More"" demonstrates notable growth for the filmmaker.There's a lot more breadth and debatably even depth to ""Few Dollars More."" Clint Eastwood's Joe was the only interesting thing on screen in ""Fistful,"" but in this film, Monco, as he's called, might not even be the best character.Lee Van Cleef takes a co-starring role as Col. Douglas Mortimer, a sharp-shooting bounty hunter like Manco who becomes entangled with our other anti-hero when the two pursue the high bounty on El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte), a notorious gang leader and criminal who has been broken out of prison. Monco and Mortimer strike a deal when they realize they stand more to gain by collaborating than by getting in each other's way. They both suspect that Indio and his gang will rob the supposedly impenetrable bank in El Paso and connive to thwart their plan from the inside.Van Cleef isn't a scene-stealer, but he carries himself behind a greater shroud of mystery than Eastwood, who has already shown us all his moves, at least as The Man with No Name. The script gives him all the same tricks, but we can't be sure what to expect of Mortimer, which Van Cleef leverages to his advantage.El Indio is also much more of a menacing presence than anything we got in ""Fistful,"" which substituted the classic villain for a mélange of despicable characters, The Man with No Name included. Volonte starred as one of those shallow, unmemorable outlaws, and his turn as El Indio makes you doubt whether this is the same actor.The writing (Luciano Vincenzoni) makes a difference. El Indio is a colorful villain with a sinister yet human component giving him more dimensions. The touch of the musical pocket watch that haunts his enemies or anyone he wishes to stand against yet also haunts him shows a level of sophistication that's almost unexpected for a Spaghetti Western. ""Few Dollars More"" might not have the best one- liners of the trilogy, but the plot holds more weight.Tension is a hallmark of ""Few Dollars More"" that ""Fistful"" is largely missing. The impending showdown between Monco, Mortimer and El Indio holds a lot of promise. We've seen what all sides are capable of in compelling ways. A more telling sign of this difference is that ""Fistful"" has twice the death toll of ""Few Dollars More"" yet in the latter, Leone really makes the body count, well, count. Both are ""shoot 'em up"" movies that emphasize genre thrills, but this movie is distinctly more dramatic.As a director, Leone is a little more creative in ""Fistful,"" but sometimes to the movie's detriment. ""Few Dollars More"" is a little more by the numbers, but Leone seems to have a better read on what the best shot is in any given scenario to evoke the desired response in the viewer. He knows what was cool and sleek about ""Fistful"" and leans more on that in this movie. There's something breathtaking about the way he does close-ups that has so few equals in all of cinematic history, especially in genre films.You can't end a Leone review without talking about composer Ennio Morricone and honestly, the sound mixing in general. The themes Morricone gives to each character and the way he melds them into the more complex compositions has more to do with the enjoyment of Leone's films than you would initially give it credit for. He does rollicking theme music as expertly as he does the more intimate, suspenseful moments. Mixed together with prolific gunshots, galloping and more, so much of the live and style of these movies supports itself on a bed of exciting sound.As ""Fistful"" did, ""Few Dollars More"" has plenty of throwaway moments and parts that are shallow and uninteresting, but the style is one all of its own and Leone deserves continued celebration for the way his movies rewrote the essentials of the Western formula.~Steven CThanks for reading!

SAMTHEBESTEST,"Apr 9, 2020",8/10,"Short Review :-Watched For A Few Dollars More (1965)The first ever Spaghetti western classic came into my watchlist and i am in Awe now... A hardcore violent film that has tough machoism and lots of bullets firing frontloaded in it. For a Few Dollars More is an influential film and it has sure left so many references to so many typical action and masala oriented films around the globe. Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef as toughest heroes in lead roles outshine each other in every next frame and this who's best fight created a cinematic experience of Machoism. The film doesn't have any actress in lead role and that's why it never include any romance or crying stuff, rather it has a diabolical villain to make you fall for him. Gian Maria Volonte as Indio showcases a strong villain against tough guys and somehow this face off seems lovely. Sergio Leone in director's shoes keeps the phenomena alive with almost zero loo breaks and without spoiling a tempor for a moment. Overall, For A Few Dollars More is an authentic watch for western lovers and unexpectedly it is entertaining, you know what i mean, right.

Boba_Fett1138,"Nov 12, 2007",8/10,"This is a typical Sergio Leone western, with a style that made the spaghetti western one of THE genres of the '60's and redefined the western genre in general. ""Per qualche dollaro in più"" is the middle movie of the 'Dollar'-trilogy and although its not the best out of the trilogy it's of course still better than just your average kind of western!It's a movie that's solidly written, with also some fine solid characters in it. But it of course is the directing and story-telling style of Sergio Leone that makes the movie work out so well. He takes his time to build up sequences and its excitement. This movie is really not halve as action filled as you perhaps would expect but it still is at least halve more exciting than most other westerns with lots of action in it. This says something about the effective directing approach of Leone. Of course his trademarks elements such as extreme close-ups of eyes, flashbacks, slow storytelling, gritty atmosphere and stand-offs are all present here.Lee Van Cleef plays one of his very best roles. Gian Maria Volontè also did a really good job at playing the movie its real main villain, although of course I still prefer Eli Wallach. And Clint Eastwood does what he can do best in this movie; playing one tough but righteous character. It was also quite nice to see Klaus Kinski in this one!And of course you can't get around Ennio Morricone's musical score. Wasn't he one of the first ever composes to give each character a main theme and motive throughout the movie, that gets featured prominently? His score for this movie is just great and it above all really serves a purpose within the movie, which makes the score really suit the movie its story as well as the overall atmosphere.It's a movie that just gets better and better toward the ending, until it gets to its unavoidable stand-off sequence at the end, that is really exciting and memorable, once again not in the least thanks to Morricone's musical score, that actually plays a real important part during the sequence.In my opinion this movie gets nowhere close to the brilliance of ""Il Buono, il brutto, il cattivo"", which is the 'follow-up' of this movie and the last part of the trilogy, but that of course doesn't mean that this movie is a bad one! Not at all!8/10http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
Blaise_B,"Jan 19, 2003",N/A,"This film is mad, tongue in cheek fun that borders on ""Blue Velvet"" style depravity when it's not reveling in its exaggerations of the genre. The villain Indio, who has to smoke a cigarette lit by someone else after he kills someone because he's so aroused by death that he can't function properly is what first made me love the actor Gian Maria Volonte. Despicable and unclean, you bet! The obligatory showdown/bonding scene between Eastwood and Van Cleef is the best of its type ever filmed. This, of all the Leone westerns, is just the most out and out fun. It's mad, evil fun. The score is exceptional even for Morricone, the direction, editing, writing, acting...everyone's at the top of their game. It features Klaus Kinski's best performance in a western, even topping ""The Great Silence,"" even though he only figures in two scenes. Lee Van Cleef's line: ""Why should a man who carries a gun allow himself to be insulted?"" perfectly conveys the warped logic of this brilliant joy-ride through the world of European comic books from hell with pictures that move."

And this 1965 movie was one that I also never had seen before. I know it is odd, but I never really were much into Westerns.And as with many of the other Westerns that Clint Eastwood have been starring in, then I had certainly been missing out on an entertaining movie experience. Writers Sergio Leone, Fulvio Morsella, Luciano Vincenzoni, Enzo Dell'Aquila and Enzo Dell'Aquila definitely managed to put together a wholesome Western story here, as the movie had a lot to offer.""For a Few Dollars More"" felt and looked like a proper Western, much akin to the numerous other Westerns that Clint Eastwood have been in. So if you enjoy these Westerns, then you most certainly will also enjoy ""For a Few Dollars More"".This movie had a good cast list, with the likes of Clint Eastwood, Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volontè. This being a trio that you see together in other movies as well, for better or worse. Sure, they were good actors and brought a lot to the movie, but them being in the same movies numerous times portraying very similar characters in every movie didn't really sit all that well with me.The sounds when they were firing pistols and rifles was a bit over the top, with the ricocheting sounds, even when shooting at a hat in the air where there were nothing for the bullet to ricochet off. So that whistling sound over and over quickly grew tiresome.The movie was great in atmosphere and presentations, because it looked and felt like a proper Western movie through and through.""For a Few Dollars More"" is a Western movie that you have to sit down and watch, if you get the chance, because this is definitely on the Clint Eastwood classics.My rating of ""For a Few Dollars More"" lands on a seven out of ten stars."

The three memorable main characters combined with Leone's exuberant style and Morricone's epic soundtrack manage to give new life to what could have been the usual pastiche of western stereotypes.

magpie-5,"Dec 28, 1998",N/A,"The second in the 'dollars' trilogy is by far a better movie than 'A Fistful of Dollars'  The story about two bounty killers forming a partnership to catch a bandit may sound run of the mill but the performances of the actors and the direction as well as the music make this film a superb cinematic experience.  The film involves one of the bounty killers (Eastwood) infiltrating the band of desperadoes in order to get their hands on the bounty on their heads while the other bounty killer (Van Cleef) follows his every move just in case he decides to leave him out of there 'deal'.  What follows is a series of bank holdups, jailbreaks and the film climaxes with a stand off between the bounty killers and the evil bandit Indio.  Two scenes to watch out for are the match striking scene with the hunchback and when the Bounty killers first meet face to face.  This film is a must see for all Western fans."

After seeing both of them demonstrate their skills, we meet the arch-villain El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté), with countless other evil hombres.El Indio is a psychopath leading a gang of psychopaths, as demonstrated multiple times with laughter during cruelty. Manco and the Colonel reluctantly agree to work together, with Manco inserting himself into the gang. The major target is the Bank of El Paso, thought to be impenetrable. We learn that the Colonel has some additional motives in catching El Indio.""For a Few Dollars More"" is all style, with an unbelievable plot. All the Sergio Leone cinematic techniques are there, with many sweaty facial closeups. The musical score echoes ""A Fistful of Dollars."" The El Paso buildings seem later than the 1870s, and artificially labelled. A lot of quirky characters show up, but are never developed. Eastwood's persona, a stare with a smoke in his lips, is omnipresent. Lee Van Cleef is a good match for Eastwood.""For a Few Dollars More"" is more polished than ""A Fistful of Dollars,"" but the over-the-top storyline limits its potential."

I think this is even better than GBU in many respects. The smaller more personal vendetta has real human emotion to it. Van Cleef and Eastwoods tenuous bond is another highlight. Leones direction is again brilliant in the detail it brings to situations. What other film has Lee Van Cleef, Clint Eastwood and Klaus Kinski in the same scene!! Morricone delivers another fantastic score. The final duel with the musical watch is sheer magic. Glad this finally made into the top 250."

This most certainly ain't a film about trust - it's about greed, pure and simple and is great! It's a bit of a slow burn - nothing happens very quickly, but that all adds bundles to the atmosphere and tension of the story. That said, it sure isn't dull: there is still plenty of gun fighting, fisticuffs and general nastiness as well as some clever, black, humour and a wonderfully evocative score from Ennio Morricone that gets us to the inevitable series of single, double and even triple crosses. I don't think it has quite the menace or grittiness of ""A Fistful of Dollars"" (1964) but it's is still a tautly directed, character-driven western with a plot riddled with twists."

Both of had their special style unique which is somehow rare today. Must watch this when you love Western epics. Plot has been quite gripping. Clint Eastwood being young in those times gave a marvelous look. His way of walk and talk is really unique. Even in this age the way sometimes he gives a glance he looks like the same 40-50 years back clint eastwood.

This is classic filmmaking and I'm glad that I gave all 3 movies a try instead did just skipping to The Good the Bad and the Ugly. It will be a sad day when Clint Eastwood passes on but he will always remain a legend in the world of movies and rightfully so. Good directing from Serio Leone as well!"
markovd111,"Jul 29, 2025",10/10,"Freed from the narrative shackles of remaking ""Yojimbo"" and having triple the budget of the first movie, the sequel builds upon the success of the first movie in every way possible. Clint Eastwood is back and joined by Lee Van Cleef, and the levels of auras of their characters are on a wild level in this movie, and their rivalry/bromance is the stuff of legends! Gian Maria Volonté is also back as the main villain and once again provides an excellent performance!Add to this the majestic music, once again by maestro Ennio Morricone, without whom these movies wouldn't be what they are, and the signature style of Sergio Leone (loads and loads of it), and an interesting plot, and you have yourself another portion of excellence! Seriously, if you liked the first movie, you will feel right at home here.So, what are you waiting for? Sit down, ignore the crowd at the side telling you these movies are highly unrealistic and over the top (because they are completely missing the point), and relax and let yourself be transported into this specific vision of the Wild West and rest. Rest, my good man. You've earned it!"
wijajo-72563,"Apr 20, 2025",8/10,"For a Few Dollars More has huge similarities with it's prequel, A Fistful of Dollars, even down to recycling the actors of the dead villains in different roles. Similarity isn't a bad thing - Sergio Leone's formula of suspense, punchy action, beautiful cinematography and Ennio Morricone's haunting scores is a winning combination. And like its prequel, it's an engaging Western action that oozes style.In our sequel, we meet Colonel Mortimer (Van Cleef), a bounty hunter who attempts to upstage our prior hero, 'The Man With No Name' (Clint Eastwood). The presence of a third party, a possible second hero or villain, is a great plot ploy that helps to build mystery early on.I found it a very enjoyable and engaging watch. While I enjoy all of Sergio Leone's Westerns, I, perhaps heretically, prefer A Fistful of Dollars to A Few Dollars More. The former requires a little less suspension of belief in terms of believing the greatness of our heroes' premonition-like cunning and gun-slinging ability, and the goons seem slightly less helpless. While this occasional silliness has stopped me giving higher marks, it is nonetheless a fabulous film."
ktangney-56206,"Jun 4, 2025",10/10,"Sooner or later, when you're discussing all-time great films, you MUST talk about the Man With No Name Trilogy! In his genius, Leone begins all 3 films with an extended period of zero dialog, letting the wasted landscape & the single, silent human moving through this wasteland do all the talking.As a masterstroke, Leone has the imposing Lee Van Kleef dominate the screen for the first several minutes of the movie. And what are all the viewers waiting for? The inevitable entrance of the Man With No Name. And sure enough, into the frame comes the great Clint Eastwood!""For A Few Dollars More"" is about 2 competing, keen, quick-witted bounty hunters hot on the trail of a murderous outlaw, Indio, an arch-villain.Will one bounty hunter outdo the other? Or will they perhaps agree to team up? You'll have to watch the movie to find out!There are some shots when both Eastwood & Van Kleef are in the frame at the same time, and their combined screen presence is so formidable, this reviewer thought the screen was about to explode!This film is like Leone's use of a haunting, musical watch - it has to end sometime! Too bad it couldn't go on forever!10 out of 10 stars!"
francescoilaria,"Jul 4, 2002",N/A,"Sergio Leone has always made a particular ""cinema"". This movie is a exaltation of western world that he had in his imagination. In this movie we can find no order people but men that live their lives like heroes of a world lost. Good characters are only good, negative characters haven't anything of good. But everyone is a superman on the stage of a unreachable world. Unforgettable story, unforgettable characters, unforgettable musics.I love western. I love western ""spaghetti""."

hrssagas,"Jul 19, 2025",8/10,"Better in every aspect. Continuing the saga, we see the maturation of the idea of the Man with No Name.The first film, A Fistful of Dollars, succeeded in its action elements. In the sequel, these elements are maintained but expanded through the development of the plot, what is at stake, and the development of the characters.The characters are no longer one-dimensional; neither the villains nor the ""heroes"" exist merely to justify the shootouts. More than embodying the idea of the killer, they have distinct personality traits, and this time it is not only the reward that motivates them.It is through this development that Leone opens space for a narrative that balances action and story. With more screen time, the director uses this space to delve into narrative tools and give weight to the duels. Thus, the action scenes, already impressive before, generate much more tension in the viewer who now, besides following the protagonist, has additional reasons to root for his victory.The Colonel, who can be called the second protagonist or perhaps even the main one, was added to the plot precisely to humanize the Man with No Name. Both are bounty hunters who speak little, but when acting together, they create a certain kind of friendship or mutual respect, breaking the character's complete solitude.Here lies a crucial point: the protagonist is a man who speaks little and acts coldly, opposite to the impressionable common citizen. Thus, his interactions are generally limited to passive helpers. However, this logic is broken when interacting with someone who shares a similar moral code, as in the case of the Colonel, and with equivalent skills.Finally, the development of the plot also allows for greater significance in the use of the settings. Two men, waiting for the music to stop playing before exchanging shots, alternating between close-up and extreme wide shots, is, without other words, poetry.The pure evolution of Leone's Western."
NihadRogue,"Sep 22, 2025",7/10,"For a Few Dollars More is a classic spaghetti Western that continues the story of bounty hunters tracking dangerous outlaws in the Old West. Clint Eastwood returns as the Man with No Name, joined by Lee Van Cleef as another skilled bounty hunter. Their chemistry and contrasting personalities make the film engaging, and the story balances suspense, strategy, and action.The movie isn't flawless. Some viewers might find the pacing slower compared to modern Westerns, and a few plot points can feel predictable if you're familiar with the genre. Certain characters are archetypal and underdeveloped, focusing more on style and tension than deep emotional arcs.Still, For a Few Dollars More excels in style and execution. Ennio Morricone's iconic score elevates every scene, from tense showdowns to quieter moments, adding a timeless atmosphere. The duels and standoffs are cleverly staged, building suspense without relying on excessive action. Eastwood's stoic performance and Van Cleef's sharp presence create memorable on-screen dynamics. The cinematography captures the rugged landscapes beautifully, emphasizing both isolation and danger in the setting.Overall, For a Few Dollars More is a highly entertaining and stylish Western that stands the test of time. While the story may be simple and a few characters underdeveloped, the performances, music, and visual storytelling make it a classic of the genre. Fans of Westerns or Sergio Leone's work will likely find it captivating and satisfying.I wish the viewers a good time."
laurelhardy-12268,"Oct 25, 2024",9/10,"An 8.2 consensus. Just how cool is that?How many other guys (reviewers of this movie ), out there who (like me), gave this a high score; know a bunch of friends & family who would never score this so highly?I'm guessing a whole bunch.It's (You are) a special group of people. Others do not, and never will get it. And that's ok.Great reviews. Okay, my read on some of the facets of this movie:First & foremost, is the soundtrack.More to the point, the score. The mood & atmosphere permeates you to your core.Leone's soundtrack is as important as any other attribute of this film. It is mesmerizing to an extent I cannot possibly articulate. Even the treasured musical locket's tune. It's played so much, that if anybody else tried it, you'd be tempted to stop the movie due to annoyance. But with the Sergemeister doing it, the polar opposite. You're locked in. The locket, when opened, produces a very brief and oft repeated short combination of notes that is sweet yet yet infinitely sad in its minor key. Both the soundtrack and the Locket's tune, hold one prisoner, but in a delightful way.This is my favorite role for 'angel eyes'. Lee Van Cliff is actually allowed (in this movie), to have a degree of superiority over Clint's character, (as a pertains to shooting accuracy and draw quickness and General wisdom..)
Lee is the one with an axe to grind, and legitimately so to the nth degree.And being in the same profession as Eastwood's character, he has no sinister side to him.This adjunct to the primary plot, I believe, is what puts this movie over the top. You're pulling for Van Cleef's character throughout. And, he's classy here, driven by objectivity, but with a genuinely wounded heart.As it happens, I liked Clint Eastwood's character as well. It's 1965, when he was 35, but as far as making films, he was quite new to motion pictures.And what a way to make a living. Eh? Ya get to ride around on a beautiful horse all day, toking on a tipless Tiparillo, as you slay thieves & murderers.No wonder he's got all the girls!The other thing that makes this movie, really great, is the partnership that is created (and evolves) between Van Cleef, and Eastwood, both bounty hunters seeking the same prey.And lastly, I find it kind of entertaining, to quickly search WIKI in order to learn about all of these Italian actors. And What a trip it is.Antagonist El Indio (portrayed by. Gian Volente), kind of owns this movie in many ways. And he does a good job.Well, that's enough, thanks for listening!Bob R."

chaosHD,"Jul 14, 2008",8/10,"A Fistful of Dollars was merely the warm up, For a Few Dollars More quickly followed and raised the bar even further. Shot in 1965, but not released in the US until may of 1967, it was already the biggest box office hit in Italy's history by the time it was finally released here. Countless Italian westerns followed in For a Few Dollars More's wake, none of them came close to matching Sergio Leone's work.For a Few Dollars More has so many memorable shots and scenes that i'd be writing for days if i listed them all here. Personally i tend to refer to this one as ""the one where Lee Van Cleef lights a match using Klaus Kinski's neck"". Even though Eastwood gets top billing, he actually doesn't do a whole lot, instead he sits on the sidelines, giving most of the spotlight to Van Cleef. And in the climax, he literally does just that.Ennio Morricone's score is as classic as they come. Once you hear it, you remember it forever. I remember hearing my dad do the unforgettable whistling ""music"" from the film when i was a kid.For a Few Dollars More is quite simply one of the best westerns of all time. But then again, everyone already knows that. The best part of all, is that Sergio Leone was not done yet, he still wanted to raise the bar even further with a few more westerns."
Kademan-02092005,"Jan 21, 2025",8/10,"For a Few Dollars More sees the return of the surprise talents who brought the man with no name to life, both behind and in front of the camera. And now they bring you something new with the introduction of a new set of characters and equally engaging story.The acting and chemistry between Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, as Manco and Mortimer respectively, is excellent in their back-and-forth dry delivery of banter and competitive wit. Moreover, the step-up in budget is noticeable in the upgraded set design, with the inclusion of more modes of transportation, fancier establishments, and larger sets to fit it all together. Furthermore, The action is more or less the same but notably improved upon, and the plot itself is more simply set up with revelations in the back half of the runtime keeping things consistently interesting. And the soundtrack from Ennio Morricone somehow manages to outdo his previous work from A Fistful of Dollars in generating more excitement and tension out of every scene it supports.On the other hand, although the dubbing is noticeably better, it is still not great for most of the characters, with some lines of dialogue even creating difficulty in distinguishing between which character delivered it. And on a more personal gripe, the antagonist Indio, who is played very well by Gian Maria Volonté, fails to stand out as a memorable villain mostly due to his simplistic motivations and moreso feeling overshadowed by Eastwood and Van Cleef's powerhouse presences. But Volonté is very entertaining in the role, and he does get a very well-done scene closer to the end of the movie, granted as he's playing against Van Cleef.Overall, For a Few Dollars More is a big improvement from its already impressive predecessor, and still manages to find new ways to explore aspects of the Old West in a highly thrilling and fun fashion."
bernielane,"Nov 17, 2024",9/10,"This movie would be the greatest western of all time if Sergio Leone had bothered to give people bullet holes in their bodies when they get shot. Some even get shot at point blank range but not a single bullet hole or even a crease in the clothes in sight, I didn't think about it when I was a kid watching this movie but now when I do I just can't get past this obvious flaw in an otherwise perfect western. You can have a perfect script, perfect screenwriting, a perfect cast of stoic cleef out for family revenge and a dedicated to the bounty hunter cause Eastwood out to get the reward money for the sublime evil that is Indio but without bullet holes in the bodies it all seems a bit like a school play."
TeamReCare,"Apr 3, 2023",N/A,"Sergio Leone's 1965 spaghetti western is a cinematic masterpiece that still holds up today. Starring Clint Eastwood and Lee Van Cleef, the film is a classic tale of two bounty killers on the hunt for a notorious bandit.Leone's direction is outstanding, making use of inventive camera angles and extended takes that add depth to the story and heighten the tension. The film's score, composed by Ennio Morricone, is also exceptional, incorporating various musical instruments to create a distinct and unforgettable sound.Eastwood and Van Cleef deliver some of their best performances, with Eastwood's stoic coolness and Van Cleef's nuanced portrayal of a vengeful bounty hunter adding layers to their characters. The interactions between the two leads are a highlight, showing a unique camaraderie and mutual respect despite their initial rivalry.For its day, the film's pacing is tight, and the action sequences are exhilarating, making ""For a Few Dollars More"" a thrilling ride from start to finish. It's a western that perfectly captures the essence of the genre, complete with gunfights, horseback chases, and a climactic showdown.This a cinematic treasure that any fan of westerns should see. Its stylish direction, brilliant score, and strong performances make it a must-watch, and its influence on the genre is undeniable."
jake-law123,"Oct 15, 2011",7/10,"Beautiful sequel that greatly continues the Spaghetti westerns, starring the man himself once again, Clint Eastwood, or in this movie, Monco. A year later from a Fistful, fresh off and ready for more, Eastwood continues his amazing performances of gunning down bandits and being awesome as ever!The man with no name returns in this film as Monco, who forms an alliance with a bounty hunter named Douglas Mortimer, (Lee Van Cleef) to kill a bounty, along with his entire gang, and split the $10,000 prize between the two.Clever story combined with great characters, including the villains, make this a worthy sequel. Though it can tend to drag on just a tiny bit, and doesn't have as strong action as the other one did, though it is replaced with solid key build up moments, along with entertaining conflicts and situations. Clint and Lee make a great team. When one is in trouble, the other arrives just in time to save them.The film in general is just a big great sequel. It could maybe stand out as a film on its own. It doesn't have too many references to the first, but it still continues the legend of the man with no name, and continues to show us the awesomeness that is Clint Eastwood! Followed by The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."
Nitun_007,"Dec 30, 2024",8/10,"I don't have much experience with this genre, with this being second western I have watched. Overall, this was a nice film: the storytelling is awesome and the way it builds up tension in all the pistol duels is thrilling indeed.This film comes after the first film in the dollars trilogy: A fistful of dollars. We see the man with no name being introduced as a bounty hunter straight ahead. But he also meets another bounty hunter going after the same target. And well, their chemistry was really enjoyable to watch. A sense of mystery around the other guy adds to it.Apart from that the music deserves a special mention too, as it really uplifts each scene where the score kicks in."
KineticSeoul,"Oct 7, 2011",8/10,"The iconic western gunslinger is back and better than ever. Now this is a western that is very much worth the time to watch, in fact it's probably one of the most favorite western flick to most movie buffs that actually like western movies. This isn't a dry western either and it's a western that most audiences can enjoy, in fact I sort of found this sequel to be bit more entertaining, although it isn't really a sequel. It didn't have that classic feel to ""A Fistful of Dollars"" but it felt a bit more entertaining never the less. It's the least notorious when it comes to this trilogy but it still has it's rightful place in this trilogy. It's good to see a groundbreaking actor such as Clint Eastwood being in another great western movie such as this. The lone gunman is now a bounty hunter but the bounty isn't the only problem although the villain does stand out. But he also has to deal with a rival bounty hunter that is on the trail for the same bounty. And I must say Lee Van Cleef makes a pretty good rival. Anyways there is more to this story as it progresses just when you feel like you got down the main plot of this movie. This is a spaghetti western with some good storytelling and a entertaining one that will inspire other future movies to come. It's a old western that even the modern audiences can still enjoy and have a good time with, especially when it comes to audiences that enjoy western movies. Even most of the characters are interesting or adds something to this film. This movie is what true western is all about and yet it isn't dry but also entertaining. The gunfights are also one of the most awesome western gunfights in a film.8.5/10"
TheFearmakers,"Mar 14, 2025",8/10,"Sergio Leone's 'Man With No Name' or 'Dollars Trilogy' was mainly interpreted as such from the second movie's sustaining title, A FEW DOLLARS MORE, sounding as if Clint Eastwood's Joe character were returning after FISTFUL OF DOLLARS... but he's named Monco here, a resilient bounty-killer with initially reluctant partner Lee Van Cleef as older, more experienced and slightly superior sharp-shooting Col. Douglas Mortimer...The best scenes take place in the small town buildup before the screen-time's stretched twenty-minutes too far in holed-up, sparsely rural locales, where at one point Eastwood watches Cleef mentally-squaring off with the violently villainous gang, as if he too were hearing Ennio Morricone's tension-building score...Like its epic and superior followup THE GOOD, THE BAD AND THE UGLY, the comparably shorter DOLLARS MORE... although longer than FISTFUL... has the same main goal concerning a bundle of cash: here placed inside a carpenter's unique cabinet from the backstory of lead antagonist Gian Maria Volontè as El Indio, who, flanked by scruffy hunchback Klaus Kinski and Leoni regular Luigi Pistilli, goes into spooky hypnotic trances whenever making decisions...He's also haunted by surreal recurring backstory-flashbacks concerning a slain woman, with a climactic payoff concerning one of his two hunters... yet the three main characters often feel like part of different types of thrillers: Eastwood and Van Cleef game for a more gun-blasting-adventure while the uncompromisingly brooding Volontè leans into what's darkly art-house cerebral...The resulting combination mostly works in a narrowed hybrid of twisty heist flick and sprawling open-road-movie, where Clint Eastwood's more of a strategic referee than primary pawn, giving genre-favorite Lee Van Cleef slightly more leverage to the overall plot and theme...Ultimately making sense since Clint's the sole hero in FISTFUL while Eli Wallach's Tuco almost completely owns UGLY: flanking the resulting trilogy connected by style instead of characters - yet the main drive here's the director and composer, who had really found their ultimately groundbreaking, combined synergy."
mikavir,"Dec 13, 2021",10/10,"Sergio Leone's Dollars Trilogy is very impressive movie series. It's rare that the third part (The Good, the Bad and the Ugly) is the best part of the movie series. But the second part For a Few Dollars More is also glorious Western movie and better than the first part (A Fistful of Dollars). For a Few Dollars More is an immortal classic that takes its place among the best Western movies.A bounty hunter Manco (Eastwood) is mysterious man whose real name is unknown. His next target is a bank robber and escapee El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte) and his gang. El Indio is very violent and cold man and he uses a musical pocketwatch in duels. Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Van Cleef) who is also a bounty hunter wants to find the bank robbers more for personal reasons. Manco and Mortimer cooperate to reach their own goals.The movie is very exciting. Though it is quite long movie it isn't boring at all. The movie doesn't contain long lines but music is a significant part of the movie. Especially the sound of the pocketwatch is even magical. Without Morricone's soundtrack this movie wouldn't be as good as it is now. The main actors are very good especially Volonte. Characters are memorable and scenes are of high quality. You don't forget this movie if you have seen it. Leone's For a Few Dollars More is of the best quality for the Western movie fans. I recommend this also for friends of all kind of movies. 10/10."
inspectors71,"Feb 15, 2007",N/A,"Although For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark and inherent problems with Euro-Westerns (dubbing, locales, scenery-chewing, and everyone looking like they're from . . . Spain), I think it's the most emotionally satisfying of the Man With No Name trilogy. Clearly it's not an extension of A Fistful of Dollars, nor is it related to the biggest of the three, The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly, but it has its own independent story, and it's the most pleasing of the three movies on a thinking level.Here, Clint Eastwood is slightly eclipsed by Lee Van Cleef. They're both bounty hunters after the same criminal, but Van Cleef has personal issues with ""Indio"" while Eastwood just wants the cash. In the long run, we care more about Colonel Mortimer than Monco, and this gives FAFDM its unique quality, even if a ""quality spaghetti western"" is an oxymoron to you.Yet, Sergio Leone made Tuco in GBU more entertaining than Blondie. You want Blondie to get the gold, but not kill Tuco (although he sure deserves it!). By the end of FAFDM, you're rooting for the Van Cleef character; Eastwood is just a killing machine, much like his character in Where Eagles Dare. Whether or not this is what Leone wanted--or if he desired Van Cleef and Eastwood to be equals--I think most folks will have taken sides fairly early on.I didn't find this movie nearly as visually exciting as GBU and the preposterousness of some of the plotting and action may make you squirm or roll your eyes, but I recommend For a Few Dollars More because it's an emotionally satisfying western at its heart."
TheMan3051,"Aug 5, 2001",10/10,"Clint Eastwood continues his trademark role as the legendary ""Man with No Name"" in the sequel to ""A Fistful of Dollars"". The film is packed with gun-blazing action and high-noon tension. The film stars Clint Eastwood as a keen-eyed, quick witted bounty hunter on the bloody trail of Indio (Gian Maria Volonte), the territory`s most treacherous bandit. But his ruthless rival, Colonel Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef), is determined to bring Indio in first...dead or alive!"
Kubris,"Jun 9, 2011",7/10,"Top 250: 121For A Few Dollars More is the 'sequel' to Fistful of Dollars. This time, Clint teams up with Lee Van Cleef to take down some bandits and get rich. It's a simple story, but it works.Unfortunately, it doesn't all work. I'm sure it saved a lot of money, but you can't cast the same guy to play the same role in an ""unrelated"" movie. (I'm talking about the bad guy). After the end of Fistful, I spent the first half of this movie trying to figure out what the film's relations are. It's too confusing, especially when the characters are so similar.The next problem are the other characters. In Fistful, it was Clint versus the town, alone with only his wits and his gun. In Halo 2, I mean Few Dollars More, we have two badasses to root for. Unfortunately, in my opinion this lessens both of their likability, especially since it seems there's less shooting in this than Fistful, but that comes later. Both characters are well acted though, and Van Cleef's revolver is a monster. Also, the 'psychopathic' Indio isn't that crazy compared to other movie villains, and he only starts to show his craziness halfway through the film. Again, I complain about his casting choice and lack of effort to differentiate him from Fistful's Rojo.Lastly, the film's pacing is not good and it runs too long. Whereas Fistful starts with a tense stand off and maintained an active pace, Few Dollars More starts off far too slow and picks up too late. Once the robbery happened, I was engaged for the rest of the film, but it took too long to get there for a spaghetti western. The film, 2 hours 10 minutes long, could've had 10-15 minutes cut and still told the same story with the same amount of action.Few Dollars More is still a fun western, with good leads and a strong second half. But it can't match up to it's predecessor, a more concentrated and enjoyable movie. 7.2/10"

Particularly good is the scene where the two heroes meet, in which the mysterious character of Van Cleef and the charm of simplicity of Eastwood's character clash in an exciting standoff.In general, this movie is one of those extremely rare cases when the sequel not only remains at the level of the first series, but also to some extent surpasses it. It's really impressive how Leone managed to become even better with each next movie. I firmly believe that the dollars trilogy should be watched in the order of release, so that one could experience Leone's amazing progression as one of the best film directors in history."
Al_rock56,"Jul 10, 2002",9/10,"The story is very simple. But it's also cunningly told by director Leone. He makes this story about two bounty-hunters and a super-villain something special. Just watch the final shootout scene!The man with no name (Eastwood) is called Manco or Monco in this film. Obviously a made up name. Manco is italian, translates something like ""madman"" or ""rascal"" in english."
those_who_dig,"Nov 5, 2016",10/10,"Whilst most people believe that 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' is not only the best instalment of Sergio Leone's 'Dollars' trilogy but one of the greatest Westerns of all time, I've always preferred 'For a Few Dollars More'. One of the reasons for this is the display of talent. Lee Van Cleef and Gian Maria Volontè deliver great performances as Colonel Mortimer and El Indio, respectively. Volontè portrays his character with a level of complexity and expressiveness rarely seen in the Western genre, whilst Van Cleef is given a central part in the film's most memorable and entertaining scenes - the 'match-striking scene', the 'hat-shooting scene', and the inevitable standoff. Clint Eastwood's iconic character is always entertaining to watch, but I think the most meaningful moments in the film come from his reluctant ally (Van Cleef) and his enemy (Volontè). The technical aspects of this film are just as good as those in 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly'. Whilst some of the cinematography and of course the soundtrack in the third film are by far the most memorable, Leone's crew managed to create an appropriate visual and musical atmosphere for this darker, more brooding film. To conclude, I believe that this film draws closer to perfection than its more famous follow-up, using better pacing, excellent technical talent and outstanding performances to cement its place in the history of both the Western and cinema."

The plan is that Van Cleef will be the outside man, while Eastwood becomes a member of the gang. But while it works at first, Volontè figures out what's going on.Director Sergio Leone named this one for his producers' refusal to pay him for A FIST FULL OF DOLLARS until he made this. Nonetheless, he decided to make a good movie, and eventually settled on Van Cleef after other actors turned him down. It revived his career. More than that, it demonstrated that the first movie was no fluke. Not only was Eastwood confirmed as a star, and Leone as an international director, but it kept the western going as a distinctive, if violent genre for a few more years."

anton-6,"Oct 12, 2001",9/10,"Lee Van Cleef is as good as Clint Eastwood in this entertaining western film.Maybe the ""bad guy"" in this film: El Indio,is a bit to brutal but I think that this is as good as ""The good the bad and the ugly"".A really entertaining film with an excellent sound track.4,5 out of 5"
r96sk,"Jan 10, 2022",9/10,"I'd rank it slightly below the original, but that's unimportant as 'For a Few Dollars More' is still a lot of fun.Clint Eastwood is tremendous again as the lead character, while Gian Maria Volonté reappears as a different character - usually I'm not a fan of actors playing different characters in a series, but I must make an exception here as Volonté is terrific; just as he is in the preceding 1964 film. One newcomer to the cast is Lee Van Cleef, who is brilliant too.A story regarding bounty hunting was always going to be enjoyable, which is most definitely the case here. The aforementioned trio are massively entertaining. I particularly found the ending to be one of the best parts of this.I was excited to check out 'The Good, the Bad and the Ugly' even prior to watching the first two films, given it's the one I knew most of beforehand, but its two predecessors really have wet the appetite and then some!"
kevin_robbins,"Oct 1, 2021",9/10,"For a Few Dollars More (1965) is a movie in my DVD collection and is also available on Amazon Prime. The storyline follows two bounty hunters that seem to be tracking down the same outlaw and his gang. They cross paths and initially try to stay out of each others ways as they figure out each others motives and plans. Their paths eventually have to cross and they decide it is best to play off each others strengths so they can both achieve their mutually desired outcome. This movie is directed by Sergio Leone (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly) and stars Clint Eastwood (A Fistful of Dollars), Lee Van Cleef (Escape from New York), Gian Maria Volontè (A Fistful of Dollars) and Benito Stefanelli (The Good, The Bad and The Ugly). It is so hard to say which film is better, this or the first film. Lee Van Cleef is an absolutely awesome addition to this film but Eastwood was slightly cooler in the first film. The lines, dialogue and delivery in this film are excellent. There's great chemistry between characters in this picture. The shootouts, props and action sequences are awesome as you'd expect from a Leone film. The soundtrack is also remarkable. This is a near perfect picture with great depth and a fun ending. Overall, this is one of the top 10 spaghetti westerns all time that I would strongly recommend. I would score this a 9/10."
jameselliot-1,"Oct 12, 2004",N/A,"A previous commenter had noted: ""I often had to wonder about those shooting at clothes and leaving those clothes without holes in them, especially that bedroom scene when the guy got all shot up and looks like nothing had entered his body."" This scene takes place when Indio is remembering/fantasizing/reliving his rape of the Colonel's sister and his killing of her husband so it makes perfect dream-like, surreal logic that the reality of bullet holes doesn't occur in his hallucinatory flashbacks. Elsewhere Eastwood is called Manco by the sheriff paying off the Colonel for a bounty killing. I believe that when the dubbing script was translated from Italian to English, the slang word ""Manco,"" meaning left handed was kept in instead of being translated into English as ""Lefty."" In the Italian language version, Eastwood's name would be understood as Lefty."
krational66,"Apr 27, 2020",7/10,"1. Morricone's music, starting with electric guitar, wind bell and pocket watch (internal music to external), reveals the characters with progressive close-up and progressive intermittent flashbacks to enhance suspense. 2. Lionel's fondness for male companionship is like the natural understanding of a teenager playing a buddy game: boots on, hats on, ideas on. 3. Apple shooting and the child's point of view, which is changing silently when compared with marksmanship -- low position and far view. 4. The film is filled with a wave of nostalgia and sadness that is hard to give up."

TheUnknown837-1,"Dec 22, 2009",7/10,"""For a Few Dollars More"" is the second of three enormously successful Italian Westerns that Sergio Leone made with future superstar Clint Eastwood in the mid 1960s. The first was ""A Fistful of Dollars"", which though a hit and a good Western, was not original (it was later the subject of a successful lawsuit by Japanese filmmaker Akira Kurosawa who noticed it was very similar to his 1961 film ""Yojimbo"") and the third and best of the trilogy was ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", which has now reached icon status. The film in the middle? Well, it's the second-best. It's a little better than ""A Fistful of Dollars"", but is still just on the level of being good. It's a decent, entertaining matinée but how masterpiece like its successor.Eastwood returns again as a sneering, poncho-wearing gunfighter who has no name, now on the trail of a notorious bandit named El Indio (Gian Maria Volonté). While on his tracks, he teams up with another bounty hunter (Lee Van Cleef) whose reason for hunting Indio turns out to be more than the reward.Leone was a director who used the same cinematic styles and camera techniques over and over again. He used montages of close-ups, broad wide angles that remind you of scenes from ""Lawrence of Arabia"" (1962), very little dialogue. And you see all of that in ""For a Few Dollars More."" It's a very stylistic Western, but how does it fare on entertainment value? On the whole, I liked the movie. I wasn't bored, it kept moving, it didn't try to be anything more than what it was, and I enjoyed it. But on the other hand, it does pale in comparison to ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly."" But perhaps this is an unfair comparison, since very few films come even within range of being as good as the said Italian masterpiece.Although I didn't find it to be an incredible film-going experience, there was a lot to like. Eastwood and Van Cleef were well-cast in the roles of the two conniving bounty hunters and Gian Maria Volonté played another good villain. The movie also has a lot of action. It starts with a gunshot and ends with a gunshot and there is lot of gunfire in between. If you can't suspend disbelief or if you dislike movies that more or less glorify violence, you will not enjoy this movie, for Leone makes a very stylish portrayal with his gunfighters making clever remarks and performing fancy tricks as they gun down their opponents. The movie is also aided by a strong score by Ennio Morricone.Bottom line, like ""A Fistful of Dollars"", I thought it was a good Western, but not a great one. It passes the time exceptionally well, but it's not a movie that I find myself watching over and over again."
RodrigAndrisan,"Dec 3, 2017",10/10,"Have you ever been to Tucumcari? What about White Rocks? Maybe El Paso? Santa Cruz, Las Palmeras, Aguascalientes? You haven't even heard of these places? They are in Texas, New Mexico and Mexico! No problem, everything was filmed in Spain anyway. However, EL INDIO, a crazy and very dangerous bandit, is off to these localities and a $ 10,000 reward has been put on his head. At the end, Clint Eastwood, the only one who is still alive even today, is leaving with all the money. Just to have an idea... Now, we have a very young Klaus Kinski, in a small but great role, maybe his greatest. Then, we have a few long-term collaborators of Mr. Leone, some Italian, some Spanish, but all unique figures, faces you can not easily forget: Mario Brega, Luigi Pistilli, Aldo Sambrell, Benito Stefanelli (also stunt director), Enrique Santiago, Lorenzo Robledo. There is also the old and funny Joseph Egger, Austrian actor who had a similar role in ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Great cinematography by Massimo Dallamano, who worked with Leone also on ""A Fistful of Dollars"". Probably the most beautiful soundtrack ever written for a film, signed by the great Ennio Morricone. They should also be mentioned here: Bruno Nicolai (conductor), Alessandro Alessandroni, musician: whistling and guitar (uncredited), Bruno Battisti D'Amario, musician: guitar (uncredited), Nino Culasso, musician: trumpet (uncredited), Maurizio Graf, singer (uncredited). Last but not least, the 3 main actors, all three great great actors, unfortunately 2 of them, who are not anymore alive, unknown or completely forgotten. Everybody knows Clint Eastwood so, no need to comment on something. Lee Van Cleef was and remains a very special actor, unmistakable due to his face (especially his eagle nose) from many successful action films. And Gian Maria Volontè, few know this, so I will repeat it until I die, Gian Maria Volontè was and remains simply the greatest actor of all time!"
twolanebl,"Jan 30, 2003",9/10,"Great flick...from beginning to end. Tighter than The Good, The Bad, and The Ugly; Harder and more sophisticated than A Fistful Of Dollars: This is easily the best of the trilogy and is my favorite Western ever. Granted that I haven't seen much outside of these, other Clint Eastwoods, The Wild Bunch, John Wayne flicks, and a few others, but not much could top this one for me. Firstly, as always, the music from Ennio Morricone is beautiful. The action and cinematography are top-notch as always. The character of Col. Mortimer gives the movie more depth than Fistful, and the villain El Indio is top-notch. The final shootout is one of the best in the genre and the final shootout with the chimes makes me shiver. Then, to cap all things off, Clint Eastwood delivers one of the funniest endings ever when he's counting his booty. ***** out've *****"
dworldeater,"Aug 19, 2020",8/10,"I think, Fistful Of Dollars is the most iconic as it was the genesis.of the spaghetti western. But in many ways this is a better film. The characterization is richer and there is more of a budget to make the film bigger in scope. Sergio Leone would continue in this direction and his films that followed are much more epic and larger scale. Much of Leone's signature style is seen here with close ups and meticulous attention to details. Lee Van Cleef appears alongside Clint and together have good chemistry as bounty hunters who have a similar target and team up. The villain is the same Italian actor who was the bad guy in the 1st film. In my opinion, he was actually better in this and conveyed a sense of cruelty and madness.. Some might say his performance was too theatrical and over the top, but I thought it was a perfect counterbalance to the American actor's more subdued approach. My favorite of the trilogy is to come, The Good, The Bad And The Ugly. But for my money, For A Few Dollars More is still very good and was the inspiration for lots of spaghetti westerns to come in the later half of the 60's into the early 70's."
shakey_jake53,"Apr 9, 2003",8/10,"Though it's a little longer than it should be and drags at times, it's still a solid action packed western.  Clint is great, this time as a mysterious bounty killer, and the addition of Lee Van Cleef is good as the veteran bounty killer that Clint has to team up with.  There are a few too many unneccesary scene's including the constant flashbacks by the bad guy, but the action scene's were good, it was all well directed, and the score was solid as well.  I give it a 4/5, maybe would've got a higher rating if they had trimmed it a little, but as it is its a solid western."
jordondave-28085,"Oct 27, 2023",10/10,"(1965) For A Few Dollars More/ Per qualche dollaro in più
DUBBED
WESTERN/ ACTION/ COMEDYAfter the success of ""A Fistful of Dollars"", director Leone received more money for this second effort and the experience is somewhat of a masterpiece! Like director John Woo making films in Hong Kong, Leone watches other films and borrows specific scenes from other films and makes them better, in this case some came from ""High Noon"", ""Vera Cruz"" and ""The Bravados"" and at the same time makes those scenes as his own turning the whole experience as original as they come! Simplistic story about two bounty hunters going after a ruthless gang! With a little mystery leaving no clues until the final! Leone's trademark is plastered throughout topping the film of course with Ennio Morricone's brilliant musical score! Footnote: Excellent scene by scene analysis from 'film Historian' Sir Christopher Frayling from DVD."
jduyrhfngj,"Feb 2, 2021",10/10,"Just finished watching this movie for probably the twentieth time. IMO, his greatest western. Some may disagree, and that's your right. I'll also give props to A Fistful of Dollars, my number 2."
Trebaby,"Mar 8, 1999",N/A,"Having taken his cue from High Noon, Leone fashioned a true revisionism of the western genre while at the same time establishing a sort of standard in the process as displayed in Fistful of Dollars.  Most viewers rate The Good the Bad and the Ugly as the superior of the ""Dollars Trilogy,"" but I think a keen eye might spot For a Few Dollars More as the more compactly entertaining and indeed, more fully realized of the trio.  Morricone's haunting score (as recognised in the pocket watch's melody) and Leone's attention to an evocative mise-en-scene combine together with a plot that moves the viewer from title to end with (dark)humor, tension and finally beauty.  A ballet of sorts.  And did I mention that Lee and Clint are completely badass?"
djbeardpaperclip,"Nov 16, 2025",6/10,"Classic spaghetti western featuring our man teaming up with Lee van Cleef, seeking to collect the bounties on an outlaw gang of bank robbers.Great scenery, plenty of cigar chewing and gun slinging.

harrisonclarkfc,"Feb 24, 2024",8/10,"Very captivating throughout. Very good plot. Shooting scenes comically accurate for the time of filming. Great characters throughout. I really liked this film and would definitely watch it again even knowing the plot. You can watch this with pretty much any group of friends or family, it's either quite funny because of the comical western shoot outs or an interesting film with actually solid characters and a relatively varying plot line. I would say it is a must watch to have in your catalog of films to watch and is at least one film I remember. The relationship between characters is very good too."
jashezilla,"Sep 23, 2019",8/10,"The story, characters, and just the atmosphere of the whole thing is impeccable. And have to say, Clint Eastwood absolutely kills it."

jimbo-53-186511,"Nov 15, 2014",8/10,"In this second instalment in the dollars trilogy, we follow bounty killers Monco (Clint Eastwood)and Colonel Douglas Mortimer (Lee Van Cleef). Initially, both men work separately picking up reasonable bounties for reasonably notorious criminals. However, when both men discover that there is a $10,000 reward for capturing notorious outlaw El Indio, they both set to work in tracking him down.I think the Dollars Trilogy is probably the only Trilogy I've ever watched where the films have gradually improved as they've progressed. The first film was reasonably good, this second film was very good and the third film was outstanding. I suspect that Leone must have studied each film and looked at ways that he can further improve each of the sequels. I'm clearly not alone in this thought process as the IMDb ratings (at the time of writing this review) for each of the films are 8.1, 8.3 and 9.0 respectively. There isn't a weak film in this trilogy, but as mentioned it's noticeable that there was a steady improvement in quality.For a Few Dollars More has all the trademark qualities that we've come to expect; tension, humour, a good story, interesting characters. I've always felt Leone has his tongue firmly in his cheek when he makes these films and it's clear that he had a lot of fun making this trilogy. Leone also seemed to have a gift for creating tension from the most simple of situations; take the scene where a gang member blows Mortimer's match out and Mortimer just stands there staring at this man. I was sat there thinking what was he going to do? What's going to happen? This scene probably only lasted for a minute and was created out of nothing, but it's effectiveness was remarkable. Likewise, the same could be said for the early scene with Eastwood with the playing cards - a remarkably tense and well executed scene.The part of the film that I was most looking forward to was the inevitable showdown between Eastwood and Van Cleef. I honestly believe that these two guys were amongst the coolest leading men of that era. What made this showdown so brilliant is that it was tense when it needed to be tense and was hysterical when it needed to be funny. I won't spoil what happens in this scene, but let's just say that it won't be what you're expecting. It had me in stitches.Aside from all of the plus points noted above, this film like the first film and the third film in the trilogy also has that wonderful Ennio Morricone score.There really is very little to criticise this film about, but the only negative thing about this film is that I felt that the last 30 minutes was a bit too drawn out. Thankfully, there is enough tension to hold your interest, but the finale went on a bit long in my opinion. Aside from that, For a Few Dollars More is pretty much flawless."
turkcinemania,"May 15, 2003",N/A,"Well,no need to say anything about the cast,crew and script..They are magnificient.Especially the characters' carismatic actings impressed me a lot.First I had watched it when I was a litte boy in 1980's on T.V..Today I'm still watching it from dvd and the satisfaction level that I get is still the same.Between my top 5 list of the best films.Especially Lee Van Cleef was born to be bad,I wish I had a face like that..The film starts with a quote about a bounty killer,and the ambiance definetely smells smoke..Everytime I watched the way that Clint Eastwood smokes,I was tempted and light a cigar too..Take a full Nacho,a box of cigarettes,open the volume,lie down,and let this film reminds you the childhood times of your life...I think this film's music cuts gave an inspiration to the one of best western pc game ''outlaws''.An incredible shooting technic, makes me hard to believe to be done in 1965."
jesseen,"Sep 28, 2022",7/10,"A skilled bounty hunter marks for death a fearless gang leader recently sprung from jail by his gang. When the gang conspires to rob the most heavily-defended bank in the area, the hunter teams up with a rival to bring him down. With one hunter infiltrating the gang and one watching from the outside, can they put a stop to the plot and bring down the gang?Eastwood and Morricone do their habitual good work, but the newcomer, Van Cleef, is the one who steals the spotlight for me. He looks so cool with his gentlemanly attire, smorgasbord of expensive-looking guns, and hawkish gaze.Where in the first movie the villains aligned with basic types like ""brain"" and ""brawn,"" here we have one quite distinctive. The signature music-box tune of Volonte's character is pretty and I like how his backstory - the origin of his villainy, perhaps - fits into Van Cleef's character."
dieseldemon85,"Jun 27, 2022",10/10,"Most would probably say The Good,the bad and the ugly was the best, but my personal favorite is this entry. I enjoy the storyline of two bounty Hunters teaming up to take down a ruthless gang led by a psycho. Kinski was a great addition as a hunchback as well as Van Cleef as Col Mortimer. Morricone score for this film top notch, great tension added to the scenes with the gold watch playing it's haunting tune. It's a longer film with a run time if 2:13 but worth it."
Uriah43,"Apr 13, 2013",7/10,"Two rival bounty hunters, ""Monco"" (Clint Eastwood) and ""Colonel Douglas Mortimer"" (Lee Van Cleef) find themselves after the same bandit who goes by the name of ""El Indio"" (Gian Maria Volante). Realizing that El Indio has surrounded himself with so many other bandits, both of them enter into an uneasy alliance with each other. In the meantime, El Indio and his men have decided to rob the Bank of El Paso which raises the stakes for everyone. At any rate, this film is the second of the ""spaghetti westerns"" which followed the highly successful ""A Fistful of Dollars"". And although it isn't a sequel, it has several actors who starred in both films, most notably Clint Eastwood, Gian Maria Volante and Mario Brega (as the bandit, ""Nino""). And like the first movie, these three performed similar roles in a superb manner. But what really distinguishes this film from the previous one is the presence of Lee Van Cleef who, in my opinion, was just as good as Clint Eastwood. In any case, this film is just as good as its predecessor and those who enjoy this style of western are sure to appreciate this one as well."
FKDZ,"Aug 23, 2022",9/10,"Another Eastwood classic, with the show partially stolen by Van Cleef. Part of my western movie journey. Sergio Leone does it again and delivers a fantastic western. Compared to my first foray into the spaghettis westerns from Leone: A fistful of dollars. This entry, part of the so called dollar trilogy is nearly as good. It really hones in on the good guy bad guy dynamic and nothing else besides that exists. Fistful just had a few more characters in general with I think elevated it.Directorially this felt weaker than fistful, that still means it's incredible, but it felt a little less interesting. The editing is great at times and I love the creative inputs. That said the editing is also rough and caused the story at times hard to follow with no clear passage of time. Causing me to have to ''recalibrate'' and think ''oh that just happened''.Music here is once again iconic. I felt like there's was a little less of it used here, whereas in fistful it was used literally at any time they could. But in Few Dollars More we get the iconic soundtrack, the one that's deeply rooted as *the* western song. The music from the pocket watch is enchanting as well, and mixed so well.Characters are great, actors without a doubt just as good. Eastwood never slips, Van Cleef is incredible and probably my favorite Volontè owns his villainous role ones again with a complexity and depth we've come to love I guess. It was a little jarring because at first I though it was the same character as Fistful, as if this movie was a sequel. Obviously not but still.Negatives here are just some sloppy editing here and there and the sound quality and sound effects sound significantly worse. Some sounds being chopped off awkwardly and Music peaking a lot. This was the remastered version I watched. No negatives for annoying actors or anything. And I guess another negative, but this goes for I think the trilogy, is the lack of bullet holes in people's shirts and such.Great follow up and can't wait for TGTBATG."

Even the gun play is more outlandish (seeing the end of Clints cigar get shot off amused my son no end) as is the actions set pieces!! Once again Ennino Morricone's score is superb. Lee Gan Cleef is simply as cool as a cucumber, Gina Maria Volonte (Ramon Rojo in A Fist Full Of Dollars) returns and is as reliable as he was first time around and he isn't the only one returning, Benito Stefanelli and Aldo Sambrell return too. As for Clint, he was heading in to the 8th and final season of Rawhide, and he dusts off the very same poncho he wore in the first movie and stakes his claim as a bona fide movie starAs much as I love the first one, this one is even better!! And as a side note, the musical theme the watch played, was the first ringtone I ever downloaded!!Grossing $15 million A Few Dollars More was the 12th highest grossing movie and 1965.

nicho109,"Jan 23, 2004",10/10,"Like all of Leone's films, ""For a Few Dollars More"" is just as brilliant as GBU and OUAITW. The story has more direction, and is more tightly integrated as a whole in comparison to other films in the dollars trilogy. If you haven't seen it, see it today, and hope for a better DVD transfer soon!Every ""famous"" modern day director has taken influences from Leone's work, but have never topped it. Nitpicking any of Leone's films is like nitpicking Mozart or Michelangelo. Only Kurosawa can come close to Leone, and if there is an eternity, only he is worthy of washing his Leone's feet.It's too bad he made so few films.Also, this film wouldn't be half of what it is without Morricone or Eastwood. Both are absolutely topnotch here."

Treammolb,"Mar 16, 2020",8/10,"The second in Sergio Leone's so-called 'Dollar' Trilogy (which isn't truly a trilogy, but more three westerns which star some of the same actors, the same music, and carry a similar aesthetic). 'For a few dollars more' hones in on Manco (played by Clint Eastwood), a bounty hunter in pursuit of the somewhat unstable and crazed criminal El Indio (Gian Maria Volonte). Quickly, Manco partners with a different bounty hunter Col. Douglas Mortimer (portrayed by an excellent Lee van Cleef, in a rare outing as a good guy).The film seems relatively straightforward throughout, a simple hunt for a criminal, of course riddles with the typical Serhio Leone sound effects, shoot outs, camera shots, and Ennio Morricone's excellent music. Whereas normally Morricone's music elevates the material (for example, 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly'), here it at times hinders the scenes, detracting from the more touching moments, where the music invokes heroism, which just does not align with the film at times. This is most noticeable in the finale, where the scene already has a haunting theme playing, but this gets covered with Morricone's score, invoking the wrong type of emotion.Preceding this scene, the relatively plain hunt for El Indio is interspersed with flashbacks which give hints to what caused El Indio to become what he is, adding gravitas and intrigue to the entire picture. His obsession with playing a tune from a keepsake, raising images of a nursery song, carrying notes of innocence, but above all give the moments a eerie and uneasy feeling. These flashbacks culminate in a slight twist making for a deeply satisfying and poignant finale which touches upon a variety of deeper themes, that I did not experience in Leone's greatest work (the aforementioned 'The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly').All in all, it does not carry the scale and production values of Leone's later works, and is somewhat limited and simple in scope. However, the human elements throughout give it a deeper layer, which makes this for a thoroughly enjoyable and satisfying watch."
D_I_Sammi,"Oct 27, 2024",7/10,"Improving upon his two previous films, Sergio Leone directs another western delight, with another strong sense of uniqueness and individuality even with returning actors.Clint Eastwood delivers a great performance and he is given great chemistry this time with the cast. Lee Van Cleef for me is the star - a truly tough and striking performance. Gian Maria Volontè is also given a better character who is much more volatile and maddening.The pace is quicker and the stance of the movie is more defined. It still suffers from some long slow moments but the overall film delivers more content than the previous two movies with greater focus on character arcs producing one of the best endings to any movie I've seen."
saadanathan,"Apr 14, 2020",8/10,Clint Eastwood and lee van cliff team up for the first time against a bunch of criminals. Great performance by both actors and Sergio Leone has done a fantastic job with the movie itself. What appears to be a task to hunt down criminals for money turns out to be much more personal for one of the characters and that is a good script.

super_johnny_c_uk,"Apr 18, 2002",8/10,"says Clint as he takes his cigar out of his mouth and looks at it, then he grins. The loose series of films from which this is the second, is the second best. It is essentially an enhanced blueprint for the third film, but within that is an excellent film in its own right. Clint and Lee Van Cleef are fantastic as they play off each other whilst trying to track down notorious bandit El Indio and dont trust each other as far they could toss each other. There are excellent action set pieces which keeps the dialogue and story flowing nicely in the just over two hour running period. Highly recommended, so try For A Fistful of Dollars and The good the bad and the ugly too."
