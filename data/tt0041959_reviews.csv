frankwiener,"Oct 26, 2016",9/10,"Although I am as old as this movie, produced in 1949, I have not aged nearly as well. This film, directed brilliantly by Carol Reed (""Odd Man Out"", ""The Fallen Idol"") and written by Graham Greene, who created a long list of memorable cinematic scripts, ingeniously captures the prevailing atmosphere of disruption and chaos that Vienna, a once highly civilized city, experienced during the years that followed World War II. The upheaval is physical, social, economic, political, moral, spiritual. You name it. Vanquished Vienna, conquered by the Allies, was crippled by turmoil in every imaginable way, and we viewers are given the opportunity to experience it up close, right here.I spent a number of months in Europe after I graduated from college in 1971. Although the war had been over for more than 25 years by then, I was struck by a very pronounced attitude of cynicism on the part of many Europeans regarding uniquely American ideals and principles, which were widely considered to be naive. To me, this film accurately captures this cultural and moral conflict, which lasted for decades and may even survive to this day. ""You and your American principles,"" they would often scoff at me with mocking derision. In many ways, the character of Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American who crashes into post-World War II Europe, is a victim of a serious cultural divide. Unlike the Europeans, Martins always has the option of fleeing from the chaos and returning to the United States. For that alone, he may be resented by the local Viennese.What does Anna (Alida Valli) know about the illegal activities of her lover, Harry Lime (Orson Welles), which includes the sale of diluted penicillin to Vienna's hospitals? For children with meningitis, watered down penicillin was not only useless, but it created an immunity from full strength penicillin so that these afflicted children could never receive effective treatment. Corrupted penicillin is a glaring symbol of a totally corrupted Vienna. Harry surely understands the consequences of his business, but what about Anna? Even after the truth about Harry's conduct is clearly revealed to her, she still sticks by him to the bitter end. Love conquers all? Stand by your man, regardless of the misery that he is causing to his innocent victims? While I don't blame her for rejecting the romantic overtures of Martins, who is somewhat of a schnook, what's with her anyway? She reminds me of the Europeans who never once caught a whiff of the burning flesh from the overworked crematoria of the concentration camps that blackened the air all around them. She is deeply in love with Harry, so just shut up about children with meningitis. OK, Anna, whatever you say, sweetheart. Perhaps those silly 18th century costume comedies in which you appear will provide the escape from reality that you so desperately seek. At least you manage to crack a weak, forced smile on stage, which is the only smile that we will ever see from you.From beginning to end, the unusual camera angles, the dark, somber, haunting sidewalks of Vienna, and the conquered city's eerie, drenched cobblestone streets contribute to the overall foreboding atmosphere of the film, which was remarkably photographed by Australian Robert Krasker (""Odd Man Out"", ""Brief Encounter""). From every direction and without advance notice, unforgettable images and characters appear before us, emphasizing an overall mood of mayhem and unpredictability. We witness, for example, Anna's landlady, draped in a bedspread for warmth in a state of deep distress by the sudden invasion of her house by ""officials"" representing not one foreign nation but four of them. Then we observe a ludicrous, bureaucratic ""cultural re-education conference"" offered to the Viennese by the allied victors, presumably to rehabilitate them after seven years of Nazi domination. And from where on earth did the balloon seller come as he pathetically peddles his merry merchandise on the dark, abandoned streets of Vienna, which are not only completely void of children at the time but of all people?And what of the inquisitive, confused character of Holly Martins, played with the usual, smooth agility of Joseph Cotten? As the writer of mass marketed western novels that even a young British sergeant happens to read, why is he broke, and what kind of job would Lime have offered him in an unfamiliar, German-speaking Vienna that is gripped by post-war disorder, unemployment, and foreign occupation? Construction work, perhaps?While some reviewers disliked the zither music of Anton Karas, I think that the unique, high pitched sound contributes to the general atmosphere of nervous tension and uneasiness that prevails. Would you prefer Strauss waltzes instead? They wouldn't be nearly as effective in conveying the overwhelming atmosphere of chaos, even insanity, that plagues Vienna on so many levels at the time.Finally, we are brought to the hidden network of grand Vienna's underground sewers. What could be a more fitting symbol of the underlying foulness that lurks beneath the thin, shallow surface of what we call ""civilization""? This subterranean labyrinth provides the perfect setting for the ending of an extraordinary film that very effectively portrays a world that has succumbed to a state of disorder, misery, and even madness. Ultimately, it is all destined for the sewer. Bal-loon?"
Xstal,"Dec 24, 2022",8/10,"Holly Martins has just arrived in Vienna, but he's found himself with a small dilemma, his mate Harry has just died, with a car he did collide, although the circumstance is causing him some bother. As he peels back several lids of several cans, it transpires Harry was a wanted man, had his fingers in some pies, to do with medical supplies, the authorities were not his biggest fan.Dark and deceptive goings on, above and below the streets of Vienna post WWII, with some outstanding and perpetually incredible performances against a background of shadows, shifting perspectives and immoral behaviour."
Lechuguilla,"Jun 20, 2009",9/10,"In a bombed-out Vienna just after WWII, novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives from America to renew a friendship with his childhood buddy, Harry Lime (Orson Welles). Much to the dismay of Holly, a freak auto accident has recently killed his friend, according to those who knew Harry.But in searching for details of Lime's death, Holly gets contradictory stories that don't add up. One of the persons who knew Lime is an attractive woman named Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) whose continued presence in the story invites suspicion. The film's plot has Holly searching for the truth about his friend, while trying to stave off a city detective, Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) who tries to persuade Holly to leave Vienna.The film's story is okay. But what makes ""The Third Man"" really interesting is the B&W cinematography, by Robert Krasker. Unlike most films, camera movement here is restricted, so as to draw attention to each frame's geometry. Typically in this film, a frame is tilted at an angle so that both vertical and horizontal points of reference are off-kilter. Frame images thus become a series of diagonal straight lines and curves. Further, very high-contrast lighting, especially in outdoor scenes at night, creates a bizarre, almost nightmarish look and feel, and are suggestive of German Expressionism.All of which results in a visual disorientation for viewers that parallels Holly's disorientation both in the streets of Vienna and in his understanding of the circumstances surrounding Lime's absence. In most outdoor scenes there's a conspicuous lack of crowds, a lack of hubbub one would expect in a bustling city. Instead, only a few secondary characters appear in night scenes. This sparseness in characters on the streets conveys the impression that hidden eyes are watching Holly, ready to pounce at any moment from out of dark shadows.""Everybody ought to (be) careful in a city like this"", says one character to Holly, as an implied threat. Soon, a man who wants to give Holly some valuable information is murdered.The script's dialogue is quite impressive, with some interesting lines and points of view. Some of the dialogue is in German, which enhances authenticity.The film's acting and editing are very, very good. Adding a slightly romantic, and at times melancholy, tone to this dark film is the music of the ""zither"", an instrument similar to a guitar, but sounding quite different.My one complaint about this film is that it's hard to keep tabs on some of the background characters. Trying to connect names with faces can be difficult, resulting in some confusion.""The Third Man"" tells an interestingly bleak story, set in a bleak, desolate urban environment, rendered truly mesmerizing by the creatively surreal B&W cinematography."
dougdoepke,"Nov 9, 2015",N/A,"No need to recap the oft-repeated plot. So why bother commenting after 500+ reviews. I guess it's because I'm a movie lover and want to enter my little note of appreciation. What sticks in my mind from the movie's first release are the visuals. They're among the most memorable if not the most memorable in film annals. In sum, they're a nightmare world of emptiness-the streets, the walkways, the dead hulking edifices. It's a communal world emptied of community, leaving only ruins and shells. The metaphor for a post-war Europe is unmistakable, while only the morally destitute like Harry Lime have thrived. I can't imagine that filming in color was actually entertained (IMDB). Had that happened, the film would have passed into semi-obscurity unlike its now celebrated status. Note too, that no one ends up happy, in contrast to narrative norms of the day. I think what brought many folks to showings at the time was the unfamiliar zither music. As I recall, a commercial cut was heard regularly on the radio. Still, I expect a lot of folks left the theater put-off by the bleakly unhappy world they had just seen. Anyway, the movie remains a brilliant slice of cinematic imagination and should not be missed."
blanche-2,"Feb 6, 2016",10/10,"Even today in Vienna, one can take the ""Third Man Tour"" (Der Dritte Man) except, of course, that Orson Welles wouldn't go into the Viennese sewers and those scenes were done in England. There were actual sewer scenes with a double.Never mind, it is still a magnificent black and white film 99% filmed in Vienna. Directed by Carol Reed, it stars Joseph Cotten, Orson Welles, and Alida Valli.Western novelist Holly Martins (Cotten) comes to Vienna at the behest of his old friend Harry Lime, but when he arrives, he learns that Lime is dead after being hit by a car. He investigates and finds the circumstances very strange indeed, especially when learning there was a third man that helped carry Harry's body to the sidewalk, a man who has since disappeared.He then meets Harry's girlfriend (Alida Valli). And he also meets a police officer in the British section of Vienna, Inspector Calloway (Trevor Howard), who tells him that Harry was a murderer and a racketeer, and it's better that he's dead. Holly is shocked and demands proof.One of the most atmospheric films ever made, with its zither music, cinematography, and Vienna at nighttime. Then there's some brilliant dialogue, particularly the ""cuckoo clock"" speech made by Orson Welles.The cinematography is particularly striking: odd angles, back lighting, and shadows on empty streets. And who can forget the man hidden in the doorway, when the light from an apartment goes on and shows his face - certainly one of the great appearances of a star in a film.One feels Lime's presence throughout the film, though he only has five minutes of screen time.Though none of these actors were the first choice to play their roles, they are all excellent.There was a Third Man TV series in 1959 that ran for six years and starred Michael Rennie as Lime. In the series, Lime is a hero.He's no hero in the movie, but it is a powerful story and film, never forgotten once seen."
mmt02,"Jun 26, 1999",10/10,"The Third Man is a movie that looks and feels not like a movie of the 40s, but like a neo-noir of the late 60s/early 70s. This wonderful example of classic noir is one of the all time greatest films. It combines amazing visuals, sounds, dialogue, and acting to tell a thrilling story and comment about the atmosphere after WWII.Of all the movies durring the studio era (pre-1960ish), there are three movies with cinematography that always stick out in my mind: Gregg Toland's work in Citizen Kane, Russel Mety's work in Touch of Evil, and Robert Krasker's work in The Third Man (all starring Orson Welles funny enough). I just recently saw a restored 35mm version of The Third Man. The crisp black and white visuals of a bombed out Vienna are so breath-taking. Shadows are everywhere. The unique way Krasker tilts the camera in some shots adding to the disorientation of the plot. And who can forget the first close-up of Welles with the light from an apartment room above splashing onto his face; one of the great entrances in movie history (Lime gives his old friend a smile that only Welles could give).The cinematography is backed by strong performances by Welles, Cotten, and italian actress Vali. The writing of Greene is wonderful; you can see the plot twisting around Cotten tightly. But what makes The Third Man so great is its historical commentary (well not really historical since it was commenting on its own time, but to us it is historical). On one level The Third Man is a story of betrayal and corruption in a post-war, occupied Vienna. On the other hand, its giving the audience a glimpse of the mood of Europe after the great war. The uncertainty that the Cold War was bringing is evident through out the film; Cotten is constantly trying to figure out who to trust. Vienna is on the frontier of the new communist bloc (we even see the communists infiltrating Vienna trying to bring Vali back to her native Czechoslavakia). The zither music score combined with the stark images of bombed out Vienna are reminiscent of the frontier towns of American Westerns. So The Third Man is not only a wonderful film noir, but a unique look at the brief time between WWII and the height of the Cold War."
SnoopyStyle,"Jan 17, 2016",7/10,"Pulp western writer Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives in post-war Vienna to work for old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) but is told that Harry is dead. The city is divided under the control of the Allies. British Major Calloway (Trevor Howard) tells him that Harry was a criminal. He decides to investigate Harry's death. Anna Schmidt (Alida Valli) is Harry's girlfriend. Harry's friends Baron Kurtz and Popescu describe the accident but Holly is told by another that there was a third man.The best part of this movie is director Carol Reed. His camera work is amazing. The best scene for me is the balloon man. When he walks around the corner, it is the funniest and most shocking moment in the movie. Orson Welles is so tied into this movie but I don't find him threatening enough. He's more of a trickster. I would like Harry Lime to be scarier. Also Anna is an infuriating character. Overall, the story is fine. Joseph Cotten is great. The movie is a cinematic art work."
gleslie-53203,"Feb 15, 2023",10/10,"Where to begin. For starters Graham Greene. You know he understood the devastation Europe had gone through. You just can't make a film like this without it. That's what The Third Man is about - the devastation of Europe and how that affected people, both morally and physically.Holly Martins, the main character, is who's eyes we see the post-war world through as he uncovers the mystery of the death of his friend Harry.Back to Graham Greene - He wrote the novella. He writes about human misery as well as anyone. And there was no shortage of misery and lack of morals in post-war Vienna. He's also a master of conflict, both external and internal, which is where I'm going here. His characters struggle with their own souls to the point of anguish. Loss is another thing he nails.There are a few more reasons this is the best movie ever made. The next is the editing. The chase scene at the end gets all the love but-this is going to be hard to articulate but the editing is so innovative I have to try-unlike most editors who edit based on sound and dialogue, this movie is kind of reverse. It's almost like the rhythm of the scene is dictating when to cut. It's a ""feel"" thing established either within a scene or the entire movie or both. It really has to be experienced, not just written about.The next reason is the grandiosity of the visuals. It's unbelievable how grand everything is. This totally falls in line with Orson Welles noir style and the German expressionism that influenced this film. Carol Reed's choice of lenses throughout the film are perfect. Space is played with perfectly. This falls in line with my next reason, which is the noir style that is done so well. The mood is established and kept throughout, employing the noir and the expressionist style.And lastly, this movie didn't just defy convention, it obliterated it - the visuals, the sounds, the story, the locations, the style, the score (which consisted of one musical instrument), and the people; the way Carol Reed presented their despair. I'm preaching to the choir. I know you know."
ryansrusso,"Aug 15, 2015",10/10,"Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949) is a remarkable film noir that if you haven't seen, you most certainly should. Set in postwar Vienna, Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) arrives to visit an old friend who had offered him a job. From there the twisty, fast paced ride begins with the first twist being thrown at you in under ten minutes. The film aged very well, and even if you don't usually watch black and white movies, this one should be made an exception. Although the movie deals with lots of dark themes such as murder, corruption, and the Black Market, it is portrayed in a comical way, especially due to the performances and unique score. The fast paced dialogue, perfectly timed music, and direction all add to the films wit and pace. There are lots of short shots, dutch angles, jump cuts to keep you engaged and you are never bored or unsatisfied. The cinematographer certainly earned his paycheck because the films cinematography is unbelievable. With each transition you are prepared for a little more of the truth and intrigue to be revealed so you can try to figure out the mystery before the ending. And may I add that the finale is one of the greatest you'll ever see. The classic sewer chase sequence will stick with you forever. In conclusion, The Third Man is a film that must be seen if you are a fan of mysteries, classics films, and interested in seeing truly one of the best films (One of Roger Ebert's top 4)."
AAdaSC,"Sep 8, 2013",4/10,"Author Joseph Cotten (Holly) is invited to Vienna by his friend Orson Welles (Harry Lime). There is a major problem with this set-up from the outset as it is revealed that Welles has just been killed. Cotton attends the burial but sticks around in Vienna as there seems to be a great deal of suspicion surrounding the death of his buddy.The film has an interesting setting and idea for a story but I'm afraid that it just drags - it's drawn-out and never gets moving. Cotten is dreary in the lead role but Welles is the best thing in the film and delivers his amusing famous quote comparing Italy with Switzerland. The scene on the Ferris wheel is a standout scene as the audience experiences the only real moment of tension as the carriage door is opened at the top of the ride. Uh-oh – is anybody going over the edge?A mention must be made of the music – it's all zithery throughout. To further clarify, it sounds like a mixture between Greek music and French café accordion music. And it provides moments of over-exaggerated melodrama that just ends up comical. It is also just basically out-of-place belonging more in an art film or 1960s camp comedy horror.The story is not bad and the film could have been so much more interesting – we are given about 30 minutes of plot stretched out to nearly 2 hours. Definitely not the classic that everyone blindly labels it as – it is vastly over-rated right up to the final chase scene in the sewers – a plot device that was done a year before in the better film ""He Walked By Night"" (1948) which provided far more tension and a better sewer chase."
uds3,"Mar 29, 2002",N/A,"What IS it makes THE THIRD MAN the classic most everyone agrees it is? (And lets face it, voted no 35 in the top all-time films gives it MORE than just some passing credibility!) Is it Orson Welles' menace? The whiff of corruption in occupied post-war Vienna? the cuckoo-clock speech atop the big wheel? even Anton Karras' zither? Perhaps ALL these things? If however, you had to nominate just a single influence within the whole production that elevates it to greatness I suggest that would be Robert Krasker's cinematography.The finished product innovatively, was years ahead of its birthright. Time and time again the viewer is bailed up by stunning camera angles and back-lighting. The eerie shadows around the deserted streets and of course the unforgettable first glimpse of Harry Lime (Welles) himself as he skulks like the rat he is, in the corner of the building, lit in close-up suddenly from the light in an adjacent apartment. Offhand I cannot think of a character's more dramatic entrance to a film.Welles in fact has minimal screen time, though his dark presence and influence infiltrate proceedings like an insidious disease. Yet somehow his ultimate demise in the sewers brings into play an incredible sadness and compassion that has absolutely no right being there. It remains for me one of my top five film favorites. I have always given it a ""10"" personally but hey, to be voted an ""8.6"" universally is a pretty fair vindication of my words here."
Galina_movie_fan,"Jun 18, 2004",9/10,"Who was Harry Lime (Orson Welles)? An evil man, devil in the flesh who was responsible for the unspeakable crimes, yet brilliant, cheerful and charismatic. His most famous words, a short speech written by Welles himself, say a lot about his character and motivations:""In Italy for 30 years under the Borgies they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock.""No wonder, we like him, even though we know what he'd doneIt has been said thousands of times about the greatest movie entrance ever  but what about his 'exit'  the fingers on the street? I think it is one of the greatest, tooA beautiful mysterious girl with tragic past was in love with him and the unforgettable ending, so antiHollywood, so true to the film - was about her love that goes beyond the grave. I read that both Selznick (the producer) and author Graham Greene had initially argued for something more upbeat (Holly and Anna walking off arm-in-arm), but Reed disagreed. I am so happy that Reed won (I am sure millions of fans are, too). That was the way to finish the movie and make it much more than just typical noir. Makes the viewer think about love, friendship, betrayal, loyalty, the price one pays for them.Amazing film - perfectly shot; almost flawless. It looks and feels like Welles himself could've made it. The influence of Citizen Kane is undeniable. The only problem I had  the music. I like it but it was very strange to hear it in the film like The Third Man. Maybe that was a purpose  instead of somber, moody, and ominous music that would be expected for the noir film, something completely different and out of place  cheerful but melancholy in the same timeCriterion DVD is wonderful  the restored version of the film shines. There are two openings of the film available  British and American, and a lot of extras."

Joseph Cotten plays cheap novelette author Holly Martins, just arrived in Vienna to meet with long-time friend Harry Lime, who offered him a job. He instead meets with the mysterious facts surrounding the death of Lime, learned bit-by-bit from Lime's friends, a woman named Anna Schmidt, who has problems of her own (played excellently by Valli), and two British officers, Calloway and Paine. Learning, that there is more to death of Lime than there seems to be, Martins begins his investigation for the truth. This film was shot with some of the greatest, most ahead-of-its-time cinematography ever, and it creates mystery and deceit. It is complimented by the excellent use of shadows. The soundtrack is essentially one long song, which plays throughout the film, changing and stopping as the emotion calls for. It is a zither composition by Anton Karas made for the film. This is all topped off by an engrossing storyline, and a great performance by Joseph Cotten, as the ordinary man mixed up in this web of mystery."
Sleepin_Dragon,"Oct 9, 2023",9/10,"The Third Man even now is a classic mystery, time has been very kind to this film. It moves by at an enjoyable pace, it gives an interesting look at a post war Vienna, and features some startlingly good visuals, Vienna is a stunning City, they make great use of it.It's a classic film noir, if you're a fan of the genre, the you'll very likely know this film, and probably enjoy it, it's very nearly up there with the likes of Double Indemnity and The Maltese Falcon, definitely of that ilk. Lots of twists and turns, you can't always believe what you're told...There's a lot of German spoken throughout, that helps to give it a very authentic feel, not something you'd see too often in English speaking movies.Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Joseph Cotten and Alida Valli are all wonderful, every single player is a big character, there are no but party players here.Ardent fans of the Carry on films, will know full well that half of Carry on Spying came from any number of James Bond films, the other half came from this, right down to the catchy music.This film definitely has the rewatch factor, it just never gets old.Class!9/10."
jotix100,"Oct 13, 2004",10/10,"A great deal has been said about ""The Third Man"" by contributors to this forum. Having seen the restored copy that was shown at the Film Forum, recently, I could not resist watching this masterpiece once more when it was shown by TCM, the other night.This movie owes a debt of gratitude to Graham Greene, a writer who had the most developed sense of intrigue among his contemporaries and one of the best writers of the last century. It also helped that a great director, Carol Reed, brought it to the screen. Mr. Reed was a director who had an eye for detail, as he demonstrates here, as well as in the rest of the body of work he left for us to enjoy.The screen play is faithful to the original novel. If to all of the other elements we add the fabulous cinematography of Robert Krasker, the result has to be the masterpiece we see today. Never before has a city taken center stage in the development of the story that is presented here. Mr. Krasker's wonderful night vision of this city enhances the story as we are taken along for a fantastic trip of the post war Vienna of 1949.The casting of this film is amazing. Never had so many excellent actors been thrown together in a film, as it is the case as with this picture. Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, Trevor Howard, Orson Welles, Bernard Lee, Ernst Deutsch, Paul Horbiger, Erich Ponto and Wilfred Hyde White are splendid in their roles. It is hard to imagine these characters played by other actors.Orson Welles has perhaps the best part, even though his time before the camera is short. This must have been one of the best roles in which Welles appeared. Of course, there are so many others, but his Harry Lime is an original and could have fitted perfectly in one of his own films.The music by Anton Karas is still haunting, with the exception of a few times at the beginning of a couple of scenes, when it startles the viewer and actually doesn't add anything to what we are about to see.This film will live forever."
cricketbat,"Aug 16, 2018",6/10,"I respect the ""classic"" status of The Third Man, but I could not get past the soundtrack. The zither music was distracting to me and it ruined what could have been some intense moments. The story was slow, but interesting and the characters were awkward, but relatable. I still think Orson Welles is a bit overrated, but he was excellent in this film."

Billed as a thriller and film noir it is really comparable to Romeo and Juliette. The final scene proves love is the message.
ma-cortes,"Oct 3, 2008",8/10,"The motion picture concerns an American writer of pulp Western named Holy Martin (Joseph Cotten), he arrives in a post-war devastating Vienna to see his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles), but Holy discovers he has been killed.

Lime is allegedly dead , but is finally pursued throughout the sewers by military authorities (Trevor Howard, Bernard Lee, Geoffrey Keen).Based on Grahame Greene novel, this classic noir thriller is an excellent story lavishly produced by the great American producer David O'Selznick and Hungarian producer Alexander Korda. This is a deeply satisfying and intelligent picture to not be missed, using a considerable talent in acting, as main cast as secondary actors formed mostly by foreigner players of various countries and utilizing the cream of the cream of British experts in writing and technical departments. With a plethora of anthological images and dialogs, such as the scenes about conversation in the marry-go-round between Harry Lime and Martin, and the underground-sewers pursuits. Magnificent Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten, great friends in real life ; Welles reportedly intervened in direction mainly on his scenes, though at an interview he explained that Carol Reed directed totally this outstanding movie.

Atreyu_II,"Feb 3, 2011",4/10,"I read many wonders about this film, considering the very positive reviews it gets. It even is considered one of the greatest films ever. Judging by the general descriptions regarding this motion picture, it was even said to be a great story of suspense.I was expecting a noir film comparable to 'The Window' (1949), which is one of my favorite films. It turned out to be disappointing, nothing of what I expected.It isn't until the last 10 minutes that something begins to happen at all, but that's just so little, especially comparing to the rest of it where nothing special happens. It's just way too slow-paced, boring and dull, made me yawn of boredom. Suspense? Zero suspense!It was one of those films that left me indifferent. It's very far from being one of the best ever, being clearly far more praised than it really deserves. Not even the fact that it takes place in Vienna can save it. While Vienna is a beautiful place, the movie doesn't show that much of Vienna. On the other hand, the film has both English and German language.'The Fallen Idol' (which is from the same director) was better than this and had more suspense than this (even if still very little)."
Snow Leopard,"Jul 23, 2001",N/A,"This is a rare film that is flawless in every respect.  It combines great acting and memorable characters with a fascinating story, taking place in an interesting setting and adding a creative musical score.  ""The Third Man"" is remembered for many things - for Orson Welles' wonderful performance in his appearances as Harry Lime, for its wonderfully appropriate musical score, and for its nicely conceived plot surprises.  Adding to these is Joseph Cotten's fine portrayal of Holly Martins, which holds the rest of it together - it is his character who initiates most of the action, and also through whom we view everything and everyone else.The story starts, after a nicely done prologue, with Martins arriving in Vienna, and finding out that his friend Harry is not only dead but is accused of running a particularly destructive black market racket.  Martins sets out at once to prove his friend's innocence, getting into an immediate scuffle with the police, and it seems at first to set up a conventional plot about clearing the name of a friend - but the actual story that follows is much deeper and much better.  It is just right that Martins is an innocent who writes cheap novels for a living, and he gets a pretty memorable lesson in fiction vs. reality.  There are some great scenes (the Ferris-wheel confrontation being as good a scene as there is in classic cinema) leading up to a memorable climactic sequence, and a good supporting cast, with Alida Valli as Anna being very good in complementing Lime and Martins.  The setting in crumbling post-war Vienna and the distinctive zither score go very nicely with the story.This is a fine, flawless classic, and while obviously belonging to an earlier era, it deserves a look from anyone who appreciates good movies."
rgpaeplrp,"Aug 20, 2025",8/10,"Man, The Third Man... now that's a movie. One of those old films that doesn't just hold up - it gets better the more you sit with it. It's set in post-war Vienna, which is already moody and broken, and they lean into that hard. The whole place looks like it's been through hell and is still trying to look proper, you know? Joseph Cotten plays this American writer - writes cowboy stories of all things - who shows up looking for his friend, Harry Lime. Only, Harry's dead. But nothing in this movie is that straightforward. It's got that perfect noir feel- shadows everywhere, everyone's hiding something, and the whole city feels like it's keeping secrets. Then Orson Welles shows up - late in the film, mind you - but when he does, it's like the whole thing tilts on its axis. His entrance? That scene with the cat and the shadows? Still iconic. And that Ferris wheel monologue? Gives you chills, even now. He's charming in the worst way. The kind of guy you want to trust, even when you know better. And the music - good Lord, that zither. It shouldn't work, but it does. It's like this weird, cheerful little tune playing. Unsettling in the best way. It's got betrayal, moral gray areas, some romance that never gets to bloom, and an ending that doesn't sugarcoat a thing. No big emotional swell, no happy reunion. Just truth and silence. And? That final scene might be one of the best I've ever seen. If you haven't seen it, watch it. If you have, watch it again. It's that kind of film."
canermustafa,"Aug 25, 2024",8/10,"""The Third Man"" is a fascinating film noir that masterfully combines suspense, mystery, and an unforgettable atmosphere. Set in post-WWII Vienna, the film captures the decaying beauty of a city divided and grappling with the aftermath of war. The story follows Holly Martins, a pulp fiction writer, as he investigates the suspicious death of his friend Harry Lime.The film's standout element is undoubtedly its stunning cinematography. The use of shadows, tilted angles (known as Dutch Angles), and stark contrasts creates a haunting visual style that perfectly complements the film's noir mood. The famous zither score by Anton Karas is another highlight, adding an eerie, almost whimsical quality to the unfolding drama.Orson Welles (one of my favourite directors) delivers a captivating performance as Harry Lime, with his brief but definitely memorable screen presence leaving a lasting impression. His iconic molonogue on the Ferris wheel is chilling and thought-provoking, just as you would whistle in the dark, encapsulating the themes of mor ambiguity and the corrupting influence of power.While the plow can be a bit slow at times (I watched the UK version), and some of the dialogue may feel dated, this movie remains a classic for a good reason. Its atmosphere, visual style, and memorable performances make it a must-watch for any fan of film noir or classic cinema. The film's exploration of post-war morality and human nature adds depth to what could have been just another whodunit detective story, making it a truly compelling watch."
Doylenf,"Dec 11, 2005",7/10,"THE THIRD MAN is an effective piece of late '40s film noir, but in my opinion is a rather overrated one, accompanied as it is by a distracting zither score that some believe is the film's crowning achievement, aside from Robert Krasker's B&W photography.Joseph Cotten gives his usual low-key performance as the pulp writer who wants to track down what really happened to his friend, Harry Limes (Orson Welles) whom he suspects has met with foul play and Valli is similarly low-key in her role as Limes' lonely sweetheart. Trevor Howard is excellent as Major Calloway who tries to help both Cotten and Valli, warning both of the dangers they face.The B&W Oscar-winning photography of post-war Vienna is crisply detailed and shadowy in its display of virtually empty cobblestoned streets at night and the background score is unusual and sometimes even striking.But therein lies the trouble. Not all of the famous Anton Karas zither score seems appropriate for the on screen action, although whether this is intentional or not, I don't pretend to know. For me, much of the score works against the story instead of creating the proper amount of tension in the script, as atmospheric as the Austrian music is.If ever a story of post-war Vienna troubled by corrupt officials and black market thieves and murderers needed an orchestrated score by a Bernard Herrmann type of composer, this is it. Others have praised the zither score to the skies, but I'm of the firm opinion that ""The Third Man Theme"" itself is the high point of this particular score, effectively used every time the mysterious Orson Welles appears.His theme became enormously popular as ""The Third Man Theme"" and deserved its success as a single--but as others have observed, the rest of the zither score becomes a bit monotonous after awhile and plays against what is happening on screen instead of deepening the emotional impact of the story. In fact, there are times when it becomes distracting and even irritating.It's an interesting, almost semi-documentary kind of film from Carol Reed that has Welles appearing only toward the halfway point and then only briefly. He gives one of his better performances, more controlled, less florid than usual, although the film is carried chiefly by Cotten, Howard and Valli and some superb photography.The story is told in such a cold documentary manner that there is almost an air of detachment about connecting to any of the characters we are supposed to care about. In this respect, it is Trevor Howard's Major Calloway that comes across as the most likable and fully developed character in the story.Trivia note: The kitten seen in Valli's apartment and devoted to Harry Limes is not the same creature that rubs against him in the doorway scene, an obviously older cat. How did they think a sharp-eyed movie fan would not notice??"
snoozejonc,"Feb 10, 2021",10/10,"An American author arrives in post-war Vienna following a job offer from a friend.The Third Man is a classic film with incredible visuals, a unique soundtrack and streak of darkness running through its heart.With a mysterious death driving the plot, we journey through the city with Holly Martins the American author who writes Western novels about heroes, villains, right and wrong. On the way we encounter cynicism, exploitation, betrayal, loyalty and complexity lurking beneath shadows.As the mystery unravels so does a number of interesting themes. A European city ravaged by war and infested by criminal enterprises, home to displaced citizens and where innocent lives can be crushed like ants underfoot. Who is to say what is right and what is wrong following a period in history when heroes carpet bombed and nuked entire cities? Certainly not Hollywood script writers or pulp western novelists.Every scene is captured by some of the most striking and effective cinematography of all time. The high contrast imagery is incredibly beautiful and sometimes distorted for maximum weirdness. Darkness, light and shadow have rarely been used to better effect.The characters are compelling and embody Graham Greene's cynicism and dark humour in what they say and do. Nobody is straightforward or particularly logical, other than one important individual in his own self-serving way.All actors are perfectly cast with Joseph Cotten leading strongly and the likes of Trevor Howard, Valli, Bernard Lee providing brilliant support. Orson Welles of course has a memorable cameo in some of the film's most famous scenes.Probably the most memorable aspect of The Third Man is Anton Karas' zither composition used to score it. The first time I heard it was with an 89 year old relative who hadn't heard it since the cinema in 1949 and before I even inserted the DVD he started humming the tune accurately.Add to the mix some excellent practical sound effects and everything comes together for a perfect assault on your eyes, ears and brain.The third man has one of the best plot reveals and arguably the greatest ending in cinema history, but I'm sure that's very much up for debate."
fredrik-m-987-845353,"Jan 19, 2020",6/10,"In my opinion the movie is decent but not as great as most thought. What really grinds my gears would be the god awful music! I have never in my entire life heard a more lousy soundtrack to a movie. It's not only terrible but ill-fitting in every single way possible. This is a drama/mystery movie with a hint of thrills, yet the soundtrack tries to tell you it's some sort of Hawaiian hula girl movie. I can't imagine what went through their head when they decided the score. Otherwise it got great acting and a decent story but nothing we haven't seen or heard before or after this movie."
abedein7,"Nov 23, 2018",10/10,"Carol Reed's 1949 masterpiece is a story that is perfectly presented through the medium of film. The dark post-war Vienna setting, the soundtrack and the striking cinematography all create the atmosphere of unease which is present throughout. It is a perfect example of why cinema is simply a wonderful way of storytelling as it not only uses words; but also, visuals and music to convey messages, allowing the audience truly to immerse themselves in a story.'The Third Man' is considered one of the greatest films of its era. Whilst the story and characters are very well-written, it is Robert Krasker's expressionist cinematography and Anton Karas' score that render the film so strikingly memorable. To make the death of Harry Lime far more interesting and sinister, Reed chooses to place the film in a weary and politically divided Vienna whose citizens are consequently forced into being more suspicious of the American protagonist Holly Martins, and his investigation into his friend's fate. This lends itself nicely to Krasker as his frequent use of the titled (or Dutch) angle and heavily contrasting black and white frames all reflect and add to the awry nature of the setting and the story. The external shots in the seedy neighbourhoods tend to be lit by moonlight or streetlamps which create vast looming shadows in a crumbling city, making it harder for Martins to investigate his friend's death, as every aspect of Vienna seems as if it does not want to help him. The city, therefore, is not as much a traditional location but rather a character in its own right. Nothing in this film is quite what it seems and every feature of the visual side of the film accentuates Carol Reed's intentions. It is fitting therefore, that in the twist at the end where Harry Lime reveals himself to be still alive, it turns out that he is in fact a malicious and twisted man who perverts the meaning of good and evil, putting him in conflict with his righteous old best friend.It is impossible to talk about 'The Third Man' without mentioning its soundtrack. Like the cinematography, it is one of its most prevalent features. Anton Karas' zither provides an atmospheric score that adds an unexpected romance accompanying the menace. The music's somewhat jaunty nature, however, does not make the film seem upbeat in any way, but rather, like everything else, distorted into something that is unsettling but beautiful. The soundtrack ultimately makes the film the masterpiece that it is since it perfectly complements the dialogue and setting.Reed contrasts the curious yet naïve character of Holly Martins (who symbolises Hollywood America), with the much grimmer local characters forged by the War in Europe. His clean-cut and open face conflicts with the those of the hardened friends of Harry Lime. The majority are either unwilling to help or hostile towards this foreigner scouring the dark streets of Vienna as he investigates Lime's fate. Even Anna Schmidt's face is tainted with past strain and suffering, a contrast to the purity and innocence in the likes of Grace Kelly and Katharine Hepburn, her American contemporaries. Martins writes optimistic western novels that trivialise conflicts into good and evil, whereas the battle-weary characters of Vienna see the world in a far more cynical light. Even the setting reflects this sentiment, with the majority of the film being set in the evening or at night.In many ways, 'The Third Man' is an unromantic observation on the effects of war on its victims. One only has to turn to Orson Welles' now infamous ""Cuckoo clock"" speech to see how Reed accentuates the true difference between the people like Lime and those like Martins. Welles' character believes that with conflict comes innovation and societal progress, compared to a country like Switzerland where ""five hundred years of democracy and peace"" has only produced ""the Cuckoo clock.""'The Third Man' still stands up today as a masterpiece, and there is little wonder why it is widely regarded as the greatest British film of all time. Reed uses every component of filmmaking available to extraordinary effect, illustrating exactly why film is such a marvellous medium of storytelling."
senpai_ray,"Mar 22, 2024",9/10,"I'm not going to talk much about the plot. I will only say that the canvas was very well tailored, and there was not a single moment in the movie that would make me feel like I don't believe in what's happening (though the plot is pretty extravagant).Anyway, it doesn't matter in case of this film, since the magical, enchanting and kind of mysterious atmosphere of the picture leaves no room for something else but delight. Although you get immersed in the action from the get-go, in the whirlpool of events there is always a place for some true romantic events, and a very melancholic spirit is felt throughout the whole movie. The old city of postwar Vienna, where the action takes place, was in my opinion a perfect place to set this kind of feeling, and it plays it's own role here.I can recommend this film (which is one of the most beautiful ever created) to everyone without any exception, but especially - to those who appreciate the feeling of aching loneliness and melancholy in cinema."
basrutten,"Nov 29, 2002",6/10,"After a promising start, ""The Third Man"" quickly degenerates into a slow, boring and predictable mood piece. While the photography of post-WW2 Vienna was absolutely beautiful and the atmosphere very well done, this movie really couldn't keep my attention past the first half.Which is a shame, since it looked like it could have been great. The begin of the plot is intriguing, with lots of unanswered questions and lots of characters that all have a hidden agenda. I was really expecting some kind of ""Usual Suspects"" or ""L.A. Confidential"" - story with lots of depth and twists etc. Unfortunately, the ""mystery"" gets solved about halfway through the movie, and it turns out that it wasn't much of a mystery at all. After that, it's just a long and boring search for the one responsible, and a romance that never gets of.Ultimately, this movie is interesting because of the camera work and the atmosphere, but in terms of story it's a huge disappointment. Oh, and the music is absolutely terrible.** out of **** stars"
ArthurDental,"Dec 30, 2005",6/10,"Photography? Check. Music? Check. Plot and character? Hold your horses.I'm quite surprised at the overwhelmingly thoroughly positive reviews, which led me to this film. In a way, I guess I should be thankful for having the opportunity to enjoy a work that clearly remains a masterful production. However, weaknesses in the writing seriously undermined my enjoyment of the experience. From the moment Holly Martins gave away the identity of a witness, leading very unsurprisingly to the murder of the porter, I knew the script would be either naive or just dumb. To name another flaw, the romance (or more accurately, romantic feelings) between the two leads were matter-of-factly and serves the plot rather than being realistic. Sure, the movie was from a very different era, but I've seen other classic films, and I don't think people were that dumb. Overall, the techniques were quite wonderful and yes, extraordinary, but the script was underwhelming, to say the very least."

lhuffman66,"Sep 24, 2018",10/10,"This is a real gem. I personally think this film gives Citizen Kane a run for its money. The post war setting and mood sets the stage for this mystery perfectly. Wonderfully acted, with Joseph Cotten doing an excellent job as leading man. Trevor Howard is perfect as the patient Major Calloway. The audience is carried through the mystery as an outsider, following Cotton's Holly Martins as he learns of his friend's death and things not adding up. If I am to be critical, some of the sewer chases are a bit tedious, but they do not take away from the film. And what surely has to be one of the best reveals in film history. I truly wish I hadn't known what the twists are ahead of time. However, knowing the story won't make this any less of a great film."
dettwins,"Jun 8, 2024",10/10,"I watch the Third Man every year of two and find it as refreshing as the first time I saw it. The acting is incredibly taut without a weak link and is utterly believable. The cinematography is breathtaking in black and white. This movie has the best plot twist, the best ad lib, the best chase scene and an entirely plausible love interest intertwined with an amazing whodunit. This will always be among my favorite movies and I love how every time I watch it I notice something new. Joseph Cotten sets the tone as Holly (Rollo) Martins. Lime's friends are wonderfully sinister. Trevor Howard's professionalism is spot on. Balling is subtly enticing and real."

The acting, the images and, indeed, the soundtrack are just perfect. Nothing to do with the version I saw in the fifties which was so truncated that it was hard to understand what was going on. Fortunately I saw it again in the Musée du Cinéma at the Palais des Beaux-Arts in Brussels in a much better version. Then I really thought that it was a masterpiece. Watching it now confirms that I was not wrong at the time. Looks like I still need 40 characters to be eligible with this review. So I will finish with two words: Forever Outstanding."
estebangonzalez10,"Jul 18, 2015",10/10,"""I never knew the old Vienna before the war, with its Strauss music, its glamour and easy charm. I really got to know it in the classic period of the black market.""And with that brilliant opening voice over narration we are introduced to this landmark film, which in my opinion outdoes the Germans in its Expressionism. I've fallen in love with Carol Reed's masterpiece, The Third Man, which takes elements from classic film noir and German expressionism creating a timeless classic. To say this is the best British film of all time is an understatement, because it deserves to be considered amongst the very best the world has offered. Everything about this film is perfection, from the opening setting of the plot, to the iconic zither score by Anton Karas that accompanies it (which not in a million years I would've consider to fit this thriller, but it does), to the memorable Ferris wheel scene where Orson Welles delivers his famous ""cuckoo clock"" speech, to Orson Welles's spectacular entrance scene (the best in film history), to the spectacular chase scene through the sewers of Vienna, to the uncountable amount of Dutch angle shots that help build the tense atmosphere accompanied by an unprecedented visual aesthetic from cinematographer Robert Krasker who turns the evocative shadows into a character in this film, to Graham Greene's fantastic screenplay delivering on every twist, to the final long shot that ends the film in a magnificent and memorable way only adding to the romantic fatalism theme of the story. Every single decision made during the production of this film, even those they came across by chance, seems to have worked to perfection. This is not a case where you can say it's style over substance or vice versa, it's one of those rare films where style and substance come together to deliver a perfect visual aesthetic and an intriguing theme with memorable character.The opening narration introduces us to postwar Vienna, a city of bombed buildings and piles of rubble that has been divided into four occupied zones by the victorious allies (British, American, Russian and French). It is a place where opportunists and racketeers have come to make a living in its widespread black market. This is where Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American pulp novelist, enters the scene. He is broke, but has been invited by Harry Lime, a good old friend from his school days, to stay with him in Vienna. Upon his arrival, Holly discovers that Harry has been killed in a traffic accident. Being the mystery novelist that he is, Holly begins to talk to some of Harry's friends who witnessed his accident and discovers some inconsistencies in their stories. He reports these suspicions to Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard), the man in charge of the investigation, but he quickly dismisses him and says he should return home. The Major believes it is best that Harry has died since he was a racketeer who caused many innocent deaths. Holly however becomes intrigued with the case after the porter of Harry's building (Paul Horbiger) tells him there was a third man involved in the scene, but who no one else accounts for. Holly also befriends and falls for Anna (Alida Valli), Harry's lover who had immigrated from Czechoslovakia, which gives him another reason to stay for a few more days to try to uncover the mystery of his friend's untimely death.The film is so visually stunning (it's only Oscar win was for best cinematography) that at times people forget to mention how great Graham Greene's script actually is. He understood this post-war European world and how the black market worked because he himself was a former British spy. That is what makes the story so believable and gives the film its substance. Of course the style is what turns this into a landmark film with its clever shots playing with Dutch angles, lights, smokes, and shadows, its wonderful editing, and its amazing score, but the film has a great plot to go along with it as well as some solid performances. Joseph Cotten delivers a solid role as the lead hero who comes into this world as a naive child believing everything is black and white. He is flawed, he is a drunk who falls in love way too easy. Harry's friends all have faces who at least look very suspicious (Siegfried Breuer as Popescu and Erich Ponto as Dr. Winkel). And then there is Orson Welles himself who with less than 15 minutes of screen time steals the movie. He could've done so with his iconic entrance alone (delivering a perfect smile), which was gorgeously lighted, but he also delivers one of the most memorable quotes of the film as well. Alida Valli also delivers as the femme in this film and it all leads to an exciting finale. For all these reasons and many more which I've failed to put into words, I can affirm that The Third Man is a masterpiece. Let me end this review by citing Orson Welles's memorable speech:""Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.""http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

Acting, music, directing, everything's good, but not that much to put this movie in ranks with the best accomplishments of all times. What makes this movie so special is one of the most deserved Best Cinematography Academy Awards in movie history. Although this movie is from the ancient 1949, cadres, angles, the play of light and shadow are still fascinating even today. Especially at the very end of the movie where grand finale in sewers and epilogue at graveyard left me breathless. In the endless sea of Hollywood hyper-production, it is good to see such a masterpiece every now and then and remind yourself why movies are considered to be a form of art.10/10"

Took a ride on it remembering the great scene with Orson Wells and Joseph Cotton every moment of the way. The actual ride takes about the same ammount of time that it took in the film,roughly about 15 minutes. Being that the city has been almost completely rebuilt since the film was shot there, the doorway where Orson Wells (Harry Lyme) appears is no longer in existence. Wonderful nostalgia for a wonderful, unforgettable film."

The background score that is critically acclaimed does not even suit the genre of this movie and at sometimes is so bad you wished there was no background score at all. And finally add to this a plot that can be showcased in 15 minutes stretched over 2 hours - one will be bored to death. The plot is good for a thriller movie. Unfortunately the main twist reveal is botched so bad that the viewer knows beforehand and the reveal falls flat. With the main twist reveal happening midway, rest of the movie is a complete drag. Overall, this is one of those Emperor's new clothes kind of movie where some critics praised the movie just because it was different and the rest just parroted the hype."

I love classic films, but much about this one doesn't appeal to my personal tastes. For example, I have a hard time warming up to Joseph Cotten as a leading man. For me, he spoils Hitchcock's brilliant ""Shadow of a Doubt"" and I could do without him in ""Citizen Kane."" Alida Valli is a fine actress, but her close resemblance to Karen Black prevents me from finding her attractive. The incessant zither music quickly wears out its welcome, as do the overused tilted camera angles of people running through empty streets and sewers. With that said, I was finally able to focus and understand what was going on. The mystery, for all its sound and fury, signifies not much. Even Orson Welles's fifteen minutes of screen time is redundant. I do admire the craftsmanship of this film and can see why some people love it, but I feel the whole experience is rather dissatisfying. Watching it feels more like a highly demanding chore rather than a pleasure."

Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), is by far what makes Black & White films entertaining as well as exciting! The film stars Joseph Cotten, Valli and Orson Welles. The locations in the city of Vienna, Austria are quite impressive. Welles has so much to handle as his famous character, Harry Lime.There was a concern from David O'Selznick over the casting of Orson Welles. Welles had a struggling career, after the making of ""Citizen Kane"", but Reed found Welles to be the right fit for the main project. The ending of this movie is a true work of Art, and the tension is certainly there for its audience. The Cinematography is what really makes this film work. The trick is that everything is uneven, and Cotten has a hard time pronouncing certain character's names.The film earned the award for Best Cinematography. While Welles was back in the game, he still struggled to gain his independence as a film director.

It's just that no one else has ever offered a cleaner version of this film. After suffering for years with lousy VHS transfers of this gem, it was nice to see it given justice.To me, the visuals here make this DVD worth owning because the story is okay, but nothing super. To an average first-time viewer, the first hour of this film can drag. I found that to be the case on my first viewing, but the more I watch this, the better the story seems to have gotten for some reason. Despite his billing, Orson Welles has a small role in here. He doesn't even appear until after 65 of the film's 104 minutes have elapsed. Meanwhile, Joseph Cotten dominates the story, along with Alida Valli, sort of a poor man's Ingrid Bergman. Those two are okay but the story picks up dramatically after Wells finally appears.In addition to the fabulous cinematography, an unique feature of this movie is the music, which is very strange for a film noir. It's lighthearted music from a zither, almost circus-like in its sound and melody....but I liked it. It helps make this movie different.The visuals involve a lot of nighttime photography, lots of shadows and cobblestone streets.

The opening titles with Anton Karas' zither music sets the scene for the masterpiece that follows,from the opening line of "" I never knew the old Vienna..."" to the heartbreaking final two minute scene when the beautiful Alida Valli silently walks past Joseph Cotten in the cemetery while the zither music winds up the tension like a clock spring. There is just no excuse not to reach for the kleenex and have a good weep. There is nothing in this film that can be improved. The script is packed with great lines, the cast ( of mostly obscure international bit-part actors )aren't allowed to detract from the power of the film. The direction is so tight that in places it seems as though the scenes are being ad-libbed. Orson Welles has been justifiably credited for his mesmeric performance as Harry Lime, his first appearance as the window light crosses his face as he stands in the shadow of a doorway still makes the hair stand on my neck. There is no comparable scene in all of cinema. It is a brilliant moment that has been imitated but never bettered. If you have never seen this film you are missing out on what is an object lesson in perfection, every child should watch this film instead of Star Wars."
elentjr,"Dec 6, 2005",10/10,"I first saw the film in 1949. I loved it but was not mature enough to fully appreciate it. Saw it tonight 6 December, 2005. How much more I saw and understood and felt this time. Wonderful- it redefines the term Dark Romance.Four superb actors working under the great Carol Reed, photographed by the Krasker - a brilliant constellation!Another curious conjunction; like Valli, I was born on May 31, 1921, like Valli I have theater in my background. Geminis you know.Seeing the film I vowed that someday I too would ride the great wheel of Vienna and gaze down upon the ""dots"". Twenty years later I made that dream come true.

I_Ailurophile,"May 24, 2024",9/10,"I must say, I find myself surprised. This film carries an extremely high reputation, and moreover carries the very high favor and recommendation of people I know, and while I sat to watch with no foreknowledge, it's not what I had supposed it might be sights unseen. Anton Karas' music, greeting us from the outset, is utterly brilliant and ultimately marvelously effective, yet couldn't be further from the norm for crime thriller or film noir with its softly melodic and often upbeat chords. Except where they are specifically employed to artistic ends to bolster the shot composition I don't necessarily think much of those famous, proliferate, dramatic Dutch angles - I can easily envisage a parody, and it's not too far removed - yet with that said, at large this is plainly stupendous in how it was shot. Between the stunning filming locations, exquisite use of lighting and shadow, Robert Krasker's fantastically smart cinematography, and Carol Reed's truly impeccable direction, wide swaths of 'The third man' could be picked out frame by frame and either hung on a wall or slapped inside a coffee table book, for it is crafted with a masterful sense of artistry that at its best is altogether breath-taking. And I freely admit I spent pretty much the first half of these 104 minutes rather unconvinced: even as shady suggestions pervaded each scene, at first the story of Holly's amateur investigation wasn't gelling in an especially hardy or compelling manner, and the seeming introduction of an obligatory romantic element only met with a tired sigh as a trope I often find decidedly thin.Yet when the narrative does shift around the halfway mark, or shortly thereafter, the plot kicks into high gear and the increasingly becomes intensely absorbing. One important midway scene of exposition puts (most of) the first half into perspective, and from thereon the picture plainly dazzles in every capacity as the story heads toward its conclusion. Emotional beats hit harder, some ingenious subtlety shines through at select points, and just as Orson Welles once again affirms the presence and nuance he wielded as an actor, other core cast members Joseph Cotten, Alida Valli, and even Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee more readily impress with their performances. That romantic element is ultimately treated in a manner that is immensely satisfying, to the point that I wish other filmmakers could be so smart about it in their own works. Well made in general, with terrific contributions from all those behind the scenes, the lofty esteem in which the feature is held is firmly validated, and any discussion of 'The third man' becomes not one about its indisputable level of quality but personal perspectives on relative strengths and weaknesses - whatever that means, on an individual level, for something operating on this level. It's also important to observe how casually but definitively the movie speaks to post-war Vienna as celebrated writer Graham Greene very organically weaves glimpses of the period into the story and its characters, just as Reed and Krasker give us eyefuls of the city in the wake of the destructiveness of a few years before. And on a tangential note, it's very much worth observing that Welles' role is one that is readily, perfectly identifiable in 2024, which means that in addition to being altogether excellent the whole production continues to be horrifyingly relevant.Those who had recommended this to me, or who have spoken of it in grand terms, do not jest. I think there are interesting points to raise of what is extra sharp here or perhaps not so sharp, but this is completely separate from the incontrovertible fact of how superb the title is when all is said and done. Others have written far more about 'The third man,' and more eloquently, but allow me as a layperson but an avid cinephile to confirm that this is continues to stand tall as an outstanding, greatly satisfying classic, and anyone who enjoys watching films owes it to themselves to watch at least once. That's really all there is to it."
Kirpianuscus,"Aug 8, 2023",N/A,"The easy temptation is to define it as a classic or a masterpiece. And, indeed, it is one. The first appearence of Henry Lime is a good proof.But one of its great virtues is to remind in fair - precise manner, the Europe after war.And IT does it in admirable manner, offering to a film noir more than expected tension, moral dilemmas or the hero in charge.Using its three basic pillars - Coltrane, Alida Vali and Orson Welles, it offers a clear perspective about post war traumas, survive, compromise, cynical corruption, friendship and unconditional love and, sure, the Iron Curtain.A great, în profound sense, film . For supporting characters as a sort of Greek choir, for the sketch of tragedy of Comunism and for the beautiful, grace to music, to, final."
chera_khalid,"Oct 23, 2025",7/10,"I thought this movie was good. Carol Reed's direction creates a moody, atmospheric thriller set in post-war Vienna, full of shadows, intrigue, and tension. The story of Holly Martins investigating the mysterious death of his friend Harry Lime is engaging and full of clever twists, keeping the audience guessing.Orson Welles gives a magnetic performance as Harry Lime, while Joseph Cotten brings charm and nuance to Holly Martins. The supporting cast is strong, enhancing the depth of the story.Cinematography is exceptional, with striking use of light and shadow that adds to the suspense and mood. The famous zither score by Anton Karas perfectly complements the film's unique tone. Some pacing is a bit slow in parts, but it adds to the suspenseful build-up rather than detracting from the story.Overall, The Third Man is a stylish, well-crafted thriller with memorable performances and a haunting atmosphere. A classic worth watching."
jldmp1,"Sep 27, 2006",6/10,"The good: Reed did show off one resonant idea here - the congruence of the visual narrative with the story. That is to say, the unsettling effect produced by the camera's tilt off the vertical axis that nicely reinforces the notion that 'nothing and no one is who he seems'.The not so good: whatever noir value this had has long since been superseded and bettered (the concept of ""noir"" was named by the French after a series of crime novels published with black covers, and would refer to authors such as Raymond Chandler and Dashiell Hammett). This movie worked at the beginning of the Cold War, because of the audience's recognition of new political complexities, and especially the growing influence of espionage and Orwellian disinformation.But not any more. What we get is a hack actor carrying the role of a hack writer in a foreign city whence so much art and culture originated. And Reed is just as uncultured as Cotten when it comes to handling the locals. It's as if the cinematic touches and the world which they reflect don't match at all.Welles and Howard can hold up their end no sweat, but that's not enough to carry this today. ""Foreign Correspondent"" and ""The Big Clock"" have more staying power. See this for its historical value, only."
AJ_McAninch,"Mar 2, 2019",10/10,"There is nothing I can add to the praise, just my admiration, especially for the last 15 minutes of purest cinematic artistry. Breathtaking."
Zooha-47207,"Apr 13, 2025",7/10,"The Third Man is often hailed as one of the greatest films of all time, but for modern audiences, it might be a bit underwhelming. Sure, the film has fantastic cinematography for its time, and the performances from Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten are solid, but the story itself doesn't pack the punch that other classics do. Set in post-World War II Vienna, the film explores themes of corruption, betrayal, and the moral ambiguity of its characters. While it's undoubtedly a historical piece of cinema, its slow pace and convoluted plot can make it feel a bit tedious.What truly stands out about the film is its iconic use of shadows and lighting, which adds a layer of suspense and mystery. The atmospheric tension is palpable, especially in the famous chase scene through the sewers.However, when it comes to the narrative, it feels like it drags on a bit too much, and the payoff isn't quite as satisfying as you might expect. It's a significant piece of film history, but not the best for casual movie-goers."
greenforest56,"Aug 26, 2005",5/10,"If you are interested in film production and want to know how important the score is  watch this film.The sole instrument in the score is a zither. The music sounds clownish and one expects clowns to show up at any moment. Quite inappropriate in a tense, dark drama. The awkward music draws the passion and darkness out of every scene it appears in, ruining some fairly good performances. Thankfully, the score is fairly minimal.Lesson: Low budget? If you must have only one instrument, pick a piano, not a zither, to orchestrate your film. Or spend a little more money on the score....There is also some emotional confusion in this film. Harry Lime, we are lead to believe, is a sleezeball worthy of death. However, he managed to win the love, and loyalty, of a beautiful woman of character and the lifelong friendship, and loyalty (he tried to find out who murdered Lime) of another fairly good guy.Sleezeballs worthy of death don't earn the loyalty of people like that. They earn the 'loyalty' of other sleezeballs.So, you wonder, is he really a sleezeball or a hero up to something important just masquerading as a sleezeball? You don't really know until the end of the movie. This leads to confusion, not suspense."
JaneBingley,"Sep 17, 2022",9/10,"An amazing movie, which will never age.Joseph Cotten and Orson Wells, the former brilliant, the latter brilliant because of his extreme love for his craft.Being a murder mystery of sorts, one of The Third Man's most important assets is its plot.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten), an American churner-out of trashy Western novels, arrives in the Austrian capital some time after the end of the Second World War. He's been invited there by Harry Lime, an old friend, who wants him to take on a job of some description.But the day he arrives is the day Lime is to be buried: his friend was knocked down by a car less than a week ago. At the funeral, he meets Major Calloway (Trevor Howard), a British policeman, who tells him that his late friend was a racketeer. Martins doesn't believe him. Furthermore, he is sceptical of the circumstances surrounding Lime's death - how did four of his acquaintances just happen to be at the scene?He becomes hung up on the identity of the mysterious ""third man"" who, according to the porter at Lime's tenement building, helped carry the body to the pavement."
bk753,"Dec 28, 2023",9/10,"I didn't quite love this movie as much as I hoped to, but my appreciation for the art and visuals is absolutely boundless. The feel of desperation in post-war Vienna is everywhere, the stunning B&W cinematography is flawless, and the acting is top shelf. I did find the pacing at times to be a little slow, and there wasn't the degree of suspense that I was hoping for, but neither of these detract from this Carol Reed / Graham Greene film noir masterpiece.Joseph Cotton is stellar as a hack American author turned sleuth, and Alida Valli shines as the love interest of Cotton's newly deceased friend, Harry Lime (played to perfection by Orson Welles). Since Welles was listed as a main star, we knew he had to turn up eventually... I thought it'd be in a series of flashbacks, but not so.The story is good, but this film should be seen and appreciated for the visuals and on-screen depiction of a post-war Europe at the onset of the Cold War. In this regard, it is unparalleled."
barryrd,"Nov 30, 2021",8/10,"The Third Man is a fascinating movie with superb photography. The story follows Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins to post-war Vienna where he is looking for an old friend named Harry Lime, played by Orson Welles. It should be pointed out that crime and the black market are running wild in Vienna at the time. Lime doesn't show up as expected and Martins is told that Lime is dead, as a result of an accident. Martins strongly suspects something is amiss and Lime is at the top of the police hit list. Conflicting versions of the accident send him on a long chase. He even attends a funeral for his friend. One would think this is the final word on Lime's whereabouts; however, the chase continues. Through the backstreets and alleyways of Vienna, the audience sees some excellent shots, almost like a series of great photographs in black and white. The realist atmosphere is reinforced by the darkness, shadows, and damp cobblestone streets of the once glamorous capital of Vienna. A frantic chase through the underground sewer system and a ride on the famed Ferris wheel are part of this fast paced movie. There are many fine cast members like Valli, as Harry's former female companion, not to mention the chief of police played by Trevor Howard, as well as Wilfrid Hyde-Whyte and Bernard Lee. (Lee would later become ""M"", James Bond's London espionage contact.) All in all, a movie that movie buffs should consider seeing. It is often included among the greatest films of all time. To me it's a very good movie that ranks in the top 100. A great art house movie but not the greatest of all time."

HuntinPeck80,"Apr 27, 2024",9/10,"According to Wiki, legendary film critic Roger Ebert said, ""Has there ever been a film where the music more perfectly suited the action than in Carol Reed's The Third Man? And yet recently I heard a Youtuber, one of those reactions video people, describe the music as ""obnoxious"", also inappropriate to the film's subject. Hmmm. Wiki also reports this: In Britain it's a thriller about friendship and betrayal. In Vienna it's a tragedy about Austria's troubled relationship with its past."" Different places, different times, different people - different viewpoints. I guess that's right for a film whose protagonist attracts such wildly different characterisations and confused emotions.It's fascinating to see post-WW2 Vienna in this movie. The sewer scenes, or some, were shot in UK at Shepperton, and probably some interior scenes. Vienna is a magnificent, surreal bomb site of a city, with a bizarre collision of nationalities and everything flipped from official to unofficial, clean to black market, or simply everything is in the grey, trying to survive and struggle on. The zither music, for me, aside from being a unique cinematic attribute, allows the movie a kind of queasy humour, as if dignified proceedings were taking place in a world of carnival and farce. Certainly there's nothing cliched about the music, nor the movie's ending (director Carol Reed had to fight to hold onto the ending as shown).I don't think I liked this film when I was a boy. Not enough action. Maybe too much Viennese melancholy. Getting older can mean becoming freer with regard to certain things, even as one becomes fussier and habit-bound. I watch the character played by Joseph Cotton, pulp novelist Holly Martins, playing detective and wallowing in his hopeless love, with a good deal of headshaking sympathy. Looking at Alida Valli, in the role of Anna Schmidt, it's easy to see why he'd fall so hard. She's Italian, by the way, playing a Czech pretending to be Austrian (or German); anything to avoid the Russian authorities. Magnificent because, not inspite of, limited screen time, is Orson Welles as Harry Lime. This is a bit like Sir Anthony Hopkin's brief, Oscar-winning turn in The Silence of the Lambs, but with more flattering costume and lighting. British actor Trevor Howard is unrecognisable from the soppy lover in Brief Encounter, and it's nice to see Bond movie legends Bernard Lee and Geoffrey Keen in smaller roles.The Third Man, which in case I forgot to mention is all about an American trying to investigate the shady circumstances of his shady friend's death, conveys a good deal of feeling, contained emotion, without sentimentality. Sang froid and a few doses of drunken self pity, and some low key humour, such as the scene where four nationalities of police come to arrest Anna, the Russian stern, the German demanding, the British sympathetic, the French making sure the lady doesn't forget her lipstick. The film also doesn't go in for explicitness, so, as an example, the visit to the hospital ward is neither maudlin nor grotesque, leaving the horrible results of the contaminated Penicillin to our imagination. The askew camera work also cements the image of a world rocked by a massive earthquake, WW2.Ok, so it's a legendary classic. Wiki informs us that the BFI voted it, in 1999, the Greatest British Film. I'd never really thought of it as a British film, but then the Americans think of Game of Thrones as an American thing, despite the largely British cast, European settings and fantasy-medieval world. We don't always know who we're dealing with, do we Harry?"
mmintz,"Oct 31, 2001",7/10,"The negatives of this movie must be blinding!  ""The Third Man"" is as dark as it gets.  It is a very interesting experiment in Modernism.  Up is down and down is up.  ""You've got everything upside down,"" one character says to another and in those five words we have the motivating idea of the movie. And, closely related, is the breakdown of the hero concept.  ""The world doesn't make heroes,"" Orson Welles says.  Nevertheless, with an arguable amount of success, Holly Martins tries to be one.  This is part of what keeps ""The Third Man"" from being completely bleak.  Holly Martins search for ""the truth"" looks forward to that of Frank Bigelow, the protagonist of the next year's Noir classic ""D.O.A.""  Both men are sent hither and thither (amidst environments that range from the indifferent to the down-right unfriendly) to retrace the details of a crime whose trail of clue's is quickly growing cold.One of the most conspicuous aspects of the movie is the heavy use of canted camera angles.  Usually, camera techniques are lost on the average viewer, but you can't miss it in this one.  The average conversation bounces back between two characters, one with a thirty degree tilt to the left and the other with a thirty degree tilt to the right.  Simple but effective.And you can't miss that ubiquitous zither music.  Annoying: yes.  To be sure.  But, the fact that it doesn't really seem to ever fit the images gives ""The Third Man"" a surreal, exotic feel.  Nevertheless, I still think they could've gotten the feel and spared us a few of those annoying, manic tunes.Finally, Orson Welles, of course, is great.  His two most memorable scenes are the one with the kitten in the doorway and the ferris wheel scene.  In his first shot, Orson's cherubic, mischievous visage lets us know immediately the plot is getting thicker than a Sequoia.On the ferris wheel, Orson perfectly embodies that villainous archetype: the Rotten Bad Guy with the Great Lines.  Here he voices an idea that (while interesting, has been taken way too seriously):  ""Nobody thinks in terms of human beings.  Governments don't.  Why should we?""  And Cotton's response (through the rest of the movie): ""Well, I don't really know but I will anyway.""  This is the response (never actually verbalized) that motivates every anti-hero hero from Sam Marlowe to Detective William Somerset (Morgan Freeman's character in Se7en).  Good answer!"
Bernie4444,"Apr 13, 2024",10/10,"This is one of those films that everyone thought he/she saw. This is of course because of all the popular actors and directors. Of those viewers that have seen this film, they will never forget.The default version is the U. K. version. However, you can see the different versions compared to the DVD extras. Speaking about extras, one of the best extras is that of the abbreviated play being read voice-over the film. I definitely ordered the book.There is a Kindle version that has interspersed movie clips and describes the differences in the book and movie.This film is presented in black and white. You can see how tight the presentation is without a wasted word or glance. Music is also one of the main characters of the film. I only remember the Blu-ray version so I cannot tell the quality of the other versions.Even though the book looks from the view of Major Calloway (Trevor Howard in the film) and the film from the view of Holly Martins, it is the character of Sergeant Paine (Bernard Lee) that we find endearing.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) an out-of-work novelist (Westerns) is offered a job in post-war Vienna by his friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles). When Holly arrives, he finds he is late for Harry's funeral. The authorities are besmirching Harry's memory.

redkiwi,"Sep 24, 2000",6/10,"I must admit I was more than a little disappointed with this film, it really didn't live up to what I'd expected, and is nowhere near in the league of Welles' classic Citizen Kane.To be 100% fair, I probably didn't help myself by buying the commemorational video with all the previews at the start, and the features on the music.  By the time the film started I absolutely hated the music, it was driving me insane - so it took me a week to watch the video!Welles is competent - and definitely has that streak that made Kane such a compelling character - as the smuggler come drug thief in this tale of post war Vienna, but this film just didn't grab me as being anything special at any time."
Anonymous_Maxine,"Jun 9, 2000",10/10,"Orson Welles is excellent as Harry Lime, a man who invites his friend Holly Martins to visit him in Vienna from his home in the United States. When Holly arrives, he learns that Harry has been killed in a car accident. When he tries to find out more about the accident that killed his friend, Holly encounters surprisingly strong opposition.The Third Man is put together amazingly well and contains some truly amazing cinematography, including several scenes on the war-torn streets of Vienna. Maybe the most unusual quality of this film is the fact that it is pulled along mostly by the quality of the story, rather than star actors or special effects (which were, of course, much less common in 1949 than they are today). The story is so complex and well-told that it almost overshadows even such stars (in true ""star roles"") as Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten. The Third Man is a classic post-war film. It is amazingly well done, and should not be missed."
TheLittleSongbird,"Sep 27, 2010",10/10,"The Third Man is really quite a brilliant film, and one of the best British films ever made in my opinion. There are several reasons why I think this. The cinematography is just outstanding, and helps fashion a city full of menace and the score is jaunty and flawlessly echoes the film's wit and drama. Then there is a dark yet playful script(two other words to describe the film itself too), impeccable direction from master of place, angle and shade Carol Reed and a gem of a story that grips you right up till the ending. The Third Man is also blessed with performances more perfect than you can ask for from Joseph Cotten and especially Orson Welles. Overall, it is a brilliant film, very well made and has a great story. 10/10 Bethany Cox"
Mankin,"May 10, 1999",N/A,"I've always thought ""The Third Man"" (**1/2 out of ****) one of the most overrated movies I've ever seen 4 or 5 times.  Setting aside the admittedly dazzling photography and editing, we have a plot that's as difficult to follow and riddled with holes and loose ends as the one for ""The Big Sleep."" If we assume that Harry Lime is the ""third man"" who drove the truck that killed the medical orderly that was informing on him to the police (in fact, this is never made clear), wouldn't it have been a simple matter for the authorities (or anyone else) to identify the body and discover that it was not Harry Lime?  Didn't the police interview the driver of the truck?  How could Lime and his cohorts have possibly gotten away with the faking of his death when he was the most notorious and sought after racketeer in Vienna? The pretext for Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) being in the city at all is awfully weak.  (The narration mentions a vague ""some sort of a job."")  Why would Harry want a friend from America that he hasn't seen for 10 years to come to Vienna to write about his operations?  The less publicity the better it would seem to me.  It's also extremely ambiguous whether or not his mistress (Alida Valli) knew that Harry was dead.  The first time that Martins sees Lime he's lingering outside her apartment house as if waiting to go in, and then she does everything she can to make sure that Harry eludes the authorities.  In fact, her obtuse behavior throughout the film is baffling. (I'm inclined to believe that she was in on the whole deception.) Perhaps Carol Reed and co. needed audacious cinematic razzle-dazzle and oblique dialogue to cover up the fact that their story makes minimal sense. And that jangling zither music!  Time and again it intrudes upon scenes that were meant to evoke tension and atmosphere and dissipates both.  After the 4th or 5th repetition of the ""Third Man Theme"", I was ready to turn on the ""mute"" button!  (These comments are based on the original 104 minute version.)"

And look out for the strong supporting roles (Trevor Howard's cynical army officer through to Wilfred Hyde White's slightly dotty cultural liaison officer).

HabaneroBuck,"Sep 25, 2008",5/10,"Watched it last night. I was not engrossed, which surprised me. The main character is a writer of some sort, but he completely lacks imagination. He's entirely straight-forward, utterly lacking in the nuanced sophistication that makes for a good investigator. The motivations of many of the characters are dubious at best, such as the appearance of the Third Man. Orson Welles did fine, but the role is not as legendary and epic as we are lead to believe. Not seeing this film will not make one any less of a film connoisseur.The camera-work, shadows, and atmosphere are to be commended. The actors other than Joseph Cotten are very good. Overall, it makes for a ""so-so"" film by today's standards. Some older films created tension quite well, but this film simply doesn't, which is probably a prerequisite for a thriller to succeed, no?"
MightyGorga,"May 22, 1999",10/10,"The Third Man is easily the best example of the noir genre, and may well be the best single movie ever made.  The greatest reason for this: Orson Welles.  Off screen for almost two-thirds of the movie, he's nevertheless the most intimidating villain in screen history; you know nothing of what to expect from him, because he is evil incarnate.  Furthermore, Greene and Korda's script awes me.  For an example of how to write suspense better than one could imagine, read the scene in the Ferris Wheel car.  This film is all-around sublime."

Every detail is perfect too. Many are unrepeatable. We will never see bombed out Vienna again, and certainly not like Carol Reed showed it. Then there is Holly Martins, the pulp fiction writer in a pulp fiction noir movie written by Graham Greene, and Orson Welles with the best entrance in the history of movies and just one scene where he talks, but he talks for eternity. And it goes on and on, but I've reached my ten lines. They don't make them like they used to..."
Tobeshadow,"Nov 19, 2021",10/10,"One of the first films I can consciously remember watching, sat next to my Dad in front of a tiny television. I didn't understand the plot but the black and white images were hypnotising. Carol Reed's classic really is a gift for any cinema lover. Anton Karas' iconic zither score winds its way throughout the film and perfectly accentuates the backdrop of a war-torn and ruined Vienna, itself populated by the superb cast of characters.The closing scenes in the sewers demonstrate a mastery of the black and white format, with the phenomenal photography from the great Robert Krasker perfectly highlighting the contrast of shadows and light. There's also some unbelievable editing that consistently ratchets up the pace and tension to the famous climax.Even after 70 years, The Third Man is still as exciting, seedy and thoroughly immersive as ever and superbly demonstrates the inherent magic and power of the silver screen."
Coolassmoviereviews77,"Aug 18, 2025",7/10,"I watched this movie 3 days ago, after waking up from a hangover at 3:33am, and firstly the fact remands the movie's photography is insanely beautiful the acting naturalistic & excellent, the story mysterious, intriguing, the setting a magical apocalyptic labyrinth.But the incessant zither soundtrack made me want to climb down a storm drain and scream bloody murder, why did they want to neuter every scene to have a feeling of someone slipping on a banana peel and falling down a manhole.For such a melancholic story of betrayal set in war torn Vienna, they really beat you over the head with a blithe curb your enthusiasm day at the park pay to make them stop busker nails on a chalkboard brutality which is the heartbeat and veins of this movie which is otherwise excellent.You could pause the film at any timecode and find a frame that would make a class of film students twitch at the bit to analyze and dissect, truly great cinematography.They say Carol Reed was smoked out on Benzedrine during the making of this movie and he found the artist in a nightclub in vienna and INSISTED they score the entirety of the film, 100% alone. With nothing but a zither truly the sound of a migraine, destroy any suspense or devastation of the characters with the whimsy of a baguetted french man twisting his mustachio while thinking how get out of this conundrum by tapping his chin

jc1305us,"Mar 24, 2023",10/10,"As cynical and hard edged as any noir...but with many funny moments thrown in as well. Graham Greene's only screenplay is an all time classic on its own, but throw in Joseph Cotten, Trevor Howard, Alida Valli, and of course Orson Welles, it becomes one of the all time greats.Holly Martins is a broke writer, who has arrived in post war Vienna at the behest of his dear friend, Harry Lime, (Orson Welles) on the promise of work. Arriving in a foreign city, which, just happens to be under occupied rule by 4 separate nations, Holly is confused to not be met by his friend. Only later on does he learn that his friend was killed by a car careening out of control. Dazed, he tries to make sense of the news, and wants to find anyone that can help him find out more about his late friend. What he finds, however, will shatter his world, and the friendship he thought was the best in his life.If you have not seen this film, please do yourself a favor and watch it. It is so well acted, and directed, that even Vienna and it's denizens become another character unto themselves, all with secrets to keep.Remember, ""Don't be so gloomy...In Italy for 30 years under the Borgias, they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland, they had 500 years of democracy and peace. And what did they produce? The cuckoo clock"""
jon_pratt12345,"Feb 17, 2021",7/10,Set around the mysterious death of a well known local figure in post war Vienna. The film sets you up to distrust everyone with various competing international and personal agendas creating tension and is often shot off kilter giving an uneasy feeling. The motivations of the lead characters were sometimes unconvincing as they participated in the mystery with fluctuating commitment but the acting and story were good enough to overlook this. Less easy to overlook was the upbeat musical score which a friend described as sounding like it was from a bad Italian restaurant; it played relentlessly throughout the film regardless of what was happening on screen which was off-putting at times. Overall though it was a fun watch and a gripping final 30 minutes in particular.
RonellSowes,"May 18, 2022",9/10,"The Third Man is one of the most rhythmic films and from the Vienna locations to the Dutch Angles to the all zither score, it also has an unmistakable and for many, highly intriguing atmosphere. Which contribute to the the entire style Carol Reed gave it. The film's strongpoints however, lie not only in the more abstract but also in the cast featuring Joseph Cotten, Valli, Trevor Howard(among others) and Graham Greene's script which both lead us towards the final and most memorable aspect-Orson Welles.Even Greene admitted the best scene was the ferris wheel one which he didn't even write; Welles did. Though only a bit part Orson Welles brings all his charm, skill and (to use an overused word) genius to the role of Harry Lime and creates not just the highlight of this film but one of the most iconic moments in all of cinema."
graxgra,"Jan 12, 2017",5/10,"Since this movie appeared on the IMDb top rated movies list, I felt obliged to watch it, so last night I settled in to be blown away by a what has been described as a film noir classic. Instead of film noir, I saw film nu-uh.The black and white film is generally well shot and pretty to look at - with the occasional hilariously fake car scene - one scene with 3 or 4 men in a jeep early in the film in particular stands out in my mind, as it almost looks like the actors are inwardly cringing, knowing how fake the scene is going to look. Nevertheless this is a comic distraction that can be written off as a technical limitation from the time the movie was made, and indeed many modern films and TV shows still haven't mastered a realistic car scene.The flow of the plot reveals contrivance after contrivance. Some of the acting borders on pantomime - in one early street scene there are several ""watchers"" on the sidewalk, or in apartment windows or shadowy corners, who cast what are supposed to be surreptitious glances towards the action, ""subtly"" looking away or appearing to mind their own business when they sensed they are being noticed. Gee, do you think these people might know something the guy on the street doesn't??Two thirds of the way through the film, the ""twist"" or the ""Third Man"" in the plot is revealed, and by the time the end of the film arrives, it is obvious that the twist made no sense. In a real life situation, the Third Man has no reason to reveal himself, in actual fact it would be completely detrimental (dare I say suicidal?) to his own interests to reveal himself. Towards the end of the film we are watching an underground chase scene, which is really just a long montage of a chased man looked desperate in a tunnel and policemen climbing down manholes and shining torches into the darkness. The way this scene ends is comically flawed and loses its last piece of credibility when lead policeman literally forgets about chasing the criminal to attend to a friend, complete with a pantomime shaking of his head as he snaps out of it and realises that he is still supposed to be involved in a chase.I'm prepared to make allowances for an old film and shrug off its technical flaws or inadequacies and accept the cultural and artistic aspects that link it to a certain time. However the flimsy plot of The Third Man is its achilles heel. I also found the constant switching of languages (particularly early in the film) to be quite jarring and wasn't a fan of the frequent zither throughout the soundtrack.Having said all of that, there are a few likable aspects to The Third Man. Every now and then there is snappy line of dialogue that makes you smile and some of the minor parts, particularly those played by Siegfried Breuer & Ernst Deutsch are roguishly charming, and it is at these times the film does shine briefly as these character actors are free to beguile and charm. And I must finally say that the final scene of the movie does actually achieve one lone moment of classic film noir - it is beautifully shot and is a genuinely classic scene complete with the lighting of a cigarette as the film fades out."
Philipp_Flersheim,"Dec 16, 2021",9/10,"This film is a piece of art. Everything about it contributes: the stunning photography, the music, the acting - it all comes together to make watching it a truly memorable experience that takes you back to post-war Vienna. What impressed me most was the photography. The black and white (colourising the picture would be a crime), the shadows and the glistening wet cobblestones make you feel the cold and damp, and the fact that some parts are shot from an angle adds to the feeling of disorientation. The haunting zither music is inspired (zither is a traditional instrument in that part of the world). Add to that a gripping storyline focused on black-marketeering and the trade in stolen penicillin and fantastic actors (watch out for how Orson Welles' face appears out of the shadows when he is first seen), and you get a film on par with the best."
Himadri,"Jul 21, 1999",10/10,"Everything comes together perfectly. There's Robert Krasker's startling photography; Anton Karas' zither music; superbly paced direction from Carol Reed (who would have thought that final shot would come off so superbly?); Graham Greene's razor-sharp script; and the performances: Joseph Cotten, Allida Valli, and the much underrated Trevor Howard. Even in the minor roles, Bernard Lee and Wilfred Hyde-White provide some ofthe best comic relief I've seen. And, of course, Orson Welles, in surely the greatest cameo performance ever - full of irresistible charm while dripping with evil.And yet, the whole is actually GREATER than the considerable sum of its parts. This film is touched with  rare magic - something you can't quite put your finger on, but is there all the same. Every single scene is magnificent; the timing and pacing are absolute perfection. And, just when you think you've seen it all, there's that final scene....."
hedgehog-10,"Dec 28, 1999",10/10,"A film with such excellent cinematography is a must to see, an example of how important a part this plays in this film is the sewer chase at the film's climax. When the hand reaches through the grate, you can feel the cold air and the atmosphere of the immediate post-war Vienna.On top of this you have an excellent group of actors, and a good script. Bernard Lee's role as the pulp western reading Sergeant is one of my favourites, and an example of the role he could do before the James Bond days.As another comment said, this is a film way ahead of the time it was made and this fact just illustrates why this film is so highly regarded some 50 years after it was made."

ozjeppe,"Mar 28, 2007",7/10,"Another gap finally filled in my viewing catalog! The mood and setting is almost everything in this classic of American writer Cotten tracing his childhood friend Welles in post-WW2 Vienna, with a wrap-up no one could've dreamed of. Starts slowly but builds surely into an enthralling and entertaining mystery thriller in the best Hitchcock tradition, with fine characters and striking noir photography. The climax in the sewers is impressive, but my favourite bit is the fantastic scene in the ferris wheel between Welles & Cotten!Now for my complaint: the music theme. I know it's famous because it stands out- but I seriously find it SO out of place in its la-di-da strut, that it wrecks the thriller mood, and I'm convinced this would have fared even better with a different score. Nonetheless- an essential cinematic staple, indeed.7 out of 10 from Ozjeppe"
braco,"Aug 2, 1998",10/10,"""The Third Man"" is a classic film and one of my favorites. It has a great story development with great unforgettable characters (Holly, Anna, Harry). I've never heard music in a movie that fits so good in the story (not even great Hermann acheivements in ""North By Northwest"" and ""Psycho""). It contains great scenes that engrave themselves in one's mind. Nobody should miss this movie. It really is immortal."
dsimon07,"Dec 5, 2005",7/10,"Really awesome shots. All the tilting lets you know something strange is going on, but I still fell asleep for 10 minutes. Not a superlative film, as has been said the soundtrack is annoying and the plot is stretched 10 minutes too long. Also I wouldn't really call it film noir, as Netflix does, nearly 75% of the film happens in well-lit interiors or daytime streets of Vienna and although we're ostensibly seeing the Viennese ""underworld"" in action, it's all a little too civilized (and British) to count as American film noir. All in all, worth a look if you like classics.One minor note, I recently watched Porter's ""Laura"" for a film class and this movie, which came out 4 or 5 years after ""The Third Man"" is clearly inspired somewhat by this one. A great B-movie that should have been A-list, check out ""Laura"" if you like ""The Third Man"" or vice versa."
sarah_pierzchala,"Jun 4, 2024",10/10,"Recently re-watched this and was blown away by how much better it was than I remembered. Greene's screenplay may seem a bit rambling for modern audiences, but I enjoy watching these deeper dives into the characters. It's funny, too--the scene where Cotten is hot-airing his way through the presentation for the Brits' literary club is wonderful! Of course, Welles performance is so good that he's a tangible presence, even when he's not there---which is for most of the film. His speech on the Ferris wheel contains one of the most simple, believable yet profound depictions of the banality of modern evil that's ever been. The twists, the cinematography, the quirky theme song---all come together to make a true classic."
silverscreen888,"May 1, 2006",7/10,"While I regard the ""Third Man"" as artistic, very strongly so, in the sense of being ""minimally graphically depicted, filled with memorable images and intelligently photographed,I disagree,for many reasons, with calling it more than very good. I review the film here because its artistic successes have been much imitated, as have elements of its storyline. The story of ""The Third Man"" can be stated simply. ""A writer of genre westerns travels to Vienna to find his boyhood friend Harry Lime, at Lime's request. He discovers the man has recently died, a fact attested by several of Lime's friends. The local occupation force's leader, whom he seeks out to ask about the death, warns him to stay away from the case, that Lime was a thoroughly bad sort. Deciding to investigate the death and perhaps clear his friend's name, or at least prove the authorities were wrong about Lime, the writer becomes involved with Lime's girl friend, finds rumors of Lime's death were exaggerated, then must face a final crisis--what to do about the man."" Acting in the film is decidedly uneven, I assert. As the writer, Joseph Cotten captures the man's psyche but he does not sound like a writer of westerns. As Lime, Orson Welles is understated, quirky, powerful at times and generally perhaps believable. Trevor Howard as the head of the authorities is not as strong as he soon will be in a series of 1950s triumphs, while Alida Valli as the girlfriend seems the best feature of the film, visually and professionally. Unfortunately, owing to the noir nature of the writer's central role--he cannot ask the police for help, since he is ignoring their assessment of Lime's bad character--and to his being a stranger in Vienna, the characters he meets remain intelligently defined but on the adventure level of types and acquaintances. Even Lime's friends cannot be individuated; so that the best scenes in the film, by my standards, occur when Cotten or Valli has something specific to do--she being questioned by police or he by literary overly-intellectual zealots, he chasing after her, or she telling him he does not understand his old friend. Lime ,at one point, revealing himself to the man he had sent for, defends his action in committing black market crimes; he famously likens the people (whose lives he is destroying) to ""ants"" he is stepping on, which is what people glimpsed from the top of a Ferris Wheel upon which he and the writer are riding look like from that remove.. The motive for Lime's needing to disappear after being found out as the perpetrator of a deadly dangerous fraud seems more real to the viewer, I claim, than does his idea that he might get away with such a crime for any length of time. This I found to be quite unconvincing. And it goes to the heart of three matters--why Lime sent for his old friend, what he thought he was doing and how convincing is the entire plot. But the shadow-haunted, textured B/W quality of the scenes filmed, the over-used but generally splendid Anton Karas' zither accompaniment and the artistry with which director Carol Reed has presented his story are the triumphs of the project. Credit for the artfulness belongs to cinematographer Robert Krasker, set decorator Darion Simoni, assistant director Guy Hamilton and others such as art director Joseph Bata, Ferdinand Bellan, Vincent Korda, John Haworth and James Sawyer."
bull-frog,"Apr 10, 2007",5/10,"This film doesn't quite cut it. I was shocked at the high reviews it was getting. I don't believe I have seen a more boring movie - I'm surprised I made it all the way through. The acting is fairly one-dimensional - particularly Anna. I had difficulty feeling moved by anybody. But I have to admit the last three minutes were well done - the only part that kept me awake.Third Man takes a tremendous amount of concentration in order to comprehend. For one, there is way too much dialogue. Much of the dialogue could have easily been substituted visually means and action. I found myself having to continuously rewind in order to pick up on something that I missed. In addition, the background music was annoying."
robinstafford-87434,"Dec 27, 2023",10/10,"Combine a great story and direction with brilliant acting, perfect music and you get a fantastic film. But the cinematography and atmosphere take it to a whole different level. Any number of shots from the film could be used in an exhibition of B&W photography. The final scene and long shot is just perfect. Has to be in any serious film buffs top 5.It helps if you have read some Graham Green as it is a reflection on good and evil with two people who love someone who has turned out to be deeply flawed. But whom they still care for in their different ways. Deeply sad and gets me every time. And Ive watched it dozens of times."
Joel I,"May 22, 1999",10/10,"This beautifully crafted, literate, and surprising masterpiece is my pick for greatest film of all time.  It would be in the top 10 in many different categories: direction, cinematography (some of the expressionistic compositions are breathtaking), editing, music (the solo zither was a masterstroke), best introduction of a character (Harry Lime), best climax (in the sewers), best closing shot (what a risk Reed took with that long take), best monologue (Welles on the ferris wheel).  All this is at the service of a fascinating story: a large cast of great characters (all the way down to the babbling old landlady in Anna's building), lots of twists, good irony, witty dialogue.  I don't agree with previous writers that the story is hard to follow.  I think it develops quickly, logically, and clearly.   Anna is a mysterious character, but she was meant to be that way. Joseph Cotton delivers a brilliant, underplayed performance that leads us into the story.  All elements comes together in this movie to make it the incomparable masterpiece that it is."
krorie,"Dec 11, 2005",10/10,"This film would be on my top ten list of the greatest movies I have ever seen. It established British director Carol Reed as a director of international repute. He already had a long string of excellent movies to his credit. ""Stars Look Down,"" ""Odd Man Out,"" and ""Fallen Idol"" are among the best British films of the 1940's. Unfortunately, though he made other good films after ""The Third Man,"" none matched the skill and daring innovations of his masterpiece. Based on a story by Graham Greene, Alexander Korda, Welles, and Reed with the screenplay by Greene, ""The Third Man"" gets its energy and style mainly from two sources, Carol Reed's masterful direction and Orson Welles' stunning portrayal of the central character Harry Lime. Unfortunately, the gifted actor Joseph Cotten must play second fiddle to Welles and is not allowed to shine the way he was in Hitchcock's ""Shadow of a Doubt."" Actually the second best performance in the film is by Alida Valli who plays the vivacious Anna who continues to love Lime even after discovering that he is a despicable character responsible for hundreds of deaths and abnormalities. She never sees beyond the good times she had with him. The cat is used not only to identify Lime but also to point out that the animal loved him and he loved the animal, whereas Holly Martins (Cotten) almost kicks a dog and is bitten by a parrot, indicating that Holly is not all good and Lime is not all bad. Also, note what Holly does to his erstwhile friend Lime at the end of the movie. Maybe Lime was good earlier but the war turned him into a murderous cynic. The famous meeting between Holly and Lime at the amusement park shows Lime to be a sociopath who loves no one but himself. He uses false analogies and fallacious reasoning to justify his nefarious activities. With the use of his eyes and facial expressions, Welles makes Lime into an incarnation of the devil himself. Yet during the chase in the sewer Welles facial expressions show a kinder, gentler side to the alleged monster. Many times international criminals such as drug dealers close their eyes to the end results of their heinous trade just as Lime does in an attempt to justify their vicious crimes. Sometimes the media makes heroes out of the likes of Harry Lime. When Harry Lime is trapped he tries to escape through a gutter. His fingers are shown feeling the freedom above that is not to be his, another indication that perhaps Lime was once a different person in character and morals but now he belongs to the sewers that flow into the blue Danube.One striking feature of ""The Third Man"" is the shadowy forlorn photography of the streets of post-war Vienna, now an occupied closed city. Robert Krasker's photography abetted by Carol Reed's direction reminds the viewer of the magnificent photography by Gregg Toland in John Ford's ""The Grapes of Wrath."" Toland under Ford's guiding hand shows dust blowing over the shadows of the Oklahoma dispossessed, no longer the men and women they once were. So in ""The Third Man"" leaves are falling from the trees and are shown blowing in the wind, a reminder that post-war Europe is in shambles and history has moved westward. The lives of the people who reside in Vienna are also like the leaves blowing in the desolate deserted streets of the city that was once the cultural center of the universe where artists such as Mozart performed masterpieces.Another striking feature of ""The Third Man"" is the unforgettable zither music played and written by Anton Karas. This haunting piece became a best selling record and would be recorded over and over for a decade. Even with the advent of rock 'n' roll and hip hop, ""The Third Man Theme"" has lost none of its relevancy. It fits in so well with the photography and story of ""The Third Man.""The final scene will remain in one's mind long after the projector stops running. It is not the ending most viewers would like but it is the only ending possible."
JamesHitchcock,"Aug 15, 2013",10/10,"Some purists would claim that film noir is a uniquely American genre, but there were a number of British and European examples. The great British director Carol Reed made three of these, although none are actually set in mainland Britain. ""The Third Man"" is set in Vienna, ""The Man Between"" in Berlin and ""Odd Man Out"" in Northern Ireland. Of the four main characters in ""The Third Man"" only one, Major Calloway, is actually British. In Graham Greene's original screenplay Harry Lime and Holly (named Rollo) Martins were also British, but their nationality was changed in order to provide roles for two big-name American stars.It is noteworthy that all of Reed's noirs contain the word ""man"" in the title, because film noir tended to be a male-dominated genre. The main theme of ""The Third Man"" is male friendships, in particular the friendship between Lime and Martins (a man, despite his feminine- sounding Christian name). Martins, an unsuccessful of  writer pulp Westerns, arrives in Vienna looking for his childhood friend Lime, who has offered him a job, only to learn that Lime has recently been killed in a traffic accident. His investigations, however, lead him to believe that there is something suspicious going on, that Lime's death may not have been an accident, and that his friend may have been involved in a corrupt black-market racket. (The title refers to a discrepancy in different accounts of Lime's death; were there three witnesses to the accident, or only two?)The film is noted for its atmospheric cinematography. Vienna is often portrayed in the British and American cinema as a city of music, gaiety and romance, but in 1949 it was no longer the city of the Hapsburgs and Johann Strauss. It was a city battered and impoverished by war and, like Berlin, divided into zones controlled by the four occupying powers, the sort of place where rackets like Lime's could easily flourish. The film captures this atmosphere of decadence, seediness and corruption perfectly. The look of the film, characterised by harsh lighting, expressionist black-and-white cinematography and oblique camera angles, is certainly influenced by American noir, but Reed showed that these techniques could also be applied to European subjects. One film that appears to have been an influence on him was ""The Lady from Shanghai"", directed by Orson Welles who of course appears here as an actor.There are four striking acting performances. One comes from Alida Valli (here billed simply by her surname) as Lime's actress girlfriend Anna Schmidt, who also befriends Martins. Despite her German-sounding name (possibly assumed), Anna is actually a Czech national living in Vienna on a forged passport and is wanted by the Soviet occupation authorities who are seeking to deport her to Czechoslovakia. Another comes from Trevor Howard as Calloway, a major in the British occupation forces. As an officer in the Royal Military Police he is responsible for investigating Lime's offences. Martins originally sees him simply as a pedantic bureaucrat with an obsession about enforcing the law to the letter, but as the film progresses we come to realise that he is in reality a deeply humane man who despises Lime because he can see the suffering that Lime's rackets are causing. The third comes from Joseph Cotten as Martins, a typically noir hero who despite a certain disregard for the law has his own sense of honour and decency, and finds himself torn between loyalty to his old friend and his growing sense of distaste for that friend's activities.The film's most memorable performance, however, comes from Welles as Lime himself. The two scenes everyone remembers him for are the one on the Wiener Riesenrad, or giant Ferris wheel, where he gives the famous ""cuckoo clock"" speech, and the final shootout in the sewers. (Since the film came out everyone has associated cuckoo clocks with Switzerland, but the Swiss would point out that they were actually invented in Germany). Lime is one of the great screen villains, a monster of cynical self-interest who has no regard for the sufferings of others, yet who in Welles's interpretation achieves a certain monstrous grandeur, becoming like Milton's Satan a figure of heroic evil. Welles has comparatively little screen time, yet whenever he is on screen he dominates proceedings completely.Discussion of this film would not be complete without mention of the musical score, written and performed by Anton Karas on the zither, which is particularly haunting and suited to the overall mood of the film. ""The Third Man"" is often considered one of the greatest films of all time, an opinion from which I would not dissent. It is probably the greatest of all British films noirs, its main challengers in that respect being Robert Hamer's ""The Long Memory"" and (if one regards it as noir) Roy Boulting's ""Brighton Rock"", also based on a story by Greene. It is one of those rare films where script, acting, direction, photography and music all combine to produce something of rare quality. 10/10"
lordrob,"Nov 7, 1999",7/10,"This is a very good film, but it could have been better. The plot, while clever, is rather predictable. (I figured out who the Third Man was as soon as the Romanian guy denied there was a third man). Also, while Welles' brief performance is probably the finest of his career, Cotten's acting is rather flat and uninspired, making his character more one-dimensional than is really necessary. The cinematography is inspired, truly some of the finest to be found anywhere, but the editing is rather choppy. The movie deserves to be on the AFI 100 list for its contribution to cinematic history, as it is really the forerunner of the entire film noir genre, but on its sheer artistic merits it does not quite rank with Fantasia, Network, The Manchurian Candidate, and a number of other films AFI placed farther down on the list. However, on the whole The Third Man is certainly worth seeing--Welles' entrance (however predictable) and the superb ferris wheel sequence can make the film worthwhile all by themselves."
epeck15,"Mar 30, 2006",10/10,"Like most people who post reviews on this site, I love movies. I'm not a professional reviewer, but I've seen lots of movies in my day. And from that vast list, most of which has long since faded into my mind's oblivion, a very few stand out. Casablanca. Chinatown. The Godfathers. Bridge On The River Kwai. Annie Hall. The Third Man stands in that company, and maybe at the front. This site contains so many excellent reviews of this movie and its cinematography, its music, its Graham Greene-inspired plot and dialogue. I won't try to re-do what so many reviews have already done. No, I'm writing this comment to honor Joseph Cotten. This movie will always be associated in the first instance with Orson Welles, who, as most readers will know by now, is on screen for but a few minutes. And while those minutes may represent the most memorable small role in the history of cinema, it's Joseph Cotten who carries this movie. His performance as the bumbling, naive, yet ultimately heroic Holly Martins, is perfect. It's an incredibly demanding role, because in order for the movie to work, we have to see Holly as childlike in his adoration of the evil Harry Lime (played by Welles), adolescent in his pursuit of Lime's bereaved girlfriend, slippery enough to have been Lime's one-time running mate, yet clever enough to unravel a mystery that's fooled the cynical British army cop, Major Calloway, played brilliantly by Trevor Howard. And all that and more, we have to like him. Cotten, who is in virtually every frame of the movie, pulls it off. Nowadays, little is written about Joseph Cotten. Maybe it was his man-on-the-street looks. More likely, he'll always be seen as a lesser satellite in Welles' galaxy. Pity, because he was great, and his performance as Holly Martins in The Third Man, is fantastic."

avik-basu1889,"Jan 26, 2015",5/10,"The Third Man is always regarded as on the greatest films to ever come out of the genre of noir. It is also regarded as one of the greatest British films of all time, but sadly I failed to find anything fascinating in this film.From a technical standpoint the film is well made. The outdoor locations of Vienna are picturesque and well shot and the cinematography is flawless. The use of lighting in the climax is also amazing. But that's about it as far as the positives go for me. The storyline is set at the backdrop of Vienna, a city tortured by the perils of the WWII and it also deals with the context of the inevitable rise of corruption in a broken economy and a suffering society where corrupt people employ devious means to earn big by making use of the common person's deficiencies and in doing so climb to the top of the food chain. But unfortunately the director didn't go deep into the aforementioned themes and the story itself felt so flat and none of the characters seemed interesting and deep. I sat through the the initial scenes with the hope that things will get better, but they never did. A noir film at the basic level has to keep you engrossed,but this film didn't keep me so and the big reveal wasn't shocking at all.Orson Welles is good in it, but the acting as a whole in the film is just acceptable with nothing in particular worth a special mention.So in a nutshell, The Third Man is a technically well made film with great cinematography, but every other aspect of the film is mediocre at best. Maybe it is the raised expectations due to its critical acclaim that let me down in the end."
kidboi,"Aug 22, 2006",10/10,"You could probably compare this film to ""Casablanca"". A lot of the themes are quite similar, such as love triangle, post-WWII setting etc. But in my opinion, this film is superior to ""Casablanca"". It doesn't take itself too seriously, has a slightly ironical fell to it and just feels right.What new can i say about this film, that hasn't been said before at least a hundred times? Probably nothing. So, i guess i'll just bring up everything we all know and love. I guess the first thing that really caught my attention was the dialog. It is amazingly written, easily quotable, mostly grabs your ears when it is being said by Orson Wells, hence the cuckoo clock talk. Another thing that is definitely worth mentioning would be the cinematography. It was pretty slick, very original for that time. It's kind of distorted, some lack of light on the actors faces. Well, and then there are other things that make this movie a classic - the acting, the zither music, the story itself, portrayal of the post - WWII Vienna.See this movie, if you still haven't. If possible, see it more than once. Much more.10/10"
slatefaced,"Feb 24, 2005",10/10,"In my top 3. This movie has some of the best shadow work I've ever seen. Deep Caravaggio lighting is striking. And the music is tops.On to story...They just don't write 'em like this anymore. This script has it all. The use of the camera is, too me, the most intelligent use of a camera in all of film history. The characters are all so round and bursting with fullness that it makes me want to puke...it's so perfect. How did they do it? It was just another movie that they were pumping out...They just happened to throw in a ferris wheel scene that has become one of the most classic scenes of all time.What a splendid job of recording history. The four sectors of Vienna. I don't think I'll live to see a film that has a better final scene. wow."
dmill4762,"Mar 24, 2000",10/10,"In my opinion, The third man is Welles' greatest work, surpassing even Citizen Kane. It is more subtle than Kane and brilliantly conveys a sense of the despair of post war Austria with the textural darkness of the settings. The undercurrents of the film tell us that all the players are corrupt in some way."
robert-temple-1,"Jun 16, 2008",10/10,"I have just seen this again for perhaps the fifth time. Over the years, one's perceptions of the film alter, one seems to grow with it, or it grows with you. This time I realized more forcibly than I had done before just how much Robert Krasker's spectacularly inspired and atmospheric cinematography made this film what it is. Krasker appropriately got an Oscar for it. He had previously done 'Brief Encounter' (1945), and later did 'Billy Budd' (1962) with Peter Ustinov directing, both highlights of his career also. Of course, this film was ultimately a triumph because of Carol Reed's superb direction. No matter that Joseph Cotten, Valli, and Orson Welles gave unforgettable performances which rank in the annals, those performances could easily have been swallowed up and lost in a bad film. To Reed goes the credit of this masterpiece. This time I noticed that he overdid the angular shots: there were just too many of them (unlike the sparing and more effective use of them by Stanley Kramer in 'On the Beach' for instance). I knew Carol well towards the end of his life. He lived at 123 Kings Road in Chelsea, where he had taken the ceiling out of his drawing room so that it was two stories high with a balcony. How well I remember the little loo at the back, with all the walls covered in framed cartoons, caricatures, and newspaper clippings about 'The Third Man'! One used his loo a lot, because of the great quantities of gin and tonic which were always on offer, and hence one was constantly re-entering the world of this film as one answered various calls of nature inspired by the gin. Carol was a very tall and imposing man, of infinitely gentle, kindly and generous nature, but in old age was greatly afflicted by a terrible deafness. I used to get so exhausted shouting at him at the top of my voice. It really does put a damper on conversational ease. He liked to reminisce about 'The Third Man'. He enjoyed a good triumph, and that was probably his greatest. What a sweet fellow, so deeply missed by all his friends, of whom I must have been the youngest. It is not so often realised how sentimental Carol was about children, especially little boys. This was proved by his astounding film 'The Fallen Idol'. But in 'The Third Man' he makes remarkable use of a fascinating little boy with huge eyes who chases Holly Martins down the street as the murderer of his father: this was a hallmark touch of Carol's, to use a child like that to create high drama. I often thought that Carol himself, though a giant, was really a 'little boy who never grew up'. Certainly he understood the world of innocence, which may be one reason why the worm of corruption in the soul of Harry Lime reeks with such overpowering stench in this film, as the antithesis of what Reed himself approved of. In this viewing, Valli appeared harder, more deeply in love with Lime that I had noticed before, more impervious to any other reality than that of his spell. Orson Welles's 'spell' seems to grow with each viewing of this film, as if each time one sees it, more phosphorescent light is emitted by that eerie face so suddenly illuminated in the doorway. And oh, the haunting atmosphere of that deserted postwar city at night! The alleys! And the subterranean river with its sewer drains, of which Carol included so many extra brooding shots, to such great effect. How many 78 rpm records of Anton Karas's theme song were sold? It must have been more than a million. This film has never ceased to live in our imaginations, nor should it."
briancham1994,"Jun 12, 2021",7/10,"This film is a masterpiece of cinematography. Channeling earlier noir works, it features stark black and white contrast in restricted spaces to give characters a mysterious and isolated feel. The scenes at night and in the sewer are especially notable for the way they frame characters as insignificant in their settings, a theme reflected by Vienna's amoral and cryptic nature. However, the plot and pacing leaves much to be desired, as the first half really is just the author bumbling around asking the same questions over and over again. Even by the end, nothing much has really happened or been revealed - a classic case of style over substance, but the style is worthy of praise in itself."
ppw3o6r,"Apr 25, 2006",10/10,"One of the greatest films ever made! Everything is perfect: the story, the setting, the direction, the acting, and the cinematography! It even has one of the greatest quotes ever written (it was supposedly written by Orson Welles himself): ""Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly."" With a quote like that how can it be bad?"

I have only just started to get into noirs and this has most certainly confirmed my love for them. I think this film was particularly unusual and innovative because of the constant use of slightly slanted camera angles  almost like a comic book. There were also lots of shots of a character talking to another character that has their back to the camera, this also made it very comic book like but added to the intensity which is needed in a film noir.And for those of you who like films that keep you on your toes, this is certainly one of them! There are a lot of plot turns and it keeps you guessing but it is still believable.Harry Martin is constantly torn and Cotton captures his nonchalant hero quality exceedingly well. Welles is also amazing as Harry, and Valli who plays Anna (Harry's lover) is also very dark, brooding but also warm. The acting is brilliant, no qualms there.I have heard people  in particular, my Mother  complain about the plot holes in this movie. I can understand what she is saying but these so-called plot holes can be easily 'filled up' with a bit of common sense (I suggest the IMDb boards).All in all, a purely magnificent film like so many other films of this genre. The story is witty, intelligent, dramatic but also slightly comedic at times, the acting realistic  great performances from all but what truly sets this film apart is the cinematic experience that you get when you watch it, as it is completely fresh and nothing like I've seen before. Ten out of ten for this superb thriller noir."
frytechnician,"Dec 25, 2007",10/10,"I like to consider myself as a somewhat cultured man in the world of cinema - I have engaged in many film delights for many different reasons; from the downright silly to the spiritually moving, non stop action to obscure art-house, gritty realism to total fantasy, sweeping epics to the blunt and insular.The Third Man is my personal favourite movie of all time for one overwhelming reason - it's wry charm - which this film has in spades.This is just a perfect film; every time I see those zither strings being plucked at the intro, I'm there in Vienna. The crooked camera angles of the streets, the brilliantly acted characters of Harry and Holly and their intertwining relationship, the dryness of Calloway, the absolute wit and grace of the script and of course, one of the most memorable scores in movie history all combine to create an incredible piece of film noir but with so much more humour, irony, tension and characterisation than others in its genre (not dismissing such other greats as Double Indemnity and Touch of Evil which are also superb).So at the risk of sounding like a rabid fan, yes, I do believe this to be the greatest film of all time - and the ferris wheel scene should be more than enough evidence to prove this!Perfect - 10/10"

ShootingStar82,"Sep 10, 2025",7/10,"One of the most striking things about the Third Man is how beautifully shot it is. Light and darkness are used in perfect harmony, creating a beautiful atmosphere, particularly during the nighttime scenes. Post war Vienna is also a stunning setting for this film.However, as good as some aspects of The Third Man are, other aspects of it are jarring. The jaunty, playful music present throughout large swathes of the film feels at odds with the action on the screen. The plot is also humdrum, with a distinct lack of depth and intrigue.What you're left with is a good, but not great film. If you're expecting a classic, you'll probably be a little disappointed, but the cinematography alone is enough to make me give this a warm recommendation."
Howlord,"Nov 16, 1998",10/10,"The Third Man is the most perfectly executed movie I have ever seen.  All the performances are perfect.  The camera work  is as innovative as Citizen Kane's.  The Screenplay by Graham Greene is the greatest ever to be used on screen (even though he didn't write Orson Welles speech about the Cuckoo Clock).  The film also has historical importance as a living reminder of the impact of World War II on Vienna and the world in general.  The messages of this film have haunted ever since I first saw it, and the suspense sequences are first rate.  Carol Reed should have gotten his best director Oscar for this and not Oliver.  Anyone who wants to see a truly great film should do whatever they can to get their hands on a copy of this masterwork."
DeanAmythe,"Dec 28, 2023",7/10,"Canted cameras galore and perhaps the best lighting cinema has ever been graced with. Every technique here seems to be in service of a filmic translation of the tumultuous state that post-WW2 Vienna underwent. This is sadly incorporated into the score, which ends up in laughable and even vexatious dissonance with the atmosphere, a brooding underworld accompanied by music that sounds not too dissimilar to Spongebob's theme. Despite my appreciation for this directorial aim, though, I found most of this slightly underwhelming in that department. Lots of quick cutting during regularly paced dialogue and no eagerness for blocking lengthier shots. Made me yearn for Welles in the director's seat, which is funny considering the film instantly gets better as soon as he shows up (his reveal is the best moment in it). Until that point, I found myself somewhat disinterested in the mystery plot that meanders a bit. Still, these are all blemishes on an otherwise gleaming surface that I hope to appreciate more when I take another (and closer) look at it."
etro,"Oct 15, 2006",4/10,"Very disappointing. This film is highly over-rated. The story is set in the war-torn Austrian city of Vienna, just after the Second World War, and is told from the point of view of an American pulp western author, Holly Martins, who is searching for a college friend, Harry Lime, who had offered him the opportunity to work with him in Vienna.At the beginning of the film, Martins discovers that his old friend Harry Lime, whom he had not seen since before the war, has been killed in an accident under mysterious circumstances just prior to Martins' arrival in Vienna. The deeper he delves into Harry's death, the more Martins finds that there was more to Lime than he knew and that Harry has been accused of being a black market racketeer, trafficking in adulterated penicillin.The only interesting angle to the film is the way in which Martins sort of becomes the heroic advocate of justice that he writes about- only this time the setting is post-war Vienna (which is fairly wild and untamed) not the wild west- a rather intriguing parallel, but not enough to save the film, which suffers from a generally lack-luster plot."
klaw-2,"Mar 1, 1999",10/10,"When I think of this movie, I can't help but compare it to Casablanca...this is almost the anti-Casablanca.  Everything is contrapuntal and played against one another, but with such playfulness that the music hits so perfectly.  The great man of the movie, Lime, is nothing but a scoundrel, and the anti-hero Martin is a complete sap, the love interest Anna oblivious and self-absorbed.  Truly a remarkable story, played with great heart and really probably the darkest humor you will find in a movie.  Orson's blitz of a rationalization for his insensitive evil is one of the funniest and well written speeches you will ever hear."
Lamanai,"Oct 10, 1998",10/10,"The Third Man is classic film noir.  Combining the genius of Welles and Greene, the film tells the story of Holly Martins (Cotten), a writer of pulp western arriving in post-war Vienna, discovering that his school-boy friend Harry Lime (Welles), has met his end.  Martins' curiosity into the events surrounding Lime's death are well founded as he seeks to find the truth surrounding Lime's death.  What he finds about his friend Lime is the catch. Classic Welles, classic Greene...don't miss this film."
u_torre,"Oct 19, 2006",10/10,"Brilliant performances from Howard, Cotten, Valli, and of course Welles even though his camera time was limited. Orson Welles speech on the ferris wheel to Cotten is truly memorable as he shifts from warm and affectionate, to a very cold and chilling character.Orson Welles cohorts in his crimes are perfect character actors in their roles as impoverished Austrians scratching out a living in post war Europe.Camera work is true film noir, and the music from Anton Karas is pure magic.I have watched this film over and over for 40 years and always enjoy it."
dataconflossmoor,"Mar 13, 2008",10/10,"This film has been noted as one of the best films ever in the history of the American cinema!!! While this website ranks it 48th best movie out of the top 250, and AFI (American Film Institue) has ranked it as high as the 14th best picture out of the top 100 American films ever made, something even more significant looms on the horizon!! Many intellectual spawns of the American film academy have ranked this film in the top five films ever produced!! One prominent critic from Boston ranked ""Third Man"" the number one movie of all time!! So!!! What justifies such critically acclaimed praise anyway? Start with the fact that the intellectual complexities to the plot in ""Third Man"" are intensely riveting!! The esoteric demeanor with which this film carries, has a deliberately convoluted line of logic!! The derivative responses from so many of the characters in this film spark a necessary ambiguity with regards to the prevailing circumstances for whom the third man must relinquish his mystique to!! The conversations pertinent to any kind of plausible resolution to the core issues in this movie were always philosophical!! Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles are a highly classic and highly talented duo of actors (As demonstrated in ""Citizen Kane"") who immediately necessitate a lofty aura of academic concepts. This detailed and contemplative cerebral quandary invites the movie audience to a very noteworthy ideological rumination of the story line in this film. Whether it be ""Citizen Kane"", ""The Third Man"", or any other film, the indisputable mark of the majority of intelligent actors ( Including Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten) is one where they convey the understanding of a situation, and instantly establish whether this situation is really complicated or very simple!! This is about the seventh time I have seen this movie ""The Third Man"" and, I believe, that finally!! I have a grass roots recognition of what this movie is about!! The visceral components to this film induce a correlation to an adamant political passion, as well as, yes, what else? love!! The trials and tribulations of espionage became a form of mutual vindication, thus establishing a kindred spirit for emotional devotion!! Set in Vienna, this film was very identifiable to me, as I have been to Vienna, and I recognize a lot of aspects of splendor to this city. All of it ignited an auspicious recognition; the Gosser Beer signs, the Sacher Cafe', the Mozart concertos with the players wearing wigs, ( I saw a production of this nature while in Vienna!!), and, of course, the cobblestone streets where a cross section of dubious walks of life perennially congregate!! Vienna is a city which is proverbially known to be a hotbed of political malcontents!! Just by virtue of the copious number of summits and dignitary gatherings it has hosted suggests that Vienna is a city which vicariously straddles the political fence!! With the intransigent aftermath of WWII, and the world almost ready to go to war again over the conquest of Berlin in 1948, central Europe had become totally dissected!! By 1949, when ""The Third Man"" was made, the overall infrastructure, which was ruined in Vienna, from confrontational combat during WWII, was ubiquitous!! The city was divided in four sections, belonging to four nations, the American, the British, the Russian, and the French. The center of the city was international, and for Joseph Cotten's character, Vienna presented itself as a mecca for diplomatic intrigue!! I loved this movie!! Based on the screenplay by Graham Greene, this film erupts with talent. Carol Reed ( Known for ""Oliver"" and a remake of ""Mutiny on the Bounty"") does a remarkable job as director with his efforts in the making of ""The Third Man""!! The acting in ""The Third Man"" was utterly superb, basically second to none !! Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten are an unbeatable combination, and Alida Valli, who plays Anna, is flawlessly disconcerting with this role!! The speech Orson Welles made was one which he wrote... the gist of it being (I am paraphrasing)"" War, terror and bloodshed are adversities which brought on greats such as Michaelangelo, Leonardo DaVinci, and the Renaissance, Switzerland has had 500 years of peace and democracy, and all you have gotten out of them is the cuckoo clock"". I thought this little doggerel of Welles' was very impressive!! Orson Welles is a lone rebel cynic who raised the bar on directing and acting excellence, not only in Hollywood, but also, in New York and London Theatre!! Orson Welles has the same birthday as I do, I guess this day was earmarked for brilliant byproducts of unprecedented genius!! (My personal vanity in this case is totally in kidding of course!!) The Hawaiin music in this film served as an aside for anachronistic flippancy with this picture!! The cinematography and lighting in this film were spectacular!! Accomplished actors, directors and producers prefer a movie to be filmed in black and white, as it exudes the absence of distraction!! The film ""Third Man"" is a must see for virtually every movie aficionado on the face of the earth!! I agree with the discerning movie critics, THIS IS ONE OF THE BEST MOVIES EVER MADE!!"
OzuKurosawa007,"May 19, 2004",N/A,"There are so many things that one can say about a movie this good. The acting is great. It's fun to watch again and again. There's great composition in every shot. It's a great story with great characters. I'm really partial to the Joseph Cotton performance as Holly Martens. The character is set up for adventure from the start. The inviting voice-over describes Vienna during the ""classic period of the black market"" and proceeds to introduce us to Holly Martens. He arrives in Vienna with a certain sense of starry-eyed excitement to see and work with his friend.For me, this set a very inviting tone for the rest of the film. This is appropriate because, in a sense, we look forward to meeting Harry Lime just as much as he does. Soon, we learn of Harry's death and are on our way to the funeral. Here, we catch the first glimpse of the mysteriously beautiful Anna (Alida Valli) as well as Major Calloway (Trevor Howard).Throughout the rest of the film, we'll meet new characters and learn so many new things about the recently deceased (or so we think), Harry Lime. The final character we meet is the one we feel we've known all along. Harry Lime (Orson Welles) makes his dramatic entrance on a dark street when the light from a disturbed tenant in a second story apartment comes on. It is my opinion that the only entrance that comes close to the drama of this scene does so, but with thrill factor. That's the first time we see the shark in Jaws. Call me crazy, but that's what I think.To reveal any more about this film, in my mind, would defeat the purpose of telling someone to watch it. There are many key elements that make it a great film that I want people to experience for the first time as I did. But it's a great story of friendship, love, greed, trust, and murder. Sir Carol Reed directed many a fine film. I thoroughly enjoyed Odd Man Out, Fallen Idol, and Trapeze. His musical, Oliver!, is something that belongs up there with West Side Story, Singin' In The Rain, and even The Sound Of Music."

This time Carol Reed takes the directing chair and not Orson Welles but I got to be honest here I actually thought that Orson Welles directed this movie just by the way it was shot and acted it looked like his kind of film, because while watching the movie I didn't do any research on the film so I just watch the movie without nothing about the film and while watching the movie I was wounding if Orson Welles directed it's not until the end credits when I find out that Carol Reed directed it. Orson Welles and Carol Reed are both genius when it comes to movies and The Third Man isn't anything different as this is one of the best movies ever made.Carol Reed directing in this movie is absolutely magnificent and pure cinema gold. At times I felt like I was watching a Orson Welles movie just by the way it was shot and how it was acted and how it was executed made it feel like another great movies all together in one. Carol Reed was a fantastic director for this movie as he made a brilliant mystery thriller like The Third Man. Nice work Carol Reed.The movie has this gloomy but yet a wide cinematic feeling to it that made this movie truly special then it is. With every shot in this movie that's both stunning and dazzling to my eyes. The famous scene in the sewers with that ionic image of Orson Welles is cinematography at it's best. Excellent work Robert Krasker the Cinematography of the movie.Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles both did a outstanding performance in this movie and so did everyone else in the film. Everyone in the movie delivered so much to they characters and to be honest I didn't find anyone else in the movie that did a terrible job. You can tell while watching the movie that these actors put a lot into they characters and it paid off brilliantly.Now for the problems that I had with this movie: I honestly didn't find a single thing that was a problem to me or even a flaw in this movie. You could say that it might be perfect, do I think it's perfect? well yeah, I do.Overall The Third Man is a movie that's absolutely worth checking out. These some other things in the movie that I could have brought up but to be honest and I do bring this up a lot and for good reasons. I want you the viewer to watch this movie like I did by not knowing much about the movie but only knowing the praise the movie got, I'm telling you to do this so you can experience what I experience.

hollis56,"Oct 31, 1999",7/10,"This was a film I saw many years ago, and without a vivid memory of the film in its entirety, I felt another viewing was in order before I wrote any comments. It was probably over 25 years since I had seen The Third Man, which would mean I was under 18, and at that age, I was really more interested in films that provided surface entertainment, rather than social commentary or a visual impact.With that in mind, I wanted to absorb everything this film was reputed to contain. What I found was a film with tremendous cinematography, several extremely powerful images, and a few memorable exchanges of dialog. However, it was not able to create an overall mood of other films typical of the genre. This may be due to my dislike of the score, which interrupted the growth of tension or intrigue, rather than enhancing it. Overall, the acting was pedestrian.As a mild excuse, the copy of the film was poor, and the sound quality substandard. I would like to see this film again, in a theater if possible, but certainly, a better print couldn't hurt."
denizov,"Mar 13, 2018",4/10,"I expected much more from this film, as usually they claim it to be a classic movie, one of the best in history of cinema etc. But in my opinion it isn't. It has too many shortcomings. First of all -- the music is totally inappropriate for such a thriller, it is mocking and amusing, which does not fit with the whole story at all. It makes it all look like a light-hearted comedy, not to be taken seriously. The dialogues are presented in a mechanical, artificial way: normal people do not respond so quickly to surprising and unknown information. The plot fixes too much attention to the girl, rather than to the complex and confused story. The good things are the cinematography and the atmosphere of postwar Vienna, where the action takes place, but even they should have been given more attention."

The strong storyline backed by believable characters, shot in black and white in a bombed Vienna mostly at night where stark lighting created deep shadow's created for me one of the most atmospheric film's I have ever seen. Behind all of this and adding to the atmosphere was the haunting theme tune 'The Harry Lime Theme' played on zither by Anton Karas. I was continually whistling this tune as a child. so much so that my parents took me to our local theatre when Anton Karas appeared there in 1950.Probably the best film ever made and no computer gimmick's!"
meet_the_feebles,"Dec 18, 2002",10/10,"﻿The Third Man is one of the best movies of all time. It's a far cry from any other Noir film, ever. Alfred Hitchcock on his best day (North By Northwest) didn't even come within a million leagues of The Third Man. I read a review that had the nerve to compare The Third Man to The Usual Suspects! This would be a grand example of what movies today are doing to people.The reviewer who stated this said that they lost interest in The Third Man about half way through? What? Here is a film that puts it's audience in a trance the second Joseph Cotten enters the screen. In fact it's ONLY flaw was the seemingly pointless narration at the very start. The rest of the movie is perfect.The Third Man was perfectly shot, edited, directed, acted and told. The music stays familiar from the opening credits until the end. The score helps keep the movie from confusing itself, the score shows us that this movie had it's own personality and own flawless flaws. It lives and dies as it is. It doesn't try to put in songs of it's past, (the songs from the Billboard's Top Ten) that may make a feeling of nostalgia and confuse the viewer into believing they're watching a great movie, but are indeed being tricked with clever magic of the emotions. (i.e. Casino and the worst yet Forrest Gump). These movies aren't sure what they are, other than they are.Not mention, here is a movie that holds a climax of words and still finds the time to put one of the best chase scenes (if I can lower the standards of the film to say CHASE SCENE) at the end. A double climax? Yes, one for the high brows another for people who think Usual Suspects is a movie to compare other movies with. (If your wondering, I believe the ""Coo-coo Clock Speech"" is a definite climax).The Third Man is magic. Magic! MAGIC! There will never, in a million years be a better Noir movie than this.**** (out of ****)"
Elizabeth-328,"Aug 16, 1999",10/10,"This movie is incredible!  Orson Welles and Joseph Cotten once again create magic together on screen.  And this is one of the greatest suspense dramas! Even though Orson plays a really despicable person, I love him anyway.  He's so carefree...he fakes his own death without thinking about the consequences.This really is a true film-noir movie.  And the dynamic duo Cotten and Welles really are great together.  ""The Third Man"" is a must-see!Rating: 10/10"
crowdkiller,"Dec 16, 2003",10/10,"This film is perfect.I've just finished watching it and I was blown away. The direction is stunning with a war torn Vienna providing plenty of beautiful shots. The acting is stellar, Cotton is amazing and Welles further shows his genius here the cuckoo clock speech being but one high point. But the story itself is what makes this film so good i will not go in to any detail so please watch it. I highly recommend this film to all film fans.I'd go as far as to say after one viewing its in my top ten favourite films its really that good. Peace."
aeaston,"May 19, 2004",N/A,"Seeing it again recently on a crisp DVD made me realize just what a beautifully crafted film this was. I can say that the final cemetery scenes stick in my mind as the most beautiful and effective rejection I have ever witnessed. A timeless classic of which I could never tire. How Orson Welles could so completely dominate a movie in which he occupied the screen for so few minutes, the superb sequencing on the giant ferris wheel, the haunting theme played on a zither and co-ordinated so beautifully with scenes of danger and tenderness, all combine in what I feel was Carol Reed's finest effort. If I was stuck in solitary for a decade and had a couple of movies like this to pass the time I would come out a better person."
docp,"Oct 9, 2000",10/10,"It has the most wonderful photography, the most haunting music, tremendous atmosphere, riveting personalities, historical interest - just simply, everything.  No more need be said except that if you haven't yet seen it, then fall in love with it as soon as possible; you are missing pure magic."
euplay1220,"Aug 14, 2019",6/10,"Classic movies often take me by surprise because they have so much substance, so much more to show than many of the recent Hollywood eye-candies do. Older movies like Metropolis (1927), Modern Times (1936), and To Be or Not to Be (1942), to name but a few, are all very engaging throughout their runtime.Unfortunately, The Third Man is a disappointing ""too little, too late"" movie. The movie should be cut down to 1 hour because it doesn't really get started until the last 30 minutes. The first 1 hour is a long, melodramatic nothingness. Storytelling is clumsy. Scene transitions are awkward. True, the background and characters need to be developed before Lime shows up; but the job can be done in 20 minutes, 30 at most. The movie gets more dull than suspenseful if it takes too much time showing too little. The music doesn't help, either.In my opinion, this movie doesn't stand the test of time as other classics do. It may have been ahead of its time when it came out, alright. Is it worth watching now? Not really."
alice liddell,"Jul 26, 1999",10/10,"The life of the avid film-goer can actually be a depressing, disillusioning thing.  After the initial gleeful devouring of the canon (about 300 movies), and the joyous stumbling over the odd undiscovered gem, the cineaste must be content with an endless trail of largely diminishing returns.  The only counter against this is brilliant films which never disappoint on the 18th viewing, such as Vertigo, The Wizard Of Oz, The Wild Bunch... ...and The Third Man, a film containing such multitudes that it makes you forget that the majority of British cinema is parochial, unambitious, self-satisfied rubbish.  A great film is by definition a labyrinth: whatever your mood, be it emotional or intellectual, you pick up a new thread of interpretation, and find yourself in places you've never been before, yet by the end, everything still doesn't quite fit, and you have to begin again. And you know that there is nothing in the world you want to do more.This time around, I noted the theme of authority and authoriality. Authors write books, and have total control over their characters and narrative. Authorities (less obviously) have the same power over the people they govern.  These two concepts make up the film's two quests, which in reality is only one.  Our hero, Holly Martins, is a novelist, who continually claims that he will write the story he is actually participating in.  Calloway is the authority (as morally detached as any modern writer) with the similar quest to find Harry Lime.  And yet it is Harry who is the real author of the plot: everything happens to his plan, his power is otherworldly - he is truly godlike, without body (being dead).  When we finally do see him, he is lit like a devil, or surveying Vienna like a deity.  The opening credits show us a zither playing a tune, but we don't see who's playing it.  And who is the jovial black marketeer, who narrates the opening montage, and then vanishes from the film?  When Harry dies, the story ends, reaches the deadlock of the astonishingly, bravely bleak closing scene.The Third Man is that rare film - perfect in every way, a popular narrative entertainment capable of holding great moral, artistic, philosophical, but most importantly, emotional weight.  Joseph Cotten gives the greatest male lead performance in all cinema, yet it is Orson Welles, as the story's author, whose boyish charm, and weary, nihilistic evil must drive the film, even in his absence.The movie is incredibly bleak - about people, about art, but it doesn't seem that way.  The whole thing plays like a Nabokovian black comedy (Harry Lime IS Humbert Humbert) - genuine terror frequently slips into farce, and vice versa.  The smooth, coherent narrative is always disrupted by non-sequiters and wild goose chases.  Karas' score prefigures those of Morricone's spaghetti westerns, in his use of music not as a subliminal dramatic accompaniment, but as an ironic Brechtian commentator on the action, yet also sympathetic and yearning.  Vienna is filmed as a sunken ship.  Like Lolita, the film is obsessed by doubles (Holly and Harry, Holly and Calloway etc.), but, also like Lolita, this doubling is parodied, and there is no hope in resolution.  The closure of the 'male' detective story is confounded by the hero's lack of progress in the romantic plot. Despite the film's cynicism, I was in tears when it ended, my ethics torn to shreds.  I love The Third Man, and have so much to say about it (I love the demonisation of children - South Park is spiritually indebted to Greene)I could write a book.  Do yourself one favour in your life and watch it; you'll never have to fall in love again.  Incidentally, is Harry gay?"

Fritz Lang`s  alter  ego,"Jan 15, 2000",10/10,"The  best  film  noir  ever  made. Mr  Welles  never  was  so  handsome, and so  evil  as  in  this  movie. But  Why he  must  die??????? Oh, that  horrible  censorship!!!!!! But, about  mr  Cotten, I  think  he  is  a  wonderful, but  too forgotten actor. Mr  Cotten^s  fan  club  now!"
Yuri-8,"Jan 12, 1999",10/10,"With Graham Greene you usually cannot go wrong. I have read the book, and (even though I love Greene as a writer) I was not that impressed. The movie is a different story however!The haunting image of post-war Vienna, occupied by all the different Allied powers, is beautifully recreated. Orson Welles is amazingly the star of the movie, even though he is hardly ever seen--his off-screen presence as mysterious Harry Lime is that great. The plot has twists and turns, and the public is generally kept in the dark. I do not know who Anton Karas was, but he created one of the best music scores to any movie I have ever seen--and what instrument is he using anyway?Watch that movie, enjoy it, and read more books by Graham Greene ... Like ""The Quiet American."""
charley-8,"Jan 2, 2004",10/10,My wife and I watched the DVD of _The Third Man_ last night.  I hadn't seen it in @25 years and had forgotten its greatness.  Rarely do you find a film in which you wouldn't want to change a thing.  This is such a film.  I wracking my brain to think of a film that uses black and white as dramatically -- maybe _The Night of the Hunter_
LISA-HANDLEY,"Sep 15, 2003",10/10,"One of the top 100 films of all time. This film tells the story of an American writer's journey to a post-war Vienna in search of a friend he thought he knew. Ultimately he learns his beloved friend is very different from the one he had once known and loved. He is destroyed by this discovery and the choice he must make. The acting is superlative, the cinematography, haunting & the story tells a truth for all time. See it."
KyleMorganAuthor,"May 20, 2019",6/10,"Between the loud zither music and the comic book angles on almost every shot, the movie begins to dip in quality. While the plot is decent, and most of the acting is good, there is only one big twist and you see it coming a mile away. Having said that, Orson Welles gives a masterful performance and if you can stick around till he appears, it's worth it."

cbriggs90,"May 12, 2004",10/10,"Beautiful black & white photography,that captures the post war desolation of Vienna, representing a 1000 other cities across Europe.Great script by Graham Greene but the famous line about Swiss cuckoo clock is now attributed to Orson Welles. Great performance by Orson Welles Should have won best picture Oscar and screenplay. The best ending in cinema history. This type of film confirms that at its best Cinema is art. Now running out of things to say. Thats it - finished!"
Bacardi1,"Oct 1, 2006",7/10,"While this remains one of my favorite films, the choice of the actress ""Valli"" remains a major disappointment to me.She lacks any sort of expression throughout the entire film except for maybe, what, two scenes? Other than that, she holds the same expressionless sad puss throughout the entire picture. Good grief - couldn't they have found someone who could actually act?? They could have pulled someone off the street to ""act"" her part better.And apparently she really thought a lot of herself, based on her insistence that she be credited by one name only ""Valli"". How utterly precocious & vain, especially considering her complete lack of talent. Exactly who did she think she was - the next ""Garbo"", as she was supposedly promoted when this picture came out? This picture, while terrific, could have been so much more with a better actress - or actually, ANY actress - in the female lead."
IDs_Ego,"May 30, 2005",2/10,"It's a noir classic, yes, but could anyone HEAR it? The audio is AWFUL! AWFUL! Again, the DIALOUGE IS BARELY HEARABLE. Maybe they cleaned it up for DVD, I don't know, I saw it on VHS. If you're in non-English country and saw it subtitled, you are far better off. It seems the Brits really didn't know how to do audio back then.I am not a ""real"" film buff, I just know what I like, and this was a disappointment since I did have high expectations. And while this film was set in Vienna, the music soundtrack has flavors of traditional Greek music. It's fine music, but a noir film set in Vienna doesn't play well with that. AT ALL. And unfortunately, it seriously detracted from my immersion into the film. Instead, it kind of killed the feel of the film for me. But I could barely hear what anyone was saying, anyway, so there you go.This film doesn't deserve to kicking around the top of any ""great"" movie list. There are a lot of good noir films that easily deserve to be placed far above this one. Yet, this is the one considered the classic."
Speedy-25,"Mar 31, 1999",10/10,"How many people had heard of a Zither before this movie? At a restaurant in Chicago named the Golden Ox (now gone) the entertainment was a Zither player with many years of experience on the instrument. When he was interviewed by a local newspaper about his experiences at the restaurant, he estimated that from the requests he got to play something for patrons, that no one in Chicago knew a second song for the instrument after the theme from The Third Man!In combination with the unusual and expressive music of this film, the brutally surprising camera work was masterful, switching from scene to scene and face to face rapidly to strengthen a feeling of danger, urgency, or fear.The film shows a harsh existence for Berliners in a recovering period after the close of World War Two. The darkly lit scenes added even more drama.The cast was first rate as was the story. A superbly created masterpiece."
Jake-5,"Nov 28, 2001",10/10,"I was lucky enough to have picked it out in a video store years ago knowing nothing about it (I was going through a Welles phrase at the time). The film blew me away, and the recent restoration of the British version (not the David O. Selnick-cut American version) is better still. I just finished reading a fantastic book on the making of the film called ""In Search of the Third Man"" by Charles Drazin, and the collaborative story behind the film is just as fascinating.In short, this is a film for *adult* tastes, and especially for people who like morals that are gray, rather than black and white. A beautiful, perfect film."
whpratt1,"Jan 27, 2004",10/10,"Alexander Korda, David O. Selznick were uncredited for their great talents as producer in this film and Orson Wells was also uncredited for his role as writer to this fantastic picture.

lizzie-25,"Aug 12, 1999",N/A,"I first saw it about 20 years ago. It has lived in my memory ever since for the power of its evocation of a battle-scarred, shadowy and frightening city whose decadence is expressed in the baroque magnificence of the stove in Anna's flat and in the incongruous polished pedestal of the column to the left in Calloway's office. A place where nothing and no-one can be trusted. A place of echoing and empty streets among ruins whose doorways and passages conceal incomprehensible menace.A recent second viewing confirmed, reinforced and enhanced my admiration. From the first strum of the zither to the final shot of Anna walking past Martins as she leaves the cemetery, the film exercises a total grip on the senses. The plot was as I remembered it, the detail this time threw up the themes of names/identity - Dr Winkel/Vinkel, Holly/Harry, Calloway/Callaghan - the theme of laughter: Anna's role as an actress in the play (""They only do comedy""), Harry's telling her she laughed too much, Holly's delight at her rare smile - and, above all, the pervasive air of pure and inescapable sadness, a quality rarely captured on film.I had forgotten how the appearance of the horrible child round the doorway in pursuit of his ball prefigures the first appearance of Harry Lime, preceded by the cat. Two apparently round, innocent faces - one presaging betrayal and the other evil. Death and destruction affecting thousands - the outcome both of war and of the criminal activities which follow in its wake - form the nervous backdrop, visual and narrative, to the film: yet there is only one on-screen killing. The tension of the scene in the sewers, the echoes, the shadows and the agonising confrontation of Harry and Holly provide the finest climax of any thriller I have seen. The credit has to be shared equally among Carol Reed, Robert Krasker and Graham Greene."
bit-5,"May 10, 2000",7/10,"I don't know just what all the people sees in this movie. Personally, I liked Graham Greene's book very much, but when I saw this film I felt it was not at the level of the original story. Right from the start (we got a Rollo Martins who suddenly becomes Holly Martins, and so on), the characters, circumnstances, and general atmosphere are very different in the two versions. I would not ask for an exact copy, of course; adaptation for the big screen is not that. But I would have been pleased to see a GOOD adaptation. And personally, when I saw this one I felt the magic was gone."
PimpinAinttEasy,"Sep 18, 2015",6/10,"The Third Man is a film where the background score is given a lot (maybe too much) of space. It is a nice score. But it is played all the time. Even during the melancholic scenes. I guess it is used to emphasize the fact that the film is tragicomic.Some of the camera angles and imagery (especially the scene on the staircase, the scenes inside the Ferris wheel, the man with the balloons towards the end and the action scenes inside the underground sewer) are amazing.The film is quite critical of American enterprise. The Orson Welles character could be symbolic of American capitalism and attitude towards life. His attitude is characterized by this line:""Don't be so gloomy. After all it's not that awful. Like the fella says, in Italy for 30 years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, and bloodshed, but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci, and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love - they had 500 years of democracy and peace, and what did that produce? The cuckoo clock. So long Holly.""Joseph Cotton is a writer of pulpy American westerns. I wonder if he is supposed to represent impending American cultural hegemony after World War 2. The film was released in 1949, so if this is what the director intended, then it is very prophetic.The female character played by Alida Valli, who covets Orson Welles despite all his flaws is not portrayed in very good light. Women prefer the bad boys.Some of the characters (like the book enthusiast who invites Cotton to a book discussion) were inserted just to make the plot more complicated. That whole scene was quite unnecessary. The film gets really good towards the end. It has a very cynical tone throughout - emphasized by the music and the desolate visuals of Vienna, ruined and devastated by the war. The child spy was quite sinister.It is a reasonably enjoyable film. I guess it is a classic if you consider the cinematography and the year it was made in. But I was not enamored by it."
kuntry_maus,"Apr 22, 2002",10/10,"Not one to dish out 10 out of 10 easily (check my other verdicts!), I must defer one to this film.It has been years since I saw it, but it is one of half a dozen films I'm still hassling the DVD shop if it will be available on one.All the elements of a great film are there, ruined if it had been shot in colour, ruined if the tune had been played on a piano, ruined if the echoes had been on modern Hi-fi, ruined if it had been any other way."
refresh_daemon,"Nov 1, 2006",7/10,"Some of the mystery in this mystery film is very quickly spoiled early on with the application of simple logic. But aside from that I have further complaints about this classic. On the other hand, I can't say I didn't enjoy it either.What the story has going for it are some fairly interesting characters, some acted very well, and a nice mystery plot. More interesting are the relationships between some of the primary characters and the expected turn-about in character direction. I like that few of the characters are what we initially think they are and how their relationship to each other changes. There are also just a few really well done scenes that are still pretty memorable.One of the problems with this film is that it's not much of a mystery. It's not hard to figure out what's going on from the start, which sort of neutralizes a little of the suspense. Another issue is that it's not consistent. There are a number of really good scenes and there are a number of mediocre scenes. That's not to say it isn't interesting, and unless you're really focusing on the direction, you might not see it--I didn't until I was looking at it a second time.But those issues aren't too big. I suppose my biggest issue is that it feels like a popcorn movie. It doesn't have a potent ""so what"". You saw glimpses of important decisions that might have been made, but the story is so railroaded that you never really get a sense of you wanting the characters make decisions, but rather, just follow along. It's an enjoyable popcorn movie, mind you, but you never have to get invested in it.And so, I guess it was a letdown for me. The movie has a lot of esteem as a classic and such, and I think that led me to believe that it would be a particularly impressive movie. Rather, it just ends up being an enjoyable but rather simple mystery tale. I guess I prefer my movies a little less obvious. The zither music is a neat diversion though. 7/10."
skyguywv,"Jun 29, 2014",4/10,"I thought I had seen all of the famous old films in my lifetime, but somehow I missed The Third Man. Today I watched it, with complete disgust due to that horrible (and stupid) Spanish guitar throughout the film. The music, if you can call it that was horrible. The guitar sounded out of tune half the time and it never went with the scene that it was supposed to enhance. Sometimes, the guitar player sounded like he was free forming the music and often lost his way. Yes, I know a very famous song came from this soundtrack but even THAT didn't go along with any scene or the plot in general. The entire soundtrack should have been in an Italian Comedy film where some stud is trying to impress a beautiful woman on the beach."
raif,"Feb 19, 2002",10/10,When the Criterion DVD came out I bought this movie.  I think I remember seeing bits and pieces of it many years ago when I was a little kid.  I watched the original trailer for this movie.  At first I was a little worried.  Anton Karas' rough sounding zither was not what I imagined a movie like the Third Man would have for its theme.  It is funny how trailers have evolved just over the past 20 years.  I had calmed myself down and prepared to watch this film with an open mind.  I had read so many reviews of this movie and heard the praises.  So many said that even though it was made in the late 40's it had a look and feel of a film of the late 50's to early 60's.  They were right.  This movie kept my attention and played with my imagination all the way to the end.  It is also funny to look at the scene when Harry Lime is revealed for the first time and to remember standing in that same spot in Vienna at 16 so many years ago and not know why your crazy German Teacher is going nuts and taking pictures.  Also at the end I had realized that my initial judgement of Karas' zither was incorrect.  It helped define the movie and especially Orson Welles' Harry Lime.  This movie is film-noir at its best.
bat-5,"Feb 10, 2000",10/10,"As you watch The Third Man, you are slowly sucked into the word of past war Austria.  You can almost taste the wet stones that line the streets and you feel just as alone as Holly Martins does.  Holly has come to Austria at the request of his boyhood friend, Harry Lime.  Upon arriving in Austria, Holly learns that Harry has been killed.  As Holly digs deeper into Harry's life in Austria, things start to get weird.  Turns out Harry wasn't all that Holly thought he was. That only drives Holly to find out what really happened to Harry, and who the mysterious Third Man is.   The Third Man not only showcases great performances from Joseph Cotton and Orson Welles, but it also boasts great black and white cinematography.  Shadows abound from every corner and the angles give you a feeling of being off balance, which is how Joseph Cotton feels through the first half of the film.  Post war Austria lends itself well to the story.  The bombed out buildings and dark streets highten the mystery and danger that lurk in the corners.  A great film that can never be topped, and once you've finished the film, you'll be in a dither over the zither."
elvircorhodzic,"Aug 28, 2016",10/10,"Vienna once, a romantic thriller story and hunt for the dead man. A rough picture of what represents this great movie. The third man is the film which is set located in the city who did not recover from the Second World War and the Allied occupation forces have the main say. Extremely impressive are authentic locations of devastated city, great photos, scenery and noir style. The atmosphere skillfully shows us all the anxiety caused by the beginnings of the Cold War. All this in a movie about two friends, who do not seem to know much about each other. They love the same woman.The bottom line is finding. The novelty is the black market. The element that has stepped up the plot. The problem is in man, not in situations. The story boils down to the suspicious death of a good friend which remains unsolved case of the third man. From that moment all the skilled thriller game between tension and climax. Very good dialogue accompanies even better humor that pervades between light joke to the grisly interruption.It is simply amazing to see well-constructed script in the complex drama. Despite the fact that after all the acts is calculated and well designed, the voltage is present. Of course, there those hasty turnaround, but when all is summed up would be superfluous.The acting is pretty good.Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins is in a double error. Friendship and romance. Alida Valli as Anna Schmidt is a good girl who chooses between the living and the ""dead"" man. The fact is that she runs away or just passing. Trevor Howard as Major Calloway is a British police major who with a lot of experience leading the investigation. The protagonist who took advantage of misleading in that they hoped the main characters. Orson Welles as Harry Lime is a treacherous criminal, friend and lover, who in the darkness shows the shadow of the third man.I'm just thrilled. In the last sentence I will boast of great music. Rhythmic, creepy, sad, provocative ... different and excellent."
zzhhhqing,"May 29, 2020",7/10,"It is said that Orson Wells appeared in ten minutes. He was lazy to go because the sewer was too stinky. The standing back in the tunnel at the end is for the director. The close-up close-up shot of the manhole cover was directed by the director. But the strange thing is that many people think that Orson Wells is the real protagonist of the movie, just like the title."
Tobot,"Dec 7, 2001",10/10,"What can I say? I guess it's summed up with the Zither music of Anton Karas, playing as the credits roll. The simple theme will stay in your head for days after you've left the theatre, one detail that's so light and fun you can't help but be charmed. So it is with every other detail of the film, actors with 5 lines seem like fully fleshed characters, and setpieces as simple as a sewer entrance are exotic little touches that make postwar Vienna seem almost like an alien world. Unlike the ""classic"" films of the last 20 years, The Third Man has no opinions on god, or death, it has no broad message, it's just a story. Just a single, luminous, story."

werefox08,"Apr 11, 2012",10/10,"The Third Man is a great movie. The four principle actors...Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotten, and Auda Valli are fantastic. The story and screen-play by Graham Green is superb. The music by Anton Karas is perfect. The photography by Robert Krascer is brilliant. The direction by Carol Reed is innovative and faultless. This is the original noir classic. Its Vienna after WW2 and racketeering is rife. The naive Holly Martins (a small time novelist from the U.S.A.) stumbles into town. He has to get smart quickly as he discovers that fact can be stranger than fiction....and much more deadly. Made in 1949 it remains an exemplary film in all ways. To-days ""special effects"" and CGI are what movie goers now want....which is a real shame. It means that the writers can get away with murder----by coming up with poor scripts, again and again. This is an INTELLIGENT movie....it requires full attention. They really cant make em like this anymore. This is a movie which is rightly celebrated by anyone who loves high class motion pictures."
stensson,"Nov 22, 2002",8/10,"Being in Vienna, you must of course see ""The Third Man"" if you have the chance, especially when it's shown with the original soundtrack. I did so.There aren't many pictures in film history having that splendid photo, in the sewers as well as out of them. But the charm of it is in the way people are behaving, like a glimpse from a lost paradise, although the plot is frightful.It is a beautiful story about friendship between men, one good and one evil, and of passionate love for a woman, which only grows into despair. The background is the bombed Vienna, which make things very special, like destiny looking over your shoulder. The film is probably more sensational now, then it was in 1949."
perfectbond,"Jan 15, 2004",9/10,"I recently saw this on the fantastic Criterion Collection DVD and like countless other was greatly impressed. I'm not sure I can add anything new but I must say that the the feeling of post war Vienna was captured so perfectly and that the cinematography of said setting was a star of the film as much as Cotten or Welles. What I like a lot is that there is no neat or even very poetic ending. Events transpire in a naturalistic fashion full of all the frustrations, disappointments, and unfulfilled expectations that make up life for so many people as they often fruitlessly struggle for some sort of contentment. My only quibble is that the soundtrack is somewhat overrated but that is only my individual opinion. Still a true classic, the film, and our first look at Lime, 9/10."
tomsview,"Feb 26, 2016",10/10,"Filmed as though the camera had one tripod leg shorter than the others, along with zithers, seductive shadows, echoing sewers, ferris wheels, cuckoo clocks and a magician's touch, this film is more of an experience than a movie. Impossible to remake, it also captures Vienna at a critical time just after WW2 when it was still occupied by the Allied powers.Even after 55 years, ""The Third Man"" has a compelling story, superb performances and enough style for ten films.And that story by Graham Greene stands up even when compared with all the brilliant mystery films over the intervening decades as well as literate crime series on TV such as ""Lewis"", ""Wallander"" and ""Vera"" etc.Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton), a rather nerdy, and slightly annoying writer of paperback westerns, arrives in post-war Vienna to discover that his good friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has supposedly been killed in an accident. He encounters suspicious British policemen (Trevor Howard and Bernard Lee), and also Harry's enigmatic and beautiful girlfriend Anna (Alida Valli). Eventually Holly learns things about Harry that trouble him deeply. It all leads to a confrontation in the cavernous sewers under Vienna.The film also features one of the most unexpected endings ever. I won't spoil it in case one of the five people who haven't seen the film happens to read this.Suffice to say that the original script had a more conventional ending and it was actually David O Selznick who came up with the one used in the film. It was always assumed that it was director Carol Reed's, but Charles Drazin in his fascinating book ""In Search of the Third Man"" pretty well pins it down to Selznick, who attempted to interfere with the whole production. Although ostensibly a British film, Selznick had money in it with Alexander Korda - before the inevitable falling-out.There is so much to observe and enjoy including Orson Welles' famous monologue, and the stunning Alida Valli. She was so beautiful, ""head-swivelingly beautiful"" as Martin Scorsese once said. Even the shapeless raincoat she wears for most of the film only makes those luminous features even more striking. She had already made a couple of Hollywood movies including Hitchcock's ""The Paradine Case"", another film where her mystique is caught if a little chillingly, and she wasn't even a Hitchcock blonde.Carol Reed went on to make other movies including ""The Man Between"", which tried to recapture the spirit of ""The Third Man"", this time set in Berlin. It even foreshadowed ""The Spy Who Came in from the Cold"", but it didn't have that self-contained, indefinable magic of ""The Third Man"". Maybe it's only one true masterpiece per customer, although Reed's batting average was always strong.Whatever the case, ""The Third Man"" has lost none of its lustre and more than lives up to its reputation. I'd have to say it's a desert island disc for me."
andyrogers,"May 24, 2001",N/A,"Ever since I was a boy I can remember my mother commenting on the end of the film with the words "" ooh grandad hates the end with Orson Welles' hands poking throogh the drainhole"".  Sorry Mum and Grandad, I love this film despite the corny ending. Everything about it is masterly - the pace never lets up, the suspense likewise and there are some wonderful set pieces, even more so when you consider that the clever mr Welles wrote the ""cuckoo clock"" speech himself. The settings are drab and austere and into this world steps our hero Holly Martins played by my all time favourite actor, Joseph Cotton.  Why doesn't he make more of a play for the girl in the same way as he doesn't give chasing the elusive Lime?  This only becomes apparent after watching the film a few times because initially you realise she is besotted with the black marketeer Lime. All the supporting roles are superb - even down to the snotty little kid who puts the finger on Martins.  There are darkly suspicious European characters drifting in and out of the scene and a very dodgy ""little dawg"", as Cotton refers to it. You really build an affinity with Lime even though he is a criminal mastermind and into very dodgy dealings and it is a shame that it has to end in tears, in a sewer of all places - well, where do you expect rats to end their days?? Perhaps the star of the show is Trevor Howard playing a laconic army official who seems rather weary of the whole nonsense.  The punch on the nose from his sergeant is most probably what Howard ordered for the loud American nuisance! Don't miss this one - I put it on when there's nobody else around the place and escape into that monochrome world of postwar Vienna. Who needs pearl Harbour or Bridget Jones??"
Thanos_Alfie,"Jan 30, 2015",7/10,"""The Third Man"" is a mystery movie in which we have a novelist who travels to shadowy, postwar Vienna because of the death of one friend of him. When he arrives there though he finds himself trying to investigate the mysterious death of his old friend.I liked this movie because of the plot and even though it's an old movie it had a good storyline. Also the direction of Carol Reed was equally good. I have to admit that I did not expect to like this movie at first but after the first ten minutes of the movie I was surprised. About the interpretations, I have to say that I liked Joseph Cotten's who played the novelist Holly Martins and of course the beautiful Alida Valli who played as Anna Schmidt.Finally I have to say that ""The Third Man"" is a really good movie with nice plot and I believe that if you are a fan of mystery movies then this will be one of your favorite movies."
merrywater,"Apr 22, 2015",10/10,"There are some movies that simply are so captivating and well-crafted that you might, for a moment, doubt their very existence: This is such a movie.Based on a great novel, there were still lots that could have gone wrong when adapting the story for the screen.(1) Casting: I have practically no complaints. Even the animals (a cat and a parrot) were great. If there would have been one remark, it would consider the janitor at Lime's place and his shifting knowledge of the English language.(2) Directing: so solid that it has to be reckoned as one of the pillars of golden age cinematography. Welles apparently wanted to take credits from Carol Reed. That says quite a lot.(3) Setting: Brilliant! Wienna as a lugubrious and damp ghost town filled with odd people, mostly viewed in close-ups - silent, tormented faces.(4) Plot: Believable enough. Actually a bit of a MacGuffin; the emotional drama is the true story, but it wouldn't have worked without the detective hyperplot. The title itself could be given almost a double entendre with respect to the famous final scene: the female protagonist has lost the first man, ignored the second, and eventually walks towards the third. Well, a bit over analytical, but...5) Soundtrack: Very unusual. A Hungarian zither player got international reputation merely out of this movie. The producer thought about everything, as it seems..."
Nick-57,"Oct 14, 2003",10/10,"A masterpiece from all aspects. The black and white cinematography depicting each detail (and wow what shadows), the cast of splendid actors and actress, even those playing minor roles, not sparing any facial details!!   And oh what  background of Zither music. They surely do not make such movies any more."
neilhumphreys-55732,"Dec 18, 2022",4/10,"I felt so disappointed with this film. People built this up to be a classic and I was upset when it did not fulfill expectation. The cinematic photography was top notch and the acting was first rate. The setting was fantastic and seeing old parts of Vienna was a ""look back in time"" for anyone. Unfortunately for me the story just did not cut the mustard. The film noir gene is an acquired taste and I am truly sorry but it is not mine. To me the film was vastly overrated and the stars it gets are given people who are rating it for other things other than the actual plot. Yes other aspects of the movie are great but you cannot look past a bad script."
RossLikesMovies,"Oct 23, 2005",10/10,"Their really isn't much more I can say about the Third Man. It is an amazing film and was a landmark in the history of cinema. Its an inimitable piece of film making in every way. Robert Kraskers photography was groundbreaking, amazing and in my eyes still the most beautiful, perfectly photographed work in history. The unique blend of creeping shadows and spectacular filming angles are one of the main standouts in the film.Rarely has a film had a better cast. Joseph Cotten is perfect in his role as Holly Martins. Orson Welles almost steals the whole show with his almost cameo like performance as the elusive Harry Lime.The story in the Third Man is intriguing and ultimately satisfying. It isn't the strongest point of the film, but is still admirable. The story is really just a basis for the excellent character interaction and dialogue on display.To conclude, the Third Man is an essential film, one that should be seen by everybody. It is cinema at its most sub-lime!"
MissRosa,"Oct 4, 2000",10/10,"NOTES ON THE THIRD MANThe Third Man -- it's Freud! it's Kafka! it's Hitchcock! It's Conrad! It's Fellini!  It's Nietzche! It's Machiavelli! It's all the above and more: it's Orson Welles... and the Notes on the GREATNESS of THE THIRD MAN.Two's company, three's a crowd. The title hints of a character who has surpassed the ordinary; who has defied conventional restraints; an outsider; a modern Kurtz [Heart of Darkness]. No coincidence that a sinister, cynical Kurtz actually exists in the film.Of what is Lime guilty anyway? How guilty is he?  What has he done? Does it even matter? For a long time, he is nowhere in sight. We don't know where he is, if he even exists, or if the terrible rumors about him are true. So why do we so desperately want to meet him and hear his side of the story? We begin to identify with this mystery man, we want to side with him.Only one thing is certain as the story unrolls: Harry Lime has gone too far and he must pay the price.Joseph Cotten plays an artistically-compromised American writer, who is too naive -- in his charming American way -- to realize it. Can he even begin to offer the insight and integrity needed to evaluate Lime's guilt or innocence, the evidence we long to disavow?Then there is Harry's American girlfriend. She is depressed by Harry but is mentally loyal to his ""memory.""TouchPointsThe transcendently evil character to whom a genuine, yet inexperienced character is inexplicably and irrevocably drawn through a long, convoluted journey toward absolute darkness. (Conrad)Vienna, the city of intellect, intrigue, and ambition with its dark streets, gothic shadows and subterranean sewers providing the ultimate metaphor for the mind (Freud) Life as a dizzying carnival of dizzying perceptions of good and evil, sin and salvation, and the relentless need to make choices. (Fellini)The investigation of murder, and the subsequent surprises, secrets and thrills that unveil character and motive. The use of creative sound, light and cinematography to embroil the viewer in the hunt. Tall buildings and dizzying heights. The propensity to fall from grace. (Hitchcock)The presumption of guilt as a foundational assumption of  modern life. The chaos, frustration, loneliness and deep fears occasioned by endless and inescapable and endless bureaucratic and architectural webs, mazes, and tangles. (Kafka)This is certainly one of the top ten films of all time -- if not, in fact, number one. It's complexity continues to fascinate, amaze, entertain, awe. It is perfect."
goldengoose21,"Jul 11, 2004",10/10,"do you guys think that anyone in the third man is truly innocent? and do the characters take advantage of the ""innocent"" people because innocence is a weakness? or is it because they are loyal and have morality etc, like martins? i am of the opinion that the porter is the character that is the most innocent, but then he did hide the truth from the police to protect himself... and then holly could be innocent, but going by one of the dictionary definitions of innocent, he is by no means foolishly trustful. and how do you feel about the ending, the anti-Hollywood factor, where anna walks straight past holly. that i feel was the only way to end the film. anything else would have been untrue to the story. also, i've seen 2 spellings of popescu- popescu and popesco. which is correct?? and one more thing... how good is the zither!"
palmiro,"Nov 16, 2003",10/10,"Just a few notes on exceptional scenes, what's in them and what's not: 1) the ending, the framed shot that lingers for 50 seconds as Anna advances down the esplanade of the cemetery towards Holly and beyond; 2) the hospital scene: not a single shot of the children, but the tattered teddy bear was enough; 3) the wait for Harry to show in the cafe`: the close-ups of the faces of the military men waiting in ambush were straight out of Leni Riefenstahl's ""Triumph of the Will"" and with the same dramatic impact; 4) the total absence of sizzling sex scenes, profanity, & gory violence (with one exception, none of the men killed is seen being killed, and in that one case there is no gore, only a quick hitting sadness); 5) and couldn't it have been just possible that Anna was wanted by the Soviets as a war criminal? Here's where Graham Greene's screenplay was strictly Cold War boilerplate: The Russians were necessarily the ""bad guys,"" prepared to harbor a scumbag like Lime and persecute a sensitive soul like ""Anna Schmidt"" (maybe she'd been the lover of a high-ranking Nazi commander of a death camp and had shared in his sadistic delights). And, finally, the bozos in this column who disliked the music because it had an ""Hawaiian sound"" must have thought they were listening to Arthur Godfrey on the ukelele rather than Anton Karas' zither. Cold War boilerplate or not: 10 out of 10."
cataldoa,"Jan 12, 2004",N/A,"Finally, I saw it.  I bought the DVD and watched it two days ago. It's a very good movie.  A very good story, with very good performances and an excellent direction.I don't like to compare movies or to make rankings of them.  Why we have always to compare things?  Is it important if a movie is the best or the 50th in any list ?The most relevant thing (in my opinion):  a movie is a good one if I remain thinking on its story and its scenes for a long time after seeing it.  It seems to be the case with ""The Third Man"".The highest points: a) in the final chase, the fingers on the street; b) in the child hospital, no child is seen.  There's no need of it.  It's good direction. c) the final scene, of course.  If Anna had walked to Holly, we probably would not remember the end of the movie for a long time.No doubt: it's a very good movie."
Prince-P,"Jan 5, 2023",7/10,"In the film, a young American writer arrives in postwar Vienna. He has been promised a job by his friend Harry Lime, but soon discovers that the friend was killed in an accident. But is Harry Lime really dead?In the autumn of 1949, the English director Carol Reed was at the peak of his career. He had in fast pace made three films - ""Odd Man Out"", ""The Fallen Idol"" and ""The Third Man"" - all of which would come to be regarded as modern classics. Carol Reed continued to direct movies for many more years (he even won an Oscar for ""Oliver"" in 1968) but would never make a film of that stature again.In 1940s England, most movies were shot on the companies' sound stages. But Carol Reed had other ideas. ""Odd Man Out"" was filmed in Belfast, while he brought his crew to Vienna to make ""The Third Man"". Where Reed got into trouble. The film's star, Orson Welles, refused to go down into the city's foul-smelling sewers for the dramatic chase sequence. Instead Reed had to use a body double, dressed in Welles' clothes for the scene.One evening when Carol Reed wandered around Vienna, scouting locals, he heard street musician Anton Karas playing outside a bar. Reed was immediately fascinated by the zither player, and decided to use his music as the theme of his film. This, in turn, made the unknown musician famous. After touring all over Europe, Karas could open a nightclub in Vienna in the '50s, aptly named ""Der Dritte Mann"".""The Third Man"" is filled with lots of unusual angles where the camera is tilted so that the horizon line is not horizontal at all. This is because Carol Reed wanted to create a feeling of uncertainty in the audience. After seeing the film, director William Wyler sent a spirit level to his good friend Reed, with a note attached: ""Carol, the next time you make a picture, just put this on top of the camera, will you?"""
joezelja,"Jan 8, 2026",6/10,"I really like the idea of setting the story in Vienna. Europe is an unusual and refreshing location for a black-and-white noir film, we're so used to this genre being rooted in America (with Casablanca as a rare exception), so this was a genuine surprise and, on paper, a great choice.That said, I feel the film had much more potential than what it actually delivered. Despite its strong reputation and high rating, I honestly don't think The Third Man fully deserves it. The story feels thin and not nearly detailed enough for this type of film. Everything moves too fast, as if the narrative was rushed, and I think it should have been handled with far more care.The supporting characters initially seem like they will carry some real weight, but they quickly lose their importance as the story progresses. While I truly appreciate the post-war Austrian setting and the atmosphere it tries to create, the film ultimately left me disappointed. The ideas are strong, but the execution falls short."
IceQueen99,"May 14, 2022",5/10,"The cinematography is wonderful, but I fail to see the attraction of the ordinary story. And the gawd awful, relentless mind-numbing music makes it almost unwatchable."
Charles Foster Kane,"Feb 5, 2002",10/10,"As we all know, Citizen Kane is often lauded ""Greatest Film of All Time"". Whilst I would never dispute this, keep in mind that ""Best"" doesn't mean the same as ""Favourite"". Kane is influential, important and is required viewing for anyone with even a cursory interest in film. However, it can be a difficult watch if your not in the right mood. The Third Man, on the other hand, is a joy from start to finish. From the (perfectly) cast to Robert Krasker's outstanding cinematography, the film persists in staggering me every time. Technically speaking, The Third Man is on a par with Citizen Kane and rarely gets the credit for it. The reason for this is simply because,  whatever skill,craft and/or effort was displayed for the film, it is unobtrusive. All the composite elements (photography,design,editing etc) seem so perfectly suited to eachother, to the point where they're rendered almost ""invisible"". However, whilst watching Citizen Kane, you're always conscious of it being such a (staggeringly) well put together film. Which seems, to me, to run counter to the whole ""Magic of Cinema"" thing. The ""Magic of Cinema"" thing being where you can let go and enter the world you're being presented with. Which becomes increasingly more difficult, the more you're aware of the technicalities of filmaking, however impressive they may be. So, sit back and enjoy quite the finest example of ""Romantic Thrillers""........ The Third Man. My favourite film, though not necessarily the best."
Mr Yu,"Jun 25, 2002",10/10,"The perfect ending, the great theme that will play in your head for days afterwards, love, post war Vienna, black market scams, a faked death, a friends betrayal for what is right and Welles. If you have any doubt about how good this genius was, check this movie out. He's on the screen for about 10 minutes, yet steals the film from the brilliant performances of Joseph Cotton, Trevor Howard etc. The classic bad guy that somehow you can't bring yourself to hate.Check it out and see if you can hate Orson when he flashes you that smile."

cosmicly,"Oct 11, 2004",N/A,"I must dismiss my bias, up front, by telling all of you that this is my all-time favorite movie. For me, it crystallizes the ultimate Hamletiam predicament, the tearing apart that occurs that when your best-loved best friend turns out to be a rotten scoundrel. An opportunistic person whose lust for wealth tramples on the medical needs of wounded soldiers, pregnant women and suffering children. This movie is filled with comic relief moments, but what makes it excel is the ultimate test of the moral dilemma. What do we choose, an amazingly and seductively appealing friend who happens to destroy lives with his greed, or an obnoxious bureaucracy that just happens to be morally right in this case?One comment on the moral cloudiness of the current generation. I would bet anything that more viewers side with Harry Lime, today, than against him..."
Vartiainen,"Aug 24, 2017",6/10,"An example from the classic era of film noir. Director Carol Reed introduces us to post-war Vienna filled with harsh angles, Gothic shadows, lonely streets and gleaming streetlamps. Pulp novelist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotten) arrives to the city looking for a job his good friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles) has promised him. Immediately upon arrival he finds out that Lime has been run over by a car. Police think it a simple accident, but Martins has other ideas.Reed is a known expressionist and this shows heavily in the film. Dutch angles fill almost every shot and a lot of time is given for the buildup and the atmosphere of the city. And the film is to be praised for this. Many of the shots seem eerily familiar to the viewer. Not because you've seen the film but because so many later directors and cinematographers have been influenced by it. The shot of Lime's shadow looming against a wall as he slowly approaches is a fine, fine piece of film making and the most iconic the film has.Eerily familiar also describes the story to a tee, but in this case that is not a compliment. The plot is fairly easy to predict, despite of it containing some pretty clever twists. I can only imagine how revolutionary a film such as this one must have seemed like back on its day. But now, as someone who has watched so many other similar films... Well, it honestly makes the film something of a bore. I can appreciate it visually and the actors are extremely talented, but the story didn't leave me with much.And this is honestly the problem with a lot of mid-century films. At least for yours truly. There is something to be said about being one of the first to do something. But if that thing continues to be done better and better throughout the years, is it okay, at some point, to let the first examples go. Am I doing this film and others like it a disservice by not having seen them earlier when I would have been more able to appreciate them?Perhaps. Or perhaps history and time march on, like they always do. Nevertheless, it's a fine film. Very well made, very well acted. And the story is a good one. The fact that it has been made again so many times since then is a testament to that."
Seraphion,"Jun 13, 2015",6/10,"The story evolved nice and steadily from a simple curiosity into a mystery case and then unravels into a crime investigation drama and ends up very well in a spy movie flavored finale. The title doesn't only explain the mystery but also elaborates on what's going on between Holly and Anna, or at least what Holly thinks is going on between them. Watching this movie now, it feels very predictable all the way. But as I see the movie being released more than fifty years ago, I think the twists will give great awe to the audience. The acting work is quite a bit above the standard level, seeing all the actors really need to work more on their facial expressions."
cruiseabout,"Jan 4, 2001",10/10,"TIME OUT's Readers Top One Hundred place The Third Man 15th, and the filmmakers' Centenary poll only 49th, but for my money this must rank among the handful of truly great, perfect films of all time.A memorable script by Graham Greene, director Carol Reed at his best, inspired noir photography from Robert Krasker, and that famously irresistible zither music from Anton Karas added to what must be Orson Welles' most haunting role. Although he doesn't appear in person until fairly late in the film, his character, Harry Lime, pervades practically every scene. Joseph Cotten may appear an unusual choice to play the American Innocent Abroad, but he is ideal as the man from the New World who is completely out of place in the Old. And Alida Valli is also perfectly cast as the world weary refugee, stateless, obsessed and vulnerable. The film grips from the start, but builds up to an exciting and frenetic climax with the justly famous chase through Vienna's sewers. And that ending... Apparently Graham Green had proposed a happier ending, however the famous final long shot, with Cotton waiting at the side of the road, and Anna walking towards him down the cemetery road through its litter of fallen leaves... is an image that has kept with me ever since I first saw this, perhaps most favoured of favourite, film. A footnote: if you enjoyed this film, try to catch the film Reed made immediately prior to it, ""The Fallen Idol""."

Though it left lacking because of the profound effect Orson had on me in Kane.Effects were good so far as playing with shadow and sound used to help build the the who done it suspense.

TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews,"Feb 12, 2010",10/10,"This is the only Carol Reed film I've watched so far, and I most definitely do not intend it to be the last. The story is immediately engaging, and the setting, post-WWII Vienna, where crime is an all too common thing, is stunning and draws you in. This also has amazing cinematography and editing, with some camera angles that I have not seen in anything from the late 40's, or many other places, for that matter. The lighting is also gorgeous. I understand that this is British Noir, a sub-genre I don't believe I've been exposed to before. The script is marvelous. Every character is great, well-developed and credible, and the dialog is all sharp and delivered with perfect timing. The plot is brilliant, compelling and intriguing, and not so convoluted that you can't follow it, or even require a second viewing to piece it all together, and the mystery and its conclusion are satisfying. Every acting performance is spot-on, and there is a lot of charm and chemistry to it. Heck, *the kid*, whose age I cannot possibly imagine had hit double digits at the time, is quite good, and certainly convincing. This actually uses other languages than English when it makes sense, German and Russian, often broken. Tension and suspense is built up well in this. The only negative I can really say about this is that the score, whenever it appears in the last half of the picture, is disruptive and draws attention to itself in how little it fits in tone with what's going on. I have experienced that in other older movies. There is a bit of disturbing content and brief mild to moderate violence in this. I recommend this to any fan of those who made it, and this type of fiction. 10/10"
tom_lamont,"Jan 26, 2001",10/10,This is a truly great noir film.  The music and filming add tremendously. It kept my attention throughout and has some good plot twists.  Wells is wonderful as Harry Lime.  The juxtaposition of one of the scenes shown early in the film and then a scene showing basically the same near the end is affecting.  The film captures the anguish and unsettled conditions of post-WWII Vienna.
dermotwinston,"Jan 2, 2006",10/10,"The Third Man is the best film I've ever seen. All scenes memorable. So many lines will stay with me. A haunting film. The scene where Harry appears at the station is the start of an emotional journey. This is a timeless story of a search for a lost friend. The music of Anton Karras is essential to the mood.The words of Harry (Orson Welles): ""In Italy for thirty years under the Borgias they had warfare, terror, murder, bloodshed - but they produced Michelangelo, Leonardo da Vinci and the Renaissance. In Switzerland they had brotherly love, five hundred years of democracy and what did that produce - the cuckoo clock!"" are a great counterpoint to his earlier words in the ferris wheel and his disregard for human life: ""You know, I never feel comfortable on these sort of things. Victims? Don't be melodramatic. Tell me. Would you really feel any pity if one of those dots stopped moving forever? If I offered you twenty thousand pounds for every dot that stopped, would you really, old man, tell me to keep my money, or would you calculate how many dots you could afford to spare? Free of income tax, old man. Free of income tax - the only way you can save money nowadays.The scene where Alida is about to depart on the train, leaving Holly, is a haunting reminder of betrayal: ""They have a name for faces like that..""Watch the scene in the children's' hospital ""They gave it some of Lime's penicillin...terrible shame..."" without a twinge of compassion and you're not human!The closing scene where Anna walks past Holly Martins down the cemetery road is a signal of the betrayed and lost love."

It helped define the boundaries of film noir with its tilted camera angles, deliberate shadows, clever dialogue and unflinching observation of some of the worst parts of human nature.I recommend it thoroughly to anyone with an interest in old-school film noir."
CinemaSerf,"Jan 4, 2023",7/10,"Joseph Cotton (""Holly"") arrives in post war Vienna to meet up with his former school friend ""Harry Lime"" - only to discover that he was recently killed in an automobile accident. Without his promised job, he starts to chat with the friends of the dead man and swiftly spots some inconsistencies that lead him to become suspicious. He determines to try and find out just quite what happened. It becomes harder and harder for ""Holly"" to get straight answers - even from those whom he ought to be able to rely upon - ""Maj. Calloway"" (Trevor Howard) nor even ""Anna"" (Alida Valli), the dead man's lover - seem to be able (or willing to help). Gradually, also, he begins to suspect that he is being followed. Pinpricks of light from cigarettes in the shadows, shifting bodies hugging the dimly lit doorways - and he begins to realise that maybe his friend was not quite as scrupulous and honourable as he might have wished or appeared. Right from Anton Karas playing the distinctive zither theme at the top of the film we are treated to a wonderfully evocative adaptation of Graham Greene's mystery thriller and Carol Reed really does well with the pace of this too. We do make progress, but ""Holly"" has to work hard - as do we - for it, and his shady protagonists remain in the shadows, really effectively. This is a super story of trust, loyalty and greed that really is still as good now as it was 70 years ago."
Spleen,"Jan 9, 2000",8/10,"I'm among those who were disappointed upon first seeing `the greatest British film of the 20th Century' (I don't think it's THAT; and anyway, what's with the `of the 20th century' clause?  It's not as if there are any serious contenders from the previous century) - and I was still a trifle disappointed upon seeing it a second time, in a cinema.  Not that I disliked it on either occasion.Part of the problem is that I knew too much about the story.  I'm sure you will enjoy your first viewing of `The Third Man' at least twice as much if you know as little as possible about it beforehand.  There are people out there who think that if a film is fifty years old it's okay to give away all the surprises, as if we know them all at birth anyway.  And then there are those who think that if a film is any good to begin with it can stand having its secrets revealed.  Well, yes: people will still take DIMINISHED pleasure in `The Third Man', as I did, if they know what's going to happen.  They will also still get some pleasure out of it if forced to watch it from uncomfortable seats.  That's no argument in favour of uncomfortable seats. Anyway: you should be VERY careful what you allow yourself to read about this film before you see it.  Look over all the comments here with fitful, darting eyes.  That applies to my comments, too.  Anyone who hasn't seen the movie should stop reading now.  Please take this warning seriously.I'm not too fond of the ending - that pursuit through the sewers.  (Although the VERY end, the coda, that long shot of the tree-lined street, was just perfect - as good a closing shot as I have ever seen.)  This is the kind of ending you get when no-one can think of an ending.  Maybe it would work better if Harry Lime were a sympathetic character; but despite what so many people say, he's NOT a sympathetic character, and he isn't meant to be; or if he IS meant to be, then Graham Greene and Carol Reed and Orson Welles have misunderstood their own creation.  Obviously, Lime is meant to have some charm.  He's meant to have whatever it takes to win over Anna and Holly.  But he's not there to win US over, not even in the slightest degree. `The Third Man' is the story of someone who is close friends with a man who, as WE recognise, is a monster.  We're shown that he's a monster before we even meet him and sense that he's up to no good long before that. However laden with charm Welles's performance may be it comes too late to fool us.  In any event, Harry Lime is clearly the kind of charmer who works on one victim at a time, and he never gets a spare moment to cast his spell over the audience.  I think, though, that everyone assumed that this MUST be the story of a likeable rogue, including perhaps the writer, which is why the film's climax never really ignites.That's my only complaint about the film itself.  In fact I agree with all the other favourable remarks people have made, about the story, characters, presentation and music - I only wish I had been allowed to watch the film in the correct frame of mind."
hedgehog-10,"Mar 7, 1999",10/10,"A film loaded with excellent camera work, dialogue, direction and art direction. Every time I watch this film you can feel the cold, bleak Austrian post-war atmosphere. Orson Welles is superbly handled by Carol Reed, and gives one of his best acting performances. One of my all-time favourite films."
invisibleunicornninja,"Dec 21, 2018",5/10,"So I got about halfway through this movie before stopping, and I just have to ask - why is it one of the highest rated movies? Its boring. Also the soundtrack is distraction. Also the story is disorganized. There's just nothing that good or memorable about it."
janetkchang,"Aug 21, 2001",10/10,"Why did I wait so long to watch this film?  Only the Lord knows.  But what I saw made me find peace:  I now know what my favorite film is.  I'm sure of it!  Before, I toyed around with the ideas of ""Breakfast at Tiffany's"" (1961) or ""Random Harvest"" (1942), but now I know that I have been waiting to fall in love with ""The Third Man"" all my life.The cinematography, script, acting, editing, sound, production design--all superb.  Need I go into why?  It was like the gods decided to let all of those Hollywood elements fall into place perfectly so that the ultimate film could be made.As a big romantic film buff, my first question after the film was naturally, ""So, do Martins and Schmidt get together?"", but that was immediately drowned out by, ""Oh my God, what a film!"" thoughts filling my head.  I really started loving it the moment the different establishing shots of Vienna started flashing.  Some of the editing there reminded me of editing in films that were released within the past two years--surely, ""The Third Man"" was the originator!Joseph Cotten made a smashing heartthrob and a hero when I saw him in ""Gaslight"" (1944), and he continues in that status in this film.  I thought that Valli was striking in ""The Paradine Case"" (1947), but she *really* shines here.  And that first shot of Orson Welles, when the light in the upper bedroom window flashes on and he smiles that subtly diabolical smile--you just know that no one else could have played it the way that he did.  Forget ""Citizen Kane"" (1941) for now.  Really, do.  He is my favorite here.The DVD from the Criterion Collection is a must-own.  I will order it first thing tomorrow morning.  The only gripe that I have is that there is no suitable soundtrack...I really want Anton Kara's zither music.   It really is totally unique, and fits eerily AND romantically well in this film. Surely director Carol Reed's move to use only the zither  music as the primary soundtrack was exemplary, leading to the similar use of one primary artist in such films as 2000's ""Finding Forrester"".  There is a unity and special quality that such soundtracks lend to films, and Reed started it.The feel of this film is what films like 1999's ""The Talented Mr. Ripley"" aims to recreate.  Will it ever happen?  I highly doubt it.  But until it does, ""The Third Man"" will fill a warm space in our hearts, and I am not one to complain.Now if you'll excuse me, I must go search for that soundtrack."
no-skyline,"Apr 5, 2005",10/10,"I've often heard people say a film is timeless but never found that to be the case until seeing the Third Man. Recently i've been catching up on a lot of old films (Hitchcock, Boggart, Cagney, old musicals etc.) and due to their age even the great films date, thats in someways part of the charm a different style of dialogue and film making than todays films. But watching this film with the exception of the picture quality (i was watching and old VHS version) this film really could have been made yesterday. I just can't believe it was made back in the 40's it just seems so modern, i'm sure many of the techniques used are still being copied today.As has often been noted Welles is superb as Harry Lime and the cuckoo clock speech must go down as one of the greatest in cinema history. In some ways his performance as Lime even outdoes his role in Citizen Caine as he dominates the film with so little screen time. But the real star of the show is the depiction of a war ravaged Vienna all menace and shadow. The supporting cast are all superb and the musical score is one of the most memorable i've heard.One thing to note is how shocking this film must have been back only four years after world war II had ended. It's easy now to look back on this as a historical piece yet these characters were representative of real people at the time.I can't recommend this film enough, if you in anyway love film you should see this. It's not an ageing classic, its a truly timeless masterpiece.Rating 9/10"
jackmunro,"Dec 8, 2002",10/10,"This movie is so good that I barely feel qualified to comment on it. I first saw it as a 7 year old  in the early 50s and, although unable at the time to appreciate its full qualities, I remained strangely moved by it and have been haunted by it ever since. This is the only perfect movie ever made. I guess most of the great things about photography and charisma and zither theme and story have been said by people far more articulate than I. However, there are two points I would like to make. Firstly, the camera angles seem to be designed to preclude the viewer from ever being comfortable in involvement with what is not meant to be a comfortable story. Secondly, the ending is just perfect, but the scene just prior to the ending is even more so. Watch as Lime is trapped in the sewer and Calloway tells Martins to shoot him. Harry turns to Holly and gives an almost imperceptible nod, and Holly pulls the trigger. Now that has some impact!"
ctosangel-2,"Feb 2, 2001",10/10,"Much better than the Graham Greene book, this historic film has improved the original and passing by has become one of the cinema best movie pictures in all the world. History, atmosphere, photography, interpretation... All in this fabulous picture is very good indeed and each time is better. For ever ten!"
ThomasDrufke,"May 21, 2015",6/10,"If it weren't for the fact that the film is on the Top 250 on IMDb, I probably wouldn't have even heard of it at first, but being that it's Orson Welles, and I have since heard so many great things about this film-noir, I decided to give it a shot. Unfortunately, The Third Man doesn't live up to it's reputation for me. With a twist that is predictable from the very first scene, to the slow paced rest of the film, The Third Man is just an average film.I tend to love film-noir's. In fact I adore The Big Sleep and Double Indemnity to name a few, but this one failed to peak my interest. Granted there is a terrific performance by Alida Valli, and Orson Welles, being one of the great screen legends of all time, does make an appearance (Yeah he's really only in it for 30 minutes). So that's all great, but the score is distracting and feels like a 60's western, the pacing is abnormally slow, and nothing really happens until the final 15 minutes or so. Which I have to admit, was a great way to end the film. In fact the final chase/shootout is definitely worth re-watching. There is also a clichéd romance that develops between leads that doesn't feel genuine for nearly the entire film (but I did like where that eventually ended up).It's just hard to get over a film that has glaring weaknesses across the board. It also didn't help that the back cover of the copy of the film that I watched spoiled the twist for me, not that I didn't already know, but it would have helped to have at least some percentage of doubt. The bottom line is that there is a lot of about the film I didn't like and a lot I thought was done really well. So I'm pretty dead even on this film. But I'll give the film the benefit of the doubt until I watch it again someday.+Valli+Thrilling final sequence+Welles-Twist is predictable-Score-Slowly paced6.0/10"
kpxr2943,"Mar 15, 2005",10/10,"A beautiful coalescence of outstanding cinematography, career-defining acting prowess, and great scriptwriting. Every character actor turns in Oscar-caliber performances. Alida Valli is a match for Ingrid Bergman at her best. Joseph Cotton is a pleasure to watch. Neither actor reached this level before or again in their careers. Never has music so aptly suited a film's setting. The atmosphere is worth reveling in time after time, with several scenes that stick in the memory for a lifetime. A movie that most people will watch several times over. The Criterion collection DVD is very well restored, with interesting extras. Better than Citizen Kane on every front. Belongs in any film-buff's collection."
LetsReviewThat26,"Mar 15, 2025",6/10,"The third man might not have a lot of thrills but what it does have has been done very well. Holly martins travels to vienna to find an old mate of his that he has not seen in years called harry lime. Upon arrival he is informed that harry has infact died and they have a faunal, after which he is also told that from a lady called anna and the police is that he is a theif but not believing such things holly goes on the such for a truth and might get more than he bargained for. The classic black and white films can be some of the best and I enjoyed this movie. There was also a cute dog and kitty. Wells is his usual subtle self and always has an air of mystery which makes him brilliant."
Horror-yo,"Apr 12, 2017",4/10,"To address some of the criticism point by point made in my title there, yes this film is boring: its pace is exaggeratedly slow throughout all of its playtime and at times downright ridiculous, like the chase at the end for example, it just never ends.The points that need to be made could often have been made with either more luster, or quicker, or just been better altogether - much of the film if not all of it is just basically narrative, to the point I would ask what the difference would be between watching the actual film here, or just reading the script. It just carries out a totally linear story and it's basically just dialogue and the film fails at making itself interesting to the audience. Sure this may've been original or what not at the time, but as a film on its own there's really very little strength to it, I mean the whole point and idea of the film (won't be disclosed here) is a fairly ordinary story overall and the twist may be interesting but to have all this completely underwhelming, boring old film attached to it is far too bad a deal for such a quick fix at the end.It's also annoying, sonically: loud voices throughout, the debilitating omnipresence of that Hawaii-ish guitar theme...it's just often very loud and an annoyance. Then the fact it tries hard to be stylistic with tilted odd camera angles, or unsubtle transitions like the camera zooming in on that flower pot and into the street...Overall one could get the impression there's far too little going on, the film settles for telling some story it picked to tell and there's more talking than anything, is recurrently very slow... and what goes on just isn't interesting or important enough to ever get the right momentum going."
mamasonthree-1,"Jan 30, 2007",10/10,"This evening I joined a group of my neighbors in viewing ""The Third Man"". I owned a copy in VHS format a few years ago but had given it to a former neighbor as a going away remembrance when I moved back to Southern California.The viewing this evening was a well received diversion to the commercialism of today's so-called technical entertainment! To travel back in time and be reminded of the greatness of characters and architectural structures of older European cities during the war era brought a bittersweet joy to my heart! Not only did the storyline and characters performance keep me glued to the movie but the invitation to my spirit by the haunting melody performed by Anton Karras on the zither was unquestionably acceptable.To think I and this masterpiece was being born concurrently truly gives me a sense of greatness!"
FutileWill,"Dec 20, 2001",10/10,"This movie has everything--drama, suspense, intrigue, romance, humor with a perfect cast, post-war Vienna setting, one of the best movie theme music played on the zither and an unexpected final scene.  Graham Greene is one of my favorite novelists.  Attempts have been made to transfer most of his novels to the screen, but this is is the only one that is completely satisfactory."
TheLostCorleone,"Feb 9, 2003",10/10,"Everything and everyone around me seemed to beg me to see The Third Man. It is the all-time favorite movie of a couple film-buff friends of mine.  It is the British Academy's #1 movie of all-time.  It is praised to this day by every credible film professor and critic in the world.  I finally got to see it on an old grainy tape on a small screen in my university's library media room.After the ending credits started rolling, I walked out of the library totally awestruck.  The cinematography was perfect; it was as if Citizen Kane's revolutionary techniques were honed to an even more immaculate edge. The pacing of the plot was perfect; never once had there been either a boring moment or a break in the suspense.  The characters are cleverly ambiguous and incredibly deep; no one is in the right or in the wrong completely.  Harry Lime (Orson Welles) is one of the most haunting and vicious, yet at the same time one of the most charismatic characters I have ever seen on film.  The dialogue is nothing short of intense wit and haunting wisdom (note Harry Lime's ""cuckoo clock"" speech).The Third Man is definitely a movie I plan to revisit again, and again, and again.  I definitely can't claim to have caught everything this first time around, and there were many things that slipped over my head and wish to catch again.  But when a film catches your complete admiration on first viewing and makes you want to revisit it over again, I'd say it is definitely a film worth catching if you can.10/10, and personally my 4th all-time at the moment (that could go up on subsequent viewings)."
Spondonman,"Oct 3, 2004",N/A,"I watched this last night on BBC4 and surprised myself by possibly enjoying it more than when I saw it at the cinema a few years back. I think this would be because, like Star Wars/Empire any faults show up much more clearly on a big screen to the viewer and (can) detract from the spectacle. I mean, Lucas's digital restoration couldn't prevent the flying machines sporting halos and wobble - time ruins special effects! But it gets by on TV. In The Third Man's case, what we see was pieced back together by Carol Reed after loss by fire of the first edit, leading to a few dodgy joins, mismatched ambiences and slight continuity leaps, all the more apparent after all this time on bigger screens. But it adds a realist feel to a movie already frothing with dark and brooding atmosphere.Having said that, I've now seen TTM about 10 times over the years and still find it a magical experience, with a subject that should sicken and depress but I end up drowned in admiration for a film that has certainly stood the test of time in most departments, with brilliant direction/photography/acting and music.I should imagine everything's been said about it by now, but I would like to comment on its status as Britain's Best Film. Reminder: it was made mainly with American money, mainly in Vienna, with an international cast, crew and even equipment. It's what we do best!"
DennisLittrell,"Sep 5, 2002",10/10,"I'm not one to rave about ""glorious black and white"" cinematography. Generally speaking, if it was good in black and white, it would be even better in color (but NOT colorized). However, there are exceptions. Kubrick's Dr. Strangelove would not be improved in color, and Orson Welles' Citizen Kane would not even work as well in color, partially because of the ""Movietone"" and front page photography feel that Welles wanted, but also because color would add nothing to the sharp focus on an ultimately empty icon of an entirely black and white medium. And Sir Carol Reed's The Third Man is a strongly atmospheric film that clearly is better in black and white. It might be said that if there isn't enough light, it is false to pretend to color. Flowers that bloom at night are usually white.It's Vienna, in a winter month, just after WWII. The city is still in ruins and rubble, still occupied by Allied troops. There is a forlorn sense of loss and waste hanging in the air like a dark blanket of gloom, and the citizens still suffer from a shortage of consumer goods and basic medicines; a good part of the economy is still driven by the black market. Spring and a colorful rejuvenation seem remote. And so the sharp black and white Oscar-winning cinematography of Robert Krasker, imaginative and deeply evocative of a great city in darkness, was perfect. From the ornate facades of old buildings to the wet catacombs of the sewers to the suddenly illuminated face of a slyly smirking Orson Welles, the camera carries the story driven by the zither theme, played over and over again, sometimes loud and insistent, sometimes soft and yielding, commenting all the while like an ironic jester.But The Third Man is more than brilliant cinematography set to a haunting melody. The well-chosen cast, led by Joseph Cotton as an urban American who writes pulp Westerns, and Alida Valli (who followed this performance with a long career in the Italian cinema) as the misplaced Anna Schmidt, and Trevor Howard as British Major Calloway, and of course Orson Welles as the dark and mysterious Harry Lime, was excellent all around. The script by Graham Greene from his novel of the same name is intelligent and compelling. The editing and direction by Reed paced the story nicely, neither too sharply cut nor too drawn out because this is a film that demands both quick action sequences and moments of mirthless pause for mood and reflection.This is a great film because almost everything was done right. The result is a work of art that invades and sets up permanent residence in our psyches. I saw this for the first time as a boy many years ago and it remained in my memory as the most mysterious and eerie movie I had ever seen. Seeing it again in the twenty-first century only confirms the experience of that small boy.This is included in the film noir canon, and indeed it represents itself well there. But The Third Man is better understood as a film of stark realism as well as a mystery in the tradition of an older genre that accepts the common standards of human decency as right and correct (as Catholic Graham Greene believed them) and does not give way to amorality or the success of evil. Harry Lime is a man of charm and character, of intelligence and worldly wiles, but he is also a man with a sociopathic personality and a callous disregard for human life other than his own. It is giving away nothing to realize that such a man in Greene's world, in the world of the mystery story--like something from Agatha Christie, perhaps--will not succeed in the end. But what actually does transpire in the end, indelibly marked by the final shot of Anna walking directly in the middle of the road between two matching lines of cold, leafless trees, is from the school of realism, a realism born of nearly a century of intermittent war and recurrent human tragedy for Vienna, for Austria, for most of Europe. There is in this film no compromise with that truth.See this for Orson Welles, the 25-year-old wunderkind director and star of Citizen Kane (1941), here in his early thirties, enjoying the supreme compliment of starring in a film in which are employed, in frank imitation of his work in Citizen Kane, some of his original cinematic techniques.(Note: Over 500 of my movie reviews are now available in my book ""Cut to the Chaise Lounge or I Can't Believe I Swallowed the Remote!"" Get it at Amazon!)"
cagebox111,"Jul 12, 2021",7/10,"The Third Man is a widely revered and loved classic that holds up today. I won't say I loved the movie. It was a little too slow paced and lacked the excitement of some of my favorite film noirs I have watched, but I must say Orson Welles is fantastic in his limited role. I had always thought of Orson Welles more as a great director than a great actor, but here his presence looms large and his Cuckoo clock speech is one of the best in all of cinema. The score in this movie is also fantastic and memorable."
MacAindrais,"Aug 12, 2007",10/10,"The Third Man (1949) ****Carol Reed and Graham Greene's 'The Third Man' is regarded as one of the greatest and most entertaining films ever made, and I would not for a second disagree. The Third Man contains a quality that is uniquely rare in film: it embodies all that is magnificent about going to the movies. I was not born when this film was made and released. Nor were my parents for another 3 years. Yet the film transcends its age and retains such a great story, and for that it is nearly impossible for anyone to dislike. I love the film. I have since I first saw it, and I've only grown fonder of it as the years pass. I waited for a while to purchase a DVD, as I knew that it was going to be re-released on Criterion. And now, I'm proud to say that I finally own the new 2-disc edition, and very pleased to report that it is one of the best purchases I've ever made.The film follows the lost and lonely Holly Martins as he searches post-war Vienna for clues about the death of his friend and supposed-to-be business associate, Harry Lime. He arrives in Vienna on the day of Lime's funeral. There he meets Inspector Calloway who offers him a drive back to town, and then explains that Lime was involved in the underground diluted penicillin ring, which caused the deaths of many. Martins, an unemployed pulp novelist, dedicates himself to finding out the truth and clearing his friends name, only to find out perhaps that Calloway is right, and that perhaps Harry Lime may not be dead after all. His journey takes him through shadowy Vienna and introduces him to shadowy friends of Lime and his girlfriend. Martin's falls in love with her, but her love for Harry is eternal, and perhaps even fatalistic.The Third Man contains three key elements which makes it so perfect. First, is the razor sharp dialogue by Graham Greene; second, is Reed's brilliant direction and ingenious shot angles and shadows; third, is the extraordinary zither score. Many then, and even today, find the score perplexing and distracting. But to take it away and The Third Man would lose one of its most important aspects. It manages to be cheerful but not jokey or light. Its ironic tones bring a heavy sense of disillusionment that fits perfectly with the narrative of the film. Robert Krasker's cinematography also presents the film with a disillusioning effect. Many shots are filmed at a tilted angle which throws off the equilibrium of the shots and presents a window into the confusion and upheaval of Martins' world.The story is typical of a thriller, but not really typical at all. The entrance of the films biggest star and plot mechanism doesn't even make his entrance until over half way through the film, but his entrance is one of the greatest, and most infamous of all movie entrances. He also delivers the greatest adlib in the history of the movies, the famous 'cuckoo clock' speech. The eventual and inevitable doomed final act culminates in one of the great movie chases. It's not fast and furious like a car chase in Bullitt, but it is slow, meticulous and intelligent like the brilliant metro chase in Melville's 'Le Samourai.' The fatal game of hide and seek is beautifully shot in bleak and shadowy cinematography and rife with the hollow sounds of footsteps, no music.The Third Man is one of my all time favorite films. It's as entertaining as any movie, and totally re-watchable. I've seen it at least 10 times so far, and will see it certainly many more than ten times. The Third Man embodies all that is joyful about going to the movies.4/4"
LeonLouisRicci,"Jun 30, 2014",7/10,"A Stunning, Atmospheric Film to look at with Dialog that Crackles and is Universally Considered one of the Best Films of all time. The Setting is Post War Vienna and the City's Landscape with Huge Sculptures and Bombed Out Buildings was Ripe for the Filming and Film it They did from Every Conceivable Angle and with Extreme Lighting Flourishes that make this a Favorite Among Film-Noir Fans.But there are Three Things in this Movie that are Intensely Irritating. So much so that it Balances all the Great Stuff, but Honestly and Objectively, make this only Above Average and a Very Different Film.The Music...Nothing but Oddball Zither and near Two Hours of it might have You Screaming in Pain or at the very Least Turning the Sound Off.The Woman...Constantly Moping about and Pining for Harry just gets Sad and Boring with Her relentless Drooping Demeanor and Praising the ""God-Like"" Lime. Her strong Rejection of Holly Martins in Virtually Every Scene as he Pants after Her like a Dog in Heat is just Embarrassing.The Foreign Language Without Subtitles...Unattractive People Speaking Non-English all the time that goes Undeciphered because it is not Subtitled is a Distraction that Demands the Highest of Tolerance. The Elderly Woman Wrapped in the Blanket Takes the Cake.Overall the Good Outweighs the Bad and it is a Film that is Essential Viewing for Anyone but the most Aloof Movie Goer because it is Rated so High and it is a Visual Treat and the Dialog (that is in English) can be Intriguing and Amusing. If You can Tolerate the Three Irritants above it can be Considered a Fine Film."
bigal-43,"Jun 30, 2006",8/10,"Brilliant b/w cinematography. No wonder it won the Oscar for 1951 and several other industry awards. There is still a place for b/w if it can reach the standards set by this film.Orson Welles proves he is a very good actor as well as his other contributions to the film industry. Trevor Howard's portrayal of the cool determined British officer is superb. Joseph Cotten underplays the difficult role of the western thriller writer caught in a situation way out of his depth.The mysterious Valli leaves us somewhat frustrated by her refusal to escape the clutches of the Russian authorities for the sake of a man who thinks nothing of making money from the misery of helpless children and adults with his contaminated penicillin. It begs the eternal question: ""Why do beautiful women fall for evil men?"

MarieGabrielle,"Mar 14, 2009",10/10,"This film is based on the acclaimed novel by Graham Green. It has all the elements of psychological suspense, odd characters and various politics of the black market and what it was like in the French, German, Russian and Austrian section right after World War II.Welles is superb as villain Harry Lime. An opportunist, he sells penicillin on the black market of Vienna, which he is able to rationalize. Joseph Cotten, an old friend from the U.S. visits Harry Lime, but is informed of his untimely death.There are many twists and turns and Trevor Howard is very good in the role of Inspector Holloway ...""English, not Irish""... he tells Cotten, as the ways of post-war Eurpe are made evident, many regional distinctions, and daily uncertainties.The cinematography of Vienna and the crumbling buildings, most notably the conditions in which Fraulein Schmidt (well-portrayed by Alida Valli) reflects the harsh reality of the war. The wood furnace in her ruined flat is almost symbolic of the starkness and hardship which existed in post-war Europe. Highly recommended. 10/10."
NateW,"Oct 4, 2001",10/10,"If one movie could be described as 'hip' or 'far out', this would be it. A first rate example of it's genre, it's a sheer delight from start to finish. Everything is here: international intrigue, a seductive romantic interest, a suspicious supporting cast, a sewer chase, and of course, Orson Welles as one of the most corruptable villains in cinematic history. And to top it all off, behind it all is the most unique and enjoyable music score this side of Star Wars. Words fail to describe the awesomeness possessed here, but don't worry about that. Just sit back and enjoy top notch film noir that's sure to put a smile on your face."
kurosawakira,"Feb 27, 2013",7/10,"I'm not partial to the practice of categorizing films in genres because it seems to be, in essence, a practice of subjectivity masquerading as objectivity that dictates to the viewer what kind film one is seeing, or how one should react to it. This, I believe, is because each ""genre"" then associates with a myriad of preconceived genre-specific types, clichés, memes and expectations that guide our perception of the film.But film noir I see altogether differently. Not necessarily a film genre but more akin to a philosophy of film, it's a superbly entertaining framework and subject to think of. Not a unified, unilateral type at all, the films still bear some resemblance in their visual look (chiaroscuro, low angle/Dutch angle, etc.) and narrative devices (a well-intentioned, unknowing character is thrown in the middle of an impossible scheme in a hostile universe). The audience rarely know any better, and we are there, stumbling, obliging, led on by clues, trying to find our way just as the main character is. The best noir, then, is not about things happening to the main character but to us.The best parts of the film are the exterior chases, and of course the grand finale. The film unfolds slowly, but the last third is fireworks. The Ferris Wheel is a brilliant example of real characters conversing with each other – interrupting each other, fighting for their space in their conversation. Welles is the master of this kind of dialogue. Here he's at the top of his game. And his expressions, just marvellous!""Mr. Arkadin"" (1955) is similar. There, too, we have a man behind the curtain (Welles) whose real identity is investigated and seemingly revealed, yet Welles ups the ante there, and although it comes down to us in butchered form, it's still an utterly accomplished work. These two films really compliment each other, even if I prefer Welles'."
JFCole,"Feb 10, 2004",10/10,"I bought this film after watching Citizen Kane for the first time, purely in order to see more of Orson Welles' acting (a fair enough reason, I think!) I hadn't really paid attention to anything else, so when Joseph Cotton appeared on screen, I was surprised but pleased, mainly because I recognised him from Citizen Kane as well. Over the next 100 mins or so he went on to prove himself one of the best screen actors I've ever seen, easily comparable with his co-stars: it's fair to say that Orson Welles dominates the film, but arguably Joseph Cotton dominates the screen. Add in to this Trevor Howard, an often overlooked but talented actor, and Valli, who is captivatingly melancholic, plus the absolutely brilliant final sequence, and you end up watching a great, great film. It's just a shame that the finest British film ever made dates back to 1949: couldn't we have gone on to even better things? To be honest, who cares: just sit down and watch this!"
jimbo-53-186511,"Aug 26, 2023",6/10,"Novelist Holly Martins makes the journey to post-war Vienna. Upon arrival he learns that his friend Harry Lime has died under bizarre circumstances. As Martins begins investigating his friend's death, he starts to hear conflicting stories on how his friend died and when he is lead to believe that a mysterious third man is involved he starts to suspect that Lime may have been murdered...I'm always up for watching an old classic film and spotting this film advertised on BBC2 this morning I decided to record it and watched it this evening. Here's my take on it...With The Third Man what you essentially have is a fairly decent story that is relatively intriguing and yet for me there was still something missing here. It's one of those talky films which is fine if there is something else to back up all the chatter, but for me, the film lacked something in the way of pzazz and firepower. Even though the investigative side of the story is quite interesting the film is quite slow and I also found the score intrusive and over-used. Even from a technical perspective the film is on shaky ground; the editing and continuity for example are some of the worst that I've seen on cinema (though these things could be slightly forgivable given the age of the film).The acting is acceptable but I didn't really feel that anyone truly shined here; again the presence of Orson Welles seems to increase the hype surrounding this film and whilst he is by no means bad here I fail to see why he is anymore worthy than many of the other good actors and actresses that populated this film.I liked some of director Carol Reed's touches in this film; his dark and dingy Vienna (with many scenes being filmed in London) does give the film a classic noir feel to it and some of the establishing shots showing large silhouettes was also a nice touch.For fans of classic cinema The Third Man is definitely worth seeing as there isn't anything majorly wrong with it. However, for me to give a film a score of 7 or above it has to really involve me and have a true wow factor and/or something special about it. Sadly this film didn't quite manage to wring out that much emotion from me."
mechaileh,"Jan 28, 2022",5/10,"A confused movie, conducted with a terrible soundtrack. It's impossible to watch this movie with that soundtrack. For some reason it's considered a classic, a masterpiece. Such reason scapes me."
StanleyStrangelove,"Sep 3, 2005",10/10,"Director Carol Reed's masterpiece about Vienna after WWII. Joseph Cotten is Holly Martins an American writer of westerns who comes to Vienna to see his old friend Harry Lime (Orson Welles.) He's informed that Lime had just been run down in a strange automobile accident and is dead. In talking with people about the accident he discovers that their stories don't match. He meets Anna, Harry's girlfriend (the beautiful Alida Valli) and starts to fall for her. The British police are also quite interested in the circumstances of Lime's death and want to know more Martin's relationship with him. Maj. Calloway (Trevor Howard) calls in Martin for questioning and sends Sgt. Paine (Bernard Lee -- M from the James Bond films) to keep an eye on him. This movie is multi-leveled with the surface level story about Lime's death and underneath about what post-war Vienna was like. Director Reed won an Oscar. From a story by Graham Greene. Ranked #57 on the American Film Institute's 100 best films list."
Karl Self,"Sep 29, 2008",10/10,"This is obviously a timeless classic and one of the best movies ever. A full sixty years after its filming it still manages to keep you on the edge of your seat. Brilliant script, brilliant acting, brilliant direction, brilliant cinematography, brilliant music. And all this was shot to the bizarre backdrop of a still rubbled post-war Vienna, one of the first feature movies to be shot in Europe at that time. You can't say fairer than that, can you? I first watched this as a child when I didn't understand much about Penicillin and black-marketeering, but I easily grasped that this charming fellow Harry Lime was one of the evilest lowlives ever to have crept across this earth.What really marks this movie is its authenticity. I doubt whether many inhabitants of Casablanca would have recognised their city in Bogie's eponymous classic, but The Third Man could easily double as a socio-documentary of the city. In scenes such as the one where the little blond boy runs after protagonist Holly Martins (Joseph Cotton) gleefully exulting ""Murderer, murderer!"", Director Carol Reed readily grasped the Viennese soul and spirit, which very frequently borders on the macabre."
Scott-Antes,"Dec 26, 2005",10/10,"The Third Man is a must see, must have, for all film fans. The script, the setting, the cast, the acting, the cinematography, all are superior. I particularly like two things about the film: One is the post-WW II venue, which contributes to the story's intrigue as well as providing historical, cultural, and scenic value. Another is the fact that the story is not as predictable as the viewer might expect. Those of us who critique every film we see always will find something--however minor--to criticize, but this film is well done in every respect. It's a definite classic, one that belongs in every film buff's library. I prefer the British version to the American, just because it's the original, but either way it's hard to go wrong on The Third Man."
watkins39,"May 20, 2003",10/10,"The Third Man is a noir thriller set in postwar Vienna which tells the story of a couple of Americans trying to renew a childhood friendship in a foreign country after growing up to be very different people.  Like all of Graham Greene's fiction, the film makes themes of betrayal, the loss of innocence, and the true difficulty of forming apparently simple moral judgements.Many people count this as their favourite movie, which is remarkable for a British film of the 1940s.  It is just a very successful coming-together of many wonderful talents: Greene wrote a classic screenplay, Carol Reed's direction is inspired genius, and Orson Welles, Trevor Howard, Joseph Cotton and others contributed unforgettable performances.  Anton Karas's theme music is legendary.  The cinematography is stunning.You can become obsessed with this film, and if you do you will want to read Charles Drazin's excellent 1999 book ""In Search of the Third Man"".  I also recommend the reviews by the eminent British critic Philip French, who has much of interest to say about the sources for Greene's screenplay."
anonymous124,"Mar 12, 2006",N/A,"(part of 30 essays on what I think are the 30 greatest films of all time. They are written in no particular order) (yes, I know one of the facts supplied in this review is deliberately wrong, I put it there to preserve a great twist.) God, I love watching ""The Third Man."" I love getting excited whenever Holly Martins is getting chased down ruined post war Vienna streets, set to a ironic, mockingly cheerful Caribbean style zither music. And I love our first shot of Orson Welles, one of the greatest movie moments of all times. I love watching the chase down the sewer every time I see it, the voices echoing down a hellishly wet dungeon. I love pretending I don't know the twist that comes later on in the movie, like it was the first time I saw it. I love the moment when the camera tracks a cat down the streets onto the feet of someone in the shadows. Is it the Third Man? This is a perfect mystery, not to complicated that you wonder you missed an important detail when you decided to take a leak halfway through, or too simple that you guess immediately the twist that is coming later.It's a British production set in post war Vienna, which is in ruins, about a poor, simple writer of cheap novelettes like ""Showdown at San Antonio Flats"" named Holly Martins. (More than once he is told that he's ""quite popular here in Europe."") Martins is looking for an old friend named Harry Lime who had offered him a job from Vienna. As Martins arrives, he is informed by a neighbor that he is 10 minutes too late - Harry Lime is dead. At the funeral he meets a British police officer named Calloway (not Callahan!) who tells him that Lime was mixed up in a crime racket. Martins spends much of the movie trying to clear Lime's name, which is difficult because the witnesses have jarringly different accounts of the accident in which Lime died. I won't tell you any more of the film - in fact, don't read any other reviews of this before you see it in case you find out something - this is a great film to just let play out in front of you.The Third Man stars Joseph Cotten as Holly Martins, Alida Valli as Lime's girlfriend (who Holly inevitably falls for), Trevor Howard as Calloway, and, in a show stealing role Orson Welles, as Harry Lime, who appears entirely in flashbacks. It was directed by Carol Reed, who won his Oscar (probably undeservedly) for ""Oliver!"". The only Oscar this film won was for cinematography (that is definitely this films award).Just try and see The Third Man and not love it like I did. I dare you."
glgioia,"Sep 13, 2002",10/10,"One of the finer films ever made. Masterful direction and screenplay set against a dreary but romantic postwar Austria. Even if you dont dig film noir, you will enjoy this. Pop it in the VCR sometime after midnight and soak it in baby."
oppaimauspad,"May 30, 2022",7/10,The Third Man is an extremely overrated film. The only reason critics and curators like it is because Orson Wells gives a monologue about how he views people as ants and wouldn't mind squashing a few of them.
kuringai-1,"Mar 14, 2006",10/10,"The Third Man- the greatest film-noir, and the greatest British film.Alcoholic pulp fiction author Holly Martins travels to Vienna looking for a job from college chum Harry Lime... only to learn that he is dead.According to one witness, three men carried off his body after it was hit by a truck- but Martins can only find two of them, and goes off searching for the third man for the first two thirds.You've probably already guessed who the third man is- if not, then I won't spoil it for you. However, it is not the story that makes The Third Man the classic it is (although it helps): it is the moody atmosphere, the use of shadows and the pure fun that can be found in this, greatest of English films.Oh, and don't worry about it being ""boring""- it moves a the cracking pace of an Indianna Jones movie."
asayed-63121,"Aug 7, 2023",7/10,"The Third Man is regarded as one of the best mystery movies, So I decided to give it a go. And I found out that the hype was well-deserved.The script and screenplay of the film is very-engaging to say the least. I was hooked on to the event unfolding before my screen. It also has a lot of memorable quotes.The acting performances were memorable, and all actors brought their A-game. You would find yourselves sympathizing with Anna, played beautifully by Alida Valli.The movie has a feeling of 'German Expressionism' with all its lighting and mystery. The dark lights, the reveal of faces, the cemetary.I had a bone to pick with the score of the film. I dont know wheter it is my gen-z mind. But the background score sounded something I would find in a sitcom or a comedy, instead of a mystery."
Craigangeone,"Nov 20, 2007",10/10,"An American Pulp Fiction Novelist (Cotten) arrives in post World War II Vienna to accept a job offer from his old friend Harry Lime (Welles) and discovers that he has been killed in a mysterious accident.....and thus begins this superb film-noir. Graham Greene's screenplay (based upon his earlier novella of the same name) is majestically given life on the big screen by Director Carol Reed. What ensues is a remarkable blend of witty dialogue, clever chase sequences and possibly the greatest character entrance in the history of film. The amazing cinematography blends consummately with the haunting Zither theme music of Anton Karas, to create an eerily authentic Viennese street atmosphere.The trio of actors; namely Valli, Welles and Howard turn in thoroughly convincing performances in their respective roles. However, the standout performance of the film is supplied by Joseph Cotten; one finds that he is so often underrated in the history of film. Nonetheless, he is wonderful as Holly Martins; a character that is thrust into a role as a drunken, and at times seemingly incompetent, amateur detective.This is a film that builds a strong case to be considered the greatest English language film of all time, especially when one considers the manner in which it is able to combine the elements of superb characterization, expressionist style and suspenseful drama."
Andy44,"Aug 26, 2002",10/10,"I envy anyone seeing this for the first time; I was young when I first saw it and was quite entertained, but couldn't get the most out of it.Now I've watched it many times and realize the masterful integration of plot, setting, characters, sound, scene, pace, etc. that make it a great flick.The Criterion DVD is very nice (should be, at that price), especially the original Graham Greene story and his comments."
bachemar,"Jul 24, 2006",10/10,"I just finished watching this movie on TCM and what can I say...I loved it! Very funny, though dark and Harry Lime deserved everything he got! Very well acted and amazing cinematography led to a very enjoyable experience. The plot, in my opinion, was simple but well written. The twists and turns were easy to follow, but not at all dull. Although it did help to know German when the ""native Austrians"" were talking, but English speakers don't stay away. The only thing I didn't like was how the female lead turned out, I couldn't believe her reactions in the end. Still, it is worth a look! Both my dad (64) and I (22) both got a lot of laughs out of this one."
Pamsanalyst,"Sep 28, 2004",10/10,"The Viennese speak German, and not accented English, except for the scene where the conspirator places a phone call. That is our first clue; Popescu [is it him? my memory plays tricks] speaks English to arrange a meeting. He must be speaking to Lime, and when we see the men on the bridge in the distance, there are FOUR of them.The little boy and his moon face speak pure terror: and a child shall lead them to point out Martins as the suspected murderer.The henchmen chase Martins up the cylindrical staircase; he jumps into the first port in the storm, only to be bitten by a parrot. This is pure genius.The shadow of the man who approaches the cafe: ""Balloon?"" What he is doing there at that time of night, we cannot understand. Perhaps he is going home.Lime slyly opening the door to the Ferris wheel compartment, and those just-right Chocolate ladies in the Casanova Club.For another take on this film, read Philip Kerr's Berlin Requiem, where its making is a bit player in the hunt for Gestapo Muller."
