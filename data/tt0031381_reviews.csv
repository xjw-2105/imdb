paskuniag-584-890551,"Nov 20, 2017",9/10,"I've seen the film many times, have always enjoyed it. But I've been reading the book for the first time. It's a very long novel, and you have to stay with it if you want to see the ending. It's a good read, but Margaret Mitchell, former newspaper reporter, is very thorough in her description of both Southern culture and the changes that the Civil War brought to it. It's the size of the book that was the biggest challenge for David O Selznick. Not what parts to film, but which parts to leave out. So many characters that appeared in the book couldn't be introduced in the movie without extending the film's length to well over four hours. So he had Sidney Howard write the screenplay, then cut that down to a filmable length by hiring several more writers to further pare the script, and was still rewriting it himself while it was being filmed. Selznick was close to running out of money, so he asked his angel, millionaire Jock Whitney, to loan him enough to finish the film. The film was finally completed and edited, then was test-marketed at a theatre not far from LA. The viewers were excited about having seen it and said so on their preview cards, which allowed Selznick to rest easy, knowing he had a hit on his hands."
PCC0921,"Mar 30, 2022",9/10,"The year 1939 was a busy year for the Hollywood industry. Large-scale, majestic epics were front and center that year. You should look up the list of films released in 1939. It was a very, busy year, with huge titles from the golden age. Lots and lots of entertainment for a pre-WW2 audience. The Wizard of Oz (1939), Stagecoach (1939), Son of Frankenstein (1939), Drums Along the Mohawk (1939) and this little film, are just some of the titles on that list. Everyone was competing for perfection in the film industry. The first two hurtles, being sound and color film, had been implemented into the technical side of the filmmaking process, to this point in film history. Technicolor had been utilized for, about, five years to this point and it was perfectly utilized in this film too. Technicolor always was a good film stock, rich with colors, that pop on the screen. Head cinematographer, Ernest Haller's camera, captures images, not seen before on film and blazes colors across the screen, in Gone With the Wind (1939).I'm sure everyone knows the basic premise of the film. It boils down to a story about the life of woman, a daughter of a rich cotton plantation owner in 1860s, Georgia, who's life interweaves with the real life events of the American Civil War and the recovery and reconstruction years. It is a fictitious story utilizing events from the real world. Of course, most of us remember the picture on the movie posters of Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) and Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), locked in that emotional, romantic embrace, plus it's on the cover of every DVD and Blu-Ray out there these days, but the film is really about Scarlett and all the other characters come into her circle. And, the film needs to be about Scarlett in order to be successful, because it is her spoiled, selfish, smug demeanor that energizes the whole film. Everyone who comes into her circle feels her wrath, even Rhett. Rhett isn't really a very likeable character either and watching these two unlikeable characters square off, through various parts of this film, is something to see. These are the reasons, that make this film so good. A plot involving two unlikeable characters, who eventually, reach a certain amount of maturity, that they earn some respect from the audience, doesn't deter from the overall quality of the film, because it is such a unique character study, while chaos is happening all around them.The film does contain many sub-plots, involving politically, socially, culturally and racially charged tones, which would be expected, considering the time this period piece takes place. Which, brings up another interesting point to this film. Even though this film is approaching 85 years old now in the 21st century, it is still considered a period piece. The interesting part is the filmmakers had a more recent memory of the events used in the film, being only 75 years before, as opposed to our view, which is roughly 150 years later. In fact, there probably were a couple of Civil War veterans still alive in 1939. Another amazing thing about this film is, they started shooting this thing in January, 1939 and released it just before Christmas that same year. That is impressive, considering the massive runtime of this film. It is the runtime of this film that really hurts it from being a perfect film.The images the filmmakers (I would list names, but you should see the Crew List on this film), are able to show us on the screen, is incredible. The color you will have stuck in your head, for a week after viewing this film, will be the color of orange, red fire, that is seen throughout the movie and obviously, mostly comes from the burning of Atlanta. A technical achievement, that hadn't been seen in the movies yet. The special effects, art direction, costuming and lighting is fantastic. You still don't notice, even today, that most of this movie was just filmed, out in the Los Angeles countryside and on sound stages. So much is going on in this film, you don't notice it. The performances by the cast is perfect. This is an epic journey about redemption and maturing. A maturity that helps the characters and a nation begin to grow. This film would roll through the Oscars in 1940, including winning the Best Picture Oscar.9.3 (A MyGrade) = 9 IMDB."
daisukereds,"Nov 10, 2019",8/10,"I wish people made more movies like this nowadays..Yes! The movie is LONG, but the development of the main character has you swinging from liking her to hating her, to agreeing with her, to.. all sort of emotions!! It is well worth anyone's time.
These characters feel SO real! It's like a perfect summarized soap opera. Anyone studying movie-writing should check this adaptation of the book. Would recommend to anyone.And make yourself a favor and don't watch the sequel.. the movie ends the way it does for a reason."
IshtiaqAhmed,"Dec 15, 2019",10/10,"This movie was on my watch list since 1996 or 1997 when I read its review in a local newspaper. I though it must be a dull movie as it is very old and procrastinated to watch until Dec 2019.And friends, I can't tell you how much I am impressed with this movie - wonderful story, superb acting, mesmerizing cinematography and direction. And they did it in 1939 - which is really hard to digest.I am stupid enough to miss this glory for so many years."
Turanic,"Jun 12, 2020",10/10,"At first you would think, the main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background...
Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love... She has a target she want to achieve and she thinks if she achieves it she will be happy, while missing the point on the way to that target... Something that I realised on a 2nd viewing is that Scarlet is a pretty selfish person with sociopaths behaviour. She can easily manipulate men and sometimes women in order to achieve her goal. She can kill a person and not feel that bad about it,she can exploit prisoners rather than hire free men. The goal is what pushes her forward and sometimes makes her do good things, but these deeds are never done out of big heart, they are usually done in self interest. You would think she ends up achieving everything she wanted, but she does not. Scarlet lives in a personal hell which partially she created herself and only when the last obstacle to her big love, the female friend that loves her is gone, she realises that all this time, she lived the illusion of love, she was hurting the people that loved her. Is scarlet a horrible person? Probably... Does she pay for her sins? She does more than anyone... Does she understand what true love is? Yes in the end she does... What makes this film so great, it's a tragedy like ""War And Peace"" with monumental character development ...Any scenes of war and racism fade compared to the tragedy of Scarlet which lives in personal hell..."
planktonrules,"Aug 5, 2006",10/10,"I've done so many reviews on IMDb and despite this, I can't believe I never reviewed this super-famous film. Well, much if this is because with so many reviews, I truly doubt if anyone will ever read this! I was surprised that when I perused the reviews, there were quite a few knuckleheads that gave the film a score of one!! While I do agree that the film is rather dated in the way it deals with minorities, it is truly insane to trash a film just because it offends your easily damaged sensibilities. One person even compared the film to PLAN 9! Come on, folks,...this is an amazing film. And what makes it even more amazing is that the film had several different directors because producer Selznick was so difficult to work with on this film! And, despite this, the film wins (among many other awards), the BEST DIRECTOR Oscar! While I do think that many Oscars should have been earned, giving it to just one man seemed pretty cheeky! Despite this, this is a magnificent sweeping spectacle about the South--but even more about a selfish beauty who ultimately creates chaos of her decent life. Magnificent, well-acted and memorable--this is one of the greatest films of all time."
jotix100,"Feb 22, 2005",10/10,"This film shows the best of the American cinema. Whether we like the film, or not, one has to recognize the greatest achievement, perhaps, of the creative talent of the people working in the movie industry. ""Gone with the Wind"" represents a monumental leap, as well as a departure, for the movies, as they were done prior to this film.The vision of David O. Selznick, the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation came into being, despite the different opinions from the two stubborn factions in the war.""Gone with the Wind"" brought together the best people in Hollywood. The end result is the stunning film that for about four hours keep us interested in the story unfolding in the screen. Of course, credit must be due to the director, Victor Fleming, and his vision, as well as the adaptation by Sydney Howard, who gave the right tone to the film. The gorgeous cinematography created by Ernest Haller gives us a vision of the gentle South before the war, and the Phoenix raising from the ashes of a burned Atlanta. The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie.One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. Ms. Leigh was at the best moment of her distinguished career and it shows. Scarlett goes from riches to rags, back to riches again and in the process finds an inner strength she didn't know she possessed. Her impossible love for Ashley will consume her and will keep her away from returning the love to the man that really loves her, Rhett.The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency. His love for Scarlett, the woman he knows is in love with a dream, speaks eloquently for itself.The other two principals, Olivia de Havilland and Leslie Howard, give performances that are amazing to watch. Ms. de Havilland's Melanie Hamilton is perfect. Melanie is loyal to the woman that does everything to undermine her marriage to Ashley. Mr. Howard's Ashley gives a perfect balance to the man in love with his wife, while Scarlett keeps tempting him.The rest of the cast is too numerous to make justice to all the actors one sees on the screen, but omitting the contribution of Hattie McDaniel to the film would be sinful. Ms. McDaniel was such a natural actress that she is excellent no matter in what movie she is playing. This huge talent is a joy to watch.Comments to this forum express their objections to the way the race relations play in the movie, but being realistic, this movie speaks about the not too distant past where all kinds of atrocities, such as the slavery, were the norm of the land. While those things are repugnant to acknowledge, in the film, they are kept at a minimum. After all, this film is based on a book by one of the daughters of that South, Margaret Mitchell, who is presenting the story as she saw it in her mind, no doubt told to her from relatives that lived in that period of a horrible page in the American history.Enjoy this monumental classic in all its splendor."
jamesjustice-92,"Apr 28, 2022",10/10,"It was way back on New Year's day of 2014 when I got myself a copy of this movie and watched it for the first time, in total awe; that one hadn't got an overture, intermission and exit music and ran at about 3,5 hours but I didn't feel the time at all. What's 4 hours of time when the story is timeless?What can I tell you about the movie that you don't already know? That it is the highest grossing movie of all times? That it got eight Oscars including the first ever given to an African-American, Hattie McDaniel (whose Mammy was an adorable character and I'm totally in love with her performance)? Or that I love this movie to the moon and back? Yes, that's what I'm going to say.This 1939's masterpiece is a perfection of a movie and frankly my dears I don't give a damn about what you have to say about it. Excellent performances (especially by Clark Gable and Hattie McDaniel) and lovable characters, impressive war and hospital scenes, plot and storylines that leave you fidgeting on the edge of the seat until the end, beautiful music, astounding cinematography, colorful set pieces, splendid direction by Victor Fleming and the list goes on and on. It's easier to say bad things about the movie because there are none.Sometimes we all feel like Scarlett: that we are living a lie, believing the things that are untrue, making other people miserable and thinking there's no one out there who truly loves us the way we are but missing it all because of the blindfold on our eyes. But once we take it off everything changes. You change. I change. And I hope every new day will bring positive changes for all of us because after all tomorrow is another day..."
murtaza_mma,"Jul 8, 2011",10/10,"Margaret Mitchell's Gone with the Wind, in its true essence, is a case study on the Old American way of living where pride and honor were the very essence of human existence. Victor Fleming's rendition of the classic novel, a classic within its own right, does full justice to the themes propagated by Mitchell's evocative masterpiece. In the words of Mitchell herself, Gone with the Wind is the story of the people whose gift of gumption gave them a definitive edge to endure the tribulation and throes of the American Civil War vis-à-vis those who lacked an inner resolve and determination needed for survival.Scarlet O'Hara, the well bred, haughty, tempestuous and opportunistic protagonist of the saga, is an ostensibly flawed individual whose inexorable urge to placate her ego and realize her fancies appears far stronger than her adherence to any credence pious to her people and relevant to her time. Her scintillating charm and unrestrained zeal not only make her an object of desire for her male counterparts but also an object of envy for the girls around her.Vivian Leigh perfectly fits into the caricature of Scarlet O'Hara. She makes full use of her talent, courage and guile to portray a part that requires subtlety, brusqueness and poise in equal parts. It may sound like a hyperbole, but no other actress seemed better equipped to play the part a southern belle than Leigh herself, who won not one but two Oscars while playing one: first for her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara and second for portraying Blanche DuBois in A Streetcar Named Desire opposite Marlon Brando. In fact, her portrayal of Scarlet O'Hara, in which she perfectly blends panache, poignancy and peremptoriness, is arguably the greatest portrayal by a female lead in cinematic history. Leigh uses her on-stage experience to improvise in order to add new dimensions and complexities to Scarlet's caricature, which according to the novel was mostly one dimensional: out-and-out bad. Scarlet's stubbornness and her impish obsession for a conformist like Ashley, who is not only indifferent to her feelings but also incapable of reciprocating the passion and zeal with which she pursues him, represent just one dimension of her multifaceted self, which is revealed layer by layer with the progression of the narrative. The viewer is gifted to see Scarlet in various avatars: a usurper, an egomaniac, a damsel, a nemesis, a menace, a guardian, a savior, a patriot, a fighter and most importantly as a quintessence of womanhood.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler perfectly complements Vivian Leigh's larger than life portrayal. He is an outright reprobate, an unscrupulous opportunist whose life revolves around making money and pursuing carnal pleasures. However, behind this facade, just like Scarlet, there is a human capable of love, and worthy of being loved. These unobtrusive yet obvious similarities make Scarlet and Rhett a perfect match for each other. The subtle chemistry and tension between the two protagonists give the story its impetus and resonant charm. The rest of the cast has given exemplary performances with a special mention of Olivia de Havilland, who as Melanie is a paragon of love, humility and forgiveness. She provides a striking contrast to Scarlet's caricature and represents a more traditional picture of womanhood.The movie's direction, cinematography, editing and music are all top notch and it is the great synergy of all these elements that makes the movie an extravaganza and an undisputed master piece, one to be savored till eternity. The movie is an amalgam of scenes, high on emotion and drama, which keeps the viewer absorbed throughout. The scene in which Scarlet's father tells her the importance of mother land, deeming it as the only thing worth fighting for, is pure gold. Other scenes that come close to matching its brilliance include the one in which Scarlet performs the duties of an obstetrician to help Melanie give birth to her child, and the one in which Scarlet pledges to protect Tara till her last breath. The movie also has an amazing repertoire of dialogs that are delivered with a nice mix of finesse and accuracy. Butler's famous dialog in which he says to Scarlet, ""You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how,"" also happens to be one of all time favorite.The movie, especially its anti-climatic ending, brings tears to eyes and leaves the viewer overwhelmed as he experiences a rainbow of different emotions, being awestruck by the tremendous impact of the journey that he is vicariously made to undergo.PS. Gone with the Wind is undoubtedly one of cinema's greatest marvels and is a living testament to cinema's timelessness, and its limitless potential. A must watch for everyone. 10/10http://www.apotpourriofvestiges.com/"
malmevik77,"Apr 8, 2024",7/10,"Gone With the Wind (85th Anniversary Special)Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel, Gone With the Wind, was so popular when published, that it was quickly released as a 4 hour epic film in 1939, even after production delays. 85 years later, Fathom Events released it to theaters for a special engagement and I was fortunate enough to attend a screening. More time has passed since the movie came out, than the time between the end of the war and the movie (74 years).What makes this story horrible is what is not told. If you are going to tell a story of ""nostalgia"" for a different time, when prosperity and high society were the norm, then the cost of such fantasy must be laid bare. The few black characters in the story are either dimwitted, prone to hysterics, or the wise old Mammy that knows her place. Prosperity came from the horrible treatment of slaves justified as it was for their own protection due to their inferiority or childlike ignorance. None of this is shown in the film, and it is no wonder white people in 1939 declared the film a triumph.Regarding the main white-washed story, the themes are not what, I believe, the filmmakers intended. Selfishness, arrogance, ruthlessness, jealousy, rudeness, schadenfreude, and willful ignorance abound. Is this the Old South that people miss? Really?The horrors of war are not to be understated, and they are very much not. The war comes through Atlanta, burning its way to the sea, just as history tells it, leaving behind a horrible wake of wounded, death and grieving families. It is so hard to watch and imagine what it was like in that time period where there were simply no resources to help the people in need. The famous scene where the camera pans back to show the hundreds if not thousands of dead and wounded in the street makes me cry every time.However, we have our main character, Katie Scarlett O'Hara, the eldest daughter of a wealthy Irish immigrant, who is as selfish as they come. She strings along suitors only to pine after one, Ashley Wilkes, who is now unavailable as he is to be wed to Melanie Hamilton. There is a well shot scene where Scarlett wanders sullen through the crowd at a party, not noticing that war has been declared. There is no concern of men's lives, only her own petulance at being turned away. That evening she impulsively agrees to marry Melanie's brother Charles just to spite Ashley. What? When Charles dies in the war, all Scarlett cares about is a good time and dancing, which widows aren't to do. She doesn't give Charles a second though.Our second main character, Rhett Butler, is also introduced at the same party. He has the good sense to issue a warning to the men (boys) that their lifestyle of sloth, funded by the slaves beneath their notice, show an arrogance that will be their undoing. They are untrained and outgunned. But, Rhett is no saint himself, making money when it benefits only him, including blockade running. He sees something in Scarlett that mirrors his own unsavory character, and is intrigued.The real tragedy in the love story is poor Melanie. She, whether naively or intentionally, never knew about Scarlett's pursuit of Ashley. She is always by Scarlett's side, treating her like a sister, and always vouching for her character, never seeing the true Scarlett.A real hero comes in the form of a prostitute, Belle Watling. She donates to the cause, even though the source of the funds is looked down upon by continued arrogance. She hides people so they aren't hanged. Melanie tells her to her face how good of a person she is. She serves as a metaphor that the caste system is seriously flawed, and a person's purpose need not be defined by someone else.I feel that Scarlett was written as a metaphor for how the Old South truly was, while the daydreams of garden parties and dancing swirl around her. Selfishness, lack of empathy, blind to struggles except her own, lusting for something that could never be, blaming others for her problems and then disdain for those that brought defeat paint a more accurate picture. Are we supposed to cheer her on when she vows that she will continue her selfish pursuits because tomorrow is another day? After Ashley finally becomes available, and Rhett no longer is, that's the exact moment she realizes she never loved Ashley? She always wants something she can't have, even if she already has it.Why do I love this movie? Observing the historical accuracy as subtlety in the background, even when surrounded by gross inaccuracies and racial stereotypes in the foreground. Seeing the horrors of war without actually witnessing any battles. Watching each character stay stuck in the past, while the world changes in the background. The chapters of the past closing through the forms of Melanie and Rhett. And Mammy's side-eye. Boy do I love that.This is not a love story. This is a farewell, and frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn what you do next."
Alexis_Ray,"Nov 15, 2003",10/10,"The setting is a Georgia plantation. The year is 1861, and sixteen-year-old Scarlett O'Hara is infatuated with the blond, drowsy-eyed Ashley Wilkes - the problem is, Ashley plans to marry another woman. Little matter that every other man in the county is courting Scarlett and that a charming scoundrel named Rhett Butler is staring at her with questionable intent - she cares only for Ashley.Suddenly, the Civil War brakes out, changing the fates and fortunes of all. Scarlett, clever, manipulative, and charming, proves an adept survivor - but what will she have to do to survive? And will she ever learn whom it is that she really loves?GWTW is one of the most meticulously cast films ever; with the possible exception of Leslie Howard as Ashley (in his forties, rather old to be playing a man half that age), every role was perfectly assigned. After you watch Vivien Leigh you will be unable to imagine anyone else playing Scarlett, and Hattie McDaniel's strong, unforgettable performance as ""Mammy"" netted her an academy award (the first for an African-American actor).GWTW's backdrop is the gruesome Civil War, and in the end this film is the story a woman and a civilization (the Old South) going through a war that will not leave either of them unchanged.The cinematography is beautiful, memorable. Gone With the Wind was shot entirely in gorgeous technicolor; the scene of the fire in Atlanta required the use of all eight technicolor cameras in existence at the time.The pragmatic may think Gone with the Wind overly dramatic; the restless may find it too long; the action-stimulated, too subtle. None of this, however, detracts from the fact that GWTW retains a lasting appeal as one of the crowning cinematic achievements of the 20th century. Those who see its ending as depressing - tragic, even - perhaps miss the point - which Scarlett O'Hara makes in her very last instant with us, tear-stained eyes uplifted in a sudden, curious burst of hope beneath all the turmoil; that .. . ""After all, tomorrow is another day."" 10/10"
angel_de_tourvel,"Jan 7, 2005",8/10,"It is always in people's nature to put down great things and to nit-pick or sometimes just be plain mean. No matter what anyone says, this is utterly fantastic: in story, in special effects, in casting (with perhaps the sad exception of Leslie Howard as ""Ashley"") and in captivation. Vivien Leigh is so powerful, passionate, magnificent and beautiful that you could watch it 1000 times on that ground alone. She brings something so convincing and human to the role of the selfish, spoilt Scarlett; the character is larger than life.Leaving Vivien's astounding performance aside, this remains a sweeping unrivalled epic. Watch it. Esther's rating: 20/10"
Xstal,"Sep 29, 2020",9/10,"When a film is consistently recognised through the wisdom of the crowd, over so many years, as being great and epic and, for the duration of that film to run close to four hours - it really does suggest something a bit special. That something a bit special is a timeless story set during some of the darkest times in American history but it isn't the setting that makes this special, it's the story, the story of a cruel, selfish and manipulative opportunist performing her craft to perfection, it's the story portrayed through one of the greatest cinematic performances the world of movies has ever seen. While the leading man and the supporting cast are outstanding, you walk away from this with only one person holding and controlling your thoughts, just like the character she plays, just as she does through the whole of the picture - the incredible and sublimely talented, the beautiful and vivacious, the tempestuous hurricane of a tornado that is Vivien Leigh. Setting the bar so high it remains unparalleled, even to this day."
dhable,"Sep 27, 2006",10/10,"I believe that when one views a film, one should consider the context in which it was made.Barely 10 years after talking pictures were first created; less than that after the first full-length color feature film was created; near the end of the greatest depression this country ever experienced, and in which pretty much the only entertainment available to most was radio or the movies; David O Selznik decided to turn the biggest pot-boiler blockbuster novel into a movie.And what a movie. Stunning color, the most popular mail actor of his time, perfect music score, incredible action scenes, story line only 70 years removed from when it happened, and on, and on. Can you imagine what a store-clerk or a farmer, or a teacher experienced in that world, seeing Gone With the Wind? What was there to compare with? 1939 was a watershed year for great movies, and this one was the greatest produced. Try watching this movie as if there were no TV, no DVD's, only a few radio stations, spending maybe the second to the last quarter you owned, never having seen such a movie before, and you get what I mean. Masterful for its time, and still timeless today."
mikazuki,"Dec 13, 2000",10/10,"Every time I watch this film, and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come."
dillylamar,"Apr 25, 2020",10/10,"Gone with the Wind is a superb piece of cinema shot in a beautiful way like no other film, a great story with amazing performances all around. A film about love, perseverance, deception, and tragedy. This film captures the pure attitude and idea of the south after the civil war and during the reconstruction period. It captivates you from beginning to end."
trekhyon5,"Mar 7, 2016",7/10,"So, I've been calling myself a movie buff for ages, but it took me to get to the tender age of 23 to see one of the greatest classics in the history of cinema. I must say I was pretty impressed. The film has some outdated touches of the theatrical and romantic, but much less so than I expected. It's also interesting how the main character of Scarlett O'Hara- nicely portrayed by Leigh- is so very unsympathetic, almost an anti-hero. Still, Scarlet is a strong and interesting character who gains depth throughout the film. She goes from being a detestable manifestation of a privileged, unproductive lifestyle to an independent, even cruel persona full of determination and courage.This one was at its best when depicting the cruelty of the American civil war, when the focus of the story was less on relationships and more on the agelessly political."
Nitestik,"Nov 30, 2007",1/10,"The film claims in the opening credits to have a historian as a consultant, Wilbur G. Kurtz. And, at the time of its making, what he did sufficed as history.The Old South was claimed to be a ""pretty world,"" ""a dream remembered,"" and full of gallantry. There are innumerable problems with the film the greatest of which is racist sentiment.The portrayal of ""Mammy"" is particularly racist. Manny has no name and her entire life is invested in Scarlett's. She says the happiest day of her life is when Scarlett has her child. She is always worried about the family's reputation and lives vicariously through them. She becomes terribly upset and emotional when Rhett and Scarlett fight. Most outrageously, Mammy is seen pushing USCT soldiers aside to allow Scarlett through as if Mammy and other former slaves have no interest in their own freedom.If the portrayal of Mammy is bad, the portrayal of Prissy is even worse. Mammy is at least portrayed has having some sense whereas Prissy plays ""the simple-minded darkie"" with no courage at all. Her high pitched voice serves to emphasize her inanity.Mammy and Prissy's characters are part of a larger lie that the movie attempts to tell: the myth of the ""loyal darkies."" In the scene where Atlanta is under attack by Sherman, some black men say, ""Don't worry! We'll stop them Yankees!"" When one slave is given a watch he refuses to accept it and insists that Scarlett should keep it as if to say, ""Look! These white people were so great to us we want nothing from them!"" The film also advances the myth of benign slavery. Scarlett's father tells her to treat slaves gently, as if the only problem is a few bad masters who commit excesses. When Ashley complains of misgivings about white prison labor, he says that he kept all of his slaves well-fed and would have freed them when his father died if the war had not done so first.Finally, the film advances the myth of the evil carpetbagger. ""Carpetbaggers"" are shown to be terrible and vicious people who kick injured Confederates off the road and ride with nicely dressed black men sitting in a position of equality. One night, the white southerners ""clean out the woods to protect their women,"" which is just code for organizing the KKK and committing murder.The film is rife with faux sentiment, posturing, and social strategizing. Scarlett O'Hara is simply a terrible character. She is screaming, crying and whining. She's weak, flirtatious, boy-crazy, and hopelessly in love. She slaps Prissy and tells her she will sell her south. Scarlett is manipulative, lying, deceptive, lovesick, and obsessed with looks. And all her tribulations are emphasized by melodramatic music and foreboding weather.Even scenes which would otherwise be wonderful must be condemned because of the vicious intent behind them. The contrast of the tree, Scarlett, and her father against the setting sun is simply perfect. But, it intends to advance the myth of the idyllic Old South. After the attack on Atlanta, the camera shows the land covered with soldiers and pans back up to the Confederate flag. While expertly shot, the scene is used to evoke sympathy for the Lost Cause.This film competes with Birth of a Nation for the title of ""Most Celebrated Terrible Film of All-Time."" Gone with the Wind is less racist, but much more celebrated than Birth of a Nation. Given the two criteria, it is difficult to say which is worse. Birth of a Nation has been kicked off AFI's Top 100 Films while Gone with the Wind still sits perched at #4. Whereas films like Christmas with the Kranks are unequivocally awful, Gone with the Wind is worse. The reason being that it is much worse to be shitty and pernicious than it is to be shitty and harmless.To paraphrase a quote from Scarlett, ""As God is my witness, I will never watch this film again!"""

TheLittleSongbird,"Jun 12, 2009",10/10,"Gone With the Wind is a truly remarkable epic film. True, it is four hours long, but there are several redeeming qualities that make it an unforgettable movie experience. The cinematography is gorgeous, with a wonderful contrast of beauty (love) and ugliness (war), though the war scenes could have been a tad more developed, if that is a minor offering of a criticism. The costumes are lovely, especially Scarlett O'Hara's dresses, and the music score is phenomenal, with a sweeping unforgettable title theme, that possibly everyone in the world knows. The performances were astonishing. The beautiful Vivien Leigh gives a tour de force performance as Scarlett, a performance of vulnerability, sadness and beauty. Who can't forget her passionate outbursts ""Great Balls of Fire""? Butterfly McQueen is hilarious as Prissy, with lines such as ""I don't know nothing about birthing babies"". But topping them all, in a natural if somewhat unlikeable performance as Rhett Butler, is the wonderful underrated Clark Gable, with his iconic remarks (""Frankly my dear I don't give a damn""), hearty laugh and sneer. This film was ignored for a long time, and is now considered one of the most remarkable films ever made. 10/10 Bethany Cox."
Leofwine_draca,"Feb 1, 2013",9/10,"I was put off watching this for a long time, mainly because I mistakenly believed it to be an old-fashioned romance. Boy, was I wrong. In fact, it's a story of how two maladjusted characters come together and the volatile relationship that progresses.That's the central thrust of the tale, but there's a whole lot more to GONE WITH THE WIND than that. It's an epic reconstruction of a by-gone era, a pre-Civil War American South in which man and slave lived side by side. It's a war story featuring some hugely impressive pyrotechnic effects which must have blown cinema-goers away on first release. And it's an exploration of the darkest reaches of the human condition.The actors are fantastic. Vivian Leigh really makes something of what must have been a difficult role to play. It's especially noticeable with Olivia de Havilland starring in the traditional role of the beautiful, warm-hearted heroine, and then seeing Leigh's haunted, bitter and vengeful character appearing opposite her in contrast. I especially liked Clark Gable, who exudes charisma from every pore.The production values are immaculate, the supporting cast don't put a foot wrong, and the ultra-lengthy running time flies past thanks to the viewer's involvement in the events that unfold. Tragic, shocking, moving and heart-warming in equal measure, GONE WITH THE WIND truly is a film for the ages."
Tweetienator,"Oct 11, 2017",10/10,"A perfect epic movie with a great story and a superb playing cast and one of the biggest productions imaginable. Like Ben Hur and War and Peace a classic for all eternity.A world is going down, a new world is rising out of the ashes of the gone - melancholy, fear, the sacrifice, and hope of a whole generation fighting and suffering in the Amercian Civil War.In our troubled times, where war and terror are present almost in every corner of our world and in times where the status quo seems to be a faster and faster-going constant stream and faster-going flow, where nobody can be sure or predict what the future ahead may bring to us, a movie more relevant than most people think."
mfd591,"Jun 13, 2020",N/A,This movie is 80 years old but gets better like vintage. Cant belive how good the cinematography is. The old south sets look great. Lefties need to loosen up and enjoy this movie for the romance and drama not focus on its dark period in history.
nanturn,"Aug 2, 2009",6/10,"I'm sorry, I generally don't like this film. Expansive, epic, picturesque, an achievement for its time ... OK. A compelling story about the devastation, hardship, suffering and brutality of the Civil War, and the courage and resilience of its survivors ... OK, but credit the novel for all that.A key problem is the heroine, Scarlett O'Hara, who remains insufferably selfish and inhumane throughout this long movie. Are we supposed to admire her? I cannot. Another problem is that the film drags in many places. Too much screen time is focused on men professing love for Scarlett and Scarlett expressing her hopeless adoration for Ashley. Gosh, move on with it!Even for its time, I can't see how its flaws failed to overcome its grandeur."
IceCream-57,"Jun 7, 2024",10/10,"This is by far one of the best movies ever made in American film history. It is great in every way a film can be great. With me being a history major, particularly interested in the Civil War, this film really does it for me. The tough part of the film for many is how it starts. It starts out during a time period where slavery was legal and the plantations where plentiful in the south. People were pretty naive that were part of the privilege and the rich class. Historians have had a problem for years with the beginning half of the movie because to a extent it glorifies the life of the southern from the plantation owners to the slaves even being somewhat grateful and dependant on their owners. This film shows show this very much. But the film is more then that. It illustrates the horrors of the war. People fighting in the war and the effects it has on the families involved. So many people lose their loved ones and end up in property, forever changing the south. This is definitely a classic."
eb-77766,"Jul 28, 2020",7/10,"I watched GWTW for the first time in the late 90's. I have to admit that as teenager I was quite disappointed. This is considered one of THE movies of all time and I found it hard to enjoy for a number of reasons.The lead: Scarlett O'Hara is not a likable character. She is selfish and egocentric and just mostly annoying. Since then I have to a degree learned to enjoy a little bit her will power but the character will always remain a disappointment to me.""Edit 210810: Since writing this review I have realized that Victor Fleming wanted Scarlett to be depicted in a quite bad way since she was a Southerner. I never thought of that before and that makes sense.. It doesn't change my opinion about the movie but I understand why its lead is what she is. End edit""The acting: I know it was the melodramatic way in those days but it's just not natural. First few scenes I watched I could hardly believe it since they felt SO overplayed. Since then I have watched a lot more old movies and learned to accept it but still..Ashley: Leslie Howard was a great actor but miscast here and he felt so himself. According to several sources he was also completely indifferent. To this day I can't understand that David O'Selznick thought that was the best choice for the part.But there are of course also reasons why this probably is the most famous movie of all time.The photo/scenery: for 1939 nothing short of absolutely sensational. Hard to believe really and decades before it's time.The soundtrack: also, put into context, one of the greatest of all time.To a degree, the story: yes it is a ""civil war soap opera"" but the story is quite ok and some of the characters rather interesting.So.. since that first viewing I have actually come to enjoy it for what it is. It will never be a favorite but it fascinates me more than many other movies.Of course I have to finish talking a little bit about the racism issues because of BLM as well.I get it. I get what annoys people about this movie. Still.. I feel that the criticism is exaggerated and IS exaggerated because of the fame and praise for this movie.Because I don't feel blacks are badly portrayed or mistreated in an unacceptable way. Ok, I know they complain about stereotypical portrayal and ""happy slaves"" but I don't really agree actually.. loyal servants more than slaves, absolutely, but happy? Was that kind of relationship never the case in any household? Were slaves always treated badly by their owners and beaten etc.? In some cases, absolutely, but who wanted to watch that in 1939? Would it have been a better option to show the owners torturing their slaves than showing a decent relationship? To me, I doubt it.. And the movie is still set during the civil wat so there WERE slaves.. as tragic as that fact is.I know that Selznick put a lot of effort in trying not to affend anyone and I think he did a decent job no matter the criticism of today.By the way, you can also argue for the fact that Southerners were portrayed as naive and smug going into that war with such limited resources and also that the Yankees were bloodthirsty barbarians who just killed everyone in their way. About that there is not much talk..Finally.. to put things in perspective there is one other classic movie that I will never watch because of its obvious racism and that is ""Birth of a Nation"". From what I have learned it's unacceptable even by 1915 standards. GWTW has its flaws but it's not even close to that level and again, considering it was made 1939 I think it is a decent watch on all levels."
grim_angel,"Feb 8, 2000",3/10,"I have yet to figure out the allure of this film.  A whining girl falls in lust, watches a whole lot of other people much worse off than herself for a while, whines some more, goes home and vows to make her own life better rather than helping others.  There, I just saved three plus hours of your life.  Go help a homeless stranger, since you now have the time."

The film might be enduring 4 hours long and might test the patience of the viewers but despite of the length of the film the film will not bore you and will keep you mesmerized.Acting is the strongest aspect of the film and all the characters were just mesmerizing. All the characters and side characters were amazing. The screenplay of the film is slow but effective. A must watch film for every film buff."
Ghenghy,"Feb 24, 2002",10/10,"And that is truly a shame. Fans of revisionist history should stay away. You'll only be offended by the somewhat historically accurate and faithful adaptation of a time and culture you don't understand, and haven't been affected by. The only issue I have with this film is the portrayal of post war reconstruction with all the central figures of the story emerging after the war as prosperous businessmen-please! But then again that's not what Hollywood's all about,is it? Still a very powerful and relevant film. And while I'll admit that Miss Scarlet is a completely despicable character, no one can question her strength and spirit as she grows from spoiled a and sheltered socialite, to survivor, warrior, and cold hearted mercenary. A great film with only a few minor faults 10/10."
caspian1978,"Apr 15, 2001",8/10,"Say what you will about Scarlet O'Hara, Gone With the Wind was a classic when it came out in 1939 and it will remain a classic for years to come. A movie marvel, Gone With the Wind was a triumph to be made. Not a single weak link in the film, Gone With the Wind is an example of what an American film should be. Unlike GIANT, Gone With the Wind does not represent the American Blockbuster. Instead, it represents everything good about film. The acting, direction, the production, the story, it all came into place with Gone With the Wind."
rbverhoef,"Jan 7, 2004",10/10,"'Gone with the Wind' is one of the greatest American classics ever made. It tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, played the very beautiful Vivien Leigh. She is one of the most selfish heroines you will ever see in a movie and still care for her. She is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) but he marries to Melanie Hamilton. She is played by Olivia de Havilland in a great performance. A new man in Scarlett's life is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) but Scarlett does everything to get what she wants including marrying someone for money and her own benefit. Rhett loves Scarlett with all his heart, mainly because they are much the same. They both think the world is there for them. Melanie and Scarlett become friends.The movie is set in the time of the Civil War. What happens exactly with Scarlett, Rhett, Ashley and Melanie is for you to see but the war is pretty important for the story and the way it is used is great. The story itself is great anyway. Although the movie is long it is never boring. A reason for that is the performances. I already mentioned Olivia de Havilland, Clark Gable is very good, charming and sometimes funny, Hattie McDaniel as the black made is outstanding but I have to say that the best thing in this movie is Vivien Leigh. To make you care for a character like that is a pretty hard thing to do, but she makes it seem so easy. It is one of the strongest performances I have seen.Besides the story and the acting we have the music, the sets, the costumes, the cinematography and of course the direction. It is all great. It was made in 1939 and over 60 years later it still is a very impressive movie."
StevenKeys,"Feb 24, 2020",10/10,"Scarlett (O'Hara) Hamilton: ""I could dance with Abe Lincoln himself!""Margaret (b Atlanta) found a porcelain pin among the post-war rubble, scrubbed it clean, set it on the mantel, began to dream, put that to words and called it Gone With the Wind.What do you write about a four hour epic showcasing maybe the most beguiling leading lady (Leigh), commanding lead man (Gable: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn!""), charming characters (Melanie Mammy) in arguably the best film ever made? Whatever it is, you keep it under 3000 words.If you're of the PC persuasion, have feelings easily hurt or think the classics are just so much cinema snooze, don't bother watching. But if you've a warm heart, like its strings tugged on a bit, understand historical context, know the difference between a documentary and movie, you'll find the time needed to drink-in this sweeping, familial Civil War drama is very well spent. Others could've played Scarlett, no doubt to good reviews (Davis Oberon Goddard), but only Vivien could've been Mitchell's buoyant belle, clearly the central character, though, a mistake to've penned a sequel titled in her name alone (Ripley) (91) for the 2d half of GWTW is really Rhett's story. He's the grounding, Tara firma as it were, the love, unrequited it may be, and yet, it's the meaning of the Ashley character that makes it one of the most curious. Leslie Howard (d 43) balked at playing the hesitant Wilkes who may be Mitchell's nod to Lee, learned men clinging to a corrupt code who struggle with divided loyalties, choosing state (VA) over nation (USA), Wilkes engaging the additional battle of love (Melanie) vs passion (Scarlett).Those with a hidden agenda will have you believe in the absurd, that producer Selznick, he of Jewish heritage, sought to sentimentalize or make monument to the CSA and slavery. The plain truth, easy enough to see by those who watch film with an eye for entertainment and art, is that David O, along with directors Fleming, Cukor & Wood, elaborately portray the pain of life and circumstance, a treatment for which pharmacology holds no monopoly of patents but for which movies offer some relief.Political correctness the new Red Scare, Blue, as it were, a power grab no more progressive than the red variety was patriotic. It makes blacklists, kills classic art and business responds as it did in the 50s with fear, rather than education and dialogue. Non-conformity is still the crime, charged un-American then, racist in the new millennium. As corporations own the rights to most vintage movies and their target market, youth, typically have no interest in such art, expect holders in coming years to edit or remove from sale & display, classics broadly deemed unsuitable by the PC police, likely leading to creation of a 30s style (pre-Code), illicit film genre called pre-PC, for those that survive.If you've a boycott bee in your bonnet because of unpleasant characterizations (Prissy) & historical telling of events, consider, when Big Sam saves Scarlett at the bridge and Rhett does mix & mingle with Mammy over bourbons (it didn't win her the Oscar but surely won Hattie the esteem of her race, he, gratitude of visionaries), the film's makers are firing off an early round for Civil Rights. Does Gone With the Wind romanticize events? Of course it does (""Cavaliers""), and that's why it's called cinema (4/4)."
rickinbamberg,"Jan 22, 2005",10/10,"If you have ever considered GWTW to be less than a masterpiece, you'll be swayed by the 65th Anniversary Edition DVD. The 4-disc set features the remastered film and more extras than you could possibly watch in one day (after watching the film, of course). The two-hour making-of documentary is fascinating and shows how the producer (David O. Selznick) of the film affected the cast, director(s) and writer(s) -- and shows the publicity frenzy that was the hunt for Scarlett. The feature of Olivia De Havilland (in 2004) discussing her role as Melanie is a real treat. The picture and sound are great on the 65th Anniversary DVD, and the special features are a true treasure. Accept no substitutes, seek out the 65th Anniversary DVD and bring it home."
moviesfilmsreviewsinc,"Apr 6, 2022",10/10,"""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy and free the slaves as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. But we've known that for years; the tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 60th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. For the story it wanted to tell, it was the right film at the right time. Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman. The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. And there is a joyous flamboyance in the visual style that is appealing in these days when so many directors have trained on the blandness of television. Consider an early shot where Scarlett and her father look out over the land, and the camera pulls back, the two figures and a tree held in black silhouette with the landscape behind them. Or the way the flames of Atlanta are framed to backdrop Scarlett's flight in the carriage. Some of the individual shots in ""GWTW"" still have the power to leave us breathless, including the burning of Atlanta, the flight to Tara and the ""street of dying men"" shot, as Scarlett wanders into the street and the camera pulls back until the whole Confederacy seems to lie broken and bleeding as far as the eye can see."
markrichardson1999,"Nov 22, 2004",1/10,"This move travesties the history of the war and especially of the Reconstruction, which was not at all the disaster that pro-Southern historians and their sympathizers would have us believe. This film is awash, as one would expect, in nostalgia for the ancien regime, and not even the charm of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable can make me forget that fact. Such scenes as the one in which the director has an African-American character riding along in a carriage singing Marching Through Georgia are obviously meant to inspire bitterness and resentment in the viewer, and the Federal troops are uniformly portrayed as brutes. This is nothing but polite version of Birth of a Nation--at least so far as its politics go."
Lejink,"Sep 20, 2015",9/10,"The fact that as at my time of writing, ""Gone With The Wind"" stands only at number 152 in the best movie rankings of this site, I hope might be mainly attributable to the relative youth of the posters here. Here surely is Golden Age Hollywood's lasting monument to itself, which like another big-subject civil war movie from a previous generation (D W Griffiths' ""Birth Of A Nation"") while politically flawed in its treatment of black people, nevertheless stands as a significant and magnificent piece of movie-making.It's a film I'd dearly love to see on the big screen but all my viewings of it so far have been on TV which can't begin to do justice to the scale and colour of the achievement here. I know there's some contention about who directed which parts of it but I'm going to give my kudos to Victor Fleming who I believe did the lion's share of the work behind the camera. The sets are magnificent and the set-pieces even more so with several jaw-dropping scenes which are testament to artistic imagination and technical achievement in equal measure. Of course the two most celebrated of these I suppose are Rhett Butler's rescue of Melanie, Scarlett and Missy just ahead of the burning edifices of Atlanta and the rising dolly-shot of the wounded and dead of the Confederate Army as Scarlett seeks out Dr Meade.But let's not forget the acting too, especially the two leads who are both terrific, Gable, in his greatest role, is mean, moody and magnificent, while Vivien Leigh in her Hollywood breakthrough role is captivating as the wild, wilful and wonderful Scarlett O'Hara. While the characters of Ashley and Melanie Wilkes seem almost too good to be true (Ashley's guilty feelings for Scarlett aside), they are nonetheless beautifully played by Leslie Howard and Olivia De Havilland. Hattie McDaniel belies the racial stereotyping of her Mammy character to deliver an unforgettable, often scene-stealing performance.It is difficult today to witness some of the political incorrectness of the treatment given to the black characters, in the main shown as subservient, excitable and slow-witted, not sufficiently redeemed by their brave deeds in the film (Big Sam saves Scarlett from being raped, while Mammy effectively acts as the conscience of the film) and it is dreadful for modern ears to hear the ""d"" word spoken so casually if only sparingly.However I'm not going to criticise the movie for that when there's so much good to praise. It could be argued too that it's better up to the end of the war and goes a bit soap-opera-ish thereafter and the death-count starts to over-dramatically mount up towards the end, but such is the power of the film-making that it sweeps the viewer right along to both the central character's famous last words. By the time Max Steiner's famous theme plays over the final scene of the defiant Scarlett framed (has any film ever bettered the use of silhouette than this one?) against the burnt ochre sky, you realise you have watched something very special.Movie-making has unquestionably got bigger down the years, especially in the C-Gen, SFX-fests of recent times but I don't think any film will ever look or play better than this one. It's been many times said and written that 1939 was probably the year that more great movies came out of Hollywood than any other, but this one outdoes them all. And most other films since, come to that..."
Akbar6890,"Aug 25, 2025",10/10,"What an amazing movie it was.One of the most complete films I have ever seen, and it fully deserved a rating of 10.Outstanding and flawless in every way.Even though it was made 86 years ago, it was technically impeccable.Top-notch cinematography and music, an exceptionally excellent screenplay, very good acting-especially Vivien Leigh, whose performance was among the highest and best I have ever seen.The story was very good and fully justified its 4-hour length; I never felt bored at all.I thoroughly enjoyed it while watching, it left a great impact on me, and even after seeing it, it stays on my mind."
DLochner,"Mar 6, 2024",9/10,"An incredible film, even after many decades. It has lost nothing of its tension, has lost nothing of its visual power. A template for every cinematic family epic. Deep and poignant on many levels.The pictures are simply incredible for their time. The visual splendor of the film is breathtaking. From the expansive Southern landscapes to the opulent costumes and sets, the viewer is transported to a bygone era, brought to life by the masterful cinematography and impressive production design.In addition to its aesthetic brilliance, the film also deals with themes such as racism, class differences and the consequences of war, making it a captivating and profound work at the same time. Despite its epic length of over four hours, ""Gone With the Wind"" never loses momentum or relevance. Each scene is carefully staged and contributes to the overall effect of the film.Clark Gable as Rhett Butler is the perfect complement to Leigh's Scarlett. His charisma and masculine presence give the character of Rhett an unparalleled depth and complexity. The chemistry between Leigh and Gable is electric and contributes significantly to the success of the film.""I swear I will never go hungry again."""
dehezanatalia,"Dec 21, 2024",8/10,"One of the most noticeable things the audience noticed about the film is that it is about 4 hours long. I know I was intimidated before I watched the film that I might not like it or it might be boring. Let this review ease your suspicions or doubt and watch the film. I believe one must watch Gone With the Wind at least once in their lifetime to truly appreciate the history of film. Nowadays, I would compare this film to a four part series that was just combined into one. It feels like binge watching an entire TV show on Netflix.A brief summary about the film is that it centers around Scarlett, a country maiden in the south who goes through the challenges of the American Civil War. Along with the struggles of the war she manages to find a way to be taken out of poverty while being in a love triangle. Scarlett faces some tragedies towards the end but it all helps her character develop throughout the plot. The movie is not some documentary about the war but a story about a woman in love who goes through obstacles to understand herself. She is a flawed character in the beginning and I think it is fair to allow the audience decide whether they like Scarlett or not. It would not be interesting if everyone in the theaters were to think the same about a character. It becomes more fun if other people are able to form their own opinions and enjoy a conversation about it."
Richie-67-485852,"Dec 9, 2017",10/10,"I was dating at the time this came out in a small theater on Hollywood blvd for a short run. Me and my girlfriend decided to see a movie and chose this one not knowing anything about it. We sat in the balcony and was immediately captured by the music, characters, story-line and each other as we watched what we thought was a memorable night out together. Unknown to me, when part one ended I thought the movie was over and remarked boy that was good but I wonder what happened after that. We got up to go and found out it was only intermission. I cannot describe the feelings of joy knowing there was more. We were not disappointed either. When it ended I felt totally satisfied and changed forever more. A great movie with my future wife locked into each other for our lifetime. Since then, I have seen this movie so many times never tiring of it. I bought the collectors sets (vhs) and finally the DVD. Just finished watching it again loving every moment until the end. Will I see it again? Why not after all tomorrow is another day....Good movie to eat with while watching"
Hotwok2013,"Jun 27, 2015",N/A,"When a group of women who called themselves The United Daughters Of The Confederacy heard that the role of Scarlett Ohara might be going to an Englishwoman they felt offended. Then when they heard that the role might go to Katherine Hepburn they changed their tune. ""Better an Englishwoman than a Yankee"", they said. Without a shadow of doubt, ""Gone With The Wind"" based on Margaret Mitchell's best seller remains one of the greatest movies ever made. Vivien Leigh was not only a great beauty she was also a great actress & gives a fantastic performance as Scarlet Ohara. Everyone who had read the book had said that the role of Rhett Butler just had to go to Clark Gable, even though Selznick International Pictures had to make heavy concessions to the MGM Studio for his services. Gable, himself, was somewhat reluctant to accept the role because he realised it was a ""woman's picture"" & he might not live up to expectations. He did, of course, & the rest is history. Despite endless rewrites of the script & a change of director from George Cukor to Victor Fleming it all worked out well in the end. When Victor Fleming took over he is reported as saying the script was ""no effing good"" & ordered another complete rewrite. Max Steiner wrote a really marvellous sweeping musical score for the movie, another of its strong points. Possibly the most memorably famous scene in all movie history takes place about halfway through the movie to Max Steiners music known as Tara's Theme. With the confederacy destroyed by war & Scarlet Ohara's home Tara also ruined she stares angrily up to the heavens & makes her ""As God Is My Witness"" speech. It is wonderful stuff & this a wonderful movie."
DanteRiggs,"Jun 14, 2020",7/10,"This movie is a bit too melodramatic for me. I don't usually watch romance movies.However, I have to admit the cinematography is pretty nice. There are some really good images. The high points for me were the civil war scenes and especially Clark Gable's acting. He is really good, I love his sarcasm. His character was really really charismatic. Imagine RDJ's Tony Stark, dialed up to eleven.
The main actress was also pretty good. There is some interesting character development.All in all, I think it deserves a watch."
SnoopyStyle,"Nov 27, 2013",10/10,"I can't add much more to the reviews that handbooks on filmmaking haven't already. It epitomizes the golden age of Hollywood. It's grand. It's a technical marvel. It has the most iconic romance since Romeo and Juliet. Clark Gable, and Vivien Leigh has more quotable lines than anybody else. Is there a better line than Rhett Butler's ""No, I don't think I will kiss you, although you need kissing, badly. That's what's wrong with you. You should be kissed and often, and by someone who knows how.""? It is bigger than a simple movie.However, the more modern critiques have centered on the treatment of the slavery issue, and the general whitewashing of that 'civilization'. It's a fair criticism, but it misses the times and the subject matter. The movie isn't about slavery. It's a fable of its times. I won't be subtracting any points. I don't want to add retroactive morality to my review.Most of the black characters are noble subservients in the movie. It's understandable to object to the portrayal. However, Sam is one of the more heroic persona. Other than Priss and the carpetbagger, they weren't stupid or mean spirited. I think the best description is whitewashing. They covered up the brutality, and gave it a nice gleaming coat. For its times, I don't think we can expect more. Slavery in The Patriot (2000) was marginally more realistic than this. To me, that seems much more egregious."
Prince-P,"Nov 20, 2022",7/10,"Producer David O Selznick offered Margaret Michell $50,000 for the rights to ""Gone With the Wind"". That was the highest amount paid for a first-time novel at the time. Selznick wanted Clark Gable in the lead role, but because the star was busy, Selznick was forced to postpone the film for two years. The producer used the waiting time to search for the right actress to play Gable's love interest.The movie is set in the American South against the backdrop of the Civil War. It tells the story of the strong-willed daughter of a plantation owner and her romance with a handsome, but roguish racketeer.Finding a suitable candidate for the female lead would prove more difficult than expected. More than 1,400 women were tested before Selznick decided on a young Vivien Leigh. The choice of director was also problematic. George Cukor started the film, but after a few weeks he was fired and replaced by Victor Flemming.In fact, everything about ""Gone With the Wind"" was big and complicated. For example the destruction of Atlanta. The film crew burned many old sets that needed to be cleared from the studio lot, including the great wall from ""King Kong"". The fire was so intense that Culver City residents jammed the telephone lines, thinking the whole MGM Studio was burning down.At the Academy Awards ""Gone With the Wind"" took home eight Oscars. Among them Hattie McDaniel became the first African-American to receive the accolade, beating out her co-star Olivia de Havilland. David O Selznick won an Oscar for best picture.Tragically, ""Gone With the Wind"" overshadowed the rest of Selznick's career. In an interview shortly before his death the producer said that he felt that he had wasted his life trying to outdo it."
hmsgroop,"May 12, 2000",1/10,"Unfortunately Gone with the Wind remains a most overrated film in history. It tells us a story of a spoiled, egoistic girl, incapable of loving anybody but herself, ready to do anything to have her stomach filled. What is her turning to Rhett for money to restore her Tara but a kind of walking the panel? If that's a heroine what are the nation's morals? Unfortunately it is Vivien Leigh that saved the film. If it were not for her nobody would have noticed this run-of-the -mill production. It has no cultural or intellectual worth. At least it has no story to tell the world. I am sure that American history could have furnished a film crew with a better plot or a more breathtaking love story. Only incurable pragmatics can learn something from this film and this is how to kill a human being in oneself to earn money. Scarlett is a failure and a disaster in everything, she couldn't even look properly after her own child. If she had had an eye open for her daughter nothing of the kind would have happened. On the whole, the rich also weep, soap gives suds and leaves scum behind."
rebel_sgeezy89,"May 23, 2020",10/10,"As a millennial, it is important for all fellow millennials to remember to not watch this film from a 21st century perspective. In order to appreciate Gone With The Wind, or any old classic film, one must watch it from the perspective of the period it was filmed as well as the period it describes. Certainly, the portrayal of the African-American characters is very dated, but that takes nothing away from how these roles were performed. Furthermore, while most today would disagree with the film's sympathetic disposition towards the south during the Civil War, everyone can agree that Gone With The Wind does an incredible job of highlighting the monumental costs of a war - the loss of lives, the strain put on those left behind afterwards, and the horribly wasteful drain of resources, money, and emotion that a war causes for everyone involved.Another thing Gone With The Wind did extremely well was to abandon the traditional roles of heroes and heels and instead blur those lines, showing the good and bad qualities of every character. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler spent his entire life as a slimy, womanizing sleazeball, yet demonstrated numerous times that he has a huge heart. Vivien Leigh as Scarlett was a very selfish, crass, and heartless person, yet showed the strength and resilience to persevere through any hard situation thrown her way. Olivia de Havilland portrayed Melly as an incredibly warm, caring, sweet individual who cared deeply for everyone around her, but suffered from naïvety and an inability to truly care about herself. Just to note for Olivia fans, this role is a must-see because it was the first role that removed her from the standard ""beautiful girl pursued by the lead man"" roles that Warner typically gave her, and it truly gave her an opportunity to show off her acting chops like never before. Leslie Howard's Ashley was the strong war hero yet was too weak to fight off Scarlett's continuous tempting advances. Last to mention but certainly not least was Hattie McDaniel as Mammy. She may have been portrayed as an uneducated house slave, yet several times was the smartest character in a scene.There are a couple characters who could've been done better, though. Victor Jory was a brilliant heel character actor, and Jonas Wilkinson was one of the few true heels in the film, yet he was confined to just a handful of scenes and was quite insignificant overall. Butterfly McQueen as Prissy was insufferable. It's not clear who told her to act like that or why they did, but her lines almost exclusively consist of screaming and extreme overacting, and her scenes are extremely painful to watch. She does have one worthwhile moment in the film though - to avoid a complete spoiler, just watch her lips.Perhaps the most impressive thing about Gone With The Wind is the cinematography. The color is gorgeous, and the HD copies of the film available today make it look like it was filmed just a few years ago. The use of thousands of extras in the outdoor hospital scene was very impactful. The fire scene was absolutely brilliant. Long-distance shots are used perfectly throughout the film. If someone wasn't told what year this film was made, it is highly doubtful that anyone would guess it dates all the way back to 1939. It could easily pass for the 90s. It looks THAT good.Overall, this is one of the all-time greats of classic film. Gone With The Wind is a must-watch for all classic film buffs!"
HowToCarrieOn,"Jul 7, 2007",10/10,"There has never been any movie in the cinema history that was more a legend than ""Gone with the wind"". It is undeniable that this movie contains lots of goofs, but, despite all this, it is a blockbuster and a real masterpiece. Completely NOT overrated.I love this movie. I can't explain why exactly. There are sooo many reasons. I first saw it when I was a little kid and still can't forget it.It's so special if you can return to movie even when you had seen it more than 100 times... And GWTW is this kind of a movie.In my opinion a movie can not be a good when the acting is not good. And there acting is great! Every character is portrayed so magnificently!I will start with the supporting players. Barbara O'Neil, though only 28 while filming, played mother of quite adult daughters. She was the Ellen Robillard Mitchell descirbed in her book: so stative, so smart, so lady. Thomas Mitchell should have received Oscar for his Gerald O'Hara portroyal, and I think he did not just because he won for ""Stagecoach"" that year. Scarlett's sisters are really well cast. But the best supporting performance of the film is this one of Hattie McDaniel's. She is simply magnificent, moving and unforgettable as Mummy. Just amazing.Many people claim that Leslie Howard did not fit the role of Ashley. They may be right in some sense, but let's think it over twice. Ashley was more handsome as Mitchell described him, but he was a dreamer who could not find himself in a new, cruel world. And Howard showed this quality as best as possible.Of course, Olivia de Havilland's performance of Melanie was as worth of Oscar as Hattie McDaniel's, but later on she was given what she deserved (Oscars for ""To each his own"" and ""The Heiress""). She plays Melanie with such a sensibility, but she manages to show her hidden strength, but not in a dominate way. Clark Gable was so unsure of his talent till the end of his life. I think that he was a great actor. He's so real as Rhett, and he has to play several dramatic scenes. And he does it perfectly-remember that playing those scenes, like those after Scarlett's miscarriage, needed acting talent. He's perfect. But, I won't hide my opinion that Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is the best and most powerful point of the whole movie. Vivien won the role when she was completely unknown. She managed to master the Southern accent as well. She did not play Scarlett. She WAS Scarlett. But only in this movie. She never acted any other character the same way. She is terrific and has all those features that original Mitchell's Scarlett possesses. I heard that she wanted to play the part exactly as Mitchell created it, and Fleming wanted her to play it just as a bitch, so they fought about it badly, but, finally, Vivien did a great work and her Oscar was something very obvious.If you love good cinema, if you want to see something moving and something that is not getting old, though almost 70!, do not miss it."
cricketbat,"Jul 5, 2023",8/10,"If you've got the time & patience, Gone with the Wind is well worth a watch. This iconic film, set against the backdrop of the Civil War, delivers a compelling drama with impressive costumes, remarkable set design, and memorable characters. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable do a good job of portraying their dislikeable characters in a way that doesn't make you completely hate them, but the real heart of the film is Olivia de Havilland as Melanie Hamilton. Her pure goodness keeps this story from becoming too cynical. I can see why this epic & heartbreaking tale has captivated audiences for almost a century."
elvircorhodzic,"May 9, 2016",9/10,"GONE WITH THE WIND is an epic melodrama which is very difficult to describe. Considering the thirties this movie is something most original in the history of cinema. Institution. The true magic of life. Of course, the term ""magic"" I think everything that lives in a certain time pass. I'm a little disappointed because I think it is in the final hour of an epic spectacle given the characteristics of the classic soap opera. This movie is full of freshness and strange irony. The irony of the film no one escaped, at least a ""gentleman"" in the American South. The horrors of war are quite credible. The arrogance and pomposity ""Southerners"" are completely the opposite of the characteristics of the main characters.Gone with the Wind is a love story at the time of the Civil War, in which each in its own way serves some human punishment.Although I am aware of racist moment that really exists in the film, I would not have acted rudely. Although the ""slaves"" happy and complex, their characterization is not at all realistic. This is best seen when they become part of the romance or love affairs of their ""masters"". The film is quite delicate and subtle. Some erotic themes are, to the extent permissible content, quite convincing.Set design, costume design, framing, story, theme and music are top notch. From the first sequence can be seen magic and suggest that this movie is very expensive.Gable (Rhett Butler) and Leigh (Scarlett O'Hara) are excellent. Scarlett is the central figure, and Rhett's character who meets her. Both characters are outlaws, unaccepted and stubborn. Perfect for each other, or just doomed?Howard (Ashley Wilkes) and de Havilland (Melanie Hamilton) are boring. However, when acting individually their good acting comes into play. They look great in a pair with the main two characters. It is interesting that even they do not fit into the concept of people from the South.Novel. So many tragic figure, none of which is happy. One persistent striving toward the one she can not have, and when it gets it is no longer interesting.I always watch this movie with relish, while I do not feel numb ass."
kevin_robbins,"Nov 2, 2021",10/10,"Gone with the Wind (1939) is a movie that was my grandmother's all time favorite film that I recently rewatched on HBOMAX. The storyline follows the struggles of a young lady with a lot of pride and moxie and love for money and fortune and the lifestyle that goes with it. She resides in the south as they are about to head into the civil war, during the civil war and as the south initially emerges from the war. She, like most of the south, experiences lots of tragedy because of the war but she does a lot of it to herself. This movie is directed by Victor Fleming (The Wizard of Oz) and stars Clark Gable (Mutiny on the Bounty), Vivien Leigh (A Streetcar Names Desire), Barbara O'Neil (Tower of London), George Reeves (The Adventures of Superman) and Fred Crane (A Gay Amigo). The storyline for this picture is absolutely incredible with the characters being so dynamic, unpredictable and stubborn. The backdrops and landscapes were beautiful and well shot. The cinematography for this age was impressive - every set, house details, dress and prop was magnificent. The troubling circumstances honestly made me laugh, like the characters were getting what they deserved based on their beliefs. The action scenes, various fights and gun shots were great. There were so many dramatic sequences in this that were mesmerizing and well executed and really keeps the audience glued to the movie despite its run time. This is an all time great American cinematic masterpiece that is an absolute must see and an easy 10/10."
movieed1,"Jun 12, 2020",10/10,"Th the story of the South and the Stiff neck society is perfectly isolated in film forever. This film is NOT about race, but about a period of TIME, a portrayal of the lifestyle of the South at that time. Rhett is a Profiteer, Scarlet a hopeless spoiled romantic, the upper crust despising a ""slave auction"" of white women to raise $ for ""The Cause"". And Hattie McDonald... the portrayal of a Loving, caring, nurturing outspoken mammy. (Which is a Derivative if MOMMY). This movie need be watched as an example of a Moment in time. Of an impolite society doing its best to be ""polite"" under false pretense. It HAS HISTORICAL VALUE. The costumes, the settings, the burning of Atlanta.
Margaret Mitchell had it right, this is an Epic story with which each subsequent viewing enlightens one on the understandings of human nature and self-determination. Hattie Mc Daniel is the best, Butterfly McQueen May have portrayed a stereotype... however we MUST view this story as an epic almost mythological tale of the beginnings of Civil Rights."
paulsrobinson,"May 12, 2013",7/10,"""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""One of the most famous lines in film history, is perform brilliantly by Clark Gable, But everyone in this historical romantic epic is fantastic. With Vivien Leigh possibly being most suited to her character Scarlett O'Hara. The love story between Scarlett and Rhett butler (Clark Gable) is a doomed romance from the start but takes on a intriguing ride.They just don't make films like this anymore, the grandness of the film is rarely matched. The nature filled rich landscapes. the colours used are truly stunning. The characters relationship does come across as still relevant and realistic possibly more inkeeping with modern day romance.Where i had the problems in this film was not so much the story and anything technically wrong with the production. But it is how unlikable i find the two main leads. As Scarlett and Rhett are so manipulative of each other and others, and at times say and do things that are absolutely unforgivable.The film is a legendary piece of Cinema, but for me the central characters are to unlikable for it to be an all time classic for me."
AlsExGal,"Aug 10, 2013",10/10,"Gone with the Wind is a great visual spectacle, but that wouldn't keep people watching after 75 years if it wasn't for the timeless tales of three kinds of love - obsession mistaken for love (Scarlett for Ashley), sexual obsession turned to love for someone who doesn't reciprocate (Rhett for Scarlett), and true love with a barrier thrown in the way to prevent that love from being physically expressed (Melanie and Ashley) - the barrier being that Melanie cannot have another child without losing her life, and in the 19th century that means only one thing - no sex.Scarlett has it all - beauty, brains, and eventually, a husband who can keep up with her - the dashing Rhett Butler, whom she doesn't appreciate because - well - she has him. She wants what she can't have and has never had - the love of the rather drab and double-minded Ashley Wilkes who loves the not so beautiful not so clever and not so healthy Melanie. One thing that Melanie does have - great heart, and a belief in the honor of the people in her life, regardless of whether that belief is earned or not.The story is also one of transformation as Scarlett goes from pre-War southern Belle to hardened businesswoman post-War, in an effort to keep her family together and to keep the family plantation, Tara, out of Yankee and carpetbagger hands. Unlike her more genteel family and friends, who either lose everything or in one tragic case - her father - lose their sanity, she holds it together against forces she doesn't really understand and does whatever she has to do to beat the Yankees at their own game. But through it all she just can't get that unrequited obsession with Ashley out of her head, and that is more her personal undoing than anything the War did or ever could have done.This film is a demonstration of the best the studio system could do in that fabled year of 1939, and it showed that the studios had finally ""got"" putting together a costume drama that conveys true raw human emotions and reactions and even eroticism without crossing that pesky production code line. For anybody who has ever made a wrong decision in love that you wish you could do over, for anyone who has ever had their world suddenly change for the worse and had to adapt, I highly recommend this film."
tristanmccay,"May 13, 2023",7/10,"Who doesn't love a classic! This over-romanticized southern gem has been beloved by my grandmother for years so I have been subjected to it my whole life. Every time I watch this movie I just think of my grandma so it's hard not to like it. Like yes Scarlet is a total brat, she literally gave up a hunk like Rhett for a dude named ASHLEY! Be so for real with me right now! The whole love triangle thing was so lame and this movie really took away from what the time period was all about, the civil war. Also I hated Ashley! Bro literally married his cousin... Anyway I still really love this movie despite how long it was and how inaccurate it is historically. I loved the soundtrack and visually it is very pretty in color. I'll always watch this movie with my grandma and love it because despite its flaws it means a lot to my grandma so it has a place in my heart."
lugonian,"Jul 14, 2023",10/10,"GONE WITH THE WIND (Selznick International, in association with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, 1939), directed by Victor Fleming, is the screen adaptation to Margaret Mitchell's best selling 1936 novel. Subtitled ""The Story of the Old South,"" it stars Clark Gable in his iconic role of Rhett Butler, but it's Vivien Leigh, the British actress, who plays its central character, Scarlett O'Hara, whose practically in every scene from start to finish. As much as this could have been titled SCARLETT O'HARA, GONE WITH THE WIND became the chosen title, though one of its most famous lines, ""Tomorrow is Another Day"" might have been sufficient. With a cast of thousands, produced in Technicolor, it also includes one of the most memorable scores ever conducted by Max Steiner. For baby boomers of the 1960s to 1980s who have never seen GONE WITH THE WIND would recognize the scoring best as the introduction to ""The Million Dollar Movie"" on WOR, Channel 9 in New York City. This is where the score and the legend of Scarlett O'Hara all began.The plot, told in chapter form, begins in Tara where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh), popular with many suitors as the Tarleton brothers (George Reeves and Fred Crane), but actually Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). Ashley loves his cousin, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland), whom he intends to marry. Scarlett, daughter of Irish proud plantation owner, Gerald (Thomas Mitchell) and wife, Ellen (Barbara O'Neil), has two other sisters, Coreen (Ann Rutherford) and Suellen (Evelyn Keyes). The O'Hara's also have their Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) who has not only served the family, but becomes an crucial part in Scarlett's life. Before Ashley goes off to serve in the Civil War, Scarlett marries Melanie's brother, Charles (Rand Brooks), who soon makes her a widow. Scarlett becomes the interest of Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a man with questionable reputation, having been expelled from West Point. After the war ends, Scarlett, being the sole factor of looking after Melanie and her newborn baby, tries keeping her plantation home from Jonas Wilkerson (Victor Jory) through his high taxing by marrying Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who dies, leaving Scarlett to take charge of his lumber business. Scarlett's marriage to Rhett Butler and daughter, Bonnie Blue (Cammie King) comes only as his hope for her to change her affections from Ashley to him. Co-starring Ona Munson (Belle Watling); Butterfly McQueen (Prissy); Harry Davenport (Doctor Meade); Jane Darwell, Laura Hope Crews, Isabel Jewell, Alicia Rhett, among many others.While this production could have been told through two separate movies, with its sequel titled TOMORROW IS ANOTHER DAY, GONE WITH THE WIND, along with opening and closing overture, has the distinction of being the longest movie (225 minutes) of the 1930s. Some may claim the first half to be better than its second, or visa versa. As much as the plot elements differ from the novel, the final results proved favorable to make this as one of the greatest movies ever made. Along with Academy Award wins, including Best Picture, (Best Actress) Vivien Leigh, (Best Supporting Actresses) Olivia De Havilland and winner Hattie McDaniel), etc., Gable, who was nominated, didn't win. Though nobody can play Rhett Butler best than Clark Gable, a role he was born to play, he being in and out of the story through long stretches may be one of the reasons of his loss. Filled with memorable scenes too numerous to mention, the ones that stand out most the burning of Atlanta; Scarlett becoming prettier through the passage of time; Scarlett's catch phrase of ""Fiddle Dee-Dee,"" but nothing comes off best as Gable's closing line.When GONE WITH THE WIND first played on commercial television in November 1976, it was a big event, having been reissued in theaters many times after its 1939 release. Distributed on home video in the 1980s and later DVD, it had played on various Ted Turner cable channels, notably Turner Classic Movies since its humble beginning in 1994. Currently restored, TCM is where the movie is going to stay. (****)"

mahamaqboolf,"Oct 8, 2023",10/10,"This is by far one of the best films i have ever watched. Yes, i know the time length can be difficult to commit to, but it is worth every minute. This is one of the few films that have me stuck to my seat and quite frankly, i would've loved for it to go on forever. The character development is wonderful to watch play out, all actors bring their all to the table and even the small details like the setting, design and appearance of actors was just perfect. I have re watched this film once a year and it never fails to impress me. I have forced friends to give it a chance and watch it with me and midway thru they refuse to even get up for a water break cause they're just as amazed as i was watching for the first time. I will never stop recommending this film, it brings so many genres to the table and the story is just phenomenal to witness."
magical-kingdom,"Jun 28, 2015",10/10,"I'm a movie buff,so there are several favorites on my list but if a number one choice must be made then hands down it would be ""Gone With The Wind"" was, is, and will always be the best movie ever made. Ever since its premiere in 1939 ""Gone With The Wind"" was ahead of it's time and set the bar for all motion pictures after it. There would be no ""Star Wars,"" ""Ben Hur,"" ""Titanic,"" or ""Lord Of The Rings"" Trilogy if ""Gone With The Wind"" had not been such a grand achievement. Every frame of the film drips with sheer perfection. The sets are grand, the acting marvelous, and the direction impeccable. My favorite thing about ""Gone With The Wind"" would have to be the cast. Hattie MacDaniel was marvelous as Mammy, Olivia DeHaviland heavenly as Melanie, Leslie Howard great as Ashley, and Clark Gable is sheer perfection as Rhett Butler. Last but certainly not least, Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara.Every time I watch this film,and I've seen it more times than I can remember, I'm always astonished by the freshness of the story, the power of the emotions it conveys and the beautiful, detailed images of a time long gone. That this film was made in the 1930's is almost incomprehensible to me. The challenges that had to be overcome in order to bring it to life must have been monumental. But come to life it did, and still does! A triumph of film-making ingenuity and genius, that will live on for many generations to come.Footnote: I really enjoyed the sequel called ""Scarlett"" especially the climax. My sister encouraged me to watch but silly as it may seem I felt a sequel to this masterpiece was sacrilegious."
filipemanuelneto,"Jun 25, 2016",10/10,"This film is probably one of the most remarkable in the history of cinema. A film that immortalized the actors who gave life to it and which is already part of the memory of several generations. It won eight Oscars (Best Picture, Best Editing, Best Art Direction, Best Cinematography Color, Best Screenplay, Best Director, Best Leading Actress, Best Supporting Actress - for the first time given to a black actress - and even two special statuettes for RD Musgrave and William Cameron Menzies, for technical achievements) and was nominated for five more. Directed by Victor Fleming and produced by David O. Selznick, this film has a screenplay by Sidney Howard, based on a novel by Margaret Mitchell. The cast is headed by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable.The story of this film is well known, so its difficult to spoil it. Scarlett is a rich, spoiled and capricious girl who likes parties and flirtations but loves Ashley Wilkes, engaged to her cousin Melanie, which awakens in her enormous jealousy. The hardness of the American Civil War destroys the world in which they live and forces the two cousins ​​to help each other to survive, achieving that with the help of Rhett Butler, an industrial bachelor with very bad reputation that falls in love with Scarlett. Following are the efforts to rebuild everything that the winds of war destroyed.Vivien Leigh became, thanks to this, a film legend. Far from being a damsel in distress, her character solves the problems faced thanks to her tenacity and willpower. Its undoubtedly one of the strongest female characters of classical cinema, and makes a perfect match with the bluntness of truculent Captain Butler, played by Gable, one of the biggest heartthrobs that cinema known, famous for the many romances that he lived with most beautiful actresses in Hollywood. In fact, when this film was being shot, the most malicious voices wove several conjectures as to a probable passion between them, but the truth was more funny: the two actors didn't like each other and Leigh even criticized Gable because of his bad breath. And although Gable have hated this movie, the truth is that he has become immortal thanks to it. Olivia de Havilland, another great actress, shone in the role of sweet and kindhearted Melanie, and Leslie Howard did great success as Ashley.Try to analyze the technical aspects of this film is very impressive and shows us the artwork that it is. Hundreds of participants, thousands of horses, costumes designed to recreate the look of the historical clothing. The country scenes are fabulous and some of the war scenes are deeply moving, like the scenes where Scarlett help in the military hospital or the famous Scarlett's oath scene. One of the most famous sequences is the fire of the military barracks, where real fire was used, making the scene more realistic and truly anthological. Bright colors make the movie even more beautiful, from a visual point of view, and the soundtrack, of Max Steiner's authorship, is exceptional. The main theme is easily in the ear, having become one of the most famous songs of the cinema.For all these reasons, this movie immediately gained a huge popularity and is, today, one of the most profitable and popular films ever. For me, its also the best movie ever, despite the many other great films that followed, through the decades."
gbill-74877,"Oct 2, 2018",7/10,"A movie that's certainly worth watching, but it's hard not to be conflicted, and it's a tough one to rate.Positives:Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding in their roles of these two selfish people, who, while difficult to like, spiral around each other and deliver iconic Hollywood moments. He recognizes they're cut from the same cloth and loves her for it, she sees the same thing and hates him. A sexual current runs through their relationship from the first time he undresses her with his eyes, and she remarks ""He looks as if he knows what I look like without my shimmy."" Later he'll tell her ""You should be kissed, and often, and by someone who knows how,"" and it's clear without saying it when he helps her what he wants in return (after all, he's ""not a marrying man""). Gable's character is perceptive throughout the movie, and he's an interesting mix of rogue, gallant, bemused observer, and doting father.The filmmaking is extraordinary, particularly for 1939. There are exquisite scenes in glorious color, and the soundtrack is fantastic. War-time shots in the first half, like the horse and carriage escaping a massive fire, the one of all the wounded laid out, and the operation are memorable.Hattie McDaniel is a delight to watch in the role of Mammy, the tough-minded servant who tries to keep a proper sense of decorum and the willful Scarlett in line. While some criticized her for taking a stereotypical role (similar to the criticism Anna May Wong suffered), this was the part available, and it was a step forward for her to take it, own it, and win an Oscar. Special favors had to be called in just to allow her to get her in to the Cocoanut Grove nightclub for the Oscars, and even then she had to sit in the back at a small table. I recently visited her simple grave in Angelus-Rosedale Cemetery, where she was buried instead of Hollywood Cemetery because she wasn't allowed in to the latter. She was discriminated against even in death, and it's important to remember that racism and segregation weren't just occurring in the past, or only in the Jim Crow South.There is a feminist message in the strength of the two main female characters. Scarlett is manipulative and shallow, but she's also tough and a survivor. She makes it through bleak times, shoots a ravaging Union soldier in the face, and at one point while trying to run a business ""Great balls of fire! Don't bother me anymore, and don't call me sugar!"" Similarly, while Melanie (Olivia de Havilland) can be almost maddeningly pure, seeing the good in everyone despite their obvious evil, she acts as an almost Christ-like role model.Negatives:There is no point sugar-coating this: the movie, and the book it's based on, is racist. It perpetuates the horrifying myth of the loyal, docile, and simple slave. These smiling African-Americans have no interest in freedom, and in the few scenes they're in, they look simply like employees of Plantation, Inc. The character of Prissy is feeble-minded and helpless. The film tried to avoid controversy and be as neutral as possible, but what we see for the most part are essentially cartoons.From its opening credits, the movie perpetuates a myth about an entire way of life, that the South was noble and filled with honorable people, and now sadly all of that is gone. Historically this is inaccurate, and morally it's outrageous. And yet, 70+ years after the war, this was the narrative, with a message diametrically opposed to that of 'Uncle Tom's Cabin'. The slaveholders are shown to be kind and thoughtful aristocrats, and it's instead the Yankee carpetbaggers who are portrayed as cruel and vicious. Deviations from the book are apparently rather modest, but one major one is Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) and another character no longer being members of the KKK; instead they go off to a 'political meeting'. Before the war, Ashley says that ""Most of the miseries of the world were caused by wars, and when the wars were over, no one ever knew what they were about,"" as if this particular war fit that case - being fought over for some vague reason. After the war, he says without a hint of irony ""I will not make money out of the enforced labor and misery of others."" Even Scarlett points out the hypocrisy, but it's as if this male voice, this Major in the Confederate Army can't bring himself to mention slavery or race issues. This is consistent with the shameful Southern apologia that has never truly been dissipated, recent statue removal notwithstanding.In addition to my problems with his role, Leslie Howard does not fit here. He does not seem like a Southern gentleman from the period at all, and does not bring nearly the authenticity that Gable brings in his scenes of passion. In an otherwise fine cast, he is quite weak.The second half of the movie is far too melodramatic, and practically a soap opera. To some this is faithful to the book, entertaining, and helpful to create an epic feel to it all, but to me it's overdone, and artistically sloppy. It also leads to a bloated four hour run time, and I think it would have been more powerful condensed.Summary:
The film is insidious because the story, its characters, and its production value are all so compelling, and yet the background context is so toxic. Can we mentally set aside those gigantic elephants in the room, and forgive it? Is this like a romantic Southern version of 'War and Peace', where we note that in his epic, Tolstoy didn't write of the ownership and oppression to serfs? Can we see it as the viewpoint of a defeated secessionist country, and understand what de Havilland would say in an interview years later - that ""All countries have experienced war and defeat. And survival. They can identify with that film for, I think, that reason."" It's tough. Very tough. I can neither love not despise this film."
rhoffman98,"Oct 11, 2003",1/10,"How can this movie be so popular? Boring and way too long. Plot flops around. Instead of one terrible movie, this would have been better split into 3 very bad movies. Went to see as school group. Teacher cried. Students wanted to cry too because we wanted out."

3h 58min Drama, History, Romance melodrama.Gone With the Wind. My new number 1 Greatest American Movie (followed by The Godfather, Ben-Hur , Casablanca, Taxi Driver, Star Wars , Citizen Kane , Rebecca).""Gone With the Wind"" presents a sentimental view of the Civil War, in which the ""Old South"" takes the place of Camelot and the war was fought not so much to defeat the Confederacy; as to give Miss Scarlett O'Hara her comeuppance. The tainted nostalgia comes with the territory. Yet as ""GWTW"" approaches its 81th anniversary, it is still a towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well.Vivien Leigh stars as Scarlett O'Hara. In Gone with the Wind, She is always after something. She is fiery, stubborn, beautiful, and selfish, and won a Best Actress Oscar for her portrayal. When Scarlett O'Hara raises her fist to the sky and vows never to be hungry again, not only do we believe her, we understand her. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett , is one of greatest , most moving and varied , performance I've ever seen on the screen. A touchstone of great melodramatic acting. Rhett Butler is played by Clark Gable, a mustached, cocky, manly actor. Although Scarlett is the center of the film, Gable's intensity matches Leigh's. His ego seems to be competing with hers, physically wrestling hers on the screen. Their energy and passion rise up to meet the gigantic film. The supporting characters are lovely, too, especially Oscar winner Hattie McDaniel as Scarlett's Mammy. She steals every scene she's in with her explosive line readings, and her compassion.
five-time Oscar nominee Olivia de Havilland's performance as the moral fiber of society, was absolutely compelling and as beautiful as see is.Tremendously impressive cinematic experience. From the amazing performances to Fleming's incredible direction and awe-inspiring images and music. This is a film that deserves to be experienced. A time-tested favorite,""Gone With the Wind"" 10/10Trivia about Gone With the Wind:The four principal stars were billed in this order: Clark Gable, followed by Leslie Howard (as Scarlett's obsessive love, the glum Ashley Wilkes) and Olivia de Havilland (as sweet Melanie Wilkes, Ashley's cousin), and then Vivien Leigh last with ""...and presenting"" -- that is, until she won the Oscar and it was changed to ""starring.""The film (originally rough-cut at 6 hours in length) was challenging in its making, due to its controversial subject matter (including rape, drunkenness, moral dissipation and adultery) and its epic qualities, with more than 50 speaking roles and 2,400 extras.Adjusted for inflation, no movie can match the $3.7 billion haul that Gone with the Wind's $390 million box-office receipts since its 1939 release would be worth in today's dollars. The film currently remains the box-office (Champ). Yes More Than #2. 1. Avengers: Endgame (2019). Box office: $2.796 billion.A nationwide casting search for an actress to play the Southern belle Scarlett resulted in the hiring of young British actress Vivien Leigh, although over 30 other well-known actresses had been tested or considered including: Katharine Hepburn, Miriam Hopkins, Susan Hayward, Loretta Young, Carole Lombard, Paulette Goddard, Margaret Sullavan, Barbara Stanwyck, Joan Crawford, Norma Shearer, Lana Turner, Joan Bennett, Mae West, Tallulah Bankhead, Jean Arthur, and Lucille Ball. In all, 1,400 actresses were interviewed for the part of Scarlett O'Hara, and 400 performed audition-readings. Although MGM star Clark Gable was expected to play the role of the dashing Charlestonian war profiteer Rhett Butler, Errol Flynn, Ronald Colman, and Gary Cooper were also considered for the part.The landmark film received tremendous accolades, more than any previous films to date: thirteen nominations and eight (competitive) Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director (Victor Fleming - the only credited director), Best Actress (Vivien Leigh), a posthumous Best Screenplay (Sidney Howard, along with collaborative assistance from Edwin Justin Mayer, John Van Druten, Ben Hecht, F. Scott Fitzgerald, and Jo Swerling) - the first post-humous winner of its kind, Best Color Cinematography, Best Interior Decoration, Best Film Editing, and Best Supporting Actress (Hattie McDaniel - the first time an African-American had been nominated and honored) and two honorary plaques, one for production designer William Cameron Menzies for the ""use of color for the enhancement of dramatic mood,"" and the other a technical production award for Don Musgrave for ""pioneering in the use of coordinated equipment.""Many of the five nominations that lost were unexpected: Best Actor (Clark Gable who lost to Robert Donat for Goodbye, Mr. Chips), Best Supporting Actress (Olivia de Havilland who was competing against co-star Hattie McDaniel), Best Sound Recording, Best Original Score (Max Steiner), and Best Special Effects. Its record of a total of ten Academy Awards wins held firm until 1959, when Ben-Hur (1959) won eleven Oscars. It was phenomenal that Gone With the Wind did so well, given that 1939 boasted some of the greatest American films ever made, including Ninotchka, The Wizard of Oz, Wuthering Heights, Mr. Smith Goes to Washington, Goodbye, Mr. Chips, and Stagecoach."
catherinewilliamss,"Dec 13, 2022",10/10,"Gone With the Wind is a title that has been stuck in the back of my mind for as long as I can remember, although I had never watched it until recently. I had preconceived notions of the film, I thought that it would be not only incredibly boring but ignorantly racist as well. And while I cannot deny the obvious romanticism of the Civil War era that was not historically accurate, a product of its time, this movie was anything but boring. For a film made in 1939, the visual and performance aspects of the movie are incredibly impressive. Vivian Leigh's performance as Scarlett radiated off the screen to depict the vivacious, determined and selfish southern belle, whose disillusionment of love and greed is what led her throughout the movie. This performance is just simply unparalleled even today. Gone With the Wind's ability to stay relevant and the highest grossing film in 2022 is extremely impressive."
mpfeffer82,"Feb 13, 2003",7/10,"This is an obvious classic. But, what makes this movie so ""classic""? Nostalgia? High production cost? Popularity?...Personally, I would agree that the *first half* of this movie is excellent. However, I totally lost the point of the movie around the start of the second half. Tragedy after tragedy and annoying character behaviors are enough to drive a person mad.Basically, if you are going to watch this movie, be aware that what you see in the second half of the movie will not nearly equal the brilliance of the preceding half. It is worth checking out, but personally, I believe that this movie does not live up to the image that people built it up to be in my mind. But, its a ""classic"". Just leave it at that."
BusGrat,"Jan 4, 2008",1/10,"Wow. This was a bad movie. I can't believe this is one of the ""best"" movies of all time. I always had my reservations about David O. Selznick and now that I have seen his epic ""masterpiece,"" I can see his fingerprints all over Rebecca. I am a huge fan of Hitchcock and always wondered how much he was overruled in the making of that film. I will wonder no more. I can't imagine why anyone would like this melodrama. I laughed more than I have at some comedies. I could not keep a straight face as the movie Scarlett argued with Mammy to make her green velvet dress. I was taken back to Carol Burnett's fantastic portrayal of Scarlett walking down the stairs with a curtain rod stuck in her dress. I can't say much for the acting, Leigh and Gable left much to be desired. Hattie McDaniel was great, besides the other African Americans that made up the cast, that was it. The only good thing about this movie was that it gave African Americans speaking parts and was one of the only post code films in the late 30's the 40's and much of the 50's that was shown in the South that gave African Americans speaking parts and showed them in the movie. Many films of this time did not. I would not recommend this movie to ANYONE!"
vitaleralphlouis,"Jul 21, 2006",10/10,"For decades this picture remained #1 on virtually all lists of the best picture ever made as well as the all time box office champion. Suddenly though, the film's reputation heads South. I won't elaborate on the excellence or entertainment value because whatever I say you already know. GWTW was bounced off the box office list primarily because movie prices are never adjusted to constant dollars, thus the newest pictures always win. When GWTW opened in 1939, the admission price of $1.15 was so severe that some theaters had picket lines of protest. In 1939 a good middle class annual income was $800, so $1.15 was indeed expensive. Compare that to today's $10.50 and you see who wins. As to the film's reputation for excellence, this has been trashed in recent years because (1) the film portrays slaves during the Civil War era --- and this is shocking to the political correctness crowd; (2) the slaves act like slaves rather than acting like Snoop Dogg, Ice T, or even Sidney Poitier; another outrage to liberal censorship. The wacky left American Film Institute has thus dropped America's All Time Great Movie from #1 to it's current standing in the trash heap. Thinking people, however, still appreciate and love this classic. For the record, this picture was intensely popular with Black people when released in 1939, again in 1941, in 1954, in 1961 et cetera."
Texas2SFO,"Jun 10, 2020",10/10,It's not a documentary. It's a campy great classic movie filmed in the 30's. It's fiction. No reason for all this.Terrible what the Academy Awards did to Hattie McDaniel.
joshuafagan-64214,"Sep 24, 2015",10/10,"A movie should not be judged purely on its level of writing skill and overall deftness. For that, we have TV shows, which are more apt for this kind of judging alone based on their lower budgets and overall format. No, a movie should be to a large extent judged on its ability to take your breath away, to leave you as a different person than you were before and make you feel like you've gone on an epic adventure. That is why many of my favorite films of all time are epics.That is why The Wizard of Oz is not on my top 100 movies of all time list and this is. Strangely enough, those two movies form a dichotomy. TWoZ, with its color and fantasy plot, was a harbinger of things to come. This film, which is openly a wistful remembrance of the Antebellum South, was a send-off to the past.Yes, one could consider this film problematic for reasons, particularly racial ones, that I have absolutely no desire to discuss in the content of this review. I will just say that if you are going through movies that are artistic pinnacles yet troublesome when viewed with modern glasses, you could do a lot worse. Check out The Birth of a Nation if you want to see why. Still, say what you want against this movie in that regard.But do concede that viewed from an artistic viewpoint, the viewpoint that I always prefer to talk about a movie from, it is a triumph. A sweaty, bloody, four hour, epic triumph. When I watch this, I feel like I have been given wings and a time machine and told to just go.There is a reason this film has not inspired as much as did The Wizard of Oz. Actually, there are... quite a few reasons for that. But I'm talking about the scale. It's the same reason there are far more Potter wannabes than true LOTR wannabes. Whatever reasons you state, they do make a difference. The Wizard of Oz inspired many light fantasies to come. This didn't directly inspire very many notable films at all (with the notable exception of Barry Lyndon, but i'll talk about that movies creepy similarities to this one when I discuss the former).Combine that with the fact that three-hour-plus epics are as rare as dinosaurs nowadays, and you get a movie that is unique, different, and separated from the culture in which we know live. This fascinates me. Around the two-hour mark, when Scarlet rides off from a burning city, I felt emotions few movies have made me feel. Inspiration via the stunningly shot landscape, the best of many beautiful ones in this movie. A true sense of scale; the movie is only half over, but I get a feeling that I've been through so much already. Change; the winds of such were certainly in this scene. Romantic. Depressing. Hopeful. And wholly cinematic. It is the kind of scene that doesn't exist in film any more. The closest that you get is a television special. And if you can't find the beauty in that, ""Well frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.""The characters are timeless. Clark Gable's Rhett Butler is suave and sophisticated yet fallible. I have seen many failed attempts to show a character like this, so it is refreshing to see it done right. It is like going to the mountains after driving through New Jersey. What so many movies get wrong about these kinds of characters is that they are not just striking and, for lack of a better term, cool. They are that way for a purpose. To use a common and only slightly disconnected example, people would not be such big Han Solo fans if Han was a construction man.Yes, that's more of an aesthetic analysis than a character one. But without aesthetic and presentation, there is nothing to wow our senses as our brain works through the plot of the film. And for this film, there is a lot of plot. What I love about these longer movies is that they don't end on the climax. Many moviegoers nowadays don't have the patience for this technique, but it's one of my favorites. If they made a four hour LOTR movie when it first came out, it would have had The Scouring of the Shire, one of my favorite chapters in it.But it is a good choice from a narrative standpoint as well. A story has five basic stages. Exposition, rising action, climax, falling action, and resolution. Many tales forget the fourth in favor of a snappy resolution. But it is my personal favorite step, one I like to call 'The Hero Goes Home' step. Rarely has it worked as well as it does in Gone With the Wind. You feel the entire plot arc of the main character.Who the main character is deserves special mention in my eyes. It is Scarlett O'Hara, a young Southern belle who has to adapt to a changing social climate. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a female is rare. Even these days, a protagonist in an epic drama who is a villain or anti-hero is rare. Yet this film, released in 1939, not a year known for its liberated climate, had both. I don't know whether to applaud this film or tear down so- called modern film for this. Maybe I should do both. It certainly makes for a more interesting story narratively speaking. Scarlett is, in my opinion, the most interesting of a posse of complex characters.So ends this review. I sincerely hope it did not take you as long to read as it did to watch this movie. Now go forth back into your lives. Because tomorrow is another day."
singureanu_andrei,"Nov 4, 2016",N/A,"In my opinion this is a movie that has them all, a movie that will remain without an equal, even if a lot of time passed since its release.This happened because of the period when the movie was made and shown to the public, an era in which a conservative society was yet far from the atrocities of WW2 and all the new ideas that spread before its end.Is a movie with great pictures, great images, color-full, pictorial while portraying an almost Utopia world, yet an idyllic one, where all the things were settled, time was passing by so slowly and so calm with all the people living and breathing their lives in a breeze of peace.Is a story like no other about the Old South, a story about a certain vision about the world, a vision we may applaud or condemn but nevertheless we should see and understand and we must be glad that we can observe from a distance another vision about living, about society, about human relationships, about master, servants and what can become of them."
ElNapalmo,"Jul 5, 2020",7/10,"1 - I didn't see anyhting wrong with it. Politically correct has gone to the extreme. I have my ideals and convictions, but too much is just too much. This is a movie held as a classic, based on a classic of world literature, telling a fictional story that takes place in a specific era of US history. That's it.2 - The movie is dated. Acting, soundtrack, certain parts of the script; it all may have worked back in 1939. Not anymore.3 - I loved the cinematography and the complexity of the story and the characters. Clark Gable was amazing as the morally ambiguous Rhett Butler. Vivien Leigh was great, though I couldn't feel at times she went OTT, but I guess that's due to the (slightly unnatural) way of acting of the era. The first 90 minutes were a solid 5 stars. Then it started to drag a little bit. The final 30 minutes or so were amazing.Overall conclusion: It's not a perfect movie, dated, a product of its time, but it is a a great movie nonetheless. A classic everyone should watch at least once in the life."
emasterslake,"Mar 7, 2006",7/10,"I kept hearing this was a classic film that did excellent back in 1939.So I watched it, and my gosh it's longer than GodFather or Lord of the Rings.Gone with the Wind is a Drama and Historical Fiction movie.It's taken place during the Civil War. It doesn't feature any battle scenes just focuses on those who aren't fighting in the war.The movie's all about Scralet who's a wealthy girl who'll go through a lot of hard situations through this movie. Including trying to find a life she'll enjoy and a possible love of her life.I'm very surprised that they were able to make a movie like this back then.It's not bad for a Civil War film. Just it's very long to watch.Nothing inappropriate to watch but this movie might bore kids to death.If you like seeing a memorable classic film, then you might like to check this one out. I suggest renting it before buying it.It's different from the other classics."
harry-76,"Aug 3, 2001",1/10,"The facts speak for themselves: a (to date) 62-year-old film; one of the all-time best box office grossers; enjoyed five major theatrical releases, including wide-screen versions; VHS, laser disc, and now DVD transfers--and three major restorations.Folks are still talking about it: debating its value-- agreeing, disagreeing, agreeing in part but taking exceptions... It's quite a work that David O. Selznick and his superb production company fashioned.On the purely technical achievement side, there's almost unanimous consent that the film is a historical milestone. After that, opinions are beginning to vary.There's evidence that some folks today aren't quite as smitten by it as in the 40's through, say, the 60's.  They're beginning to take note of some of the sociological implications, as the narrative is told from the perspective of the land-owner/slave-owner/ruling/upper  class.  The narrative begs the audience to identify and empathize with this aristocratic echelon, and to see the beauty and grace of this society through the land owner's eyes.Well, some folks aren't completely buying that perspective any more. They're starting to think about the sweat, tears, and broken lives upon which this aristocracy has built its so-called genteel world.  They're also beginning to embrace characters and situations untold here -- while applauding such efforts as Alice Randall's 2001 spinoff/parody (""The Wind Done Gone"") to at least help set records straight.Of course, there are many tales told from the perspective of the ruling class, whose power has come from the enslavement and domination of others. So it really depends upon how the viewer tends to see things.  One has a feeling, though, that GWTW will continue to be viewed with an increasingly suspicious eye, as years pass.There's also a feeling that it will remain a ""classic,"" being a genuine marking point in cinematic history as to how films were made.  It's technical influence is still felt today, and many audience members are still captivated by the total sweep and power of its superb production values.So, the Wind's still heartily blowing, and there's every indication it will continue to do so for some time to come."
ThomasGlebe,"Dec 2, 2024",10/10,"""Gone With the Wind"" from 1939, is an extraordinary cinematic masterpiece that has rightfully earned its place as one of the greatest films ever made. Directed by Victor Fleming, this epic historical romance is an adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, and it showcases a remarkable blend of grand storytelling, stunning visuals, and unforgettable performances. The film boasts an outstanding cast, with Vivien Leigh delivering a career-defining performance as the indomitable Scarlett O'Hara, a role that became iconic and cemented her status as one of the greatest actresses of all time. Alongside her, Clark Gable shines as the charismatic and complex Rhett Butler, offering a perfect balance to Scarlett's fiery personality. The supporting cast, including Olivia de Havilland as the warm-hearted Melanie Hamilton, Leslie Howard as the conflicted Ashley Wilkes, and Hattie McDaniel, who made history as the first African-American to win an Oscar for her portrayal of Mammy All contribute significantly to the film's emotional depth and richness. The production is nothing short of magnificent, with the stunning cinematography by Ernest Haller and the lavish set designs creating a visually stunning portrayal of the antebellum South and the Civil War era. The sweeping landscapes and intricate details of the sets transport viewers into a world that feels both grand and intimate. Max Steiner's lush, unforgettable score enhances every moment, perfectly complementing the drama, tension, and romance that unfolds on screen. From the iconic opening title sequence to the emotional conclusion, and everything in between, this is a film that captivates at a deliberate pace with its bold ambition, emotional resonance, and a level of artistry that continues to inspire filmmakers and audiences alike. The film's meticulous attention to detail in every department, from costume design to its epic battle sequences, has made it a true landmark in the history of cinema, leaving an indelible mark on the industry and culture that endures to this day. This is exquisite and magnificent storytelling at its very best, and despite its length, holds one's attention throughout, amazingly some eighty-five years since its release. This basically swept the Oscars and each one was well-deserved. Unforgettable."
chiragrathod09,"Aug 1, 2025",10/10,"Gone with the Wind remains one of Hollywood's most ambitious and iconic cinematic achievements. Directed by Victor Fleming and based on Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, the film captures the grandeur and tragedy of the American South during the Civil War and Reconstruction era.At the heart of the film is Scarlett O'Hara, played brilliantly by Vivien Leigh. Scarlett is a complex and flawed heroine-vain, headstrong, yet undeniably resilient. Her tumultuous relationship with Rhett Butler, portrayed by the charismatic Clark Gable, drives the narrative through its sweeping historical backdrop.The film's production is lavish, with stunning cinematography, costume design, and a hauntingly beautiful score by Max Steiner. The burning of Atlanta remains one of the most breathtaking scenes in classic cinema.However, Gone with the Wind is not without controversy. Its romanticized depiction of the antebellum South and its treatment of slavery have drawn rightful criticism in modern times. While it reflects the attitudes of its era, viewers today must approach it with a critical understanding of its historical context.Gone with the Wind is a masterclass in storytelling-flawed but unforgettable. It's a film that defined an era of filmmaking and continues to provoke conversation over 80 years later."
TheCouchPotato1979,"Sep 7, 2025",10/10,"A true American classic. Cinematic art at its finest and the movie is 86 years old! Some of the way that the scenes were shot were ahead of its time. The special effects used were also ahead of its time.My IMDB rating: 10 out of 10. If you like movies for more then the entertainment value and you watch for the artistic value as well, I recommend watching this movie. Truly one of the best ever made."
richardchatten,"Feb 22, 2025",9/10,"One would have thought that any actress would have leapt at the chance to appear in Technicolor, but as Bette Davis later acknowledged colour in the thirties was still regarded simply as a gimmick and ""only the bad scripts got Technicolor"".It took the commitment to colour on the part of independent producer David Selznick to persuade MGM that it was worth the additional inconvenience and expense to employ Technicolor on 'Gone With the Wind'; whose phenomenal success both critical and commercial played a major role in lending it credibility.However, if I may venture an heretical view, amidst all the Oscars liberally thrown in 'Gone With the Wind's direction the most egregious omission has to be that of Olivia de Havilland as Melanie."
Lukkeren,"Oct 16, 2017",6/10,"OK, just watched this whole movie! One of the only things i can think about it is how extremely long it is! if this movie had been half the time it actually is it probably wouldve been an amazing movie in my opinion! but the length destroys the whole movie! This movie is really not that interesting, with the exception of a very few scenes through it's runtime. It is impressing for its time, that was about the only thing i thought was really strong with this movie. I think this movie is very overappreciated, and trust me, i have done my fair share to understand the love for this movie, but the only thing i can do is to respect the movie, but only because, as i said earlier, it was impressive for it's time. Clark Gable's performance was also something that made this movie a little better, but it was not really anything special with the performance."
ruby-jones2,"Feb 4, 2025",9/10,"Great classic. Scarlett was such a complex character, selfish, spirited, passionate about everything she wants. But in the end you see that Scarlett changes, she learns about communication and respect for all those who love her after she lost everyone who did. Never read the sequel if you read the first one because it isn't a Margaret Mitchell novel and therefor you won't SEE the complexity. Those of you who voted for this movie to have one star, I pity you. You cannot see the complexity or beauty of this wonderful tale or you just didn't see it and decided to vote for a movie you thought would be stupid when in fact it is the most popular civil war movie in history. Please support this movie and give it FAIR votes. It won ten Oscars and has claim to one of the most amazing casts ever so take that into consideration (plus the effort it took) when you give this movie a one/ten. It deserves so much more."
rmckeown,"Dec 17, 2003",1/10,"I gave this film 1/10; I would have scored it a perfect 0 if there was the option.  I'm probably doing the film a disservice given that much, much worse films have been made.  A true reflection of this film would probably be somewhere closer to 4, but I feel an obligation to counterbalance the thousands of perfect 10 scores from people who regard this as a ""timeless classic.""  Anyone who considers Gone With the Wind a timeless classic should ignore the fact the it's an old film highly rated by emperor's-new-clothes types and ask themselves what they would think of a modern equivalent: an extraordinarily overlong film with a meandering, muddled storyline punctuated with cheesy dialog and hammy acting and done on an ""epic"" scale because the budget allows it (It's starting to sound like Titanic! Another zero)."
verrucktcarlos,"Jul 30, 2024",10/10,"I've seen this movie twice already. It is very popular so there's really nothing new I can say.All I know is that it is one of the most powerful and gorgeous movies I have ever seen.From the very beginning this film moves you, the music and the visuals are stunning, and it begins with a text that has one of my favorite phrases of all time ''Look for it only in books, for it is no more than a dream remembered, a Civilization gone with the wind''Just reading that, you know you are in for quite the journey. An 85-year-old film that it is one of the most beautiful I have ever seen. Seriously, the visuals and the costumes in this are unlike anything you've seen.Excellent performances from everyone. Vivien Leigh is unbelievable. The scene when she says ''I'LL NEVER BE HUNGRY AGAIN'' is simply masterful.It is very melodramatic and theatrical, that's not inherently a bad thing, but if you're looking for an extremely serious and realistic film, then this is not for you; there's no denying however that although its style and tone are very dramatic, this movie has tons of heart and soul. It is also 4 hours long, but the runtime is completely justified. This is seriously a true masterpiece of cinema, and it deserves to be ranked even higher than movies above it in the top 250 of IMDB."

JBison06,"Nov 22, 2025",10/10,"Every great film deserves a great opening, and this 1939 epic is no exception. The audience first hears Max Steiner's extraordinary score, then, in gigantic letters, the title ""Gone with the Wind"" scrolls across a gorgeous painting of a pasture during a sunset. After the credits and a brief reminiscence on the Old South, the film fades in on a lovely Southern house called Tara, and the audience meets the spoiled teenager Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). Scarlett ignores the surrounding talk about the possibility of an oncoming war, and she instead chases around Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), who, to her dismay, is engaged to kindhearted Melanie (Olivia de Havilland).""Gone with the Wind"" is a film about pursuing the things that matter, the things that last. When the film begins, Scarlett is an immature young woman who seems to think only about herself and her idealistic image of Ashley. As the effects of the Civil War devastate her homeland, she, with the help of Captain Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), must courageously protect herself and her loved ones. Later, when Butler proposes to her, Scarlett must choose her priorities. All of this makes for an exciting and engrossing epic.Of course, the film has been criticized for its romanticized portrayal of the Confederate South, particularly its depiction of African-Americans. While this is an understandable concern, this assertion overlooks some aspects about the film. Not only is ""Gone with the Wind"" set in the Confederate South, in which slavery was unfortunately common, but it portrays that time and place through the eyes of Scarlett, an idealistic and self-absorbed woman. After the Civil War ruins her homeland, Scarlett looks back on life in the Confederate South with wistfulness because that was where her childhood unfolded, and honestly, she seems to make assumptions about everybody she meets. Yes, the scene in which she slaps housemaid Prissy (Butterfly McQueen) in the face is startling, but does she not also slap Ashley in the face because he would not end his engagement to Melanie?""Gone with the Wind"" is a postcard of the Old South magnified to epic proportions, and with the romanticism comes the assumptions that prevailed during the day. But ""Gone with the Wind"" does not ask us to accept these assumptions; it only asks us to understand the point-of-view of an entire culture that is now... gone with the wind.Furthermore, there are more than a few moments when the film subtly condemns racism. Notice Ashley's pathetic defense of slavery while he balks at the idea of his fellow white soldiers enduring the same treatment; also notice how it is Scarlett, of all people, who remarks at this hypocrisy. And who can forget Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), the maid who is probably the only voice of wisdom in Scarlett's life? McDaniel deservedly won an Academy Award for her performance, the first African-American to do so. The rest of the cast is also excellent, particularly Leigh, Gable, Howard, and de Havilland. So are the cinematography, production design, Steiner's score, and Victor Fleming's direction of the colossal picture.In the end, however, ""Gone with the Wind"" owes most of its success to its exceptional storytelling. Despite its mammoth runtime (nearly four hours), the film hardly ever drags. ""Gone with the Wind"" contains the complex and powerful message that, even if everything else about the world you live in must be discarded, it is still worth fighting for your family's heritage in the hopes that it will still be there tomorrow."
bigticket-36199,"Jul 25, 2025",9/10,"""Gone with the Wind"" is a romantic drama with a powerful historical-war backdrop, based on the 1936 novel by Margaret Mitchell.The story takes us back to 1861, to Tara - a cotton plantation in Georgia - on the eve of the American Civil War. There lives Scarlett O'Hara, a Southern belle surrounded by her family, two sisters, and their slaves. She is the most admired girl in the county, but her heart belongs to Ashley Wilkes - who is soon to marry his cousin, Melanie Hamilton. At the engagement party held the next day at Twelve Oaks, Ashley's estate, Scarlett confesses her love to him but is rejected. Yet, she draws the attention of a mysterious guest - the bold and provocative Rhett Butler. The celebration is interrupted by news of Lincoln's call for volunteers to fight the South, and in a fit of jealousy, Scarlett impulsively accepts a marriage proposal...The Civil War and the Reconstruction Era aren't just a backdrop - they're a tale of loss and transformation. A world of aristocratic Southern ideals crumbles under cannon fire, while pride, jealousy, love, hatred, and control wage a battle far more intimate than any fought on the battlefield.Director Victor Fleming opens the film with fairytale-like visuals of Southern elegance - but as war ravages the land, those images turn to ash and ruin. Mist symbolizes memory, crimson dawns speak of bloodshed and hope, and the silhouetted figures of Scarlett and Rhett against a burning city become iconic emblems of resistance and rebirth.The film's length, perhaps justified by the source material's depth, drags in the second half. Over thirty minutes of melodramatic excess could be trimmed without damaging the story's pace or clarity. The dialogue remains sharp and layered, and the cinematography - with sweeping movements and intimate close-ups - balances historical spectacle and personal drama.Thematically, the film has long faced criticism for romanticizing slavery and portraying ""content"" enslaved characters - even if toned down compared to the novel. These issues demand honest critique, not censorship, as prejudice - racial, ethnic, or religious - still echoes through our modern world.Gender roles are delicately drawn. Rhett is a womanizer who often gets what he wants, while Scarlett is a determined and cunning Southern beauty who refuses to accept submission and uses her charms for gain. One scene, where passion and force collide, is especially troubling today - highlighting the shifting understanding of consent and power. Ironically, at the time, it was Rhett's tears that drew more ire than his aggression.Vivien Leigh embodies Scarlett with charisma, grace, and a striking ferocity. Scarlett is spoiled yet resolute, vain yet vulnerable. Her complexity transcends mere survival - she mocks Southern pride as much as she represents it. Clark Gable, as Rhett Butler, is a pragmatic romantic - a man who knows the game and plays it with flair, but also with aching humanity. Their chemistry is electrifying, their exchanges full of wit and tension.Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes is an educated, melancholic figure - a man stuck between past and future, portrayed with dignity and sorrow. Olivia de Havilland's Melanie is the soul of empathy and poise - some would call her a saintly contrast to Scarlett, but I see her as a moral anchor in inhumane times. Hattie McDaniel's Mammy, in an Oscar-winning performance, brings humor, resolve, and warmth - a moral voice cloaked in sharp wit.The supporting cast is uniformly strong.""Gone with the Wind"" is not immune to criticism, and it shouldn't be. But it pulses with life, cinematic elegance, and a kind of resilient optimism that resists melodramatic excess. Its technical artistry might justify its status as a masterpiece - its themes, however, remain provocatively tangled. I don't presume to judge cultural myths or their time, but rather reflect on them - knowing well the world we live in today."
springfieldrental,"Apr 11, 2024",10/10,"The timing of the release of December 1939's ""Gone With The Wind"" was perfect for inspiring the battered British during the opening year of World War Two. Scarlett O'Hara's physical and mental persistence in the face of near total destruction of her hometown Atlanta and the rebuilding of Tara plantation in Georgia during and after the Civil War became emblematic of what the English faced daily from aerial bombardments in the German Blitz during the summer of 1940 as well as the mounting casualties of its soldiers overseas. The epic film opened in the United Kingdom four months after its premier, and was so popular a number of theaters continued playing the motion picture during the duration of the war.Margaret Mitchell's 1936 novel, 'Gone With The Wind,' about a spoiled daughter of a wealthy southern planation owner, was more than just a simple Civil War story; it reflected on the maturation of a young woman going through harsh wartime conditions and exerting her independence in the process. Mitchell was describing the emerging 'new women' of the 1930s who were gaining increasing confidence in the working world compared to generations before. ""Scarlett O'Hara is not a creature of the 1860s but of the 1930s: a free-spirited, willful modern woman,"" notes film critic Roger Ebert. ""The way was prepared for her by the flappers of Fitzgerald's jazz age, by the bold movie actresses of the period, and by the economic reality of the Depression, which for the first time put lots of women to work outside their homes. She sought to control her economic destiny in the years after the South collapsed, first by planting cotton and later by running a successful lumber business. She was the symbol the nation needed as it headed into World War II; the spiritual sister of Rosie the Riveter.""""Gone With The Wind,"" considered by many as the greatest movie Hollywood has ever produced, is cinema's highest grossing movie (accounting for inflation). It had won more Oscars in the history of the Academy Awards during its release as well as in the next twenty years. The David O. Selznick-produced film continues to enthrall modern day viewers, unfolding stirring scenes of the annihilation of the ante-bellum Southern landscape by Union troops in the midst of a weepy triangular soap opera romance between Scarlett, Rhett Butler and Ashley Wilkes. The movie redefined how screen epics were produced.Mitchell's novel looked at the Southern experience before, during and after the Civil War, creating a buzz in Hollywood even before it was published. Independent producer Selznick paid a record $50,000 for a never before published writer for the book's movie rights. In the next three years, Selznick's pubic relations department spun stories about the progress of one of cinema's most highly-anticipated movie, highlighted by the search of the actress to play Scarlett O'Hara. Over 100 hired talent scouts scoured live theatre stages, drama schools and colleges to search for the 'perfect' lead actress. They interviewed over 1,400 mostly unknown professional and amateur actresses answering the casting call, and flew four hundred to Los Angeles to do a reading. Thirty-one were screen tested, and just two were filmed in Technicolor, Vivien Leigh and Paulette Goddard. The two-year search cost nearly $100,000. Writer Mitchell favored Miriam Hopkins, 37, but she was deemed too old for the role of Scarlett, aged in her early twenties.Selznick leaned towards Goddard, who nearly received the O'Hara role. But her relationship with Charlie Chaplin created some uneasiness, and her New York background went against Southern sentiments. That didn't stop the producer, who had the final say, from considering British Vivien Leigh,a client of his brother Myron, the owner of a talent agency in England. Selznick was impressed by her presence when she attended the filming with her boyfriend, Laurence Olivier, on the MGM Hollywood studio lot to watch a reenactment of the burning of Atlanta. A month later, after a series of screen tests, Selznick rationalized in selecting the British Leigh, stating, ""Scarlett O'Hara's parents were French and Irish. Identically, Miss Leigh's parents are French and Irish."" Once chosen, she along with other major cast members were given multiple voice lessons on how to speak with a Southern accent.The choices for the role of Rhett Butler was much easier. Gary Cooper and Clark Gable were a toss-up, but eventually Cooper admitted he wasn't the bit interested. Upon hearing Gable was Selznick's strong candidate, Cooper predicted the movie ""was going to be the biggest flop in Hollywood history. I'm glad it'll be Gable who's falling flat on his nose, not me."" Gable himself wasn't all that excited about the part either, describing it as a ""woman's picture."" The actor was burned from his previous historical period film, 1937's ""Parnell,"" his biggest movie flop ever. However, the unusually high salary he was paid allowed him to divorce his second wife, Maria Langham, giving her a nice settlement which allowed his marriage to actress Carole Lombard to finally take place. The two wedded in March 1939 during a break in 'Wind's' filming. Later, when his career hit a trough, the re-release of ""Gone With The Wind"" rejuvenated his marquee popularity, with studio offers coming his way again.Actor Leslie Howard was also apathetic about his role as Ashley Wilkes, who marries his first cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland) even though Scarlett wants to ensnare him in her web of love. At 46, he felt he was way too old to play Scarlett's love interest, saying ""I'm not nearly beautiful or young enough for Ashley, and it makes me sick being fixed up to look attractive."" His character, at 21, required him to wear extra make-up and a light brown hairpiece. Selznick persuaded Howard to take the part by making him co-producer for 1939's ""Intermezzo: A Love Story,"" Ingrid Bergman's first Hollywood film. Howard never bothered to read Mitchell's book, describing the novel a ""terrible lot of nonsense.""
""Gone With The Wind"" had as many as eight directors handlng various film crews and scenes, with Victor Fleming pulled off directing MGM's 1939's ""The Wizard of Oz"" to replace George Cukor, the original lead director. Cukor wasn't happy with the constant revisions of Sidney Howard's script after spending nearly two years working on and off the movie. Selznick felt he was too slow filming his scenes after just three weeks and felt he was incapable of handling the sprawling epic scenes. Leigh and de Havilland, who enjoyed working with the nicknamed 'Hollywood's women director,' were devastated by the decision. Cukor continued to coach both actresses behind the scenes, but Fleming directed most of the movie until he relinquished the reins due to exhaustion to Sam Wood. A rejuvenated Fleming later returned to finish the primary filming. Set designer William Menzie was credited as a ""Production Designer"" for both his artistic settings as well as directing the second unit, including scenes of Scarlett returning to Tara during the war. Menzie earned an Honorary Award from the Academy for his use of color to increase the movie's pictorial mood, such as the sunsets highlighting the film's many emotional moments. Stuntman Yakima Canutt directed the sequence of Scarlett and Rhett's daughter little Bonnie falling off her horse and dying. Even Selznick had a hand at directing. The producer also hired more than one cinematographer for ""Gone With The Wind."" First was Lee Garmes, who was released after the first four weeks because his filming was ""too dark,"" according to Selznick. He shot the first third of the film right up to when Melanie has her baby. Ernest Haller and Ray Rennahan then handled the bulky Technicolor cameras Selznick leased, all seven of them, at one time every color camera in Hollywood. The two handled the famous crane shot capturing the mass of Confederate soldiers, half of them prone dummies seen in the frame, who were injured in the rail yard while Scarlett is looking for her family doctor to help Melanie deliver her baby.Before Leigh and Gable were even hired, Selznick's film crew shot the Atlanta burning scene. Decaying old sets sitting on the MGM lot, including the massive wall in 1933's ""King Kong"" as well elaborate but faded sets from 1936's ""The Garden of Allah"" contributed to the mass burning. Los Angeles Fire Department's equipment and personnel were on standby while several stunt people filled in for Gable and Leigh. The forty acre fire blazed so high, towering over 500 feet, Culver City residents jammed telephone lines reporting MGM's studio was burning down. Three 5,000-gallon water tanks doused the flames after the scenes were filmed.""Gone With The Wind"" cost nearly $4 million to produce, the third most expensive film yet, trailing only 1925's ""Ben-Hur"" and Howard Hughes' 1930 ""Hell's Angels."" So taxing was her role, Leigh smoked four packs of cigarettes a day (Gable puffed on three packs daily himself.). Fortunately her first scenes scheduled to be shot were the opening ones where she appeared fresh, wearing a white dress to symbolize her virginity and innocence. Leigh was so visibly worn as the production progressed she needed a break to recuperate. To see how thin Leigh became, house servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel) tightened her corset around her 18-inch waist. In 2001 ""Moulin Rouge!"" Nicole Kidman tried to replicate Leigh's feat on film, only to suffer cracked ribs and sustain internal injuries.At a preview of ""Gone With The Wind"" three months before the official December premier, Selznick decided to show a rough-cut in a Los Angeles theater which happened to be playing Gary Cooper's 1939 ""Beau Geste."" The surprised audience gasped when they saw the opening, and when finished its viewers gave the film a standing ovation. Selznick, in attendance, was described by his biograph."
Pedro_H,"Apr 23, 2003",9/10,"The life and loves of a spoiled Southern rich girl living in fast changing timesHard to know where to start with a film of this sort and this magnitude, other than to say most of the things written about it are true. And given that whole books have been written about it - that is a hell of a lot of things.This David O Selznick produced movie not only became an event, but moved the whole art of cinema up to the level of great literature or painting. Even watching today you cannot help, but marvel at the casting, script or action. Despite what it has been boiled down to by its critics (an overheated civil war romance?), so much happens in this film that you could call it almost an action film.Great work is more about perspiration than inspiration. Here nothing has been left to chance, the leads (Gable and Leigh) are absolutely perfect for their roles - no one could have been better cast. Equally every smaller part has a major talent playing them. This maybe the best cast film of all time. Casting costs would make it impossible today.Yes - it is a woman's picture - and yes again - it has elements of soap opera about it. Watching three hours of anything can be hard work (some TV showings break it in to two parts), but it is well worth it.Despite not being in my own top ten of all time favourite movies (others simply appeal to me more), ignoring what this represents in terms of technical achievement and entertaining the masses/generations would be folly. Like it or not, Gone with the Wind moved the movie making bar up not inches, but whole feet and the cinema industry would be poorer for it never having been made."
chikuzen,"Jan 28, 2007",N/A,"Any number of minor aspects of this 1939 release may seem ""dated"" by today's standards. But not Selznick's terrific sense of drama and certainly not Vivien Leigh's performance. Which seems eternally fresh, surprising, rich and compelling. One of the best times I ever had watching this movie was several years back when it was given a wide re-release and playing at a neighborhood theater on New York's west side. It was a midweek afternoon and a number of African-American schoolgirls had elected to play hooky and see it. They were completely enthralled, and the reason why was Vivien Leigh's Scarlet O'Hara. They were impulsive teenagers, and so was she. In fact Scarlet might best be described as the most formidable impulsive teenager of all time. Can't really be sure how much of the rest of the film got through to these girls, but they cheered Leigh on for whatever it was she wanted to do. And who can blame them?"
off2theraces,"Mar 9, 2025",10/10,"I'm still very shocked that this is an eighty-six year old film. The feminist concepts in the film are very ahead of their time even now.Scarlett's life experience is a lot of trials and tribulations, but it has a kind of persistent spirit to fight with difficulties, and it is this kind of spirit that makes her stand up bravely after being knocked down by difficulties again and again. She has a belief in her heart, it is the land gave her this fearless spirit, Scarlett will be brave to raise her head.At first, I saw this film as a heartbreaking tragedy. But later, I realised that every ordeal Scarlett encountered was her growth, shaping her into the person she is today. So so what, tomorrow is another day."
Ned_And_Shall_Luvz_Filmzsh,"Apr 22, 2020",7/10,"For the time this film with made it is simply brilliant. Although the film is 4 hours, every scene kept me interested. Maybe its the brilliant acting throughout from Scarllett and her sneaky ways or from Red Butcher and his natural charm.Can't help but feel that end feels rushed though, which is why this is a 7 not an 8."
dbborroughs,"Jun 28, 2004",1/10,"I should know I've sunk several relationships simply by saying I found this movie to be funny. I've gotten assaulted by women who've insisted that if I watched this movie with them I wouldn't find it funny.This is a great achievement in all areas of film making, except one, that one is the acting. Never in my life have I witnessed so many good actors and actresses going so far into parody that I'm convulsed with laughter every time I watch their work. If you think I'm joking about how bad the acting is, please tell me one other movie that when spoofed or joked about simply requires the lines from the film to be rendered as in the film to be fall down funny?None.Only Clark Gable gives anything approaching a real performance. If you don't believe me then try behaving as people do in this film and see if you're not viewed as if you've gotten a second head.Of course this film is a classic and I'm in the minority so you probably shouldn't take my word on it."
hunter-642,"Nov 28, 2025",9/10,"I've loved this film (and the novel) since my student days. Its romance, grandeur, and tragedy still dazzle, pulling me back again and again. Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is a force of nature-flawed, fierce, and unforgettable-while Clark Gable's Rhett adds wit and heartbreak to every scene.A classic never goes out of style."
kasegrad,"Nov 29, 2025",10/10,"Gone With the Wind isn't just a movie - it's a piece of cinematic history. From its sweeping score to its unforgettable performances by Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh, the film still holds a kind of grandeur that modern Hollywood just doesn't replicate anymore.The scale, the drama, the emotional weight - it all comes together in a way that makes you understand why this film has endured for generations. The storytelling is rich, the characters are layered, and the visual style (even from 1939!) feels surprisingly epic.And the numbers speak for themselves: over 230 million tickets sold. That makes it the most-watched movie in theater history, by a margin no other film has even come close to. It's the kind of movie that wasn't just seen - it was an event for people across decades.Whether you watch it for the romance, the iconic lines, or the sweeping historical backdrop, Gone With the Wind earns its place as a timeless classic. It's not flawless, but it is unforgettable - and the sheer number of people who've bought a ticket to see it proves that its legacy isn't going anywhere."
lachezarmatneshliev,"Feb 16, 2024",9/10,"Watching now ""Gone With the Wind"" again is captivating for the fearlessness with which Hollywood believe the sublime was possible. A towering landmark of film, quite simply because it tells a good story, and tells it wonderfully well. The vision the power behind bringing Margaret Mitchell's massive account about the South, before and after the Civil War, pays handsomely with the film that Victor Fleming directed. This movie will live forever because it reminds us of how this great nation is first place..!? The main theme of the film is the horrors of war and the idea that both sides suffer , but that is not the only case in ""Gone with the Wind"", the war is just a background... Scarlet lives almost her entire life in an illusion of love which is captivating ..!? The music of Max Steiner puts the right touch behind all that is seen in the movie. One can't conceive another Scarlett O'Hara played by no one, but Vivien Leigh. Her beauty, her sense of timing, her intelligent approach to this role, makes this a hallmark performance. The same thing applies to the Rhett Butler of Clark Gable. No one else comes to mind for playing him with the passion he projects throughout the movie. This is a man's man. Captain Butler was torn between his loyalty to the cause of the South and his sense of decency..!? Admiration to the greatest nation in the world.. An American Nation..!?"
Sleepin_Dragon,"Jan 9, 2026",10/10,"Gone with the Wind remains a spectacle of cinematic brilliance, a film that fully deserves its incredible reputation.This isn't a film you can casually dip into; you need to plan your day around it. I've had shorter work shifts. That said, it's worth every moment of your time.Of course it's an epic, a sweeping romance, but there's far more going on here. There's humour, tragedy, and a constant shift in tone that takes you through a whole range of emotions.I can't help but think about the historical significance of this film. Not just its scale and sheer technical majesty, but its importance during the Second World War. A story about battling adversity would have resonated deeply with audiences at the time. My own grandmother said she saw this film multiple times at the cinema; it signified hope as well as heartbreak.It's also a staggeringly beautiful film to look at. Where do you even begin? The landscapes, the sets, the costumes, the faces - it's a true feast for the senses. The music is incredible too, and feels well ahead of its time.The acting is spellbinding. Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh are outstanding, and their chemistry is undeniable. Leigh, in particular, delivers one of the most iconic performances of all time. Scarlett undergoes a remarkable transformation, and Leigh makes every stage of it feel believable.The dialogue alone is legendary. Few films can boast lines as enduring as ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""That final scene is just as iconic. ""After all, tomorrow is another day."" A powerful line, and one that still sends chills.10/10."
muzotime_UZBEK,"Aug 15, 2025",10/10,"Victor Fleming's ""Gone with the Wind"" is a monumental cinematic achievement that stands as a testament to the golden age of Hollywood. The film is a sprawling, epic romance that immerses viewers in the tumultuous backdrop of the American Civil War and Reconstruction. Its greatest strengths lie in its stunning Technicolor cinematography, which brings the pre-war South to life with a vibrancy rarely seen before, and the iconic performances of its cast. Vivien Leigh's portrayal of the headstrong and complex Scarlett O'Hara is legendary, as is Clark Gable's charismatic and roguish Rhett Butler. The chemistry between them is electric. The film's narrative, while lengthy, is a captivating saga of survival, love, and ambition, weaving personal drama with historical grandeur. Its scale and emotional power remain undiminished by time, solidifying its place as a classic.Critics, both historically and in modern times, have noted the film's technical brilliance, from its groundbreaking use of color to its lavish production design. The performances of Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are almost universally lauded as career-defining. However, it's also widely acknowledged that the film's depiction of the Antebellum South, particularly its romanticized view of slavery and its stereotypical portrayal of Black characters, is deeply problematic and rooted in racist ideology. This aspect of the film is a major point of discussion and criticism today.Is it worth watching? Yes, it is worth watching, but with an important caveat. As a piece of cinematic history, it's essential viewing to understand Hollywood's scale and ambition of the era. However, viewers should watch it with an awareness of its historical context and its deeply flawed, racially insensitive depictions, which are a critical part of its legacy."

It's a love story! Not a war movie. But I watched it anyway.Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a stuck up, beautiful southern bell from Georgia and a gambling captain, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) falls in love with her. Most of the movie is just Scarlett sitting around complaining how she can't marry another woman's husband by the name of Ashley (Leslie Howard). But within the last half hour their child manages to die, they go to Paris, and sit around in a mansion watching Rhett get angry with Scarlett.I know the film was a breakthrough in film. The film does have its upsides. The filming locations selected were dazzling, the recreation of the escape from Atlanta was doen very well and Clark Gable gives off the sense of a true southern gentleman. However, the story focus' way too much on Scarlett and half way through the movie she just is annoying and boring to watch.If you like love story, it isn't bad. For a drama, it is sub par.Gone With The Wind. Starring: Clark Gable, Vivien Liegh, Leslie Howards, Olivia de Havilland, and Thomas Mitchell.3 out of 5 Stars."

isabelsvec,"Sep 23, 2024",8/10,"I was introduced to this film at a young age by my parents. They have always wanted me to be well versed when it comes to classic films, and this film was one I saw many times growing up. As a kid, I never knew about the racist tones in this film, I think I was probably too young to understand. Now, when watching this film on (HBO) Max, there is a disclaimer that states that this film was a product of its time, with a discussion about the negative way it portrayed slaves. I think that this film was a product of its time, and this may be an unpopular opinion, but I think it being a product of it's time is okay. This film is still great and is still a classic, iconic, piece of cinema history. Filmmakers can learn from mistakes of the past, and society can grow and change hopefully for the better. This film needs to be taught and watched so that people can understand why it is controversial.Scarlett O'Hara is the stereotypical Southern Belle, but what makes her stand out is that she is extremely selfish. A lot of people love her, and a lot of people hate her. I feel like I fall somewhere in the middle. Her character definitely makes the film interesting, because you want to see how she will handle certain situations; will she be selfless and do something solely for the sake of another person? Or is there always going to be some sort of selfish anterior motive? The way she treats the slaves that tend to her family is kind of all over the place. She can be very kind to them, but she can also treat them horribly.Even though this film is almost four hours long, I would recommend that people take the time out of their day to watch it. It is literally a piece of history and needs to be understood for what it was. This film has always been controversial, even back in 1939, for the way it depicted Black people and slaves. This film is what it is, there is no changing that."

Prinoth1,"Apr 30, 2023",10/10,I think my biggest enjoyment with this film is the scale. The acting is even my favorite which is shocking considering how good that is too. Clark Gable as Rhett Butler is probably one of the greatest role choices of all time and don't get me started with Vivian Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara. The only criticism I have for this movie is probably how it is a little racist but other than that I can see no flaws. The music is so good I can't even explain it's genius. I haven't read the book by Margaret Mitchell yet but I totally will. I am just sad I couldn't get to it earlier but my point is this will stay down as one of my favorite movies of all time.

Vivien Leigh, Clark Gable, Hattie McDaniel and Olivia De Havilland are all perfectly cast and the supporting players shine also, especially Ona Munson, who played  Belle Watling, the hooker Rhett was friends with. I have to agree that Leslie Howard showed no charisma whatsoever  as Ashley Wilkes. What woman in her right mind would want to be with a dull wet mop like Ashley instead of someone handsome, charismatic and exciting like Rhett Butler?Anyway, a classic on every level. The color and costumes are amazing. Will always be a special movie to me."
mjneu59,"Nov 23, 2010",10/10,"What may be the most famous movie of all time is also one of the more purely entertaining epics ever made, although part of its astonishing longevity is because the film is much more than just another antebellum potboiler. Perhaps the secret to its success can be found in the central quartet of characters: petulant, headstrong Scarlett O'Hara; charming rogue Rhett Butler; and the less colorful but equally complex Ashley Wilkes and Melanie, completing a tangled romantic foursome thrown together and cast apart by chance, destiny, and the fortunes of war. But in the end the film belongs to Scarlett, and her rocky path to maturity, from her old plantation home through the siege of Atlanta to rags and later riches after the Civil War, makes the mammoth four-hour long production pass all too quickly. It's easy to see what made Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel such a hot property at the time: Hollywood in the 1930s shared with the Old South similar ideals of wealth and privilege (and, in the studios, a similar plan of institutionalized slavery), and the film matches the grandeur of its subject by oozing pomp and prestige from every lavish Technicolor frame."
tinydr47,"Jun 4, 2006",4/10,"Before I eviscerate this film, a word in its favor. This is, in many ways, a wonderfully shot movie. It is certainly a masterpiece of Technicolor, with lovely painted backdrops, etc. Much of the acting is, in my opinion, wonderful. Personally I think Scarlett as a character falls a bit flat, but beyond that I have few complaints. Except, perhaps, for the nearly 4 hour running time... but hey, people like an event, I won't knock them for it.That being said, here are a few problems I have with the film: note that some of these objections could easily be answered by turning to the censorship of the period, but I don't see that as much of a response.1. It ""whitewashes"" slavery. From the very beginning the film takes cheap-outs to avoid difficult and real subjects. In the beginning, the overseer's impregnation of the ""white-trash woman"" is clearly a poor substitute for what they're really getting at, the rape of black women. The slaves/servants are portrayed throughout as stupid and or slow, or liars (Prissy for example). Without coming right out and saying it, a later reminiscence on the ""glorious past"" casts slavery in a similar light as Joel Chandler Harris, essentially as ""the laughing times.""2. Misogyny. Scarlett (letter anybody?) seems to make the key mistake of sexual agency, and of not knowing her place. Again and again it is drummed into our heads how ""evil"" she is for conniving to steal other women's men. Again and again it is driven in that women should know their place (Belle for instance, while noble, is clearly a ""fallen woman"" or a ""low woman"" who realizes her position and respects it). Ultimately Scarlett ""must"" pay the price.Sexual violence is also simply passed-over. The build-up to the ""rape"" scene (I'll call it what is so clearly is, non-consensual sex, aka rape) alludes again-and-again to what will come... what with Rhett and his ""if I want to come in, no door will keep me out"" tirade and demonstration. Bam! Kicks down the door. And what is Scarlett's apparent reaction to the morning-after Rhett has drunkenly raped her? Happiness?Again, I laud the film for its technical achievements. However, if you were born post-lib or raised by a feminist in the post Women's Lib years, or perhaps are a History major and not someone simply nostalgically wishing for a past that never existed as portrayed, I would urge a critical eye. I am reminded of a quote from Vincent Canby of the NYT regarding Liliana Cavani's ""The Night Porter"" and I hope my direct reference of the source will suffice for copyright purposes. To butcher his comment somewhat, I have just reviewed ""a piece of junk."""
frankwiener,"Jul 8, 2016",8/10,"Since I initially wrote this review on July 8, 2016, there have been no less than 135 additional user reviews of this film in only three years and six months. Some of these reviews are good and some are terribly written with no actual explanation of the writer's rating or opinion. On the ""helpful"" list, this review appears as ""number 60"", at least at the moment, so I have no idea how any IMDb reader will ever find this addendum. At any rate, if you have any interest in this film, I highly recommend the documentary ""The Making of a Legend: Gone With the Wind"", directed by David Hinton in 1988. It offers a unique glimpse of how a movie is made, not just any movie but an exceptional movie.
I am now writing a separate review of that documentary, which mercifully only runs for about half of the running time of the movie itself. As I state below, my one criticism of the film is its unnecessarily long duration, especially the disappointing second half which fails to sustain the drama and spectacle of the first half.In my view, this movie is primarily about a catastrophic war, specifically the American Civil War, and it illustrates how this war so seriously impacted not only two extended families but an entire region, the American South. It is particularly significant to me that this movie, about the horrors of a major war, was made in 1939, a time when much of the world had already been thrust into another major war, World War II, and when many Americans must have been considering the consequences of our country's potential involvement in that war upon their own lives, upon their own personal situations. The world had become a very frightening place in 1939, and, although the United States had not yet entered the war, many informed, educated Americans must have been very concerned and even anxious about the very real possibility that the raging conflict overseas might one day arrive on their doorstep, including all of the uncertainty, disruption, and physical danger that would inevitably follow.Some viewers may appreciate the love scenes and the soap opera aspects of this cinematic epic, but what I find far more compelling is the dramatic circumstance of the characters who are suddenly immersed, some willingly and others involuntarily, in the middle of the bloodiest and most traumatic war ever to occur on American soil. I agree with other reviewers who wrote that the movie is too long. I believe that at least one hour could have been cut from it without destroying any meaningful continuity. After the explosive action of the first half, the second half appears somewhat anti-climactic and even boring for me.This movie is dominated by the central character of Scarlett O'Hara, so powerfully played by a stunningly beautiful Vivian Leigh. All of the other characters, especially the males, seem to pale in comparison to her with the exception of two of her slaves, played marvelously by Hattie McDaniel and Butterfly McQueen, who both manage to upstage Scarlett herself, which was not an easy feat. I realize that these were indeed tough times for the State of Georgia, and one had to be strong and determined in order to survive in such difficult circumstances, but did Scarlett have to be ruthless to the extent that she would steal her own sister's beau, a man she did not even love but decided to marry only on account of the economic potential of his hardware store, including its promising lumber business? Some may say that she only did this so that Tara could survive. Would that alone justify her callous, almost inhuman, behavior?The scenes of beaten, war ravaged Atlanta are very impressive, especially for their time, and must have been a daunting task for the director, Victor Fleming. Although the music and frequent scenes of blazing sunsets behind dead trees have become clichés in time, I think that they were much more effective before ""Gone With the Wind"" became such a widely familiar cinematic classic to us. In many regards, ""Gone With the Wind"" has become a victim of its own huge success in the way that its most famous scenes, music, and characters have become too familiar to us and the object of constant spoofing, satire, and even derision. What a shame.To me, this is a ""must see film"", not only for Ms. Leigh's remarkable performance but for the historical drama that is so effectively portrayed as the South becomes tragically victimized by the very war that many had initially glorified so unrealistically. The reality of war's horror, conveyed so convincingly in this film, is its most important message. A world in a state of peace and prosperity must never be taken for granted. No one would agree with this more than Scarlett O'Hara herself, a casualty of a major conflict that she never wanted in the first place. Of course, Ms. O'Hara would never allow herself to be victimized by anything or anyone for very long. In any case, ""she's not going to worry about that today. She'll worry about that tomorrow."""
mireyaromero,"Mar 16, 2022",10/10,One of my top 5 favorite movies of all time.Recently purchased the digital format to stream for convenience. The only negative thing I have to say is really the preface added in by iTunes. They felt the need to point out the apparent badness of slavery as if the watcher is so ignorant they wouldn't know otherwise.The movie itself is a masterpiece.
Joseph-9,"Aug 3, 1998",N/A,"Easily the best film ever made, even in today's standards it holds up, beautifully shot, acted to a T, it has the best performance coming from Ms. Vivien Leigh, a true triumph. Some of the most commonly used lines used today come from this film, and also some of the most memorable lines, I mean who doesn't know the line, ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn."" very taboo for that time... I mean come on, give me any movie and I will show you in every way this film is better and highly superio, the only films I could think that would come close would be Evita, On Golden Pond, and West Side Story."

thedriver829,"Jul 23, 2024",6/10,"OVERVIEW
Gone With The Wind is considered by many to be one of the greatest films of all time. It is the highest grossing movie of all time when adjusted for inflation, won ten academy awards including Best Picture, and has appeared on several Best-Of-All-Time lists. However, in recent years, particularly with the growth of the Black Lives Matter movement, Gone With The Wind has received a lot of controversy for its depiction of the South and slavery in a positive light. I eventually got the opportunity to watch it, and I can say that I agree with those sentiments, because while Gone With The Wind is a beautiful movie, there are a lot of things that keep me from outright loving it.SYNOPSIS
Gone With The Wind is set in the Civil War-era South and follows Scarlett O'Hara, daughter of a Georgia Plantation owner, and her romantic pursuits, namely with gambler Rhett Butler.THE GOOD
The production for this movie is outstanding. The sets, use of color, and cinematography are a wonder to the eye and really make this story feel larger than life. The score is also fantastic.Clark Gable is so charismatic as Rhett Butler. He is a cool, know-it-all kind of character who also has a great story arc from beginning to end. Many of the performances in this movie are really good, even if I'm not a fan of the character itself (we'll get to that in a moment).The second half of the movie is really interesting to watch as we see how life changes for everyone. We see the change in attitudes and motivations, and the drama that takes place between the characters keeps you invested the whole time.THE BAD
As I said, this movie has a lot of problematic moments throughout, specifically with its portrayal of the South and slavery. The South is portrayed as this beautiful land that is stripped away and reduced to desolation by the Union armies, and the ending even seems to suggest a return to the old ways of life in the South, which is really uncomfortable to think about.On top of that, all of the black characters, with the possible exception of Mammy (portrayed by Hattie McDaniel, who became the first African American to win an Oscar), are portrayed as stereotypical or foolish, and all of them are portrayed as being complicit and comfortable being servants. The film essentially ignores the truth about the horrors of slavery and paints the South as a beautiful place where Master and Slave are happy in the positions they are in.Finally, I have to be honest and say that I do not like Scarlett O'Hara. I know this is probably the intention of the story, but O'Hara is a manipulative, gold-digging brat throughout the story. I thought at one point near the end of the first half that she was going to grow into a more mature and kind woman, but as the story went along she gets worse and worse. Not only is she horrible to her own family members, she's horrible to her husband and her child. She's a character who I found myself hating more and more as the movie went on.OVERALL
Gone With The Wind is a beautiful looking movie. It has great production value, strong performances, and excellent cinematography. It even has a gripping story, particularly in the final half. But its depictions of the Confederacy, the South, and slavery just leaves a bad taste in my mouth, and the story is weighed down by an unlikeable protagonist. It's not a movie that I feel obligated to watch again, but I will give it credit where credit is due: I have not been able to stop thinking about it since I watched it. Good or bad, it definitely deserves to be recognized for that."
dougandwin,"Sep 17, 2004",10/10,"So much has been written about this film, that was made so many years ago, and that in itself should show just how great it was. Brilliantly cast and photographed, it still stands very high among the best films ever made. Sure there was a huge amount of publicity for it when first released, but it was well merited. Just look at the cast - Vivien Leigh was the ideal choice and if you care to think about today's actresses, who could play the role better? Clark Gable was ideal as Rhett Butler and by today's standards, maybe a bit over the top in some scenes, but still excellent. Melanie, a very difficult part was played to perfection by Olivia de Havilland, while Hattie McDaniel's Mammy was brilliant. You can go through the whole cast and rate them so high. The story was very well done, and the settings of the old South were brilliantly captured. See it for what it was, in its day, and glory in the result."
ldneath,"Mar 14, 2023",10/10,"There is a lot a shouldn't like about gone with the wind. I'm not a fan of period films, I don't like films about war, and I am certainly not drawn to anything made pre-1970's.However, I watched Gone with the Wind as a child and I remembered being in total awe. I hadn't watched for years when I decided to watch it again, and I had exactly the same reaction. It just takes your breath away. The scenery, the dialogue, the pettiness and heroism of Scarlett. It takes you through every possible emotion and at the end just when you think it will will wrap up in a lovely bow, it pull the metaphorical rug from under you again and frankly leaves you giving a damn."
jellopuke,"Sep 3, 2022",9/10,"This is possibly the peak of the studio style factory system of Hollywood with a strong willed producer forcing a huge project into existence. Selznick picked, hired, and fired so many people, put up lots of money, and made sure that a huge book was put on screen properly. Everything looks amazing with great technicolor and settings, even though the period was still color in its infancy.The acting is top notch although Butterfly McQueen is a massive annoyance every time she speaks. Leigh is a revelation having to go through so many emotions and not always be likeable.Now as to the historical aspects... yeah there's some stuff here that was out there even for the era. The picture of the south is a little too rosy and the attempts to sweep the horrors of slavery under the rug are off putting, but darn it all, the movie is sweeping, huge, epic, and well worth watching."
ldeangelis-75708,"May 5, 2023",10/10,"There's not much to say that hasn't already been said, so I'll just say that, though longer than most classic films, no one watching this epic saga of the old South from antebellum to reconstruction days will ever be bored!Who else but Vivien Leigh can play the heroine-to-end-all-heroines, Scarlett O'Hara? Who else but Clark Gable can play the incomparable Rhett Butler? Could anyone else be Ashley but Leslie Howard, or can you picture anyone but Olivia de Havilland as Melanie? And let's not forget the wonderful Hattie McDaniel as Mammy!I'll bet GWTW is one of the very few pictures where you don't want the classic Hollywood ""happily ever after"" ending, preferring to hear those immortal words: ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn.""No one can watch this movie and not give a damn!"
Sir-Final_Thoughts-No_Review,"Sep 1, 2022",10/10,"What else can be said about Gone With The Wind that hasn't already been said? Every bit the towering, sweeping epic it is lauded as. No faults in my opinion, dated but has stood the test of time and can hold its own in any era. There is much sadness and grief in this movie, but the good outweighs the bad.There are count em' 6 Academy Award winners hiding here including the director Victor Fleming for this very film, a lasting masterpiece. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable carrying alot of weight in ultra demanding roles, no slouches in the cast here every actor and actress is brilliant.The color especially in a remastered version like I watched is absolutely stunning and crisp for a 1939 film (tip of the hat to Wizard Of Oz too) a true highlight. Many memorable film lines that are engraved in history sprinkled with comedic one-liners perfect for a quick laugh.Believe you me it is a long 4 hours especially made longer with extended stand still periods of the Overture, Intermission and Exit Music but its certainly one of those movies that reward you for having the endurance to last that long. Its not boring by any means despite what you may have heard and is watchable again and again if you have 4 hrs to burn. Loved this movie! A timeless classic."
alekspredator87,"Jun 19, 2023",10/10,"Gone with the Wind in 1939 is one of the most famous films in the history of cinema. Probably, everyone knows this classic. The picture leaves an unforgettable impression and makes the viewer think about many things. The film, which managed to win 8 Oscars, including the main awards for best film, best director, best adapted screenplay and a number of others.The picture presented the audience with the magnificent acting works of one of the most recognizable duets on the screen - Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, who played Scarlett O'Hara and Rhett Butler. The story immerses the viewer in the era of the American Civil War and makes the main characters live their whole lives, feel all their emotions and feelings.The role of Scarlett O'Hara went to Vivien Leigh, who played her so flawlessly that she received praise from Margaret Mitchell herself, the author of the novel on the basis of which the film was created. However, the search for a suitable actress for this role was not easy. David O. Selznick was looking for candidates among many famous actresses, but they were all rejected. He kept looking until he found Vivien Leigh, then a little-known actress. Selznick recalls how Vivien looked at him provocatively from under her hat, and he realized that she was the perfect choice for the role of Scarlett.Some bosses who financed the film did not agree to the participation of an unknown actress in the project, but Selznick insisted on his own. As a result, Vivien Leigh became Scarlett O'Hara, and her acting was amazing. She embodied the image of the heroine so naturally and truly that she became the only true candidate for this role.Lee and Butler generate some kind of flawless chemistry on the screen. Their characters, sometimes so close, but more often absolutely unsuitable for each other, are forced to watch with interest the development of these relationships. Scarlett and Rhett have some common features, but she constantly lacks his foresight, sparkling humor (which is necessarily accompanied by a slightly malicious smile) and the ability to admit her mistakes. Rhett knows how to see through people, is always able to distinguish when a person is cowardly, and when he retreats reasonably, respects courage and does not accept recklessness, respects sincerity and does not tolerate greed. He observes from the side how fake people, surrounded by deception, find themselves in a whirlpool of dangerous events, where their lies turn into serious consequences.Rhett is far from stupid social norms, openly laughs in the face of old aristocrats and calmly smuggles through the blockade, earning money from it. He knows that society does not honor him, considers him a selfish and cynical person. But Rhett has seen enough to understand for himself that all these assessments are not important to him. He just appreciates honesty and true authenticity in people.Wars rarely leave good people alive, and after that the world lives in a new society. Scarlett from the first frames of this story presented herself as a greedy and capricious person, and the war aggravated these qualities. After the war, she changes noticeably, becoming envious and sometimes hypocritical, she is an egoist with a capital letter, a calculating person with a good share of cruelty. It seems that she has even learned to hate, and her rare acts of kindness are done either out of envy, or out of spite at all, or out of hot hatred for those for whom she does it. Yes. Once she sincerely loved: her dad, Tara, her daughter and even Ashley, but that girl left forever under the weight of her fate. In the finale, as I see it, Scarlett did not feel a shadow of remorse and love, she was rather not in love with Butler, but obsessed with his love for herself.Among the many interesting and notable characters in the picture there is a black nanny Scarlett - Mammy. It is simple and reliable, like the earth, and its naturalness is difficult to convey on the screen. Actress Hattie McDaniel coped with this task at the highest level and was awarded an Oscar in the Best Supporting Actress category, becoming the first black actress to receive this prestigious award. However, due to racial prejudice, she was not allowed to attend the award ceremony, which shows that even at that time discrimination was evident.In the story of ""Gone with the Wind"" we will meet many characters, each of which carries its own meaning and evokes different emotions in the audience. Some deserve admiration, some deserve contempt, some deserve respect, and some deserve pity. The ending of this story leaves a lot of space for reflection and discussion, causing controversy around the world for decades. But it is precisely in this uncertainty that the denouement lies: Scarlett, realizing the true value of life and realizing that she needs Rhett, tries to get him back. Whether she succeeds is up to each viewer to decide for himself. After all, as Scarlett herself knows, tomorrow will be a completely different day, and everything can change.10 out of 10."
Slut,"Aug 7, 1998",N/A,"Easily the best motion picture of the 20th Century.  The best performance coming from Vivien Leigh, as the conceited, selfish, money-grubbing Katie Scarlett O'Hara.  Clark Gable and the rest of the supporting cast also give fine performances.  It is long, but it's worth every minute.  The re -release gave us a chance to let us see it how it was meant to be seen.  Beautiful sharp Technicolor, glorious score, etc. etc.  I hope this movie will remain for ever for future generations to see.  A truly captivating Motion Picture.~Peter Fox, DrkSlrMerc@aol.com"
joshuadrake-91275,"Sep 16, 2015",9/10,"GONE WITH THE WIND is a classic film. The plot is set against the backdrop of white Southerners and against the 19th-century American South, it tells the story of Scarlett O'Hara, the strong-willed daughter of a Georgia plantation owner, from her romantic pursuit of Ashley Wilkes, who is married to his cousin, Melanie Hamilton, to her marriage to Rhett Butler.Because the film is 4 hours and 18 minutes long, it is split into two parts. My mother has seen it and I have not seen this film at all, but this is the longest film ever made to win Best Picture, but was also the first movie in color.This film was nominated for 13 Academy Award nominations including: Best Picture, Best Actress, Best Supporting Actress, Best Director, Best Screenplay, Best Cinematography, Best Art Direction and Best Editing and it won eight in the process. This film is just iconic and memorable.Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh and the rest of the cast in this film are incredible and their performances are good and the screenwriters stay true to the book, but a lot of people complained about the very long run time, but I don't have a problem with the film.This film is remembered in today's popular culture and it's production has also been remembered today as well. It has been referenced, satirized, analyzed and dramatized and this film is just amazing and the poster of the film depicting Clark Gable and Vivien Leigh's characters embracing in a scene from the film is one of the greatest movie posters I ever seen in my life and I like the poster.Overall, GONE WITH THE WIND is simply a classic. There is no other way to describe this film and it is an absolute smash hit. 10/10."
barleeku,"Jan 29, 2005",6/10,"Okay, I know it's supposed to be one of the all time epic movie masterpieces, but is it really that good? I'll give the characters a two-dimensionality - barely - but they all play through to type. You can argue it doesn't matter with this movie, that film doesn't have the same responsibility as a novel to explore the nuances of its characters' emotions. But if a film is going to make a claim to be one of the greatest all time, it should show some greater development than Scarlett turning into a spunky survivor. Ultimately, I know the movie is beautifully done with many wonderful scenes, but it's an exercise in sentimental glorification of a world that was far more brutal, ugly, and hollow than the film even hints at. I don't expect a cinematic monograph on the evils of plantation society from a 1939 Hollywood epic, but I also don't have to swallow its assumptions wholesale. The gentility moaning away on their soulless spirituals recalls the ""pastoral scene of the gallant south"" that Billie Holiday sang of in her anti-lynching song, ""Strange Fruit"". The irony is that the lynchings didn't simply date from the Civil War era in which the film takes place, but from the very year and decade in which the film was made and released. So sorry, I give it a 6 for all it does so well, but thematically it has aged very poorly."
Hank482001,"Dec 7, 2001",1/10,"This movie is on every single list of the greatest movies ever, and I'll never understand why. Conversely, Citizen Kane is also on every one of those lists and certainly deserves to be. So many truly great movies both from here and abroad, old and new, and this tired old warhorse continues to get accolades.

Xophianic,"Feb 2, 2000",8/10,"I didn't really think Gone with the Wind was as great as everyone says it is. Granted, I am a teenager and I do tend to enjoy modern movies a bit more than older ones, but I love movies of all kinds. I did enjoy Gone with the Wind, but it was entirely too long, and it left me bored at times.The acting was OK. I don't think it was anything to get in a big fuss about, but it wasn't so bad. The scenery was pretty cool, especially the mansion. I found the characters to be, for the most part, annoying. Scarlett was a first-class sl*t if you as me. She would marry man after man just to serve her own purposes, often involving revenge or money. She struck me as a leech in this way, and her screeching voice tended to get on my nerves. Brett seemed like a jerk, but at least he was a first-class jerk. I found it very funny when he would try so hard to get Scarlet to admit that she loved him, and when she finally let her feelings out, he'd call her stupid. The black-stereotype servants also were a little annoying, though funny for the most part.I did like the movie, even though I speak bad of it. The storyline was good and it was interesting to watch Scarlett go change from the hopeful romantic that she started as to a very different woman. I just don't think this movie is as great as everyone says it is."

MattBrady099,"Mar 3, 2015",10/10,"Rhett Butler: ""Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn"". I love that line.The story is about a spoiled Southern girl's hopeless love for a married man. Producer David O. Selznick managed to expand this concept, and Margaret Mitchell's best-selling novel, into nearly four hours' worth of screen time, on a then-astronomical 3.7- million-dollar budget, creating what would become one of the most beloved movies of all time. Gone With the Wind opens in April of 1861, at the palatial Southern estate of Tara, where Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) hears that her casual beau Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) plans to marry ""mealy mouthed"" Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Despite warnings from her father (Thomas Mitchell) and her faithful servant Mammy (Hattie McDaniel), Scarlett intends to throw herself at Ashley at an upcoming barbecue at Twelve Oaks.Just like I said in my Chinatown review about checking out beloved classic like well Chinatown and some other movies as well. I have decided to take a break from the new movies that I couldn't give a crap about and I have no interest in them but as a reviewer myself that I force myself to do because that's how much I care about you all, your the reader reading this, before I got zone likes, but now I got you all and I'm very to be alive to review probably the best I've seen since...well since I'm been doing this.This is my first time ever that I've seen Vivien Leigh in and I know it's not the last, because she give such a Oscar worthy performance and- oh wait she already won a Oscar for this movie and for once the Oscars got it right. Vivien Leigh give such a excellent performance and she played the spoiled brat that at the first I hated and then later on her character completely changed and for incredible reason that are both hash but just how life works, and she nailed that perfectly.Now what the Oscars didn't get right is not letting Clark Gable take home gold for his outstanding performance in this movie. Hands down the best character in this whole movie was Rhett Butler, he had the best lines, every time he was on screen I was glued to it and he has a sick sense of humor that most people have, even me.The cinematography in this movie....wow just wow, that's what I call a beautiful sunset in every scene to end the day. There never was a scene in this movie that I thought it didn't look impressive, even with the scenes of civil war at least it looked good and I know that's not a nice thing to say but hey when a movie looks good it's best to be brought up.The director of the movie Victor Fleming who did The Wizard of Oz in the same year as this, and he directed the movie with skill and passion and it really dose show.Now for problems: ................I don't have any.Overall Gone With the Wind is a three hour perfection of art that isn't you bloated stick in the mood Hollywood film, not with this movie, at least I can look at this and actually call it an Oscar wining cult classic."
canfordcliffs2010,"Jul 8, 2004",N/A,"This is without doubt the greatest film of all time and is a testament to the golden age of cinema. There is a lot of Ibsen in Scarlett O'Hara,you start off hating her but by the end you admire her for her strength,determination and grit. Clark Gable-what can I say,he just IS Rhett Butler.I am a bit confused as to why the film is ""racist"",Mammy is excellent,she is one of the only people who can control Scarlett, the reason the blacks' all seem very happy is that if the film had gone in to what they were feeling the film would have been a good 3 hours longer,it isn't a story about them so they had to be one dimensional. In fact the most racist thing in it is that all Irish people are not drunks,[the book is a worse offender of this]and Gerald is a main part of the story.My favourite bits are the tableaux of the red sky and THAT music, it makes the audience wish they were back in Tara and certainly aids the understanding is Scarlett's affinity with the land, I get goose pimples every time i see it.This is a film with a strong female lead and helped push for more films with a female lead. I would just love to see the 6 hour long version as I feel many important points of the book were missed out and would help the audience to sympathies with scarlett more,e.g. Will,the yankies burning the cotton or the two extra children needed to be supported.Overall excellent [even though I start crying 15minutes in and can't stop until 10 minutes after it has finished!]"
jzappa,"Aug 9, 2007",6/10,"Imagine if Schindler's List was made from the Nazis' point of view, with our sympathy being invested in them. That is my way of describing Gone With the Wind. It's a bona fide epic of absolutely magnificent film-making that, since it can hold its own shockingly well right now in 2007, must've been the holiest of holies in 1939, but it's made from the point of view of the Confederates during the Civil War. Hello. They wanted to perpetuate slavery. This film is an adaptation of a novel that works as propaganda for the wrong people. That's not excusable the way The Godfather is excusable in its glamorization of an organized crime family or Cool Hand Luke's glamorization of prisoners. This film actually makes these slaves look healthy, well-fed and treated with dignity, downplays the wrongful deaths of loyal horses, and treats the South's blind pride and nomadic, Leonine attitude towards anything nonchalantly, like we aren't supposed to analyze it.Somehow, I find myself hopping on the band wagon anyway and finding this film to be great. Margaret Mitchell, though she is the brain behind the film's aforementioned justification of the Confederacy, writes a story with unabashed love and emotion. Eventually, we learn to love these characters as individuals, the drama is constant and affecting, and thus the film overall is a very intense experience. The film's cast is led by the tremendous performance of Vivien Leigh, whose realization of hot-headed, selfish, greedy, impetuous and aggressive Scarlett O'Hara is clearcut and realistic. Hattie McDaniel, who plays the oldest slave who is somehow able to bark orders and take charge in some situations, has riveting moments of her own, especially one near the end that has an almost contemporary feeling in its elusive steadicam shot that loses itself in her gushing monologue. Olivia De Havilland inspires the most emotion from the audience, becoming the sweetest and most compassionate character you could imagine in that particular time and place, almost like an otherworldy personality in that setting.The cinematography, the most staggeringly beautiful thing about the film, is full of beautiful framing, rich colors, and a look as if it were made just this year. There is a scene where Leigh and De Havilland are speaking in a dimly veiled room, and we only see their silhouettes. This is breathtaking film-making for 1939. The music is wonderful and lush, the epitome of a large-canvas orchestral score.However, I could never see this film ever again. The length is not what bothers me, because there are many favorite films of mine that I would not mind any more if they were four hours long, but if the first two hours were as hard to swallow as those of this film, I definitely would. This movie's first half panhandles for our sympathy during scenes of wounded Confederates and weeping townsfolk. It displays a society that was naive, barbaric, and lazy yet arrogant, proud, and melodramatic, two trios of adjectives that are preposterous when hand in hand. However, once the intermission is over, the second half begins, and that is when the film is truly interesting to me. It becomes a saga that could've been set in many different contexts, because the last two hours are all about the individuals themselves and the motives each of them have that tie themselves in knots. The drama then is truly felt by me.Let me finally note that the only older film available in any of the six video stores in Gatlinburg, Tennessee is Gone With the Wind."
coastie-98509,"Nov 15, 2015",9/10,"Gone with the Wind, Margaret Mitchell's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is one of the bestsellers of all time, with at least 28 million copies and more than 155 editions having been published in nearly every language and country. David Selznick's film adaptation, winner of many Oscars, including the first for a black actor, Hattie McDaniel. It was also one of the first major movies to be made in Technicolor, Gone With the Wind is an epic from the golden age of movie-making. Overblown and melodramatic, it somehow achieves more than the sum of its parts, thanks to a spirited modern heroine, the main character Scarlett O'Hara, and its refusal to give us the neat conclusions you'd expect This is a must see for anyone living in the south."
ASIDISJJDSAI,"Oct 16, 2004",6/10,"This movie I believe is very overrated, it is just tooooo long. I first tried to watch the film a couple of months ago on TCM, I watched it for 1 1/2 hours before I gave up. However I seen that it was on again and I just had to watch the full movie because it is so famous and a lot of the people on this website said it was a classic. So this time I didn't find it boring, I found it to be a good movie BUT not a classic, not a masterpiece, and not a rewatchable movie. I might watch this movie again in my life but I'm sure it won't be for a couple of years. I say to all people thinking ""Everyone says how great this movie is, I MUST watch it"", don't, it's not that great.My rating6/10"
Jack-151,"Jan 17, 1999",1/10,"I finally got around to seeing this film in 1995 after putting it off for years.  I assumed I would find it an overblown melodrama, and that it is, but it is far worse than I had expected.This is a racist film. I do not use that term lightly.  I found it offensive, banal, and grossly over-rated."
amyncjwalls,"Mar 17, 2011",9/10,"Gone with the Wind is one of my all time favorite movies. It is a classic story of romance and the struggle of loving and being loved. My mom, sister, and I have watched this countless times together and it never gets old. The movie wouldn't have been successful without its stars. The main characters, Scarlett O'Hara, played by Vivien Leigh, Rhett Butler, played by Clark Gable, make the movie. They fell into the roles as naturally as breathing. The chemistry between the two makes their love story real to the audience. The struggle in the love relationship between Scarlett and Rhett begins when Scarlett is spurned by Ashley Wilkes, played by Leslie Howard, the man she set her sights on to marry. She finds out that he is to marry his cousin Melanie, played by Olivia de Havilland, and Scarlett does not respond well to his rejection. Scarlett is a spoiled belle used to getting her way and she doesn't realize that she and Ashley are not alone in the scene where he rejects her. Rhett is asleep on the couch and awakens when she throws a vase at the wall in anger. From here on, Rhett and Scarlett engage in a game of cat and mouse throughout the movie. There are not many other movies to compare this one to. The only one that I can say even compares would be North and South. It is set during the Civil War, just as Gone with the Wind is. North and South showcases a well-known actor, Patrick Swayze, who plays Orry Main, the main character in the movie. It is a love story that also shows the struggles in life and relationships that people faced during the Civil War, much like Gone with the Wind. I feel that Gone with the Wind is definitely the better movie. Although it came out in 1939, it was way ahead of its time. The way that Tara was portrayed as a mansion, with its expansive lands and cotton fields made me want to live there. The lighting that was used in scenes helped to convey the feeling of the characters. For example, when Scarlett and her sisters had to work the fields, the lighting was dark and dreary. It effectively conveyed the feeling of despair and helplessness that they were all feeling. Another thing I noticed was the camera angles. One particular scene which stuck in my mind was when Scarlett was in Atlanta. You can see the destruction across the city. There are bodies lined up in the streets. The camera pans out and in the corner you see the rebel flag flying. I think that seeing that the flag was still flying after such destruction and loss was amazing. Gone with the Wind is a timeless classic that reassures me that in the worst of times, people still find a way to fight for something they love."
PopcornPlease,"Jan 24, 2025",10/10,"I've read the book and have seen the film several times over the years and to those who whine and complain about it being racist I say: boo hoo. Get over it and get over yourselves. It's an accurate and authentic depiction of what it was like, including the language used, during that era of American history, especially in the treasonous South. The book is writing at its best and the film is exceptionally well done. There are reasons why it won so many well-deserved awards. And so what if both the book and the film are what you consider long. We know your attention span is limited, younger reviewers, but you certainly wouldn't mind the length if it were some mindless comic book superhero movie, would you? (Plus, GWTW was made before CGI.) It's a ten star film and anybody who gives it less is clueless, to say the least. And have you ever noticed how it's always boring people who find everything ""boring""? Perhaps they simply need to up the dosage of their Ritalin and try to focus. Since they never have anything worthwhile and intelligent to contribute, they call everything ""boring."" How lazy and...and...what's the word?... BORING.On an aside, I truly and seriously hope that America has another ""civil war."" The current cult of corrupt criminals, cons, and clowns needs to be cast out once and for all. It's time to restore America to its former glory and not the international embarrassment it now is. Fascism was defeated in the past and it will be again."
patroklosmech,"Feb 12, 2017",9/10,"Having watched it multiple times, I have always admired its colorfulness and its technical excellence.One of the first colored films and certainly in the top color films of the black and white era, that is until the early sixties,it exploits all means to convey the traits of characters most effectively through color. Eye colors, hair colors and clothes are used for that purpose.Its extended use of matte paintings is effectively counterbalanced by their absorption and adjustment with live action footage. Certainly well deserving its Production Design and Cinematography Oscars.An equally well distributed and chosen although not flawless cast choice adds to the result. Gable and Leigh are the only, literally speaking, actors of the era that could convincingly incarnate Scarlett and Rhet Butler, and near their top throne also rests Olivia De Havilland. The main cast suffers mostly from Leslie Howard as Ashley. Though he is convincing as for the mental and intellectual traits of the novel character he lacks physical resemblance and his under- toned and flat performance is somewhat distant from the presence of Ashley in the novel who has a few emotional outbursts. The rest of the cast is magnificently positioned, to mention a few: Thomas Mitchell as Gerald is very suited to the emotional spectrum of his character and I would have wanted him in more scenes which were present in the novel but edited out of the film unfortunately, including one that involves Gerald in Atlanta after the bazaar to reproach his daughter, Barbara O'Neill is physically perfect though limited in stage presence and of course Hattie McDaniel shines as Mammy with the strong character and the tough heart. She is something of an accomplice more to Scarlett than a servant or executor. Also, Laura Hope Crews is satisfactorily presented as Pittypat and not deprived of quantity and quality of scenes. Unfortunately, many other characters omitted, edited out or merged with others from the novel are just a little more than extras, including the terrific Jane Darwell and Leona Roberts whose characters are much more significant in the book.Apart from any above mentioned flaws I credit the production with its departure from Mitchell's descriptions of mansions etc, like Tara or the Twelve Oaks, and the quite limited running time of the film. I think it should be presented as a two 5 hour movies sequence to adequately be faithful to the book. I know this is impossible to have happened back then as neither Cleopatra of 1963 managed to be something that innovative, but I lament because only this specific cast could master the whole novel to perfection with all its nuances, so today the latter is not possible anymore. Nowadays it is feasible to make a TV series of better technical standards but such actors are almost impossible to find today!!!!I refrain from criticizing the racial and sociopolitical stance of the film's depiction of slaves, Reconstruction an such things as it was 1939 back then and the novel remained faithful to the depiction of the characters in the book. It is important to understand that the film wasn't supposed to depict 1861-1871 faithfully and objectively but to adapt for the screen a very specific piece of fiction."
PurpleFilm,"Jul 26, 2016",10/10,"""Gone with the wind"" is the best story - the best book adaptation - the best classic film ever. I first saw it when I was just a kid, and I immediately fell in love with it. I re- watched it millions of times. And I still can't get enough. Scarlet O'Hara is one of the best film/book characters of history as she represents the spoiled flirty Southern Belle that - when in need - can react to destiny and war and fight like a tiger to survive. She is my idol. Strength combined with beauty, passion with a tantrum, shrewdness with sweetness. The only thing I hate about this heroine (apart from basically killing the poor horse when she finally reaches the ruins of Tara) is her blindness: she just cannot recognise Real Love and a Real Man. The book isn't altered too much, but something is different compared to Margaret Mitchell's masterpiece. However, the war and the slavery are well pictured, the intensity of the story and every single character is strong; the setting is just perfect, in particular if we note that this movie was made in 1939! I think ""Gone with the wind"" is the most genuine mix of love story, war narrative, great acting (the charming Rhett Butler played by the superb Clark Gable, the weak Melania played by Olivia de Havilland - the only living actor from this movie) and amazing music scores. It is definitely a must- see and the 220 minutes time just flies."
annavernick-34195,"Jan 2, 2017",10/10,"When I first got this movie, I was a bit skeptical. I'm not a huge fan of war based movies, but I was pleasantly surprised. Gone With the Wind was a beautiful movie that so clearly showed the devastation of the Civil War and how during the Reconstruction the Southerners had to adjust to the abolishment of slavery. Although there are racist undertones and many of the African American characters are stereotypes, one has to take into account the time the movie was filmed and released, and the time it is depicting. The romance element of the movie helps keep it interesting, and the movie perfectly balances romance and the Civil War aspects of the film. All in all, this movie was amazing and I can see how it is one of the greats."
ElliesWonder,"Jul 15, 2017",7/10,"It was a movie filmed on 1939!The costumes, the dresses, the laces, and the architectural style, they are so gorgeous and sophisticated. What an amazing masterpiece! Very dramatic and unpredictable plot.Scarlett is a captivating and attractive character, yet she has an unfortunate life, always losing her loves. However in my opinion, her capricious thoughts also are the factor to lead this tragedy. She is like a spoiled child, always want something she thought should be good, but not really in reality.Beside Scarlet should be blame for keep tempting her friend's husband. Marriage is built on faith and responsibility, being faithful to the other half is an oath under the god and law.Nevertheless, no matter how selfish Scarlet is, I still appreciate her courage, it is amazing to live totally free from heart, and never betray her own wills."
telegonus,"May 14, 2002",10/10,"A long romantic-historical extravaganza, and the crowning glory of 1930's movie-making, the David Selznick Gone With the Wind is worth watching if only for the color and production design. The story is on the soapy side and concerns a Southern belle named Scarlett O'Hara, her obsessions, tribulations, her flaws and her (few) good points. I've never much cared for her character and have never been able to understand why anyone would. She starts out bitchy and ambitious and ends up the same way, only she's been through the Civil War and Reconstruction. Unlike most characters in serious fiction there's no real growth in Scarlett, no understanding, no self-knowledge. Everything's external with her. She learns about life mostly by watching other people fail.Her lover and then husband, Rhett Butler, is a dashing adventurer who understands Scarlett intuitively, and for all his erring ways really cares for her. Why is anyone's guess. They're soul-mates, in a manner of speaking, something he ""gets"" and rather enjoys, and which she never gets, and suffers for. The man she really wants is the one she can't have, the sensitive planter (plant?) aristocrat Ashley Wilkes, who represents the ""best"" of the South. But Ashley is taken with another. I find Scarlett's infatuation with Ashley the most interesting aspect of the film emotionally. It's so complete, so absolute, so crazy and so human, it's wholly believable, and is the one facet of Scarlett's personality that makes her at times touching. Were it not for her passion for Ashley Scarlett would be no more than a garden variety bitch, but on account of him she is an heroic bitch, a larger than life figure, almost awesome in her ferocious appetite for what is basically a fantasy.Gone With the Wind is definitely worth watching. Its Technicolor is remarkable even by today's standards, or maybe I should say especially by today's standards. Color is the one technical aspect of film that hasn't improved over the years. If anything, it's declined. Another glory of this movie is its production values, and for this a tip of the hat to Mr. William Cameron Menzies is in order. Menzies was many things, but is best remembered as a pioneer of motion picture art direction and set design, and Gone With the Wind is a superb example of this, and his crowning achievement. One has to pay close attention to fully appreciate the Menzies touch. Though he did not formally direct the film he essentially storyboarded it, which is half the battle, and one can see his work in the way characters are framed by, among other things, windows, doorways and fences. There's a completeness to this production, down to the smallest detail, that is astonishing. Menzies was also fond of forced perspective, which is the art of making things look longer or larger than they really are.The film is by no means perfect. It's too long, for one thing, and the second half drags. Much of the book and film's success had to do with its appeal to women. This is after all a woman's story, and it's largely told from a woman's perspective. But they might have thrown in something for the boys. There are no real battle scenes. Aside from the burning of Atlanta there's not a lot of action. While there's a good deal of movement in the film,--people do get around from place to place, usually on horseback or by carriage--it would have been nice to have seen them, once they arrive at their destination, do more than talk, argue, scheme and throw themselves down on sofas or across beds. At least the interiors are lush and pleasing to the eye. Another problem with the film is Max Steiner's overused, emphatic theme music. The more modest incidental music Steiner wrote, including some jolly little mood pieces, are quite nice and used far more judiciously. Still and all, there are some striking images in the film: the first glimpse of Tara, the entire barbecue sequence, the burning of Atlanta, the ball where Rhett ""buys"" Scarlett for a dance. Producer Selznick was very careful to stick as close to the novel as possible as much as he could, as he was afraid of alienating the book's millions of readers. Yet this fidelity gives the film an at times episodic quality, and one yearns for it to break free from its shackles and take on more of a life of its own. Even with these shortcomings, there's more than enough life in this movie to go around."
Big S-2,"Nov 12, 1999",1/10,"""Gone With The Wind"" is one of the most overrated movies of all time. It's one of those 'emperor's new clothes' movies (""Citizen Kane"" being another prime example) which has created its own myth and which it seems to have become almost blasphemous to criticise. Call me a Philistine if you like, but to call this load of old toffee the greatest movie of all time - or even one of the greatest - is just plain rubbish. It may have been okay in its day, but now it's just so dated. Clark Gable is nothing more than a kind of proto-Timothy Dalton, and the much lauded Vivienne Leigh is positively hammy all the way through. In parts she's quite nauseating. And those hideous frocks - oh dear me. Big thumbs down I'm afraid."
marvelousgab,"Oct 14, 2020",9/10,This film truly does show the best of American Cinema. It brought together the best people of Hollywood. It is a four hour film that keeps you intrigued the entire time. I truly feel like this movie will always be popular despite the different opinions from the two different factions in the war.
English_Teacher_Matthew,"Jun 30, 2020",9/10,"I really enjoyed this film and found it to be very emotional at times.

Kirpianuscus,"Aug 5, 2020",N/A,"A great film. In 2020 , the motif to define so is not the artistic value, the acting, the cinematography or the story itself. But the profound feeling to be part of its world. Not the romance but the career and lives of actors, the high incorrect policy front to contemporary social movements, the nostalgia, the nuances of dialogue, the death of Miss Olivia de Havilland as end of the circle and the new senses of ""tomorrow"" of Scarlett O Hara Hamilton Buttler are pieces to see it not as a masterpiece - always was so easy to critic and see it more or less between pathetic and kitsch - but as trait of a world who makes it more than a good adaptation but testimony about the spirit , more modern than you expect, of a great form to be yourself. A film becoming, for the future, a sort of manifesto. Courageous and wiseful. So, only""Gone with the Wind"". The same. Because , each time, it must be profound different."
kiradykesky,"Mar 28, 2020",10/10,"The film presents a very unusual love story on the magnificent era picture, creating a love epic film with a real and vast historical background plus a fictional character story. The film retains the charm and depth of Margaret Mitchell's original works, with both colorful scenes and detailed portrayals of the fate of the characters. Whether you think of Shakespeare or vulgar soap opera, the film has achieved amazing artistic achievements. The heroine is not a ""good woman"", but she has the toughness that many men may not have, as if nothing can defeat her. She can always find a fulcrum and stand up again, just as she always remembers in her ""Tomorrow is another"" day ""."
slothropgr,"Mar 22, 2008",2/10,"One of the ways I knew I really did love my wife was that I was able to sit with her all the way through this monstrous tripe. Had tried a couple of times before without success. Afterward we had a big argument about it of course--she was stuck on the hopeless romanticism of the thing which I saw as Grand Ole Soap Opry. Not to mention the simple fact that whether you like it or not, both book and movie glorify the most degrading and longest-lasting oppression visited by one people upon another since The Grandeur That Was Rome. Imagine this story in a more modern context, with Scahlett and her precious crew as Germans in the 1930s and Mammy and her folk as Jews. Somehow I doubt such a movie would've been made. I will allow that the movie unintentionally provides an accurate barometer of the pathetic state of race relations (non-relations?) in pre-WWII America.And oh those AWFUL accents! A Georgian friend of mine thinks the movie was made as an insult to the Old South that no one gets."
catey-40848,"Mar 30, 2015",10/10,"Some of the best moments in GWTW are small ones, some with no dialogue at all. I love the scene where Mammy is trying to get Scarlett to eat her breakfast before the barbecue, and gives her a dig about Ashley not proposing to her. The sideways look of death that Scarlett gives her, and her own smug expression when she knows she's won the exchange...brilliant. Also the scene at the barbecue just after she's overheard the other girls criticizing her, and she slowly climbs up the stairs, completely oblivious to everyone else running down the stairs around her whooping and hollering. And the scene at Aunt Pity's house on Christmas night where Scarlett stands alone at the bottom of the stairs watching Ashley take Melanie to bed was one of the few that made me feel sorry for her."
daoldiges,"Feb 13, 2023",8/10,"I'd heard about the film version of Gone With The Wind long before actually seeing the film, so my first viewing was rather auspicious. Much to my relief it didn't disappoint. The story, the direction, the sets & costumes, along with some very solid performances this film for the most part does deliver a solid, well-turned drama. Yes, it is a long film, and I'm not going to say that it flies by, but simply that it was the length that it needed to be to tell this particular story. For anyone out there who has still not seen this old Hollywood classic, it is definitely time to check it out for yourself and see what you think."
daveisit,"Nov 29, 2000",8/10,"Scarlett O'Hara is an absolute psycho. What a loser. I just can't believe that people liked her. She is a superficial and selfish b**ch.I guess this means Vivien Leigh played the role magnificently. Most of the cast was pretty good, as was the whole film. The major problem was the ridiculous length of ""Gone with the Wind"". After the 150 minute mark of a film, every extra minute contributes to its own self destruction.Overall, 7.5 out of 10. (Would have been higher if it wasn't for the ludicrous 222 minutes)."
dataconflossmoor,"Nov 17, 2007",10/10,"This is perhaps the most classic movie ever made!! ""Gone with the Wind"" is always on every major critic's list of top ten movies in the history of American movie making!! So much of this film became an introduction to an onslaught of numerous elements of creativity to the American cinema!! ""Gone With The Wind"" was one the first recognizable color films in Hollywood!! Clark Gable's parting goodbye of ""Frankly my dear, I don't give a damn"" spurred on a nefarious notoriety which correlated to a very real aspect of candid expression!! This quote by Clark Gable has been voted by this website as the most classic line in the history of all movies ever made!! This ending line of his was considered very dare devil back in 1939!! By today's standards, of course, this seems ridiculous!! ""Gone with the Wind"" became a legendary favorite with the movie audience immediately, and it has been an all-time classic ever since!! The epic tale of Sherman's march into Atlanta at the end of the Civil War sparked a precarious nostalgia with the average American in 1939!! Scarlett O'Hara (played by Vivian Leigh) was a fickle and self serving Dixie maiden with a comical resilience!! Clark Gable was the straight forward southern gentleman who had to piece everything together!! Olivia De Havolind played Melanie, the bastion of hope for the faltering south. Lesile Howard played Ashley, Scarlett's true love!! Ashley was the man with whom Scarlett was fixated on!! Such a tale of morose, and flippant, intangibles, became a dramatic aspect to this movie!! This innovative genre easily garnered a positively peculiar camaraderie with the movie audience!! Margaret Mitchell's novel acquired a new found fascination with the American people when it got presented as this spectacular extravaganza of a motion picture!! ""Gone with the Wind"" won for best picture in 1939!! I have not seen ""Gone With The Wind"" in quite some time now, but, I did enjoy the film the last time I viewed it. The cast, the costuming, and the classic lines to this film are all first rate!! If you are interested in seeing one of the all time flicks in movie history, than, it is an absolutely must for you to see this film!!"
ais_film_reviews,"Oct 13, 2006",10/10,"Gone with the wind-the most magnificent movie ever!As probably the greatest fan of this movie, and a Film Studies student with a clear conscious I can assert that Gone With the Wind is a cinematographic masterpiece. It is the legend amongst motion pictures based on Margaret Mitchell's novel produced from the impulsive outbreak of emotions. It's a romanticized depiction of the Civil War from the point of view of a southerner. It is a romance pictured on the war background. It is the story of a Southern belle who changes from a flirtatious, spoiled girl with not a care in the world less then what dress to wear to a hard-working and experienced widow determined to achieve everything she desires. The movie is diary of Scarlett O'Hara's troubles and skirmishes with her friends and lovers. Gone With the wind was Hollywood's most lavish and splendor movie in the 30s. With an excellent crew of stars, such as Vivian Leigh and Clark Gable, it won Oscars and many hearts. If Gone With the Wind was shot in the 21st century it would be the type of movie starring Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie. The Oscar for Best Actress proves that Vivian Leigh did a great job at playing the gorgeous and spectacular character of Scarlett, and while Clark Gable was not singled out with any awards he faithfully represented the rude and gallant Rhett Butler. The movie shocked with it's rich and showy cinematography, 19th century costumes and breath taking details ranging from Scarlett's hairbrushes, through Rhett's shoes covered with Georgia's red dirt to the architecture and design of the plantations. It is no doubt that 67 years a go Victor Fleming directed an American stunning success, which watched every time evokes different emotions and comes back to redeem the good name of melodrama. Therefore, if you haven't seen it yet, what are you waiting for?"
Essential-Films,"Feb 22, 2004",N/A,"""Gone with the Wind"" is definitely one of those films that have time as their best judge. The highest-grossing film of all time, accounts its achievement through its outstanding quality. It is a film that was not made in a rush, one which benefited from the work of one of the best people in their field at the time: Selznick, Fleming, Cukor, Gable, Leigh, Havilland, Steiner - all proving that a masterpiece needs both time and talent to achieve completion.The first thing, which astonishes the viewer, is its sheer vastness. The large landscapes that seem to stretch to eternity are juxtaposed to some telling close-ups, allowing the audience to be absorbed in that era that was gone with the wind.In a period, in which Europe was preparing for war, Selznick was producing a lavish film, which tackled so many sensitive issues at the time, and yet without imposing any particular view. The best way to understand the impartiality is probably by quoting a Yankee woman, from the novel, who after receiving an answer from Scarlett about where to find a good nanny for her children, ends up saying: `I would never allow a black person to take care of my children'. Scarlett has nothing else but conclude that these Yankee's are just ignorant, remembering the soft bosom of Mammy. The main characters are nothing but great supporters of the humanity that lives in the heart of their slaves, as opposed to the liberators who would not bother a lot about the fate of a nation after it's sudden fall.Regardless, of its political difficulties, ""Gone with the Wind"" is a landmark in the history of film. The great performances are probably the main reason why people continue to adore the love story between the dashing Rhett Butler and the beautiful Scarlett O'Hara. Clark Gable has all the charisma and all the charms of Mitchell's character, raging from sheer passion to absolute destruction of the ego. As for Vivien Leigh, there is nothing to be reproached, apart from the fact that she is too beautiful for the characteristics given in the novel. She delivers a truly memorable performance, portraying so clearly the psychological struggle behind her choices. The supporting cast is applaudable: Olivia de Havilland, Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, Thomas Mitchell, Barbara O'Neil give some of their most memorable appearances.And then there is the soundtrack. The main theme is a haunting piece, possibly Steiner's best achievement. The vibration of the sound connects naturally in the masterful cinematographic work of Ernest Haller.""Gone with the Wind"" is probably the definition of what Hollywood can do at its best. A truly magical piece that survives and lingers at our hearts like a newborn baby."
ccthemovieman-1,"Nov 6, 2005",4/10,"As with the headline here, this was ""home run"" with audiences....but it was only a single to me. Maybe just a long fly out. I was greatly disappointing after all the hype that has been generated over the years for this movie.I'm not saying it isn't good, and a true classic. It's just not my cup of tea, as the expression goes.Why? Mainly because the main character, the famous ""Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh). is an extremely annoying woman. She is a spoiled brat who usually gets her way, scheming for this and for that and marrying out of spite, etc. Who wants to watch and listen to this lady WHINE for four hours? Not me.For me, the best parts of the movie were the cinematography and the segments in which Clark Gable tells off the spoiled brat. Gable is the one person who really gives this movie some spark, although Leigh certainly is effective in her role. Leslie Howard plays a nice guy and Olivia de Havilland is about as sweet as you could get.In many respects, this is just one, long soap opera centered around O'Hara's selfishness and the men around her. To be fair, it's a powerful story but one I think is overrated, story-wise, unless you like melodramas."
grigoraaakis-889-295918,"Nov 23, 2023",9/10,"There is so little that can be told about this movie. It is the definition of classic cinema, it's the definition of cinema done right! It was epic,it was crazy,it was excellent. Its plot is so intriguing, it had me fully invested. But the main reason I got so invested were the characters and mostly and first and foremost Scarlett O'Harra. Never have I seen such a well written female protagonist,so human,so real,so determined. So wonderful! Scarlett O'Harra is a female character that today's cinema lacks of,flawed but yet so magnificent! I could not believe I like a movie so old,but they are right when they say old cinema was so good! It's all in the story and the characters, if you succeed in that you can film anything!"
didi-5,"Aug 12, 1999",10/10,"This has to be my number one - sure, it's kitsch in places, sometimes it is like a bad soap, but its tragic, funny, romantic, epic and everything that has already been said.  I think the main four could not have been cast better and were probably giving their best performances (certainly it is on a par with Vivian Leigh's role in Streetcar and DeHavilland's role in Snake Pit).  Wonderful colour, music, atmosphere ... a four hour wallow I'd highly recommend!"
shinmiulim,"Aug 11, 2022",10/10,"This is a classic movie. I always feel sad about their ending. I can't imagine that this is a film before World War II. Although its image quality is not as good as that of the films of the 21st century, its content is very infectious. This is my first film review. I dedicate it to my favorite film -- Gone with the wind."
rookie-8,"Oct 25, 2002",N/A,"I am 24 years of age and I can say that, for the first time in my life, last night, I saw GWTW. Thats right, I had never, ever seen the movie before, not even bits and pieces of it. Oh sure I saw Rhet sweep Scarlett off her feet and up the stairs, but that was about it. I had never seen one of the greatest American classics ever produced, not even a part of it.And would you believe I saw it alone? I have been asked by noit so few a girfriend to watch this movie, romantic and sweepingly epic as it is, but have always declined. Why? Well because I find, in my own point of view, that older romantic movies, just as older horror movies, are just not as effective on me today as they most undoubtedly were on people of that era. So I stayed away from this movie, believing that the hype and over-zelous love for this film would find me far too expectant of it and, thus, far more dissappointed then I should be. I was, however, very much wrong.I don't believe I will give, in any way, a general review of this film. Anyone reading this now knows of the story or has worshipped at its cinematic feet for years. Besides, a text book review, a dateline chronicle of this splendid film would not do it justice. As with great pieces of literature, the beauty lies not in the details but in the emotions garnered from the experience, and GWTW evokes such earth shattering emotions.You may scoff at my assertion that a movie could render upon me such strong emotions, but I feel that anytime an event takes place which alters the types of things that please you, that motivate you, that entertain or touch you in some way, well to me that is and shall always be earth shattering. I remember watching, as a child, JAWS and realizing that I could watch this story for years and years without ever tiring of it. It started a life long fascination with the sea and sharks which has never subsided. I remember being in 7th grade and reading for the first time a book that was a joy to read, a book that was an event at night rather then a burden. After reading, for my class, Lord of the Flies, I continued on, reading Lord of the Rings, and on and on and on after that to the point I find myself now where no night of mine is truly complete until I read a bit. I remember all of these things, and many more that have meant so much to me, and I can easily say that GWTW was one of those watershed moments for me.I want to visit Tara, I want become kismit friends with Rhet Butler, I want to find people in this world who loath Ashley as much as I do, who love and respect Melanie as much as I do, and who lust after, for some reason and not just physically, Scarlett as I find myself doing now. I want to see the old South as it was, with all of its splendor and horror, in slavery, put out upon the curb everyday for all to see. I want to see what the Civil War really looked like and I want to stand, jaw dropped and with a sense of dread, as men from both sides talk of short wars and little bloodshed.Mostly however I want to live the life that Gone with the Wind lays out. I want that life to be my life, if only for a moment, if only as a whisper in the ear of time. This movie made me believe in love, in that unquenchable love that passes all understanding, and made me afraid of it's trappings. I feel, even now, for Rhet Butler, so many years of wasting his love on someone incapable of returning it. I pity now Scarlett, left sobbing on the bottom steps of her gigantic home, loving the man she had just driven away with every pore of her being. I feel for them all as if I had known them myself, greavied with them in moments of lose, and celebrated in moments of triumph.This movie made me feel good, fullfilled, and satisfied completely at the end, so much so that I went to bed as writer, director, and actor, finishing a story I had just watch unfold. Sending Scarlett off to fight for Rhet, leaving Ashely behind to wallow in his own well deserved misery. I watched in my mind as Mammie grew older and more gentle as the years went on and Tara became smaller, yet more open and loving in its old age.I saw all this in my miond only because, as a great novel does, a great poem does, a great prose does, this movie left us all wanting more. Wanting it so much that we would stay awake at night, creating a larger, even grander world then the one we had been allowed to peer into. We needed to create more because 4 hours and 20 some odd years was not enough for us. It was but a taste, one so good we needed to raid the rest.And so will it go. New movies will evoke new emotions and new characters will make me laugh and cry and groan from disapproval, but GWTW will live on in my memory. With other films, they will pass in the halls of my thoughts only when I see them on TV or hear of them from friends, but GWTW will visit those halls from time to time without any pre-announced engagement. It will come in to brighten my day, to promise of something better, and to focus me on the beauties of life and all it has to offer. It is why we stare at the Mona Lisa, listen to Beethoven and Mozart, read Dickens and Shakespeare, and in the end, why we watch GWTW. For it gives us a sense of relief or purpose the likes of whcih nothing else does. For that, for last night, I am grateful for that story."
Systematicer,"Nov 24, 2004",6/10,"It's extremely rare that I'm such that bored of a movie that's that respected and popular (popular in a positive way). So I'm surprised by myself that this movie was so terrible for me. I expected to see a quite good movie (minimum).I think if I had seen it about 2 or 3 years ago it would have been quite entertaining for me. But I have enough of love stories yet. And especially love stories that are told like this. I know this is probably the mother of great love stories and that's why I respect it. But there was NOTHING that I haven't seen yet in other movies. Of course 'Gone with the Wind' inspired a lot of them. But I really have enough of it and that's why I couldn't enjoy the movie.But except of the innovative style it really had a stupid story. It's about 230 minutes long and it didn't happen that much. I hate that Scarlett turns from a hoity-toity Lady into a hard working person WITHOUT A SINGLE COMPLAINT. Suddenly she is leading the family. That wasn't convincing at all. She is in love with Ashley without any reason given. It's just a constant in this movie that you have to accept. She never thinks of NOT loving him. What's so special about this guy? Not convincing at all. You don't get any case history, nothing.Clark Gable's character was SO stereotype. They all were completely stereotype. There was not a single surprising action of any character. You can say that's because this movie was ""copied"" so often. That's half of the truth. It was really boring for me. It wasn't suspenseful, very less action, boring comedy, stereotyped and predictable drama. Romance? - Maybe, but I'm not naive enough to swallow that.Probably an enjoyable and entertaining movie for me as kid, but I'm too old for it now. So also if I didn't feel the greatness of the movie I can accept its greatness. And the visuals are top.6/10 for a non-convincing movie with some admirable aspects."
tavm,"Feb 23, 2014",9/10,"After hearing about this movie for most of my lifetime, I finally watched Gone with the Wind on two DVD discs. It was my watching The Birth of a Nation earlier this month and that it's Black History Month that finally got me to do so. My verdict: I loved it! The story of Scarlett O'Hara and all her trials during and after the Civil War really got to me and her constant pining for Ashley Wilkes and her later relationship with Rhett Butler got me staying for the whole thing in one sitting. Vivien Leigh truly deserved her Oscar for the role of her lifetime. I wasn't so sure about Hattie McDaniel's award until her emotional scene near the end though her role-like many of the other black servant roles in the movie-do strike one of Minstrelsy especially when it came to Butterfly McQueen's. Still, there was some amusing scenes I liked among them like that of Eddie Anderson's-this was before he became well-known as Rochester on ""The Jack Benny Program"" on radio-when trying to catch a chicken! Olivia de Havilland was also fine as Melanie Hamilton and Leslie Howard likewise as Ashley Wilkes. Oh, and Clark Gable was perfect as Rhett Butler! I'll just now say if you hadn't seen Gone with the Wind yet, well, if you're so inclined, just do it! P.S. Since I like to point out when players from my favorite movie, It's a Wonderful Life, are in something else, here it's Thomas Mitchell as Scarlett's father and Ward Bond as a military officer."
sinclair-64549,"Dec 26, 2020",7/10,"It's very difficult for me living in 2020 to watch this movie. It used to be one of my favorites, of course. But given the current climate it's so strange now to see how they romanticized the civil war and slavery. The feelings of black people were totally dismissed. I know, I shouldn't be shocked, this has been true for centuries. I guess it's just finally truly sinking in."
lucilletomincc,"Dec 19, 2015",9/10,"This movie showed the many hardships of the Civil War. For example how much people struggled, and not just the soldiers, but the women who either stayed at home taking care of others or who were working in hospitals at the battlefields. The war was overwhelming for everyone and not just physically but mentally as well. Even though it seemed for them like everything was falling apart, the characters in the movie still found a way to get hope, and manage themselves through these rough times. They show the perfect attitude for the hard and good periods of life. Everyone should take ideas of this great movie. I think this movie is the best classic American history movie ever."
RossRivero99,"Jun 14, 2014",10/10,"Just because the movie was the longest movie that I have ever watched in my entire life doesn't mean that Victor Fleming's Gone with the Wind wasn't a great civil wartime movie. While watching this movie there were a lot and I mean a lot of great performances throughout the entire movie from Clark Gable, Vivien Leigh, Thomas Mitchell, Leslie Howard, Olivia De Havilland, and Hattie McDaniel. Based on the civil war novel by Margaret Mitchell director Victor Fleming and producer David O. Selznick have crafted the masterpiece of the 1930's. If some people never get to see this movie at all they would absolutely regret it because it was just a great movie to begin with."
sododalmasri,"Oct 9, 2021",10/10,"It's one of the best movies I've seen in my life I don't like compliments but it's true.Despite the length of the movie, I enjoyed every minute of it. This movie really raised my standards."
davidmvining,"Mar 10, 2023",10/10,"Now...this is a MOVIE. Huge, sentimental, melodramatic, earnest, detailed, ambitious, impressive, and eager to entertain across four brisk hours, David O. Selznick's Gone with the Wind has dominated the popular cinematic consciousness over the past few decades for a reason. A few reasons, really. Made at the height of Selznick's professional and creative powers, after he had gone independent from RKO and before his obsessive tinkering and control over the people he hired became a detriment, Gone with the Wind was Selznick's biggest, brashest attempt to entertain the masses, hooking onto a popular book and throwing every cinematic tool he had at it until it became the biggest movie of all time.There's an earnestness to the film's portrayal of the Old South evident from its opening text that talks about the time and place as the last vestige of Knights and Chivalry. However, the ""knights"" we see are almost all effeminate dandies with little but big talk to back their assertions that they are much better fighters than the Yankees that they're spoiling to fight (the two exceptions are our two male leads). The ""chivalry"" is these men dropping their woman at a glance from Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) just to jockey over which one of them will get her dessert. Essentially, these opening moments, the first half hour or so of the film, feel like the dream of a woman child where everything is perfect except for one detail: the man she thinks she loves, Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard), doesn't love her and wants to marry his cousin Melanie (Olivia de Havilland). Ashley and Melanie are the two purest individuals in the film, especially Melanie. Ashley is a good, resolute man who has his head on right, especially regarding the South's chances in the upcoming war (he's not aching for it like the younger suiters), and Melanie is so pure and good that she can't ever see Scarlett as the conniving, selfish, and manipulative spoiled rich girl that she really is.O'Hara, daughter of an Irish immigrant played by my favorite character actor of the era, Thomas Mitchell (who is kind of wasted in the relatively small role, to be honest), is really a waste of a human being at the beginning. I read her as being at least partially representative of the Old South in the narrative, and if that's true, then the Old South was a silly, unserious, uncaring, and manipulative. Her only saving graces are that she's pretty (Vivien Leigh was very pretty) and she is the eldest daughter of a wealthy plantation owner. One of the other bits of irony is how the film deals with slavery. It doesn't deal with it much, and it's really a minor point in the film, but slavery is only ever questioned directly once in the film (late in it) but there are a couple of small instances of people, especially the wealthy, older women of the social circle balking at the idea of a charity auction for dancing at a ball might be like slavery. The focus of this film is simply not slavery, but it's another small piece of evidence that there's an ironic effect in how the film is put together, and I really don't think Selznick, noted big-hearted lover of melodrama, really realized was there.Anyway, the core of the film is O'Hara's love of Ashley going completely unrequited while the visitor from Charleston, Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a noted runner of the Union blockade during the war who builds up a huge fortune doing it, falls in love with the woman who's just like him. This plays out against the grand backdrop of the American Civil War. The conflicts of the war itself are never the focus, with the first two years playing out quickly before things turn at the news of Lee's defeat at Gettysburg where anxiety begins to build in the hearts and minds of the planter class of the Old South and their livelihoods, marked over the first two years of the war by some limitation on goods but not a real degradation of their stations, actually do begin to falter. As General William Tecumseh Sherman comes closer, news comes through Ashley on a visit that his men are barefoot and losing, and panic begins to set it, but O'Hara can't leave Atlanta to run back home to the plantation of Tara because Melanie is pregnant and can't move without endangering her own life.O'Hara's growth as a person is most evident here where she has to go from completely relying on the few men left in her life, namely Dr. Meade (Harry Davenport), and rely on herself. Melanie goes into labor as the Confederate troops are beginning to pull out in the face of Sherman's march, and Dr. Meade simply cannot abandon the hundreds and thousands of injured Confederate troops to help with a delivery, so O'Hara with her house servant Prissy (Butterfly McQueen), must do it herself. This leads to recruiting the help of Butler who's in town with his preferred company (prostitutes, but the film can never say it because of the Hays Office), who manages to get the group of women out of town through fire, aggressive scavengers, and special effects. They get back to Tara, they see the damage left by the war on their precious home, Butler runs off to join the army after protesting his love to Scarlett, and Scarlett swears to never go hungry again. Intermission.The second half of the film focuses mainly on Reconstruction and Scarlett's attempts to reclaim the life she had before the war (the war that all of the chivalrous knights who are now dead were demanding, by the way). She's met with obstacles from the state of the land to the new governing bodies demanding large sums of money in taxes to the fact that the one man she knows who could help her, Butler, is in prison as a prisoner of war and has no money. Scarlett makes a rash move and marries the beau of her younger sister, Frank Kennedy (Carroll Nye), who can cover the cost with the proceeds from his new shop in Atlanta. She pushes him around in the marriage, does whatever she needs to in order to survive (including doing business with Union officials), and forces Frank to buy a lumber mill that she heedlessly fills with convicts as workers. Ashley, having been freed from a Union prisoner of war camp, comes in on the deal (because Scarlett wants to keep him close, of course) and offers up the closest the film has to a direct rebuke of slavery by equating the use of the prisoners with the use of slaves. Scarlett dismisses that concern because her family treated slaves pretty well while not caring at all that she's treating these prisoners terribly because Scarlett is, through and through, an awful person.Her reckless disregard for her station leads her into a dangerous situation where she's attacked on the road outside a shanty town, which leads the men in her social circle in Atlanta to lead a raid against the town, burning it down. Once again, these chivalrous knights are thick-headed and prone to outrageous violence at the slightest of pretexts. I am pretty sure that everyone involved with the production saw the act as admirable if misguided, but I find it hard to read the film that way. This, however, leads to Frank's death (her second state as widower, since I've completely skipped over her first marriage which lasts a grand total of about three minutes of screentime), and her freedom to marry Rhett at long last.This final section of the film, about the last hour, is where it becomes most evident that the film is really about trying to cling onto dreams. Scarlett and Rhett are perfect for each other, and there's obviously great love between them. However Scarlett simply will not let go of her love for Ashley despite his obvious devotion to Melanie. He provides Scarlett with what could easily be described as friendly gestures because he's simply a good man who does have affection for the pretty young woman throwing herself at him, but it's obvious that he's devoted to Melanie no matter how he frames it. Scarlett simply won't let go, and despite Rhett throwing his entire fortune at her to make her happy, she won't accept that happiness because it's not the dream she had before the war.What's kind of amazing about the film is that it never drags. It is four hours long, and it simply keeps moving with events, but those events are tightly intertwined with our main character's story. This film becomes a bit more random if Scarlett doesn't somehow represent the Old South because her journey mirrors that of the South from the Antebellum period through the war and into Reconstruction, ultimately losing the dream she had when she realizes its not real and what she could have when she lost herself in her dream. Again, I don't think anyone involved intentionally put this stuff in, the film is simply too earnestly presented in every facet of its cinematic storytelling to convince me of that underlying irony, but the elements are there nonetheless.Gone with the Wind is a huge melodrama that is played to the hilt by everyone involved. Leigh throws herself into Scarlett with complete abandon, playing her big emotions big but providing enough small shows of inner life throughout the film to give Scarlett a deeper life. Gable is a cynical counterpoint to so much that goes on all around him, especially in comparison to Leslie Howard's take on Ashley, and he ends up being the voice of reason as the South begs itself into a war that destroys it. De Havilland probably gives the best performance in the film as Melanie, containing eternal suffering and love through all of the trials and tribulations the two families from rural Georgia face. Hattie McDaniel is mostly a fun presence through the film in the supporting role of Mammy, but she has some very nice moments late in the film where she has to deliver a lot of expository dialogue through tears quite effectively.Gone with the Wind is a grand adventure and melodrama, and it still entertains eighty years later."

jfurst,"Aug 17, 2000",7/10,"It is always a shame not to have grown up with something that is considered a classic.  I can't draw back on my childhood memories of visiting a movie palace and taking in this movie in the time for which it was intended.  I saw this movie for the first time on DVD, remastered in 5.1 dolby digital. It is a beautifully photographed movie, but other than it's historical significance I can find little positive to say about it.  Much like Star Wars for my generation, this movie lives in the glory of its period.The acting was, for the most part, good.  I can't really criticize any of the actors, as they all play their parts well.Much of what makes a movie enjoyable to watch, however, are the characters. When have lead characters been so unlikeable?Scarlett O'Hara may be the least likeable female romantic character ever conceived.  I did not, for one minute, give a damn (no pun intended) about her.  She was whiny, bratty, conceited, and annoying from the first scene. Nowhere in three hours and fifty-two minutes did I find myself with any sympathy for her.  Her epiphany was about three hours too late in the movie for me to even consider.  And the glory of her ancestral home was lost on me.  ""As God is my witness, I'll never go hungry again!"".  Hmmm.  If the purpose of Scarlett was to annoy and alienate the audience, I must say, she was beautifully acted.The altruistic Melanie Wilkes, played convincingly by Olivia de Havilland, was another character I could not bring myself to care about.  Her fragile naivite made her feel weak and stupid to me.  Constantly abused by Scarlett, she never came away from kindness.  What a little angel.  The anti-Scarlett, (and equally extreme in goodness as Scarlett was in whinyness) I found her character ridiculous.  Olivia, in my opinion, was the film's most physically appealing actress.  By far.Hattie McDaniel's character, Mammy was archetypical, but appealing nonetheless.  Her acting was excellent, with well timed deliveries and always an appropriate look of fear on her face.Clark Gable is a charming actor.  I enjoyed his performance.As for the plot, drama, drama, and more drama.  Endless ridiculous drama. This movie is like a realization of Murphy's law.  Everything that could go wrong, does.  Despite the extreme length, the movie moves along fairly briskly.  This is due to the continuous string of tragedies that play out over its course.  Make no mistake, this is a soap opera, in perhaps it's grandest form, but soap opera nonetheless.  Non-stop yelling, whining, death, unhappy marriages, and more death.  I threw up my hands on more than one occasion.  Isn't there a limit on the number of horse-related accidents you can have in one film, no matter the length?  No rest for the weary, let me tell you.Wow, this is sure starting to sound cynical.  I gave the movie 7 out of 10 stars, based solely on a few good performances, the stunning cinematography, and the historical significance.  I can't say I enjoyed the film, and honestly, I don't think I'll ever sit down to watch it again.  But I think everyone should see this film once, simply to make up their own mind on it's value.In sum: a glorious relic from the past that has acquired a sour taste in the present."
Colmo2k4,"Mar 18, 2007",3/10,"I'll freely admit my girlfriend and I have quite different tastes, but we usually both recognise really great films when we see them. This meeting of minds, alas, has not happened for the much-vaunted classic 'Gone with the Wind' - she loves the costumes and Vivien Leigh; I loathe the slave-era nostalgia, weak script, hammy acting, overlong show-time (and I'm a Peter Jackson fan) and above all, Vivien Leigh. Only Clark Gable gives a creditable performance as the charming rogue, Rhett Butler.On the first viewing, the film lost me early on with the depiction of cheerful, singing slaves returning from a day in the fields; it continued to elude me as Scarlett O'Hara, initially portrayed vividly as a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich girl, proceeded through the film to become...well...a spoiled, shrill, ego-centric rich woman. If I ever hear her breathily begin a sentence with ""Oh, Rhett!"" one more time, I think I may scream.For sure the most overrated film in the IMDb top #250 I have seen, more so than Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove, both of which have at least some merit beyond the production values."
robertocacciaglia,"May 14, 2022",10/10,"I am aware there'll be criticism on many accounts, but this is got to be the greatest movie ever made. Actors, story, filmography and musical score are all legendary now. I was 6 when I first saw it at the cinema in the early 60s and I haven't missed any of the several comebacks over the following years until the mid 70s. DVD is a different experience so, if they happen to show it somewhere, don't miss the opportunity."
kystilla,"Jan 3, 2005",10/10,"Gone With the Wind is a story of a love triangle, or more likely a quadrilateral. Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) is a young woman who is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard). The only problem is, that Ashley marries another woman, Melanie Hamilton (Olivia de Havilland). Then there is Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) who is in love with Scarlett and eventually marries her, becoming her third husband. A love quadrilateral begins to develop throughout years.The story itself seems pretty easy and without good actors it would be a lame story. But it sure ain't. Clark Gable is a true 'mysterious man', sort of a macho who is always there when you need him and even if you don't. Vivien Leigh plays very well the development from nice and sweet Scarlett O'Hara to harsh and cold-hearted Scarlett O'Hara Hamilton Kennedy Butler. Olivia de Havilland is then again the soft and loving Melanie who cares for Scarlett and doesn't abandon her. Leslie Howard is a man struggling between Melanie, whom he loves and Scarlett, whom he (probably) desires.The story was simple but played brilliantly. I think that it deserves to be called the top of film history and even the best movie of all times. When watching it you get emotional and want to feel sorry for Scarlett, who is really nothing to be sorry of. I could recommend it for everyone to watch, especially film directors and producers of today. Maybe then we'll have something like it but it is sure that no one will ever make another ""Gone With the Wind""."
TheUnknown837-1,"Dec 31, 2009",10/10,"The history of the cinema is full of monumental achievements coming from directors such as F.W. Murnau, Alfred Hitchcock, Cecil B. DeMille, and Sergio Leone and many of their successes became known as all-time classics. And even among these fabulous titles, there are those so monumental that they tower above even the others in their rank. ""Gone with the Wind"" is one of those pictures. In a way, it's the most important Hollywood movie ever made. Not only is it the most successful movie of all time (in adjusted dollars), but it revolutionized and inspired the world anew with its breathtaking, sweeping power and iconic portrait of the Old South and the Reconstruction, all seen through the eyes of not a man, but a woman, Margaret Mitchell's unforgettable character of Scarlett O'Hara, played unforgettably by Vivien Leigh.""Gone with the Wind"" is a movie about a great many things, but it is really the story of Scarlett. The movie starts in the dawn of the Civil War, when Scarlett was a high-strung sixteen-year-old and follows her experiences through the war, watching people die before her very eyes, and her undying effort to not only survive but to prosper through the Reconstruction of the Old South, a world she shall never see again. The movie is also about her relationship to the charismatic Rhett Butler (Clark Gable) and what evolves into a turbulent love affair.Clark Gable had received top-billing due to his fame, but the movie is about and really works because of the Vivien Leigh character. Vivien Leigh and her enthusiasm and her never-say-die attitude throughout her performance is the cement foundation that keeps this near-four-hour epic fresh and powerful viewing after viewing. I have debated and debated and still not decided who gave the best performance by an actor in a film, but after looking at ""Gone with the Wind"" just once, I knew which *actress* had given the best performance. And that is Vivien Leigh. Leigh simply *is* Scarlett O'Hara, never striking a false note in her performance. At the beginning of the picture, she's only supposed to be sixteen. Leigh was much older than that, but she carries the performance through and convinces us that not only is she sixteen, but that she's maturing throughout the picture. Despite her character's personality and how Victor Fleming wanted her portray Scarlett, Leigh makes us feel for and take side with this spitfire for a role. Because of Vivien Leigh and her energetic, impeccable performance, Scarlett O'Hara became not a snobbish anti-hero of a protagonist, but one of the screen's greatest and most admirable heroines.But I cannot – shall not – leave out Clark Gable. I still don't know which actor gave the best cinematic performance, but Gable's portrait of Rhett Butler in ""Gone with the Wind"" is an undeniable candidate. According to Hollywood lore, Gable did not want to make ""Gone with the Wind"" and did not care for the picture even though it immortalized him. Rumor has it he only did the picture for the paycheck, but he was entirely professional in his work nonetheless. Because of his strong charismatic acting, the Rhett Butler character not only stands out strongly in his early scenes, but by the last third of the picture, the movie is equally about him as well as Scarlett.Powered by the immortalizing performances by Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable, ""Gone with the Wind"" is still a landmark is many other regards. Even though the movie does, in a way, glorify or at least take a sympathetic approach on the Old South, it does it with nobility. It does not make the Old South look like a heaven, but a once peaceful, if corrupt world gone forever. For example, although the O'Hara family owns slaves, they do not treat them as slaves, more as hired servants. Even after the war is over, their slaves return of them. And as for the African Americans in the picture, they have been treated in screenplay and acting honorably. They have to be shown as servants, because unfortunately that's how they were treated back then. But we can see by the Hattie McDaniel performance that the movie knows that despite their treatment, African Americans are human beings themselves and are as infinitely different and equal to everybody else. Apart from this, ""Gone with the Wind"" also stands out because McDaniel became the first African American to not only be nominated for, but win an Academy Award and it was a well-deserved gesture.Although filming ""Gone with the Wind"" may have been as turbulent as Scarlett and Rhett's relationship became, the final product was truly marvelous. Director Fleming and producer David O. Selznick (who naturally watched over the production like a guardian) made ""Gone with the Wind"" one of the most professional-looking and feeling pictures of all time. The scenes of the Civil War through Scarlett's eyes are some of the most powerful, gritty, and moving moments in cinema history including the burning of Atlanta scene in which many Hollywood props of the past were wiped out of existence. And the screenplay is as perfect as they come. The movie runs nearly four hours in length and there's not one scene – not one bit of fat – that feels like it needs to come off. The numerous characters all serve their purpose. And it's just wonderful to look at this picture and pick out familiar supporting role faces such as Olivia de Havilland, Thomas Mithcell, Ward Bond, and Butterfly McQueen.Just about every moment of ""Gone with the Wind"" is an iconic, revolutionary scene. I have seen the picture three times within the past six months and it hasn't shed a bit of power or sweeping authority yet. From its high-spirited opening to its tear-jerking but optimistic end, it is an enthralling cinematic experience. Movies don't get much better than this."

In fact, is it just a drift of civilization? With the spread of civilization, there are countless individuals, a generation, a dream, a lifestyle. It's like facing an ultimate goal-death-whether you choose to live soberly and pessimistically and empty, or leave this ultimate goal to live blindly and actively; after a civilization dies, you choose To live in nostalgia, or to abandon the past and start over."
fernandoschiavi,"Mar 4, 2023",10/10,"Who hasn't heard of ""Gone with the Wind""? Or quoted, even without knowing the origin, one of his famous phrases, such as ""Tomorrow is a new day""? Who doesn't know Tara's musical theme, composed by the brilliant Max Steiner? One of the most interesting questions to ask yourself regarding ""Gone with the Wind"" is: who is the true author of the feature film? Normally, the director is the one to whom we attribute the authorship of a film, its failure or its success. With our film, that wouldn't work. To begin with, ""Gone with the Wind"" was taken over by three directors (the official one, Victor Fleming, and the uncredited George Cukor and Sam Wood) and none of them managed to have enough freedom to give the film their vision of history and their style. This is explained by the fact that producer David O. Selznick is extremely interventionist. Selznick is one of Classic Hollywood's greatest producers. Controlling, a lover of literary adaptations and grandiose productions, he was every filmmaker's nightmare, as he always imposed his will. Selznick is arguably most responsible for the success of ""Gone with the Wind"". He bought the rights to adapt Margaret Mitchell's novel even before it became a bestseller and began production in 1936. It would, however, be unfair to attribute ""Gone with the Wind"" to Selznick alone. William Cameron Menzies, renowned art director, is responsible for the aesthetic conception of the film, as well as for the masterful use of colors, with emphasis on the characteristic saturated red. Menzies was hired by Selznick to storyboard each shot in the film. ""Gone with the Wind"" was one of the first feature films to have each of its sequences planned through the process of storyboarding. Menzies was also important for giving unity to the film, which could have been a mess due to the constant change of directors.From the moment the film adaptation of Margaret Mitchell's novel was announced, there was a massive participation of the American people in the project, such was the popularity of the story. In a national poll conducted at the time, Clark Gable (pictured) was chosen as the public's favorite to embody the protagonist Rhett Butler. The choice of supporting actors took place with a certain ease. Olivia de Havilland, one of the most popular American actresses of the second half of the 1930s, wanted to give her career a new direction and leave aside the roles that made her famous in swashbuckling movies. She was nominated by her sister Joan Fontaine and quickly accepted to be the interpreter of Melanie Wilkes. To play Ashley Wilkes, Selznick wanted none other than Leslie Howard. To participate in the film, the actor demanded that Selznick produce his next film: ""Intermezzo - A Love Story (1939)"". Much more complicated and time-consuming was the choice of the female protagonist, the (anti) heroine Scarlett O'Hara. Several famous names were considered, such as Bette Davis and Paulette Goddard until Vivien Leigh, an unknown actress in the United States, was chosen. A good part of the public negatively reflected the choice of a non-American actress for the role of Scarlett O'Hara. Nowadays, it's almost impossible to think of another actress in the skin of the iconic character.Many problems interfered with the filming of ""Gone with the Wind"". Selznick demanded several changes to the script, which ended up being written by five hands. Pages of the script were even rewritten on the same day of filming. To direct the feature film, the producer invited his friend George Cukor. After some time of filming, Selznick removed him from the production, saying he was not happy with the result. Cukor, known for his sensitive portrayal of the female universe, had a great relationship with Leigh and Havilland, but did not get along with Gable. The actor felt that the director paid much more attention to women. In place of Cukor, who was homosexual, Selznick put Victor Fleming, who had a reputation for sexism, and who was a friend of Gable. Leigh and Havilland hated the new director. After Homeric fights with Leigh, Fleming moved away. Sam Wood was then called in, but Selznick was not happy with the result, being forced to call Fleming back to direct the rest of the main scenes.""Gone with the Wind"" is the only film about the American Civil War that does not have any war scenes. Perhaps that is its fascination, that of showing the suffering and growth of the characters, making the viewer imagine the scenario they are living in, all of this wrapped up in the story of the end of an innocent love and the discovery of a real and lasting love. Mature. At first glance, it may seem like a conventional romance, but behind its seemingly simple love story lies a powerful and unforgettable work. The film, which in 1940 won 10 Oscars, remains the ultimate symbol of overproduction that has withstood time, gaining thousands of admirers each year.Thus, the story differs from several others because it contains elements that can be classified as outside the standards of the schematic script, because here we have characters that are not very romanticized and cannot get along. The plot ""Gone with the Wind"" can be summarized as follows: in the midst of the violent separatist war between the south and north of the USA, young Scarlett never gives up pursuing her dreams and romantic ideals. Ambitious and persistent, she finds herself rejected by the man she claims to love, but her struggle to conquer him goes on, even if she marries out of interest with other men to get what she wants. Several twists and turns will make her and the insistent Rhett have their lives transformed. Both never give up their choices, until some losses make them reflect on what they really want.Hollywood was going through big changes. Strong and determined women were growing and standing out more in cinema, defining and conquering their space. In 1938, Bette Davis in ""Jezebel"" played a woman of great personality, in a film that also takes place during the American Civil War; a role that could be seen as a mold of Scarlett O'Hara. And strength is what Scarlett doesn't lack. With a lot of persistence and courage to face the greatest adversities ahead, Scarlett stands out as the central character of the work. At first spoiled, little by little, with the course of events in the war, she becomes a firm and disguised woman, even capable of making urgent and unexpected decisions, as in the scene where she needs to defend the house from attacks by the Yankees; and a curtain in her hand turns into a persuasion piece. Her relationship with Rhett is at first distant, little by little she acts with him in a self-interested way, until the ""game"" changes, but then it may be too late for her.The public demanded Clark Gable in the role of Rhett. Gable, with his usual cynical air, is perfect in the role. The actor considered this the best performance of his entire career. Rhett Butler, an adventurer with a bad reputation, used to gaming tables and many women at his side, is at heart an understandable and sentimental man; however, he is also very attentive to everything that is happening. The scene in which he suffers a great loss and locks himself in a room is one of the most moving scenes ever shown by cinema. One of the most striking scenes is when he, near the end, sees his beloved Scarlett crying and comforting Ashley, motivating his unexpected final decision. Closing the main trio, he wins honorable mention for the character with the purest heart in the entire history of Hollywood: Melanie Wilkes. Married to the protagonist's great passion and never speaking ill of anyone, Melanie may sound implausible in that universe. However, Olivia de Havilland manages to transform a character that, at first, could sound completely uninteresting, into a pleasant surprise for the production. Still composing its rich panel of characters, mostly determined and striking, we have Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel (Mammy, a key character in the story), Thomas Mitchell (father Gerald O'Hara), Barbara O'Neil (the mother Ellen O'Hara) Ann Rutherford (Carreen O'Hara), Butterfly McQueen (Prissy), Harry Davenport (Dr. Meade), Jane Darwell (Miss Doll). Alicia Rhett (India Wilke), Ward Bond (Tom), among others.The main issue that is currently being raised about the film is the romanticization of the Confederates (slavers of the American South), quite possibly derived from the book on which it is based, since the story is told through the eyes of the southerners. This romanticization has its problems in portraying slaves who are happy to serve and faithful to their masters. It is paradoxical that, even with this idealization, the production is responsible for the first black person to win an Oscar. Hattie McDaniel, the actress who plays Mommy, the slave who practically raised Scarlet, took the statuette at the 1940 ceremony. Americans who supported slavery. Fortunately for the real History, this installment was won (and, from there, the second part of the plot begins).Despite some happy moments and comic relief by some characters, the film is a sad work, carrying behind its intense coloring a set of tragic and bitter situations, culminating in a heartbreaking ending. A classic of classics, ""Gone with the Wind"" is the greatest representative of masterful cinema made in the first half of the 20th century. It is true that the duration of almost four hours of the film can scare and that the second part of the feature is much less interesting than the first. However, the strength of the characters and the beauty of the images - linked to the unforgettable music of Max Steiner - make the task not at all thankless. An insurmountable super show that the wind did not take away."
mls4182,"Mar 6, 2021",10/10,That is how I view it. I watch it for Ms. McDaniel's performance. Her character of Mammy has more brains and heart than the rest of the cast combined. You can't help but respect and adore her. I'm not that interested in the lead characters and their messed up relationship.I don't consider this a historical drama. I view it as the first modern Hollywood epic. I love the photography and I don't view it as an homage to the old south. I think that is only in the eyes of some of its characters.This film has become controversial as of late. We all have our own life experience and perspectives. Above is mine.

I wrote a report about it for history class, which consisted of a few impressions the film indelibly made on my then young mind.The imagery is unforgettable.  The more hi-tech movies get today, GWTW becomes all the more revered, considering what it took to put it on film in 1939.

She is also wearing straw bonnet with a dark peach velvet ribbon.In a subsequent scene between Melanie and Ashley where they are discussing Melanie's joining the family and the fleeting beauty of the southern way of life and, if war comes, it will not matter to their commitment to each other. This is a touching scene; one of a deeper understanding than the superficial one experienced by Scarlett and Ashely.Melanie and her betrothed are standing in front of a curtained window facing each other. The window overlooks the gardens. This is one of the most private moments in the whole movie and quite a contrast to the rest of the movie.Melanie is wearing the same dove gray and white lace costume a straw bonnet with a light maroon gross-grained ribbon."
jfarms1956,"Apr 6, 2013",10/10,"Gone with the Wind is appropriate for those 12 and up. If I could have given the movie a 20 out of 10, I would. 1939 was a golden year for movies with both Gone With the Wind and The Wizard of Oz. Color scenes in Gone with the Wind were hand painted movie frames. The era of royalty and nobility in America gave way after the Civil War to democracy and freedom. Yet, dreams still exist. The number 1 and number 3 movie phrases of all time are in this movie. I for one have used both. Vivien Leigh and Clark Gable are both so good in this film that if all the other characters messed up, they alone would carry the movie. Leslie Howard depicts the nobility and royalty of the South, who, when the war was lost, he too was lost. Clark Gable portrays the ultimate survivor and realist. Vivien Leigh plays a character who is in love with the dream, yet has to become a survivor at great personal cost and learning too late what is truly important to her. The director leaves out one-half of the book. Yet, he produces a wonderful, classic movie. If it weren't for the intermission, the movie would be too long. Everybody should see this movie at least once. I think I have seen this movie more than a dozen times. I fall in love with this movie with each and every showing. Great romantic movie. It was a great day for movie lovers when Margeret Mitchell was on the train and met a book publisher. Gone With The Wind is a story which will shine brightly through the ages."
Bryan-15,"Jul 29, 1998",1/10,"This is probably the cheesiest most melodramatic nonsense to ever appear in the 20th century.  The only thing saving this is the lush photography.  I find the sentimentality stomach churning as well as 3/4 of the dialogue. Clark Gable's presence is stuck up and annoying and he just oozes greed. Vivian Leigh was a nobody when she was cast and remained just that after the movie.  The pacing, even for an old movie, is horrific and insipid. The 4 hr running time is excrutiating even if there's a violent storm outside.  This movie is just too overrated."
heisenberg12,"Mar 6, 2021",10/10,"Even though its age of 80 years can be a turnoff for modern day film watchers compared to the CGI and other technological advancements, GTTW remains a modern marvel. Perhaps the most difficult part of appreciating it is forcing yourself to finally watch it if you haven't already. The anachronistic, outdated romantic love story may not popularly appeal to young audiences of today- that and the approximate four hour runtime, which makes it sound like a chore. That was me.Once I dove into it a few years ago for the first time as an attempt to appreciate both history and film history, I quickly realized why it was so popular. What impressed me the most was how good the cinematography was for a movie from 1939, as well as how believable the dramatization was in bringing to life a love saga from the civil war period.Prior to watching the film, the only learning I ever had on the civil war was based on textbooks and documentaries, most of which were a bore. There are war tales of the great commanders and generals involved, but there was never a colorful depiction of society that humanizes people who lived in that era and what it was like. Of all places, the South was the perfect setting to depict an era in history that was tumultuous, painstaking, unstable, and just like that, gone with the wind.The acting is as good as you can get for an old film period, not just 1939. It's better than any acting I've seen well after 1939 into the proceeding few decades. The directing is crisp, music emotive and epic, and Vivien Leigh's Scarlett is unforgettable. Even not being a big fan of older films, the thing that struck me as the most impressive thing about GWTW was its realistic, historical reconstruction of an era and place in time that is scarcely described throughout history lessons. In doing so, it creates an timeless, artistic display of that time. It's epic and important, there's no denying that."
caitiestair,"Dec 30, 2016",9/10,"¨Gone with the wind¨ takes place in the confederate old south during the civil war. Southern girl Scarlett O'Hara falls in love with Ashley Wilkes, but when she finds out he is engaged to Melanie Hamilton and the war begins , her life begins to fall apartThis is a strong love story between two people during a stressful and dangerous time period to live in, the Civil War era. I think this story strongly shows the true effects of this Civil era and how it affected people's lives during this time.The characters were all well portrayed and well the story goes on, you begin to feel their pains with them. The war is not only involves soldiers of the confederacy and the union in this story, but it involves every single person. There is a lot of fighting in the movie, and a lot of romance. The movie is 4 hours long, which because of the quality of the movie is not difficult to sit through, and is rated G. If there was Pg 13 rating though at the time the movie was made, it probably would have been rated that because of the violence of the war."
Vartiainen,"Jun 24, 2018",8/10,"One of the most well-known films even today. Still the highest-grossing film ever released if you account for inflation. A grand epic about the times of American Civil War and how it affected a group of Southern landed gentry.Starring the indomitable Vivien Leigh as Scarlett O'Hara, the oldest daughter and presumed heir of the Tara plantation, and Clark Gable as Rhett Butler, her on and off mentor slash rival slash romantic interest. The story revolves around Scarlett in the months leading up to the Civil War and in the years that followed. And what a character. Very few movies I've seen in my life I have been able to call Films with a capital F. But this belongs on that elusive list.I find it especially intriguing how jaded they portray Scarlett. She is not a pleasant person, not at all. She's scheming, manipulative, almost purely after her own interest and she most certainly does not take a no for an answer. And yet the scene just before the interlude, where she swears that she and hers shall never suffer like they have suffered, is one of the strongest scenes I've ever see put on film. And the reason for that is the fact that you can understand where she is coming from. Likable she may not be. Admirable, on the other hand, oh so very much.And it's not like she's a pure villain or a monster either. She is not immune to the suffering of others, she is loyal to those she considers hers and her sheer willpower and force of personality are certainly something to be praised.She's also beautifully set up and contrasted by those around her. From Rhett Butler's more relaxed scheming to Melanie's (Olivia de Havilland) straight up sainthood.The only real problem I have with the film is the way it shows its age. More specifically the way it portrays slaves. It is told from the point of view of the South, and it tends to portray slaves as a simpler people, who are being gently looked after by their white masters. More often than not the slaves are shown either as people of limited understanding or as straight up mentally handicapped. It usually isn't the focus of the film, but the story is about the Civil War so it's always on the background. And it is uncomfortable, to tell the truth.Aside from that, the film is really good. A masterpiece. Masterfully acted, masterfully scripted, masterfully made. It is hard to recommend a film almost eighty years old and almost four hours in length to anyone. But in this case I believe the recommendation is more than warranted."

joseph952001,"Apr 12, 2006",7/10,"Yes, I know! Gone With The Wind is considered a classic! The first time I saw Gone With The Wind was when the wide-screens hit the theaters and they had stereophonic sound, and when I saw Gone With The Wind around this time, they advertised the movie would have a stereophonic soundtrack but, of course, it would still be shown in its original screen size. It wasn't until years later that they redid the movie in a sort of 75 mm widescreen process using this earlier stereophonic soundtrack. Very impressive, even though the heads were chopped off, somewhat, in the viewing!Well, poor Katy Scarlett had more twist and turns in her life which equaled the twist and turns of Erica Kane on All My Children, and after almost four hours of Gone With The Wind, what did Scarlett learn? Not a thing! She should have taken the prophetic words of her father when he told her that the only thing that meant anything was Tara and, especially, the land, before she went out chasing after Ashley and Rhett Butler with no success. Vivien Leigh played Scarlett like a grown up Shirley Temple who never grew up, and as far as her southern draw in the film goes, this was no problem. When the English first came to this land, they were up north and up north it gets so cold that they speak rapidly and when they migrated to the south, they spoke very slowly, and all Vivien Leigh did was draw out her English accent which made her sound like she was born and bread in the South! And what was also amusing was that after Vivien Leigh was chose to play Scarlett there were some catty remarks from southern women that at least no Yankee would play Scarlett! Can you just imagine Bette Davis and Errol Flynn playing Scarlett and Rhett?This is probably one of the greatest Soap Opera's ever put on film, and what Acadamy Award Oscar Wining lines?SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! GERALD O'HARA: It's I'm proud to be Irish! SCARLETT: War, war, war! PRISSY: I can berth babies! SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! RHETT: Has the war begun? SCARLETT: Sir, you've no gentleman! BELLE WATLING: It wouldn't be fit-tin'. SCARLETT: Fiddle Dee Dee! MELANIE: Oh, Scarlett, how I envy you! SCARLETT: Oh, Fiddle Dee Dee!SCARLETT: After almost 4 hours in the movie theater: ""Ashley, why didn't you tell me you didn't love me!"" Uh! Pardon me? You mean, after almost 4 hours of movie time, Scarlett didn't know this, and decided, right there on the spot, that she really loved Rhett, but didn't know it? Well, the little user of men's flesh, just couldn't make up her mind, and it's a wonder that at that moment she didn't break into song singing ""I'm Just A Girl Who Cain't Say No!""Now, what puzzles me, and really amuses me, is why any red-headed sexy Sounthern Belle, like Scarlett O'Hara, would want to not trap some handsome man like Rhett Butler who just happens to look like Clark Gable, and not do everything possible to trap him and keep him! Scarlett had to be nuts! Let's face it, Leslie Howard was not that handsome for anyone to want to live with forever, and besides that, he and Melanie were cousins; and they got married? Was Scarlett nuts, or not? Well, maybe a little psycho! Give up Glark Gable?I will, though, admit that the end of the first act where Scarlett vows that her kin-folk, and especially her, will never go hungry again, is a powerful scene and worth sitting through. especially since you're sitting through all the nonsense of her chasing after Ashley, ignoring Rhett, and facing the Yankees in the Civil War, plus Melanies birth of her baby, makes this scene worth it! Of course, Rhett was right when he said, ""God help the Yankees if they ever captured her!""So, when I finally saw the end of the film, I wanted o destroy the projector and the theater for such a silly ending, and there's Scarlett still living in her dream world that she would go back to Tara and think about a way to get Rhett back which at that time was really very unrealistic, but not to Scarlett acting like a grown up Shirley Temple still living on the Good Ship Lollipop! But, at the end, Rhett summed up the whole thing when he said, ""Frankly my dear; I don't give a damn!"" And that's how I felt when I finally got a chance to leave the theater! Of course, before the movie ended, this would have been a great time for Scarlett to break out in song and sing ""The Man That Got Away"", or maybe re title it ""The Men That Got Away""! And, of course, no one would realize that many years later, one of the Tarleton Twins, George Reeves, would end up playing Superman on the television series. He couldn't make it as an actor, but he sure made it to the top playing Superman!Years ago, the British turned ""Gone With The Wind"" into a musical, and Rex Reed panned it and said that it was so bad that at the end of the 1st Act, the horse on stage did something to show what even he, the horse, thought of the production and the 1st Act curtain lowered! Remake ""Gone With The Wind"" today? What a tragedy that would be! Who would they get to play Rhett? Danny DeVito?Now, years later, I have to admit that I do appreciate the movie more than I did years ago seeing it as a teenager, but these very long movies only teach you one thing: When you go to a movie that's going to run for 3 to 4 hours, make sure you take with you, your lunch, a toothbrush, and a fresh change of underwear!"

Scarlett's hopeless love for a married man makes this movie worthwhile. Four whole hours of Scarlett's fight for true love. Even though it's all about Scarlett O'Hara, it still gives appeal to life during the Civil War. Vivien Leigh portrayed Scarlett perfectly and really became Scarlett in this jaw dropping film.

carlianschwartz-03460,"Jun 19, 2016",10/10,"""Gone With the Wind"" is THE American screen masterpiece, even though nearly 77 years have elapsed since its premiere in December 1939. The script, casting, plot, and music are superb.What stands out as something ahead of its time is that the moral center of the story is African- American--""Mammy"" played by Hattie McDaniel. From her initial admonishments to Miss Scarlett not to eat ""like a field hand"" and not to ""show her bosom"" before 5:00 p.m. and throughout the story, she is the voice of common sense and authority on what's ""fittin'"" for any and all occasions. It's little wonder she was the first African-American person to win Best Supporting Actress for this role, and her acceptance speech at the Awards ceremony on February 29, 1940, is a model of tearful modesty.The film was exhaustively researched before production even started. After seeing the latest 2K digital restoration on TCM, I noted that the paisley cotton dress that Scarlett wore when she fled Atlanta with Melanie (Olivia de Havilland), her newborn, and Priss (Butterfly McQueen) was mauve rather than brown. I thought at first that it was an anachronism--mauve was the first totally synthetic dye. However, it was discovered in England in the 1850s and could very well have found itself on a bolt of British cloth that was marketed in the Old Confederacy."

crow_god_sama,"Oct 27, 2003",2/10,"The only and I do mean the only reason why I gave this movie a 2 and not a 1 is because of the most famous line in the movie...you know what it is. Otherwise, I would rather swim in an ice cold pond filled with extremely hungry (insert fish or animal of your choice here).  This title drags on and on and on even more.  After 90 minutes have past you start become one with the movie...but little do you know this is only the beginning of a downhill slope and at the bottom of the hill there are land mines that will explode you into pieces of guilt and shame.  I suggest this title to those who wish to fall asleep."
markan-nikolovski,"Jan 4, 2022",8/10,"Probably the best casting ever for a movie based on book. Actors are amazing in portraying such a complex characters, Gable and Leigh are simply the best. Also, very good choices from filmakers to not include some things in movie that are in book, such as Scarlett's kidds from previous marriages etc. People who didn't read the book seems to don't know how hard is to portray Scarlett O'Hara's character because she's the most narcissistic and most cold-blooded snake even to her kids (and that's one of the reasons why is it so hard to read this book - i mean it's written mostly in first person, from Scarlett's twisted childish mind's perspective) and I can assure you, Vivien Leigh did an amazing job and this is one of the best performances ever, i'm simply stunned. This movie is S tier, my only wish is that never gets a remake."
votarus4,"Feb 23, 2003",10/10,"The creators of WIND did not envision a 65-year life to their work.  Indeed, David O. Selznick sold his interest in the film within years; Margaret Mitchell remarked on publication that she hoped the book would sell a few thousand copies(!).  So it's a huge mistake to judge WIND on any terms but its own -- what it ""was"", and then, what it ""is"".  Today we see a colorful, vividly realized costume epic.  But in 1939, it seemed like the Sistine Chapel had come to life and was appearing at the downtown Rialto.  Forgive the silly metaphor, but you get what I'm after -- the size and scope of WIND on film had no precedent.  Released in the shadow of the Great Depression, WIND in hindsight is less about the Civil War than a nation's slow crawl out of recent poverty.  When Scarlett said `I'll never be hungry again,' the nation rose and said `Damn Right!'  The moment was set to fiery, defiant music, and the illusion of America, as she wanted to see herself, was set. History, right or wrong, was suddenly embodied by a sexy young girl who wants, not just to survive, but to prosper.  Powerful stuff.  But is that enough to hold our attention, year after year, decade after decade?  WIND is still visually persuasive and always will be.  Max Steiner's score beneath those images cannot be underestimated -- there had never been so much music outside the realm of grand opera.  Music completes the illusion.  The script however, full of momentum, has little substance.  It weakens as years go by. Mitchell was no Tolstoy, but her brilliant novel is condensed to a long, shallow, sentimental melodrama.  The writing is redeemed only by two key performances:  Hattie McDaniel, as Mammy, is the first African American allowed to create a real human being on screen (for that we thank David O. Selznick); and of course, Vivien Leigh's complex, amazingly sexual Scarlett. In a strange mix of glamour and guts, the vortex of her acting seems to create the film around her; she wills it to happen.  After 35 years of watching, I've come to regard her as, not merely the leading actress, but the real director of Gone With the Wind -- and the reason to keep watching."
proud_luddite,"Jul 19, 2025",9/10,"The O'Hara and Wilkes families respectively own Tara and Twelve Oaks, neighbouring plantations in Georgia. The lives of some of their family members are highlighted before, during and after the U. S. Civil War. The main characters include Scarlett O'Hara (Vivien Leigh) who is in love with Ashley Wilkes (Leslie Howard) who is engaged to marry his cousin Melanie Hamilton (Olivia De Havilland). One of the many suitors interested in Scarlett include Rhett Butler (Clark Gable), a man of questionable reputation who is a friend of the Wilkes family and lives in Charleston, South Carolina. ""Gone with the Wind"" is based on the novel by Margaret Mitchell.While there is much to praise in this film, it is incomplete due to its exclusion of the perspectives of the black slave characters whose experiences during this history would have been the most profound. Some of the opening text also shows a very outdated nostalgic yearning for the ""gallantry"" of the pre-Civil War Confederacy. History has later shown that some people were definitely not treated with ""gallantry"" during this time period. Nevertheless, the narrow viewpoint of the story is expressed with exceptional film-making that is mostly touching, often inspiring, and always spectacular.The film's first half is better than its second as it contrasts the grandeur of the prosperous plantations at the very beginning (including a large party) with the post-war desolation and poverty that follow. And the war scenes are brilliant and rightly praised among the best in movies.The second half is also good but there are some moments that seem inconsistent and confusing. Still, the many emotional moments in the last half hour were genuine and lead to a grand finale.The acting is great but occasionally some lines are said so quickly, it's difficult to understand what is said. Despite this, praise is still due.Leigh impresses greatly as as someone who is very unlikeable but is also alluring and intriguing. Hattie McDaniel also stands out as Mammy, a character who is strong-minded and good-hearted. And after this viewing (my ninth), I had more appreciation for the performances of Gable and De Havilland.Gable does very well in delivering the film's best lines especially in his ability to see through Scarlett's scheming character. He also shows versatility as Rhett is strong and smart in some scenes while being very vulnerable in others.And in previous viewings, it seemed the character of Melanie was a weak spot as she seemed ""too good"" but in this viewing, it seemed slightly more possible that maybe such goodness is believable. There's also a great scene where Melanie steps out of character and takes full authority when waiting with other women for the men in their inner circle to return from a ""political meeting"".The film's production values are magnificent especially in scenes that show Scarlett's silhouette against a sunset when the iconic theme song is playing - one of those times standing with her father. These are truly ""goosebumps"" moments.This grand movie is well-deserving of its high status.RATING: 9 out of 10OUTSTANDING ACHIEVEMENTS:* Directing by Victor Fleming (credited); and also George Cukor, Sam Wood, and Cameron Menzies (uncredited)* Production Values: Cinematography, Set Design, Costumes, Musical Score, and Film Editingdbamateurcritic."
faith-2,"Sep 12, 1998",N/A,"This is my favorite movie of all time.  I actually sat through it twice at a theatre.  I will never tire of it. Vivien Leigh is so wonderful to watch.  Clark Gable is Mr. Charm.  The characters of Scarlett & Rhett are so remarkable.  He loves her because they are so much alike. She is a fool who thinks she loves another, someone so unlike herself.  Scarlett is a pretty unlikeable person, but extremely strong.  Rhett is a rogue, but likeable. Personally, I think they would definitely get back together."
scottgeorge,"Apr 27, 2003",10/10,"Unarguably, one of cinema's finest achievements and , arguably, the most popular film of all time.  Get your favorite snack and drink, pop in the dvd and just enjoy.  At almost 4 hours long, rarely does this classic drag. It is an engrossing antebellum soap opera that exceeds the novel in drama and scope and excellence (a rarity).  So much has been said of this movie that accolades from me would just be piling on.  Suffice to say, the production values are beyond top notch.  You actually are viewing 1860's Carolina and Georgia.  The acting is so good, the actors were type cast for years after. Specifically, Vivian Leigh never ever got past the Scarlett O'hara character with the possible exception of Streetcar.  The film won 10 Oscars and rightly so.  This in what had to be the toughest competitive year ever -- 1939.  For those Widescreen buffs (me included), note the dvd is only in fullscreen simply because that is the original format.  This was before Panavision and Cinemascope.  Definitely a 10 out of 10."

Keremaytc,"Dec 22, 2025",9/10,"A timeless classic. It beautifully portrays love, hope, and never giving up. It was difficult to make such a magnificent film in 1939. The story never drags for a second. The film draws you in, and you feel empty after the ending. The film ends somewhat unclear but still emphasizes hope. The character development is excellent. Rhett's charisma and his love for Scarlett are beautifully portrayed. He is in love but never allows himself to be in a submissive position. Their egos constantly clash. Scarlett realizes her love too late cause of the love for Ashley, but there is no turning back. Beyond love, it also beautifully depicts war and destruction. The way the aristocrats treat the slaves shows how big a problem racism was in the old days. Finally don't be fooled by the film's length (it fooled me and I watched this masterpiece so late) it never bores you and every second is wonderful."
AliAl-Khafaji,"Aug 12, 2025",10/10,"Gone with the Wind is more than a classic film; it's a living, breathing document of a historical moment, rich with emotional, social, and political depth. What makes it truly remarkable? The events. The sweeping narrative that carries us through the American Civil War era-not through dry politics, but through the lives, struggles, and passions of unforgettable characters.The film serves as a visual archive of the South before and after the war. From golden fields to the ruins of battle, every frame feels like a painted canvas, capturing history not as mere facts, but as lived experience.Scarlett O'Hara, with her layered complexity, embodies resilience and defiance, while Rhett Butler offers a piercing, unfiltered view of reality. Yet the brilliance isn't limited to the leads-every actor contributes something vital. From servants to soldiers, each performance adds texture to this fully realized world.The score, the costumes, the dialogue-even the silences-work in harmony to create a film that is unforgettable. Gone with the Wind documents time, immortalizes humanity, and invites us to live history from within.Final Rating: 10/10
A cinematic, documentary, human, and aesthetic masterpiece... impossible to replicate."
quincy-white,"Apr 22, 2007",N/A,"I've never been that interested in seeing this movie, but I finally decided to watch it, to see what the deal was. In the opening scroll, as it described the glories of the Old South, it spoke of 'Here was the last ever to be seen of Knights and their Ladies Fair, of Master and of Slave...' My mouth hung open. I couldn't believe it was so overt about slavery. I expected it to circumvent the issue, much like The Patriot and Cold Mountain today. Instead Gone with the Wind glorified slavery, right in the opening act a character decries the North for telling them they can't have slaves.We see Black children fanning napping White women, an abhorrent image. Blacks working in the cotton fields seem to be having the time of their lives. In the post-Civil War years, the character of Ashley talks of how well-treated he treated slaves, never mind that they were human beings treated as property. Ashley saying he would have freed them is a nice way to evade what he was.As days went by and I couldn't get Scarlett always saying 'fiddle-dee-dee' out of my head, I realized I also hated this movie as a movie. As so many old movies, it was completely overacted. The colors were too good for their own good, bright to the point of being fake. The more realistic colors of today are a vast improvement over the gaudy colors of old.I will admit Scarlett's escape with woman and child as Atlanta burns was well done. There is room for moral complexity in this movie. People fighting on the wrong side still have romantic entanglements, and still are devastated by the effects of war. Rhett and Scarlett could be seen as flawed characters not just because of personality but because of racism. But there is not much room for moral complexity in Gone with the Wind, it takes a clear stand.Unlike DW Griffith's Birth of a Nation, Gone with the Wind does not have the KKK riding in as heroes in the last act, instead its last act was tedious and overly weepy. However its portrayal of Reconstruction South was not much different than Birth of a Nation, with Blacks as either newly wealthy bullies or animalistic rapists of White women.Gone with the Wind does have important technical and artistic innovations, but so did Birth of a Nation. The difference is that with Birth of a Nation there is no separation. You cannot talk about Griffith's innovations without talking about his abhorrent politics. Gone with the Wind seems to get a free pass. The majority of IMDb reviews do not talk much about the racism. I found the usual digs at CGI in today's movies to carry an irony. The CGI alien character of Jar-Jar Binks is reviled as a racial stereotype, where as the flesh-and-blood racial stereotypes of Gone with the Wind are mostly ignored.What is most shocking is that to this day liberal Hollywood, and liberal critics, celebrate Gone with the Wind as a masterpiece, while ignoring and apologizing for its overt racism, which went beyond the usual stereotypes of the time, but in fact idealized the slave-owning South. How can this be?"
l-tobler,"Mar 17, 2014",7/10,"I get why Gone with the Wind is probably the most successful film of all time. It's romantic in every sense of the word. It's beautifully shot and has excellent visual composition, showcasing the old South in all its old-style charm and gloriousness. There's also romantically belligerent sexual tension galore between the two protagonists, which always makes for a good time. With Rhett or without him, Scarlett consistently manages to be infuriatingly immature in her actions throughout the film. However, she maintains some redeeming appeal: as bratty and selfish as Scarlett is, she is also bold and daring. And a hopeless romantic, a quality that appears in pretty much every character in the film."
williwaw,"Jul 25, 2011",10/10,"Irene Mayer Selznick wrote when the titles of this film appeared on the screen during the sneak preview of this great film she wept and could not stop crying. Deeply Mrs. Selznick knew that David Selznick bet all on this film, that he was obsessed with the film and that in a way He loved it more than David Selznick loved his wife. When one thinks of 1939 and the way this Film advanced film, that Selznick took a civil war story and made it the most famous and possibly one of the greatest films of all time, perhaps the American screen has regressed since 1939. Nowadays all we get is too much Special Effects.Casting Scarlett O Hara, Selznick built up a PR frenzy among the public as great stars such as Norma Shearer, Katharine Hepburn, Jean Arthur were mentioned as well as then newcomers Susan Hayward and Lana Turner. Bette Davis went to her grave wishing she had been cast as Scarlett. Other stars tested were Lucille Ball, Joan Benneet and Paulette Goddard who looked like the likely selection until one night Vivien Leigh appeared on the Selznick back lot. From then on Vivien Leigh 'became' Scarlett O Hara and gave one of the screen's greatest performances and won the Academy Award.Superbly produced by David Selznick at Selznick International and released thru then mighty MGM, and directed by Vincent Flemming, Gone With The Wind is one of the greatest films of all time and indexed for inflation, the biggest moneymaker of all time. George Cukor had been Director but Selznick fired Cukor. In retrospect a wise move as I do not think Cukor could have directed the action and Civil War battle scenes as Flemming did.Clark Gable is a dashing and great Rhett Butler, and splendid support by Olivia De Havilland Leslie Howard with a peerless performance by Hattie McDaniel who infuses soul into her great performance and justly won the Oscar. Costumes, Set and Art Direction, Cinematography are all tops with a thrilling score. This movie advanced the picture making into a modern era.David Selznick ever the gambler won his gamble, but would soon lose his wife due to his affair with Jennifer Jones. And ironically while creating the second greatest female star of her era (after the great Garbo), Vivien Leigh and David Selznick never made another movie together. Irene Selznick's powerful tears were momentous not only for the success of this film, the impending failure of her marriage and Selznick's eventual decline.Film scholars should read ""Memo From David O Selznick"" -one of the most intensive books ever on the life of DOS and ""Showman"" by David Thomson for more info on Gone With The Wind"

clydestuff,"Feb 11, 2004",10/10,"When I was very young, my parents would often load her eight kids into the car to see a double feature at the drive-in.  Occasionally, we were able to go to the matinee at a walk-in theater, but that was the exception rather than the rule.  There was only one occasion that I recall my mother having ventured into a regular movie theater.  That time was during a re-release of Gone With The Wind.  I knew that for her to do something so out of the ordinary would take an extraordinary event.  Because it was her all time favorite film which she had often spoken of, there was no doubt that Gone With The Wind was an exceptional film in her eyes.  The question that remains is whether it would be such a prodigious event for me.I enjoyed my first viewing of Gone With The Wind.  It didn't bore me.  Yet, I hardly remember it being unforgettable which is understandable when you're thirteen years old.  I tried reading Margaret Mitchell's novel once and believe I made it more than half way through.  It was not until years later after having viewed the film several more times that I began to appreciate the epic grandeur of Selznick's film.Many have classified Gone With The Wind as a love story told against the backdrop of the Civil War.   I think that is an oversimplification.  Though, there is a love story involved, this is strictly a film about a woman, who happens to want a man she can't have, but ends up with those men who suit her purpose to further her needs.Scarlett O'Hara is on the surface, a spoiled rich Southern belle.  In the barbecue at Twelve Oaks, we find her conniving schemes to corral Ashley Wilkes almost humorous.   As the film progresses, and the brutality of the Civil War and its aftermath, envelop the South,   we see changes take place in Scarlett as well.  As she matures into womanhood, Scarlett remains the conniving schemer, but becomes an extremely complex character also.  Until the war, her conniving is strictly that of a lovesick teenager.  After the war her schemes are those of a woman hardened by the brutality of a vicious war, and her plans serve a distinct and powerful purpose.  We may not agree with what she does or how she does it, but we understand her motivations.To bring Scarlett to life on the screen, Selznick chose Vivien Leigh. Whether it was pure luck or fate it doesn't matter.  I can think of no other actress who could have possibly fitted the role as well as Leigh does.   If I had to name the top ten performances by an actress in a film ever, Leigh would certainly be in the top ten if not at the top of the list.Rhett Butler is the male version of Scarlett in many ways.  At one point in the film Rhett brings this fact up himself. `Because we're alike - bad lots both of us, selfish and shrewd, but able to look things in the eyes and call them by their right names', he states.  He loves Scarlett, yet for most of the film she is out of his reach.  Only when it suits her purposes, does Scarlett give in to him.  She marries him not for love but for fun.  She may indeed love Rhett, because she is stubborn and self-centered, Scarlett can't acknowledge it.  Just as Vivien Leigh is the only actress I can picture as Scarlett, Clark Gable is the definitive Rhett.  There is no denying the chemistry between Rhett and Scarlett when these two great actors are on the screen together.  I have seen many of Gable's films, and have never seen him as good as he is in Gone With The Wind.If the film has one flaw for me in the acting department, it's Leslie Howard's Ashley Wilkes.  Although Ashley is a noble character, he is weak and wishy washy.  He is unable to tell Scarlett his true feelings one way or the other, yet is able to fight nobly for the Confederacy.  Howard manages to convey the indecisiveness and the weaknesses of the character, yet he fails to do anything to have us believe there is a reason why someone as strong willed as Scarlett might find him remotely attractive.Melanie Hamilton Wilkes epitomizes the example of pure goodness and greatness that one could only hope to achieve in life.  Yet, she sees in Scarlett a zest for living that seems to be unattainable to herself. Because of this and the fact that she finds it difficult to find the evil in anyone, Melanie is blinded to Scarlett's love for Ashley.  Olivia de Havilland gives us a Melanie every bit as real as Rhett and Scarlett.Of all the characters in Gone With The Wind, Mammy is the one who is shrewd enough and smart enough to see everyone for what they really are.   It is a fact that continually infuriates Scarlett.  Hattie McDaniel's  Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her portrayal of  Mammy may be the most deserving of all.  When she is on the screen, her presence overshadows that of even Leigh.For all of Selznick's attention to detail, for all the grandeur of the Southern Plantations, for the incredible scenes of the burning of Atlanta and the long back wards crane shot of the thousands of wounded soldier lying in the streets, without the complex characters, and the incredible performances by the actors to portray them, Gone With The Wind would quite possibly have never achieved the historical significance that it has.  It is this fact that makes it a great film.My Grade A+"
aidosh94,"Oct 15, 2007",10/10,"Wow, this was an astonishing movie. The acting, the story, the camera-work. Everything was superb. Vivien Leigh gives one of the greatest performances ever, as Scarlett O'Hara, the rich, beautiful girl who ends up marrying a bunch of guys and as the story goes, very beautifully I might add, problems and complications come between her and her men. Clark Gable is unforgettable as Rhett Butler, the man who Scarlett then finds out that he's the man who she really loves, but then it's too late. But, personally I believe that everything will be OK, ""After all... tomorrow is another day."" I got really touchy there... The point is that this is a masterpiece, a classic, and that it will continue to entertain and move people, just like it has for the past seventy years.Thanks"
Katseyefan_567,"Sep 10, 2025",10/10,My favorite movie. Sure it may be long but it is so good. You know I had to give it a 10 star. Vivien did such a good job with Scarlet nobody else could do better. Honestly all of the actors were really good in their parts. Some parts are sad. Just be aware there are parts where Scarlet has slaves because she was in the south. So if you will get angry at that I will not recommend. Also there is blood in one scene. But overall great movie.
hyattjenny18,"Nov 12, 2020",8/10,"The first time I watched Gone With the Wind was at school, it was required. I was not a fan of the movie the acting was good, the costumes amazing, the sets great, but in my opinion some of the story line didn't make sense. Reading the book GWTW highlighted and explained the storyline issues I had with the movie. For anyone who has watched the movie and enjoyed it or for people out there who had an issue with the storylines in the movie adaptation not making since one really needs to read the book.Their is a sequel that finishes the story ""Scarlett""Because the actors are different between Gone With The Wind and Scarlett one has to think of the movie adaptation as a continuation of the GWTW saga and not compare the actors from GWTW and Scarlett to or against each other. One has to go into watching both movies accepting three things, one that many years had passed between when GWTW and Scarlett were made. Two that each book the movies were based on were written by two different people. Three that the scripts were created in different times in history and by different people."
ladedi2000,"Feb 19, 2003",10/10,"Ever since I first saw this film when I was 12 on the centennial of the Civil War, I have been enthralled with it.  My mother took me into Boston to see the film and as I remember, it was a really poor quality print. Rather yellowish and scratchy.  It didn't matter - that started me on my life-long love of the Civil War and history in general.  It has also made me visit just about every major Civil War battlefield in the United States, as well as plantation homes and other significant sites throughout the South.What a fabulous film!  Really first-rate and amazingly so when you know the difficulties that Selznick went through to get it to the screen.  This ranged from casting challenges to director and script changes.It does stand the test of time well.  I have noticed that there is another whole new generation of GWTW lovers coming up.  My friend and I took our two young daughters to see the newest digitally mastered print that recently was released. (It was great to see the film in a theater again with great sound...)As always, (and wherever and whenever I have seen it), the first shot of Clark Gable produced gasps from the audience.  It is shot from the top of the staircase at the Wilkes mansion during the barbeque and we see Rhett Butler from Scarlett's viewpoint, when she first sees him.  The camera pans down to his face, as he is leaning on the bannister, looking up at her. I have never seen this film, when that shot of Gable failed to elict sighs from the audience.Anyway, our daughters loved the film and we hope that they will continue to enjoy it and pass it on.  Its that type of film - one to be enjoyed over and over again.  Even with all the times that I have seen it, I rarely watch it without seeing one or two new things.  That's the mark of a great and timeless film - which ""Gone With the Wind"" is!"
hrow,"Aug 22, 2004",N/A,"Being an American who grew up in the south, I have a little extra knowledge of what the movie Gone With the Wind is about. When you talk to people in the southeastern states, sooner or later you're going to hear about the Civil War, because that subject is still under serious debate there, and there are a great number of people who are experts. Margaret Mitchell herself said that when she was a child she heard very many personal remembrances of that time, and in fact she was steeped in the living memory of the Civil War period.The book that she wrote is a recreation of that period, and the movie is a sort of living portrait drawn from the book. Even though the very strong characters of the story occupy the center of the stage, still the background is just as important, being the result of Margaret Mitchell's need to give expression to all she knew about the agony of the Civil War, still living so vividly in the minds of so many people in America."
Quinoa1984,"May 21, 2017",7/10,"Gone with the Wind is a gorgeously polished rancid-egg of a Hollywood spectacle. I want to say 'turd', but that's not entirely fair. It's got perhaps THE most awful protagonist in popular cinema - and Rhett Butler isn't too far behind, though at least Gable finds some of the smirk in the performance - while De Havilland is the one who gets it unironically and Howard is completely adrift and knowing he's fatally miscast. It's maximum effort and art and craft and production ingenuity in service of a story where the character doesn't grow (or, if she does, it's a fake and she goes back to being the spoiled 'fiddle-dee-dee' brat of the world) and seriously lags in the 2nd half until a lot of people start dying and/or get hurt.Oh, and the ""I'll never go hungry again!"" bit makes no sense."

But because it not only focuses on the mundane - it emphasizes the mundane.Casablanca and Dr. Zhivago are both 'love story' classics I'd give a 10.I can't imagine how boring this novel is.I have no doubt the female author spends pages on the different types of lace doilies.I can see why it got praised for the technical achievements of its day - but I guarantee every husband dragged to it was dying inside, sitting through it.The best part are the words scrolling in the beginning.It's all downhill from there."

As the vastly irritating Scarlett O'Hara, Vivian Leigh tested the strength of my vow not to hit the ""Mute"" button on my remote.The production values are decent, but that doesn't come close to compensating for a ridiculous script based on a ridiculous novel by Margaret Mitchell.If you want a TRUE epic, go watch ""The Godfather.""  If you want an example of how a big box office can vastly exaggerate the public view of a horrible film, watch ""Titanic"" or this."

lasttimeisaw,"Jun 8, 2015",8/10,"Some movies you always know you will watch and you must watch, simply because it is a must-see and GONE WITH THE WIND is definitely one of them, hailed as ""the greatest film of all time"", how can I hold it up until now? Personally I can never find a right time to watch it not just because of its nearly 4-hour running time, also subjectively I am not a fan of Clark Gable, as he perpetually reeks of bad breath (thanks to the IMDb trivia section to ruin his silver-screen charisma for me), and feel daunted by the melodramatic nature of its source novel from Margaret Mitchell, but the moment has finally arrived and I have watched it for the very first time, and it is as good as I could ever anticipated, although with an epithet like ""the greatest of all time"", how can any film hold out on that supreme crown unscathed?The movie is an American civil war saga entirely enters on Scarlett O'Hara (Leigh), a crafty Southern belle whose comfortable life has been ravaged by the war, oscillates between the man of her dream Ashley Wilkes (Howard), who marries Melanie (de Havilland), a girl with all the virtues of that bygone era, and her similar kind, the rich pursuer Rhett Butler (Gable), it takes her three marriages, two dead husbands, one miscarriage, a devastating loss of her young child to finally realise her deepest love for Rhett, only in the end, she is unable to mend her fence with the overdue repentance, she has been a fool to chase her ideal yet unrealistic passion for Ashley, which is merely an illusion for her to grasp in troubled times. So she is the only one to blame for all the misfortunes? Almost eighty years later, my take is that Ashley and Rhett are equally accountable for the love triangle tug-of-war, it is the battle of sexes, Ashley is too weak-minded to disclose the wrong facade of his true feelings towards Scarlett, or, even worse, he gloats in the admiration of a woman who adores him as the specimen of a perfect man, either ways, he cannot be exonerated for acquiescing Scarlett's unrequited ardour. As for Rhett, his frivolous manner firstly establishes a wrong impression that he is a philanderer, charming but never the marry kind, and when he realises his feelings for her, his devotion is markedly undermined by jealousy, which only pushes Scarlett farther away, so why on earth he can act as all the justice is on his side and desert her when she eventually wakes up from her protracted mirage? On the other hand, it is all their imperfections make them a perfect match for each other, for sure their life together will not be perfect, but they cannot stand one without each other, that's the essence of monogamy.One sure thing is that the film's epic production scope and grandiose settings signal the hallmark of Hollywood's cutting-edge creativity and capability at then, its vividly expressive cinematography alone can captivate the utter veneration from even the fiercest dissenter. It is so incredible, how come Victor Fleming can master two cinematic juggernauts (this and THE WIZARD OF OZ, George Cukor is the poor guy uncredited with both pictures) in one calendar year, 1939 is really the high tide of the world cinema, symbols the celluloid industry enters its full-grown era.An iconic performance from Vivien Leigh, her Scarlett is never a damsel-in-distress, she is a spoilt and wilful brat at first, life is too easy for her to get what she wants, but her iron- willed personality has been mould after the baptism of the civil war, nothing can pull her back into poverty, she has a cunning mind of manipulation, mostly towards men who are too upright to run away from her smug calculations, only Rhett is her match to fence back, but she saves her most precious and vulnerable part for Ashley, and involuntarily grows close with Melanie too. As a Briton, Ms. Leigh brilliantly nails the southern accent, wholeheartedly teases out Scarlett's rite-of-passage and culminates a timeless performance allows generations to idolise. The same cannot be said to Clark Garble and Leslie Howard, male characters are uniformly given less range to leave the same impression as Scarlett, or even Olivia de Havilland's Melanie, who undertakes the burden of being an immaculate saint, fully embodies all the good virtues of humanity, but must face the cruelty of destiny, it is a tremendous blessing Ms. de Havilland is still with us today, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish she will safely pass her centenary 1st July next year.One cannot review this film without mentioning Hattie McDaniel's historic Oscar win as the faithful servant Mammy, in retrospect it is exactly what one would expect from under that social current, sans the horror one might trigger from 12 YEARS OF SLAVE (2013). Despite that her view towards the war has never been explored on the screen, anyhow it is a war under the name of abolishing slavery, yet she never leave O'Hara family even in the worst times, maybe her side of story can more accurately point out the sinister nitty-gritty of war, any kind of war, no matter under what name men are fighting their lives for, it is always a go-to manoeuvre to openly sacrifice innocent lives in exchange of benefits for the few ones, and it is a crime at any rate.Sorry for the digression, all in all, the film is a worthy classic, a bit too mushy in its second half for my taste, but one cannot hold too much grudge against it for all the genius involved and the first-rate end-product it hatches, an 8 out of 10 is my verdict."
norahthebadgerwombat,"Dec 18, 2017",10/10,"I watched this movie for the first time at fourteen years old. I enjoyed it immensely. I have always been a fanatic for anything Civil War themed, so when my mother recommended it to me, it was a yes from the start. The opening scenes show the young Scarlett O'Hara as she awaits her father's arrival. Beloved in the eyes of all the men in the county, Scarlett has acquired a high self-esteem, but when the War is announced to come after all, the high-spirited Scarlett soon faces obstacles that are determined to destroy her faith and her hope. She meets many people along the way, she even gets married. With new relationships, new responsibilities come as well. Rhett Butler, a man determined to have Scarlett for his own, comes into her life half way through both the novel and the movie, and he fights her on topics such as love, politics and societal roles. Even after the Civil War, Scarlett is still faced with many decisions. She has faced death, marriage and defeat many times. Still willing to go on, even when it seemed impossible, Scarlett leaves us with the last quote of the novel and book, ""After all, tomorrow is another day."""
elinagazarova,"Jun 15, 2020",10/10,The best classic movie love it. I wish there are more movies like this. Now days movies are boring and very artificial.
SameirAli,"Feb 2, 2017",10/10,"Almost 4 hours long, Gone with the Wind makes the longest running movie to win an Oscar for the best picture. The movie was a milestone in the history of film making.The movie is a wonderful visual treat. Too long, but very engaging, once you start watching, you cant stop.The story is about a young beautiful girl called Scarlett. She is born in a rich family. She was in love with a man, but he marries another woman. The war begins and he has to go for the war. Scarlett was asked to look after his wife. She keeps her word and take good care of her. The war brings disaster and misfortune to the country. Then its a struggling period. Scarlett works hard and keeps her strength to overcome the problems and get back the old wonderful days.Nominated for 13 categories and won 8 of them at the Oscars. Along with many records, it is the first color movie to win Oscar for the best picture.A must watch. Highly recommended.#KiduMovie"
weekly-movie-review,"Dec 23, 2008",10/10,"Gone With The Wind is one of those absolutely essential films that all movie lovers must see before they die. This Civil War epic romance/drama centers around a rather spoiled and selfish young Southern belle named Scarlett. The story follows her through the blissful paradises of plantation dances and pretty dresses to the bitter, cold realities of war and scraping up the pieces afterward. During these trials and tribulations, many very complex relationships and people are examined, all the while using Scarlett as the catalyst. Victor Fleming's visual interpretation of Margaret Mitchell's famous novel is nearly flawless and represents, in my opinion, exactly how a story like this should be told. The lavish sets and costumes burst from the screen in an explosion of color. The cinematography and visual effects evoke a certain dream-like fantasy at certain times and offer stunning realism at others. It's hard to believe this movie was made 70 years ago and it's easy to see why this movie was considered so far ahead of its time upon its release. However, as great as these elements are, the aspect that makes Gone With The Wind a timeless classic is the great performance by the cast. Most have heard of Vivien Leigh's career-defining performance as Scarlett and the way she makes the viewer both love her and hate her with equally burning passions, or of Clark Gable's equally good role as Rhett Bulter, the self-reliant, and some might say, self-centered man who comes to understand the value of integrity and character. But sometimes these two giants overshadow very underrated performances by Leslie Howard, Hattie McDaniel, and Olivia de Havilland. Leslie Howard does a tremendous job of relating to the viewer the inner torment of love versus lust that his character deals with everyday. McDaniel offers a lovable toughness, wisdom, and discipline as the house servant. De Havilland's performance is the most pleasantly surprising, however. In every scene, her character emits purity and goodness in abundance. She truly demonstrates an unconditional love to all those around her despite the difficult circumstances she often finds herself in and is the perfect example of the model that other humans should aspire to become. Through and through, Gone With The Wind is a story that will probably never grow irrelevant, and this 4-hour movie is an astonishing masterpiece that is able to bring deep-buried emotions out of even the most hardened of hearts."
Incalculacable,"Feb 11, 2006",9/10,"You can easily Gone with the Wind is the Mother of all movies. Glorious Technicolor, magnificent cast who make their characters their own, wonderful landscapes, excellent, beautiful costumes, rich and warm music, true and believable acting. And the beauty of this movie that it could have been made yesterday - it truly looks like it. Sometimes I just watch it and not pay attention to the characters, just look at the landscapes, decor and dresses, however that is hard to do because the characters are so darn interesting. I find Rhett and Scarlett hard to hate. Rhett because obviously he is very attractive and kind, despite going to prostitutes. Scarlett has been through so much and can be very kind sometimes, but on the other hand she is a manipulative, difficult so-and-so. After you see this movie, you cannot imagine anyone else in these roles. Thanks to the Four Disk Special Edition, you can see who came very close to claiming the roles (the special edition DVD is a must for any devoted Gone With The Wind fan - the special features are wonderful!! The only thing that I was disappointed with is that there are no outtakes! Outtakes are the best! But it is a very valuable, informative DVD.) I love Gone With The Wind. It is one of the most memorable, tragic, hopeful, glorious, extravagant, wonderful, explosive, sultry, sad, bittersweet movies I have ever seen, and I shall carry the experience along with me for the rest of my life."
burgan6203,"Sep 29, 2004",3/10,"I'll state right off the bat that the cinematography and art direction of ""Gone With the Wind"" is extraordinary,and ahead of its time. I will also say that is were my liking for the film ends.The fact that the heroine is a manipulative bitch who doesn't care about anyone but herself(contrary to popular belief, Scarlett DOES NOT love Ashley OR Rhett and as for Tara,it's basically an extension of herself), coupled with a skewed, disgustingly idolatrous view of the American South and the Civil War in general is probably the most honest reason for my intense dislike for this film(as well as the book).I admit to empathizing with two characters: Melanie and Mammy. The former because she is everything that Scarlett is not, and the latter because she's the one that sees through Scarlett.For a meaningful Civil War story, I pick ""Cold Mountain""(film and book both) over ""Gone With the Wind(book and film both) any day."
